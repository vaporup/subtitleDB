1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Fine, but...

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,000
You are insurance broker?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My last name's Cheuk

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Mr. Cheuk

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's getting more and more complex

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,400
You come so far to indemnify. Very nice

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:15,828
Stay for dinner

8
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,399
Sure, sure

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,178
What is that?

10
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:28,652
Watch it. You'll know

11
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:30,878
I'll watch it later

12
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:37,657
Mr. Cheuk

13
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:42,224
Mr. Cheuk, he's calling you

14
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:43,798
Mr. Cheuk

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,030
You are hard-working

16
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,737
Still working while on leave

17
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,068
I want to settle this quick for Onion

18
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,502
Dr. Woo, you work hard too

19
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,079
Ain't you on leave?

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,110
Mr. Cheuk, I think we never met

21
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,854
How do you know my name?

22
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:08,250
We never met...

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,085
Doing insurance

24
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:11,422
you had to know everything

25
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:13,223
Onion died too suddenly

26
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,889
We had to check people out

27
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,670
Occupational disease. Blind guess

28
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:26,277
Mr. Cheuk, you look not well

29
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,277
Your lips are dark

30
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:32,116
You better have a check

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,384
It's professional. Not blind guess

32
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,790
I queued and

33
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:44,258
bought a cheese cake

34
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:46,559
For dessert

35
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:49,092
Try it. You'll feel better

36
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,803
Autumn hates cheese

37
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,095
She only likes fruit candies

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,965
The octagon ones in colorful cans

39
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,135
I can't believe it

40
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:04,944
You know even that others like to eat?

41
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:09,248
I don't eat cheese

42
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:15,192
Why do you know?

43
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:16,520
Are you checking on me?

44
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,290
You think I killed him?

45
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,589
No... How could I?

46
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,289
I don't mean it

47
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,099
In fact, I am...

48
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,562
Here it comes again

49
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:27,568
What's the matter with you?

50
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:28,938
How's it going?

51
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,568
Sis, do you have slippers?

52
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,274
For men or women?

53
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,675
Better check out...

54
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:38,373
the nearest hospital

55
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,608
Just in case...

56
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:42,418
Autumn?

57
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:46,615
Back in her room. She's pissed off

58
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:48,986
I didn't mean it

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,157
I didn't check on her. Please tell her

60
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,589
Okay, okay...

61
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,659
You threw...

62
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,493
everything up

63
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:56,958
Have some cheese cake

64
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:58,000
Sis

65
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:01,001
The doctors often suggest...

66
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:02,935
...not to eat too rich after vomiting

67
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:05,842
No cheese cake. You have something flat?

68
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,411
Apple

69
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,513
Have it

70
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,674
Can we talk,

71
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,613
Dr. Woo?

72
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:15,615
Sure

73
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,692
Can we donate Onion's money...

74
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,352
to the hospital...

75
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:27,422
...for ophthalmology studies?

76
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:28,623
He wished to help

77
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:32,867
Sure. I can suggest to the hospital...

78
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,302
...to launch a fund...

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,499
for the blind people

80
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,509
I thought you really were busy,

81
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:49,984
have no time to go to concerts

82
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,350
Now I know

83
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:55,459
I am quite jealous of him

84
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:58,519
Sorry,

85
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:01,131
it seems not respectful

86
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:03,858
I think...

87
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,833
he doesn't want to see you like that

88
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,945
Could we go to concert tomorrow night?

89
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:18,847
Can we talk tomorrow?

90
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,378
Hope to see you tomorrow

91
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,218
It's getting cold. Let's go in

92
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:33,559
It's late. Please go

93
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,598
Give Mr. Cheuk a ride, would you?

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,896
Where's Mr. Cheuk?

95
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:57,251
I don't know what you want

96
00:04:58,389 --> 00:04:59,378
I won't...

97
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:02,583
Iet you hurt Autumn

98
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:08,831
I don't have time. Stop the car

99
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,035
You want to vomit?

100
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,509
Thanks for having taken care of Onion

101
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:22,745
Bye

102
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:27,014
Where are you going?

103
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:30,249
I won't let you go back and bug Autumn!

104
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,959
Would you please get in?

105
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,164
I won't leave

106
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,959
I didn't ask you to leave

107
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,769
I won't let you bother Autumn

108
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:48,166
Let me go back with you

109
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,534
Okay?

110
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,580
Mr. Cheuk,

111
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:00,246
personally I don't like you

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,109
But...

113
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:04,585
you are a patient to me

114
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,418
You might get pneumonia,

115
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:08,547
triggering epilepsy

116
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,394
Get in, would you?

117
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:22,064
Thank you

118
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,507
I must keep an eye on you

119
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,206
You broke my car

120
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:30,775
I have to take you to the police

121
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,184
You like her

122
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:37,519
You do too

123
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:39,923
Right

124
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:43,723
She told me she cared about me

125
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,265
You've been in our hospital?

126
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,166
Did she take care of you?

127
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,501
But the way I see it...

128
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:02,543
I think you've got it all wrong

129
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,814
What do you mean?

130
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,581
Nurses always cares about patients

131
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,121
Especially someone like Autumn

132
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:13,989
But it's different from...

133
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,286
what you think

134
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:20,696
I am not saying this because I want her

135
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:22,156
I hope you get it

136
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:57,858
Didn't she read the letter?

137
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,264
Will she believe it?

138
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,138
Maybe she never ever like me

139
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,674
She just pities me

140
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,879
I am just a common patient to her

141
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,052
I know you want me to regret, right?

142
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,715
How could angels be so unkind?

143
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,513
Good morning

144
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,148
- Good morning
- Staying late?

145
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,717
No, I have a date with you

146
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,846
Not sure if I can get up. So I stay

147
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:54,613
Where is he?

148
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,418
Who?

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,391
Mr. Cheuk! My car's locked

150
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:58,658
He didn't leave?

151
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,525
Never mind. I'll make some coffee

152
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,501
- Take a seat
- Okay

153
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:06,262
Could you give me a ride later?

154
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:07,262
Where to?

155
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,269
Anywhere, take a break, go to concert

156
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:12,733
Sure

157
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,158
Did you read it?

158
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:31,861
You wait a whole night here for that?

159
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:34,295
I read it

160
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,133
Good! You finally got it?

161
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,803
I am sorry... Mr. Angel

162
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:41,165
I was irrational

163
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:42,363
You didn't hear a thing

164
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:43,439
Are you alright?

165
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:46,735
Did you really read it?

166
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:48,334
Didn't miss anything?

167
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,638
I don't know what's in your apology card

168
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,010
And this tape's blank

169
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,519
But I accept your apology

170
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:58,617
Please proceed with my indemnity

171
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,050
and stay away from me afterward

172
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:08,689
If Mr. Cheuk ever comes...

173
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,800
to the hospital again

174
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:10,559
Do pay us a visit

175
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:11,429
We are in charge of ophthalmology

176
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:14,202
I know, I specialize in the blind

177
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:18,266
I'm always there. So I understand them

178
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:21,768
Sometimes I even touch their books

179
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:24,071
Like Onion's point diary

180
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:27,674
I know a lot from that

181
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:28,842
Diary?

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,644
I didn't know she'd react that way

183
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:32,919
Even ask me out tonight

184
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:34,613
She wants...

185
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,183
to see Onion's diary

186
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,687
But when did I write diary?

187
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:50,172
Sorry, I really can't...

188
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,906
It's okay. The show is boring

189
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:54,741
I'll take you back

190
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:58,274
No, it's fine. Thanks for the ticket

191
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:01,413
You have a date with someone?

192
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,053
Him

193
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:12,889
I can take care of myself

194
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,231
Give me a call if you need me

195
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:21,066
Diary, diary...

196
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:22,934
The whole diary in one day?

197
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,173
What the hell. No time

198
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:43,217
Excuse me. I am late

199
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,453
It's alright. I am early

200
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,396
This is...

201
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:53,164
I think you better not see it

202
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,600
You might feel upset

203
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:01,510
You know point alphabet?

204
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,041
Sure, more than ten years...

205
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:07,010
I specialize in the blind

206
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:10,486
Could you read it for me?

207
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,445
Okay

208
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:14,046
Where to start?

209
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,194
Where you met each other

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Sunny...

211
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Sunny...

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,500
That's it?

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,500
No, there's more...

214
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:32,480
October 16, 1997, Sunny, Vomit

215
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,000
Dr. Woo said it's medical reaction

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
A new nurse came taking care of me today

217
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Her name is Autumn Yue

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
She is clumsy

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
She kept saying...

220
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
"Sorry"

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
She made a mess,

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but I didn't pick on her

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I even feel good about her

224
00:12:57,673 --> 00:13:00,164
Why am I still talking fine?

225
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,470
She doesn't know that I am Onion

226
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,370
I am just someone reading Onion's diary

227
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,000
Go on

228
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:12,515
November 2nd, 1997, Rainy night

229
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:15,223
Autumn said she'll come give me...

230
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,192
a hair cut after work

231
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:22,193
It's raining so hard. She might not come

232
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:25,332
She is already 49 minutes late

233
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:28,030
Feeling disappointed,

234
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:30,738
I heard footsteps hurrying up

235
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,570
"Sorry..."

236
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,506
Sorry. I'm late again

237
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,206
49-minute is nothing

238
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,774
I was thrilled she came

239
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:44,909
Finally, she finished

240
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:47,218
It looked like an onion

241
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,518
She starts calling me Onion ever since

242
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:59,229
December 7, 1997, Sunday, Good day

243
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:03,137
It's the second time Autumn cut my hair

244
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,235
I can smell her

245
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:10,103
Just when I was enjoying

246
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,745
My left ear hurt so much suddenly

247
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,010
And I heard she keep saying...

248
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:16,676
I'm sorry

249
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,446
Oh, I cut you ear

250
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,920
You're bleeding. Are you okay...

251
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:26,118
I shook my head, saying: Nothing!

252
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,190
She's all freaked out, almost crying

253
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:32,491
If only I could talk, I'll say

254
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:36,827
I am so happy she comes

255
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,603
Just a little pain. No big deal

256
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,000
Enough!

257
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,041
Stop it

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,044
I am sorry. Please burn it

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,500
Wait!

260
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,646
He pointed all that,

261
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,050
and rub it on the street

262
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:55,753
Don't you want to know more?

263
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:58,250
What happen if I know it all?

264
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
You won't understand how I feel

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,395
Only Onion will

266
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:08,498
He's dead. What's the diary for?

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,499
To save your memory?

268
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:14,000
No

269
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,053
I say

270
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:37,294
Just now...

271
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,333
I felt Onion's back

272
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:41,960
I used to think I just pitied him

273
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,302
Then he died

274
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,334
And I realize

275
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:47,874
it is so painful without him

276
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,015
I love him all the time

277
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:02,346
Why didn't I tell him?

278
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:07,255
I wanted him to know

279
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:12,027
I wished he's the one playing sax

280
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:15,926
Why didn't I ask?

281
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:22,610
My second wish is to be with him

282
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,974
Why didn't I say it?

283
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:31,683
Now I can't

284
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:34,714
Can it start all over?

285
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:41,094
What's memory for?

286
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,295
Just one day...

287
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,994
Give me one more day, can I?

288
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,533
Please!

289
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:25,796
You!

290
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:28,006
Why did you crash him? Why?

291
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:28,837
None of my business...

292
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:31,879
He rushed out...

293
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:34,906
Come on! Hit me!

294
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:36,443
I have nothing after all!

295
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,086
I shouldn't have come back!

296
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,123
I shouldn't have. Let me go!

297
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:46,854
Hit me!

298
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,166
I miss you so much...

299
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,573
You always miss me, huh?

300
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:02,307
Sit

301
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,590
What do you want to drink?

302
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:21,361
Anything

303
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:26,833
Your daughter?

304
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:30,202
Salty Lemon Seven

305
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:34,865
Thank you

306
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,683
Not so much. You will drop dead

307
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:51,191
You want to die?

308
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,360
No, I don't

309
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:03,071
My neck sores. Give me a message

310
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:27,787
When are you leaving?

311
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,366
Taiwan

312
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,159
Two more days

313
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:36,699
Are you coming back?

314
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,232
No

315
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:43,344
Sit

316
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:52,815
You're leaving, why stir things up?

317
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:54,849
Can't take anything with you

318
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,483
I know now

319
00:19:57,826 --> 00:19:59,088
I just want to see her

320
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:01,953
If she's happy, I'll be happy

321
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:03,325
Now and see

322
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,462
Don't think too much

323
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:11,700
If she knew Onion's leaving again

324
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:14,268
She's be upset once again

325
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,441
What's that?

326
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,578
You want a florist shop, don't you?

327
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,775
My investment

328
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:28,886
Can't take it with me. Not in Taiwan

329
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:33,352
Okay

330
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,490
I'll sent you some later

331
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,895
What do you want there?

332
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,364
I'm going

333
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,213
Take care

334
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:56,182
Right...

335
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:02,951
If you see my daughter

336
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,550
Take good care of her

337
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:09,521
I will

338
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:16,461
Don't bug others anymore. Go

339
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:28,544
Not fair occupying other's thing

340
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:35,756
Hello, it's you

341
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:36,448
Me

342
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:39,527
Can't hear you. What's your name?

343
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:40,926
Cheuk

344
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:44,960
What do you want to talk about?

345
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,289
I wanted...

346
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:49,230
to phone-in long time ago

347
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:50,730
But I can't

348
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:52,199
In two days, I had to go

349
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,198
I've done everything

350
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,210
So I try this

351
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:58,336
Nothing special

352
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,038
You've done everything,

353
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:01,171
you feel good?

354
00:22:02,784 --> 00:22:05,810
Better than a few days ago

355
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,216
A few days ago?

356
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:09,881
You felt bad a few days ago, why?

357
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,986
I saw the reality of the world

358
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,321
Ugly world,

359
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,396
you mean?

360
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:19,163
No, not ugly

361
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:22,468
But seeing it through your eyes

362
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:24,732
The world's different

363
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:29,099
Through eyes, you'll have greed

364
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:32,407
You want to possess her

365
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:34,547
The eyes fool

366
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,777
Interesting

367
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,783
Give us more details

368
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:44,524
Try not to see with eyes

369
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,428
Quietly close your eyes

370
00:22:47,562 --> 00:22:50,963
In this minute of silence

371
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,263
Feel with your purest heart

372
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:58,873
You may find everything different

373
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:01,975
Feel the beauty and

374
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,941
happiness with heart

375
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:06,037
You'll have rooms...

376
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:07,910
of imagination

377
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:11,014
You seem to know yourself

378
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,488
Could you hold?

379
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:14,782
We'll talk more

380
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:16,254
Now, let's go to music

381
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:17,825
Okay, audience

382
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,426
If you have experience...

383
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:20,528
like Cheuk's

384
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:22,823
You might want to try

385
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:24,625
Close your eyes,

386
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,399
it may help

387
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:35,100
You scare me!

388
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:36,135
Sorry

389
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:55,817
I shouldn't call you so late

390
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,713
Never mind. What's the matter?

391
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,651
I know it is not scientific

392
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,349
But I really feel it, he's back

393
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,224
Slow down. Who's back?

394
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:09,557
Onion...

395
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,762
He's back with me

396
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:14,796
Very close

397
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:18,201
I don't believe in paranormal

398
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:20,065
I know how your feel

399
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:23,635
Just imagination. You miss him too much

400
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,271
It happens...

401
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:27,904
when a friend died

402
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:33,016
Should I come over?

403
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:34,178
That's not necessary

404
00:26:35,757 --> 00:26:36,815
I know what you mean

405
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:40,020
I know you'd say that

406
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:43,263
But it's not imagination

407
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:45,959
Onion is back

408
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:48,668
Okay now

409
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,435
Sorry, I bother you

410
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:52,970
Thanks. Good night

411
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:09,354
Good night

412
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:16,428
Good night

413
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,804
This is the real Cheuk

414
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:28,433
The one we met is a crook

415
00:27:29,878 --> 00:27:31,505
I've checked

416
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:33,273
He's on vacation, in US

417
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:35,348
For your own safety,

418
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:37,212
don't meet with him

419
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:38,751
Let's report to the police, shall we?

420
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:42,557
No. He didn't come again

421
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:45,418
Are you alright?

422
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,395
Take care of yourself

423
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:03,405
This is my final night

424
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:31,054
Why do you tail her all day?

425
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,129
Can you make her happy? I can help

426
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:07,926
That's not me

427
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:11,460
The one who played sax wasn't me

428
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,624
I don't want to lie to you

429
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:15,961
You mean Onion played it?

430
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:17,530
It's Cheuk

431
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:38,850
Cheuk!

432
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:42,728
Cheuk!

433
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:58,173
Cheuk! Cheuk...

434
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:20,214
Come out! Onion!

435
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:45,074
Cheuk! Onion, come out quick!

436
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,378
I know you're here!

437
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:58,951
You're not coming out, are you?

438
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:32,984
Are you okay?

439
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:34,458
What's wrong with you?

440
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:36,790
You want to kill yourself?

441
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:38,554
Stupid!

442
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:44,029
I should have known you're Onion

443
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:45,799
And you're the one who played sax

444
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,426
Onion!

445
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:19,535
Freeze, Onion!

446
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:22,969
I am not him

447
00:36:23,644 --> 00:36:27,273
Onion's blind and dumb, and dead

448
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,483
Stop imagining things

449
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:34,315
There's other for you. Such a fool!

450
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:38,587
I am the Cheuk. You know it

451
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,856
No, you're not

452
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:43,955
No, I'm not

453
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:48,602
I am a liar. I'm fooling you

454
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:50,226
You satisfy?

455
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:52,504
You've disliked me, haven't you?

456
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:54,666
Is there something...

457
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:57,641
you can't say?

458
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:00,043
Is there a special reason?

459
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:03,408
Why do you reject me?

460
00:37:05,553 --> 00:37:06,781
I didn't...

461
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:10,423
I am not him

462
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:12,757
Fine

463
00:37:13,628 --> 00:37:14,686
That night...

464
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:16,321
you just touched one line of the diary

465
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:17,260
and you told me...

466
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:18,660
everything about us

467
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:20,734
How could you know?

468
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,601
Unless you are Onion

469
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:29,367
It's fine you don't admit

470
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:33,439
You must have a reason

471
00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:36,241
Just don't leave me alone

472
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,816
I am so careless

473
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,487
I didn't realize

474
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:45,489
until I see all the proofs

475
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:48,461
I am so dumb

476
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,632
Are you going now?

477
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,605
Yes, I had to

478
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:05,201
You'll never see me again

479
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:08,615
I am not anyone...

480
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:12,543
Forget it, Onion is dead

481
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:15,112
He never comes back

482
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,817
You must take care yourself

483
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:21,086
Go! Go!

484
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:22,127
Okay!

485
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,156
Excuse me, please wait

486
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,268
I have one last question

487
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,672
If you were him,

488
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,302
Seeing the one he loves so painful

489
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:39,043
What do you want her to do?

490
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:49,017
Forget me and love someone else

491
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,583
Live happily again

492
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:56,425
Let go of the painful memories

493
00:38:57,765 --> 00:38:59,733
Okay! I'll tell him now

494
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:01,867
I've forgot his death

495
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,331
I won't carry the pains with me!

496
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:07,467
I will love someone again

497
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:10,810
And that's you!

498
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:13,808
But he stays...

499
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:16,178
in my heart

500
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:20,084
It's fine if you don't admit it

501
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:23,814
I don't care if you're Cheuk

502
00:39:25,426 --> 00:39:30,022
But I know, I always love...

503
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:31,889
Who is the one I always love

504
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:36,728
Onion, you listen up

505
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:39,097
I love this person in front of me!

506
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:43,876
Don't go away

507
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,041
Don't leave me alone...

508
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:29,179
This is...

509
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,756
the meteor shower night

510
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,390
China is the best place to see it

511
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:36,021
I'll be here with you tonight

512
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:38,293
Onion told me

513
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:41,727
Your first wish was that he could watch

514
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:44,667
the meteor shower with you

515
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,840
It's the same you watch it with me

516
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,210
There's no meteor shower yet

517
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:57,446
You're a good person. God will help you

518
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:01,017
Then help me keep Onion!

519
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:03,357
Stay with me forever, would you?

520
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,454
That's my second wish

521
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:16,701
Onion had a second wish too

522
00:41:18,672 --> 00:41:21,698
But it's already impossible...

523
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:25,076
It's 2:30 in the morning

524
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:26,372
Ten minutes to go...

525
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:28,778
for the peak hour

526
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:30,848
I wonder if Cheuk...

527
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:32,418
...will call again tonight

528
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,519
Hello, I'm Cheuk

529
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:46,157
I appreciate people caring about me

530
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:48,231
I want...

531
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:51,395
to say something to my love

532
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,070
Why not say it directly to her?

533
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:55,304
Because...

534
00:41:57,545 --> 00:41:58,978
of fate

535
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,105
When I didn't expect anything

536
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:05,480
I owned her love unexpectedly

537
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:09,588
When I wanted her...

538
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:12,119
or made a choice

539
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:15,721
she went away, disliked me

540
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:18,464
I am leaving soon

541
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,898
Keeping the most unforgettable moment

542
00:42:23,337 --> 00:42:26,465
Laughter or tears

543
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:29,133
I hope every bits of memory

544
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:32,209
be with the one I love most

545
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:37,149
Carry on with her life. Be strong...

546
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:44,249
Five days is very short

547
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:47,719
I want to tell friends in the air

548
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:51,624
Hold what you have

549
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,959
Now, or in the future

550
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,136
Even if it slips away...

551
00:43:02,076 --> 00:43:03,703
I have no regret of this life

552
00:43:07,848 --> 00:43:10,282
That's so touching

553
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:12,509
If only you were my boyfriend

554
00:43:13,187 --> 00:43:15,314
May I offer any help?

555
00:43:21,095 --> 00:43:22,357
Could you play a song...

556
00:43:23,264 --> 00:43:25,289
for my love?

557
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:36,939
Sure. Let's go for the meteor shower

558
00:43:38,245 --> 00:43:39,507
Before I hang up

559
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:43,911
I hope everyone close your eyes again

560
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:46,077
Feel the one...

561
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,084
by your side with your heart

562
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:52,452
You'll have better feeling

563
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,661
Meteor shower!

564
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:44,772
I've fulfilled my first wish

565
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:50,743
Make a wish, quick

566
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:00,151
No...

567
00:45:02,029 --> 00:45:04,725
I did last time, you still have to go

568
00:45:09,436 --> 00:45:10,027
Come back

569
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,139
when the meteor showers

570
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:31,450
"Wait for you"

571
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:35,180
Finally, I know what is meteor shower

572
00:46:36,623 --> 00:46:39,490
The tears of the sky...
