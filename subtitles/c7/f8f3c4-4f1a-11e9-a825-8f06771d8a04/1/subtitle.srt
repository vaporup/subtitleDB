1
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,005
Guess what I hear...

2
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,169
most in my life?

3
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,638
Are you blind?

4
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,673
A blind man shouldn't go out!

5
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,670
Bingo! That's it

6
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,439
Just want to tell him...

7
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,072
I can

8
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,549
But I did not say it

9
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,217
Because I am mute, too

10
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,482
Good morning, Onion!

11
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,115
Living here so long,

12
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,691
I know everyone

13
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,992
Like this who smells alcohol

14
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,187
He's Mr. Wong of the Security

15
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:38,889
Good morning, Onion!

16
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:39,930
A well-known stupid drunk

17
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,232
Hi, Onion!

18
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,836
You can tell I'm Chow? So quick!

19
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:47,735
I smell...

20
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,769
your perfume from far away

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,781
They even give me a place to live

22
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,715
Why? I work here doing what?

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,586
Recording doctor's verbal diagnosis

24
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,117
Thanks...

25
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,884
the Equal Opportunity Law in HK

26
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,551
The salary is okay

27
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,827
There are many medical experiments here

28
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,858
I'm in...

29
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,126
one blind-cure project

30
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,262
Though we often fail

31
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,567
Dr. Woo and

32
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,674
Autumn treat me nice

33
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,932
Especially Autumn

34
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,744
I'm not born blind

35
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,042
At eight,

36
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,809
I moved from Taiwan to Hong Kong

37
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,579
I was the best in school,

38
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:35,886
A genius

39
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,751
Then problem came

40
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,189
My eyes were always watery

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,654
Everything I saw was tinted

42
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:46,022
One day, I went swimming with girls

43
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,867
Show time. I did the fancy dive

44
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,397
From way up

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,871
While diving in, my eyes hurt

46
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,269
and bred

47
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,106
Too late

48
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,545
The retina already fell off

49
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,281
I knew I was blind

50
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,516
That night, I had brain fever

51
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,312
and lost my speaking ability

52
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,651
My families left one after another...

53
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:16,959
The noisy is...

54
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,495
my buddy Jumboball

55
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,792
What the hell? You walk like ghost!

56
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,029
Salty Lemon Seven, your favorite!

57
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,301
So much salts again! Sucker!

58
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,108
Can't you share?

59
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,447
Gobbling

60
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,887
Alright, your turn

61
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,685
Stop flopping around, here you go

62
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,086
What's the matter?

63
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,121
It has problem breathing?

64
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,423
You have problem

65
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:56,694
Tell me!

66
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,327
I know you can hear bird's talk

67
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,740
Constipation?

68
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,072
With such appetite? No way!

69
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,135
What are you getting?

70
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:08,876
What are you doing?

71
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,075
Don't pass it to my bird

72
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,120
Leave it alone. Bug me

73
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,588
Come here... homework time

74
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,053
A couple of good ones

75
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,630
I dreamt of my ungrateful daughter again

76
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,907
Salivating. Dead. Still on drug

77
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,642
You are better

78
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:43,877
What?

79
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,649
Queuing for a massage

80
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,343
You've got nothing to do?

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,879
You pay me, or I pay you?

82
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,751
Onion!...

83
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,724
And that's the news for today...

84
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,003
In...

85
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,765
our next program...

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,563
When I was little,

87
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,470
I wanted to phone-in the radio

88
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,301
Because ever since I was blind

89
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,242
Radio's my connection to the world

90
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,377
Hello

91
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,415
Hello, please talk

92
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,384
- Miss Autumn
- Thank you, fisherman

93
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,015
- Doc, your coffee
- Thanks

94
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,848
Is Onion throwing up badly?

95
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:25,886
Badly!

96
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,854
He's tough, more than others

97
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,528
Like last time, he didn't ask for help

98
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,860
And often jokes over it

99
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,800
I've notice. Usually you don't talk much

100
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,733
Except when you talk...

101
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,897
about the patients

102
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,870
Do you like music,

103
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,776
or jazz?

104
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,347
It's okay

105
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,113
Do you think...

106
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,277
listening to classical music or...

107
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,982
...playing sax is pretentious?

108
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,294
Not really. Sax's pretty good

109
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,424
As long as it's pleasant

110
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,054
Well, I know how to play it

111
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,665
Back in school, every time I played it,

112
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,697
My friends said I was pretentious

113
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,503
When foreigners' playing,

114
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,130
they said it's cool!

115
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,209
So, I often practice...

116
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,540
in the toilet

117
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,908
Even now, my sax comes with a taste

118
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,915
I think I've got too far

119
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,523
I have two concert tickets for tonight

120
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,793
Do you want to go?

121
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,992
No, the exam. I don't want to flunk it

122
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,296
That's true

123
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,925
Never mind, next time then

124
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,398
After all, failure is the mom of success

125
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,241
Sorry, I'm sorry, Onion...

126
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,450
So sorry, I'm late again

127
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,883
Have you been waiting long?

128
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,613
Sorry

129
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,388
It is the thirtieth time

130
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,619
she cuts my hair

131
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,559
I'm not too greedy

132
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,933
Just wish it happen...

133
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,865
863 times in my life

134
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,971
What are you thinking? Fallen asleep?

135
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,934
Did you have the apples I bought you?

136
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,382
You remember my birthday!

137
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,476
I just told you once

138
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:35,985
Thank you!

139
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,649
Someone said

140
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,056
I'm clumsy today

141
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,522
No? Really?

142
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:45,761
If people has...

143
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,297
one disadvantage

144
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,401
God shall give him one advantage

145
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,127
If you get a lousy body,

146
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,601
you'll get a good brain

147
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,004
If you are not pretty,

148
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,334
you'll get a nice voice

149
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,467
Why I have nothing,

150
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,568
and get fat?

151
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:01,914
It's all your fault!

152
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,409
Give ma all! Yummy!

153
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,478
What advantage do you have?

154
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,587
Two?

155
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,300
Right, you have more

156
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,662
You can't see...

157
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,494
how ugly I am

158
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,036
And you won't...

159
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,333
tell my secrets

160
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,176
So...

161
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,040
I feel very safe with you

162
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,272
You are the only one I can talk to

163
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,154
If you don't want to listen,

164
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,278
tell me

165
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,619
You really don't?

166
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,895
Don't like it?

167
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,859
Don't rub your nose!

168
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,897
I'm just kidding

169
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,803
Did you hear?

170
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,045
I heard it again last night

171
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,105
Don't know why

172
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,771
Every time I hear it

173
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,147
I feel relax

174
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,286
Dr. Woo said he could play it

175
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,523
But it's not him, I'm sure

176
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,651
He can't play that well

177
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,695
Sometimes I want to find out

178
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,622
But don't want to be nosy

179
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,594
If he stops playing, it'll be hell

180
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,836
Is it you?

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,771
It must be you!

182
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:45,384
I don't play... sax

183
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,684
Then who could it be?

184
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,554
It's a call...

185
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,025
from far away

186
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,363
Who talks about his love distress

187
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,899
I feel great for him now

188
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,361
Wish he could stay...

189
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,469
with his beloved one...

190
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,266
Forever and ever

191
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,233
If you want...

192
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,773
to share your problem with us

193
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,206
Give me a call

194
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,710
Let's chat in the air

195
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,910
Hoping that you can be relieved...

196
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,017
From any distress and problem

197
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,612
I can play sax since small

198
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,882
My father plays in the Taiwan Orchestra

199
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,722
I played sax with him together

200
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,127
I had performance in blind school too

201
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,058
Ever since Autumn says she likes sax,

202
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,967
I often play for her at night

203
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,601
Don't want her to know it's me

204
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,700
Even Dr. Woo can't attract her

205
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,738
Not to...

206
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,537
mention me

207
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,776
Better not screw up her dream

208
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,247
Or she might stop...

209
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,851
cutting my hair

210
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,788
Good morning, Onion!

211
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,954
Got to go, I'm late. Bye!

212
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,375
Is it good?

213
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,975
You are the first one to say that

214
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,518
Weird! Why they don't like it?

215
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,649
I know, you are always on my side

216
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,115
Did you hear it?

217
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,651
The sax

218
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,657
I just said I felt bad yesterday,

219
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,230
and it comes

220
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,831
It happens every time!

221
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,936
Meteor!

222
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,672
Did you see it? A meteor!

223
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,806
I forgot

224
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,879
How could you see it

225
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,249
But I've made two wishes

226
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,683
Is it too greedy?

227
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,078
Tell you?

228
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,353
Okay, it's about you anyway

229
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,354
The first one: your eyes recover soon

230
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,763
And watch the meteor shower with us

231
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,798
What do you think?

232
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,966
The second one?

233
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,465
Okay, I'll tell you

234
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,009
The second one is...

235
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,273
I won't tell you

236
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,308
No pouting!

237
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,509
No rubbing nose!

238
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,246
Do you know how it's like?

239
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,715
No. I'll tell you

240
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,653
It's like fireworks in the sky

241
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,002
Did I see it?

242
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,029
No

243
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,273
I'm lying?

244
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:08,345
If you see a meteor gliding across

245
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,007
What wishes would you make?

246
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,977
You have two also?

247
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:22,657
I know,

248
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,389
all the blind people recover

249
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,465
How great!

250
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,167
And the second one?

251
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,900
Come on, say it

252
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,877
Come on. It tickles

253
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,208
What's the second one?

254
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,149
Wait!

255
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,047
I've got paged. Wait for me

256
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,089
Move, move... Right...

257
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,870
Turn right, right...

258
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,531
Straight down, get move

259
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,666
No, no, back up, back up...

260
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,306
Move on, I'm late!

261
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,447
Oh, my god! It'll hit!

262
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,778
Straight down

263
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,446
Getting off ahead, thank you

264
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,346
Thanks, Onion

265
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,532
"Wait for me"

266
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,219
You look great, Onion

267
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,789
Got to go. Bye

268
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,670
What's up? You look happy

269
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,057
Oh, shit!

270
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:39,757
Call the cop!

271
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,017
I can see. Where is it?

272
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,184
Mr. Young, please queue here

273
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,093
This way

274
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,233
What? It's my friend. Bothers you?

275
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,584
Jackpot? You are the sixty billion human

276
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,093
traveling from the Earth...

277
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,628
to the Polaris

278
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,089
Jackpot? Am I dreaming?

279
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,834
You are not

280
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,729
This is the station to the Polaris

281
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,974
He knows what I'm thinking? Weird dream!

282
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,303
It's not a dream

283
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,639
You can see me, right?

284
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,578
You can speak. Speak

285
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,381
Really!

286
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,788
You don't remember?

287
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,926
You were dead. An accident

288
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,922
When one die, he leaves Planet Earth

289
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,023
to the Polaris

290
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,400
to continue his journey of life

291
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,501
One in a ten billion will...

292
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,031
hit the jackpot and get a wish

293
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,141
What's yours?

294
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,603
Go back. I don't want to die now!

295
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,814
I knew it

296
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,417
All five of the ten-billion did

297
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,854
But I can't make you alive

298
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,921
You can go back. You have five days

299
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,829
Better than none

300
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,356
Listen up

301
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,599
In five days, you are like you

302
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,761
But people won't...

303
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,395
know you

304
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,140
Because you borrow...

305
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,264
other's body

306
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,603
They won't recognize you

307
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,278
One more rule

308
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,108
You can't...

309
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,182
tell anyone

310
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,479
Nothing about your past identity

311
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,945
Even if you want to...

312
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,320
You can't

313
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,226
Can I...

314
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,756
see and speak?

315
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,031
Yes. Sure you want this?

316
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,492
The five before you

317
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,666
Came back regretting

318
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,966
No, I won't

319
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,299
Just let me see her

320
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,078
I can't

321
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,702
just remember her voice and smell

322
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,744
I can see her every looks and movements

323
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,877
Then, no matter how,

324
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,419
I'll be fine

325
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,055
With her,

326
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,320
I know what is real happiness

327
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,624
When could I go?

328
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:56,958
Anytime

329
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,485
Thank you

330
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,460
Thank you, for talking to me

331
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,402
Even angels get bored here

332
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,204
Are you nut?

333
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,133
Told you not to talk...

334
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:18,766
to strangers

335
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,571
Wait till someone abduct you

336
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,587
Are you alright?

337
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,918
I'm fine

338
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,855
People won't...

339
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,392
recognize you

340
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,253
Are you sure?

341
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,331
Yeah, I'm fine

342
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,760
Wong, you've been drinking again

343
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,864
Smells all alcohol

344
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,167
Is Ophthalmology Section on 1st floor?

345
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,847
Miss Chow?

346
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,292
You smells good. You must be Chow!

347
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,960
Who are you? Can I help you?

348
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,795
Where is...

349
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,167
Miss Autumn?

350
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,300
Down at the bus stop

351
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,964
She's going to her friend's funeral

352
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:24,567
Who?

353
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,642
What?

354
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,337
I mean...

355
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,311
I lived around. Maybe I know him

356
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,150
His name is Onion

357
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,585
Onion? My...

358
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,846
What date is it?

359
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,314
14th November

360
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,683
I've been away for ten days!

361
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,658
Are you alright?

362
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,023
I'm fine, thanks

363
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:45,956
Miss Chow...

364
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:46,996
What now?

365
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,063
I just want to say...

366
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,526
You look good in uniform

367
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,436
I know

368
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,472
- Is it to the grave-yard?
- Yes

369
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,654
Thank you, Miss Lam

370
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,156
Miss Chow

371
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,555
Joe!

372
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,596
Joe Chan, Miss Chan!

373
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,578
Wait, Autumn's not in yet

374
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,646
She went early. Don't you know?

375
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,109
This must be her. She's beautiful!

376
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,015
Gone

377
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,246
This belongs to Dr. Woo

378
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,487
What?! Excuse me!

379
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,825
What's up?

380
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,658
You're so upset. Are you close to him?

381
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,165
It's your foot. Ouch!

382
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,496
Not a word?

383
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,774
Sorry, I am sorry

384
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,577
It's alright. What's your name?

385
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,381
My name? Whatever

386
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,280
Watever, are you a close friend?

387
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,878
He and me...

388
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,621
That's Onion?

389
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,056
You don't know him?

390
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,791
I do! Haven't see him for a long time

391
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,269
Do you have a mirror?

392
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,702
Yes, hang on

393
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,207
Do we look alike?

394
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,643
No

395
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,884
Is he better looking?

396
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,248
You are

397
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:29,524
Wow, good looking

398
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,657
Nobody ever said that to me. Thanks

399
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,362
You're welcome

400
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,414
Jumboball, I miss you!

401
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,424
What the hell? You walk like ghost!

402
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,723
Do I know you?!

403
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,692
You don't, but I do

404
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,394
I'm Onion's friend

405
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,259
Onion?

406
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,405
His friends are...

407
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,872
my friends

408
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,308
Why I never met you?

409
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,710
I'm his old friend,

410
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,072
from Taiwan

411
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,142
Taiwan?

412
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,450
Classmate?

413
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,320
Why didn't you attend his funeral?

414
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,324
Forget it

415
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,124
I can't help crying. Better not go

416
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,661
Fine. What else do you want?

417
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,627
Just to stay a little longer

418
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,302
Shut the door

419
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,664
when you go

420
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,039
Thanks

421
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:37,943
Insurance broker, Cheuk

422
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,690
May I have Mr. Cheuk?

423
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,735
He's out. I'm Siu

424
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,962
May I help you?

425
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,600
If I buy insurance...

426
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:03,841
And die,

427
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,504
will you indemnify the beneficiary?

428
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,440
Of course

429
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,376
How much is the indemnity?

430
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,482
Depends on how much you buy

431
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,605
Do you want to buy?

432
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,444
I have time. We can sit down...

433
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,315
Have a cup of tea, and talk

434
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,719
I just want the indemnity

435
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,622
Because I... My friend...

436
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,426
Who bought insurance...

437
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,121
from you died

438
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,626
Died? Mr. Cheuk's on leave

439
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,735
Call again some other days

440
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,733
Bye

441
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,499
You said you had time. Can we...?

442
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,270
Some other days...

443
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,442
I don't have much other days

444
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,378
Onion!

445
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,275
Are you here?

446
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,517
From now on, I'll take care of you

447
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,702
My name's Cheuk. My name card

448
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,265
Actually, I'm Onion

449
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,341
My name's Cheuk. My name card

450
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,948
My name's Cheuk. My name card...

451
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,352
You!...

452
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:08,889
Who are you?

453
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,261
My name's Cheuk. My name card

454
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,068
Sir?

455
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,266
Salty Lemon Seven, thanks

456
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:24,966
Salty Lemon Seven, boss

457
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,308
I'll add the salt myself

458
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,398
Mr. Cheuk

459
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,770
Not many people come for me

460
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,134
Most we know

461
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,541
That is nurses' dormitory

462
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,433
Water, Miss Autumn

463
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:01,704
- Thanks
- What do you have?

464
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,514
So much I wanted to tell her

465
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,245
Looking at her now,

466
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,318
I can't say a word

467
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,416
Mr. Cheuk

468
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,387
How can I help you?

469
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,025
Yes

470
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,121
Your friend Young, Onion...

471
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,932
...bought an insurance from us

472
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,831
And Autumn Yue is the beneficiary

473
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,560
Are you Autumn Yue?

474
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,698
Strange friend, huh?

475
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,739
Funny nickname...

476
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,035
You think it's funny?

477
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,474
Just a few questions for the indemnity

478
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,882
Your career is...

479
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,353
Nurse trainee

480
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,220
How long do you know each other?

481
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,417
One year and 26 days

482
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,088
Wow, you even remember the 26 days

483
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:54,794
What's your relationship?

484
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,997
I mean,

485
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,494
friendship?

486
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,730
Common, intimate, lovers?

487
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:02,995
Why should I tell you?

488
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,936
Because that's very important

489
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,572
If you are intimate

490
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,806
or lovers

491
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,182
He might kill himself

492
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,484
to leave you the best

493
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,875
He won't kill himself!

494
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,115
He won't!

495
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,186
He's tough,

496
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,984
full of life and hope!

497
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,692
Go on, go on

498
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:30,061
What's your relationship with Dr. Woo?

499
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,424
Whom do you like more?

500
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,503
Are you really Insurance Actuary?

501
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,735
Does it matter which one like?

502
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,000
Because... because probably...

503
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,204
You two killed Onion...

504
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,907
My God! What did I say?

505
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,647
Am I a jealous nut?

506
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,287
Mr. Cheuk,

507
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,521
you are the worst man I know

508
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,488
The lowest, the most caddish pest!

509
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,120
Autumn!

510
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,488
I...

511
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,991
Fisherman, the towel!

512
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,503
Do you have epilepsy?

513
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,012
You better have a check-up

514
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,625
God!

515
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,626
You can't tell your real identity

516
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,464
Even if you want to, you can't

517
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,559
I felt...

518
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,897
like you're here

519
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,997
So I could really yell at him

520
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,185
Sorry about what happened

521
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,487
Don't know how to explain

522
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,859
I am Onion, and Cheuk

523
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,857
It's sounds ridiculous,

524
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,221
but it's true

525
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,959
We don't disappear when we die

526
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,662
We live in another place

527
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,737
Remember...

528
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,034
you cut my hair 13 times?

529
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,478
Even cut my ear once

530
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,577
You asked me if it hurt

531
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,580
To be safe,

532
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,715
I'll record again

533
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,053
I am Onion, and Cheuk

534
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,156
Believe me

535
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,727
I know it's ridiculous

536
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,788
Remember the night before I died...

537
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,000
You saw meteor and

538
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,967
made wishes...

539
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,870
For me? Thanks

540
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,612
I am off at ten. Let's have dinner

541
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,676
I can't...

542
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,641
How about midnight snacks?

543
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,148
No trouble?

544
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,217
No

545
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,150
Really, I'm fine now

546
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,882
Could you have the flowers back?

547
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,417
Cheapskate!

548
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,151
How could you take it back?

549
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:10,988
You gave it to me!

550
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,661
Did I say that?

551
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,064
See!

552
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,132
You want it? Take it!

553
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:45,953
Sorry

554
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,090
I know it's for Autumn

555
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,963
In graveyard, your look's obvious

556
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,100
She has a day off, though

557
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,933
It's broken. I think she won't mind

558
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,111
Take it

559
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,114
Pity me?

560
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,846
For you, really

561
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,557
I get it, thanks

562
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,729
I feel great. Hope you are the same

563
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:20,956
You will see her

564
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,199
She's in her sister's. The address...

565
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,529
I know, she told me before

566
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,300
Thanks

567
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,747
You alright?

568
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,874
Why learn swimming suddenly?

569
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,080
You used to yell

570
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,449
when I washed you hair...

571
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,387
...and pushed your head down

572
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:49,920
Scared of water and

573
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,494
never dare do anything

574
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,662
Till it's too late

575
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,790
The more I scare,

576
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,591
the better I'll try now

577
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,437
Let me get a notebook

578
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,169
So deep,

579
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,775
got to jot it down

580
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,370
You're teasing me!

581
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,079
- Come on, take it
- Thanks, sis

582
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:11,910
You like someone

583
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,210
but dare not say it

584
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,586
And it's too late. Am I right?

585
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,688
Think I won't splash you

586
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:20,688
cause you're pregnant?

587
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,720
Don't you need help?

588
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,659
Here we are

589
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,693
No parking ahead. Can't go in

590
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:34,666
Three hundreds!

591
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,003
How far ahead?

592
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,602
Not far. Take this way

593
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,653
What's up?

594
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,453
Can I ask you...

595
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,962
What happen to my little sister who...

596
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,067
...used to be so strong?

597
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,296
Thanks for the compliments. I'm fine

598
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:11,870
Okay

599
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,735
Strong. Is it a compliment?

600
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,638
I thought it meant bad tempered

601
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,319
Come when you want to talk

602
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,852
Let me... stay still, Your Majesty

603
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,859
Just treat me as Queen later

604
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,658
Dr. Woo?

605
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,133
Good guess! You are here

606
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,270
I am just dropping by

607
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,703
and see if you're here

608
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,365
And you are

609
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,769
Drop by?

610
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,042
It takes at least two-hour to come here

611
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,546
Where were you?

612
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,848
Here, it's near... the airport!

613
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,379
I went to see somebody off...

614
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,251
So I drop by

615
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,087
Hungry?

616
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,592
You bought so much food to the airport?

617
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,832
Well, it's cheap there. So...

618
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,962
Never mind

619
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,558
My sister

620
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,669
Actually I come for you

621
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,998
I worry if you are alright,

622
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,132
so...

623
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,305
I bought all these nutriment...

624
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,074
for you

625
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,411
I'll go after I leave them here

626
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,882
You're so nice. Come on in

627
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,080
You're like...

628
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:33,918
door-keeping gods

629
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:34,854
This is Dr. Woo

630
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,084
- How are you?
- Fine, how are you?

631
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,216
How are you, baby?

632
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,595
Doing butterfly stroke every day

633
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,665
Bang, bang, bang. Drive you nut

634
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:43,797
You are really nice

635
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,068
We live so far away and you still come

636
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,267
Just drop by

637
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,533
Stay for dinner, then

638
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,605
Sure

639
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,902
My sis needs to talk to someone

640
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,039
Let me help. It's heavy

641
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,174
Are you sure?

642
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,017
Isn't it a bit impulsive?

643
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,886
You should have...

644
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,291
known before

645
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:14,386
Years ago

646
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,931
when my first patient died,

647
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,556
I thought the same way

648
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,198
Then I told myself:

649
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,836
Many things are out of my control

650
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,298
If you give up

651
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,070
Then you shouldn't ever start

652
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,012
Sis

653
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,379
Are you hot, or just doing facial?

654
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:38,913
Just getting to the point

655
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,924
She's quite funny

656
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,956
Yes. She's more simple

657
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,592
How about you?

658
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,759
I know what you mean

659
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,401
The seniors say

660
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,632
when you see patients die,

661
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,868
Go see the new-born and

662
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,443
you'll feel better

663
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,540
But he's not just any patients

664
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,150
He's Onion

665
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:12,787
You won't understand

666
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,015
I didn't believe it before

667
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,058
Until it happens...

668
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,559
to you

669
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,992
I can't go on

670
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,395
Let it out, you'll feel better

671
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,468
Don't worry

672
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,338
I won't just go

673
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,974
I'll stay till the end of this month

674
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,946
Help the new comer...

675
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,215
get used to things

676
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,286
I need time

677
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,783
Give me time

678
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,087
I can change your mind

679
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:51,724
Thank you

680
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,919
I feel much better now

681
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,357
Coming, coming

682
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:00,732
Who do you want?

683
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,176
My sister?

684
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,551
What a crowd today

685
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,614
So...

686
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,190
many people coming

687
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,949
Are you dropping by too?

688
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,596
No, I come for her

689
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,626
I have to talk to you

690
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:29,830
Really?

691
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,130
I called you

692
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,530
They said you were on leave

693
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,294
Sorry about last time

694
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,003
I want my indemnity

695
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,675
I won't reject anything from Onion

696
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,403
Fine, but...

697
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,774
You are insurance broker?

698
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:44,610
My last name's Cheuk

699
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,179
Mr. Cheuk

700
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,343
It's getting more and more complex
