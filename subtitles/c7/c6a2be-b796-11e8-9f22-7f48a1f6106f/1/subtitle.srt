1
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,943
In the last century, before the birth
of the new faith called Christianity,

2
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,044
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of Rome

3
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,419
and bring about a new society,

4
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:05,620
the Roman Republic stood at the
very center of the civilized world.

5
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:09,193
"Of all things fairest,"
sang the poet,

6
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:13,724
"first among cities and home
of the gods is golden Rome. "

7
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:16,498
Yet, even at the zenith
of her pride and power

8
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:19,632
the Republic lay fatally
stricken with a disease

9
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,676
called human slavery.

10
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:24,837
The age of the dictator
was at hand

11
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:28,372
waiting in the shadows for
the event to bring it forth.

12
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,151
In that same century,

13
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,950
in the conquered
Greek province of Thrace,

14
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:37,424
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master's wealth

15
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:41,793
by giving birth to a son
whom she named Spartacus.

16
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:44,264
A proud, rebellious son

17
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:47,495
who was sold to living death
in the mines of Libya

18
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,901
before
his thirteenth birthday.

19
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,133
There, under whip
and chain and sun,

20
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,201
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood,

21
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,509
dreaming the death of slavery

22
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,949
2,··· years before
it finally would die.

23
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:47,318
Back to work!

24
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:49,720
Back to work!

25
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:58,101
Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

26
00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:01,006
Come on, get up!
Get up! Get...

27
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:04,235
Oh, my ankle!
My ankle!

28
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:07,409
My ankle!

29
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:12,651
Guard! Guard!

30
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:19,486
Spartacus again, huh?
Well, this time he dies.

31
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,721
Move along!
Back to work, all of you!

32
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:43,976
Welcome,
Lentulus Batiatus.

33
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:45,884
Welcome, indeed,
my dear Captain.

34
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,593
Oh, 11 miles through
this disastrous heat

35
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:57,530
and the cost of hiring
an escort, ruinous.

36
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,429
Even so, I warrant you have
nothing fit to sell me,

37
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,834
have you, Captain?

38
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:05,339
I've wasted both
my time and my money.

39
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:06,601
Tell me the truth.

40
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:09,143
We have a few
you might be interested in.

41
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,873
These? Carrion.

42
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:13,938
The buzzards are late.

43
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,541
This one's not bad.
He's a Gaul.

44
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:19,144
I don't like Gauls.
Hairy.

45
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,050
Can he come down
unassisted?

46
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:24,592
Come down,
you.

47
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:26,892
Come down!

48
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,192
Be good enough
to show me the teeth.

49
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,668
Open your mouth.

50
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,102
Thank you.

51
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,506
Yes, as the teeth go,
so go the bones.

52
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,571
This mouth
is really impermissible.

53
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,013
The fellow's
made of chalk.

54
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,210
We have
many others.

55
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:59,353
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

56
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,658
Who's that?

57
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,528
This one's a
Thracian.

58
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,998
I'm making an example
of him.

59
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,159
How?

60
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:08,600
Starve him to death.

61
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,537
It's the only thing
that impresses slaves.

62
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,233
What a pity.

63
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:18,642
He reacts.
Good muscle tone.

64
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:21,978
Can I see
his teeth?

65
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,177
Open your mouth,
Spartacus.

66
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,852
You smell
like a rhinoceros.

67
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,692
Captain, the teeth. You
asked him to open his mouth.

68
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,319
He doesn't
obey you?

69
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:36,364
His teeth are
the best thing about him.

70
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,832
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

71
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,803
Marvelous. I wish I'd
been here. I'll take him.

72
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:44,839
Let's look
at some of the others.

73
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,212
Come along.

74
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:57,106
In spite of
sickness and death,

75
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:59,306
we will profit
11,000 sesterces.

76
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:02,313
Including your commission,
of course.

77
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,410
Oh, no, sir.
Without my commission.

78
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,656
Marcellus,
there they are.

79
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,194
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

80
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:16,196
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

81
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,862
Slaves,

82
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:27,067
you have arrived at the gladiatorial
school of Lentulus Batiatus.

83
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:29,133
You'll be trained
by experts

84
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,008
to fight in pairs
to the death.

85
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,276
You won't fight
to the death here.

86
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:36,317
That will be
after you've been sold

87
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:38,352
and then for ladies
and gentlemen of quality,

88
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,048
for those who appreciate
a fine kill.

89
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,689
A gladiator's like a stallion,
he must be pampered.

90
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,054
You'll be oiled, bathed,

91
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,259
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

92
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:57,366
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself.

93
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,532
You'll be given
your ceremonial caudas.

94
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,701
Marcellus, please.
There.

95
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,639
Be proud of them.

96
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:08,672
On special occasions,
those who please me

97
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,277
will even be given the
companionship of a young lady.

98
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:16,156
Approximately
half our graduates

99
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:19,660
live for five, 10,
10 years.

100
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:24,123
Some even attain freedom and
become trainers themselves.

101
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:25,757
Marcellus.

102
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,034
I congratulate you.

103
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:31,072
And may fortune smile
on most of you.

104
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:39,211
Marcellus, watch the second
from the right.

105
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,375
He's a Thracian. They were going to
kill him for hamstringing a guard.

106
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,508
We'll break him of that.

107
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:46,053
Don't overdo it.
He has quality.

108
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,953
Next.

109
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:02,127
Next.

110
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:11,176
I like you.

111
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,907
I want you
to be my friend.

112
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,342
I want to be
your friend.

113
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:22,180
All I ask is that
you get along with me.

114
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,727
What's your name,
slave?

115
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,060
Spartacus.

116
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:32,923
I feel
you don't like me.

117
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,137
Give him your sword.

118
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:45,974
Take it!

119
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,148
I have a feeling
you want to kill me.

120
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,488
This is the only chance
you'll ever get.

121
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,157
Kill me.

122
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,531
Don't be afraid,
slave.

123
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,031
You have
that sword.

124
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,868
I only have
this piece of wood.

125
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,902
Are you
going to disobey me?

126
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,173
Take his sword.

127
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:26,312
You're not as stupid
as I thought.

128
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:28,617
You might even
be intelligent.

129
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,917
That's dangerous for slaves.

130
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,494
You just remember,

131
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,761
from now on everything
you do I'll be watching.

132
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,698
You did
the right thing.

133
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,361
Every once in a while Marcellus
likes to kill a man as an example.

134
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:19,298
I think he's picked you.
Better watch him.

135
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:24,744
How long
have you been here?

136
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,109
Six months.

137
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,012
I wish
he'd pick me.

138
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:31,382
I want one chance at that
pig before they carry me out!

139
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:33,648
Quiet!
No talking down there.

140
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:38,954
Dionysius, you'll get us in
trouble just like in the mines.

141
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:46,326
What's your name?

142
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:49,666
You don't want to know
my name.

143
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:52,202
I don't want to know
your name.

144
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:55,198
Just
a friendly question.

145
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,573
Gladiators
don't make friends.

146
00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:00,680
If we're ever matched
in the arena together,

147
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,614
I'll have to
kill you.

148
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:32,573
Helena

149
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:36,215
with Galino.

150
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,984
Patricia,

151
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:45,453
Crixus.

152
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:49,760
Priscilla,

153
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,694
David.

154
00:19:58,272 --> 00:19:59,501
Claudia,

155
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,069
Pharox.

156
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:08,411
Varinia,

157
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,947
Dionysius.

158
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,611
No, no.
Spartacus.

159
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,121
Spartacus.

160
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:22,457
Felicia...

161
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,200
I've never
had a woman.

162
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:02,963
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.

163
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,260
Go away.
What will she think of you?

164
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:06,925
Indeed,
what will I think of you?

165
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,525
Go away.

166
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:11,362
Come, come.
Be generous.

167
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,168
We must learn
to share our pleasures.

168
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,076
I'm not an animal!

169
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:21,445
You're not trying to escape,
by any chance?

170
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:24,417
Direct your courage
to the girl, Spartacus.

171
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,919
I'm not an animal!

172
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,758
I'm not an animal.

173
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:38,321
Neither am I.

174
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:17,064
What's your name?

175
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,969
Varinia.

176
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:26,143
You'll have to take her
out of here, Marcellus.

177
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:27,840
You may not be an animal,
Spartacus,

178
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:32,250
but this sorry show gives me little
hope that you'll ever be a man.

179
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:22,553
First rule, you get
an instant kill on the red.

180
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,263
Here, here.

181
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,166
Always remember,
go for the red first.

182
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,863
If you don't,
your opponent will.

183
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:34,305
In the blue,
you get a cripple.

184
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,833
Here, here,

185
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,846
here and here.

186
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:42,014
Second rule,

187
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,014
go for the cripple
before the slow kill.

188
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,920
Here's a slow kill
on the yellow.

189
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,089
Here, here
and here.

190
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,292
Remember,

191
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:56,594
a slow kill may have
enough left in him

192
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:58,359
to kill you
before he dies.

193
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,433
With a cripple,
you know you've got him

194
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,492
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

195
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,471
The rest is all right for
a public spectacle in Rome,

196
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,734
but here at Capua

197
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:08,673
we expect more
than simple butchery

198
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,233
and we get it.

199
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:15,648
Spartacus, why are you
looking at that girl?

200
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,043
Varinia! Stand still.

201
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,693
Since all you can do
is look at girls,

202
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:31,696
all right, slave,
go ahead and look.

203
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:34,860
I said, look.

204
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:19,877
No. No, this one goes
to the Spaniard.

205
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,680
Have a good night's rest,
Spartacus.

206
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,593
In there.

207
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,235
Woman!

208
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:27,344
I've warned you
about this kind of thing.

209
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,743
All right,
bring them in.

210
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:56,541
No talking!
Move along.

211
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,168
Did they hurt you?

212
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:09,072
No.

213
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:54,188
That's a kill.

214
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:56,525
One, two,

215
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:59,998
three, four, five.

216
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,297
One, two,

217
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,360
three, four...

218
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,653
We have visitors,
tremendous visitors.

219
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:05,858
Two simply enormous
Roman lords on the hill.

220
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:07,901
How easily impressed
you are, Ramon.

221
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,198
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

222
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,261
Tell them to wait
for me when they arrive.

223
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,704
Master,
you don't understand...

224
00:32:13,774 --> 00:32:16,140
How enormous
do these Roman lords get?

225
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:19,077
One of them
is Marcus Licinius Crassus.

226
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,807
What?
Wait a minute.

227
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:24,408
Crassus here? My red
toga with the acorns.

228
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,919
Chairs in the atrium.
Second-best wine.

229
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,286
No, the best,
but small goblets.

230
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:33,224
Gracchus. You know
how Crassus loathes him.

231
00:32:34,094 --> 00:32:35,653
Take him away.

232
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:37,356
I can't lift it.

233
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:39,991
Use your imagination.
Cover him.

234
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,592
Tell Marcellus
to get the men ready.

235
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,138
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show.

236
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:46,730
Forgive me, Gracchus.

237
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,491
Marcus
Licinius Crassus.

238
00:33:14,568 --> 00:33:16,331
Most noble
radiance,

239
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:18,895
first general
of the Republic,

240
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:22,806
father and defender
of Rome, honor my house.

241
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,901
Bless it
with your presence.

242
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,382
Wine, sweetmeats!

243
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:38,652
Can't you see that
Their Honors are exhausted?

244
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:44,120
Have the goodness
to sit.

245
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:51,903
Is anything wrong,
Your Nobility?

246
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:53,797
No.

247
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:58,408
Welcome to the
Lady Claudia Maria,

248
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:01,778
former wife of
Lucius Caius Marius

249
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:05,307
whose recent execution
touched us all deeply.

250
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,484
Honor
to the Lady Helena,

251
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:10,785
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus,

252
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:14,350
whose fame shall live on
forever in the person of his son,

253
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,952
your brother,

254
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:19,295
Marcus
Publius Glabrus,

255
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,759
hero
of the Eastern War.

256
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:23,564
How very much
he knows.

257
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:27,001
Allow me to bring
you up-to-date.

258
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:30,510
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

259
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:33,342
A mating of eagles,
Your Sanctity.

260
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,074
Fan His Magnitude.
He sweats.

261
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:36,377
No, no.
No, no.

262
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,112
My young friends desire a
private showing of two pairs.

263
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:40,915
Two pairs?

264
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:44,480
Oh, yes. I have something
that would please them.

265
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,219
Two pairs
to the death.

266
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,819
To the death,
Your Ladyship?

267
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:51,387
Surely you don't think
we came all the way to Capua

268
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,332
for gymnastics?

269
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:56,528
But I beg,
Your Honors,

270
00:34:56,603 --> 00:35:00,267
we train the finest
gladiators in all Italy.

271
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,206
We can give you
a display of swordsmanship

272
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:05,108
which is better than
you can see in Rome.

273
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:06,908
When they're sold,
their new masters

274
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,345
may do with them
as they wish.

275
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:12,283
But here, no, we never
fight them to the death.

276
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:13,820
Crassus.

277
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:16,652
Today is
an exception.

278
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,316
But the ill feeling,

279
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,587
it would spread
through the whole school.

280
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,857
Then the cost.
Oh, the cost.

281
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,557
Name your price.

282
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:30,399
25,000 sesterces.

283
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:32,736
Arrange it.

284
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:35,905
Are you serious,
sir?

285
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:39,978
Arrange it
immediately.

286
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:43,444
Of course, we shall want
to choose them ourselves.

287
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,884
You do have
a certain variety?

288
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:48,250
Inexhaustible.

289
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:59,395
Spartacus, there's going to be
a fight to the death.

290
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,326
To the death?
How do you know?

291
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:03,768
I heard Marcellus
tell one of his guards.

292
00:36:03,837 --> 00:36:05,862
Who fights?
I don't know.

293
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:10,310
To the death.

294
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:15,846
What if they matched
you and me?

295
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,911
They won't.

296
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,612
What if they did?

297
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:22,947
Would you fight?

298
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:27,585
I'd have to.
So would you.

299
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:30,653
Would you try
to kill me?

300
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,056
Yes, I'd kill.

301
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,868
I'd try to stay...

302
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:39,929
I'd try to stay alive,
and so would you.

303
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:43,067
All gladiators
up to the training area.

304
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:45,543
Some visitors
want to admire you.

305
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:52,485
Form a line in front of me.

306
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:54,213
Would Your Excellencies

307
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,551
care to make
your selection now?

308
00:36:58,558 --> 00:36:59,787
Claudia.

309
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,495
Oh, they're
magnificent.

310
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:13,835
For you,
Lady Helena,

311
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:16,433
may I suggest
Praxus?

312
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,106
A veritable tiger.

313
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:22,842
I don't like him.

314
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,722
I prefer that one.

315
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,690
Which one?
No, no.

316
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:34,887
David?

317
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,453
Oh, Crixus, yes.

318
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:40,897
Ah, Marcellus,
Crixus for the short sword.

319
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:48,964
Have you ever seen such a
pair of shoulders? Dionysius.

320
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,277
I admit he's small,

321
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:53,506
but he's very compact
and extremely strong.

322
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,446
In fact, he looks...

323
00:37:55,515 --> 00:37:59,213
He looks smaller here
than he does in the arena.

324
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:02,516
Optical.

325
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,784
Give me that one.

326
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:09,657
Oh, Galino.
Yes, yes. Galino.

327
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,595
You have a shrewd eye,
Your Pulchritude,

328
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,792
if I may permit
myself the...

329
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:15,391
Galino.

330
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,732
Practically every man
in this school

331
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:19,329
is an expert
with a Thracian sword

332
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:23,399
but the trident is something
very rare these days.

333
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:27,606
May I suggest
the Ethiopian?

334
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,119
There are very few
Ethiopians in the country.

335
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:37,218
Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

336
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,454
I'll take him.

337
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,398
Draba? Oh, no.
For you I want the best.

338
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:52,461
I do think the Ethiopian...
I want the most beautiful.

339
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,700
I'll take
the big black one.

340
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:57,903
Draba.

341
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:02,782
Only one man in the entire
school stands a chance

342
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:06,342
with the Thracian knife
against the trident.

343
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:07,944
There.

344
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,318
Over there,
Lady Helena.

345
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,949
He's impertinent.

346
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:14,355
I'll take him.

347
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:18,557
And he's a coward to boot.
Have him flogged.

348
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:22,635
Over there, Lady Helena.
The beast of Libya.

349
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,634
I prefer
the coward.

350
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:30,734
Spartacus.

351
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,838
If both men are down and refuse to fight
your trainer will slit their throats.

352
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,314
We want no tricks.

353
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:38,715
Tricks, madam?
At the school of Batiatus?

354
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:42,244
You heard the instruction,
Marcellus? Remember it.

355
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,116
I feel sorry for the
poor things in this heat.

356
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:48,752
Don't put them in those
suffocating tunics.

357
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:51,456
Let them wear just
enough for modesty.

358
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:54,728
Whatever they wear, Lady,
they'll bless your name.

359
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,835
Back, the rest of you.

360
00:39:58,371 --> 00:40:00,032
Our choosing
has bored you?

361
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,508
No, most exciting.
I tingle.

362
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,604
Do let's get out
of the sun.

363
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:09,376
May I conduct Your
Magnificences to the gallery?

364
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:24,020
An eavesdropper.
Oh, the gods.

365
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:29,163
How far from Rome must I go
to avoid that cunning face?

366
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:32,831
Don't talk about
Gracchus. He's so hateful.

367
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:35,670
For Gracchus, hatred of the
patrician class is a profession

368
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:37,471
and not such
a bad one, either.

369
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:39,034
How else
can one become

370
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:42,207
master of the mob
and first senator of Rome?

371
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:44,580
Crassus,
it's so boring.

372
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,320
I believe that girl
smells of perfume.

373
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:56,294
Whatever it is,
she smells most delectable.

374
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:59,798
You can't keep slaves from
stealing unless you chain them.

375
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:02,961
When a slave's as pretty as she
is, she doesn't have to steal.

376
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:05,835
An arrangement is made.

377
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:08,306
If her ankles
are good,

378
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:11,242
you can be sure
an arrangement was made.

379
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,007
Oh, master!

380
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,549
A catastrophe.

381
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:18,277
I've been anointed.

382
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,786
Why, you trollop!
You did that on purpose.

383
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,049
It was an accident.
Come here, girl.

384
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,958
Don't be frightened.

385
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,426
What country
are you from?

386
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:33,727
Britannia.

387
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:37,533
How long
have you been a slave?

388
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:41,297
Since I was 13.

389
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:45,609
You have
a certain education.

390
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:48,773
My first master had me
tutored for his children.

391
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:57,718
I like her.
She has spirit.

392
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,256
I'll buy her.

393
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:01,817
Buy her,
Your Magnificence?

394
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,295
I have spent quite
a lot of money on her.

395
00:42:04,364 --> 00:42:06,628
I've no doubt of it.
2,000 sesterces.

396
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:09,134
She'll be waiting
at your litter.

397
00:42:09,202 --> 00:42:12,194
No, I don't want her
feet spoiled by walking.

398
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,239
Send her to Rome with your steward
the next time he has to go there.

399
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:18,903
He leaves tomorrow,
and the girl with him.

400
00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:21,504
More wine,
and thank your gods.

401
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,513
You provoke me, Crassus. I
shan't be nice to you anymore.

402
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,109
Why distress me
so much?

403
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:30,554
You're horribly rich, yet you're
the only one of my brother's friends

404
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:33,354
who hasn't given him
a wedding present.

405
00:42:37,664 --> 00:42:40,565
I was saving it
for a more suitable moment.

406
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,927
Here.
Give it to him, child.

407
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:45,963
What is it?

408
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:50,374
As from this moment, your husband
is commander of the garrison of Rome.

409
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,542
Wonderful.

410
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,244
I don't know how I shall
ever be able to repay you.

411
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:01,514
Time will solve
that mystery.

412
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:05,120
The garrison of Rome.

413
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:06,386
Yes.

414
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,123
The only power in Rome strong enough
to checkmate Gracchus and his Senate.

415
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:11,755
You are clever.

416
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:25,173
Open up.

417
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:48,460
Through that door.

418
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:05,407
You will have to
watch him, Claudia.

419
00:44:05,485 --> 00:44:08,420
Father almost disinherited him
because of slave girls.

420
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:12,151
The marriage contract
absolutely forbids a harem.

421
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:14,819
What about
your litter bearers?

422
00:44:14,894 --> 00:44:19,525
Every one of them is under 20
and taller than they should be.

423
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,728
She sets rather
a high standard for you.

424
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:25,294
Your pleasure, Your Highness.

425
00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:27,129
To you, my dear,

426
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,642
shall go the honor of
starting this poetic drama.

427
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:35,541
Open up.

428
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:44,648
First pair!
Crixus and Galino!

429
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:05,870
Those who are about
to die salute you.

430
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,207
Crixus.

431
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:56,785
Next pair!

432
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:21,973
Those who are about
to die salute you.

433
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,737
Your Thracian's
doing well.

434
00:48:18,804 --> 00:48:22,297
How were you able to get my
appointment without Gracchus knowing?

435
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,241
I fought fire
with oil.

436
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,210
I purchased the Senate
behind his back.

437
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:28,747
I still think the
trident's going to win.

438
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:57,467
Why doesn't he kill him?

439
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,868
Kill him.

440
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,238
What's the matter now?

441
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:04,605
Kill him!
Kill him!

442
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:06,042
Kill him,
you imbecile!

443
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:07,602
Kill him!
Kill him!

444
00:51:55,454 --> 00:51:57,684
He'll hang there
till he rots.

445
00:53:32,051 --> 00:53:34,178
Take a last look,
Spartacus.

446
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:37,081
She's going to Rome.
She's been sold.

447
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,385
She's been sold?

448
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,463
No talking
in the kitchen, slave.

449
00:54:40,352 --> 00:54:41,581
There's trouble
in the mess hall.

450
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,986
They killed Marcellus
and maybe the other two.

451
00:54:44,056 --> 00:54:45,114
Call out the guard.

452
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,482
Move, move.

453
00:54:49,762 --> 00:54:53,164
On second thoughts, I'll
deliver the girl personally.

454
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,495
Ride to Capua. Call out the
garrison. I don't trust this lot.

455
00:54:56,568 --> 00:54:57,865
I hold you
responsible.

456
00:54:57,936 --> 00:54:58,995
Yes, sir.

457
00:57:54,279 --> 00:57:57,579
Around Capua,
they ravaged the countryside,

458
00:57:57,649 --> 00:58:00,084
forcing other slaves
to join them.

459
00:58:00,152 --> 00:58:03,850
Looting, robbing,
burning everything,

460
00:58:03,922 --> 00:58:05,720
while they make
their camp

461
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:08,590
in the escarpments
of Vesuvius.

462
00:58:09,561 --> 00:58:12,155
Each day
swells their numbers.

463
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:16,432
The situation lies
in the hands

464
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:18,333
of this august body.

465
00:58:21,473 --> 00:58:23,840
Where's
the mighty Crassus?

466
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,868
Out of the city.
At least, you're here.

467
00:58:26,945 --> 00:58:30,177
No need to fear for Rome
as long as Glabrus is with us.

468
00:58:30,249 --> 00:58:35,050
Let me add, over 100
estates have been burned.

469
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:37,918
Among them,
gentlemen, my own.

470
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:42,827
Burned to the ground
and 3 million sesterces lost.

471
00:58:43,495 --> 00:58:47,329
I propose the immediate recall of
Pompey and his legions from Spain.

472
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,697
I could raise 500 men
and bring the lot of them in.

473
00:58:49,768 --> 00:58:51,702
Don't make a fool
of yourself.

474
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:55,729
Why call back the legions

475
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:58,470
when the garrison of Rome
has nothing to do

476
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:01,069
but to defend us
from sausage makers?

477
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:05,179
Let's send Glabrus
against these scoundrels.

478
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,583
Give them a taste
of Roman steel.

479
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:13,791
I protest.
I most strongly protest.

480
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:16,191
There are more slaves
in Rome than Romans.

481
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,627
With the garrison absent,

482
00:59:17,696 --> 00:59:20,358
what's to prevent them
from rising, too?

483
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:23,798
I did not say
the whole garrison.

484
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:26,497
Six cohorts
will more than do the job.

485
00:59:26,638 --> 00:59:28,004
The rest can stay in Rome

486
00:59:28,073 --> 00:59:30,337
to save you
from your housemaids.

487
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:35,174
Will you accept
such a charge, Glabrus?

488
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:44,884
I accept the charge of the Senate,
if the Senate truly charges me.

489
00:59:46,058 --> 00:59:49,653
The garrison of Rome
stands ready.

490
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:56,865
Slave hunting's
a dirty business.

491
00:59:56,935 --> 00:59:58,960
It takes a brave commander
to consent to it.

492
00:59:59,037 --> 01:00:01,404
I propose we turn
the city out tomorrow

493
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,771
in tribute to Glabrus
as he marches through.

494
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:12,142
And for temporary command of
the garrison during his absence,

495
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:15,585
I propose
Caius Julius Caesar.

496
01:00:31,136 --> 01:00:35,437
You don't look very happy
over the new job.

497
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,476
It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.

498
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:39,738
Maybe.

499
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,877
At least
it gives me a chance

500
01:00:41,947 --> 01:00:45,246
to separate Glabrus
from Crassus for a while.

501
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,045
You know,

502
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,316
this Republic of ours is
something like a rich widow.

503
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:52,619
Most Romans
love her as their mother.

504
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,992
But Crassus dreams of marrying
the old girl, to put it politely.

505
01:00:57,229 --> 01:00:59,857
Hail Glabrus.
Hail Glabrus.

506
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:01,558
Hail Glabrus!

507
01:01:06,004 --> 01:01:07,972
God be with you,
Glabrus.

508
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,598
And with you,
too.

509
01:01:15,313 --> 01:01:18,340
I hope he returns
to such applause.

510
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,345
Oh, one fat one,
Fimbria.

511
01:01:27,325 --> 01:01:30,022
Keep the change.
Give it to your wife.

512
01:01:30,095 --> 01:01:31,494
May the gods
adore you.

513
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,032
Only through
your prayers.

514
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:38,468
Let's make an old-fashioned
sacrifice for Glabrus' success, hmm?

515
01:01:38,537 --> 01:01:40,801
I thought you had reservations
about the gods.

516
01:01:40,872 --> 01:01:43,273
Privately, I believe
in none. Neither do you.

517
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:45,003
Publicly,
I believe in them all.

518
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:47,568
Greetings,
Marcus Clodius Flavius!

519
01:02:17,175 --> 01:02:18,905
Is Marcus Glabrus
in attendance?

520
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:20,138
He awaits you
in the atrium, sir.

521
01:02:20,212 --> 01:02:21,975
Excellent.

522
01:02:24,382 --> 01:02:25,372
What have we here?

523
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,612
A gift from
the Governor of Sicily.

524
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:46,867
"Antoninus.
Sicilian, age 26,

525
01:02:48,173 --> 01:02:49,766
"singer of songs. "

526
01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:53,669
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

527
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:58,211
For the children of my master
whom I also taught the classics.

528
01:02:58,283 --> 01:03:00,251
Classics, indeed.

529
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,278
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

530
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,089
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.

531
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:11,152
All of you,
come with me.

532
01:03:25,977 --> 01:03:27,843
Are you on guard duty?

533
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:33,646
My dear Crassus,
congratulate me.

534
01:03:33,718 --> 01:03:36,813
Or better still, let us
congratulate each other.

535
01:03:37,956 --> 01:03:39,617
I congratulate us.

536
01:03:39,824 --> 01:03:44,353
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts of the
garrison against the slaves on Vesuvius.

537
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:46,921
The whole city is
turning out to see us off.

538
01:03:46,998 --> 01:03:49,297
Great merciful
bloodstained gods!

539
01:03:50,669 --> 01:03:52,068
Your pardon.

540
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:55,263
I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

541
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:59,239
Did Gracchus have something to
do with this brilliant affair?

542
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:02,678
Yes, he proposed it.
Rather decently, too.

543
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:03,976
And you?

544
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:08,748
Do you think I made you commander to
control some rock patch on Vesuvius?

545
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:11,446
It was to control
the streets of Rome!

546
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:15,357
I only take six cohorts. The
rest of the garrison remain.

547
01:04:15,427 --> 01:04:16,485
Under whose command?

548
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,824
Under Caesar's.

549
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,558
Oh, excellent,
excellent.

550
01:04:20,632 --> 01:04:23,363
Finding Gracchus in control
of the mob and the Senate,

551
01:04:23,435 --> 01:04:26,996
you felt impelled to hand over
the garrison to him also.

552
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,772
I see.

553
01:04:30,308 --> 01:04:33,835
I'll refuse, withdraw
from the expedition.

554
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,880
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician

555
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:38,849
is that occasionally you're
obliged to act like one.

556
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,113
You've pledged to go,
and go you must.

557
01:04:41,186 --> 01:04:43,313
If Gracchus should decide
to move against you...

558
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:45,618
He won't!
Has no need to.

559
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,217
He has, with your assistance,
immobilized me altogether.

560
01:04:50,695 --> 01:04:53,790
Your legions are in camp
outside the city walls?

561
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:56,031
My legions?

562
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:59,432
Do you truly believe I'd
order my legions to enter Rome?

563
01:04:59,504 --> 01:05:02,201
You can, if you have to.

564
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:04,572
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law,

565
01:05:04,643 --> 01:05:08,010
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

566
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,877
Sulla did.
Sulla?

567
01:05:10,015 --> 01:05:11,812
To the infamy
of his name!

568
01:05:11,883 --> 01:05:14,409
To the utter damnation
of his line!

569
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:17,984
No, my young friend.

570
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,784
One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

571
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:26,420
I shall restore all the
traditions that made her great.

572
01:05:27,732 --> 01:05:30,531
It follows that I cannot
come to power or defend myself

573
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:34,163
by an act which betrays the
most sacred tradition of all.

574
01:05:34,673 --> 01:05:38,166
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

575
01:05:39,177 --> 01:05:41,703
I shall not violate Rome

576
01:05:42,347 --> 01:05:44,679
at the moment
of possessing her.

577
01:05:48,753 --> 01:05:49,777
Go.

578
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:52,720
Prepare your troops
at once.

579
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:56,591
March out of Rome tonight,
but the tribute is impossible.

580
01:05:57,262 --> 01:06:01,324
We've already been made to look a fool.
Let's not add the trappings of a clown.

581
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:05,529
Leave by unfrequented streets
without fanfare, without even a drum.

582
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:08,303
Sneak out.

583
01:06:10,442 --> 01:06:11,841
As you wish.

584
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,010
And for heaven's sake,
my young friend,

585
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,277
see to it that you don't
have to sneak back again.

586
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:20,680
Farewell.

587
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:48,055
Come on,
fat boy!

588
01:09:30,608 --> 01:09:31,598
Spartacus, come on!

589
01:09:31,676 --> 01:09:32,836
Come on!

590
01:09:32,911 --> 01:09:34,401
Noble Romans.

591
01:09:34,913 --> 01:09:36,972
Fighting each other
like animals.

592
01:09:38,249 --> 01:09:41,446
Your new masters, betting
to see who'll die first.

593
01:09:44,155 --> 01:09:45,782
Drop your swords.

594
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,923
No! No!
No! No!

595
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:56,830
I want to see their blood
here where Draba died!

596
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:02,036
When I fight matched pairs,
they fight to the death.

597
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:05,773
I made myself a promise,
Crixus.

598
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,172
I swore that if I ever
got out of this place,

599
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:11,477
I'd die before I'd watch two
men fight to the death again.

600
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,449
Draba made that promise,
too.

601
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,289
He kept it.

602
01:10:21,993 --> 01:10:23,324
So will I.

603
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:28,791
Go on. Get out!

604
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,404
What are we,
Crixus?

605
01:10:34,472 --> 01:10:37,066
What are we becoming?
Romans?

606
01:10:37,141 --> 01:10:40,134
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?

607
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:42,646
We look for wine when
we should be hunting bread.

608
01:10:42,714 --> 01:10:45,478
When you've got wine,
you don't need bread!

609
01:10:46,985 --> 01:10:50,045
We can't just be a gang
of drunken raiders.

610
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:51,452
What else
can we be?

611
01:10:51,522 --> 01:10:52,546
Gladiators.

612
01:10:53,725 --> 01:10:55,591
An army of gladiators.

613
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,422
There's never been
an army like that.

614
01:10:58,496 --> 01:11:01,329
One gladiator's worth
any two Roman soldiers.

615
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:04,232
We beat the Roman guards here,
but a Roman army's different.

616
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,464
They fight different.

617
01:11:06,537 --> 01:11:09,564
We can beat anything they
send against us if we want to.

618
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,575
It takes a big army.

619
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:13,110
We'll have
a big army.

620
01:11:13,177 --> 01:11:17,273
Once we're on the march, we'll free
every slave in every town and village.

621
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:19,317
Can anybody
get a bigger army?

622
01:11:19,384 --> 01:11:21,614
Once we cross the Alps,
we're safe.

623
01:11:21,686 --> 01:11:24,917
Nobody can cross the Alps. Every
pass is defended by its own legion.

624
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:28,118
There's only one way
to get out of this country.

625
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:30,224
The sea.

626
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:33,025
What good is the sea
if you have no ships?

627
01:11:33,097 --> 01:11:35,430
The Cilician pirates
have ships.

628
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,658
They're at war
with Rome.

629
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:41,628
Every Roman galley that sails
out of Brundusium pays tribute.

630
01:11:41,706 --> 01:11:44,937
They've got the biggest fleet in the
world. I was a galley slave with them.

631
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,875
Give them enough gold,
they'll take you anywhere.

632
01:11:46,944 --> 01:11:48,173
We haven't got
enough gold.

633
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:50,942
Take every Roman we capture
and warm his back a little.

634
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,642
We'll have gold all right.

635
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:55,682
Spartacus is right!

636
01:11:56,054 --> 01:11:59,080
Let's hire these pirates and
march straight to Brundusium!

637
01:12:45,937 --> 01:12:48,997
Come join us.
All of you, come join us.

638
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,517
Come on
and join us!

639
01:13:21,973 --> 01:13:23,167
Come on!

640
01:13:23,241 --> 01:13:24,435
Hey!

641
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:35,910
Back to Vesuvius!

642
01:13:57,508 --> 01:13:58,771
Varinia.

643
01:14:04,081 --> 01:14:06,641
I thought
I'd never see you again.

644
01:14:21,032 --> 01:14:23,057
Everything's so different.

645
01:14:29,307 --> 01:14:31,605
The last time I saw you,
you...

646
01:14:32,643 --> 01:14:36,512
You were waiting
in the arena to...

647
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:46,054
I... I thought
you were in Rome.

648
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:52,889
How'd you escape?

649
01:14:53,464 --> 01:14:54,522
I...

650
01:14:55,466 --> 01:14:59,562
I jumped out of the cart
and Batiatus was so fat...

651
01:15:10,581 --> 01:15:12,982
I flew out of the cart

652
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:16,918
and Batiatus
was so fat

653
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:20,081
that he couldn't
catch me.

654
01:15:20,157 --> 01:15:22,353
He couldn't
catch up with me.

655
01:15:23,094 --> 01:15:25,062
Do you realize

656
01:15:25,129 --> 01:15:28,394
nobody can ever
sell you again?

657
01:15:28,466 --> 01:15:30,366
Nobody can sell you.

658
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:33,002
Or give you away.

659
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,335
Nobody can ever
make you stay with anyone.

660
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:37,898
Nobody can make you
stay with anybody.

661
01:15:40,144 --> 01:15:42,875
Oh, I love you,
Spartacus.

662
01:15:46,851 --> 01:15:50,287
I love you.
I love you. I love you.

663
01:15:52,723 --> 01:15:54,714
I still can't believe it.

664
01:15:57,495 --> 01:16:01,397
Forbid me
ever to leave you.

665
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,031
I do forbid you.

666
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:13,010
I forbid you.

667
01:16:14,845 --> 01:16:16,313
I forbid you.

668
01:16:17,381 --> 01:16:19,372
I forbid you.

669
01:16:43,407 --> 01:16:46,001
It was funny
at the time.

670
01:16:46,544 --> 01:16:49,070
How good you are to me,
if I may say so.

671
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:50,910
You may.
Thank you.

672
01:16:51,716 --> 01:16:53,650
Don't just eye those birds. Eat them.

673
01:16:53,718 --> 01:16:56,482
There's no need to be on
your best behavior here.

674
01:16:56,554 --> 01:17:01,549
May I remind you you've
been good to me in the past.

675
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,093
I've been good to you?
Oh, ho, ho.

676
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,321
Oh, yes.

677
01:17:04,395 --> 01:17:08,855
You've sold me slaves at an
extremely reasonable price.

678
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,703
And you arranged gladiatorial
jousts at cost, practically.

679
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:16,869
You are both
ethical in business

680
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:20,138
and certainly
farsighted socially.

681
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,745
Zenobia's put on weight
since I last saw her.

682
01:17:22,813 --> 01:17:24,076
Hasn't she?
I like it.

683
01:17:24,148 --> 01:17:25,274
So do I.

684
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:29,543
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

685
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,250
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

686
01:17:33,324 --> 01:17:37,226
Have you noticed the nastiest
of tyrants are invariably thin?

687
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:43,696
In spite of your vices, you are
the most generous Roman of our time.

688
01:17:43,768 --> 01:17:45,065
Vices?

689
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:48,733
Ladies.

690
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:54,503
Ladies?
Since when are they a vice?

691
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:58,539
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

692
01:17:58,616 --> 01:18:01,016
I hope I pronounced
that word...

693
01:18:01,085 --> 01:18:03,918
It's well-known that even your
groom and butler are women.

694
01:18:03,988 --> 01:18:06,423
I'm the most virtuous man
in Rome.

695
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:10,251
I keep these women out of my
respect for Roman morality.

696
01:18:10,428 --> 01:18:12,726
That morality which
has made Rome strong enough

697
01:18:12,797 --> 01:18:15,527
to steal two-thirds of the
world from its rightful owners,

698
01:18:15,599 --> 01:18:19,195
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

699
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:22,672
I happen to like women.
I have a promiscuous nature

700
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,800
and unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow

701
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:28,470
which my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

702
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:31,811
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

703
01:18:31,882 --> 01:18:33,111
Exactly.

704
01:18:34,285 --> 01:18:37,914
It must be tantalizing to be
surrounded by so much purity.

705
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,222
It is.

706
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:47,288
Let's mix business with
pleasure. How may I help you?

707
01:18:49,834 --> 01:18:53,292
Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate,

708
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,703
but there's one man I can't
think of without fuming.

709
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,241
Who's that?
Crassus.

710
01:18:57,308 --> 01:19:00,038
You've grown
very ambitious in your hatred.

711
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:03,547
Do you blame me? There I was, better
than a millionaire in the morning

712
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:07,983
and a penniless refugee by nightfall
with nothing but rags and my flesh.

713
01:19:08,052 --> 01:19:11,385
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua

714
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:14,618
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs.

715
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,651
These two daughters of Venus

716
01:19:17,728 --> 01:19:20,459
had to taunt the gladiators,
force them to fight to the death,

717
01:19:20,531 --> 01:19:23,557
and before I knew what had
happened, revolution on my hands.

718
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,468
What revenge have you in mind?

719
01:19:29,273 --> 01:19:31,571
I sold Crassus
this woman Varinia.

720
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:32,734
Whom?

721
01:19:33,177 --> 01:19:35,873
Varinia. May the gods
give her wings.

722
01:19:35,946 --> 01:19:37,346
There was no contract,

723
01:19:37,414 --> 01:19:40,873
but she was clearly his slave
as soon as the deal was made.

724
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:43,511
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

725
01:19:43,587 --> 01:19:46,750
And Crassus,
no mention of money.

726
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:50,624
You never offered me
this woman. Why not?

727
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,923
Well, she's not
remotely your type, Gracchus.

728
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,556
She is very thin and...

729
01:19:55,633 --> 01:19:56,930
Look around you.

730
01:19:57,401 --> 01:20:00,234
You'll see women
of all sizes.

731
01:20:00,304 --> 01:20:01,794
Well, yes.

732
01:20:01,872 --> 01:20:04,739
500 sesterces deposit
on Varinia.

733
01:20:04,808 --> 01:20:09,007
Since he hasn't paid, this gives me
first call over Crassus when she's caught.

734
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,480
May the gods adore you.

735
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:14,646
Why do you buy a woman
you've never seen?

736
01:20:14,718 --> 01:20:17,551
To annoy Crassus, of course,
and help you.

737
01:20:24,595 --> 01:20:26,620
Fetch a stool,
Antoninus.

738
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,563
In here with it.

739
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,846
That will do.

740
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,022
Do you steal,
Antoninus?

741
01:20:52,289 --> 01:20:53,655
No, master.

742
01:20:54,658 --> 01:20:56,024
Do you lie?

743
01:20:57,161 --> 01:20:59,027
Not if
I can avoid it.

744
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,932
Have you ever
dishonored the gods?

745
01:21:04,034 --> 01:21:05,400
No, master.

746
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:10,970
Do you refrain from these vices out
of respect for the moral virtues?

747
01:21:11,642 --> 01:21:13,041
Yes, master.

748
01:21:17,181 --> 01:21:18,910
Do you eat
oysters?

749
01:21:19,783 --> 01:21:21,774
When I have them,
master.

750
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,247
Do you eat
snails?

751
01:21:25,289 --> 01:21:26,654
No, master.

752
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:31,060
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral

753
01:21:31,128 --> 01:21:33,825
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

754
01:21:35,532 --> 01:21:36,898
No, master.

755
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:39,292
Of course not.

756
01:21:42,539 --> 01:21:45,168
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

757
01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:47,042
Yes, master.

758
01:21:48,345 --> 01:21:50,939
And taste is not
the same as appetite

759
01:21:51,548 --> 01:21:54,541
and therefore not a
question of morals, is it?

760
01:21:56,887 --> 01:21:57,945
Hmm?

761
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:02,754
It could be
argued so, master.

762
01:22:06,163 --> 01:22:08,928
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.

763
01:22:25,582 --> 01:22:27,483
My taste
includes

764
01:22:28,686 --> 01:22:31,155
both snails
and oysters.

765
01:22:40,464 --> 01:22:42,057
Antoninus, look.

766
01:22:43,434 --> 01:22:45,061
Across the river.

767
01:22:46,403 --> 01:22:48,736
There is something
you must see.

768
01:22:53,077 --> 01:22:55,841
There, boy,
is Rome.

769
01:22:57,247 --> 01:22:59,409
The might,
the majesty,

770
01:23:00,818 --> 01:23:02,547
the terror of Rome.

771
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:09,023
There is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus.

772
01:23:10,761 --> 01:23:12,786
No man
can withstand Rome.

773
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,158
No nation
can withstand her.

774
01:23:17,935 --> 01:23:19,402
How much less

775
01:23:20,838 --> 01:23:21,998
a boy?

776
01:23:24,441 --> 01:23:25,499
Hmm?

777
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:32,410
There's only one way
to deal with Rome, Antoninus.

778
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,879
You must serve her.

779
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:39,112
You must abase yourself
before her.

780
01:23:41,525 --> 01:23:43,653
You must grovel at her feet.

781
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:49,465
You must love her.

782
01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:56,329
Isn't that so, Antoninus?

783
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,542
Antoninus!

784
01:24:04,815 --> 01:24:06,146
Antoninus?

785
01:25:39,309 --> 01:25:41,005
Take your time!

786
01:25:41,078 --> 01:25:42,511
How are they coming?
Good.

787
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:45,481
Give me another thousand like
them and we can march on Rome.

788
01:25:45,582 --> 01:25:47,346
Come on,
once again.

789
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:08,004
Here, on Vesuvius, we're safe from attack
while we organize ourselves into an army.

790
01:26:08,071 --> 01:26:10,404
It may take six months,
a year.

791
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:14,206
Once we're strong, we're gonna
fight our way south to the sea.

792
01:26:14,278 --> 01:26:17,441
We're going to arrange for
ships with the Cilician pirates.

793
01:26:17,514 --> 01:26:19,744
The sea will be
our road home.

794
01:26:20,684 --> 01:26:22,914
If you agree,
you may join us.

795
01:26:23,086 --> 01:26:26,887
If you don't agree, go back
before your escape is discovered.

796
01:26:28,425 --> 01:26:29,950
Too many women.

797
01:26:30,527 --> 01:26:32,495
What's wrong
with women?

798
01:26:32,596 --> 01:26:34,860
Where would you be now,
you lout,

799
01:26:34,932 --> 01:26:37,401
if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell

800
01:26:37,467 --> 01:26:39,459
to get you into
this accursed world?

801
01:26:39,536 --> 01:26:42,563
I can handle a knife in
the dark as well as anyone.

802
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,835
I can cast spells
and brew poisons.

803
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:48,003
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters.

804
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:51,737
I want to see
Spartacus.

805
01:26:51,815 --> 01:26:54,045
All right, grandmother.
I'm Spartacus.

806
01:26:54,117 --> 01:26:55,483
Stay with us.

807
01:26:55,552 --> 01:26:59,079
We'll need a million Roman
shrouds before we're through.

808
01:27:02,292 --> 01:27:03,555
Where do you
come from?

809
01:27:03,627 --> 01:27:06,358
Most of us come
from the estate of Lillius.

810
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,658
What kind of work
did you do there?

811
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:09,961
Sixteen years a carpenter,
a mason.

812
01:27:10,033 --> 01:27:12,297
Good.
We can use carpenters.

813
01:27:14,538 --> 01:27:15,596
What kind of work
did you do?

814
01:27:15,672 --> 01:27:17,003
Chief steward.

815
01:27:17,074 --> 01:27:20,441
You'll help with the food
supplies. Report to Patullus.

816
01:27:21,478 --> 01:27:23,674
What kind of work
did you do?

817
01:27:24,715 --> 01:27:26,307
Singer of songs.

818
01:27:27,017 --> 01:27:28,610
Singer of songs?

819
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:30,810
But what work
did you do?

820
01:27:31,154 --> 01:27:33,384
That's my work.
I also juggle.

821
01:27:34,157 --> 01:27:36,285
Juggle.
What else do you do?

822
01:27:36,827 --> 01:27:38,795
I can do
feats of magic.

823
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:40,390
Magic?

824
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,328
Maybe he can make
the Romans disappear.

825
01:29:11,755 --> 01:29:13,917
I'll need one volunteer,
man or woman.

826
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:16,220
How about you?
You, sir?

827
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:19,195
Here we have
a likely subject.

828
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:23,825
You'll notice there is nothing
in my hand, true?

829
01:29:24,434 --> 01:29:26,300
How many fingers do you see?
Three.

830
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:27,496
How many fingers
do you see?

831
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,595
Three.

832
01:29:28,672 --> 01:29:32,734
I make a bowl. My hand is upside
down and I ask you to blow at it.

833
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,208
Not hard enough.
Hard!

834
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,109
Thank you.

835
01:29:45,722 --> 01:29:47,588
Would you like to try?

836
01:29:51,328 --> 01:29:53,660
Hit it against the rock,
gently.

837
01:30:01,705 --> 01:30:04,197
Poet, I haven't had
an egg in days.

838
01:30:05,575 --> 01:30:06,975
You haven't?

839
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,074
Here.
Thank you.

840
01:30:12,849 --> 01:30:15,341
I'm not going to
let mine get away.

841
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:36,606
Sing us a song.

842
01:30:36,673 --> 01:30:38,767
Sing us a song,
Antoninus.

843
01:30:39,176 --> 01:30:40,768
Sing, Antoninus.

844
01:30:44,047 --> 01:30:47,483
When the blazing sun hangs low
in the western sky,

845
01:30:49,452 --> 01:30:52,081
when the wind dies away
on the mountain,

846
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:58,022
when the song
of the meadowlark turns still,

847
01:31:00,397 --> 01:31:03,594
when the field locust clicks
no more in the field,

848
01:31:05,735 --> 01:31:08,728
and the sea foam
sleeps like a maiden at rest,

849
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:12,975
and twilight touches the shape
of the wondering earth,

850
01:31:13,443 --> 01:31:14,843
I turn home.

851
01:31:16,112 --> 01:31:18,707
Through blue shadows
and purple woods,

852
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:21,316
I turn home.

853
01:31:22,819 --> 01:31:25,345
I turn to the place
that I was born,

854
01:31:25,622 --> 01:31:29,058
to the mother who bore me
and the father who taught me,

855
01:31:29,492 --> 01:31:33,224
long ago, long ago, long ago.

856
01:31:35,432 --> 01:31:39,733
Alone am I now, lost and alone
in a far, wide, wondering world.

857
01:31:41,571 --> 01:31:45,030
Yet still when the blazing sun
hangs low,

858
01:31:46,977 --> 01:31:50,071
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps,

859
01:31:51,681 --> 01:31:54,480
and twilight touches
the wondering earth,

860
01:31:56,353 --> 01:31:57,752
I turn home.

861
01:32:03,927 --> 01:32:06,055
Where'd you
learn that song?

862
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:08,855
My father
taught it to me.

863
01:32:09,933 --> 01:32:12,061
I was wrong
about you, poet.

864
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:14,769
You won't learn to kill.
You'll teach us songs.

865
01:32:14,838 --> 01:32:16,635
I came here to fight.

866
01:32:18,675 --> 01:32:20,700
Anyone
can learn to fight.

867
01:32:21,511 --> 01:32:23,172
I joined to fight.

868
01:32:27,117 --> 01:32:28,675
What's your name?

869
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:30,219
Antoninus.

870
01:32:32,289 --> 01:32:33,620
Antoninus.

871
01:32:34,791 --> 01:32:38,056
There's a time for fighting
and a time for singing.

872
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,519
Now you
teach us to sing.

873
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:42,690
Sing, Antoninus.

874
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:52,666
When the blazing sun hangs low
in the western sky...

875
01:32:54,644 --> 01:32:56,613
You like him,
don't you?

876
01:33:01,084 --> 01:33:02,813
Who wants to fight?

877
01:33:05,855 --> 01:33:08,051
An animal
can learn to fight.

878
01:33:11,594 --> 01:33:13,722
But to sing
beautiful things

879
01:33:15,365 --> 01:33:17,663
and make people
believe them...

880
01:33:20,003 --> 01:33:21,402
Hmm.

881
01:33:27,677 --> 01:33:29,805
What are you
thinking about?

882
01:33:37,387 --> 01:33:38,650
I'm free.

883
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:42,620
And what do I know?

884
01:33:44,094 --> 01:33:46,324
I don't even know
how to read.

885
01:33:48,465 --> 01:33:51,059
You know things
that can't be taught.

886
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:54,994
I know nothing.

887
01:33:55,905 --> 01:33:57,168
Nothing.

888
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:03,712
And I want to know.
I want to...

889
01:34:07,484 --> 01:34:09,008
I want to know.

890
01:34:10,553 --> 01:34:11,885
Know what?

891
01:34:16,626 --> 01:34:17,991
Everything.

892
01:34:20,463 --> 01:34:23,160
Why a star falls
and a bird doesn't.

893
01:34:24,134 --> 01:34:26,261
Where the sun
goes at night.

894
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:29,063
Why the moon
changes shape.

895
01:34:33,843 --> 01:34:36,642
I want to know
where the wind comes from.

896
01:34:43,753 --> 01:34:45,778
The wind
begins in a cave.

897
01:34:47,357 --> 01:34:50,918
Far to the north, a young
god sleeps in that cave.

898
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:55,831
He dreams of a girl
and he sighs,

899
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,297
and the night wind
stirs with his breath.

900
01:35:09,813 --> 01:35:12,008
I want to know
all about you.

901
01:35:15,452 --> 01:35:19,650
Every line,
every curve.

902
01:35:23,693 --> 01:35:26,094
I want to know
every part of you.

903
01:35:29,032 --> 01:35:31,023
Every beat
of your heart.

904
01:35:56,893 --> 01:35:59,385
Go on about
the city of Metapontum.

905
01:35:59,596 --> 01:36:02,030
What garrisons
will we find there?

906
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:07,194
There are two legions in the
garrison. Some have been sent south...

907
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:09,295
Set the litter down there.

908
01:36:25,255 --> 01:36:28,520
Well, where is this
slave general?

909
01:36:32,562 --> 01:36:34,655
Dionysius, get the litter
bearers out of the rain.

910
01:36:34,731 --> 01:36:37,461
Give them food,
a bed and their freedom.

911
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:40,597
All right, follow me.

912
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,434
We'll pay you
for them.

913
01:36:42,572 --> 01:36:44,904
We have no slaves
in this camp.

914
01:36:50,547 --> 01:36:52,981
Tigranes Levantus
at your service.

915
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,208
My credentials.

916
01:37:00,089 --> 01:37:01,352
Come in.

917
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:07,523
"To the General of the
Italian slaves called Spartacus

918
01:37:07,597 --> 01:37:10,623
"from Ibar M'hali,
Cilician Governor of Delos. "

919
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:12,668
Sit down.
"Greetings.

920
01:37:12,735 --> 01:37:17,400
"Word has been received that you wish to
embark your armies on the Cilician ships

921
01:37:17,473 --> 01:37:19,635
"from the Italian port
of Brundusium.

922
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:21,677
"Receive my agent,
Tigranes... "

923
01:37:21,744 --> 01:37:22,734
Levantus.

924
01:37:23,246 --> 01:37:24,679
"... who bargains
in my name.

925
01:37:24,747 --> 01:37:27,683
"May Isis and Serapis
bring victory to your cause.

926
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,082
"The Governor of Delos. "

927
01:37:29,152 --> 01:37:31,086
Who are
Isis and Serapis?

928
01:37:31,154 --> 01:37:32,451
Gods of the East.

929
01:37:32,755 --> 01:37:35,054
Why should they
want us to win?

930
01:37:35,258 --> 01:37:38,922
Because
they favor Cilicia,

931
01:37:38,995 --> 01:37:42,158
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

932
01:37:46,469 --> 01:37:48,460
Would you like
some wine?

933
01:37:49,005 --> 01:37:52,908
I drink only after the bargain
has been concluded, never before.

934
01:38:01,551 --> 01:38:04,247
How many ships
do these Cilicians have?

935
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,811
Five hundred, at least.

936
01:38:06,522 --> 01:38:08,650
But no deal is too small,
I assure you.

937
01:38:08,725 --> 01:38:10,488
We'll need them all.

938
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:12,153
All?

939
01:38:12,228 --> 01:38:13,696
What is the price?

940
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:19,263
Price is
100,000 sesterces per ship.

941
01:38:20,637 --> 01:38:23,538
For 500 ships,
that would be

942
01:38:24,574 --> 01:38:26,872
50 million sesterces.

943
01:38:28,378 --> 01:38:30,972
You have such a sum?

944
01:38:31,047 --> 01:38:32,139
We will have.

945
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:37,913
See for yourself.

946
01:38:41,524 --> 01:38:42,889
Beautiful.

947
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,256
When will the ships
be ready?

948
01:38:44,327 --> 01:38:45,726
Beautiful.

949
01:38:46,162 --> 01:38:48,392
I love to see
such beauty.

950
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:50,660
When will the ships
be ready?

951
01:38:51,401 --> 01:38:54,666
Ah, my friend,
when will you be ready?

952
01:38:56,372 --> 01:38:58,341
How long
will it take you

953
01:39:00,176 --> 01:39:04,909
to cross one-third the length of Italy
fighting a major battle in every town?

954
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:06,744
One year?
Two years?

955
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:11,985
If we're not in Brundusium seven
months from now, we'll never be there.

956
01:39:14,257 --> 01:39:16,487
What if we
assemble the ships,

957
01:39:17,927 --> 01:39:21,124
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them?

958
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:26,260
We'll give you a chest of treasure
now, the rest when we get to Brundusium.

959
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:28,065
This one?
Yes.

960
01:39:29,972 --> 01:39:31,065
Done!

961
01:39:31,441 --> 01:39:34,638
Seven months from now
the ships will be assembled.

962
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,079
Arrange to have
the chest loaded.

963
01:39:38,648 --> 01:39:40,013
And now,
with your permission,

964
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,552
I should like to have
the wine you offered me.

965
01:39:42,618 --> 01:39:43,677
Will you join me?

966
01:39:43,753 --> 01:39:44,913
I will.

967
01:39:45,221 --> 01:39:46,848
Excellent workmanship.

968
01:39:46,923 --> 01:39:49,153
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

969
01:39:49,225 --> 01:39:52,320
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

970
01:39:52,628 --> 01:39:54,597
I'm the son
and grandson of slaves.

971
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:57,530
I knew that,
when I saw you couldn't read.

972
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:02,433
Of course, it pleases Roman
vanity to think that you are noble.

973
01:40:02,505 --> 01:40:05,236
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves,

974
01:40:05,308 --> 01:40:07,538
especially a man
like Crassus.

975
01:40:09,512 --> 01:40:11,776
You know him?

976
01:40:11,848 --> 01:40:13,907
I entertained him
one afternoon.

977
01:40:14,350 --> 01:40:15,374
You?

978
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:16,612
In the arena.

979
01:40:19,188 --> 01:40:20,713
Excellent wine.

980
01:40:22,658 --> 01:40:24,024
May I...

981
01:40:24,527 --> 01:40:26,359
May I ask you something?

982
01:40:26,429 --> 01:40:27,919
You can ask.

983
01:40:27,997 --> 01:40:31,092
Surely you know you're
going to lose, don't you?

984
01:40:33,035 --> 01:40:34,367
You have no chance.

985
01:40:34,437 --> 01:40:37,497
At this very moment, six
cohorts of the garrison of Rome

986
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:39,803
are approaching
this position.

987
01:40:42,311 --> 01:40:44,303
What are you going to do?

988
01:40:49,385 --> 01:40:51,979
We'll decide that
when they get here.

989
01:40:56,292 --> 01:40:58,317
Let me put it differently.

990
01:40:58,494 --> 01:41:01,225
If you looked into
a magic crystal

991
01:41:02,064 --> 01:41:05,557
and you saw your army
destroyed and yourself dead,

992
01:41:06,302 --> 01:41:11,103
if you saw that in the future,
as I'm sure you're seeing it now,

993
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:13,668
would you continue to fight?

994
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:15,534
Yes.

995
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:17,705
Knowing that you must lose?

996
01:41:18,915 --> 01:41:20,542
Knowing we can't.

997
01:41:22,084 --> 01:41:24,383
All men lose
when they die.

998
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:28,481
And all men die, but a slave and
a free man lose different things.

999
01:41:28,558 --> 01:41:30,355
They both lose life.

1000
01:41:30,426 --> 01:41:33,726
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

1001
01:41:34,764 --> 01:41:36,664
A slave loses his pain.

1002
01:41:38,701 --> 01:41:41,432
Death is the only freedom
a slave knows.

1003
01:41:41,704 --> 01:41:44,105
That's why
he's not afraid of it.

1004
01:41:46,108 --> 01:41:47,906
That's why we'll win.

1005
01:42:16,539 --> 01:42:18,940
Spartacus,
that pirate was right.

1006
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:24,203
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

1007
01:42:25,281 --> 01:42:27,977
How many are there?
About six cohorts.

1008
01:42:28,251 --> 01:42:29,377
Where?

1009
01:42:29,452 --> 01:42:32,148
At the mouth of the valley,
against the cliffs.

1010
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:36,116
Strong camp?

1011
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:38,092
They've built
no stockade.

1012
01:42:40,263 --> 01:42:41,696
No stockade?

1013
01:42:42,131 --> 01:42:43,121
Are you sure?

1014
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,758
I'm very sure.

1015
01:42:45,101 --> 01:42:47,763
This campaign
is great sport for them.

1016
01:42:47,837 --> 01:42:50,101
The Romans
are having a picnic.

1017
01:42:50,172 --> 01:42:51,231
Did they see you?

1018
01:42:51,307 --> 01:42:52,797
No. We were hidden.

1019
01:42:56,279 --> 01:42:59,009
Maybe we ought to join
this Roman picnic.

1020
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:00,572
Form your men.

1021
01:43:06,522 --> 01:43:07,922
Six cohorts.

1022
01:43:09,191 --> 01:43:13,720
A lot of arms and weapons
to build our army with.

1023
01:43:41,657 --> 01:43:44,285
Crixus always wanted
to march on Rome.

1024
01:43:45,328 --> 01:43:47,228
Now he doesn't have to.

1025
01:43:47,997 --> 01:43:49,658
Rome's come to us.

1026
01:44:55,865 --> 01:44:58,356
Half this way!
The rest over there.

1027
01:45:19,555 --> 01:45:22,923
Stand up, the way
a noble Roman should!

1028
01:45:23,259 --> 01:45:25,352
That's Roman pride
for you!

1029
01:45:31,767 --> 01:45:33,258
That's better.

1030
01:45:35,171 --> 01:45:36,798
What's your name?

1031
01:45:37,573 --> 01:45:39,564
Marcus Glabrus.

1032
01:45:40,109 --> 01:45:41,338
Glabrus.

1033
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:44,509
Commander
of the garrison of Rome.

1034
01:45:45,247 --> 01:45:46,340
Commander?

1035
01:45:46,415 --> 01:45:49,942
He was commanding it on his belly
when we found him, playing dead!

1036
01:45:53,756 --> 01:45:56,191
You disappoint me,
Marcus Glabrus.

1037
01:45:57,193 --> 01:45:58,660
Playing dead.

1038
01:46:00,496 --> 01:46:02,157
You afraid to die?

1039
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:05,693
It's easy to die.

1040
01:46:06,502 --> 01:46:08,197
Haven't you seen enough
gladiators in the arena

1041
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:10,466
to see
how easy it is to die?

1042
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,769
Of course you have.

1043
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:14,808
What are you...

1044
01:46:15,811 --> 01:46:18,110
What are you
going to do to me?

1045
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,648
I don't know.

1046
01:46:21,317 --> 01:46:22,716
What should we
do with him?

1047
01:46:22,785 --> 01:46:25,481
Let's have a matched pair,
him and me.

1048
01:46:27,389 --> 01:46:29,756
I'll not fight
like a gladiator!

1049
01:46:35,131 --> 01:46:37,122
You keep staring at this.

1050
01:46:37,867 --> 01:46:39,994
Do you recognize
this baton?

1051
01:46:41,137 --> 01:46:42,764
Yes!
You should!

1052
01:46:43,372 --> 01:46:45,136
It was in your tent.

1053
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:49,244
The symbol
of the Senate.

1054
01:46:49,345 --> 01:46:51,245
All the power
of Rome!

1055
01:46:54,316 --> 01:46:56,307
That's the power
of Rome!

1056
01:46:59,188 --> 01:47:01,418
Take that back
to your Senate.

1057
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:05,786
Tell them you and that broken stick is
all that's left of the garrison of Rome!

1058
01:47:05,861 --> 01:47:08,592
Tell them we want
nothing from Rome.

1059
01:47:08,664 --> 01:47:11,292
Nothing,
except our freedom!

1060
01:47:11,367 --> 01:47:14,234
All we want is to get out
of this damn country!

1061
01:47:14,303 --> 01:47:16,601
We're marching south
to the sea.

1062
01:47:16,672 --> 01:47:19,266
And we'll smash every army
they send against us.

1063
01:47:19,341 --> 01:47:20,809
Put him on a horse!

1064
01:50:20,856 --> 01:50:24,759
Their leader said their
hatred of Rome was such

1065
01:50:24,827 --> 01:50:27,762
that all they wished was
to escape from her rule.

1066
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:31,823
If unopposed, he promised
a peaceful march to the sea.

1067
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:35,359
If opposed, he threatens
to ravage the countryside

1068
01:50:35,437 --> 01:50:37,838
and destroy every legion
sent against him.

1069
01:50:37,906 --> 01:50:39,841
And once they
get to the sea?

1070
01:50:39,908 --> 01:50:44,437
They plan to take ship with Cilician
pirates and return to their homes.

1071
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:47,039
From which port
do they propose to embark?

1072
01:50:47,116 --> 01:50:48,583
I don't know.

1073
01:50:49,018 --> 01:50:51,543
But city garrisons
can't stand up to them.

1074
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:54,612
If they are to be intercepted,
it's work for the legions!

1075
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:57,785
What sort of a man is
this leader of the slaves?

1076
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:00,055
I don't know.

1077
01:51:00,496 --> 01:51:02,930
I think
they called him Spartacus.

1078
01:51:04,166 --> 01:51:05,497
Spartacus.

1079
01:51:07,069 --> 01:51:08,935
Is that name
familiar to you?

1080
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,607
Yes, it does
seem to be.

1081
01:51:13,642 --> 01:51:15,269
I can't place it.

1082
01:51:16,045 --> 01:51:18,673
After he talked to you,
what happened?

1083
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:22,150
I was tied to a horse
and lashed out of camp.

1084
01:51:24,286 --> 01:51:26,687
How many of your company
escaped?

1085
01:51:27,623 --> 01:51:29,921
Fourteen
have reported thus far.

1086
01:51:29,992 --> 01:51:33,155
I, myself, was taken prisoner
in my own command tent.

1087
01:51:33,228 --> 01:51:37,461
The camp was thoroughly infiltrated
before an alarm could be sounded.

1088
01:51:38,434 --> 01:51:42,131
Did you surround your camp
with moat and stockade?

1089
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:51,770
No.

1090
01:51:53,348 --> 01:51:57,410
We arrived after sunset. Sentries
were posted every 10 paces.

1091
01:51:57,486 --> 01:52:00,649
There was no reason
to expect an attack by night.

1092
01:52:01,156 --> 01:52:04,092
Then again,
well, they...

1093
01:52:07,296 --> 01:52:08,559
Continue.

1094
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,066
They were only slaves.

1095
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:17,599
I see.

1096
01:52:20,442 --> 01:52:24,606
I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus
has disgraced the arms of Rome.

1097
01:52:25,848 --> 01:52:28,908
Let the punishment of
the Senate be pronounced.

1098
01:52:33,922 --> 01:52:37,017
If we punished every commander
who made a fool of himself,

1099
01:52:37,092 --> 01:52:40,528
we wouldn't have anyone left
above the rank of centurion.

1100
01:52:41,797 --> 01:52:44,732
But this is a case
of criminal carelessness!

1101
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,635
Six cohorts
have been slaughtered.

1102
01:52:48,103 --> 01:52:52,734
Crassus sponsored this young
man. Let him pronounce sentence.

1103
01:52:56,678 --> 01:52:58,874
The punishment
is well-known!

1104
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:05,519
Let Publius Marcus Glabrus be
denied fire, water, food and shelter

1105
01:53:05,587 --> 01:53:08,921
for a distance of 400 miles in all
directions from the city of Rome.

1106
01:53:13,862 --> 01:53:15,387
One thing more.

1107
01:53:16,064 --> 01:53:20,502
Glabrus is my friend and I will not
dissociate myself from his disgrace.

1108
01:53:20,636 --> 01:53:25,369
I now lay down the command of my
legions and retire to private life.

1109
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:39,647
Goodbye, Crassus.

1110
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:46,055
This is no time for a man of honor
to withdraw from public affairs!

1111
01:53:46,128 --> 01:53:47,561
All: Shame, shame!

1112
01:53:47,629 --> 01:53:49,097
Sit down.

1113
01:53:49,398 --> 01:53:52,891
This sort of heroic public
behavior is nothing new.

1114
01:53:52,968 --> 01:53:55,801
I've seen it before,
and I know the meaning of it.

1115
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:57,566
Crassus acted
on a point of honor!

1116
01:53:57,639 --> 01:53:59,164
Patrician honor!

1117
01:54:00,008 --> 01:54:02,443
No matter how noble
this looks from the outside,

1118
01:54:02,511 --> 01:54:04,536
I don't like
the color of it.

1119
01:54:04,613 --> 01:54:06,581
Crassus is
the only man in Rome

1120
01:54:06,648 --> 01:54:10,608
who hasn't yielded to republican
corruption and never will!

1121
01:54:10,686 --> 01:54:14,884
I'll take a little republican corruption
along with a little republican freedom

1122
01:54:14,957 --> 01:54:18,916
but I won't take
the dictatorship of Crassus

1123
01:54:18,994 --> 01:54:21,326
and no freedom at all!

1124
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:27,665
That's what he's out for
and that's why he'll be back.

1125
01:58:19,134 --> 01:58:22,126
To the mother
that bore me,

1126
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:26,267
to the father
that taught me,

1127
01:58:28,076 --> 01:58:29,567
to the god...

1128
01:58:32,848 --> 01:58:36,284
To the blue woods and
the purple shadows, I...

1129
01:58:36,351 --> 01:58:38,877
To blue shadows
and purple woods.

1130
01:58:39,654 --> 01:58:41,554
Spartacus,
you frightened me!

1131
01:58:41,623 --> 01:58:42,988
I'm sorry.

1132
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,194
How long
have you been there?

1133
01:58:47,262 --> 01:58:48,821
A little while.

1134
01:58:50,131 --> 01:58:51,963
Why didn't you
say something?

1135
01:58:52,033 --> 01:58:54,002
You seemed so happy.
I didn't want to bother you.

1136
01:58:54,069 --> 01:58:55,468
I am happy.

1137
01:58:56,705 --> 01:59:00,368
Spartacus, I've been trying to
remember the song that Antoninus sang.

1138
01:59:00,442 --> 01:59:05,437
Is it blue shadows and purple woods,
or is it purple woods and blue shadows?

1139
01:59:05,847 --> 01:59:07,941
I want to make love
to my wife!

1140
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:12,287
Spartacus, put me down.
I'm dripping!

1141
01:59:12,354 --> 01:59:13,617
I don't care.

1142
01:59:14,856 --> 01:59:16,153
You've got, you've...

1143
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,214
Yes?

1144
01:59:17,726 --> 01:59:19,819
You have to be gentle
with me.

1145
01:59:20,095 --> 01:59:22,188
Why?
Why, darling?

1146
01:59:23,431 --> 01:59:26,299
I'm going to have a baby.
Now put me down.

1147
01:59:29,204 --> 01:59:30,296
What?

1148
01:59:32,807 --> 01:59:34,002
A baby.

1149
01:59:38,947 --> 01:59:40,415
A baby? When?

1150
01:59:43,652 --> 01:59:45,142
In the spring.

1151
01:59:47,689 --> 01:59:50,715
Well, how? I mean,
how do you know?

1152
01:59:51,293 --> 01:59:52,658
I know.

1153
01:59:53,695 --> 01:59:55,493
A baby in the spring.

1154
01:59:57,699 --> 01:59:59,098
I'm gonna have a son.

1155
01:59:59,167 --> 02:00:00,532
It might be a daughter.

1156
02:00:00,602 --> 02:00:02,593
Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.

1157
02:00:02,671 --> 02:00:05,265
You're cold.
Here, get underneath this.

1158
02:00:06,508 --> 02:00:08,101
Did I hurt you?
No, you didn't.

1159
02:00:08,176 --> 02:00:09,803
I didn't mean
to be so rough.

1160
02:00:09,878 --> 02:00:11,437
Why don't you kiss me?

1161
02:00:11,513 --> 02:00:14,642
This is the first time I was
ever going to have a baby.

1162
02:00:14,716 --> 02:00:16,047
Varinia.

1163
02:00:19,988 --> 02:00:21,183
A baby.

1164
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:25,091
I'm just the same
as I ever was, Spartacus.

1165
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:36,961
I won't break.

1166
02:01:06,668 --> 02:01:11,264
These slaves have already cost
us a thousand million sesterces.

1167
02:01:11,339 --> 02:01:15,435
If now they want to relieve us
of their unwelcome presence,

1168
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:17,604
let them go!
Lmpossible.

1169
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:20,045
They've infected half of
Italy with this uprising.

1170
02:01:20,115 --> 02:01:22,106
If we permit them
to escape,

1171
02:01:22,183 --> 02:01:25,176
this will spread
throughout the entire empire.

1172
02:01:30,925 --> 02:01:33,394
The Republic

1173
02:01:34,562 --> 02:01:37,623
is still weak
from 20 years of civil strife.

1174
02:01:37,699 --> 02:01:40,191
We're engaged
in two wars,

1175
02:01:40,735 --> 02:01:43,329
one in Spain
and the other in Asia.

1176
02:01:44,172 --> 02:01:48,006
Pirates have cut off
our Egyptian grain supply,

1177
02:01:48,309 --> 02:01:52,178
and Spartacus raids the
commerce of all south Italy.

1178
02:01:53,081 --> 02:01:57,450
Half the precincts of Rome
are without bread!

1179
02:01:58,453 --> 02:02:00,546
The city is
close to panic.

1180
02:02:02,424 --> 02:02:05,120
There are two things
we must do immediately!

1181
02:02:05,193 --> 02:02:08,993
Confirm Caesar as permanent
commander of the garrison

1182
02:02:10,698 --> 02:02:12,291
And...

1183
02:02:12,801 --> 02:02:15,292
And assign two legions

1184
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:20,274
to intercept and destroy Spartacus
at the city of Metapontum!

1185
02:03:26,641 --> 02:03:29,474
If we could only have had
Batiatus in the other pot!

1186
02:03:29,544 --> 02:03:32,240
Now you're talking!
Varinia, wonderful meal.

1187
02:03:33,047 --> 02:03:34,037
Varinia.

1188
02:03:34,115 --> 02:03:37,176
A small piece of land
with a few goats on it.

1189
02:03:37,252 --> 02:03:38,310
Oh, no, no.

1190
02:03:38,386 --> 02:03:39,478
I don't care.

1191
02:03:39,554 --> 02:03:41,044
The best wine
in the world.

1192
02:03:41,122 --> 02:03:43,352
For wine,
you've got to go to Aquitania.

1193
02:03:46,628 --> 02:03:49,097
Come to Lidya for wine.
That's the best.

1194
02:03:49,164 --> 02:03:50,995
The best wine
comes from Greece.

1195
02:03:51,065 --> 02:03:53,261
Everybody knows that,
even the Romans!

1196
02:03:53,334 --> 02:03:54,996
No, Lidya!

1197
02:03:58,540 --> 02:03:59,598
You're all wrong!

1198
02:03:59,674 --> 02:04:01,904
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

1199
02:04:01,976 --> 02:04:03,273
I agree with you.

1200
02:04:25,567 --> 02:04:26,898
Gentlemen.

1201
02:04:27,969 --> 02:04:29,733
Any reports
on Metapontum?

1202
02:04:29,804 --> 02:04:31,602
Heralds are crying
the news now.

1203
02:04:31,673 --> 02:04:34,699
We lost 10,000 men, including
Commodius and his officers.

1204
02:04:34,776 --> 02:04:36,437
Nineteen thousand?

1205
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,775
Have you estates
in Metapontum?

1206
02:04:41,115 --> 02:04:42,139
No.

1207
02:04:42,317 --> 02:04:44,114
A son with Commodius.

1208
02:04:45,486 --> 02:04:47,785
With your permission,
good day.

1209
02:04:50,258 --> 02:04:53,717
We take five years
to train a legion.

1210
02:04:53,795 --> 02:04:58,027
How can this Spartacus train
an army in seven months?

1211
02:04:58,099 --> 02:05:00,898
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

1212
02:05:01,502 --> 02:05:03,061
We should have
an investigation.

1213
02:05:03,137 --> 02:05:04,628
By all means,
an investigation.

1214
02:05:04,706 --> 02:05:06,037
Where is
Spartacus now?

1215
02:05:06,107 --> 02:05:08,872
He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.

1216
02:05:08,943 --> 02:05:11,708
I need a few moments
of the Commander's time.

1217
02:05:11,779 --> 02:05:13,509
Will you excuse us?

1218
02:05:18,853 --> 02:05:23,256
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

1219
02:05:23,958 --> 02:05:25,983
Not a very
splendid house.

1220
02:05:26,527 --> 02:05:29,292
And you feasted 11,000
plebeians in the Field of Mars.

1221
02:05:29,364 --> 02:05:31,890
It scarcely could've been
called a feast.

1222
02:05:32,634 --> 02:05:34,864
For 200 years, your family
and mine have been members

1223
02:05:34,936 --> 02:05:38,099
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party,

1224
02:05:38,172 --> 02:05:40,107
servants and rulers
of Rome.

1225
02:05:41,242 --> 02:05:43,768
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

1226
02:05:43,845 --> 02:05:46,371
I've left no one,
least of all Rome.

1227
02:05:46,948 --> 02:05:51,010
But this much I've learned
from Gracchus, Rome is the mob.

1228
02:05:51,085 --> 02:05:52,109
No!

1229
02:05:52,987 --> 02:05:55,980
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

1230
02:05:56,724 --> 02:05:59,250
I had no idea
you'd grown religious.

1231
02:05:59,694 --> 02:06:01,389
That doesn't matter.

1232
02:06:01,462 --> 02:06:04,125
If there were no gods at all,
I'd revere them.

1233
02:06:04,198 --> 02:06:07,635
If there were no Rome,
I'd dream of her

1234
02:06:07,702 --> 02:06:09,465
as I want you
to do.

1235
02:06:10,972 --> 02:06:13,771
I want you to come back
to your own kind.

1236
02:06:14,075 --> 02:06:15,543
I beg you to.

1237
02:06:16,678 --> 02:06:19,477
Is it me you want,
or is it the garrison?

1238
02:06:20,381 --> 02:06:21,474
Both.

1239
02:06:21,916 --> 02:06:23,509
Tell me frankly.

1240
02:06:23,584 --> 02:06:26,645
If you were I, would you take
the field against Spartacus?

1241
02:06:26,721 --> 02:06:28,314
Of course.
Why?

1242
02:06:28,589 --> 02:06:30,922
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

1243
02:06:30,992 --> 02:06:32,721
Ah, Caesar!

1244
02:06:33,227 --> 02:06:34,593
Which Rome?

1245
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:36,157
Theirs

1246
02:06:36,931 --> 02:06:38,194
or ours?

1247
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:44,268
You know Gracchus
is my friend.

1248
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:47,970
I won't betray him.

1249
02:06:49,911 --> 02:06:51,105
Caesar?

1250
02:06:55,249 --> 02:06:57,980
Which is worse? To betray a
friend or betray Rome herself?

1251
02:06:58,052 --> 02:07:00,282
My dear Crassus,
I face no such choice.

1252
02:07:00,355 --> 02:07:02,880
You will,
sooner than you think.

1253
02:07:04,792 --> 02:07:08,058
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you.

1254
02:07:08,296 --> 02:07:09,889
Your new master.

1255
02:07:12,767 --> 02:07:15,862
The Senate's been in session all day
over this business with Spartacus.

1256
02:07:15,937 --> 02:07:19,066
We've got eight legions
and no one to lead them.

1257
02:07:19,707 --> 02:07:21,471
The minute you offer
the general's command,

1258
02:07:21,542 --> 02:07:24,137
they start wheezing
like winded mules.

1259
02:07:24,212 --> 02:07:26,578
I've seen such epidemics
before, haven't you?

1260
02:07:26,647 --> 02:07:27,637
How's your health?

1261
02:07:27,715 --> 02:07:28,739
Excellent, as you
very well know.

1262
02:07:28,816 --> 02:07:31,445
I take it the Senate's now
offering the command to me.

1263
02:07:31,519 --> 02:07:32,782
You've been
expecting it.

1264
02:07:32,854 --> 02:07:34,082
I have.

1265
02:07:34,155 --> 02:07:36,851
Have you thought how costly
my services might be?

1266
02:07:36,924 --> 02:07:38,358
We buy everything else
these days.

1267
02:07:38,426 --> 02:07:40,519
No reason why we shouldn't
be charged for patriotism.

1268
02:07:40,595 --> 02:07:42,188
What's your fee?

1269
02:07:44,632 --> 02:07:48,899
My election as First Consul,
command of all the legions of Italy,

1270
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:53,133
and the abolition of senatorial
authority over the courts.

1271
02:07:53,408 --> 02:07:54,875
Dictatorship.

1272
02:07:55,977 --> 02:07:57,137
Order.

1273
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:00,873
Let me know if my terms
are acceptable.

1274
02:08:00,948 --> 02:08:03,440
I can tell you now.
They're unacceptable.

1275
02:08:04,185 --> 02:08:07,621
For the present, perhaps, but
times change and so does the Senate.

1276
02:08:07,688 --> 02:08:09,520
When that day comes,
I shall be ready.

1277
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:10,887
Convey my respects
to your wife.

1278
02:08:10,958 --> 02:08:12,756
With pleasure.

1279
02:08:15,296 --> 02:08:17,060
He's right,
you know.

1280
02:08:17,131 --> 02:08:19,828
If something isn't done about
Spartacus, the Senate will change.

1281
02:08:19,901 --> 02:08:24,804
And Crassus will save Rome from the
slave army by assuming dictatorship.

1282
02:08:27,508 --> 02:08:30,603
But that depends on which way
Spartacus jumps.

1283
02:08:30,678 --> 02:08:32,476
Just now he's trying
to get out of Italy.

1284
02:08:32,547 --> 02:08:35,346
If he succeeds,
the crisis is over

1285
02:08:35,416 --> 02:08:38,511
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

1286
02:08:38,986 --> 02:08:42,115
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

1287
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:43,418
What?

1288
02:08:43,791 --> 02:08:46,658
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

1289
02:08:46,727 --> 02:08:48,753
I've assured them
that we won't interfere

1290
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:52,357
if they transport Spartacus
and his slaves out of Italy.

1291
02:08:54,168 --> 02:08:56,467
So now we
deal with pirates.

1292
02:08:57,105 --> 02:08:58,868
We bargain with criminals.

1293
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:03,138
Don't be so stiff-necked.
Politics is a practical profession.

1294
02:09:03,211 --> 02:09:06,840
If a criminal has what you
want, you do business with him.

1295
02:09:43,718 --> 02:09:46,016
How far are we
from Brundusium?

1296
02:09:46,587 --> 02:09:48,112
About
20 miles.

1297
02:09:49,323 --> 02:09:53,055
Our army will camp here tonight.
They're six hours behind us.

1298
02:09:53,127 --> 02:09:57,326
Patullus, ride ahead to
Brundusium. Bring Tigranes here.

1299
02:09:57,398 --> 02:10:00,334
Marco, report back
to Spartacus.

1300
02:10:00,401 --> 02:10:02,927
Tell him we camp tonight
by the sea!

1301
02:10:44,745 --> 02:10:46,736
If all goes well,

1302
02:10:46,814 --> 02:10:48,976
we can load
150 ships a day.

1303
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:51,917
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

1304
02:10:51,986 --> 02:10:53,647
That ought to
keep him busy.

1305
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:55,917
Saves me finding
someplace to sleep.

1306
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:58,459
Crixus, keep giving me
reports on Pompey.

1307
02:10:58,526 --> 02:10:59,994
There won't be
any surprises.

1308
02:11:00,061 --> 02:11:03,724
I still want patrols up to the
time we call them to board ship.

1309
02:11:03,798 --> 02:11:05,732
I'll get them together.
Spartacus,

1310
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:08,735
the harbor district in
Brundusium has food warehouses,

1311
02:11:08,803 --> 02:11:11,363
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

1312
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:13,236
The countryside's
filled with cattle.

1313
02:11:13,307 --> 02:11:15,207
We've salt
to preserve them.

1314
02:11:15,276 --> 02:11:16,641
I'll handle it.

1315
02:11:17,311 --> 02:11:21,146
Find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

1316
02:11:21,215 --> 02:11:23,081
Tigranes Levantus.

1317
02:11:23,184 --> 02:11:24,583
Ah!

1318
02:11:25,786 --> 02:11:26,879
My dear General.

1319
02:11:26,954 --> 02:11:28,183
Welcome, Tigranes.

1320
02:11:28,723 --> 02:11:32,750
No, no. You needn't look for litter
bearers to emancipate. I rode a horse.

1321
02:11:32,827 --> 02:11:35,921
Your gods, Isis and Serapis
must've been good to us.

1322
02:11:37,164 --> 02:11:40,464
The balance of the 50 million
sesterces we owe you.

1323
02:11:42,169 --> 02:11:43,660
General, I...

1324
02:11:44,372 --> 02:11:47,432
I bear a heavy burden
of evil tidings.

1325
02:11:50,611 --> 02:11:51,976
What is it?

1326
02:11:53,848 --> 02:11:56,874
Pompey and his army
has landed in Italy.

1327
02:11:57,318 --> 02:12:00,014
At the port of Rhegium
three days ago.

1328
02:12:00,087 --> 02:12:02,351
We get complete reports
on their movements.

1329
02:12:02,423 --> 02:12:04,255
But do you also know

1330
02:12:04,325 --> 02:12:07,260
that a Roman fleet
carrying Lucullus and his army

1331
02:12:07,328 --> 02:12:09,660
arrives tomorrow
at Brundusium?

1332
02:12:12,099 --> 02:12:13,294
Lucullus, here?

1333
02:12:13,367 --> 02:12:15,063
You have no ships.

1334
02:12:18,973 --> 02:12:20,998
I saw them in the harbor.

1335
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:26,410
The Cilician fleet,
out of strategic necessity,

1336
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,177
has been obliged
to withdraw.

1337
02:12:30,418 --> 02:12:31,908
Withdraw?

1338
02:12:32,153 --> 02:12:34,053
There are
no ships at all?

1339
02:12:42,096 --> 02:12:45,930
Cilician pirates can destroy
any Roman fleet that ever sailed.

1340
02:12:46,701 --> 02:12:49,261
If they run away now, it's
not because they're afraid!

1341
02:12:49,337 --> 02:12:50,668
You better give me
a better reason.

1342
02:12:50,738 --> 02:12:52,831
I'm as desolated
as you are, General.

1343
02:12:52,907 --> 02:12:54,534
Stand up. Up!

1344
02:12:56,243 --> 02:12:57,734
On your toes.

1345
02:13:01,716 --> 02:13:03,183
You'll cut the skin.

1346
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:05,549
Why did the Cilicians
run away?

1347
02:13:05,853 --> 02:13:07,378
They were paid.

1348
02:13:08,289 --> 02:13:11,190
And who paid them?
Who?

1349
02:13:12,293 --> 02:13:13,522
Crassus.

1350
02:13:17,264 --> 02:13:18,493
Crassus.

1351
02:13:19,734 --> 02:13:22,032
Crassus won't
fight us himself.

1352
02:13:22,336 --> 02:13:25,306
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

1353
02:13:25,673 --> 02:13:28,836
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

1354
02:13:28,909 --> 02:13:30,104
I don't know.

1355
02:13:30,177 --> 02:13:34,342
How can I answer, when there is no answer?
I've been betrayed just as you have.

1356
02:13:34,415 --> 02:13:36,144
There is an answer.

1357
02:13:37,384 --> 02:13:40,013
There must be an answer
to everything.

1358
02:13:41,355 --> 02:13:43,449
Five miles
from Brundusium.

1359
02:13:45,626 --> 02:13:47,151
Here's Rhegium.

1360
02:13:48,362 --> 02:13:51,525
Pompey's march must've
brought him to about here.

1361
02:13:51,632 --> 02:13:54,226
He's four days away,
maybe more.

1362
02:13:55,936 --> 02:13:58,599
Lucullus lands
at Brundusium tomorrow.

1363
02:13:59,173 --> 02:14:01,301
If we engage Lucullus,

1364
02:14:01,375 --> 02:14:04,470
Pompey will have time
to march against our rear.

1365
02:14:05,946 --> 02:14:08,279
If we turn west
to meet Pompey,

1366
02:14:10,117 --> 02:14:12,711
Lucullus will march
against our rear.

1367
02:14:14,054 --> 02:14:18,389
The only other army
in all of Italy is here.

1368
02:14:18,759 --> 02:14:19,851
Rome.

1369
02:14:21,028 --> 02:14:22,689
Yes, of course!

1370
02:14:23,197 --> 02:14:26,064
Crassus is inviting us
to march on Rome,

1371
02:14:26,133 --> 02:14:28,432
so he can take the field
against us.

1372
02:14:28,936 --> 02:14:30,700
Crassus wants us
to march on Rome?

1373
02:14:30,771 --> 02:14:31,795
He's forcing us to.

1374
02:14:31,872 --> 02:14:36,571
He knows I won't let myself be trapped
between two armies with my back to the sea.

1375
02:14:36,644 --> 02:14:39,272
He knows my only
other choice is Rome.

1376
02:14:40,815 --> 02:14:43,045
Somewhere on the way,
we meet.

1377
02:14:43,717 --> 02:14:46,710
If he beats us,
he becomes the savior of Rome,

1378
02:14:46,787 --> 02:14:49,017
and there's his final victory
over the Senate.

1379
02:14:49,089 --> 02:14:53,686
General, allow me to
redeem myself in your eyes.

1380
02:14:54,428 --> 02:14:55,691
For a small commission,

1381
02:14:55,763 --> 02:15:00,724
I can arrange for you, your
family and your leaders, of course,

1382
02:15:00,801 --> 02:15:04,032
to be smuggled out of Italy and
transported to one of the eastern countries

1383
02:15:04,104 --> 02:15:06,903
where men like you are welcome
and appreciated.

1384
02:15:06,974 --> 02:15:09,875
You can live like kings
for the rest of your lives.

1385
02:15:09,944 --> 02:15:12,037
What do you think,
General?

1386
02:15:12,379 --> 02:15:13,608
Go away.

1387
02:15:15,416 --> 02:15:16,645
Go away?

1388
02:15:20,254 --> 02:15:21,483
Go away.

1389
02:15:30,564 --> 02:15:33,090
Tell the trumpeters
to sound assembly.

1390
02:15:41,041 --> 02:15:45,035
Tonight, a Roman army lands
in the harbor of Brundusium.

1391
02:15:46,313 --> 02:15:49,249
Another army is approaching us
from the west.

1392
02:15:49,483 --> 02:15:53,716
Between them, they hope to
trap us here, against the sea.

1393
02:15:54,188 --> 02:15:57,886
The Cilician pirates have
betrayed us. We have no ships.

1394
02:15:58,025 --> 02:16:00,517
"By order of the Senate

1395
02:16:01,262 --> 02:16:04,891
"be it known that we
have this day elected

1396
02:16:04,965 --> 02:16:07,764
"Marcus Licinius Crassus

1397
02:16:08,335 --> 02:16:10,702
"First Consul of the Republic

1398
02:16:10,771 --> 02:16:14,969
"and Commander-in-Chief
of the armies of Rome. "

1399
02:16:15,376 --> 02:16:17,811
Hail Crassus!

1400
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:22,211
Rome will not allow us
to escape from Italy.

1401
02:16:23,851 --> 02:16:27,116
We have no choice but to
march against Rome herself

1402
02:16:27,888 --> 02:16:31,085
and end this war the only way
it could have ended.

1403
02:16:31,759 --> 02:16:35,354
By freeing every slave
in Italy.

1404
02:16:35,729 --> 02:16:39,359
I promise you a new Rome,

1405
02:16:40,401 --> 02:16:42,870
a new Italy and a new empire.

1406
02:16:43,537 --> 02:16:47,030
I promise the destruction
of the slave army

1407
02:16:47,107 --> 02:16:52,068
and the restoration of order
throughout all our territories.

1408
02:16:52,646 --> 02:16:56,207
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers,

1409
02:16:56,784 --> 02:16:59,753
facing a long march
and a hard fight,

1410
02:16:59,853 --> 02:17:03,085
than to be the richest
citizen of Rome,

1411
02:17:03,524 --> 02:17:06,118
fat with food
he didn't work for,

1412
02:17:06,727 --> 02:17:08,661
and surrounded by slaves.

1413
02:17:08,996 --> 02:17:11,624
I promise the living body
of Spartacus

1414
02:17:12,333 --> 02:17:15,131
for whatever punishment
you may deem fit.

1415
02:17:15,836 --> 02:17:18,328
That, or his head.

1416
02:17:20,107 --> 02:17:23,475
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

1417
02:17:24,712 --> 02:17:26,509
This I have sworn

1418
02:17:27,514 --> 02:17:30,177
in the temple that guards
their bones.

1419
02:17:31,785 --> 02:17:34,050
Hail Crassus!

1420
02:17:34,455 --> 02:17:36,753
We've traveled
a long ways together.

1421
02:17:37,524 --> 02:17:41,655
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

1422
02:17:42,429 --> 02:17:46,332
Now instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea,

1423
02:17:47,234 --> 02:17:49,328
we must fight again.

1424
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:55,067
Maybe there's no peace in this
world, for us or for anyone else.

1425
02:17:55,142 --> 02:17:56,541
I don't know.

1426
02:17:57,578 --> 02:18:01,514
But I do know
that as long as we live,

1427
02:18:02,249 --> 02:18:04,684
we must stay true
to ourselves.

1428
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:09,050
I do know that we're brothers.

1429
02:18:09,923 --> 02:18:12,017
And I know that we're free.

1430
02:18:19,266 --> 02:18:20,563
We march tonight!

1431
02:19:54,595 --> 02:19:56,461
Hail Crassus!
Hail Crassus!

1432
02:19:57,464 --> 02:19:59,364
Greetings to you,
Crassus.

1433
02:19:59,433 --> 02:20:01,959
Caius. Gentlemen.

1434
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:05,134
Have your dispositions
been made?

1435
02:20:05,205 --> 02:20:09,370
Each maniple knows its position,
sir, and exactly what's expected.

1436
02:20:09,810 --> 02:20:13,337
Every legion commander has
been given his battle orders.

1437
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:16,511
Excellent. All positions
will now be changed.

1438
02:20:16,583 --> 02:20:17,812
Changed?

1439
02:20:18,652 --> 02:20:22,282
Spartacus takes too keen an
interest in our plans, I fear.

1440
02:20:23,123 --> 02:20:26,320
New battle orders will be
issued in a short while.

1441
02:20:29,163 --> 02:20:33,122
Spartacus has every reason to
believe that he has outdistanced

1442
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:36,033
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and Lucullus.

1443
02:20:36,804 --> 02:20:41,741
However, there are passes through the
Apennine Mountains unknown to any map.

1444
02:20:43,844 --> 02:20:47,576
It may fortify your courage
to know

1445
02:20:48,248 --> 02:20:51,878
that Pompey is encamped
some 20 miles to the west

1446
02:20:52,553 --> 02:20:55,488
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south

1447
02:20:55,556 --> 02:20:57,524
by forced night march.

1448
02:20:57,591 --> 02:21:01,789
Sir, allow us to pledge you the
most glorious victory of your career.

1449
02:21:01,862 --> 02:21:02,920
Aye!

1450
02:21:03,797 --> 02:21:05,595
I'm not after glory!

1451
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,564
I'm after Spartacus.

1452
02:21:09,903 --> 02:21:12,395
And, gentlemen,
I mean to have him.

1453
02:21:13,874 --> 02:21:17,310
However, this campaign is
not alone to kill Spartacus.

1454
02:21:18,345 --> 02:21:20,973
It is to kill
the legend of Spartacus.

1455
02:21:23,417 --> 02:21:25,180
You may go, gentlemen.

1456
02:21:25,252 --> 02:21:27,380
Hail Crassus.
Hail Crassus.

1457
02:21:30,023 --> 02:21:32,219
Lentulus Batiatus
awaits Your Excellency.

1458
02:21:32,292 --> 02:21:34,283
Who?
The lanista, sir.

1459
02:21:34,962 --> 02:21:37,021
Ah! Admit him.

1460
02:21:40,367 --> 02:21:41,630
Most Blessed Highness,

1461
02:21:41,702 --> 02:21:45,138
as soon as I received your message I
hurried into your distinguished presence.

1462
02:21:45,205 --> 02:21:48,266
I'm glad you were able
to spare the time. Sit down.

1463
02:21:48,342 --> 02:21:50,367
Oh, how gracious.

1464
02:21:51,878 --> 02:21:54,245
I understand...
I'm informed

1465
02:21:55,048 --> 02:21:57,415
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

1466
02:21:57,484 --> 02:21:58,542
Yes!

1467
02:21:58,619 --> 02:22:02,521
In fact, if it isn't too
subversive to say so,

1468
02:22:02,589 --> 02:22:05,058
I made him
what he is today.

1469
02:22:05,692 --> 02:22:07,786
You're to be
congratulated.

1470
02:22:08,195 --> 02:22:11,460
You're so
admirably qualified

1471
02:22:11,999 --> 02:22:14,900
to give me what up to now
I've not been able to obtain,

1472
02:22:14,968 --> 02:22:16,902
a physical description
of Spartacus.

1473
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:18,199
Oh, yes.

1474
02:22:20,073 --> 02:22:21,666
But you saw him.

1475
02:22:22,743 --> 02:22:24,472
What?
In the ring.

1476
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,372
When?

1477
02:22:28,115 --> 02:22:31,744
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

1478
02:22:33,687 --> 02:22:34,779
What!

1479
02:22:35,789 --> 02:22:38,087
I trust they're both
in good health.

1480
02:22:38,158 --> 02:22:41,253
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the negro.

1481
02:22:41,328 --> 02:22:42,761
I remember the negro.

1482
02:22:42,829 --> 02:22:46,425
You had good cause to.
If I... If I may say so,

1483
02:22:46,967 --> 02:22:49,595
a brilliant dagger thrust,
difficult angle.

1484
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:50,796
Spartacus
was the opponent?

1485
02:22:50,871 --> 02:22:51,861
Yes.

1486
02:22:54,308 --> 02:22:56,173
What did he
look like?

1487
02:22:56,977 --> 02:22:59,537
That's a matter of some
importance to Your Highness?

1488
02:22:59,613 --> 02:23:03,447
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

1489
02:23:04,718 --> 02:23:08,484
We're both Roman patriots. You're
a great one. I, of course, smaller.

1490
02:23:08,555 --> 02:23:11,115
We both believe
in Roman fair play.

1491
02:23:11,925 --> 02:23:13,188
You want
something from me.

1492
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:16,787
I would be lacking
in respect for my conscience,

1493
02:23:16,863 --> 02:23:19,093
if I did not say that I
wish something from you.

1494
02:23:19,166 --> 02:23:20,531
Name your price.

1495
02:23:21,468 --> 02:23:23,300
If... Uh, no.

1496
02:23:23,737 --> 02:23:26,365
When you win
your victory tomorrow,

1497
02:23:26,807 --> 02:23:29,276
presumably the survivors
will be auctioned off

1498
02:23:29,343 --> 02:23:33,040
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

1499
02:23:33,947 --> 02:23:36,348
Could not the agent
for that sale

1500
02:23:36,416 --> 02:23:40,649
be he who shares this tiny
moment of history with Your Honor?

1501
02:23:42,889 --> 02:23:46,724
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

1502
02:23:47,427 --> 02:23:50,124
In return,
you will remain here

1503
02:23:50,197 --> 02:23:52,859
until after the battle and aid
me in identifying Spartacus.

1504
02:23:52,933 --> 02:23:54,457
After the battle?
Mm-hmm.

1505
02:23:54,534 --> 02:23:57,128
You misunderstand me.
I'm a civilian.

1506
02:23:57,437 --> 02:24:00,873
I'm even more of a civilian
than most civilians.

1507
02:24:01,641 --> 02:24:03,439
If you wish to remain so,

1508
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:08,038
I strongly advise you to stay
here and be our guest. Guard!

1509
02:24:11,118 --> 02:24:12,381
Hmm?

1510
02:24:14,021 --> 02:24:18,651
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus,

1511
02:24:19,793 --> 02:24:24,025
what if it is Spartacus who crosses
the battlefield looking for you?

1512
02:24:26,366 --> 02:24:30,735
In such circumstances, I have
no doubt you will be helping him.

1513
02:24:32,038 --> 02:24:35,008
This fellow remains with us
until after the battle.

1514
02:24:35,075 --> 02:24:38,374
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.

1515
02:26:11,738 --> 02:26:14,435
Mommy? Mommy?

1516
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:19,135
When do we go home?

1517
02:26:24,050 --> 02:26:25,746
Go to sleep, dear.

1518
02:26:59,553 --> 02:27:01,020
No pains yet?

1519
02:27:01,855 --> 02:27:04,551
He's a bad child.
He hits me with his fists.

1520
02:27:04,624 --> 02:27:07,617
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?

1521
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:09,554
Can you feel it?

1522
02:27:11,331 --> 02:27:12,730
No, I don't.

1523
02:27:13,266 --> 02:27:15,792
I hope he waits
till we get to Rome.

1524
02:27:19,673 --> 02:27:20,765
Rome.

1525
02:27:22,909 --> 02:27:25,037
They've never
beaten us yet.

1526
02:27:27,614 --> 02:27:28,638
No.

1527
02:27:31,551 --> 02:27:33,178
But no matter how many times
we beat them,

1528
02:27:33,253 --> 02:27:37,383
they still seem to have
another army to send against us.

1529
02:27:38,458 --> 02:27:39,858
And another.

1530
02:27:42,996 --> 02:27:46,261
Varinia, it just seems like
we've started something

1531
02:27:48,034 --> 02:27:49,798
that has no ending.

1532
02:27:49,869 --> 02:27:52,964
If it ended tomorrow,
it would be worth it.

1533
02:27:58,712 --> 02:28:00,111
Oh, Varinia,

1534
02:28:02,549 --> 02:28:04,278
don't make me weak.

1535
02:28:05,251 --> 02:28:07,584
You're strong enough
to be weak.

1536
02:28:08,455 --> 02:28:09,854
Oh, Varinia.

1537
02:28:11,157 --> 02:28:12,557
Oh, Varinia,

1538
02:28:13,093 --> 02:28:15,289
I love you
more than my life.

1539
02:28:17,564 --> 02:28:21,091
Yet, sometimes, even with
you sleeping beside me

1540
02:28:23,436 --> 02:28:25,029
I feel so alone.

1541
02:28:27,173 --> 02:28:31,542
I imagine a god
for slaves and I pray.

1542
02:28:33,346 --> 02:28:35,144
What do you
pray for?

1543
02:28:37,217 --> 02:28:39,811
I pray for a son
who'll be born free.

1544
02:28:41,721 --> 02:28:43,747
I pray for
the same thing.

1545
02:28:49,029 --> 02:28:51,224
Take care of my son,
Varinia.

1546
02:28:52,699 --> 02:28:54,633
And if he never knows me,

1547
02:28:54,701 --> 02:28:58,000
tell him who I was
and what we dreamed of.

1548
02:28:59,072 --> 02:29:01,939
Tell him the truth. There will
be others to tell him lies.

1549
02:29:02,008 --> 02:29:04,170
I can't live without you,
Spartacus.

1550
02:29:04,244 --> 02:29:07,043
Varinia,
Varinia.

1551
02:29:08,682 --> 02:29:09,944
Varinia.

1552
02:29:15,088 --> 02:29:19,616
Varinia, for you and me
there can be no farewells.

1553
02:29:24,931 --> 02:29:28,731
As long as one of us lives,
we all live.

1554
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:33,003
I felt it.
Did you feel it?

1555
02:29:33,373 --> 02:29:34,636
Yes, I did.

1556
02:29:34,708 --> 02:29:36,676
That was so strong.
Does it hurt you?

1557
02:29:36,743 --> 02:29:37,767
No.

1558
02:29:37,844 --> 02:29:39,573
That was so strong.

1559
02:29:41,748 --> 02:29:44,581
Oh, Varinia,
Varinia, Varinia.

1560
02:36:02,095 --> 02:36:04,325
Lucullus and Pompey.

1561
02:39:43,282 --> 02:39:45,307
Have we
a count of prisoners?

1562
02:39:45,384 --> 02:39:47,978
We haven't made
the final count, sir.

1563
02:39:48,054 --> 02:39:51,421
I bring a message
from your master,

1564
02:39:51,490 --> 02:39:54,892
Marcus Licinius Crassus,

1565
02:39:54,961 --> 02:39:56,792
Commander of Italy.

1566
02:39:57,296 --> 02:40:01,165
By command of His
Most Merciful Excellency,

1567
02:40:01,233 --> 02:40:03,793
your lives are to be spared.

1568
02:40:07,073 --> 02:40:11,066
Slaves you were
and slaves you remain.

1569
02:40:11,577 --> 02:40:16,447
But the terrible penalty of
crucifixion has been set aside

1570
02:40:16,882 --> 02:40:21,286
on the single condition
that you identify the body

1571
02:40:21,354 --> 02:40:25,814
or the living person
of the slave called Spartacus.

1572
02:40:38,537 --> 02:40:41,200
I'm Spartacus!

1573
02:40:42,942 --> 02:40:44,569
I'm Spartacus.

1574
02:40:44,777 --> 02:40:47,645
I'm Spartacus!

1575
02:40:47,713 --> 02:40:49,181
I'm Spartacus!
I'm Spartacus!

1576
02:40:49,248 --> 02:40:53,813
I'm Spartacus!

1577
02:41:00,159 --> 02:41:02,252
I'm Spartacus.

1578
02:41:04,029 --> 02:41:05,588
I'm Spartacus.

1579
02:41:26,118 --> 02:41:29,611
Forgive me for being one of
the last to congratulate you.

1580
02:41:29,688 --> 02:41:32,180
There's an ugly rumor
going round the camp

1581
02:41:32,258 --> 02:41:35,193
that the prisoners
are to be crucified.

1582
02:41:36,595 --> 02:41:38,063
That is true.

1583
02:41:38,898 --> 02:41:41,298
Perhaps this is the moment
to remind Your Highness

1584
02:41:41,367 --> 02:41:44,826
that you promised me I could be
the agent in their auctioning.

1585
02:41:44,904 --> 02:41:48,340
You promised Spartacus to me!
Where is he?

1586
02:41:48,841 --> 02:41:52,505
In return, I promised you the sale of
the survivors and there will be none!

1587
02:42:17,369 --> 02:42:18,996
But
it's Varinia.

1588
02:42:19,071 --> 02:42:22,132
Yes, I remember.
You're the woman of Spartacus?

1589
02:42:22,942 --> 02:42:24,409
I'm his wife.

1590
02:42:25,311 --> 02:42:27,177
And this is
his child?

1591
02:42:29,081 --> 02:42:30,139
Yes.

1592
02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:32,979
Where is Spartacus?

1593
02:42:37,256 --> 02:42:38,348
Dead.

1594
02:42:39,792 --> 02:42:41,726
Did you
see him killed?

1595
02:42:45,831 --> 02:42:47,060
Yes.

1596
02:42:48,868 --> 02:42:50,335
You're lying.

1597
02:42:51,537 --> 02:42:52,970
Where is he?

1598
02:42:57,443 --> 02:42:59,878
At least here is someone
worth selling, Your Enormity.

1599
02:42:59,945 --> 02:43:02,778
I'll even take the child
as an investment.

1600
02:43:03,916 --> 02:43:05,145
How many women
have been taken?

1601
02:43:05,251 --> 02:43:06,445
Under 40, sir.

1602
02:43:06,519 --> 02:43:09,613
Those who weren't killed have run
off to the hills with their children.

1603
02:43:09,688 --> 02:43:11,884
You may sell all the others
but not this woman.

1604
02:43:11,957 --> 02:43:15,655
You haven't seen the others.
They're of surpassing ugliness!

1605
02:43:15,728 --> 02:43:17,252
A genius wouldn't be able
to sell them.

1606
02:43:17,329 --> 02:43:19,662
Flog that scoundrel
out of camp.

1607
02:43:20,266 --> 02:43:23,861
This woman and her child are to
be conveyed to my house in Rome.

1608
02:43:37,783 --> 02:43:39,683
Halt them!
Halt!

1609
02:43:44,757 --> 02:43:46,350
Antoninus?

1610
02:44:04,310 --> 02:44:05,538
Tribune!

1611
02:44:11,283 --> 02:44:14,583
Slaves are to be crucified
along the roadside

1612
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:18,486
the full distance between
here and the gates of Rome.

1613
02:44:22,861 --> 02:44:24,955
Hold this man
till the end.

1614
02:44:28,434 --> 02:44:30,095
And that man, too.

1615
02:44:36,875 --> 02:44:38,741
March on.
March on!

1616
02:45:32,831 --> 02:45:35,494
I've more stripes
than a zebra.

1617
02:45:35,734 --> 02:45:40,832
Every time I touch my wounds,
they sing like larks.

1618
02:45:42,241 --> 02:45:46,473
But in spite of that, I found something
I never had before, with all my wealth.

1619
02:45:46,545 --> 02:45:47,808
What is that?

1620
02:45:48,580 --> 02:45:51,778
Don't laugh at me, but I
believe it to be dignity.

1621
02:45:52,051 --> 02:45:56,283
In Rome, dignity shortens life
even more surely than disease.

1622
02:45:56,622 --> 02:45:59,853
The gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise.

1623
02:45:59,925 --> 02:46:01,393
You think so?

1624
02:46:01,827 --> 02:46:05,627
Anyone who believes I'll turn
informer for nothing is a fool.

1625
02:46:06,365 --> 02:46:08,925
I bore the whip
without complaint.

1626
02:46:09,001 --> 02:46:12,528
Indeed, that sounds like
a bad attack of dignity.

1627
02:46:13,005 --> 02:46:15,565
I hope this
will not deflect you

1628
02:46:15,641 --> 02:46:17,871
from the revenge you were
going to take on Crassus.

1629
02:46:17,943 --> 02:46:20,503
On the contrary, it only
strengthens my resolve.

1630
02:46:20,579 --> 02:46:23,276
That's enough.
I'm glad to learn that.

1631
02:46:25,517 --> 02:46:29,318
This woman, Varinia, is in his
house. All Rome knows about it.

1632
02:46:29,388 --> 02:46:34,019
Malicious tongues even say that
he's in love for the first time.

1633
02:46:34,827 --> 02:46:36,795
Yes! Oh.

1634
02:46:38,063 --> 02:46:41,727
I noticed a strange look in
his eye when he first saw her.

1635
02:46:41,934 --> 02:46:46,838
It would take a great woman to make
Crassus fall out of love with himself.

1636
02:46:47,439 --> 02:46:48,998
I'll be honest with you.

1637
02:46:49,074 --> 02:46:52,533
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

1638
02:46:52,611 --> 02:46:55,979
Dignity and honesty in one
afternoon. I hardly recognize you.

1639
02:46:57,149 --> 02:46:58,844
But she is
an impossible woman.

1640
02:46:58,917 --> 02:46:59,941
Beautiful?

1641
02:47:00,018 --> 02:47:02,112
Beautiful?
Well, beautiful.

1642
02:47:02,421 --> 02:47:05,220
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

1643
02:47:05,290 --> 02:47:07,316
Proud?
Proud, proud.

1644
02:47:07,392 --> 02:47:12,296
You feel that she would surrender
to the right man which is irritating.

1645
02:47:13,298 --> 02:47:15,528
I like Crassus.

1646
02:47:15,601 --> 02:47:19,594
Let's save him from his agony.
Let's steal this woman.

1647
02:47:20,706 --> 02:47:23,107
Steal the woman? Why?

1648
02:47:23,175 --> 02:47:25,576
I can no longer hurt Crassus
in the Senate

1649
02:47:25,644 --> 02:47:29,376
but I can hurt him where he'll
feel it most, in his pride.

1650
02:47:29,448 --> 02:47:31,610
Attack our enemy
from within.

1651
02:47:31,683 --> 02:47:34,414
The scheme is excellent, but
I hope you're not suggesting

1652
02:47:34,486 --> 02:47:36,648
that I steal the woman.

1653
02:47:36,722 --> 02:47:38,315
Yes!

1654
02:47:39,091 --> 02:47:42,254
Buy some horses
and a cart with a canopy.

1655
02:47:42,327 --> 02:47:44,455
Bring her here by nightfall.

1656
02:47:44,696 --> 02:47:45,993
Oh, no.

1657
02:47:46,265 --> 02:47:49,894
Add courage
to your newfound virtues.

1658
02:47:52,104 --> 02:47:55,870
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

1659
02:47:58,177 --> 02:47:59,701
Half a million?

1660
02:48:03,048 --> 02:48:05,483
Well, Crassus

1661
02:48:05,551 --> 02:48:09,078
does seem to dwindle
in the mind, but...

1662
02:48:09,388 --> 02:48:12,687
Let's reduce him further.
A round million!

1663
02:48:13,392 --> 02:48:14,723
A million.

1664
02:48:15,594 --> 02:48:18,586
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

1665
02:48:19,031 --> 02:48:21,193
With a lesser sum,
I have.

1666
02:48:27,806 --> 02:48:32,073
Forgive the intrusion. I'm not
in the habit of coming uninvited.

1667
02:48:32,144 --> 02:48:34,112
You've always been
welcome here.

1668
02:48:34,179 --> 02:48:35,169
As a pupil.

1669
02:48:40,385 --> 02:48:41,785
You're not alone.

1670
02:48:42,354 --> 02:48:43,788
No.

1671
02:48:44,790 --> 02:48:47,088
This time
you've come to teach.

1672
02:48:49,428 --> 02:48:51,294
You've joined Crassus?

1673
02:48:52,431 --> 02:48:54,422
Am I arrested?
No.

1674
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:58,600
But I must ask you to come with
me to the Senate immediately.

1675
02:48:59,838 --> 02:49:04,241
What I do, I do not
for myself but for Rome.

1676
02:49:04,309 --> 02:49:07,575
Rome? Poor,
helpless Rome.

1677
02:49:08,480 --> 02:49:12,474
Let's go and hear more
about Rome from Crassus.

1678
02:49:17,723 --> 02:49:20,158
Did you truly believe
500 years of Rome

1679
02:49:20,225 --> 02:49:23,752
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

1680
02:49:27,332 --> 02:49:31,394
Already the bodies of 6,000
crucified slaves

1681
02:49:31,470 --> 02:49:33,233
line the Appian Way.

1682
02:49:33,872 --> 02:49:36,842
Tomorrow the last of their
companions will fight to the death

1683
02:49:36,909 --> 02:49:40,402
in the temple of my fathers,
as a sacrifice to them.

1684
02:49:40,946 --> 02:49:44,678
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble

1685
02:49:44,750 --> 02:49:49,654
if they falter one instant
in loyalty to the new order.

1686
02:49:50,422 --> 02:49:52,686
The enemies of the state
are known.

1687
02:49:53,125 --> 02:49:56,891
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

1688
02:49:57,329 --> 02:50:01,095
In every city and province, lists
of the disloyal have been compiled.

1689
02:50:01,900 --> 02:50:06,463
Tomorrow they will learn the
cost of their terrible folly,

1690
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:09,630
their treason.

1691
02:50:10,642 --> 02:50:15,045
Where does my name appear on the
list of disloyal enemies of the state?

1692
02:50:16,181 --> 02:50:17,342
First.

1693
02:50:19,718 --> 02:50:23,120
Yet, upon you I have
no desire for vengeance.

1694
02:50:24,189 --> 02:50:26,681
Your property
shall not be touched.

1695
02:50:26,825 --> 02:50:30,125
You will retain the rank
and title of Roman senator.

1696
02:50:30,462 --> 02:50:31,657
A house...

1697
02:50:32,631 --> 02:50:36,158
A farmhouse in Picenum has
been provided for your exile.

1698
02:50:36,902 --> 02:50:39,303
You may take your women
with you.

1699
02:50:40,672 --> 02:50:44,871
Why am I to be left
so conspicuously alive?

1700
02:50:45,644 --> 02:50:48,704
Your followers are deluded
enough to trust you.

1701
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:52,546
I intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for the sake of their own good,

1702
02:50:52,618 --> 02:50:55,610
their peaceful
and profitable future.

1703
02:50:56,188 --> 02:50:59,715
From time to time thereafter, I may
find it useful to bring you back to Rome

1704
02:50:59,791 --> 02:51:01,851
to continue your duty to her,

1705
02:51:01,927 --> 02:51:06,296
to calm the envious spirit
and the troubled mind.

1706
02:51:06,965 --> 02:51:11,903
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order,

1707
02:51:12,304 --> 02:51:14,568
and trust the gods!

1708
02:51:18,677 --> 02:51:20,042
You may go.

1709
02:51:31,523 --> 02:51:32,957
Halt!

1710
02:52:19,271 --> 02:52:21,603
Why hide behind
that stola, hmm?

1711
02:52:27,446 --> 02:52:28,936
That's better.

1712
02:52:29,514 --> 02:52:32,450
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

1713
02:52:33,051 --> 02:52:37,511
You, above all people, should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly.

1714
02:52:37,589 --> 02:52:38,920
Come here.

1715
02:52:53,872 --> 02:52:58,309
This belonged to a queen,
the Queen of Persia.

1716
02:52:59,978 --> 02:53:01,343
It's heavy.

1717
02:53:03,648 --> 02:53:06,379
In time you will
wear it lightly enough.

1718
02:53:19,498 --> 02:53:20,760
Sit down.

1719
02:53:24,402 --> 02:53:27,565
Will you have
some squab and honey?

1720
02:53:29,074 --> 02:53:30,234
No.

1721
02:53:30,842 --> 02:53:32,208
You'll enjoy it.

1722
02:53:33,979 --> 02:53:35,776
And a piece
of melon?

1723
02:53:40,418 --> 02:53:42,410
And some wine,
of course.

1724
02:53:44,389 --> 02:53:45,481
Eat.

1725
02:53:51,563 --> 02:53:55,158
I did not command you
to eat, I invited you.

1726
02:53:57,369 --> 02:54:01,772
You find the richness of your
surroundings makes conversation difficult?

1727
02:54:04,709 --> 02:54:06,200
Why am I
here?

1728
02:54:10,148 --> 02:54:11,639
Good question.

1729
02:54:12,651 --> 02:54:14,380
A woman's question.

1730
02:54:15,587 --> 02:54:19,046
I wish the answer could be
as good and straightforward.

1731
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:24,759
The infant,
it thrives?

1732
02:54:25,931 --> 02:54:27,057
He thrives.

1733
02:54:27,132 --> 02:54:31,728
I purchased a wet nurse for him,
yesterday. I hope the milk agrees with him.

1734
02:54:34,406 --> 02:54:35,999
I sent her away.

1735
02:54:36,841 --> 02:54:39,333
I prefer to nurse
the child myself.

1736
02:54:40,412 --> 02:54:42,312
I'm not sure
I approve.

1737
02:54:43,982 --> 02:54:46,110
It ties you
to the old life.

1738
02:54:47,152 --> 02:54:50,212
I want you to begin to
look forward to the new.

1739
02:54:52,991 --> 02:54:55,517
I don't care
about my new life here.

1740
02:54:56,361 --> 02:54:59,524
You care about the life
of your child, don't you?

1741
02:55:00,532 --> 02:55:03,058
Why do you threaten me
with my baby?

1742
02:55:03,668 --> 02:55:06,638
I belong to you. You can
take me anytime you wish.

1743
02:55:06,705 --> 02:55:09,367
But I don't want
to take you.

1744
02:55:10,609 --> 02:55:12,338
I want you to give.

1745
02:55:15,213 --> 02:55:17,238
I want your love,
Varinia.

1746
02:55:20,819 --> 02:55:24,915
You think by threatening to kill
my child you'll make me love you?

1747
02:55:25,223 --> 02:55:28,284
I did not threaten
to kill your child.

1748
02:55:35,533 --> 02:55:38,503
I'm sorry, Varinia.

1749
02:55:45,110 --> 02:55:47,306
One shouldn't grieve
forever.

1750
02:55:48,513 --> 02:55:51,540
I'm not grieving,
I'm remembering.

1751
02:55:52,550 --> 02:55:54,985
Do I interfere
with your memories?

1752
02:55:56,354 --> 02:55:57,549
Oh, no.

1753
02:56:00,458 --> 02:56:05,226
You tread the ridge between truth and
insult with the skill of a mountain goat.

1754
02:56:05,630 --> 02:56:06,722
Well.

1755
02:56:09,100 --> 02:56:12,468
What do you remember, when
you think about Spartacus?

1756
02:56:14,939 --> 02:56:16,965
It doesn't distress you
to talk about him?

1757
02:56:17,475 --> 02:56:18,499
No.

1758
02:56:20,278 --> 02:56:21,644
Well, then,

1759
02:56:23,782 --> 02:56:28,082
what sort of a man
was he, really?

1760
02:56:33,291 --> 02:56:37,455
He was a man who began
all alone, like an animal.

1761
02:56:38,930 --> 02:56:40,421
Yet on the day he died,

1762
02:56:40,498 --> 02:56:44,230
thousands and thousands would
gladly have died in his place.

1763
02:56:46,037 --> 02:56:48,700
What was he?
Was he a god?

1764
02:56:50,241 --> 02:56:51,834
He wasn't a god.

1765
02:56:53,044 --> 02:56:56,605
He was a simple man.
A slave.

1766
02:57:00,719 --> 02:57:02,118
I loved him.

1767
02:57:02,821 --> 02:57:05,290
He was an outlaw!
A murderer!

1768
02:57:05,357 --> 02:57:09,088
An enemy to everything fine
and decent that Rome ever built!

1769
02:57:10,028 --> 02:57:11,894
Damn you!
You tell me.

1770
02:57:12,797 --> 02:57:14,026
Why did you love him?

1771
02:57:14,632 --> 02:57:16,066
I can't tell you.

1772
02:57:16,201 --> 02:57:19,364
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

1773
02:57:20,739 --> 02:57:23,299
But I want to understand.

1774
02:57:24,242 --> 02:57:28,042
Don't you see?
I must understand.

1775
02:57:36,888 --> 02:57:39,289
You're afraid of him,
aren't you?

1776
02:57:43,661 --> 02:57:45,789
That's why
you want his wife,

1777
02:57:46,464 --> 02:57:49,491
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

1778
02:57:51,836 --> 02:57:55,466
When you're so afraid,
nothing can help.

1779
02:57:56,307 --> 02:57:57,536
Nothing.

1780
02:58:06,351 --> 02:58:07,819
We shall see.

1781
02:58:32,577 --> 02:58:34,773
Could we have won,
Spartacus?

1782
02:58:37,082 --> 02:58:38,982
Could we ever
have won?

1783
02:58:43,621 --> 02:58:46,352
Just by fighting them,
we won something.

1784
02:58:49,828 --> 02:58:52,456
When just one man says
"No, I won't,"

1785
02:58:53,198 --> 02:58:54,961
Rome begins to fear.

1786
02:59:00,405 --> 02:59:03,033
We were tens of thousands
who said no.

1787
02:59:04,142 --> 02:59:06,167
That was
the wonder of it.

1788
02:59:07,011 --> 02:59:10,277
To have seen slaves lift
their heads from the dust,

1789
02:59:12,984 --> 02:59:17,649
to see them rise from
their knees, stand tall

1790
02:59:20,458 --> 02:59:22,449
with a song on their lips,

1791
02:59:24,295 --> 02:59:25,695
to hear them

1792
02:59:27,265 --> 02:59:30,633
storm through
the mountains shouting,

1793
02:59:33,271 --> 02:59:35,763
to hear them sing
along the plains.

1794
02:59:39,511 --> 02:59:41,308
And now they're dead.

1795
02:59:44,282 --> 02:59:45,374
Dead.

1796
02:59:52,323 --> 02:59:53,518
Varinia

1797
02:59:57,395 --> 02:59:58,487
dead.

1798
03:00:02,834 --> 03:00:04,302
And the baby.

1799
03:00:17,916 --> 03:00:19,315
All of them.

1800
03:00:30,528 --> 03:00:32,656
Are you afraid to die,
Spartacus?

1801
03:00:33,598 --> 03:00:34,895
Hmm.

1802
03:00:36,100 --> 03:00:38,399
No more than
I was to be born.

1803
03:00:49,714 --> 03:00:51,239
Are you afraid?

1804
03:00:54,852 --> 03:00:55,911
Yes.

1805
03:01:09,100 --> 03:01:10,500
Hail Consul!

1806
03:01:11,202 --> 03:01:12,795
Guard, fall in.

1807
03:01:13,871 --> 03:01:15,134
Where are
the gladiators?

1808
03:01:15,206 --> 03:01:16,765
Over there,
sir.

1809
03:01:41,199 --> 03:01:44,965
Antoninus, the night passes
slowly, doesn't it?

1810
03:01:56,581 --> 03:01:57,912
Spartacus.

1811
03:02:03,788 --> 03:02:07,918
You are he,
aren't you?

1812
03:02:11,396 --> 03:02:15,162
Gladiator,
I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

1813
03:02:18,770 --> 03:02:22,934
You must answer
when I speak to you.

1814
03:02:46,497 --> 03:02:47,829
Centurion!

1815
03:02:50,902 --> 03:02:54,600
Let them fight now.
Unchain them.

1816
03:02:54,806 --> 03:02:59,106
The entire city's been told they'll fight
tomorrow in the temple of your ancestors.

1817
03:02:59,177 --> 03:03:02,169
They will fight now
for me. Here!

1818
03:03:02,714 --> 03:03:06,115
And to the death. And the
victor shall be crucified.

1819
03:03:07,085 --> 03:03:10,020
We will test this myth
of slave brotherhood.

1820
03:03:10,521 --> 03:03:11,989
Unchain them!

1821
03:03:19,964 --> 03:03:21,455
Form a circle.

1822
03:03:38,349 --> 03:03:40,477
Don't give them the
pleasure of a contest.

1823
03:03:40,551 --> 03:03:42,349
I'll kill you
on the first rush.

1824
03:03:42,420 --> 03:03:43,410
I won't let them
crucify you.

1825
03:03:43,521 --> 03:03:45,819
It's my last order.
Obey it.

1826
03:03:45,890 --> 03:03:47,415
Let them begin.

1827
03:04:24,262 --> 03:04:26,458
I won't let them
crucify you.

1828
03:04:37,375 --> 03:04:40,037
Do you realize how long
it takes to die on a cross?

1829
03:04:40,111 --> 03:04:41,408
I don't care!

1830
03:04:58,563 --> 03:05:00,429
Forgive me,
Antoninus.

1831
03:05:10,908 --> 03:05:15,175
I love you, Spartacus,
as I loved my own father.

1832
03:05:15,847 --> 03:05:20,216
I love you like my son
that I'll never see.

1833
03:05:24,889 --> 03:05:26,288
Go to sleep.

1834
03:06:00,992 --> 03:06:02,755
Here's your victory.

1835
03:06:05,096 --> 03:06:06,689
He'll come back.

1836
03:06:07,331 --> 03:06:10,028
He'll come back
and he'll be millions!

1837
03:06:14,639 --> 03:06:17,073
I wonder what
Spartacus would say

1838
03:06:17,975 --> 03:06:21,377
if he knew that the woman,
Varinia, and her child

1839
03:06:22,313 --> 03:06:24,611
are slaves
in my household?

1840
03:06:37,728 --> 03:06:38,786
Yes.

1841
03:06:42,066 --> 03:06:43,397
Spartacus.

1842
03:06:48,105 --> 03:06:49,505
Crucify him!

1843
03:07:08,259 --> 03:07:10,751
I want no grave for him.
No marker.

1844
03:07:10,962 --> 03:07:14,591
His body's to be burned and
his ashes scattered in secret.

1845
03:07:24,141 --> 03:07:26,167
Did you fear him,
Crassus?

1846
03:07:26,711 --> 03:07:29,942
Not when I fought him.
I knew he could be beaten.

1847
03:07:31,048 --> 03:07:34,780
But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

1848
03:07:34,852 --> 03:07:35,876
Me?

1849
03:07:35,953 --> 03:07:38,547
Yes, my dear Caesar.
You!

1850
03:07:40,791 --> 03:07:44,318
I don't see the letter here
to the leader of the Senate.

1851
03:07:44,629 --> 03:07:48,087
Oh, yes. Julia, I don't like
the sound of weeping.

1852
03:07:48,165 --> 03:07:50,657
This is a happy house.
Please stop.

1853
03:07:52,169 --> 03:07:55,298
Oh, there you are. Go away,
Julia! Where have you been?

1854
03:07:55,373 --> 03:07:57,842
The city is full of Crassus'
legions. We've been hiding.

1855
03:07:57,908 --> 03:08:00,400
I don't know Rome
as well as I know Capua.

1856
03:08:00,478 --> 03:08:02,571
They're arresting
everyone.

1857
03:08:12,390 --> 03:08:16,588
So this is the woman it took Crassus
eight Roman legions to conquer.

1858
03:08:16,660 --> 03:08:19,960
I wish I had time to make
your acquaintance, my dear.

1859
03:08:20,031 --> 03:08:24,968
Unfortunately, we all have to make
journeys to different destinations.

1860
03:08:25,436 --> 03:08:27,199
Where are we going?

1861
03:08:28,005 --> 03:08:30,998
You're going to Aquitania. The
governor's one of my innumerable cousins.

1862
03:08:31,075 --> 03:08:34,477
Here's a senatorial pass. It's
valid in all the known world.

1863
03:08:34,545 --> 03:08:36,513
Why do I have
to go to Aquitania?

1864
03:08:36,580 --> 03:08:37,570
'Cause I asked you to.

1865
03:08:38,783 --> 03:08:41,274
It's very good of you,
Gracchus, but I...

1866
03:08:41,352 --> 03:08:45,220
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.

1867
03:08:45,289 --> 03:08:46,723
Two million?

1868
03:08:47,625 --> 03:08:51,288
Here. Articles of freedom
for the woman.

1869
03:08:51,629 --> 03:08:55,895
And here's a smaller document
that I've prepared for the child,

1870
03:08:55,966 --> 03:08:57,696
befitting its size.

1871
03:09:03,941 --> 03:09:05,306
Where are you going?

1872
03:09:05,376 --> 03:09:06,434
Hmm?

1873
03:09:07,645 --> 03:09:09,408
Oh, to Picenum.

1874
03:09:09,747 --> 03:09:12,216
Picenum? That's the
dreariest town in Italy.

1875
03:09:12,283 --> 03:09:14,274
Will you please leave me?

1876
03:09:16,187 --> 03:09:20,283
Come with us. See to it that
I don't misuse the money.

1877
03:09:20,391 --> 03:09:22,723
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a senator.

1878
03:09:22,793 --> 03:09:25,956
Will you please go
before the soldiers come here?

1879
03:09:31,335 --> 03:09:32,530
Oh!

1880
03:09:33,337 --> 03:09:36,398
This would really
make Crassus jealous.

1881
03:09:38,442 --> 03:09:40,433
Go and make my joy
complete.

1882
03:09:40,511 --> 03:09:43,572
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.

1883
03:09:52,456 --> 03:09:55,119
Well. Prettier.

1884
03:10:15,045 --> 03:10:16,172
Halt!

1885
03:10:21,719 --> 03:10:23,744
Identify yourselves,
please.

1886
03:10:23,821 --> 03:10:26,187
Lentulus Batiatus.

1887
03:10:26,257 --> 03:10:28,657
Climb down, please,
and identify yourselves.

1888
03:10:28,726 --> 03:10:30,421
I object
to that tone.

1889
03:10:30,494 --> 03:10:31,757
I've got
my orders.

1890
03:10:31,829 --> 03:10:34,662
Come down and
identify yourselves, please.

1891
03:10:42,173 --> 03:10:45,836
As I told you, I'm Lentulus
Batiatus, the lanista from Capua.

1892
03:10:45,910 --> 03:10:49,312
This...
My sister-in-law.

1893
03:10:52,983 --> 03:10:54,815
Lady, please.

1894
03:10:55,920 --> 03:11:00,380
She's traveling with
her child to Aquitania

1895
03:11:00,457 --> 03:11:02,790
on a senatorial pass.

1896
03:11:02,860 --> 03:11:04,384
Take a look through his baggage.

1897
03:11:04,461 --> 03:11:06,157
Not a word,
please.

1898
03:11:12,903 --> 03:11:14,530
What did you say?

1899
03:11:24,848 --> 03:11:26,714
Oh, Spartacus.

1900
03:11:57,214 --> 03:11:59,183
Tell the lady
no loitering's allowed.

1901
03:11:59,250 --> 03:12:00,239
Instantly.

1902
03:12:00,351 --> 03:12:01,841
Move on.
Yes.

1903
03:12:06,357 --> 03:12:07,984
This is your son.

1904
03:12:10,394 --> 03:12:13,762
He's free, Spartacus!
Free!

1905
03:12:17,067 --> 03:12:18,433
He's free.

1906
03:12:20,104 --> 03:12:21,833
He's free.

1907
03:12:24,708 --> 03:12:28,804
He'll remember you, Spartacus,
because I'll tell him.

1908
03:12:30,614 --> 03:12:34,141
I'll tell him who his father
was and what he dreamed of.

1909
03:12:37,288 --> 03:12:40,587
Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.

1910
03:12:42,026 --> 03:12:43,823
Oh, my love,
my life.

1911
03:12:46,664 --> 03:12:48,859
Please die, die.

1912
03:12:49,466 --> 03:12:52,095
Please, please die,
my love.

1913
03:12:52,870 --> 03:12:54,929
Oh, God,
why can't you die!

1914
03:12:55,005 --> 03:12:56,996
Come on. Come on.

1915
03:13:13,090 --> 03:13:15,582
Goodbye, my love,
my life.

1916
03:13:16,093 --> 03:13:17,925
Goodbye, goodbye.
