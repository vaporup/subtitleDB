Don't record any more
messages on my alarm clock.

36
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:01,024
Why not?

37
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,777
I'll start to think we're
married or something.

38
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,695
Don't ever say that word.

39
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:10,283
I'll never bring you chicken soup
and fuck your brains out again.

40
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:16,164
- How's your cold?
- Still there. How about yours?

41
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:20,210
- You definitely took my mind off it.
- Really?

42
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:23,379
Yes!

43
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,430
Juliana here.

44
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:36,226
Hi, Rayna. I missed my
audition, I lost my head!

45
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,269
Listen, I have to go.

46
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,396
I'm with David.

47
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:49,697
Help yourself to whatever you want.
Set the alarm before you go. And...

48
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,659
You are the greatest.

49
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:58,706
- Bye, honey!
- Bye, honey. I'll call you later.

50
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,166
When?

51
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:03,586
- When?
- Soon!

52
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,986
<i>I know you say</i>

53
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,906
<i>Maybe some day</i>

54
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,952
<i>I need never be alone</i>

55
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:41,957
<i>I know I say</i>

56
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:44,794
<i>It's the right way</i>

57
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:48,464
<i>But you'll never be the one...</i>

58
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,508
Did you reserve the court?

59
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:54,303
Easy. I can't handle heavy
conversation at this ungodly hour.

60
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,599
Sorry to do this early.
I've got to be done by 10:00.

61
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,435
'You're not going to
make the 8:45, are you?

62
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,103
How did you find me?

63
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,065
'You have to check the
colours for the new issue. '

64
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:10,861
- What are the colours?
- 'Yellow and red, or the traditional white. '

65
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:14,448
- Got to think about it.
- 'David, please. '

66
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:17,159
'Don't be late for the 10
o' clock with the board. '

67
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:21,538
Don't tell anybody where I am. I
don't care if God calls. I'm very busy.

68
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:30,547
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs?

69
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:32,466
They drive you nuts.

70
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,802
That was the desire of
my father who hired them.

71
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,808
You fucked Julie Gianni
again, didn't you?

72
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:46,438
I know someone was there when
I called. You had that tone.

73
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:50,692
"Oh, no, man. I've got a
cold. I'm hanging in today. "

74
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,028
I had a cold.

75
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,072
- I was alone.
- Fine.

76
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,700
You can do what you want with your life,

77
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,328
but one day you'll
know what love truly is.

78
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:03,580
It's the sour and the sweet.

79
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:07,250
I know sour, which allows
me to appreciate the sweet.

80
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,879
Julie Gianni is a friend.

81
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:13,381
Sometimes we sleep together.

82
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:17,677
What? What?

83
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:21,765
My dream girl, Julie Gianni,

84
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:25,477
is your fuck buddy!

85
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:28,980
- What do you want to listen to?
- Slow down.

86
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,775
What have we got here? Barcelona...

87
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:34,194
Radiohead?

88
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,778
Look out!

89
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:38,490
Fuck!

90
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,912
Fuck!

91
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,125
We almost died.

92
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:53,421
I know. My own death was
right there in front of me.

93
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:56,966
You know what happened? Your
life flashed before my eyes.

94
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,761
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.

95
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,098
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.

96
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,476
- Morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

97
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,479
- Eaten anything yet?
- No.

98
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:12,315
David, you were playing racquetball.

99
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:16,944
I've been covering you for an hour
and you're playing racquetball.

100
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,946
We are exiting the elevator.

101
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:20,740
The board is not happy.

102
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,325
Hello, David.

103
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:25,828
You're in "The Post". Courtney Love
called to see if you got her e-mail

104
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:29,582
and Graydon Carter called to see
if you're still on for dinner.

105
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,295
The art department still need the decision
on the colours for the bikini issue.

106
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:37,131
Did I mention the board
is pissed? You're late.

107
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,718
David, hold up! Choose one!

108
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,262
Wait! This one? David!

109
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,765
They're all waiting for you.

110
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:49,101
- You changed your hair.
- Yes, and David...

111
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,354
...opinions are expected.

112
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,862
David.

113
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:04,575
Do you dream about the board,
the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?

114
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:07,870
Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy,

115
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:13,625
Happy, Doc, Dopey
and, of course, Grumpy.

116
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:17,212
- How was Aspen?
- Good.

117
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,841
Now, I want answers and I want them now.

118
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:29,766
How's it going?

119
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,478
'They still look at me as
if I was 11 years old. '

120
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:36,940
He's going to inherit
everything. He gets it all.

121
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,654
- Are you scared of your dreams?
- It's a nightmare either way.

122
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,324
Is that how you explain
what's happened to you?

123
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,617
What happened to your face?

124
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:51,455
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- You don't want to show me your face?

125
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:53,248
No!

126
00:10:56,652 --> 00:11:00,046
- Do you know why you're here?
- The conversation, the coffee...

127
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,966
David, the part where we parry and joust

128
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:07,596
and get to know each other
bit by bit... No can do.

129
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:12,058
We'll have to skip that because
you've been charged with murder.

130
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,688
In four weeks, a judge will determine
your fate based on what I write.

131
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:20,650
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.

132
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,779
There is no murder!

133
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,490
It never happened.

134
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:31,327
I don't have to talk to anybody!

135
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:34,038
- Want me to help?
- Get away from me.

136
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,750
Easy, Face! Your whole
story's full of holes!

137
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:41,754
Stop. Stop! Please leave right
now. I'll take responsibility.

138
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,300
Please leave right
now. He's got control.

139
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,720
I'm going to get you,
daddy's boy, little freak!

140
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:52,056
- My parents are dead, you fuck!
- Enough!

141
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,561
- Is that true?
- Good cop, bad cop.

142
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:59,147
That you're a daddy's boy?

143
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,775
Primer on David Aames, Senior.

144
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:05,778
'My father wasn't built
for the 21st century. '

145
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:09,657
He never went to McDonalds.
He never watched television,

146
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:13,536
yet his biggest magazine
is still the "TV Digest".

147
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:17,165
'He and my mother threw the grandest
parties of the literary world.

148
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:20,668
'Ballooned, jumped out of
aeroplanes. He sought adventure. '

149
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:23,129
His autobiography is the manual

150
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:25,631
for every cut-throat
publisher in New York.

151
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:28,301
It's called "Defending The Kingdom".

Terminar com essa gentileza do Paul
McCartney. I've read it. Page 127:

153
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:35,349
"David Junior was a
delight as a child. "

154
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,061
Did I miss something here? Is
that all he wrote about you?

155
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,481
I don't think he ever got over the fact

156
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:48,571
that I'm absolutely
terrified of heights.

157
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:51,574
The irony continues.

158
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,911
When he and my mother were
run over by a drunken teenager

159
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:59,039
on New Year's Eve, ten years ago,

160
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,668
he left the keys to the kingdom...

161
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,004
...to me.

162
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:13,887
Who all thought they were first in line.

163
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:17,224
And you believe the
board, the Seven Dwarfs,

164
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,686
put you here to take
control of your company?

165
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:26,817
- What do you care?
- We're just talking.

166
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:30,237
Tonight's Wednesday night.

167
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:34,074
I go out for dinner with my
two daughters on Wednesday,

168
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,285
so I'll have to leave soon.

169
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:39,413
You understand that our
time is limited, don't you?

170
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,876
If I talk...

171
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,671
you'll just think I'm crazy.

172
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:02,602
With all the possible
respect I can offer a man

173
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:07,023
wearing a latex mask and spouting
conspiracy theories, David...

174
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:10,360
...believe me. You've
crossed that bridge.

175
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:13,238
Enjoy your dinner.

176
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:19,452
There are five basic
emotions in life, David.

177
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:26,334
Tell me, what emotion gripped
him before he entered that cell?

178
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:30,338
Was it guilt? Hate?

179
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,551
Shame?

180
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:37,804
Revenge?

181
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:46,813
Love?

182
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,441
I'm completely on the
wrong track, aren't I?

183
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:58,199
Who needs ice?

184
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,578
- Hey, Emma!
- David, happy birthday.

185
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,040
You have got the greatest
taste in shoes bar none.

186
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:07,959
Emma, have you met Lynette?

187
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:11,796
No, but I shudder to think
what we might have in common.

188
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:14,382
Did you invite the
entire snowboarding team?

189
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:15,883
It is my birthday.

190
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,636
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.

191
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:23,766
Welcome to Graceland.

192
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,564
Happy birthday, you sonofabitch!

193
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:32,191
Happy birthday!

194
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:35,069
Friends of me!

195
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:37,280
Let the fun ensue.

196
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:44,036
...the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.

197
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,956
It's an amazing, amazing product.

198
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:51,293
No, that's OK. I've got it.

199
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:58,884
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday!

200
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:03,514
- And all the usual shit. How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.

201
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:05,432
David Aames.

202
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,769
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.

203
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,480
We met today at the library.

204
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:15,567
- My coat's too big for your closet.
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.

205
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:19,989
- It's amazing. I love your coat.
- I overdressed. I mean, I underdressed.

206
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:22,491
I'll continue like you're
both listening to me.

207
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:27,162
- Do you have another room to put it in?
- I have ceased to exist.

208
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:30,416
Madison Square Garden is
nearby. It might fit there.

209
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:34,628
- Happy birthday.
- We picked it out together.

210
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,840
- Thank you.
- We picked it out together. We.

211
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,883
You're welcome.

212
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:44,054
Stop flirting and open it.

213
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,475
- Let's get a drink!
- Yes.

214
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,894
I'll leave this upstairs.

215
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:10,622
- Listen...
- Hey, Tommy.

216
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,415
Don't blow me off.

217
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:16,461
I'm all packed, I'm going back
to London and I understand.

218
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:19,965
You put me up for that attorney's
job so you didn't have to fire me.

219
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:23,260
A classy move. Your father
would have done the same.

220
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:27,097
- It's OK, Tommy.
- I became incompetent.

221
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:31,559
Is there anything more
unbecoming than an ageing mascot?

222
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:36,564
I cared for your father. I
lived and breathed for him.

223
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:39,150
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs,

224
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:43,113
they think you're stupid.
A corporate hazard, a rogue.

225
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:45,782
They'll find a way to
catch you out, David.

226
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,662
They're lined up for your
office, your life, your position.

227
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,254
And they're going to sell
this tradition of words

228
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,423
so they can eat in a better cafeteria.

229
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:07,804
What they don't know is
this. People will read again!

230
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,472
Yeah.

231
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:12,183
I got it.

232
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,437
They've even got a nickname
for you behind your back.

233
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:20,650
Citizen... Dildo.

234
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,614
You've got great instincts, but
I say this with complete love.

235
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,577
Claim your life. Learn
to be an asshole...

236
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:35,873
- Two's enough.
- Forgive me.

237
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:42,505
I still believe in this family,
David, even if it's only you.

238
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,633
Drive Tipp home.

239
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:52,765
Give him that big office
across from the Seven Dwarfs.

240
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:57,186
Set up a meeting with the other
attorneys. I'll be in early tomorrow.

241
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,772
Earlier than usual.

242
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:13,077
Hello, handsome.

243
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:17,915
- I've come to wish you happy birthday.
- Oh, man!

244
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:24,046
- I didn't invite you, Julie.
- That was a little weird.

245
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:28,050
That's how it works with
parties. You have to be invited.

246
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:29,718
Oh.

247
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,847
I'm mad at you, you dick.

248
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,892
We made love four times the other night.

249
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:41,313
- Was that good?
- Two's good.

250
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,858
Three... is very good.

251
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,778
- But four...
- Four's pretty good?

252
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:50,072
Four is...

253
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:57,037
Four is what?

254
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:04,002
Hold me, I'll leave and you can go
back and talk to that cute brunette.

255
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,587
Four is what?

256
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:09,716
I don't want to meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.

257
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,011
Four is what?

258
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,680
She looks like a moth, David.

259
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:20,393
- A moth?
- Sometimes I worry about you.

260
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,774
Some clever girl in a silly coat will
come along and play you just the right way.

261
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:31,571
I'll lose my friend and there won't
be chicken soup parties for me and you.

262
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,127
OK.

263
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:57,388
When will you call me? Don't say "soon".

264
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:00,433
I hate it when you say soon.

265
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:07,315
So this is what's
become of rock and roll?

266
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:12,820
A smashed guitar behind a glass case
displayed on some rich guy's wall.

267
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:15,239
It was a gift, actually.

268
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:21,162
- I like it.
- Whoa! Whoa!

269
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:24,957
So how did you get all this
stuff? This apartment, this life?

270
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:31,130
I see.

271
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:40,973
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

272
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,810
- You are, but the food's good.
- I've got a stalker.

273
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:48,522
- It doesn't sound life-threatening.
- I need you to pretend

274
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:53,027
we're having a scintillating conversation
and you are wildly entertained.

275
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,780
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.

276
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:59,075
She's right across the room,
burning a hole in my back.

277
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:02,286
- Red dress, strappy shoes?
- Yes.

278
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:05,206
She's really staring at you.

279
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:09,668
I'm having a drink.

280
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:14,381
- Shit.
- She seems to be crying. Less happy.

281
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:20,221
I think she's the saddest
girl to ever hold a Martini.

282
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:26,310
- Brian Shelby.
- Jennifer Kelly.

283
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:31,523
- You have another apartment?
- Sort of a day office.

284
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,573
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Goodnight.

285
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,451
<i>...get one thing done</i>

286
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:46,497
<i>Don't like the direction
you are going to</i>

287
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,891
<i>Don't like the direction
you have come to...</i>

288
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,143
- I hear her coming!
- Really?

289
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,978
No.

290
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:14,775
<i>Now it has the attention that it used to</i>

291
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:19,654
<i>Stay home all night
with the TV and wife...</i>

292
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:22,365
Brian. How are you?

293
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,953
We're safe, but I've
got nothing to drink.

294
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,664
Who did these paintings?

295
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:33,710
This is Joni Mitchell,
this one is Monet...

296
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:39,341
...and this one was done
by me. It is a snowboard.

297
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:42,802
Well, two of them are geniuses.

298
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:49,726
That is the real thing. His
paintbrush painted the vanilla sky.

299
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:54,481
Canvas. My mother's.

300
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,656
I'm surprised you're surprised.

301
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:06,493
- I can't keep this going.
- Me neither.

302
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,412
- I caught you.
- Brian, come in here.

303
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:12,540
- What's going on?
- I'm drunk.

304
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:16,127
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.

305
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,421
Nobody stalks me so I drink.

306
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:22,216
- We're out of drinks up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.

307
00:24:22,283 --> 00:24:23,968
- Stupid glass.
- I've got it.

308
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:27,472
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry, no big deal.

309
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:31,934
- I'll get us all something.
- I'd better hit it. I drank too much.

310
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,353
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.

311
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,440
- You are my guest of honour.
- Fuck you, David.

312
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:40,443
You're paying me to write
my novel, so you own me.

313
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,571
I don't own you. You are
brilliant, you are handsome.

314
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:47,450
But why do you have to hit on Sofia?

315
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,328
I wasn't hitting on Sofia.

316
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:53,873
Fine, whatever you say.
I'm crazy, I'm blind.

317
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,543
You're drinking Jack Daniels. When
you drink, you start with that...

318
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:02,590
...Frank Sinatra, "she shot me
down, give me a cigarette" thing.

319
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:05,760
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.

320
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:10,222
You're rich and women love you.
I'm from Ohio and I'm drunk.

321
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,683
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.

322
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,188
I dig her. I've never said this
to you before about any girl.

323
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:19,356
But she could be...

324
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:23,819
Could be, could be, could
be the girl of my dreams.

325
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:26,530
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.

326
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:30,159
But if she fucks up our
friendship, she can go to hell.

327
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:32,911
I won't allow it. We are brothers.

328
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:35,205
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.

329
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:36,582
Hey!

330
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:38,876
- How you doing? Gracias.
- De nada.

331
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:41,795
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

332
00:25:41,862 --> 00:25:47,676
- Where are you going?
- I am Frank... and Frank must go.

333
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:52,598
- What?
- I good you bid evening.

334
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,600
Wait, I'll go with you.

335
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,936
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.

336
00:25:58,003 --> 00:26:00,898
No, I have to work tomorrow.

337
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:03,942
You... are in great hands.

338
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,488
I'm just humouring myself
that my opinion matters.

339
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:16,955
You will never know the exquisite pain

340
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:20,584
of the guy who goes home alone.

341
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:25,338
Because without the bitter,
baby, the sweet ain't as sweet.

342
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,383
Have a good time.

343
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,805
Sweet and sour speech again.

344
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,102
<i>Hey, I'm coming down</i>

345
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,313
<i>Like a wrecking ball</i>

346
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,398
<i>Breaking her heart...</i>

347
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,613
A lot of people are scared of heights.

348
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,826
It's not the heights that bother me,
it's the impact that terrifies me.

349
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:04,043
- I won't stay long.
- Hey, Paulo!

350
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:09,966
Hello. I have to take you for a walk.

351
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:14,220
I need protection.
This is a lethal canine.

352
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:17,974
I love living here and
I refuse to clean up.

353
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,143
No problem.

354
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,396
I have to work around the
clock to keep this place.

355
00:27:23,463 --> 00:27:26,649
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.

356
00:27:26,716 --> 00:27:29,736
But I don't dance like you dance.

357
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:34,157
- Do you want something to drink?
- Sure.

358
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:40,872
Hey, Paulo. Beautiful, beautiful boy.

359
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:45,668
What do you want for dinner
tonight? You want fried chicken?

360
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,550
Paulo!

361
00:27:55,453 --> 00:28:00,016
- I like your life.
- It's mine and you can't have it.

362
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:07,648
I don't want to know the story
behind this photo. Who's Sergio?

363
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:11,068
- It's a nickname.
- Your nickname is Sergio?

364
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,904
It's a long story, and
we don't know each other.

365
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,160
- So many secrets.
- I'm really an arms dealer.

366
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:22,746
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.

367
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:25,541
What about you? What's your nickname?

368
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:33,257
Citizen Dildo.

369
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:38,012
You are not staying over.

370
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,894
Never run a company. Stay an
artist. Stay an arms dealer.

371
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:49,565
Please. Somehow I can't
play the violin for you.

372
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:54,528
Although it must be difficult
controlling all those people's lives.

373
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:59,158
Everyone at that party is
connected to you for survival.

374
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:02,369
It seems.

375
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,165
Ever been married?

376
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:13,463
No. Did you ever accept any
of your 12,000 proposals?

377
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,091
12,008. No.

378
00:29:16,158 --> 00:29:19,344
You moved to New York to
dance, paint, act and deal arms?

379
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:25,183
Right. Do you want to hear
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?

380
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,272
Jeff Buckley or Vicki
Carr? Both. Simultaneously.

381
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:37,404
Everyone said: "Don't go to New York.
" But I think good things will happen

382
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:41,741
if you're a good person with a
good attitude. Don't you think?

383
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:50,125
- You think I'm naive.
- No, I really don't.

384
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:53,587
'I dug her completely.

385
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:58,174
'Somehow, I'd found the last
semi-guileless girl in New York City. '

386
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,094
I have to get to sleep.

387
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:05,890
Truthfully, I'm also working
mornings as a dental assistant.

388
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,685
Boy, am I going to the wrong dentist.

389
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:14,816
'You didn't immediately
want to sleep with her? '

390
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:18,069
'Well, you know, I'm
a pleasure delayer. '

391
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:24,158
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delay? You don't know?

392
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:31,457
You keep a relationship casual
until the absolute breaking point.

393
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:36,170
Then one evening, or
afternoon, or morning...

394
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:40,341
It could be months from now.

395
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:45,304
- You know how it works.
- No, actually I don't.

396
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:51,894
- I've been married for 22 years.
- You've got dinner with your daughters.

397
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:55,398
That's right, I do.

398
00:30:55,465 --> 00:31:00,361
Back then I had intricate systems
with women you wouldn't believe.

399
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:05,324
Like... what?

400
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:10,288
Hey, Doc. Don't get all melancholy

401
00:31:10,354 --> 00:31:14,500
over the 30 seconds you
were single a long time ago.

402
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,128
- That's what you think I'm doing?
- Yes.

403
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:20,673
You might be right.

404
00:31:21,157 --> 00:31:24,343
Let's continue. Time is not our friend.

405
00:31:56,942 --> 00:32:01,130
Just our shortcomings. That's
all we're allowed to draw.

406
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:05,843
I've never drawn such
a true likeness before.

407
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,390
- Mine's finished.
- Already?

408
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:19,731
Done.

409
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:25,821
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.

410
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:29,449
It's something you'd see on a
wall in a steak house in hell.

411
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:32,494
It's wonderful. Sign it.

412
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,211
- Let's see yours.
- No.

413
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,381
Give me that.

414
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:47,592
<i>Just had to trust imagination</i>

415
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:51,304
<i>My heart going
boom-boom-boom</i>

416
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:56,059
<i>Son, he said, grab your things
I've come to take you home...</i>

417
00:32:56,668 --> 00:33:01,106
I feel bad. You said
to draw a caricature.

418
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:05,610
I know. I couldn't. I saw you like that.

419
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:11,866
It's very good.

420
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:17,288
- I'll sell it to you.
- You monster.

421
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:20,792
How much for?

422
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:24,629
One kiss.

423
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:33,304
That smile's going to be the end of me.

424
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,143
What happens when your
friend calls you tomorrow?

425
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:45,108
He just met you a few hours
before me. He'd do the same.

426
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:49,404
- I see that friendship is important to you.
- It is.

427
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,865
And as his best friend,

428
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:57,537
I know he's finishing a novel
about inadequacy and rejection,

429
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:01,958
so the longer I stay, the
better it is for his career.

430
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:05,795
Your career is the one I'd worry about.

431
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,096
Sorry.

432
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:17,932
You're more right than you even know.

433
00:34:19,584 --> 00:34:22,478
I used to be one of
those guys that just...

434
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,524
...was snowboarding through his life,

435
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:30,861
with no focus whatsoever.

436
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:35,324
- When did you change?
- About five minutes ago.

437
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:40,287
Every passing minute is another
chance to turn it all around.

438
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:51,006
'And to those who think
that you're a charlatan? '

439
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:57,763
'I understand. A frozen head waiting for
reanimation sounds like science fiction. '

440
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,723
What are you watching?

441
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,811
It's the greatest show.
It's called "Sofia".

442
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:07,689
'Lt's a new science: Life Extension. '

443
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:11,193
'How do you accomplish such a thing? '

444
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,987
I've seen this 30 times.

445
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:17,616
'Life is full of surprises,
but the greatest surprise of all

446
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:20,786
'is that this doesn't
have to end... ever. '

447
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,705
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.

448
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:27,042
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?

449
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:29,044
Good point.

450
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:31,505
'Can you unfreeze a human life? '

451
00:35:31,572 --> 00:35:34,675
'Take the case of Benny the dog.

452
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:38,720
'He was frozen for three months and
thawed out to live a normal life. '

453
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:43,100
That's comforting. It's safe for Benny.

454
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,644
I'm in.

455
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:50,941
'Boy will still meet girl,
they will still fall in love.

457
00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:01,409
We'd better watch out.

00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,254
OK.

461
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,804
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.

462
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:23,890
Come here. I want to tell you a secret.

463
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:48,748
I meant that to be your forehead.

464
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:55,713
Thank you for the inspiration.

465
00:36:57,073 --> 00:37:01,010
I will now attempt to run
my company showing compassion

466
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:06,724
for the seething throng of my partners,
who root quietly for me to fail.

467

And for things you don't
even know. Thank you.

468

have a company to run.

David Aames.

471
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:03,989
- Julie Gianni.
- Hey, handsome.

472
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:08,744
- You're following me.
- Just a little bit.

473
00:38:08,811 --> 00:38:11,246
I wanted to finish what
we were talking about.

474
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:12,956
And?

475
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:18,212
How did it go with our moth girl?
Did she turn into a butterfly for you?

476
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,965
Yes, she did.

477
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,801
She did.

478
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:31,558
I could tell by the way you were
walking you didn't sleep with her.

479
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:35,896
Let me guess. You haven't
slept with her because

480
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:40,025
it's more fun when you draw
it out. Sex just isn't as good

481
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:44,988
if a woman hasn't told her
friends she'd never sleep with you.

482
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:47,866
You're right on the money, Julie.

483
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:52,621
She must be exhausted from trying
to be witty for you all night long.

484
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:57,167
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

485
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:02,047
You're never there for your friends
until they've given up on you.

486
00:39:07,536 --> 00:39:10,305
I'm not blowing you off. I just...

487
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:14,434
I want to be alone for
a little bit. Trust me.

488
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:17,395
I have a lot of things to take care of.

489
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:19,939
If we're friends, which we are,

490
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:23,568
then you'll understand that.

491
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:26,404
I'm sorry. I got weird.

492
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:30,158
I missed an audition

493
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:34,496
and it made me feel bad you
didn't invite me to your party.

494
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:44,464
You want to make it up to
me? I won't tell a soul.

495
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:48,885
<i>You look at me</i>

496
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:53,181
<i>You speak my name</i>

<i>I'm counting down</i>

498
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,440
<i>You are to blame...</i>

499
00:40:04,592 --> 00:40:07,987
Would you do a story
on me if I made a CD?

500
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:19,165
Do you like my music?

501
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:22,251
It's vivid.

502
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:29,967
If I weren't me, I would buy a CD by me.

503
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:33,596
You know, if you can reach one person...

504
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:36,057
Wow.

505
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:45,232
What's happiness to you, David?

506
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:47,818
What's happiness to me?

507
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:52,156
- What is happiness?
- For me...

508
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:56,160
...this is happiness.

509
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:58,454
It's being with you.

510
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:06,629
There's one thing that bothers me.

511
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:10,883
Why did you tell Brian that
I was your... fuck buddy?

512
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:15,304
I didn't tell him
that. I didn't say that.

513
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:20,809
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?

514
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:24,271
About the consequences of
the promises that you've made.

515
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:27,941
- Promises?
- Yes, the promises.

516
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:31,820
I thought...

517
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,573
What are you talking about?

518
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,910
Do you understand how hard it
is to pretend to be your buddy?

519
00:41:38,977 --> 00:41:43,624
David, I love you. I fucking love you.

520
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,794
I fucking love you! Fuck!

521
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,924
Don't do this, don't do this.

522
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:56,178
You fucked me four times
the other night, David.

523
00:41:56,244 --> 00:41:59,514
You've been inside me,
I've swallowed your cum.

524
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:02,058
That means something.

525
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,396
Slow down.

526
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,899
Four times. It means something, David.

527
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,026
- Four times.
- Stop the car.

528
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:14,195
24 hours a day, I live
with this aching possibility

529
00:42:14,262 --> 00:42:16,781
that you might call me to do something.

530
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:19,451
Let's go to your house
and we'll talk this out.

531
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:23,621
Let's just slow down. Will
you stop the car, Julie!

532
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:25,749
When you sleep with someone,

533
00:42:25,815 --> 00:42:29,294
your body makes a promise,
whether you do or not.

534
00:42:31,946 --> 00:42:35,175
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?

535
00:42:39,913 --> 00:42:42,182
What are you doing?

536
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,436
I love you. I love you.

537
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:48,956
Hello.

538
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:54,378
- You're amazing. Hola.
- Hola.

539
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:57,381
Did you get to work all right?

540
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:00,134
Yeah.

541
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,469
No, actually...

542
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:04,680
I had a horrible dream.

543
00:44:04,747 --> 00:44:07,600
You dreamed you'd never see me again.

544
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:10,311
I left your apartment, I
went downstairs to the car

545
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:13,939
and my friend, the stalker,
had followed me there.

546
00:44:14,006 --> 00:44:16,650
- Julie?
- Yes.

547
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:21,905
She wanted to talk to me.
I remember I had this buzz,

548
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:25,617
that buzz from you and me.

549
00:44:25,684 --> 00:44:30,539
I think my mind was still on
that terrible drawing of me.

550
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:35,961
But she was upset.

551
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,549
I don't know. I got in the car...

552
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:44,261
...and she drove off a bridge

553
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:47,764
and committed suicide
with me in the car.

554
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:50,934
I thought you were
going straight to work.

555
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,441
But I survive...

556
00:44:57,507 --> 00:45:00,026
with my arm...

557
00:45:00,093 --> 00:45:04,156
and my face reconstructed.

558
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:07,909
And what's worse...

559
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:11,830
I can't wake up.

560
00:45:36,546 --> 00:45:39,816
How was your house after the party?

561
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:43,695
Party?

562
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:47,782
- What party?
- The party.

563
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:53,121
Remember?

564
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:56,249
Red dress, strappy shoes.

565
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:01,296
I spilled something on your shirt.

566
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:04,090
Sweet and sour,

567
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:08,678
and the saddest girl
to ever hold a Martini.

568
00:46:31,642 --> 00:46:34,203
'My dreams are a cruel joke.

569
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:38,958
'They taunt me.

570
00:46:46,949 --> 00:46:48,634
'Even in my dreams,

571
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:52,805
'I'm an idiot who knows he's
about to wake up to reality.

572
00:46:54,957 --> 00:46:57,601
'Lf I could only avoid sleep...

573
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:01,564
'... but I can't.

574
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:06,652
'I try to tell myself what to dream.
I try to dream that I'm flying.

575
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:09,738
'Something free.

576
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:14,201
'Lt never works. '

577
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,253
Is that the only thing you dream?

578
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:29,007
I don't remember.

579
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:37,975
Do you dream about the car accident?

580
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:42,396
Here's what you remember from a coma
- nothing.

581
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:51,029
- What happened next?
- What really happened?

582
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:57,911
Didn't you read the file? I was
out for three and a half weeks.

583
00:47:57,978 --> 00:48:01,665
My face and arm shattered,
my jaw broken in four places.

584
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:06,461
No surgery could be
performed because of the coma.

585
00:48:07,696 --> 00:48:11,758
You can't feel the darkness or numbness.

586
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,720
You can't even feel.

587
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:19,766
And then, I came back to life.

588
00:48:22,502 --> 00:48:27,023
Just like that dog,
Benny. Benny the dog.

589
00:48:28,049 --> 00:48:30,402
Benny. Benny the dog.

590
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:33,571
Only my life was no longer enjoyable.

591
00:48:34,514 --> 00:48:39,411
There are blinding migraines
now. Nerve damage. Why?

592
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:43,623
This is how big business operates.

593
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,086
Random accidents, a lifestyle mishap.

594
00:48:48,153 --> 00:48:50,421
They are not coincidences.

595
00:48:50,488 --> 00:48:54,759
How do you think airtight
contracts are broken?

596
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:58,304
These are power upheavals.

597
00:48:58,371 --> 00:49:03,101
I'm from Ohio. We don't
have power upheavals.

598
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:07,021
They're in the news every
day, right between the lines.

599
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,441
Someone did this to me.

600
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:14,278
My father wrote about this in his book.

601
00:49:14,345 --> 00:49:17,990
Chapter one, page one, paragraph one.

602
00:49:18,516 --> 00:49:22,245
"What is the answer to
99 out of 100 questions?

603
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,414
"Money. "

604
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:27,834
'David, I don't want to worry you.

605
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,003
'I'm holding them off, but
we've got a situation here. '

606
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:36,926
Only if you're mentally acute.

607
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:39,262
'I'm sorry that poor girl died,

608
00:49:39,328 --> 00:49:42,640
'but you've handed the board
a gift with your mishap.

609
00:49:42,707 --> 00:49:46,310
'They'd like to declare
you incapacitated.

610
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:48,980
'But you're back.

611
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:52,983
'You sound good to me,
so let's fight the fuckers

612
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,363
'and have a full recovery. Maybe
you should let people see you. '

613
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,616
The last time we were
together, you were in a coma

614
00:50:00,683 --> 00:50:05,329
and you were very fucking rude
to me. You didn't say a word.

615
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,626
The rumours of my death
have been mildly exaggerated.

616
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:19,093
'Who could I trust? The ants
were taking over the ant hill.

617
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,347
'Who could I trust? '

618
00:51:24,224 --> 00:51:27,577
'The cranial structure
was based on 30 pins,

619
00:51:27,644 --> 00:51:31,122
'and fastened by micro panels
and bone from the mandible.

620
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:34,167
'The grafts have maintained
your cheek structure.

621
00:51:34,234 --> 00:51:36,753
Unfortunately, as you were in a coma...

622
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,507
'Doctors. Their power is
in jargon, so you study up.

623
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:43,760
Is that the procedure for
all bilateral haematomas

624
00:51:43,827 --> 00:51:46,805
in a LeFort llI fracture
of a comatose patient?

625
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:48,723
'You do your best. '

626
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:52,352
The potential for intra-cranial
brain damage was too great.

627
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:54,187
Beyond the cheek grafts,

628
00:51:54,254 --> 00:51:57,232
are the pins fastened
with any kind of aluminium

629
00:51:57,298 --> 00:52:00,360
which could cause the
pressure in my head?

630
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:02,487
We're working on prostheses,

631
00:52:02,554 --> 00:52:06,407
but you're not at the stage
where we can experiment.

632
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:09,953
Experiment. Use me.

633
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:14,415
- The headaches will go away.
- These are more than headaches.

634
00:52:15,191 --> 00:52:19,253
These are like steel plates
slicing through my every thought.

635
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,631
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.

636
00:52:22,448 --> 00:52:25,009
I can't think straight most of the time.

637
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:29,138
- We can increase your medication.
- Yes. Medication.

638
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:34,685
We'll continue to investigate.
However, there are so many others

639
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:39,273
who have not had the aesthetic
benefit of plastic surgery as you have.

640
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:43,069
This isn't about vanity, Dr Pomerantz.

641
00:52:43,136 --> 00:52:46,948
This isn't about vanity. This is
about functioning in the world.

642
00:52:47,014 --> 00:52:50,117
It's my job to be out there functioning.

643
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:52,828
I've got the money. I'll pay any amount.

644
00:52:54,021 --> 00:52:57,625
Just invent something! Just play jazz.

645
00:52:57,733 --> 00:53:01,837
You say you're the best face
man in New York? Prove it!

646
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:09,011
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!

647
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:16,268
Nobody here takes your
feelings for granted.

648
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:19,813
We prepared something based
on the preliminary examination.

649
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,440
Bring it on!

650
00:53:21,507 --> 00:53:25,194
It's sometimes useful in the
early stages of rejection.

651
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:28,322
It's a facial prosthetic. It
was two weeks in the making.

652
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:30,949
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.

653
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:44,713
- A facial prosthetic?
- The aesthetic replacement does work.

654
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,591
Emotionally and actually.

655
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,719
The plastic in the shield
blocks out abusive rays

656
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:54,181
and assists in the
regeneration of cells.

657
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,144
- It's an aesthetic regenerative shield?
- That's correct.

658
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:02,439
The ergonomics of the plate
barrier allows it to interact

659
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:06,193
- with the movements of your face.
- I see.

660
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,030
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.

661
00:54:10,097 --> 00:54:12,991
For a minute there, I
thought we were talking about

662
00:54:13,058 --> 00:54:15,285
a fucking mask!

663
00:54:17,062 --> 00:54:20,749
It's only a mask if
you treat it that way.

664
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:25,003
No, it's great. This completely
takes care of Halloween.

665
00:54:27,322 --> 00:54:32,052
But what about the other
364 days of the year?

666
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:49,235
'A new form of me began to take shape.

667
00:54:49,302 --> 00:54:54,824
'I planned my re-emergence
like the Normandy invasion. '

668
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,620
Sofia. Sofia.

669
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:01,456
So-fi-a...
Serrano.

670
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,459
'I'll just say it.

671
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:08,421
'I did my homework. I read every memo.

672
00:55:09,531 --> 00:55:13,968
'Thomas Tipp was right
- people will read again.

673
00:55:15,328 --> 00:55:18,931
'I attended the monthly meeting
of the Seven Dwarfs by video. '

674
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:22,602
People aren't buying
books! Let's invest.

675
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:25,355
'Oh, baby. This was war.

676
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:28,816
'I grew stronger in ways I'd never known

677
00:55:28,883 --> 00:55:33,488
'and on December 5th,
my planes filled the sky.

678
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:38,284
'The return of David
Aames, Jr. Citizen Dildo. '

679
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,174
Did you see his face?

680
00:56:17,348 --> 00:56:20,659
You won't believe this...

681
00:56:23,062 --> 00:56:26,373
...but this is me smiling.

682
00:56:32,404 --> 00:56:34,256
It's been a long time.

683
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:37,968
I tried to see you, but
your people wouldn't let me.

684
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:40,763
I didn't want to see me, OK?

685
00:56:41,413 --> 00:56:45,768
But then I woke up today, and finally...

686
00:56:46,877 --> 00:56:48,687
...a good hair day.

687
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:54,318
You want to get together?

688
00:56:57,054 --> 00:56:58,155
Sure.

689
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:02,868
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.

690
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:07,080
This weekend. I'll cancel
an operation or two.

691
00:57:07,564 --> 00:57:09,583
We'll have fun.

692
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:13,587
Because I am all about fun.

693
00:57:16,531 --> 00:57:20,135
'Our first guest tonight is
an amazing survival story.

694
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:22,429
'Please welcome Benny the dog!

695
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:30,896
'Welcome to the show, Gary.

696
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:33,023
'I have so many questions.

697
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:37,777
'Tell us what has happened to
Benny? What's Benny been through? '

698
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:41,573
'Benny fell into the water near our home

699
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,036
- 'and was frozen in the Skykomish river. '
- 'Ln Washington. '

700
00:57:46,102 --> 00:57:49,914
'I went fishing, thinking he'd
been gone for three months,

701
00:57:49,981 --> 00:57:53,293
'and I see him in a block of ice. '

702
00:57:53,985 --> 00:57:56,379
'He is thawed out now, is that correct?

703
00:57:56,446 --> 00:57:59,924
'He's not moving a lot. I'm worried.

704
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:02,677
'I'm worried about the dog. '

705
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:06,347
'He's fine. He's just lost
a little of his friskiness. '

706
00:58:06,873 --> 00:58:09,017
Sofia? It's David.

707
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:13,897
I'm back in your life.
I saw you earlier today.

708
00:58:13,963 --> 00:58:19,819
I was just watching our old
friend Benny the dog on "Conan"

709
00:58:21,262 --> 00:58:24,073
and I thought of you.

710
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:26,701
Whatever. I...

711
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:30,413
...I loved seeing you today.

712
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:33,916
So I will see you soon.

713
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:37,462
You're a great dancer.

714
00:59:30,414 --> 00:59:33,225
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.

715
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:36,520
I'm in the mood for a cheap,
overpriced rum and Coke.

716
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:38,689
- Do you want one?
- Is there any other kind?

717
00:59:38,756 --> 00:59:42,443
- I'll get us some.
- Where is the bathroom?

718
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:44,903
It's behind...

719
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:49,158
Over there, by the girl
who looks like Björk.

720
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:52,035
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should...

721
00:59:53,687 --> 00:59:56,248
You look good. How's your book?

722
00:59:56,732 --> 00:59:59,710
- Take it off.
- This is a facial shield.

723
00:59:59,777 --> 01:00:03,172
It's kind of like a prosthesis.

724
01:00:03,238 --> 01:00:05,674
Take off the mask. It's freaking me out.

725
01:00:05,741 --> 01:00:07,759
I can't.

726
01:00:08,243 --> 01:00:11,138
It's my face. This is my face.

727
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:13,682
Trust me, it's a little different.

728
01:00:13,749 --> 01:00:18,020
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.

729
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:19,980
Sofia asked me.

730
01:00:20,047 --> 01:00:22,899
She didn't want to be alone
with me? That's bullshit!

731
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:25,902
I'm being pretty cool
about this whole thing.

732
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:29,656
Talk to a shrink. Or are
you going to call me sometime

733
01:00:29,723 --> 01:00:31,908
instead of hiding in your apartment?

734
01:00:31,975 --> 01:00:35,454
Don't take it out on a
girl you only met once.

735
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,707
Did she say that? Once?

736
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:40,792
She said I met her once?

737
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:44,337
Just cut it out. I miss the old you.

738
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:47,340
We all miss the old you.

739
01:00:47,407 --> 01:00:50,135
Because the new guy is shit.

740
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,974
That came out wrong. I love you. Period.

741
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:59,894
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.

742
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:05,859
How about no sympathy? How
about that's the deal we make?

743
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:20,123
Give me a Budweiser
and a shot of tequila.

744
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,083
What kind of tequila?

745
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:27,505
- What did you say to me?
- I said, "What kind of tequila?"

746
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,176
Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch?

747
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:37,807
Patron, if you have it.

748
01:01:37,874 --> 01:01:40,101

749
01:01:40,168 --> 01:01:42,645

757
01:02:06,694 --> 01:02:09,880

- This is on the house.

758
01:02:09,947 --> 01:02:14,176
- Why?
- It just is... bitch.

759

767
01:03:05,169 --> 01:03:07,271
Patron!

768
01:03:16,054 --> 01:03:18,740
Fix your fucking face!

769
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:12,877
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

770
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:16,047
Idea
- let's start over.

771
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:21,010
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

772
01:04:21,077 --> 01:04:23,429
"You are, but the food is good. "

773
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:27,141
I've got this little
problem. I've got a stalker.

774
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:31,271
"It doesn't sound life-threatening. "

775
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:35,066
I need you to pretend we're
having a scintillating conversation

776
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:39,320
and you are wildly
entertained. I know it's tough.

777
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:43,157
- "I'll improvise. "
- I don't talk like that.

778
01:04:44,225 --> 01:04:47,954
She's right across the room,
burning a hole in my back.

779
01:04:51,733 --> 01:04:54,418
Red dress, strappy shoes.

780
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:59,632
That's right.

781
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:05,513
I think she is the saddest
girl to ever hold a Martini.

782
01:05:19,093 --> 01:05:21,362
- Are you OK?
- No.

783
01:05:22,013 --> 01:05:24,115
What's wrong? Is it me?

784
01:05:25,433 --> 01:05:27,368
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.

785
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:30,663
Tell me now. If something's
wrong, please tell me now.

786
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:34,708
- Just talk about everything.
- I'll tell you later!

787
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:37,461
Let's get it all out.
Say everything now.

788
01:05:37,528 --> 01:05:41,173
Just say everything. Say
everything now, now, now.

789
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,177
I'll tell you in another
life when we are both cats.

790
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:53,936
I can't believe you just said that.

791
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:58,774
That's the greatest
thing I've ever heard.

792
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:01,819
That's hilarious. That you said that.

793
01:06:02,428 --> 01:06:05,322
That's... You said that. You said that.

794
01:06:05,389 --> 01:06:08,909
That is what I love about you.

795
01:06:09,852 --> 01:06:12,371
That's hilarious.

796
01:06:12,438 --> 01:06:15,916
I'll tell you in another
life when we are both cats.

797
01:06:17,234 --> 01:06:19,461
Cats! Cats!

798
01:06:25,409 --> 01:06:29,179
- This is where I leave you.
- I'll walk you to your door.

799
01:06:29,246 --> 01:06:32,224
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike.

800
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,393
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.

801
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:37,187
Can't you see she
wants to go on her own?

802
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:39,773
Shut up, you're drunk.

803
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,110
I may be an idiot, but I'm not drunk.

804
01:06:43,176 --> 01:06:47,614
Seriously, I don't need you
to walk me home. Thank you.

805
01:06:48,557 --> 01:06:50,575
OK, then, so...

806
01:06:50,976 --> 01:06:53,119
...we'll call you.

807
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:56,289
We'll go catch a movie or something.

808
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,334
So we'll meet up soon.

809
01:07:02,779 --> 01:07:04,506
We'll meet up soon.

810
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:17,727
We'll call you again to go out with me.

811
01:07:18,545 --> 01:07:20,897
We'll call you.

812
01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:24,734
It's been a real blast,
David. I bid you good evening.

813
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:26,903
Wait, where are you going?

814
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:29,989
My bike is back over
there. We'll hang soon.

815
01:07:30,056 --> 01:07:33,201
Bring your mask if you
want. I'm getting used to it.

816
01:07:35,311 --> 01:07:37,956
- Wait a minute.
- What?

817
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:42,335
I don't know.

818
01:07:42,402 --> 01:07:45,505
You drank too much. Call me tomorrow.

819
01:07:45,572 --> 01:07:48,383
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

820
01:07:50,743 --> 01:07:53,638
No, you won't. You just need to sleep.

821
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:59,393
- Hey. Hey!
- What?

822
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:08,986
What did you say to Julie
Gianni the night of the accident?

823
01:08:09,053 --> 01:08:15,868
- What?
- You told her she was a fuck buddy.

824
01:08:16,686 --> 01:08:18,621
Never.

825
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:22,041
She was a little more
than pissed about it.

826
01:08:22,692 --> 01:08:25,795
Have you been harbouring
this shit all along?

827
01:08:25,861 --> 01:08:28,547
I never talked to her.

828
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:34,303
Whatever.

829
01:08:35,955 --> 01:08:40,976
Anyway, who am I if I can't be the
one to tell you you're not ugly?

830
01:08:42,336 --> 01:08:46,148
Come on! Give me a courtesy laugh!

831
01:08:47,133 --> 01:08:52,154
Brian, I'm so fucked
up. I'm just so fucked up

832
01:08:59,395 --> 01:09:03,665
We're best friends! We're bro's!

833
01:09:03,732 --> 01:09:06,877
Come on, man. We're bro's.

834
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:18,680
<i>Readying to bury your
father and your mother</i>

835
01:09:19,373 --> 01:09:24,978
<i>What did you think when you lost another</i>

836
01:09:25,546 --> 01:09:31,109

01:09:50,195 --> 01:09:55,675

<i>Oh... but sweetness follows...</i>

844

Boo!

846
01:10:56,302 --> 01:11:01,824
- This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
- I'm OK. I'm OK.

847
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:04,744
And it worked. Get up.

848
01:11:05,436 --> 01:11:06,996
I agree.

849
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,084
This is a joke.

850
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:15,046
David, I'm not going to lie to you.

851
01:11:15,113 --> 01:11:18,382
I liked the way you looked. But...

852
01:11:19,242 --> 01:11:22,595
...you have to pull
it the fuck together.

853
01:11:22,662 --> 01:11:25,514
If not, I'll forget the other guy.

854
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:29,185
You know that other guy? You?

855
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:32,980
I'm still that guy.

856
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:38,277
I don't have a mother saviour bone
in my body. It's not about that.

857
01:11:38,344 --> 01:11:42,782
You are coming inside, but if this
turns out to be a big mistake...

858
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:48,579
...I do have the ability to fall
out of love with you like that.

859
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:02,217
'We created our own world together.

860
01:12:02,326 --> 01:12:04,845
'Us versus them. '

861
01:12:04,912 --> 01:12:09,516
- Where's Brian?
- Brian? He went with you, didn't he?

862
01:12:10,084 --> 01:12:12,728
I thought you guys hooked up.

863
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:17,608
I wish you hadn't got in
the car with that girl.

864
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,904
Sofia, I...

865
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:27,659
Your eyes apologise better.

866
01:12:29,269 --> 01:12:31,455
Come on.

867
01:12:31,855 --> 01:12:37,461
Holy God! This is going to change
my life in a zillion different ways.

868
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,921
I must be nuts!

869
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,132
'We were quite a pair.

870
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:47,971
'Her believing in me, me believing
that I actually deserved it. '

871
01:13:03,095 --> 01:13:05,030
Ah, Sofia.

872
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:09,618
I see you haven't
been wasting your time.

873
01:13:09,976 --> 01:13:14,205
- Do you ever draw anything else?
- No.

874
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,292
Did you sleep last night?

875
01:13:17,776 --> 01:13:19,502
I love you.

876
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:21,796
No, I did not sleep.

877
01:13:21,863 --> 01:13:25,842
Got to leave early today, David,
so you'll have to be brief.

878
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:30,388
What can you tell me
about the name Ellie?

879
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,642
Ellie.

880
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:37,520
Was that a girl you were in love with?

881
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:39,814
I've only been in love once.

882
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:43,276
Apparently you kept
repeating it last night.

883
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:47,363
You did sleep, David. Your
advisor said you cried out.

884
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,325
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.

885
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:54,203
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?

886
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,709
I... I don't...

887
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:04,547
Dig deep, David. Dig deep.

888
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:09,051
You cried out for Ellie. What
do you remember about Ellie?

889
01:14:10,495 --> 01:14:12,972
Show me your face, David.

890
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,393
Help me open the door.

891
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:31,157
It's true you had an accident,
it's true you were disfigured.

892
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:33,451
But not any more.

893
01:14:33,809 --> 01:14:36,078
Do you remember?

894
01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:40,583
They did fix your face.

895
01:14:41,984 --> 01:14:47,298
Take off that mask, David. You'll
see your face is perfect under there.

896
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:51,594
I never trusted the doctors.

897
01:14:52,953 --> 01:14:56,182
What happened next was surreal.

898
01:14:57,166 --> 01:15:00,686
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr Pomerantz, called me

899
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:03,314
and suddenly he was my new best friend.

900
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:08,068
David! My brother! I felt really
bad about our last conversation.

901
01:15:08,135 --> 01:15:11,530
'He'd discovered a new form
of reconstructive surgery

902
01:15:11,597 --> 01:15:14,033
'with the help of a
doctor from Berlin. '

903
01:15:14,099 --> 01:15:15,367
Hello.

904
01:15:15,434 --> 01:15:19,496
'Next thing I knew, they shot me
full of drugs I'd never heard of

905
01:15:19,563 --> 01:15:21,707
'and away we went. '

906
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:25,919
<i>What if God was one of us?</i>

907
01:15:27,488 --> 01:15:31,383
<i>Just a slob like one of us?</i>

908
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:34,636
<i>Trying to make his way home...</i>

909
01:15:34,703 --> 01:15:36,513
He's got a good voice.

910
01:15:43,462 --> 01:15:46,898
And facial tissue could be regenerated.

911
01:15:46,965 --> 01:15:50,569
...the concept of endoscopic,
periorbital fibre optics.

912
01:15:50,636 --> 01:15:54,406
- Where are we eating later?
- I can't even tell you what they did.

913
01:15:54,473 --> 01:15:56,742
It seemed like science fiction.

914
01:15:56,808 --> 01:16:00,954
Madonna had that song "Borderline".
That was a hell of a song.

915
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:04,374
This is going to be one
good-looking guy when I'm done.

916
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:07,043
'Obviously I was suspicious. '

917
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:12,757
- Wouldn't you be?
- Suspicious of whom? Of what?

918
01:16:13,325 --> 01:16:17,971
Doc, once you've been driven
off a bridge at 80 miles an hour,

919
01:16:18,413 --> 01:16:23,310
somehow you don't invite happiness
in without a full body search.

920
01:16:26,546 --> 01:16:31,234
At the risk of boring you, I can
present the alternate argument.

921
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:36,656
I once knew a guy who was a real loner.

922
01:16:37,974 --> 01:16:40,118
One day he woke up at 40

923
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:43,538
with two daughters that lit
up his life with purpose.

924
01:16:43,605 --> 01:16:46,332
He suddenly goes to
endless school plays,

925
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,627
he gets home at 9:20 for
the evening discussion

926
01:16:49,694 --> 01:16:52,672
and he has the time of his life.

927
01:16:53,448 --> 01:16:57,677
His favourite Beatle was
once John and now it's Paul.

928
01:17:00,038 --> 01:17:02,890
I always liked George.

929
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:07,186
It all depends on the
individual, doesn't it?

930
01:17:07,253 --> 01:17:11,441
- Tell me, what's happiness for you?
- What's happiness to you, David?

931
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:17,613
- How about another question?
- You won't show me your face, will you?

932
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:23,119
So, back to the timeline.
Hurry, let's move through this.

933
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:25,204
David!

934
01:17:26,731 --> 01:17:29,625
- David?
- What?

935
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:36,215
- You've got to take the plates off.
- I don't want to know what's under here.

936
01:17:36,282 --> 01:17:38,551
It'll be fine, you'll see.

937
01:17:38,618 --> 01:17:42,054
I called Pomerantz and
switched it to Wednesday.

938
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:49,520
What?

939
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:54,859
I hope that women at the front
desk gave you shit about it.

940
01:17:56,135 --> 01:17:59,530
Another day won't matter,
and the Mustang will be fixed.

941
01:17:59,597 --> 01:18:02,867
The plan was going in the
Mustang. It's not ready.

942
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:07,162
So we'll go tomorrow in the
Mustang, when it's fixed.

943
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:09,373
I know that the problem

944
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,502
wouldn't be you delaying
something you were dreading.

945
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:19,174
- Couldn't be that.
- No, couldn't be that.

946
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:24,012
I mean...

947
01:18:32,796 --> 01:18:35,607
I mean... I agree.

948
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:41,238
I think it's very important to have...

949
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:46,702
...the right car...

950
01:18:53,525 --> 01:18:55,335
...to take you...

951
01:18:57,446 --> 01:19:00,298
...where you want to go...

952
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,888
...24 hours a day.

953
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,582
How bad is it?

954
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:41,172
Well, your ears are in the right place.

955
01:19:43,742 --> 01:19:46,386
And the rest of it...

956
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:51,266
...is not too bad at all.

957
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,648
It's perfect.

958
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:18,960
<i>When she said, "Don't waste
your words, they're just lies,"</i>

959
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:22,004
<i>I cried she was deaf</i>

960
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:30,137
<i>And she worked on my face
until breaking my eyes</i>

961
01:20:30,204 --> 01:20:33,474
<i>Then said, "What else
have you got left?"</i>

962
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:38,437
<i>It was then that I got up to leave</i>

963
01:20:38,504 --> 01:20:41,190
<i>But she said, "Don't forget,</i>

964
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:47,113
<i>Everybody must give something back</i>

965
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:49,031
<i>For something they get...</i>

966
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:53,077
Do you love me? I mean really love me?

967
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:58,332
Because if you don't,
I'll just have to kill you.

968
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,713
In my next life...

969
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:09,260
In my next life, I'm going to
come back as this mole right here.

970
01:21:10,327 --> 01:21:13,097
Seriously, this mole.

971
01:21:13,164 --> 01:21:19,061
You'll have to wear bikini tops
to work so that I can breathe.

972
01:21:19,795 --> 01:21:22,815
I love you. Love you.

973
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:27,653
I love you.

974
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,989
I can live right there.

975
01:21:36,103 --> 01:21:38,372
Is this a dream?

976
01:21:39,106 --> 01:21:40,958
Absolutely.

977
01:21:51,618 --> 01:21:54,972
'We talked about the big
things, the little things...

978
01:21:55,038 --> 01:21:57,349
'... and the big things.

979
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:02,020
'But, in truth, with Sofia
it was the in-between times. '

980
01:22:04,464 --> 01:22:08,276
<i>In the days When we were
swinging from the trees</i>

981
01:22:08,343 --> 01:22:11,279
<i>I was a monkey...</i>

982
01:22:11,346 --> 01:22:12,823
Je t'aime.

983
01:22:12,889 --> 01:22:16,910
<i>Stealing honey from a swarm of bees</i>

984
01:22:16,977 --> 01:22:20,789
<i>I could taste</i>

985
01:22:20,856 --> 01:22:24,084
<i>I could taste you even then</i>

986
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:26,628
<i>And I would chase you...</i>

987
01:22:26,695 --> 01:22:29,923
- What did she say?
- I have no idea.

988
01:22:33,493 --> 01:22:35,553
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.

989
01:22:36,288 --> 01:22:38,598
Brian, how's things?

990
01:22:38,665 --> 01:22:41,601
Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.

991
01:22:41,668 --> 01:22:45,355
Besides, Sofia is great, but
by no means one of a kind.

992
01:22:45,422 --> 01:22:48,483
She was a proximity infatuation.

993
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:52,278
Don't use that, it's mine.

994
01:22:53,722 --> 01:22:55,782
Where did you get this camera?

995
01:22:55,849 --> 01:22:59,327
I'm into things you
have no idea, my friend.

996
01:23:00,728 --> 01:23:04,999
- Just so long as you're OK.
- Anyway, we're friends, aren't we?

997
01:23:05,191 --> 01:23:07,210
- Always.
- That's right.

998
01:23:19,956 --> 01:23:22,266
What's up with your face?

999
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:24,268
Fuck!

1000
01:23:24,335 --> 01:23:27,396
There's a seam opening or something!

1001
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,238
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.

1002
01:23:36,055 --> 01:23:38,115
I know.

1003
01:24:58,554 --> 01:25:00,864
Was I snoring?

1004
01:25:02,224 --> 01:25:07,537
No. I think it was me. I
was thirsty, that's all.

1005
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,753
I'm dreaming about you. Mmm.

1006
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:33,873
I could listen to you say
"mmm" for the rest of my life.

1007
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:48,638
Baby, what's wrong?

1008
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:57,480
- Where is she?
- Who?

1009
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:03,611
Who?

1010
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:32,598
I'm Sofia.

1011
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:41,231
I'm going to make sure that I tie
it four times. You know why, Julie?

1012
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:44,443
Because four times
really means something.

1013
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:46,904
Please don't hurt me.

1014
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,656
I'm freaked out, it worked.

1015
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:54,703
You won't get away with this,
so just tell me where Sofia is.

1016
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:58,123
- I am Sofia.
- Where's Sofia?

1017
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,460
- I am Sofia!
- Where is she?

1018
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,087
I'm calling the police. Tell it to them.

1019
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:07,716
You survived the accident.
Whose body was it?

1020
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,969
It was the board, the
Seven Dwarfs, wasn't it?

1021
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:15,057
You're trying to steal my life!
You weren't in an accident.

1022
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,684
Now it's attempted murder!

1023
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:20,145
I am Sofia, please!

1024
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,607
Tell it to them.

1025
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,444
This is David Aames. I need help.

1026
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:31,823
I've captured an intruder
who's entered my home.

1027
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,158
Oh, God!

1028
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:37,913
Wake up man. Are you for real?

1029
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,884
They've kept me here for three hours.

1030
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:54,304
They think that I had
something to do with this.

1031
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,432
Can you give us a minute here?

1032
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,809
Thanks very much.

1033
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,856
They think I had
something to do with this.

1034
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,443
We're going to handle this
the way your father would.

1035
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,322
- I've got it solved.
- You've got it solved?

1036
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,657
Where is she?

1037
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,537
She's going to be fine. This
whole file is going to...

1038
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:25,251
Thank God you're here.

1039
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:26,919
It's OK.

1040
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,881
I love her.

1041
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:34,469
Look at these photos, then
I'm going to destroy them.

1042
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:38,931
Sofia's testimony is also
in here. It won't exist.

1043
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,393
She's not going to press charges.

1044
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:49,901
- Press charges against me?
- David, wake up.

1045
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,239
As a friend...

1046
01:29:55,806 --> 01:30:00,077
...I think you should
see what you did to Sofia.

1047
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:05,249
The press won't get hold of
this if you get away quickly.

1048
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:10,421
This is Julie Gianni, this is not Sofia.

1049
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,716
This is Julie Gianni.

1050
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,887
I didn't do this to her.
Someone's setting me up.

1051
01:30:17,953 --> 01:30:21,849
David, the board and I have
taken care of everything.

1052
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:25,811
They've been really great, actually.

1053
01:30:25,961 --> 01:30:32,818
All this is going to disappear.
We're all behind you, even the board.

1054
01:30:44,813 --> 01:30:46,707
Get out of here.

1055
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,755
This is a revolution of the mind.

1056
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:04,057
You're insane!

1057
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,935
Don't ever hit a girl!

1058
01:31:07,002 --> 01:31:09,980
Hit me, but don't ever hit a girl!

1059
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,983
It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.

1060
01:31:14,009 --> 01:31:17,654
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.

1061
01:31:19,598 --> 01:31:22,617
So Sofia was abducted by Julie

1062
01:31:23,101 --> 01:31:25,996
and now Julie is posing as Sofia.

1063
01:31:28,815 --> 01:31:31,710
You're in OJ land, man.

1064
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:34,212
Julie Gianni is dead!

1065
01:31:34,279 --> 01:31:40,010
I don't care what they told you. I
can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.

1066
01:31:40,076 --> 01:31:45,599
- I didn't talk to them, I talked to Sofia.
- Where is she?

1067
01:31:45,665 --> 01:31:49,019
I just dropped Sofia off. I
saw everything you did to her.

1068
01:31:49,085 --> 01:31:51,563
I did not do that to her.

1069
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:58,778
Look me in the eye and tell me that's
the girl you brought to the party.

1070
01:31:58,845 --> 01:32:03,867
Tell me that's your dream girl,
your proximity infatuation.

1071
01:32:03,933 --> 01:32:07,704
Yes! And you stole her from me.

1072
01:32:07,771 --> 01:32:11,875
The one girl I really wanted
and you took her from me.

1073
01:32:11,941 --> 01:32:14,961
You're insane. You're losing it, man!

1074
01:32:15,111 --> 01:32:18,548
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

1075
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:21,801
I'm with them.

1076
01:32:26,372 --> 01:32:31,311
Where did you get the coat, Brian?
Where did you get the camera?

1077
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,063
How much did they pay you?

1078
01:32:35,048 --> 01:32:39,527
Listen to me, because this is the
last time we're ever going to speak.

1079
01:32:39,594 --> 01:32:44,031
- I was your only friend.
- You have revealed yourself to me.

1080
01:33:07,496 --> 01:33:09,181
Problems?

1081
01:33:10,207 --> 01:33:13,144
I'm in no mood to be fucked with, so...

1082
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:16,397
There's an explanation
for all this, David.

1083
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:21,694
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.

1084
01:33:23,304 --> 01:33:26,115
I'm here to help you, David.

1085
01:33:27,975 --> 01:33:31,871
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?

1086
01:33:31,937 --> 01:33:35,499
First of all, it's very
important that you calm down.

1087
01:33:37,026 --> 01:33:40,754
Calm down? Calm down!

1088
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:44,174
You must overcome your
fears and regain control.

1089
01:33:44,241 --> 01:33:48,429
Take hold of your life again, David.
It's as easy as holding that glass.

1090
01:33:49,622 --> 01:33:54,476
What if I were to tell you that
you can take control of all of this?

1091
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,104
Even me.

1092
01:33:57,921 --> 01:34:00,023
I'm straight, OK?

1093
01:34:04,344 --> 01:34:07,406
David, look at all these people.

1094
01:34:07,473 --> 01:34:10,951
Seems as though they're all
just chatting away, doesn't it?

1095
01:34:11,018 --> 01:34:13,370
- Nothing to do with you?
- No.

1096
01:34:13,437 --> 01:34:18,500
And yet maybe they're only here
because you wanted them to be here.

1097
01:34:19,818 --> 01:34:21,962
You are their god.

1098
01:34:22,029 --> 01:34:26,508
You can make them obey
you or even destroy you.

1099
01:34:26,575 --> 01:34:30,887
What I'd love for them
to do is shut the fuck up,

1100
01:34:30,954 --> 01:34:32,472
especially you.

1101
01:34:44,843 --> 01:34:46,486
You see?

1102
01:34:58,607 --> 01:35:01,167
You and I signed a contract, David.

1103
01:35:01,234 --> 01:35:04,254
'Who is the man in the
restaurant? ' Who is it?

1104
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:10,051
Can you tell the difference
between dreams and reality?

1105
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:12,762
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.

1106
01:35:13,913 --> 01:35:19,310
Think with your head. You
signed a contract, did you not?

1107
01:35:21,212 --> 01:35:24,732
- I signed something.
- Was the man in the restaurant there?

1108
01:35:26,676 --> 01:35:30,113
- Fuck!
- Accept your body's resistance.

1109
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:32,490
Let your head answer.

1110
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:38,454
- Yes.
- That's right. Who is Ellie?

1111
01:35:40,982 --> 01:35:44,419
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?

1112
01:35:44,485 --> 01:35:48,005
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.

1113
01:35:48,072 --> 01:35:51,259
You understand you hold
the keys to this prison?

1114
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:53,678
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?

1115
01:35:53,745 --> 01:35:55,972
- No.
- Who was it?

1116
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,773
You want to let it
out, don't you, David?

1117
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,987
You're about to tell me.

1118
01:36:11,345 --> 01:36:16,951
Tell me what your heart and soul
will not allow you to forget.

1119
01:36:19,854 --> 01:36:22,248
Did you kill Sofia?

1120
01:37:13,407 --> 01:37:15,551
I thought you were a vandal.

1121
01:37:17,619 --> 01:37:20,097
Who are you?

1122
01:37:24,126 --> 01:37:26,186
I'm Sofia.

1123
01:37:27,963 --> 01:37:31,024
You are not Sofia!

1124
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:36,696
You are not Sofia.

1125
01:37:38,056 --> 01:37:42,244
I'm Sofia. We're going
to be together again.

1126
01:37:43,353 --> 01:37:47,499
You're going to forget about Juliana
and we're going to be together.

1127
01:37:47,566 --> 01:37:50,502
I'm not going to be
afraid of you any more.

1128
01:37:50,569 --> 01:37:53,630
I'll get you a cold
towel. I'll be right back.

1129
01:37:54,656 --> 01:37:56,716
I love you.

1130
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:17,987
'Pleasure delayer. '

1131
01:38:26,438 --> 01:38:28,540
Sofia?

1132
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:49,018
I am Sofia.

1133
01:38:55,091 --> 01:38:59,695
I love you. I missed you so much.

1134
01:39:09,021 --> 01:39:11,165
Where were you?

1135
01:39:16,696 --> 01:39:22,510
Forget it. I don't need
to know. It doesn't matter.

1136
01:39:25,413 --> 01:39:27,723
Just tell me that you love me.

1137
01:39:33,087 --> 01:39:35,022
I love you.

1138
01:39:37,466 --> 01:39:40,486
What is happiness to you, David?

1139
01:39:40,594 --> 01:39:43,948
For me, it's being here with you.

1140
01:39:51,021 --> 01:39:54,166
What the fuck is happening?

1141
01:39:57,319 --> 01:39:59,755
What the fuck is happening?

1142
01:39:59,822 --> 01:40:03,425
David was a real delight as a child.

1143
01:40:07,246 --> 01:40:10,599
I'm so afraid of how powerful this is.

1144
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:14,144
Oh, David.

1145
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:34,790
Red dress, strappy shoes...

1146
01:40:44,741 --> 01:40:48,178
That is the greatest
thing I have ever heard.

1147
01:40:48,995 --> 01:40:52,224
I'll tell you in another
life when we are both cats.

1148
01:40:58,672 --> 01:41:00,982
What's happening?

1149
01:42:23,965 --> 01:42:26,400
I did it, didn't I?

1150
01:42:28,511 --> 01:42:32,156
But I don't feel like I killed someone.

1151
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:40,581
- I feel like I'm in a dream.
- Who was the man at the restaurant?

1152
01:42:59,375 --> 01:43:03,771
Sometimes the mind behaves
as if it were a dream.

1153
01:43:03,837 --> 01:43:07,816
Faces change, people
become other people.

1154
01:43:08,759 --> 01:43:12,446
The subconscious is a powerful thing.

1155
01:43:13,555 --> 01:43:17,409
You treated Julie
carelessly, didn't you?

1156
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:29,838
Your feelings of responsibility
or guilt over Julie

1157
01:43:29,905 --> 01:43:33,634
might have turned Sofia into Julie.

1158
01:43:36,078 --> 01:43:40,098
- Do you know what derangement is?
- I need your help.

1159
01:43:42,251 --> 01:43:47,230
All I know is you killed your girlfriend
and I don't know what's in your mind.

1160
01:43:47,297 --> 01:43:49,566
I need your help.

1161
01:43:49,633 --> 01:43:54,571
I would work on this case forever if
I could, but we've run out of time.

1162
01:43:59,101 --> 01:44:01,578
What will you plead?

1163
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:09,669
Temporary derangement.
That's your best chance.

1164
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:14,007
I don't think they'll believe me.

1165
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:17,844
Who do you believe?

1166
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:22,140
Believe it or not, I care about you.

1167
01:44:23,249 --> 01:44:27,979
You've become like family to me.

1168
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,861
I don't want to give up on you, David.

1169
01:44:34,928 --> 01:44:39,657
But I needed more. I needed an answer.

1170
01:44:40,517 --> 01:44:43,453
I even thought there was a chance

1171
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,997
somebody was playing a trick on you.

1172
01:44:46,064 --> 01:44:51,169
Maybe it was the board. But
I can't exceed my duties.

1173
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:59,135
I'm just a psychologist...

1174
01:45:00,244 --> 01:45:02,638
...and I have to go now.

1175
01:45:06,376 --> 01:45:09,270
Will I see you at the trial?

1176
01:45:10,171 --> 01:45:14,567
No, I'm just the opening act.

1177
01:45:34,487 --> 01:45:38,883
'Reassurance is our speciality.
That's the Life Extension creed.

1178
01:45:46,749 --> 01:45:49,602
'Benny the dog was
frozen for three months

1179
01:45:49,668 --> 01:45:52,188
'and thawed out to live a normal life.

01:45:52,254 --> 01:45:56,233

01:45:59,804 --> 01:46:05,909
72 cryonised patients are currently
held at our facility in New Brunswick.

1183
01:46:05,976 --> 01:46:10,998
We feature the finest scientific
technicians on the planet.

1184
01:46:12,441 --> 01:46:15,836
- The book is "Life, The Sequel".
- McCabe!

1185
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:19,089
McCabe!

1186
01:46:20,616 --> 01:46:22,759
Come back!

1187
01:46:59,696 --> 01:47:04,843
Life Extension Corporation,
please. LE. We hold a court order.

1188
01:47:07,829 --> 01:47:10,307
I think I've been here before.

1189
01:47:22,844 --> 01:47:26,031
- Her name is Libby.
- Good morning, Mr McCabe.

1190
01:47:26,097 --> 01:47:29,534
I'm Libby. I'm here to assist you.

1191
01:47:31,269 --> 01:47:33,955
He's my son. He's very shy.

1192
01:47:34,022 --> 01:47:38,293
You're not with the media or
part of any legal consortium?

1193
01:47:40,153 --> 01:47:42,297
Welcome to Life Extension.

1194
01:47:42,363 --> 01:47:45,633
Take a look at our
proposal. Please follow me.

1195
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:48,303
You can wait out here.

1196
01:47:48,369 --> 01:47:52,807
You'll be meeting Rebecca
Dearborn, my personal role model.

1197
01:47:54,834 --> 01:47:57,812
'I didn't need the pain any more. '

1198
01:47:58,922 --> 01:48:01,315
'Life Extension wants you to live. '

1199
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:07,613
'I don't think that God
disapproves of this. '

1200
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,408
Cryonisation, a journey of reawakening

1201
01:48:10,475 --> 01:48:14,495
after the preservation of the human
body at extremely low temperatures.

1202
01:48:14,562 --> 01:48:17,748
- They laughed at Jules Verne, too.
- David, you are not...

1203
01:48:17,815 --> 01:48:20,751
Mr McCabe, how are you?
I'm Rebecca Dearborn.

1204
01:48:23,863 --> 01:48:28,050
Life Extension, or LE as
we like to refer to it,

1205
01:48:28,117 --> 01:48:33,639
is a glimpse of the future. A
ticket, not in the juvenile sense

1206
01:48:33,706 --> 01:48:38,853
but in the deeply meaningful sense that
can only be borne in the human heart.

1207
01:48:41,172 --> 01:48:44,316
The DNA codes of the human
body have been broken.

1208
01:48:44,383 --> 01:48:49,196
Soon heart ailments, cancer, so much
more will be a thing of the past.

1209
01:48:49,263 --> 01:48:54,034
Very simply, your anguish,
your discontent, even your death

1210
01:48:54,101 --> 01:48:57,329
is no longer necessary
in a traditional sense.

1211
01:48:57,396 --> 01:49:01,709
Whatever malady hides behind
that mask, it's temporary.

1212
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:08,132
Within an hour of your passing, LE
will transfer your body to a vessel

1213
01:49:08,199 --> 01:49:12,970
where you will be sealed and
frozen at 196 degrees below zero.

1214
01:49:13,037 --> 01:49:17,433
Power outages, earthquakes, nothing
will affect your suspension hibernation.

1215
01:49:17,499 --> 01:49:20,561
Have you signed a contract
with these people, David?

1216
01:49:24,131 --> 01:49:28,110
- What's the Lucid Dream option?
- Good choice.

1217
01:49:28,761 --> 01:49:32,447
The Lucid Dream is Life
Extension's newest option.

1218
01:49:32,514 --> 01:49:34,241
For a little extra,

1219
01:49:34,308 --> 01:49:40,455
we offer the cryonic union
of science and entertainment.

1220
01:49:41,565 --> 01:49:43,333
Cryotainment.

1221
01:49:47,321 --> 01:49:50,424
Some find this presentation helpful.

1222
01:49:57,581 --> 01:50:02,769
<i>I have a universe inside me...</i>

1223
01:50:02,836 --> 01:50:05,772
'Portrait of a modern human life.

1224
01:50:05,839 --> 01:50:10,610

1227
01:50:18,518 --> 01:50:21,371
'to continue your own
life as you know it now.

1228
01:50:21,438 --> 01:50:24,165
'LE offers you the answer.

1229
01:50:24,232 --> 01:50:30,046
'Upon resurrection, you will continue
in an ageless state, preserved,

'With no memory of how it

01:50:56,556 --> 01:51:00,159
'that everything simply improved.

01:51:00,894 --> 01:51:05,540
'Ln any instance of discontent,

'Lt's just around the corner.

1243
01:51:07,483 --> 01:51:12,922
'The day after tomorrow, another

'A living dream, Life

1245
01:51:17,785 --> 01:51:19,512
'Life part two. '

1246
01:51:20,038 --> 01:51:22,265
A living dream.

1247
01:51:24,333 --> 01:51:27,770
Your death will be
wiped from your memory.

1248
01:51:27,837 --> 01:51:30,398
I guess I missed that
one in "USA Today".

1249
01:51:30,465 --> 01:51:35,528
A dream. What if there was a mistake?

1250
01:51:36,888 --> 01:51:39,949
What if the dream became a nightmare?

1251
01:51:41,183 --> 01:51:45,788
Your subconscious can
always play tricks on you.

1252
01:51:46,522 --> 01:51:50,209
The subconscious is
a very powerful thing.

1253
01:51:53,487 --> 01:51:56,173
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1254
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:59,635
But this is a serious business.

1255
01:52:00,536 --> 01:52:03,764
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.

1256
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:08,769
And what is any life if
not the pursuit of a dream?

1257
01:52:08,836 --> 01:52:13,148
The dream of peace, the
dream of achievement,

1258
01:52:14,383 --> 01:52:17,569
the dream of hearing
someone say these words...

1259
01:52:17,636 --> 01:52:19,989
...when they truly mean them:

1260
01:52:23,017 --> 01:52:25,077
I love you, David.

1261
01:52:27,563 --> 01:52:29,623
- Te quiero.
- I love you.

1262
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:32,292
<i>And the way the sunlight
plays upon your hair...</i>

1263
01:52:33,694 --> 01:52:38,048
Roam free, David. Most
of us live our whole lives

1264
01:52:38,115 --> 01:52:42,678
without any real
adventure to call our own.

1265
01:52:42,745 --> 01:52:47,349
It's hard to comprehend, but
they laughed at Jules Verne, too.

1266
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:53,605
This is a revolution of the mind.

1267
01:52:53,672 --> 01:52:57,526
<i>I'm picking up good vibrations</i>

1268
01:53:15,610 --> 01:53:19,506
I want to wake up! Tech support!

1269
01:53:23,535 --> 01:53:26,096
It's a nightmare!

1270
01:53:42,846 --> 01:53:45,782
Tech support!

1271
01:54:00,905 --> 01:54:04,050
Tech support!

1272
01:54:40,945 --> 01:54:45,800
David Aames. I think it's time
we had a proper introduction.

1273
01:54:45,867 --> 01:54:49,011
I'm Edmund Ventura
from the Oasis project,

1274
01:54:49,078 --> 01:54:51,514
formerly Life Extension, LE.

1275
01:54:51,581 --> 01:54:55,518
- Tech support?
- Yes, I'm your tech support.

1276
01:54:55,668 --> 01:54:58,854
We first met 150 years ago.

1277
01:54:59,755 --> 01:55:03,776
Shit. You sold me the Lucid Dream.

1278
01:55:05,886 --> 01:55:10,074
- What the hell happened?
- I tried to warn you in the bar, David.

1279
01:55:10,141 --> 01:55:14,328
I told you that it all
depended on your mind.

1280
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:18,791
All of this, everything
is your creation.

1281
01:55:18,858 --> 01:55:21,794
Now we're heading towards
your true moment of choice.

1282
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:25,714
- True moment of choice?
- Yes.

1283
01:55:30,828 --> 01:55:32,888
When did the Lucid Dream begin?

1284
01:55:32,955 --> 01:55:36,350
- Do you remember the night club?
- We'll meet up soon.

1285
01:55:38,168 --> 01:55:41,897
That night, after Sofia left you
and you fell asleep on the pavement,

1286
01:55:41,964 --> 01:55:45,108
that was the moment that
you chose for the splice.

1287
01:55:45,175 --> 01:55:47,861
- Splice?
- Splice.

1288
01:55:47,928 --> 01:55:52,157
The end of your real life and
the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.

1289
01:55:52,224 --> 01:55:54,159
A splice of many years

1290
01:55:54,226 --> 01:55:57,287
which passed while you
were frozen and dreaming.

1291
01:55:57,354 --> 01:55:59,498
From the moment you woke up,

1292
01:55:59,565 --> 01:56:03,335
- nothing was real in the traditional sense.
- Open your eyes.

1293
01:56:03,402 --> 01:56:06,171
Your Lucid Dream is
monitored by Life Extension

1294
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:09,633
and a panel of experts
following your every thought,

1295
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:12,469
even at this moment.

1296
01:56:13,578 --> 01:56:15,889
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.

1297
01:56:20,168 --> 01:56:23,188
I'm not a big fan of heights.

1298
01:56:23,422 --> 01:56:25,273
I know.

1299
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:28,443
We erased what really
happened from your memory.

1300
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:30,737
- Erased?
- Replaced...

1301
01:56:30,804 --> 01:56:36,826
...by a better life, under these
beautiful, Monet-like skies.

1302
01:56:38,311 --> 01:56:43,541
- My mother's favourite.
- A better life because you had Sofia.

1303
01:56:44,067 --> 01:56:48,630
You sculpted your Lucid Dream out
of the iconography of your youth.

1304
01:56:48,697 --> 01:56:52,884
- An album cover that once moved you.
- An album cover?

1305
01:56:52,951 --> 01:56:57,472
'There are some things that you're not
old enough to understand just yet. '

1306
01:56:57,539 --> 01:57:01,601
A movie you saw once that showed
you what a father could be like.

1307
01:57:12,178 --> 01:57:14,447
Or what love could be like.

1308
01:57:14,806 --> 01:57:20,661
This was a kind woman, an
individual. More than your equal.

1309
01:57:21,604 --> 01:57:23,331
You barely knew her in your real life,

1310
01:57:23,398 --> 01:57:27,835
but in your Lucid Dream
she was your saviour.

1311
01:57:32,198 --> 01:57:35,510
What happened in my real
life? Something happened.

1312
01:57:35,576 --> 01:57:38,429
- What did you erase?
- Do you really want to know?

1313
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,517
Tell me everything.

1314
01:57:43,584 --> 01:57:48,397
The morning after the night club, you
woke up on the street, hungover and alone.

1315
01:57:48,464 --> 01:57:53,778
You got up and you walked
away. You never saw Sofia again.

1316
01:58:00,142 --> 01:58:01,994
I didn't kill Sofia.

1317
01:58:03,229 --> 01:58:05,206
No.

1318
01:58:05,272 --> 01:58:10,461
You battled your board, the Seven
Dwarfs, for control of the company.

1319
01:58:10,528 --> 01:58:13,380
In the end it was Thomas
Tipp, your father's friend,

1320
01:58:13,447 --> 01:58:17,635
who wrenched the company
back into your control.

1321
01:58:19,286 --> 01:58:21,430
Tommy.

1322
01:58:22,414 --> 01:58:24,433
But then...

1323
01:58:24,917 --> 01:58:27,561
...somebody died.

1324
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:32,524
You longed for Sofia.

1325
01:58:32,591 --> 01:58:36,403
You shut yourself away
for months. You were alone.

1326
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:39,782
You couldn't stand the pain
any more, the headaches.

1327
01:58:39,848 --> 01:58:44,745
- You could barely function.
- I found you on the Internet.

1328
01:58:48,065 --> 01:58:51,168
I signed a contract with you and then...

1329
01:59:12,673 --> 01:59:14,900
I remember.

1330
01:59:23,642 --> 01:59:25,911
Somebody died.

1331
01:59:27,437 --> 01:59:28,830
It was me.

1332
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:39,174
'And on a day in late December...

1333
01:59:39,783 --> 01:59:42,802
'... you gave yourself to us.

1334
01:59:43,787 --> 01:59:47,307
'You're now in a suspended state.

1335
01:59:50,669 --> 01:59:55,273
'Your friend Brian Shelby threw a
three-day memorial in your old home.

1336
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:57,942
'He was a true friend.

1337
02:00:06,768 --> 02:00:09,370
'You were missed, David.

1338
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:34,645
'Lt was Sofia who never fully recovered.

1339
02:00:35,922 --> 02:00:39,233
'Lt was she who somehow knew you best.

1340
02:00:39,884 --> 02:00:42,862
'Like you, she never
forgot that one night

1341
02:00:42,929 --> 02:00:46,657
'where true love seemed possible.

1342
02:00:54,607 --> 02:00:57,084
'Consequences, David.

1343
02:01:13,542 --> 02:01:15,978
'Lt's the little things. '

1344
02:01:19,799 --> 02:01:22,359
The little things.

1345
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:26,530
There's nothing bigger, is there?

1346
02:01:34,647 --> 02:01:38,542
Your subconscious did create problems.

1347
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:42,546
Your dream turned into a nightmare.

1348
02:01:42,738 --> 02:01:45,924
The glitch has been corrected.

1349
02:01:46,867 --> 02:01:49,720
So all I have to do
is imagine something?

1350
02:01:49,787 --> 02:01:53,932
Like if I wanted McCabe
to come back right now.

1351
02:01:57,461 --> 02:02:01,064
Listen to me. These
people are dangerous.

1352
02:02:02,257 --> 02:02:06,069
We're in trouble. We need
to get off this roof now.

1353
02:02:09,431 --> 02:02:13,744
We're now on pause, and you're
about to return to your Lucid Dream.

1354
02:02:13,810 --> 02:02:15,662
Pause?

1355
02:02:15,729 --> 02:02:20,792
You won't remember any of this, nor will
you be charged for technical support.

1356
02:02:20,859 --> 02:02:24,045
It's now your moment of choice.

1357
02:02:24,363 --> 02:02:29,176
You can return to your Lucid Dream
and live a beautiful life with Sofia

1358
02:02:29,242 --> 02:02:31,845
or whomever you wish.

1359
02:02:31,912 --> 02:02:35,140
Or you can choose the world out there.

1360
02:02:38,668 --> 02:02:40,020
The world out there?

1361
02:02:40,796 --> 02:02:44,983
And you can bring me back?
Just like Benny the dog?

1362
02:02:45,091 --> 02:02:48,653
Yes, just like Benny the dog.

1363
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:52,949
Your face and body can be fixed now,

1364
02:02:54,059 --> 02:02:59,748
but things are very different now.
And your finances won't last long.

1365
02:03:01,232 --> 02:03:05,462
Your panel of observers are
waiting for you to choose.

1366
02:03:09,407 --> 02:03:14,846
There are no guarantees. But
remember, even in the future,

1367
02:03:14,913 --> 02:03:19,559
the sweet is never as
sweet without the sour.

1368
02:03:38,353 --> 02:03:42,290
- How do I wake up?
- The decision is yours.

1369
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:50,756
I chose this scenario, didn't I?

1370
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:56,262
Yes, to face your last
remaining fear of heights.

1371
02:03:56,329 --> 02:03:58,306
David, don't listen to him.

1372
02:03:58,372 --> 02:04:01,309
This is the Seven
Dwarfs. It's a set-up!

1373
02:04:01,375 --> 02:04:04,145
You can't trust him.

1374
02:04:04,212 --> 02:04:08,065
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.

1375
02:04:08,132 --> 02:04:11,068
It's in his nature to
fight for his existence,

1376
02:04:11,135 --> 02:04:13,988
- but he's not real.
- I'm real.

1377
02:04:16,724 --> 02:04:20,494
I'm real. I have two daughters.

1378
02:04:20,561 --> 02:04:22,496
You know that.

1379
02:04:23,189 --> 02:04:24,790
What are their names?

1380
02:04:39,747 --> 02:04:41,473
I'm real.

1381
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:44,727
I'm...

1382
02:04:47,296 --> 02:04:52,234
Mortality as home entertainment?
This cannot be the future!

1383
02:04:53,927 --> 02:04:55,988
Can it?

1384
02:04:57,014 --> 02:04:59,158
Can it?

1385
02:05:26,918 --> 02:05:28,478
Goodbye.

1386
02:05:31,631 --> 02:05:38,405
It's been a journey of self-awakening.
Now you've got to ask yourself this.

1387
02:05:38,472 --> 02:05:40,949
What is happiness to you, David?

1388
02:05:47,981 --> 02:05:50,875
I want to live a real life.

1389
02:05:51,443 --> 02:05:53,837
I don't want to dream any longer.

1390
02:05:54,863 --> 02:05:56,965
Any last wishes?

1391
02:05:59,701 --> 02:06:03,221
Let them out there read my mind.

1392
02:06:04,164 --> 02:06:06,766
I wish you well, David.

1393
02:06:46,164 --> 02:06:50,768
Look at us. I'm frozen and you're dead.

1394
02:06:51,586 --> 02:06:53,729
And I love you.

1395
02:06:55,089 --> 02:06:57,525
It's a problem.

1396
02:07:00,553 --> 02:07:05,074
I lost you when I got
in that car. I'm sorry.

1397
02:07:07,852 --> 02:07:10,621
Do you remember what you told me once?

1398
02:07:11,564 --> 02:07:14,208
Every passing minute

1399
02:07:14,942 --> 02:07:18,462
is another chance to turn it all around.

1400
02:07:23,451 --> 02:07:25,928
I'll find you again.

1401
02:07:41,927 --> 02:07:44,655
I'll see you in another life...

1402
02:07:44,722 --> 02:07:46,782
...when we are both cats.

1403
02:08:59,170 --> 02:09:02,273
'Relax, David. Open your eyes. '
