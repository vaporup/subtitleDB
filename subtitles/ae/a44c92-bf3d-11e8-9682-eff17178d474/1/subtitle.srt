1
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,993
Once upon a time Kwok Ching
and his wife Wong Yung

2
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:42,710
were given a sword by Yueng Guo.

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,186
They melted it together with gold
and made two swords.

4
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:49,195
The first was named To Lung,
and the second Yee Tin.

5
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:53,389
All their knowledge, even about
the techniques of Ngo Fai

6
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:58,147
and the most powerful kung fu scroll
were hidden in the sword

7
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:02,315
The owner would rule
the world of martial arts.

8
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:32,067
To obtain these swords

9
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:35,512
both good and evil
fought many battles.

10
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:38,748
Two groups were formed.

11
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:42,989
The first being led by the Shaolin.

12
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:44,345
Shaolin.

13
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:45,784
Wu-tong.

14
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:46,786
Ngo-mai.

15
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:48,435
Kun-lun.

16
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,314
Hung-tung.

17
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:52,074
Wah-shan.

18
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:56,832
Their opponent was a sect
from Persia.

19
00:01:56,996 --> 00:02:01,148
The mysterious Ming sect
Called the Evil Cult by some.

20
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:06,589
This cult fought against the Yuen-dynasty
and the government, all the time

21
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:08,951
Their camp was stationed at the Bright Summit

22
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:13,229
The four leaders of the Cult
were extraordinary powerful

23
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,347
Being, Purple Dragon

24
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,707
White Eagle, Golden Lion

25
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:21,106
and Green Bat

26
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:25,628
The hatred was strong,
friendships amongst themselves were forbidden

27
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:31,985
Chang Tsui-san, the fifth pupil
of Chang San-fung, was righteous.

28
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:35,188
He didn't like these silly rules

29
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:39,105
and fell in love with Yan So-so,
daughter of White Eagle.

30
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:44,106
And started a friendship with Tse Shun,
Golden Lion.

31
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:54,514
Shing Kwun was the master
of Golden Lion

32
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:58,385
To get into the sect,
he killed Tse Chuns family

33
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,473
Tse Shun took the sword To Lung...

34
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:04,595
and killed many inoccents
out of revenge

35
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:12,791
Tsui-san en So-so didn't want to reveal
Tse Shuns hideout

36
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:16,631
and went to
The Island of Ice and Fire

37
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,310
to live in seclusion.

38
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:24,385
Tse Shun had the sword To Lung,
but not the secret of the sword.

39
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,986
Until the 100th birthday
of Chang San-Fung

40
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:32,906
Tsui-san took his wife and son
Mo-kei to his master

41
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:45,907
- Sugared Crab
- That's what I want

42
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:48,346
One please

43
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,792
- Enjoy it, Mo Kei
- Thank you

44
00:03:58,236 --> 00:03:59,794
You weren't coming

45
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:03,585
- This is about Wu-Tong, it's possible.
- Who knows.

46
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,792
They'd do anything for To Lung

47
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:09,392
Dad, what do they want
with godfathers sword?

48
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:16,513
Never name your godfather again

49
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:17,995
I won't do it again

50
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:23,350
Whoever asks for your godfather

51
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:26,707
and whatever they do,
don't say a word, OK?

52
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:30,346
Yes, because we can't betray our friend

53
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:34,344
- That wouldn't be righteous.
- Good boy

54
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:37,992
- The master must like you a lot.
- Is he nice?

55
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,586
He's the best

56
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,669
- Chang Tsui-san...
- It hurts

57
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,145
The Jinx-scream destroys your brain

58
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,314
Use your inner force,
or you'll go mad.

59
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:54,472
Where are you? Show yourself!

60
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:15,633
The Jinx-hand?

61
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:19,424
Mo-kei.

62
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,671
The infamouse jinxes

63
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,191
Chang, if you want your son back

64
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,956
tell me where Golden Lion is.

65
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:33,475
Dream on

66
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:36,309
If we hit your son
with the Jinx-hand...

67
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:38,666
- ...you know what will happen.
- How dare you

68
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:42,624
The child is innocent.
Why would you hurt him?

69
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:47,108
Let him go, the Wu Tong and the
Ming sect will appreciate it

70
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:50,114
Are you threatening me with
Wu-Tong and the Ming sect?

71
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,672
Even with that old Chang
they won't stand a chance

72
00:05:53,836 --> 00:05:55,554
Really?

73
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:57,990
- Master.
- Master.

74
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:01,632
I, Chang San-Fung,
ask you to let the boy go.

75
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:07,109
Well, well, the famous Chang San-Fung
is a fatso, I'm stunned

76
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:12,913
OK, my fame is a bit exaggerated.
Who cares?

77
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,188
Fatso, is you fear the Jinx-hand

78
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:19,149
Let him tell me
where Tse Chun is.

79
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,709
OK

80
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,707
Tsui-san, tell him

81
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:28,506
Master, Tse Shun is my friend.
It wouldn't be the right thing.

82
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:33,272
Indeed, we can't have let that happen.
You wouldn't be able to face anyone anymore

83
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,990
Please grant us our honour

84
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:42,066
Old man, step aside if if you fear death,
or you will die on your 100th birthday

85
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,673
Sighing won't do you no good

86
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:55,433
I turn 100 today.
I don't want to get mad

87
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:59,111
But you are forcing me.
I will teach you.

88
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:01,193
Brother

89
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:04,593
Hit the boy once,
and I will hit him 100 times.

90
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:08,795
Man, your master is a hothead.

91
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:11,345
He always has been.

92
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:16,505
- OK, we will release them both
at the same time - No tricks.

93
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:21,147
One, two, three

94
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:26,075
Mo-kei.

95
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,674
Mo-kei.

96
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,475
Watch out

97
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:48,351
- The Jinx-hand
- Mo-Kei

98
00:07:48,556 --> 00:07:52,868
Bring him to Shaolin. No, Wu-Tong.
I'll get an antidote

99
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:05,189
If we keep going like this, Mo-kei will die.
Stop.

100
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,072
How is he?

101
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:18,708
The Jinx-hand is powerful.
We'll have to wait for the antidote

102
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:24,712
- But Mo-Kei.
- Mom, it hurts so bad

103
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:26,787
Relax.

104
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:33,072
Here is some candy.
Take one if it hurts

105
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,585
It will make you forget the pain. OK?

106
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:41,752
Shaolin, Ngo-mai, Hung-Tung,
Wah-shan and Kun-lun...

107
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:46,194
want Chang to tell
where the Golden Lion is.

108
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,909
Today is my master's birthday

109
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:02,426
He didn't want a party
so we'll keep it small

110
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:09,070
Nice of you to come, we will
thank you later. Good bye.

111
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:15,191
We don't want to disturb master Chang

112
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:18,149
But he has to turn over Tsui-san to So-so

113
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:22,588
and tell where Golden Lion is.
Only after that we will leave.

114
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:28,752
Master No-mercy, do you think
you can ask for anything?

115
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:36,391
We want to take revenge on the Evil Cult.
We want Tse-Shun, no matter what

116
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:41,795
If you won't turn him over,
we will fight for it.

117
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:45,944
Your kung-fu seem fine.
Show me

118
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:01,073
Chang Tsui-san, come outside

119
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,864
or all the elders will be killed

120
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,990
Stop.
Master No-mercy, don't push it.

121
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:11,506
There you are with your wife.
Where is Tse Shun?

122
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:15,749
- I will not betray him
- Then you deserve it.

123
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,909
You are befriended with that killer

124
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:22,072
I will shake you awake

125
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:44,548
Slut

126
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:53,149
- You?
- Stupid nun.

127
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:02,915
- You
- Even with that sword you are nothing.

128
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:09,749
If your master weren't my best friend,
I would teach you a lesson

129
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:14,432
You are unworthy of Yee Tin.
I will save it for your master

130
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:18,111
He should send a better student
to get it

131
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:23,232
Chang San-fung, how dare you protect him?

132
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:28,624
If we attack
you are not capable to kill us all

133
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:32,789
If you are tired
you will be in trouble

134
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,628
Is that a threat?

135
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:39,000
Master, this is all my fault.
Let me take care of it

136
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:47,867
Well, arrange it than.
But if I have to, I will fight

137
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:56,785
Elderlings, you want to know
where my friend resides

138
00:11:56,956 --> 00:12:01,791
And you want his sword, To Lung,
to rule all alone

139
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:05,744
But I will never betray him

140
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,226
On his age, my master doesn't have to

141
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,792
put his life in danger for me

142
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:17,865
I will answer you now

143
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,076
- Tsui-san...
- Daddy...

144
00:12:56,556 --> 00:13:00,344
Why did you kill yourself?
Tsui-san...

145
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:06,831
Mama, why did he do it?

146
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:12,070
Mo-kei, remember all those faces

147
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:16,787
You have to remember each and every of them

148
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:20,949
They have been stained with his blood

149
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:24,785
Dad died because of them?

150
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:28,312
You have to revenge the death of your father

151
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,076
They will have to pay for it.

152
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:35,627
Miss Yan, the death of your husband
fills us with grief

153
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:41,234
But now you alone knows
where Tse-Shun is.

154
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:46,590
Come over here, master Hung Man,
I will tell u.

155
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:51,865
- But then you have to let us go.
- A monk is true to his word

156
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:55,824
I will tell you alone

157
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,310
Can you speak louder?

158
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:05,191
There you can find Golden Lion.

159
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:09,230
Go get the sword quickly

160
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,392
But where is it then? Miss

161
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,191
- She didn't say anything
- You want the sword for yourself.

162
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,068
Mama...

163
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:24,665
Mo-kei, mama tricked them.

164
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:28,715
Do you see the power of deceit

165
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:33,472
Always remember, never to trust a woman.

166
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:38,994
The prettier she is,
the better she can lie.

167
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,553
Mama...

168
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,389
- Master, we have to revenge them
- First save Mo-kei.

169
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,428
Mo-kei...

170
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:54,233
Master

171
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:59,715
- Your inner strength is great
- But you will not recover from your cold attacks.

172
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:04,188
If that cooking monk
hadn't jumped from here

173
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,194
he could have healed you
with his Solar stance

174
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:08,590
Solar stance?

175
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:13,307
Mysterious Shaolin kung-fu,
as powerfull as the Moon stance

176
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:16,269
But the parchment
has been lost for 300 years

177
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:22,711
A cooking monk in Shaolin
found it by accident in a Sutra

178
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:26,585
He learned the kung-fu
and got away with it

179
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,587
Then he dared me.

180
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:44,835
Chang, you are really good.

181
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:47,715
The Solar stance makes invincable

182
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:51,551
But you have to be a virgin
when you learn it

183
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:58,348
If I wouln't be invincable

184
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:01,354
why would I train so hard?

185
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,910
Chang San-fung, cya.

186
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:10,069
Completely nuts

187
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:14,265
If he were still alive
his kung-fu could have saved you

188
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:18,071
If you learn the kung-fu as a virgin
you are stronger

189
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:21,154
But nnow
I have a hard one every morning.

190
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:23,586
What?

191
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:28,268
- Why don't I have it?
- You are weak.

192
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:32,426
- Master
- What, Ching-su?

193
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:36,430
No-Mercy has send her student ChowChi-yu...

194
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:40,191
- ...to get Yee Tin
- Chow Chi-yu?

195
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:18,752
How are you doing, master Chang?

196
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,510
No-Mercy temper any better now?

197
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:25,589
She studies buddhism now,
and is improving

198
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,112
She is lucky with such a polite student

199
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,388
Mo-kei, give her Yee Tin.

200
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:41,272
Mo-kei, are you the son
of Chang Tsui-san?

201
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:42,989
I...

202
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:48,316
Yes, Mo-kei is the orphan of my uncle.
I am Sung Ching-su.

203
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:52,304
My father is the oldest
of the seven heroes of Wu-tong.

204
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,835
Thanks, brother Mo-kei

205
00:18:54,196 --> 00:19:00,431
Chi-yu, stay a couple of days.
Let Yuen Kiu teach you our swordplay.

206
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:02,393
Thank you, master Chang.

207
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,989
Brother Mo-kei.

208
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,266
Are you watching?

209
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:38,306
Master Chang loves you so much,
you will probably his succesor.

210
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:47,788
Don't be afraid, Mo-kei is not allowed to
learn kung-fu. We look after him

211
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:50,345
Sister Chi-yu, you want to practice together?

212
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:56,793
He has been hit by the Jinx-hand
and will never learn kung-fu

213
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,474
Father

214
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:08,312
Ching-su, The master wants to practice
the Tai-chi sword for three months

215
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:10,586
We will accompany him

216
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:16,195
You must take care of Wu-tong,
in the meanwhile

217
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:19,194
- Thank you, father.
- You have to work hard.

218
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:25,995
Mo-kei cannot learn kung-fu,
so you are responsible

219
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:30,707
Master Chang has made 100 pills
for Mo-kei, each day one

220
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:35,586
- For his cold-attacks
- Ching-su will look after him.

221
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:52,233
What is your business over there?

222
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:59,076
Mo-kei, what was that?

223
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:04,066
- Someone was peeking on you.
- Really?

224
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:08,593
- They are cruel. I am afraid.
- They already left.

225
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:12,635
I'm still afraid.
Would you stay with me?

226
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,511
I knew you wouldn't.

227
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:30,151
I would like to.

228
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:34,509
I know you like me.

229
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:37,065
- Are you warm?
- No.

230
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,909
You are sweating all over.

231
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:56,746
How dare you, you think you are
a real womanizer, don't you

232
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:15,632
- Ching-su, are you okay?
- I am in charge now.

233
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:37,991
You're to blame for your parents death.
Now your flattering master Chang

234
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:40,790
So that he helps you overcome your cold-attacks

235
00:22:40,956 --> 00:22:44,107
If I would get his energy
I would be kung-fu master now

236
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:46,910
- I curse your mother
- Shut up.

237
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:53,874
Is my uncle your father at all?
Or are you the son of a whore

238
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:05,826
- Brother Ching-su.
- Get him, I will chop his hand off.

239
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:11,834
Look, Wu-tong is no heroe after all.

240
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:16,308
- Friend, who are you?
- I am not your friend.

241
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:18,586
Get dressed.

242
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,553
Slut.

243
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,672
Come over here, if you dare

244
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:49,865
Wu-tongs kung-fu is nothing.
Ming is much stronger.

245
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:52,948
Chi-yu, attack her with Yee Tin.

246
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:55,511
- Biatch
- So, Yee-tin is here.

247
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:58,748
Run away for the Wu-tong dogs.

248
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:02,511
- Don't insult Wu-tong.
- You are insane.

249
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:04,234
We'll chat later

250
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:29,233
Biatch, feel the power of my sword.

251
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:38,391
Your sword is what I came for.
Can it break my chains?

252
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:40,791
Wu-tong, swordstance.

253
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,155
Go away.

254
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,787
Quickly, over here.

255
00:24:57,316 --> 00:25:00,388
- Your kung-fu is really lousy.
- Later.

256
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:03,349
They will kill you if they get us

257
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:11,115
Moron, this is a dead end.

258
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:15,784
Mo-kei, you mingled with Ming
and desacrated our temple

259
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:19,471
As leader of Wu-tong I cast you out.

260
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:21,433
Warriors of Wu-tong!

261
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:23,188
Show no mercy.

262
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,387
- I'm sorry, miss.
- Siu Chiu.

263
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:29,953
Are you seducing him now?
Where did you intend to go with him?

264
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,954
Nice and soft

265
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:06,425
- Why did you let go?
- But I taught them...

266
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:13,068
- Didn't your father teach you something?
- He died years ago.

267
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:18,264
Your name is Chang Mo-kei.
Is your father Chang Tsui-san?

268
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:22,431
- Your servant Siu Chiu.
- Get up.

269
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:26,714
I insulted White Eagle.
He put me in chains

270
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,710
Then I ran away
to get the Yee Tin sword.

271
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:36,985
- And fortunately you saved my life
- Get up, I'm not your master.

272
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,756
You touched me again.

273
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:44,186
As grandson of White Eagle,
you are my master.

274
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:49,233
I haven't seen him since my birth.

275
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,434
What is that sound, a monster?

276
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:58,510
Let's go

277
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:09,746
- This way
- No, that way

278
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:28,184
That I would get a visit in my time.

279
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,795
You are?

280
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:32,868
I am the soul of hell

281
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:37,393
- Are you a student of Wu-tong?
- I am Chang Mo-kei.

282
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:40,394
It has been long since I ate human flesh

283
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:45,590
Chang San-fung had me suffer,
so I can eat his student

284
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:51,945
- Are you the cooking monk?
- Do you still remember me?

285
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:57,867
The girl behind you is very pretty.
I bet she tastes a lot better.

286
00:27:58,036 --> 00:28:01,233
She doesn't belong to Wu-tong.
Eat me instead

287
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:07,073
And brave too.

288
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,425
Old man!

289
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:11,075
Heer...

290
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:16,396
- Master Chang, how are you?
- It is so cold.

291
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,827
What have you done to him?

292
00:28:20,996 --> 00:28:28,584
He was already wounded.
Who messed you up?

293
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:32,226
The Jinx-hand, eight years ago.

294
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:36,796
That one is fatal.

295
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:41,188
All these years master chang
must have given his energy to you

296
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,705
He surely must love you very much.

297
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:46,595
Old man, can you cure him?

298
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:50,066
Only my Solar-stance can help him.

299
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:53,314
But why would I cure Chan's people?

300
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:57,953
Chang Mo-kei,
if you call master Chang a bastard...

301
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:02,149
...I will teach you the Solar-stance

302
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:03,675
Never

303
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,906
Do you have to hit him as well?

304
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:14,507
Call Chang three times
a shameless bastard...

305
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:18,794
...and you will never again
suffer from colds.

306
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:22,995
On top of that, you will be invincable.

307
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,869
Simple, isn't it?

308
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:34,831
Say after me:
Chang is a shameless bastard.

309
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:39,592
A shameless bastard...

310
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,109
...are you.

311
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:45,195
Fine. We shall see
how you survive the night

312
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:48,473
Master

313
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:51,275
- So cold!
- Really cold?

314
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:58,107
And now? Still cold?

315
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:07,227
Better this way?

316
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:23,744
Impossible!
Master Chang having such a brave student

317
00:30:58,036 --> 00:31:00,231
I am still alive.

318
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:04,395
- Master, have you recovered?
- Siu Chiu...

319
00:31:04,716 --> 00:31:08,072
- Master, do you carry a weapon?
- No.

320
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:12,064
- Something is poking me.
- Really?

321
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:18,070
- Upright?
- What is it?

322
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,187
Nothing.

323
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:23,945
Damn, I hope she isn't pregnant.

324
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:26,716
- So fast?
- What did you say?

325
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,832
That I woke up very fast.

326
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:32,705
Master, if you survived yesterday
you will make it through.

327
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:34,912
Keep on dreaming.

328
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:42,794
Yesterday you were lucky.
You will suffer from three attacks a day.

329
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:47,986
If nobody passes energy to you,
you will die.

330
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:49,185
You mean...

331
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:53,184
Chang Mo-kei,
if you don't learn my Solar-stance...

332
00:31:53,396 --> 00:32:00,472
the rest of your life will be freezing.
Leave Wu-tong, become my student.

333
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:03,469
No, master Chang is good to me.

334
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:04,864
You are ill.

335
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:08,308
Why do you want him
to learn your kung-fu?

336
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:13,988
Ten years ago I was beaten
by Chang San-fung.

337
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:16,630
Im still pissed of because of that.

338
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:21,665
My student has to be better
than his students

339
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:23,508
Teach me instead.

340
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:26,713
If a woman learns the Solar-stance...

341
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:30,789
her breasts will vanish
and she will have hairy arms and legs

342
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:33,272
And a beard and a man's voice as well

343
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:36,866
- Would you like that?
- Never mind.

344
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:39,709
His back is broken.
He moves with that ball.

345
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,915
Promise him now
and withdraw that promise later on.

346
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:47,427
Wu-tong is just and sincere

347
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:50,793
Still he wants to learn me his kung-fu.
That is suspicious

348
00:32:50,956 --> 00:32:53,629
But I refuse.
You can not force me.

349
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:55,787
You think I cannot?

350
00:32:57,196 --> 00:32:58,629
Siu Chiu.

351
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:22,306
- Let me help you.
- I don't want to

352
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:33,630
The sun appears.
The blood flows backwards.

353
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:36,549
Don't put my arse against my head.

354
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:39,514
Air from the belly flows through the body

355
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:42,144
I'm about to break

356
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:49,271
Sea of blood, straight back, sun bathing.
Portal of life, Ken-Suk

357
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:06,228
Chang, you learned the first stage
of the Solar-stance

358
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:09,951
You know my kung-fu now!

359
00:34:10,156 --> 00:34:13,068
And you will never get rid of it.

360
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:16,635
I will force you to learn second stage.

361
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:22,189
Unless you die, or betray on Wu-tong.

362
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:30,066
He was too stupid to have the biatch.
Kill Mo-kei.

363
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:35,396
I was too late, but I could kill her
but not save Mo-kei.

364
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:39,145
Kill me instead, as compensation for
uncle Chang

365
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:41,187
Alright, I will kill you

366
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:45,674
This way we will not get Mo-kei back.
It is of no use.

367
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,986
Ching-su did all he can.

368
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:52,428
Poor Mo-kei.
Maybe it is better he died.

369
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:57,351
Shaolin wants us to join
and besiege Bright Summit

370
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,070
For peace and justice

371
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:04,195
Yuen Kiu, take the elders,
Ching-su and Chi-yu along with you.

372
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:05,715
Yes, master

373
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:19,786
The ninth stage, The Sun in Heaven.

374
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:38,794
Chang, now you've learned all stages
of the Solar-stance

375
00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:43,984
You now posses powerfull energy
and your injuries cured.

376
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:47,188
Nobody can beat you now.

377
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:50,305
Master, I suceeded.

378
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:54,551
Thank you, master.

379
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:57,788
So you wanted to learn it after all.
You have to suffer.

380
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:02,268
You didn't want to teach me nothing
but only wanted to beat my master

381
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:06,435
But I tricked you.

382
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:09,906
I have to revenge my parents.
Therefore I wanted to learn.

383
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:11,595
You sly fox.

384
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:17,109
Beautiful women are not to be trusted
nor are nice people

385
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:19,068
I will kill you.

386
00:36:19,236 --> 00:36:23,468
I have got your kung-fu.
How would you do that?

387
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:32,511
Look out, he is very powerful

388
00:36:57,596 --> 00:37:01,987
Old man, forgive me.
You have cured me.

389
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:06,792
- Thanks for your teachings
- You sly fox

390
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:10,000
When I have my revenge,
I will come and save you

391
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:17,435
We will see who drops dead first

392
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:22,431
You will never make it together.
It will not be a happy end.

393
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:40,229
I have made it through

394
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:45,146
Shaolin, Ngo-mai, Hung-tung,
Kwun-lun and Wah-shan...

395
00:37:45,356 --> 00:37:48,234
you are stained with
the blood of my parents

396
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,513
I will make you pay.

397
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:05,388
You have such a hard look in your eyes

398
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:09,589
If you would like I, for eight years,
saved on all you hatred

399
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,395
and suffered from continuous insults

400
00:38:12,596 --> 00:38:15,872
and being finally able to fight back,
you would have the same

401
00:38:16,036 --> 00:38:18,266
Are you returning to Wu-tong?

402
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:24,546
Ching-su is the only son of my uncle.
I can not kill him

403
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,393
I am not going to Wu-tong.

404
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:33,395
With the help of my Solar-stance
I can go wherever I want.

405
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:35,587
I am going to my grandfather

406
00:38:35,956 --> 00:38:38,231
- He can free you
- Thank you

407
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:41,587
We will be in danger together.
Do not call me Master

408
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:45,510
But I will be happy to serve you.
Will you allow me?

409
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:47,792
You are so kind to me

410
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:51,187
Now that you are so powerful,
all girls will fall for you

411
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,229
You will surely forget me soon.

412
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:57,906
As long as the sun shines
I will not let you go.

413
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,074
Master!

414
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:17,474
Sugared crab candies

415
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:22,586
Look, they sell sweets over there.

416
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:27,273
The last thing my mother bought me,
before the Jinx-hand hit me.

417
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:31,992
I got three to eat when I was in pain

418
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:38,715
- You ate the first after they died, right?
- This one I tried to keep.

419
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,872
Bring wine and food.

420
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:47,392
The six clans are launching a raid on Bright Summit.
I am sure they will destroy the evil Cult

421
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:52,306
If we are too late
we will miss the great moment

422
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:56,794
If we are in time,
we will be slaughtered as well

423
00:39:56,956 --> 00:40:01,791
There are the four masters and
the banner of the Five Invincable Elements

424
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:06,552
You think a small potato like you
could be victorious over them? Stupid monkey

425
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:09,469
She is sure to be with the Evil Cult.
Get her.

426
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:20,794
We have to hide.

427
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:32,512
You can not do anything here.

428
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:36,464
- She belongs to the Ming sect?
- I don't know her

429
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:41,391
Let us discuss the attack on Bright Summit.
I will do all I can.

430
00:40:47,596 --> 00:40:48,949
You know them?

431
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:52,592
Of course, it was them who
hit me with the Jinx-hand, eight years ago

432
00:40:52,756 --> 00:40:56,590
Stay calm, against those kung-fu masters.
We have no chance

433
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:58,553
- Mr. Deer.
- Hello.

434
00:40:58,716 --> 00:41:01,469
Master, we all depend on you

435
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:05,709
Please send my regards to His Highness.
See you

436
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:10,712
Who is hiding there?
Show yourself.

437
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:13,231
What are you doing there?

438
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:22,270
Kid, what are you looking at?

439
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:25,195
He seems to be familiar to us

440
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,786
Forget it, it is just a couple
that are enjoying themselves here.

441
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:30,548
Let's go

442
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,711
- I just wanted...
- Lucky you didn't do anything. Look.

443
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:58,394
He must be very influencial.
Even Mr. Deer and Mr. Crane are his companions

444
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:04,193
- He..., that is a woman.
- A woman? Like my mother?

445
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:09,424
- She is pretty, like your mother
- But so are you.

446
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:13,430
The Bright Summit is surrounded.
We have to go over there.

447
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:18,195
The evil sect is well prepared

448
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:25,268
The five elemental flags are all prepared.
Even Way Yat-siu, the green bat has come to help.

449
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,592
Even thought he is against
King of White Eagle

450
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:31,544
If the Queen of Purple Dragon
and the King of Golden Lion return...

451
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,071
it will become difficult for us

452
00:42:34,236 --> 00:42:39,310
If King of Golden Lion is back, that is perfect.
We can get his To Lung sword.

453
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:42,792
- Are you also interested in my Yee Tin sword?
- Yes of course

454
00:42:42,956 --> 00:42:45,072
I would not dare.

455
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:51,505
She can read my mind, but she does not
know I want to rape her.

456
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:55,589
OK. If you rape her,
I will take her students.

457
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:58,828
- What a hard job, pal
- My pleasure

458
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,952
What are you two talking about?

459
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:03,954
We decided to donate the treasure
of the Evil Cult to the poor

460
00:43:04,156 --> 00:43:06,750
Queen of the Purple Dragon
is the holy lady of the Ming sect

461
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:09,476
She disappeared many years ago.
I believe she went to Persia

462
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:15,791
After a severe fight, King of Golden Lion
was blinded. He won't be difficult to handle.

463
00:43:15,956 --> 00:43:19,995
But King of White Eagle and King of Green Bat
will not be so easy

464
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:24,235
- Uncle, I have an idea.
- Speak.

465
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:29,988
King of White Eagle has a grandson,
the son of Chang Tsui-san.

466
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:32,107
His name is Chang Mo-kei.

467
00:43:32,316 --> 00:43:34,625
He died months ago.

468
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:39,631
King of White Eagle does not know this.
He is an old man.

469
00:43:39,796 --> 00:43:44,506
He will be very happy
if he meets his grandson again

470
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:50,194
If this grandson attacks suddenly
he will have a great chance to kill him

471
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:51,749
Great idea.

472
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:55,192
We will kill and rob king of White Eagle
and King of Green Bat

473
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:57,114
We will sell all the women as hookers

474
00:43:57,316 --> 00:44:00,308
We are from honourable martial arts schools.
We will not do something so low as that

475
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:03,952
I will not allow you
to use my passed nephew

476
00:44:04,316 --> 00:44:07,308
We just want to help the poor.

477
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:11,589
I agree with master Yuen Chun.

478
00:44:11,956 --> 00:44:15,426
You asked someone to act as Mo-kei?
Who is the most suitable person then?

479
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:17,906
The son of Mr. Sung is the best choice

480
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:21,392
I won't allow a student of Wu-tong
to do something as disgraceful as this

481
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:26,829
While you're planning devious tricks
watch out for you can be struck by lightning

482
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:41,586
A bat's dart, the green bat,
Wai Yat-siu.

483
00:44:44,676 --> 00:44:47,395
Wai, let my wife go.

484
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:50,668
Your wife is so fat, it is no big deal
to suck her blood

485
00:44:50,836 --> 00:44:52,394
Dammit.

486
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,066
Sister No-mercy, you have killed my wife.

487
00:45:00,236 --> 00:45:04,229
If someone is bitten by Wai Yat-siu
one will lose his mind and obey him alone.

488
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,950
If I would not have killed her
we would have had an extra enemy.

489
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:09,795
You can not compete with her,
she is too strong

490
00:45:10,956 --> 00:45:14,869
Wai does not know the power of Yee-Tin yet.
He used Mrs. Ho as a shield.

491
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:17,709
But I believe he is hurt
by the energy of my sword

492
00:45:26,836 --> 00:45:29,350
Your Highness.

493
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:40,391
Are the six clans already near the mountain?

494
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:44,225
Your Highness, they have arrived

495
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:48,065
Raise the five elements
when they are halfway up...

496
00:45:48,236 --> 00:45:52,388
- Half of them should die.
- Yes.

497
00:45:53,636 --> 00:45:55,513
I have returned.

498
00:45:56,956 --> 00:45:58,787
Your Highness.

499
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:02,710
Green Bat, I am happy you came to help.
This means you are loyal to your sect

500
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:08,075
Old man, I got some information for you.
And I fought with No-mercy too.

501
00:46:08,236 --> 00:46:10,670
Her Yee-tin sword is really powerful

502
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:14,153
- Are you alright
- Of course I am alright

503
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:16,267
Set up the positions now.

504
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:21,550
And if someone who claims to be the grandson
of White Eagle, named Mo-kei, kill him.

505
00:46:21,716 --> 00:46:23,707
What did you say?
My grandson?

506
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:28,631
They will send someone
to act as your grandson to assasinate you

507
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:32,994
If your Holy Fire Tablet is still there
I am not afraid of Yee-Tin

508
00:46:33,196 --> 00:46:36,233
Bullshit, if master Yeung
wouldn't have been there with his magic stance

509
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:40,588
She would have killed everyone easily

510
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:45,987
- Ights, this damn hurts.
- Are you wounded?

511
00:46:46,196 --> 00:46:50,075
Of course, but I can't lose my face
in front of them.

512
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:55,390
- I will cure your injuries
- Useless, you have to suck out the poison.

513
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:57,473
- No Problem
- Really?

514
00:46:57,636 --> 00:47:04,075
- Yes, I am true to my word.
- Friend, here is the wound.

515
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:09,907
It is alright if you don't have to suck,
but you also don't have to kick me.

516
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:27,869
There's many of them

517
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:31,915
- They are not of the Ming Sect
- What kind of banners are those?

518
00:47:32,996 --> 00:47:36,671
They are my clan's, they are now entering
the forbidden zone of the five elements.

519
00:47:36,836 --> 00:47:38,554
Five elements?

520
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:43,829
Don't retreat, we are from decent schools.
We are no cowards

521
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:49,426
- If you want to be a coward, then die
- You are right

522
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:52,872
- After you
- Chi-yu, Give me Yee Tin.

523
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:54,385
Yes, master

524
00:49:06,796 --> 00:49:08,309
Go!

525
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:16,550
Let's retreat.

526
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,709
After them

527
00:51:37,716 --> 00:51:40,594
I am Siu Chiu,
the maid of King of White Eagle

528
00:51:41,156 --> 00:51:42,475
And this is his grandson,
Chang Mo-kei.

529
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:44,945
- Are you Mo-kei?
- Yes I am.

530
00:51:45,156 --> 00:51:49,149
King of White Eagle wants everyone who
calls himself Mo-kei to be killed.

531
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,709
Run!

532
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:00,390
Quickly, this way

533
00:52:26,116 --> 00:52:27,265
I am Chang Mo-kei.

534
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:28,670
Kill him.

535
00:52:30,276 --> 00:52:32,995
You are fighting the wrong one

536
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,148
Great Solar Stance

537
00:53:11,676 --> 00:53:15,146
Well done.
Hero, to which school do you belong?

538
00:53:17,676 --> 00:53:20,065
Master, that is Chang Mo-kei.

539
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:33,195
The son of Chang Tsui-san?

540
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:35,114
How did he become so powerful

541
00:53:35,636 --> 00:53:36,546
Where are you taking me?

542
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:40,106
This is the forbidden zone
of the Ming Sect.

543
00:53:41,436 --> 00:53:42,915
Are we going inside?

544
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:44,913
Only a master will survive that.

545
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:47,676
If he would die outside
the ones who carry his corpse...

546
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:50,470
Should commit suicide in there.

547
00:53:50,636 --> 00:53:52,467
What about you?

548
00:53:52,636 --> 00:53:55,708
The king does not allow his maid
to join his sect

549
00:53:56,116 --> 00:53:57,231
Freeze!

550
00:53:57,436 --> 00:53:58,585
Time to go.

551
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:04,150
Don't you move a step more
you will suffer a terrible death

552
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:07,348
If w stay here, we will come to
a terrible end, you fool

553
00:54:11,436 --> 00:54:13,552
Commander, what do we have to do?

554
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:15,468
This is the grave of the masters

555
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:18,946
It is riddled with traps
if they go in, they will surely be killed

556
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:21,147
Let's go back and help the others

557
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:40,995
What is the matter?

558
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:43,346
- I am afraid
- You don't have to be.

559
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:45,228
Look, these are only skulls

560
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:48,394
I think they belong tho the ones
who carried the corpse

561
00:54:48,596 --> 00:54:49,949
Let's leave this place

562
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:51,475
We are surrounded by Flag-soldiers

563
00:54:51,636 --> 00:54:56,835
I don't want to hurt my grandfathers men
with my kung-fu

564
00:54:56,996 --> 00:54:59,000
I don't have a choice but to continue

565
00:54:59,556 --> 00:55:02,753
I know there is a way to Bright Summit

566
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:10,991
You are only a maid of White Eagle.
How come you know all these things?

567
00:55:11,196 --> 00:55:13,505
I heard it, thus I know.

568
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:16,310
My grandfather locked you with
such a strong and heavy chain

569
00:55:16,476 --> 00:55:18,512
He probably had his reasons to do so

570
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:21,310
- Who are you, are you deceiving me?
- Don't you trust me?

571
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:22,750
I want to know the truth

572
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,953
I made an oath not to tell anything

573
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,112
I did not want to hurt your grandfater

574
00:55:27,276 --> 00:55:28,709
And I will not hurt you either

575
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:31,072
Let me keep my secret.

576
00:55:31,236 --> 00:55:34,512
I promise I will tell you,
when the time is ready

577
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,991
Alright, we'll discuss later

578
00:55:43,636 --> 00:55:46,196
There are tracks on the floor

579
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:55,674
Yeung, you are the master
of the Evil Cult. So what?

580
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:58,031
You took my beloved.
So what?

581
00:55:58,196 --> 00:56:02,508
I never thought you would die in here

582
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:05,150
I, Shing Kwun, now use the Six schools

583
00:56:05,316 --> 00:56:07,307
to destroy your Evil Cult

584
00:56:07,476 --> 00:56:12,391
And now I also want your Magic stance

585
00:56:12,556 --> 00:56:14,672
Then I will be invincable.

586
00:56:14,836 --> 00:56:18,272
And I will become
the head of the Yuen-dynastie.

587
00:56:18,596 --> 00:56:20,666
Even without the sword To Lung...

588
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:24,346
I will be the supreme master of martial arts

589
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:27,588
The master of the Ming sect disappeared
20 years ago, he died right here.

590
00:56:27,796 --> 00:56:31,391
This must be Shin Kwun.
The enemy of my god-father

591
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:33,308
He became the dog of the Yuen government

592
00:56:33,476 --> 00:56:35,592
He got the six schools
to attack the Ming Sect

593
00:56:35,796 --> 00:56:37,434
and dragged my god-fathers family to death

594
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:38,990
Who is there?

595
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:41,990
Chang Mo-kei.

596
00:56:42,196 --> 00:56:43,470
You did not die?

597
00:56:43,636 --> 00:56:46,594
Why do you hate the Ming sect
and my father?

598
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,985
Why did you kill them?

599
00:56:48,316 --> 00:56:52,309
Yeung Ting-lin stole away my loved one

600
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,671
I have done it for years
with his wife

601
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:56,548
At last he discovered it

602
00:56:56,756 --> 00:56:59,509
That is why he became mad.
He wanted to kill me

603
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:04,028
My love wanted to save me
and comitted suicide

604
00:57:04,196 --> 00:57:06,585
For 20 years I've hidden in Shaolin

605
00:57:06,836 --> 00:57:09,589
Just waiting for my chance
to destroy the Ming sect

606
00:57:09,836 --> 00:57:13,545
You seduced his wife and ruined his Evil sect?
Is that fair?

607
00:57:13,756 --> 00:57:15,587
What a shame.

608
00:57:15,796 --> 00:57:18,594
No matter if it is right or wrong

609
00:57:18,796 --> 00:57:21,674
Don't dare to criticize me

610
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:26,035
Chang Mo-kei, I will send you
to your parents

611
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:27,424
You will die.

612
00:57:43,996 --> 00:57:45,873
What kind of kung-fu is that?

613
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:47,595
Great Solar stance

614
00:57:47,796 --> 00:57:51,709
I never imagined you could beat me

615
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:54,874
In fact,
Chang Tsui-san had a secret.

616
00:57:55,236 --> 00:57:56,715
What is it?

617
00:58:04,716 --> 00:58:08,550
Get away, I will try to break it with my
Great Solar Stance

618
00:58:16,956 --> 00:58:19,595
Master, don't use your Solar Stance

619
00:58:19,836 --> 00:58:21,588
I am afraid everything will collapse

620
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,474
Do we have to die here then?

621
00:58:23,636 --> 00:58:25,786
No, we have to find another exit.

622
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:46,747
Here are some inscriptions

623
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:51,754
Those who come here
should bow for the skeleton

624
00:58:51,956 --> 00:58:54,595
If not, the soul will trouble you

625
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:57,105
If we are going to die, we will be souls too

626
00:58:57,276 --> 00:59:00,109
We don't need to be afraid

627
00:59:00,276 --> 00:59:01,311
Maybe it will be of any help

628
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:05,230
We should respect the dead
and bow to them

629
00:59:05,396 --> 00:59:07,671
Master Yeung.
Sorry to disturb your rest

630
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:11,749
Help us escape and we will
revenge you and kill Sing Kwun

631
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,265
What does it say?

632
00:59:27,436 --> 00:59:29,188
- Persian
- Can you read it?

633
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:30,028
Of course

634
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:33,950
Those who bow to me,
will get my Magic Stance

635
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:36,051
Those who mastered it,
can push the stone away

636
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,350
Then you will reach the Bright Summit

637
00:59:39,516 --> 00:59:43,350
The Magic Stance is inscribed on the rock

638
00:59:45,396 --> 00:59:47,512
He was very wise

639
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:52,232
He knew Shing Kwun would never bow to him
so he designed such a trap

640
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:54,193
Try it, so we can leave this place

641
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:58,554
It is not right to steal the secret kung-fu
of the Ming sect

642
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:02,544
Here it sais
you have to pass a message from Yeung

643
01:00:02,756 --> 01:00:04,792
He wants King of Golden Lion
to be his successor

644
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:07,511
He must also guard the Magic Scroll

645
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:10,184
and acquire the Holy Fire Tablet

646
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,108
Your god-father is his successor

647
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,028
So you are to learn their kung-fu

648
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:16,994
But how long does it take?

649
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:20,711
It sais for ordinary people
it takes 30 years or more.

650
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:24,745
Great kung-fu masters
can manage it in six hours

651
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:27,545
I already know the Solar Stance.
I can do it in six hours

652
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:29,235
Go ahead then.

653
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:36,554
King of Green Bat, are you hurt?

654
01:00:36,756 --> 01:00:39,224
Don't waste it.

655
01:00:39,396 --> 01:00:41,751
Where are all the women

656
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:43,469
Over there

657
01:00:45,236 --> 01:00:46,988
Do you want me to drink your blood?

658
01:00:47,196 --> 01:00:50,506
- We are the red cross
- We come to save people

659
01:00:54,876 --> 01:00:56,195
He is bleeding

660
01:00:57,756 --> 01:00:59,155
Let's get him

661
01:01:01,076 --> 01:01:02,191
You are saving people?

662
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:04,995
- Only nymphomaniacs
- and those who reincarnated wrongly

663
01:01:05,196 --> 01:01:06,072
How?

664
01:01:06,236 --> 01:01:08,989
We kill them to let them
reincarnate again

665
01:01:11,516 --> 01:01:14,713
If I wasn't wounded
I would have killed you myself

666
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:38,351
Old bluffer,
I have stopped the bleeding for you

667
01:01:38,516 --> 01:01:42,111
King of White Eagle,
you are really unbeatable

668
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:45,552
- We will pursue no further
- But dad, he is injured.

669
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:47,075
Why don't you kill him

670
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,591
He fought against five, and won

671
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:52,594
If he manages to do that,
how can we call ourselves heroes

672
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:53,985
Stop

673
01:01:57,836 --> 01:01:59,667
What's the matter?
You don't attack?

674
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:02,191
- We, Wha Shan school will attack now
- Deliver all your rings and jewelry here.

675
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:05,234
- Women undress now
- If not you will be killed

676
01:02:05,396 --> 01:02:09,105
It is really unbelievable

677
01:02:09,276 --> 01:02:12,154
to be bullied by such jerks

678
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,955
Old bluffer, let's fight together

679
01:02:15,156 --> 01:02:17,147
For our beloved sect

680
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,552
This is the end.
Go with your sister, Chi-yu

681
01:02:21,756 --> 01:02:23,951
Kill all the people of the Evil Cult

682
01:02:24,156 --> 01:02:27,546
and extinguish their holy fire

683
01:02:30,156 --> 01:02:31,350
Yes, master

684
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:36,586
King of White Eagle.
You are a great kung fu master

685
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:40,584
Your Eagle Claw Stance is famous.
Like the Dragon Claw of Shaolin

686
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:42,673
You'd better commit suicide.

687
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:52,149
Old bluffer, don't be so impulsive

688
01:03:03,716 --> 01:03:05,547
Listen

689
01:03:05,756 --> 01:03:08,589
I, Chang Mo-kei ask you to
stop your fighting for a moment

690
01:03:08,796 --> 01:03:10,673
You are not dead?

691
01:03:10,836 --> 01:03:13,191
Is he the son of So-So?
Your grandson?

692
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,709
Thank you for your attention

693
01:03:15,236 --> 01:03:17,386
The battle between Ming
and the six schools

694
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:20,024
is a trap set by Shing Kwun, master of Tse Hun

695
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:21,265
Please keep calm, and do not fall for it.

696
01:03:21,436 --> 01:03:24,314
Bullshit, evil cult is so cruel

697
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:26,353
Wai Yat-siu is a bloodthirsty maniac

698
01:03:26,516 --> 01:03:28,586
Tse Hun killed many people as well.
They deserve to die

699
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:30,235
Yes, I need blood for practicing

700
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,547
Chickenblood, pigblood and my own only

701
01:03:32,756 --> 01:03:36,669
It was you who killed Ho of the Kwun-lun school.
I did not bite her.

702
01:03:37,076 --> 01:03:40,546
About manslaughter, old nun,
you killed more than I did

703
01:03:40,756 --> 01:03:42,314
How dare you?

704
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:45,070
Shing Kwun serves Yuen.
He wants us to kill ourselves

705
01:03:45,236 --> 01:03:46,555
Believe me, master

706
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:49,316
And where is Shing Kwun now?

707
01:03:49,476 --> 01:03:52,229
For 20 years he has been hiding
with the Shaolin

708
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:54,148
He wears a mask.

709
01:03:57,756 --> 01:04:01,465
How dare you frame my uncle Yeun Chun

710
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:02,546
Where is Yeun Chun now?

711
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,065
He sneaked into the graveyard
to steal the Magic Scroll

712
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:07,033
He killed master Yeung.

713
01:04:07,196 --> 01:04:09,187
Siu Chiu, make yourself clear.

714
01:04:09,356 --> 01:04:12,268
Grandfather,
I will no let anyone hurt you

715
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,586
You have insulted Shaolin.
Your mouth is too big

716
01:04:14,796 --> 01:04:17,594
Try my Dragon Stance

717
01:04:19,276 --> 01:04:22,074
Mater, would you let us go,
if I can beat you?

718
01:04:24,756 --> 01:04:26,428
Deal.

719
01:04:28,756 --> 01:04:30,314
Go ahead

720
01:04:57,076 --> 01:05:01,991
The Dragon Claw stance is more powerful
than our own kung-fu

721
01:05:41,796 --> 01:05:43,752
This guy is really very powerful

722
01:05:44,116 --> 01:05:47,028
If I make 6000 points
he has at least 10.000

723
01:06:02,476 --> 01:06:03,670
Dragon Claw stance

724
01:06:14,396 --> 01:06:16,705
OK, I will stop fighting now

725
01:06:17,116 --> 01:06:20,188
I just come to stop your fighting
not to create any more trouble

726
01:06:20,516 --> 01:06:24,065
By the way, I used Shaolin kung-fu.
It is not an insult at all

727
01:06:24,396 --> 01:06:25,590
Please forgive me.

728
01:06:27,596 --> 01:06:28,790
Alright, let's go

729
01:06:37,476 --> 01:06:41,594
Chang Mo-kei, I challenge you.

730
01:06:41,836 --> 01:06:43,155
They have pushed my father to his death.

731
01:06:43,316 --> 01:06:45,591
Now they come to slaughter people
for no reason at all.

732
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,713
I have to revenge my father.

733
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:54,755
No, if I fight now, I will fall into
the trap of Shing Kwun

734
01:06:55,076 --> 01:06:58,512
I have te keep my calm, be wise in my fight
against the government

735
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:00,752
Watch out for her sword

736
01:07:01,156 --> 01:07:03,306
Right, don't fight her.

737
01:07:03,476 --> 01:07:05,068
Master, please go ahead

738
01:07:09,756 --> 01:07:10,745
Magic Stance

739
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:16,588
Damn you, ugly nun

740
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:19,590
- Siu Chiu
- Yes

741
01:07:26,436 --> 01:07:27,789
Thank you master

742
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:34,551
Brother Mo-kei, I had to betray you.
Please forgive me

743
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:36,553
I never minded that

744
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:39,395
Please, bring this sword to your master

745
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,145
Anybody else want to challenge me?

746
01:07:45,596 --> 01:07:46,995
Chi-yu.

747
01:07:50,516 --> 01:07:51,665
Brother

748
01:08:00,836 --> 01:08:02,349
Don't die

749
01:08:06,876 --> 01:08:08,673
Mo-kei.

750
01:08:08,836 --> 01:08:12,272
Let's attack them together.
We can beat them

751
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:14,552
This girl is so pretty

752
01:08:14,756 --> 01:08:16,587
Rape her.

753
01:08:18,276 --> 01:08:21,666
Who dares to take advantage of her
is the enemy of Wu-tong.

754
01:08:22,076 --> 01:08:25,193
- A little misunderstanding...
- We will call for some whores

755
01:08:25,356 --> 01:08:29,986
- We will not rape her
- Let's go, you bastard

756
01:08:32,756 --> 01:08:37,546
Master, don't die.
Don't leave me

757
01:08:37,756 --> 01:08:40,270
I have got the Solar Stance.
I will not die

758
01:08:40,436 --> 01:08:43,667
But this week,
I cannot use kung-fu again

759
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:46,344
Please rest, Mo-kei.

760
01:08:46,516 --> 01:08:48,347
Pay a visit to master Chang, when possible

761
01:08:48,516 --> 01:08:51,553
By helping you, we betrayed
the other five schools

762
01:08:51,756 --> 01:08:53,394
We should leave soon

763
01:08:53,556 --> 01:08:56,468
Or they will think
we support the Evil Cult

764
01:08:56,636 --> 01:08:59,708
So what, who knows, he might
save Wu-tong one day

765
01:09:00,116 --> 01:09:02,027
- Watch out, you.
- Ching-su.

766
01:09:02,196 --> 01:09:08,146
Uncle, bring the sword Yee-Tin
to master Chang.

767
01:09:08,316 --> 01:09:10,546
Be sure Sister No-Mercy don't get it

768
01:09:10,756 --> 01:09:12,474
- Alright
- Master

769
01:09:12,636 --> 01:09:15,230
- Let's go
- Be careful

770
01:09:16,436 --> 01:09:17,585
Master

771
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:22,664
Yau Tin-tsing, Wai Yat-siu and the five
elements greet master Chang.

772
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,987
I am not your master

773
01:09:25,196 --> 01:09:28,666
The one using the Magic stance
is our master

774
01:09:29,076 --> 01:09:30,714
The sects were divided all these years
in two groups.

775
01:09:31,116 --> 01:09:35,314
The Golden Lion and the Purple Dragon

776
01:09:35,476 --> 01:09:37,467
They were competing for leadership

777
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:39,354
You have saved us

778
01:09:39,516 --> 01:09:41,552
Who could be a better master than you?

779
01:09:41,756 --> 01:09:45,431
Master Yeung wanted my godfather
to be his successor

780
01:09:45,596 --> 01:09:48,474
You or your godfather.
It does not matter

781
01:09:51,476 --> 01:09:52,591
Your highness

782
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:56,192
The Wah-shan School is returning.
They want to launch an attack.

783
01:09:56,516 --> 01:09:59,553
Goddamn, the bastard

784
01:09:59,756 --> 01:10:02,429
I am Chu Yuen-chang.

785
01:10:02,596 --> 01:10:07,954
The time is running out.
We are waiting for your orders

786
01:10:08,156 --> 01:10:12,991
There are many casualties. Hide yourself
on the graveyard. What are you thinking?

787
01:10:13,196 --> 01:10:17,553
If you want to be our master,
we will do anything you say

788
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:21,988
Listen, followers.
Hide yourself on the graveyard

789
01:10:22,196 --> 01:10:26,553
When we have recovered,
we'll have our revenge

790
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:29,395
Bravo, holy master

791
01:10:53,836 --> 01:10:56,191
Wonderful, nicely done

792
01:10:56,356 --> 01:11:00,554
It is a really a blessing
to have you as our master

793
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,714
I just have the the position
of my grandfather temporarily

794
01:11:04,116 --> 01:11:05,708
Can I speak freely?

795
01:11:06,076 --> 01:11:09,751
Although you did not want
to be our master at first...

796
01:11:10,116 --> 01:11:15,349
...I saw in your eyes
you wanted to become our master

797
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:19,475
We have so many followers
and we battle against the government

798
01:11:19,636 --> 01:11:21,354
We have great strength

799
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:24,667
and you want to have your revenge

800
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:29,547
When you become master, your chances
of getting revenge will become much larger

801
01:11:29,756 --> 01:11:32,748
Then you can overthrow the Yuen-dynasty
and become Emperor yourself

802
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:35,545
- The chance is big
- Bullshit

803
01:11:35,756 --> 01:11:39,431
King of White Eagle is old and
King of Green Bat is unpredictable

804
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:43,589
You have no much use of them.
Whatever happens...

805
01:11:43,836 --> 01:11:47,545
...You can count on me.
I support you

806
01:11:47,756 --> 01:11:51,112
I see the ambition in your eyes

807
01:11:51,276 --> 01:11:55,667
As my right-hand you will have
your succes much faster

808
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:58,674
You are very wise.
I would surely like to be master

809
01:11:58,836 --> 01:12:03,273
But wise people are usually disgusting

810
01:12:03,436 --> 01:12:06,109
- I understand
- Be gone

811
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:20,108
Let's leave this place

812
01:12:20,276 --> 01:12:23,348
Wah-shan is a good school,
but you are scum

813
01:12:23,516 --> 01:12:26,588
Let us live...
I know a secret.

814
01:12:26,796 --> 01:12:27,672
Tell!

815
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,355
We overheard lately

816
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:33,429
that students of Wu-tong
have been attacked by Shaolin.

817
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:35,154
They all got caught

818
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:38,228
They have been kidnapped
but not raped.

819
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:45,034
Master, we have discovered that mr Yang is hurt.
He lays ahead

820
01:12:45,196 --> 01:12:46,754
- Uncle Yan
- Master

821
01:12:48,836 --> 01:12:50,508
- Mo-kei.
- How are you?

822
01:12:50,716 --> 01:12:53,674
On the way to Wu-tong
we saw Shaolin-monks

823
01:12:53,876 --> 01:12:57,949
They poisoned us with the vapour

824
01:12:58,156 --> 01:13:00,431
That is the strongest weapon in battle

825
01:13:00,596 --> 01:13:03,713
Whoever smells or eats it,
loses his kung-fu and strength

826
01:13:04,116 --> 01:13:05,947
There is an antidote that can save him

827
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:09,990
I held my breath
so that I could escape

828
01:13:10,196 --> 01:13:15,224
My brothers have all been captured
and taken away

829
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:18,593
Then I ran into two monks,
which were so very powerful...

830
01:13:18,796 --> 01:13:22,471
...that I was beaten.
They broke all my joints

831
01:13:22,636 --> 01:13:23,955
What a cruelty

832
01:13:24,156 --> 01:13:26,670
Let us free our uncles in Shaolin

833
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,669
Sold out, ask further on

834
01:13:29,836 --> 01:13:31,189
I will do so.

835
01:13:32,756 --> 01:13:38,547
All the doctors are occupied and all
the herbs are bought by one man.

836
01:13:38,756 --> 01:13:40,314
Weird

837
01:13:40,476 --> 01:13:41,670
Maybe those monks

838
01:13:42,196 --> 01:13:45,950
No, they live closeby
in the mansion with the green willow

839
01:13:46,156 --> 01:13:49,148
They know we need those herbs
to save Yan

840
01:13:49,316 --> 01:13:51,034
This must be a trap

841
01:13:51,196 --> 01:13:52,549
The green willow?

842
01:14:00,756 --> 01:14:02,587
Welcome.

843
01:14:02,836 --> 01:14:04,349
The master is expecting you already

844
01:14:04,516 --> 01:14:09,431
- May I know his name?
- You will learn it soon

845
01:14:15,156 --> 01:14:18,592
Did you want to trap us?
Speak up, or I will suck your blood

846
01:14:18,796 --> 01:14:21,515
The blood of my men
does not taste well

847
01:14:21,716 --> 01:14:27,268
If you want,
I have some fresh blood for you

848
01:14:27,436 --> 01:14:30,587
Why won't you say who you are?

849
01:14:30,836 --> 01:14:33,555
I am Chao Min,
an unknown to the world of martial arts

850
01:14:33,756 --> 01:14:34,745
I have no importance

851
01:14:35,156 --> 01:14:38,466
- If you are afraid, leave this place
- Watch it.

852
01:14:43,756 --> 01:14:46,111
This is the woman from the restaurant

853
01:14:46,436 --> 01:14:49,314
Grandfather.
She is a Jinx-master

854
01:14:49,476 --> 01:14:51,592
This will be a heavy fight

855
01:14:53,316 --> 01:14:55,955
What a bunch of losers

856
01:14:56,156 --> 01:15:00,434
I never thought
you to be so strong

857
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,156
that you would beat the six schools

858
01:15:03,316 --> 01:15:05,591
and rule the Ming sect

859
01:15:05,796 --> 01:15:07,707
What a young hero

860
01:15:08,116 --> 01:15:12,985
Why did you buy all the herbs
and rented all the doctors?

861
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,506
I heard master Yan was wounded
by the shaolin

862
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:21,473
The poor doctors are often very bad,
so I arrested all the poor doctors

863
01:15:21,636 --> 01:15:27,347
But I have prepared
some 'Black Jade Past' for him

864
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:28,705
Master

865
01:15:30,316 --> 01:15:33,035
We are no friend of yours.
Why do you help us?

866
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:37,587
The Yuen-government wants heroes
to be friends with it

867
01:15:37,836 --> 01:15:40,509
You are the greatest kung-fu master in the world

868
01:15:40,716 --> 01:15:43,355
This gift is nothing

869
01:15:43,516 --> 01:15:45,711
Black Jade Paste is a very valuable
and potent medicine

870
01:15:46,076 --> 01:15:48,749
Why would she give it away like that

871
01:15:49,156 --> 01:15:51,067
You are manchurian

872
01:15:51,236 --> 01:15:52,555
Emperor Yu Yang is my father.

873
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:56,066
It is foolish of Shaolin to challenge you

874
01:15:56,236 --> 01:15:58,511
We will help you eradicate them

875
01:15:58,716 --> 01:16:01,184
Master, is that the Yee Tin sword?

876
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,353
Yes, it is

877
01:16:05,516 --> 01:16:07,472
We will solve it ourselves

878
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:11,515
We don't want no mingling of the Government,
thank you very much.

879
01:16:11,716 --> 01:16:17,348
Do stay, I have prepared a meal for you

880
01:16:17,716 --> 01:16:20,674
I will get changed first
may I be excused

881
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,344
We are leaving

882
01:16:23,516 --> 01:16:26,588
Do you know we're having Black Jade paste

883
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:30,749
Damn... How cocky can one get

884
01:16:33,196 --> 01:16:35,346
Is it true, or isn't it?

885
01:16:35,516 --> 01:16:37,154
It smells nice.

886
01:16:39,276 --> 01:16:41,346
A trap, get out of here

887
01:16:48,716 --> 01:16:49,546
What is wrong?

888
01:16:49,756 --> 01:16:54,147
We are so tired,
we have no strength anymore

889
01:16:54,316 --> 01:16:55,590
The poison

890
01:16:55,796 --> 01:16:58,754
All my brothers are poisoned by this

891
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,475
But I held my breath

892
01:17:00,836 --> 01:17:01,951
What do we have to do?

893
01:17:02,156 --> 01:17:05,671
I will get the antidote.
Look after them

894
01:17:27,316 --> 01:17:30,194
You are keeping your word

895
01:17:30,356 --> 01:17:32,745
and have a drink with me?

896
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,594
Why did you set a trap for us?

897
01:17:38,756 --> 01:17:41,668
Nobody asked you
to get the wooden sword

898
01:17:42,156 --> 01:17:44,351
One of you was greedy

899
01:17:44,516 --> 01:17:46,950
That's why they got poisoned

900
01:17:47,156 --> 01:17:50,307
- Give me the antidote
- Are you begging me?

901
01:17:50,476 --> 01:17:54,992
- Or are you forcing me?
- Where are those jinxes

902
01:17:55,196 --> 01:17:58,154
- Call them out
- Are you afraid of them?

903
01:17:58,476 --> 01:18:02,549
I will not tell you where they are.
So you will be scared.

904
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:05,316
Don't think I will not beat you
just because you are a woman

905
01:18:05,476 --> 01:18:09,071
I know, so I decided...

906
01:18:09,236 --> 01:18:10,555
...to attack first

907
01:18:16,116 --> 01:18:20,587
Yuen is so powerful and mighty...

908
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,550
...and has a very large territory.
You are just a man alone

909
01:18:23,756 --> 01:18:25,747
How do you intend to overthrow our government?

910
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:39,313
The Yuen people hate the totalitarian regime
I support these people

911
01:18:39,476 --> 01:18:41,671
We have armies of volunteers

912
01:18:41,876 --> 01:18:43,548
It is the will of the people

913
01:18:43,756 --> 01:18:46,475
Can you beat the will of the people?

914
01:19:09,796 --> 01:19:13,584
Master Chang, why not play a duet with me?

915
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:30,549
- Enough playing
- I love it

916
01:19:41,756 --> 01:19:44,589
Master Chang,
do you want to see my legs?

917
01:19:44,796 --> 01:19:47,310
Just tell me.
Why do you take my shoes?

918
01:19:47,476 --> 01:19:49,944
You are so cunning,
how dare you call yourself hero?

919
01:19:50,156 --> 01:19:53,353
I'm no hero.
I am a cunning woman

920
01:19:53,716 --> 01:19:57,948
- I tell you a secret. Women are cunning and devious
- I will not argue on that one

921
01:19:58,156 --> 01:20:01,193
If you don't give me the antidote,
I will burn the house to ashes

922
01:20:01,356 --> 01:20:04,666
I won't give a damn

923
01:20:05,196 --> 01:20:09,348
But your companions are seriously poisoned

924
01:20:09,516 --> 01:20:12,235
If they don't get the antidote
within 4 hours...

925
01:20:12,396 --> 01:20:17,231
...they will never regain their kung-fu.
Time is running out

926
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,749
Jinx-palm.

927
01:20:28,756 --> 01:20:32,271
- That was not the jinx palm
- I know, I don't know it

928
01:20:32,436 --> 01:20:34,427
I just wanted to scare you

929
01:20:35,636 --> 01:20:38,150
If I wouldn't have taken back half the energy

930
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:40,147
I would have killed you just like that

931
01:20:40,316 --> 01:20:43,672
You don't want to kill me.
You fancy me

932
01:20:43,876 --> 01:20:45,070
Bullshit

933
01:20:48,436 --> 01:20:50,586
Do you love your maid more?

934
01:20:50,796 --> 01:20:53,105
- Or me?
- I will kill you

935
01:20:54,156 --> 01:20:55,191
Go ahead

936
01:20:55,356 --> 01:20:59,144
Answer. If you don't,
I will not give you the antidote

937
01:21:01,076 --> 01:21:02,429
You love the maid more than me

938
01:21:02,796 --> 01:21:06,675
But I have sent sister No-mercy after her

939
01:21:06,876 --> 01:21:08,548
Devious bitch

940
01:21:08,756 --> 01:21:11,554
If you leave just like that...

941
01:21:11,756 --> 01:21:14,270
...your companions will never
re-gain their kung-fu.

942
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,585
I don't have a choice

943
01:21:27,436 --> 01:21:29,552
- Are you going to give it or not?
- No

944
01:21:29,756 --> 01:21:30,586
For the last time!

945
01:21:30,796 --> 01:21:32,991
Never, whatever happens

946
01:21:38,876 --> 01:21:40,104
Are you not afraid?

947
01:21:40,276 --> 01:21:41,789
Once I will be yours

948
01:21:42,156 --> 01:21:43,271
resistance is futile

949
01:21:43,436 --> 01:21:48,464
There is nobody anymore.
You can do with me as you please.

950
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:49,747
Shameless

951
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:55,149
Mo-kei, I could give you the antidote

952
01:21:55,316 --> 01:21:59,070
and the 'Black Jade Paste' as well.

953
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:00,590
But!

954
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,673
You have to promise me three things.

955
01:22:10,636 --> 01:22:14,345
Master, where are those Ming people?
They have disappeared

956
01:22:14,516 --> 01:22:15,710
Master, look

957
01:22:19,636 --> 01:22:22,548
There is sister No-mercy again...

958
01:22:22,756 --> 01:22:24,508
Siu Chiu, leave here

959
01:22:24,716 --> 01:22:26,672
The master wants me to stay

960
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:29,151
So I have to stay.

961
01:22:29,316 --> 01:22:31,955
You bastards,
what evil deeds are you planning?

962
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,351
Master, they seem to be poisoned

963
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:37,747
No step forward,
or I will suck your blood

964
01:22:40,796 --> 01:22:44,948
What is there to look at?
I drank too much blood, I spit it out.

965
01:22:45,156 --> 01:22:47,670
I once let you go.

966
01:22:47,876 --> 01:22:51,551
This is my chance to destroy
all evil in martial arts

967
01:22:51,756 --> 01:22:54,145
Master, it is not heroic to take
such an advantage

968
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:55,749
Fuck off, biatch

969
01:22:56,156 --> 01:23:01,071
If you can withstand three attacks of me,
you can kill me

970
01:23:01,236 --> 01:23:03,591
- How dare you?
- You can also have three goes

971
01:23:03,796 --> 01:23:05,593
If I lose,
then you can do whatever you want

972
01:23:05,836 --> 01:23:06,712
What a sharp tongue

973
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:09,584
If you survive three of my stances,
I will let you go

974
01:23:09,836 --> 01:23:10,985
Come on

975
01:23:12,796 --> 01:23:16,425
- Siu Chiu... Are you okay?
- Everything alright?

976
01:23:16,596 --> 01:23:17,665
I can stand it

977
01:23:23,556 --> 01:23:24,591
Two to go.

978
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:27,185
She is seriously hurt

979
01:23:27,356 --> 01:23:29,233
Let me finish her.

980
01:23:29,396 --> 01:23:32,547
I should not take my words back

981
01:23:32,756 --> 01:23:34,394
I wouldn't dare

982
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:56,672
Siu Chiu, leave us here.
Don't do it

983
01:24:00,516 --> 01:24:01,551
One more time

984
01:24:01,756 --> 01:24:04,395
If you want to die
you have the right person

985
01:24:13,396 --> 01:24:15,273
Master, are you alright?

986
01:24:19,316 --> 01:24:21,147
- Siu Chiu.
- Master.

987
01:24:23,156 --> 01:24:24,509
Go!

988
01:24:27,316 --> 01:24:29,591
Green Bat, give them the antidote

989
01:24:29,796 --> 01:24:32,435
Mo-kei, why did Chao Min give it to you?
Beware of traps

990
01:24:32,596 --> 01:24:35,747
I have had her eat three of them.
They are ok

991
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:38,305
Siu Chiu.

992
01:24:41,236 --> 01:24:42,669
Master.

993
01:24:42,876 --> 01:24:45,151
What a couple

994
01:24:45,516 --> 01:24:48,269
- How dare you come over here?
- Why not?

995
01:24:48,436 --> 01:24:52,793
Your master promised me three things.
That's why he got the antidote

996
01:24:54,476 --> 01:24:57,149
If they won't go against my conscience
and not against heroism

997
01:24:57,316 --> 01:25:00,752
I will not let you marry such a pretty girl,
Siu Chiu

998
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:05,112
That does not go against your conscience,
does it?

999
01:25:05,276 --> 01:25:07,551
Master Chang, not so easy

1000
01:25:07,756 --> 01:25:10,668
When I think of something else,
I will know where to find you

1001
01:25:12,796 --> 01:25:15,549
I have never seen
such a devious woman

1002
01:25:15,756 --> 01:25:19,465
This woman must be a great foe
of the Ming sect

1003
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:22,548
There must be something behind
the Shaolin attack on Wu-tong

1004
01:25:22,756 --> 01:25:24,986
We are going to the Shaolin temple
to get the truth

1005
01:25:29,316 --> 01:25:31,113
Are you alright, master?

1006
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:45,387
Master No-mercy, the emperor
Yu-yang would like you to be his guest.

1007
01:25:45,556 --> 01:25:46,750
After you

1008
01:25:52,076 --> 01:25:55,148
Why is it so quiet here?

1009
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,547
This is Chang Mo-kei,
together with King of White Eagle

1010
01:25:58,756 --> 01:26:01,554
and King of Green Bat
to visit your master.

1011
01:26:07,476 --> 01:26:10,354
Our master does not want to see anybody

1012
01:26:10,516 --> 01:26:14,668
We have come from far.
It is urgent.

1013
01:26:14,876 --> 01:26:16,355
Tell that to your master

1014
01:26:16,636 --> 01:26:19,594
He does not want to see you,
please go away.

1015
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:24,074
Wait, your movements are different
from the Shaolin kung fu

1016
01:26:24,396 --> 01:26:26,671
And your head has just been shaved

1017
01:26:26,876 --> 01:26:29,993
You are no real monk

1018
01:26:31,596 --> 01:26:33,951
Like I said, he is fake

1019
01:26:34,156 --> 01:26:36,386
- Let's get him
- Right

1020
01:26:44,716 --> 01:26:46,547
Look, master

1021
01:26:46,756 --> 01:26:49,190
'First kill Shaolin, then Wu-tong'

1022
01:26:49,356 --> 01:26:50,584
'We, the Ming sect are the most powerful'

1023
01:26:50,796 --> 01:26:52,673
It is a trap.

1024
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:55,231
Have all the kung-fu masters
of Shaolin been killed?

1025
01:26:55,396 --> 01:26:58,069
Maybe poisoned with the 'Odour'

1026
01:26:58,236 --> 01:27:01,353
They will surely have been taken away

1027
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:02,710
- Goddamn.
- What is it?

1028
01:27:03,116 --> 01:27:05,949
'Kill Shaolin and Wu-tong'
They are probably going to Wu-tong now.

1029
01:27:06,156 --> 01:27:07,714
Let's hurry there

1030
01:27:08,116 --> 01:27:09,674
You wanted to leave just like that?

1031
01:27:13,516 --> 01:27:14,665
Master, you better leave first.

1032
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:20,265
What is the matter?

1033
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:23,155
Hung Shang of the Shaolin
wants to speak to master Chang

1034
01:27:28,716 --> 01:27:30,752
Master, a great disaster
has come over Shaolin

1035
01:27:31,156 --> 01:27:33,545
The Evil Cult has struck.
Everyone except me has died.

1036
01:27:33,756 --> 01:27:34,666
For real?

1037
01:27:34,836 --> 01:27:36,986
The evil ones have captured
all the masters who raided Bright Summit

1038
01:27:37,316 --> 01:27:39,546
If you don't do anything, the Evil Cult
will control the world of martial arts

1039
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:41,269
Rise

1040
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,035
Take care, master

1041
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:53,147
This monk is fake, he is from the Evil Sect

1042
01:27:53,316 --> 01:27:54,547
Where is your father and uncles?

1043
01:27:56,756 --> 01:27:59,589
Mo-kei is not dead.
He joined the Evil Cult

1044
01:27:59,796 --> 01:28:03,584
He learned a lot of evil magic.
My father and four uncles were not prepared

1045
01:28:03,836 --> 01:28:05,508
They were assassinated by him

1046
01:28:05,716 --> 01:28:08,355
All five of them

1047
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:11,189
Ching-su, what has happened?

1048
01:28:13,756 --> 01:28:15,155
Master...

1049
01:28:18,636 --> 01:28:21,150
How dare you try to kill me?

1050
01:28:23,796 --> 01:28:27,345
Even a scapegoat could not fool you

1051
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:30,588
Master you should be a man of the world

1052
01:28:30,796 --> 01:28:34,311
You are good in kung-fu.
You shouldn't be a Taoist monk over here.

1053
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:37,468
Why not follow me,
and work for the government?

1054
01:28:37,836 --> 01:28:40,748
We will become rich together

1055
01:28:58,596 --> 01:29:01,394
Chang San-fung, you still remember us?

1056
01:29:01,556 --> 01:29:04,275
So all the problems all these years

1057
01:29:04,436 --> 01:29:08,145
- were the work of the government
- Yes, you are right

1058
01:29:08,316 --> 01:29:12,025
His majesty wants you to be his
head of the government

1059
01:29:12,356 --> 01:29:16,235
If you are willing to work for us,
your school will be prosperous.

1060
01:29:16,396 --> 01:29:19,069
And your students
will become generals in the army

1061
01:29:19,236 --> 01:29:21,545
to settle the riots for the government

1062
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:24,475
I, Chang San-fung,
will do what seems right to me

1063
01:29:24,836 --> 01:29:26,110
I will not betray on the clans.

1064
01:29:26,276 --> 01:29:28,585
If you are not going to work for us,

1065
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:31,185
you will go straight to hell

1066
01:29:32,276 --> 01:29:34,790
No panic, I am scratching my back.

1067
01:29:51,196 --> 01:29:54,506
Chang, how much blood have you got?

1068
01:29:54,716 --> 01:29:56,195
Protect the master

1069
01:30:04,236 --> 01:30:05,749
Stop, I will deal with this myself

1070
01:30:11,316 --> 01:30:12,669
Magic Stance

1071
01:30:20,556 --> 01:30:23,309
- Master
- Everything alright?

1072
01:30:23,476 --> 01:30:26,274
- Mo-kei.
- How are you?

1073
01:30:26,436 --> 01:30:28,270
Ching-su, that bastard,
tried to assassinate me

1074
01:31:04,156 --> 01:31:06,716
How did you get so powerful?

1075
01:31:07,116 --> 01:31:10,472
You asked me to keep my virginity
and I kept my word

1076
01:31:10,636 --> 01:31:13,753
Every morning it points straight up.

1077
01:31:15,476 --> 01:31:18,513
No woman wants me.
Therefore I am still a virgin

1078
01:31:18,716 --> 01:31:21,549
You have plenty of opportunities.
Better use them

1079
01:31:21,756 --> 01:31:23,075
Cut the crap

1080
01:31:39,796 --> 01:31:41,354
Your Highness

1081
01:31:45,196 --> 01:31:48,347
How can you be that impolite
to master Chang?

1082
01:31:48,516 --> 01:31:50,984
How are you, master Chang?
I am Chao Min.

1083
01:31:53,756 --> 01:31:55,587
Your Highness

1084
01:31:55,796 --> 01:31:58,708
Master Chang, don't be so stubborn

1085
01:31:59,116 --> 01:32:01,676
Do you want your students to be killed?

1086
01:32:01,836 --> 01:32:06,990
Men should die once.
But we should go meaningfully

1087
01:32:07,196 --> 01:32:09,107
Master, don't panic, I am with you

1088
01:32:11,156 --> 01:32:16,025
Master Chang, do you remember,
you promised me three things

1089
01:32:16,196 --> 01:32:17,265
Are you going to keep that promise?

1090
01:32:17,596 --> 01:32:21,555
If they don't go against my conscience
and heroism, I will do it

1091
01:32:21,756 --> 01:32:24,987
First: You can not use Solar Stance again

1092
01:32:25,316 --> 01:32:28,547
Do you want him to be chained up?

1093
01:32:28,756 --> 01:32:34,672
What a sharp mouth.
I will silence it soon enough

1094
01:32:34,836 --> 01:32:37,714
Second: No more Magic Stance

1095
01:32:38,076 --> 01:32:40,351
Alright, I promise

1096
01:32:40,716 --> 01:32:42,308
Which kung-fu are you going to use then?

1097
01:32:42,636 --> 01:32:45,594
Teach me any.
Why not the kung-fu of Wu-tong?

1098
01:32:45,836 --> 01:32:47,394
- Is it any good?
- Of course

1099
01:32:47,556 --> 01:32:48,750
Master, Let's do it

1100
01:33:10,156 --> 01:33:14,547
Tai-chi grows from nothing.

1101
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,271
Master, I cannot make it, quickly

1102
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:25,751
Come on, children,
I will teach you Tai-chi

1103
01:33:29,316 --> 01:33:32,228
The origin of the motion.
The origin of everything.

1104
01:33:32,516 --> 01:33:35,474
Positive and negative are bound together.
Can not be separated

1105
01:33:35,636 --> 01:33:38,469
Two elements that support each other

1106
01:33:38,636 --> 01:33:40,354
Stay calm

1107
01:33:40,516 --> 01:33:42,154
Think about your respiration

1108
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:45,228
Concentrate your mind, focus your attention

1109
01:33:45,396 --> 01:33:48,991
Turn soft to hard.
Use both soft and hard.

1110
01:33:49,196 --> 01:33:54,111
In Tai-chi there is both soft and hard.
Use them both

1111
01:33:54,276 --> 01:33:56,551
Generate as much force as you need.

1112
01:34:09,476 --> 01:34:12,070
Mo-kei, you already got Solar Stance

1113
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:14,670
You can learn any other kung-fu very fast

1114
01:34:14,876 --> 01:34:19,506
Tai-chi is about intention,
not the stance

1115
01:34:19,716 --> 01:34:21,547
Forget all your stances

1116
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:24,395
Only then you can be victorious

1117
01:34:33,196 --> 01:34:35,949
- Do you still remember?
- I forgot

1118
01:34:36,156 --> 01:34:37,748
- What is their name?
- Don't remember

1119
01:34:38,116 --> 01:34:39,515
- What is your father's name?
- Don't remember

1120
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:42,992
Good... But one thing.
Show no mercy

1121
01:36:13,396 --> 01:36:15,546
Congratulations, you have a very good student

1122
01:36:15,756 --> 01:36:18,554
And you a very good grandson.

1123
01:36:18,756 --> 01:36:22,351
I will let you go now, the last promise

1124
01:36:22,516 --> 01:36:26,191
Chang Mo-kei, I will not let you
repay me that easily

1125
01:36:26,356 --> 01:36:28,551
I have got the life
of the six schools in my hands

1126
01:36:28,756 --> 01:36:32,669
If I don't go back,
they will be killed in three days

1127
01:36:32,836 --> 01:36:34,155
What do you want?

1128
01:36:34,316 --> 01:36:37,069
You are lucky today, come with me

1129
01:36:37,236 --> 01:36:39,670
Not that easy

1130
01:36:40,076 --> 01:36:44,592
Ok, then not.
I will stay another ten days

1131
01:36:44,796 --> 01:36:47,549
- You'd better prepare for the funerals of your friends
- You can go

1132
01:36:47,756 --> 01:36:49,235
But Ching-su stays here.

1133
01:36:49,396 --> 01:36:52,194
Don't leave me here, your Highness

1134
01:36:52,356 --> 01:36:58,670
Such a heartless dog.
It is useless for me to keep

1135
01:36:59,076 --> 01:37:00,270
You can have him

1136
01:37:03,396 --> 01:37:05,990
Master, I deserve to die.
I am useless

1137
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:09,313
Master, please let me go

1138
01:37:09,476 --> 01:37:12,548
How can you face your father like that

1139
01:37:12,756 --> 01:37:18,114
Mo-kei, we've grown up together.
Please beg master to let me go

1140
01:37:18,276 --> 01:37:20,312
Uncle Sung has only one son

1141
01:37:20,476 --> 01:37:24,435
If I kill you,
he will not have any descendent

1142
01:37:24,596 --> 01:37:25,995
Alright

1143
01:37:29,236 --> 01:37:31,272
Master,
I have finished all his kung-fu

1144
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:34,588
- Let him live
- Alright

1145
01:37:34,836 --> 01:37:35,985
Thank you, master

1146
01:37:40,596 --> 01:37:44,066
Chang Mo-kei,
you still owe me one more thing

1147
01:37:44,236 --> 01:37:48,149
If you want to save the six schools,
come and visit me in the Capital.
