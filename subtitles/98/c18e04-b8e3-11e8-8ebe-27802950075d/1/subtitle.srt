1
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:14,976
Dick Laurent is dead.

2
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:05,425
You don't mind that
I'm not coming tonight?

3
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,220
What are you going to do?

4
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,516
Stay home, read.

5
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,022
Read?

6
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,326
Read?

7
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,206
Read what, Renee?

8
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,300
It's nice to know
I can still make you laugh.

9
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:48,552
I like to laugh, Fred.

10
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:57,145
That's why I married you.

11
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,988
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

12
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:47,637
What is that?

13
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,187
A videotape.

14
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:01,609
I found it outside on the steps.

15
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,032
Who's it from?

16
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,535
I don't know.

17
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:13,872
There isn't anything on the envelope.

18
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:19,879
Does it say anything on the tape?

19
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,095
No. Nothing.

20
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,684
Well, see what's on it.

21
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,244
Come on.

22
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:32,705
Must be from a real estate agent.

23
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,042
Maybe.

24
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,765
It's OK.

25
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:10,559
It's OK.

26
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,312
It's OK.

27
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,367
I had a dream last night.

28
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,457
You were inside the house...

29
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,927
You were calling my name...

30
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:29,433
Fred!

31
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:35,773
Fred!

32
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:39,402
Where are you.

33
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,660
I couldn't find you.

34
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,723
Then there you were...

35
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:10,560
...lying in bed.

36
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,520
It wasn't you.

37
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:18,151
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

38
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,095
Fred, are you all right?

39
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:53,126
You're up early.

40
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,171
That dog woke me.

41
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:09,810
Who the hell owns that dog?

42
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,698
What's that?

43
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:29,748
Another videotape.

44
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:31,666
Yes.

45
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,015
Don't you want to watch it?

46
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,935
I guess so.

47
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,830
Well, don't you want to watch it?

48
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:10,873
Yeah.

49
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:24,471
It's the same thing.

50
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:31,645
No, it isn't.

51
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:41,113
Fred?

52
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,172
What?

53
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,646
We have to call the police.

54
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:13,774
That's right. Yes.

55
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:25,284
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

56
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,997
7035 Hollis.

57
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,044
Near the observatory.

58
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:36,505
Yes.

59
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:40,050
We'll be here.

60
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,140
So?

61
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:49,644
They're sending 2 detectives out.

62
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:07,413
That's it.

63
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:09,747
What do you think.

64
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:12,543
I really don't know.

65
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:24,639
Let's check the hallway
and the bedroom.

66
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:49,540
This is the bedroom?

67
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,045
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

68
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,467
This is our bedroom.

69
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:04,472
There's no other bedroom?

70
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,600
No.

71
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:14,232
I mean,
I use it as a practice room.

72
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,610
It's soundproof.

73
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:18,278
You're a musician?

74
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,530
Yeah.

75
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:22,742
What's your axe?

76
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,494
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

77
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,874
- Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

78
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,002
Do you own a video camera?

79
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:33,878
No.

80
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,715
Fred hates them.

81
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:47,892
I like to remember things my own way.

82
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:50,603
What do you mean by that?

83
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:57,987
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

84
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,159
You have an alarm system?

85
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,038
Yes. Actually, we do.

86
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:10,458
But we haven't been using it lately.

87
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:12,627
Why not?

88
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:17,882
It kept going off...

89
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:22,595
For some reason. False alarms.

90
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,349
Might want to try and use it again.

91
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,393
Yeah.

92
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,398
OK?

93
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,488
We're going to check the windows and doors,
see if anybody tried to break in.

94
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:57,320
- We'll keep watch over the house.
- We'll do the best we can.

95
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:02,659
- If anything else happens, you'll call us.
- We will.

96
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:07,873
- Thanks, guys.
- It's what we do.

97
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:46,705
Hey, Andy! Welcome to my party.

98
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:50,000
- You look ravishing.
- Thank you.

99
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,434
Fred!

100
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:08,603
Please!

101
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,898
Please!

102
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,193
Hey!

103
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,839
- 2 double scotches, neat.
- OK.

104
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:29,021
We've met before, haven't we?

105
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:34,192
I don't think so.

106
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,532
Where was it you think we met?

107
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:43,452
At your house. Don't you remember?

108
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,750
No. No, I don't.

109
00:29:50,126 --> 00:29:51,544
Are you sure?

110
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:53,921
Of course.

111
00:29:55,423 --> 00:29:59,720
As a matter of fact,
I'm there right now.

112
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,145
What do you mean?
You're where right now?

113
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:12,483
At your house.

114
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:18,573
That's fucking crazy, man!

115
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:29,000
Call me!

116
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:36,926
Dial your number!

117
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:42,223
Go ahead!

118
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,321
I told you I was here.

119
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,368
How'd you do that?

120
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:07,665
Ask me!

121
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,507
How'd you get inside my house?

122
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:21,556
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

123
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:23,765
Who are you?

124
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:25,935
Hm.

125
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:33,818
Give me back my phone.

126
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:48,167
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

127
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,314
- I thought you were getting me a drink.
- Hang on just a minute.

128
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:15,070
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

129
00:32:16,446 --> 00:32:19,699
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

130
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:26,332
Dick Laurent?

131
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,543
Yeah. I believe so.

132
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,968
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

133
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:41,931
He is?

134
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:47,395
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

135
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,317
I don't.

136
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,113
I don't know him.

137
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:57,824
Dick can't be dead.

138
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,617
Who told you he was dead?

139
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:04,706
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

140
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,917
Let's go home.

141
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:11,421
- But...
- Now. We're leaving now.

142
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,718
We never should have come here
in the first place.

143
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:27,187
So, how'd you meet
that asshole Andy anyway?

144
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:33,068
It was a long time ago.

145
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,948
We met at a place called Moke's.

146
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:41,493
We became friends.

147
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:44,204
He told me about a job.

148
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:46,416
What job?

149
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,338
I don't remember.

150
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,426
Anyway... Andy's OK.

151
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:02,557
Well, he's got some pretty
fucked-up friends.

152
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:14,070
Hey!...
Hey!...

153
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:17,073
Stay in the car.

154
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,835
I told you to stay in the car.

155
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:51,380
Why? What is it?

156
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:54,967
Why did you make me stay out here?

157
00:35:57,595 --> 00:36:01,265
I'll tell you why, because I
thought someone was inside the house.

158
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:06,647
Was there?

159
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:10,484
No, of course not.

160
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:57,282
Fred?

161
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,711
Fred, where are you?

162
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,686
Renee!

163
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,857
Renee!

164
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:09,568
Sit down, Killer!

165
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:16,116
I didn't kill her.

166
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,288
Tell me I didn't kill her.

167
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:39,432
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

168
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,568
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

169
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,490
it is my order that you be put
to death in the electric chair.

170
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,300
Make yourself to home, fella.

171
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,185
Stick your hand out, chief.

172
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,078
Something wrong?

173
00:45:43,584 --> 00:45:45,169
It's... my head.

174
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:12,656
You sleeping OK?

175
00:46:13,657 --> 00:46:14,324
No.

176
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:18,329
I can't sleep.

177
00:47:07,964 --> 00:47:09,590
You'll sleep now.

178
00:47:11,218 --> 00:47:13,512
Take him back to his cell.

179
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,264
Let's go.

180
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:29,154
Guard!

181
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:34,284
Guard!

182
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:47,756
Guard!

183
00:47:53,762 --> 00:47:54,346
Hey!

184
00:47:58,016 --> 00:47:59,184
What do you want?

185
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:03,856
Aspirin.
My head.

186
00:48:06,525 --> 00:48:08,319
Hey! Hey!

187
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,379
Shit. That wife killer's
looking pretty fucked up.

188
00:48:26,046 --> 00:48:27,631
Which one?

189
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:15,952
Pete!

190
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:18,413
Please don't go!

191
00:50:19,956 --> 00:50:20,624
No. Pete!

192
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:23,002
Pete!..Pete!..Pete!
Wait a minute!

193
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,431
Fuck me!

194
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,692
All right. What's the situation?

195
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:08,987
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

196
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:26,089
Right here.

197
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,389
That's not Fred Madison.

198
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:37,434
No, Sir. It's not.

199
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,608
- Who is it?
- I couldn't say, Sir.

200
00:52:46,778 --> 00:52:48,028
Captain Luneau?

201
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,863
Yeah, Mike?

202
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:51,616
Captain...

203
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:54,868
This is some spooky shit we got here.

204
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:07,591
Well, Gentlemen,
we know who the stranger is.

205
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:12,263
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

206
00:53:13,013 --> 00:53:16,350
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft

207
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:19,770
for which he was put
on probation for 1 year.

208
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:27,821
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

209
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:20,542
So...

210
00:55:02,294 --> 00:55:04,588
- Here.
- Thanks, Lou.

211
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,208
Where the fuck have you been, man?

212
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:01,461
- Hey! -Hiya. -Hi.
- Hey, guy.

213
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:05,257
- Hey, man.
- What's up man?

214
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:08,552
Well, you look like shit.

215
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,262
Yeah. What happened?

216
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:13,974
Just haven't been feeling so good.

217
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:16,143
You're not contagious, are you?

218
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,937
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

219
00:57:18,145 --> 00:57:20,106
All right.
Well, let's go for a drive then.

220
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:23,067
Different kinds of fruits
grow and ripen.

221
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:26,612
It takes many strawberries
to fill a bucket.

222
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:29,742
But it's worth it
when you know that...

223
00:57:30,034 --> 00:57:31,409
- Come on.
- Hoh.

224
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:33,202
Come on. I'll lead.

225
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:37,041
...and a glass of fresh,
cold milk from grandmother's cow.

226
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,294
See ya later.

227
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:44,923
- I'm gonna go out
  with these clowns for a while.
- That should do you some good.

228
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,763
- Good night. -See ya.
- Good night.

229
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,544
What's happening to you?

230
00:58:23,296 --> 00:58:25,174
What happened to your face?

231
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:29,762
- I don't know?
- What do you mean, you don't know?

232
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,308
You've been acting strange lately.

233
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:35,226
Like the other night.

234
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:39,022
What night?

235
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:41,983
The last time I saw you.

236
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:44,360
I don't remember.

237
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,542
You still care about me?

238
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:24,819
Pete!

239
00:59:27,823 --> 00:59:29,699
- Arnie!
- Where you been?

240
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,494
- How you doing?
- It's good you're back...

241
00:59:32,745 --> 00:59:35,497
...Wonderful.
- Good to see you, man.

242
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:36,373
Listen, man, a lot of people...

243
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:39,960
...gonna be real happy
that you're back, including me.

244
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,795
Well, it's good to be back.

245
00:59:42,005 --> 00:59:44,132
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

246
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:45,675
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

247
00:59:45,884 --> 00:59:48,510
And Mr. Eddy called.

248
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,931
- Can I call him and tell him to come in?
- Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

249
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,561
- And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
- You're ready to work?
- Yeah.

250
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:59,147
- Well, let's go to work.
- All right, Buddy.

251
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:04,361
Petey's back!

252
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:23,882
There's 9 People down here.

253
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,638
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

254
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:32,766
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

255
01:00:42,317 --> 01:00:43,735
Hey, Pete!

256
01:00:47,072 --> 01:00:48,073
Pete!

257
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:52,036
Where's Pete?

258
01:00:53,413 --> 01:00:54,747
He's back there!

259
01:00:54,956 --> 01:00:55,790
Mr. Eddy!

260
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:58,668
Hey!

261
01:01:02,714 --> 01:01:04,173
What happened?

262
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,592
- Somebody giving you trouble?
- No. No trouble.

263
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:10,556
'Cause if somebody's
giving you trouble, Pete,...

264
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,559
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that!

265
01:01:13,767 --> 01:01:18,147
- No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
- I mean it, Pete. Like... that!

266
01:01:18,397 --> 01:01:20,774
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

267
01:01:20,983 --> 01:01:24,820
- ...just a regular tune-up?
- I want you to take a ride with me.

268
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:27,656
I don't like the sound of something.

269
01:01:27,866 --> 01:01:31,952
- OK. I got to check in with the boss.
- It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

270
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,493
Pull it over, but keep it running.

271
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:33,393
Best goddamn ears in town.

272
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:49,952
Give that a try.

273
01:02:56,208 --> 01:03:01,338
Beautiful...
Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.

274
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:07,303
- Let's take a ride.
- Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

275
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:23,194
It's a beautiful day.

276
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:32,495
- You did a great job, Pete.
- Yeah.

277
01:03:33,873 --> 01:03:36,584
Well, you know I like
working on this car, Mr. Eddy.

278
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:57,563
Shit. That cocksucker
doing what I think he's doing?

279
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:30,598
This is where mechanical excellence...

280
01:04:30,808 --> 01:04:34,477
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

281
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:11,851
Ahh... Oh, oh, God!

282
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:21,610
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!

283
01:05:22,111 --> 01:05:23,988
- Ever!
- Tell him you won't tailgate.

284
01:05:24,196 --> 01:05:25,030
Ever!

285
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:28,701
- I won't ever...
- Do you know how many
  fucking car lengths it takes...

286
01:05:28,952 --> 01:05:32,121
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?!

287
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,834
6 fucking car lengths!
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister!

288
01:05:36,793 --> 01:05:39,421
If I had to stop suddenly,
you would've hit me!

289
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:44,175
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual!
I want you to study that motherfucker!

290
01:05:44,426 --> 01:05:46,720
And I want you
to obey the goddamn rules!

291
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:50,849
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

292
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:53,977
Because of fucking assholes like you!

293
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:00,610
- Tell me you're going to get a manual!
- I will ge-get a manual.

294
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:05,031
Fucking Idiot!

295
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:08,367
Oh! Aah! Oh, Gooood!

296
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,578
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

297
01:06:50,412 --> 01:06:54,249
But tailgating
is one thing I cannot tolerate.

298
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,669
Yeah, I can see that.

299
01:07:08,514 --> 01:07:09,432
Wait a minute!

300
01:07:14,895 --> 01:07:17,274
- Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
- No, thank you.

301
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:19,860
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

302
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:23,655
You like pornos?

303
01:07:23,864 --> 01:07:26,323
- Pornos?
- Give you a boner?

304
01:07:27,492 --> 01:07:30,287
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

305
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,414
Suit yourself, champ.

306
01:07:33,665 --> 01:07:37,669
- Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
- You will.

307
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:45,762
Damn!

308
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,857
Lou, you recognize that guy?

309
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:01,612
Yeah... Laurent.

310
01:09:12,894 --> 01:09:16,732
- What do you want?
- Want to go for a drive?

311
01:09:18,525 --> 01:09:19,860
I don't know.

312
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:23,321
Get in, Baby!

313
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:46,305
Come here!

314
01:10:29,432 --> 01:10:33,104
- Why don't you like me?
- I do like you.

315
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,106
How much?

316
01:11:44,511 --> 01:11:45,888
Oh, Pete!

317
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,021
Sheila!

318
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:57,150
Sheila!

319
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:41,738
What'd you change it for?

320
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:43,949
I like that.

321
01:12:45,283 --> 01:12:46,618
Well, I don't.

322
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:58,005
I like that!

323
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,129
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

324
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,132
- Think you'll get a chance
  to give her the once-over today?
- Sure.

325
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:42,761
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

326
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,890
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

327
01:13:47,182 --> 01:13:50,852
- It'll be done.
- You're my man, Pete.

328
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:42,136
Don't let that thing upset you.

329
01:16:08,705 --> 01:16:11,709
Holy smokes!

330
01:16:38,444 --> 01:16:39,530
Hey!

331
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:43,492
I'm Alice Wakefield.

332
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:45,743
Pete Dayton.

333
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:51,166
- I was here earlier.
- Yeah, I remember.

334
01:16:58,341 --> 01:17:00,635
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

335
01:17:02,595 --> 01:17:04,388
I don't know.

336
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:11,521
OK.

337
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:15,276
Why don't I take you to dinner?

338
01:17:18,027 --> 01:17:22,116
Look, I don't think
this is a very good idea.

339
01:17:29,749 --> 01:17:31,250
Do you have a phone?

340
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,421
Yeah.

341
01:17:36,464 --> 01:17:38,591
It's right... It's right there.

342
01:17:39,467 --> 01:17:42,220
I have to call myself another taxi.

343
01:17:52,814 --> 01:17:54,775
Hello? Van Nuys?

344
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:59,070
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

345
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:16,798
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

346
01:18:17,674 --> 01:18:21,177
Hello. Yeah, we're not going to need that cab.
Thanks.

347
01:18:37,904 --> 01:18:40,907
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

348
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,944
Take my clothes off!

349
01:19:20,197 --> 01:19:23,159
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

350
01:20:14,171 --> 01:20:17,174
- I want more.
- Me, too.

351
01:20:22,096 --> 01:20:27,936
- Can I call you?
- Yeah. Call me at home.
  I'll give you the number.

352
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,401
OK, Baby.

353
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:09,146
Hey! Up here.Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

354
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:46,727
I'll get it.
Hello?

355
01:21:47,643 --> 01:21:50,813
Meow, meow.It's me.

356
01:21:51,063 --> 01:21:52,566
Hey, Baby.

357
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,820
I can't see you tonight.

358
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:01,450
OK.

359
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,454
I have to go somewhere
with Mr. Eddy.

360
01:22:06,664 --> 01:22:08,040
Sure.

361
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:15,256
I think he suspects something.
We have to be careful.

362
01:22:18,343 --> 01:22:19,969
I miss you.

363
01:22:23,891 --> 01:22:24,808
Pete?

364
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,685
Me, too.

365
01:22:29,562 --> 01:22:31,607
I'll call you again.

366
01:24:10,168 --> 01:24:11,796
What a fucking job.

367
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,340
His or ours, Lou?

368
01:24:16,382 --> 01:24:17,468
Ours, Hank.

369
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:45,580
- Hey.
- Sit down a minute!

370
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,209
- What's up?
- Sit down!

371
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:53,588
You don't look so good.

372
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:57,467
No, I just... just have a headache.

373
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:00,513
What's going on?

374
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,015
The police called us.

375
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:07,186
What'd they want?

376
01:25:07,437 --> 01:25:13,026
They want to know
if we had a chance to find out
what happened to you the other night.

377
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:16,905
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

378
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:23,287
But I don't remember anything.

379
01:25:24,955 --> 01:25:27,249
What'd you tell them?

380
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:35,090
We're not going to say anything...

381
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:37,926
...about that night to the police.

382
01:25:40,889 --> 01:25:43,266
We saw you that night, Pete.

383
01:25:46,728 --> 01:25:49,105
You came home with your friend Sheila.

384
01:25:51,358 --> 01:25:52,108
Sheila?

385
01:25:55,528 --> 01:25:58,073
Yeah. There was a man with you.

386
01:25:59,115 --> 01:26:02,953
What is this? I mean,
why didn't you tell me anything?

387
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,752
Who's the man?

388
01:26:11,378 --> 01:26:14,715
I've never seen him before in my life.

389
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,890
What happened to me?

390
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:28,146
Please, please, Dad, Tell me!

391
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:48,167
Hey, Pete! Hey!

392
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:50,670
Hey!

393
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:03,141
Hey!

394
01:27:04,351 --> 01:27:05,185
Mr. Eddy.

395
01:27:15,988 --> 01:27:18,115
Hey, Pete!

396
01:27:19,032 --> 01:27:21,076
- How you doing?
- I'm OK.

397
01:27:21,286 --> 01:27:24,289
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

398
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:27,709
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

399
01:27:28,667 --> 01:27:33,465
Her name is Alice.I swear,
I love that girl to death.

400
01:27:36,093 --> 01:27:40,389
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

401
01:27:42,808 --> 01:27:44,685
I'd take this

402
01:27:44,935 --> 01:27:49,106
and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

403
01:27:49,314 --> 01:27:52,735
- And then you know what I'd do?
- What?

404
01:27:53,612 --> 01:27:56,447
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

405
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:07,626
Hey. You're looking good.

406
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:10,544
What you been up to?

407
01:28:20,388 --> 01:28:21,473
I'll get it.

408
01:28:23,642 --> 01:28:24,310
Hello?

409
01:28:26,562 --> 01:28:33,068
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

410
01:28:38,616 --> 01:28:39,785
He'll kill us.

411
01:28:43,704 --> 01:28:45,123
Are you...

412
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:49,418
...positive that he knows?

413
01:28:49,628 --> 01:28:52,631
I'm not positive, but he knows.

414
01:28:55,217 --> 01:29:01,056
So... What are we supposed to do?

415
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:05,644
I don't know.

416
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:42,058
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

417
01:29:46,646 --> 01:29:48,356
I know a guy.

418
01:29:50,901 --> 01:29:54,154
He pays girls to party with him.

419
01:29:54,862 --> 01:29:56,656
He's always got a lot of cash.

420
01:29:58,241 --> 01:30:00,118
He'd be easy to rob.

421
01:30:01,661 --> 01:30:06,292
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

422
01:30:08,294 --> 01:30:10,588
We could be together.

423
01:30:19,138 --> 01:30:20,932
Have you partied with him?

424
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,898
Did you like it?

425
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:32,110
No.

426
01:30:33,111 --> 01:30:34,530
It was part of the deal.

427
01:30:35,823 --> 01:30:36,907
What deal?

428
01:30:41,203 --> 01:30:43,748
- He works for Mr. Eddy.
- Yeah?

429
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:47,709
- And what's he do?
- He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

430
01:30:48,544 --> 01:30:51,881
- Pornos?
- Yeah.

431
01:30:53,007 --> 01:30:55,551
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

432
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,597
- Pete...
- No. Pete. I want to know
  how it happened.

433
01:31:04,352 --> 01:31:06,479
It was a long time ago.

434
01:31:08,231 --> 01:31:12,444
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

435
01:31:14,113 --> 01:31:16,157
He told me about a job.

436
01:31:21,537 --> 01:31:22,872
In pornos?

437
01:31:26,084 --> 01:31:31,297
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

438
01:31:34,342 --> 01:31:38,012
He made an appointment
for me to see a man.

439
01:31:39,097 --> 01:31:40,682
I went to this place.

440
01:31:43,351 --> 01:31:45,228
They made me wait there forever.

441
01:31:47,732 --> 01:31:50,108
There was a guy guarding the door.

442
01:31:54,614 --> 01:31:57,492
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

443
01:32:04,707 --> 01:32:06,584
I started getting nervous.

444
01:32:09,003 --> 01:32:11,464
When it got dark...

445
01:32:12,632 --> 01:32:15,885
...they brought me
into this other room.

446
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:42,456
Why didn't you just leave?

447
01:34:50,714 --> 01:34:52,925
You liked it, huh?

448
01:34:56,555 --> 01:35:02,018
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

449
01:35:07,566 --> 01:35:09,776
I don't want you to go away.

450
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,070
I don't want you to go away.

451
01:35:22,831 --> 01:35:24,792
I love you, Alice.

452
01:35:29,005 --> 01:35:31,549
- Should I call Andy?
- Andy?

453
01:35:33,468 --> 01:35:36,471
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

454
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:40,224
Yeah. Call him.

455
01:35:43,102 --> 01:35:45,314
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

456
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:48,358
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

457
01:35:48,775 --> 01:35:53,572
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

458
01:35:54,281 --> 01:36:00,454
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

459
01:36:00,663 --> 01:36:03,666
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

460
01:36:03,917 --> 01:36:08,713
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

461
01:36:09,088 --> 01:36:12,842
Go through the kitchen into the
living room. There's a bar there.

462
01:36:13,177 --> 01:36:17,473
At 11:15, I'll send Andy down
to fix me a drink.

463
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:21,434
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

464
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:26,105
OK.

465
01:36:56,263 --> 01:36:58,974
- You're fucking somebody else,
  aren't you?
- Sheila!

466
01:36:59,182 --> 01:37:01,560
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila! Sheila, stop it!

467
01:37:01,769 --> 01:37:03,979
- You don't call. Who is she?
- Stop it!

468
01:37:04,188 --> 01:37:07,149
- What's the bitch's name?
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?

469
01:37:07,358 --> 01:37:08,985
- Go home!
- You're sorry?
- Sheila, stop it!

470
01:37:09,235 --> 01:37:11,279
You're sorry, you piece of shit!

471
01:37:11,487 --> 01:37:12,947
- You're sorry?
- Go home!

472
01:37:13,156 --> 01:37:15,283
- Fuck you!..Fuck you!
- Sheila, stop, Sheila!
- Fuck you! ...Fuck you!

473
01:37:15,575 --> 01:37:18,119
- Fuck you!..Fuck you!
- Sheila... Sheila.

474
01:37:18,453 --> 01:37:22,665
Sheila! Let's both go in
and talk about this quietly.

475
01:37:23,082 --> 01:37:24,667
Sheila, come on.

476
01:37:27,129 --> 01:37:29,423
- You are different.
- Sheila!

477
01:37:29,756 --> 01:37:32,050
Tell him!..Tell him!

478
01:37:32,259 --> 01:37:35,095
Sheila, don't. Don't.

479
01:37:36,555 --> 01:37:43,521
I don't care anymore anyway.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

480
01:37:44,105 --> 01:37:50,194
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

481
01:38:04,876 --> 01:38:05,960
Pete?

482
01:38:09,005 --> 01:38:10,633
There's a man on the phone.

483
01:38:11,926 --> 01:38:14,470
He's called
a couple of times tonight.

484
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:16,263
Who is it?

485
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:20,018
He won't give his name.

486
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,413
Hello?

487
01:38:41,164 --> 01:38:43,708
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

488
01:38:46,044 --> 01:38:50,341
- Who is this?
- You know who it is.

489
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,221
Mr. Eddy?

490
01:38:56,179 --> 01:38:59,184
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

491
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:03,897
- OK.
- You're doing OK?
  That's good, Pete.

492
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:12,239
- Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
- I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

493
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:20,455
- You're sure you're OK?
  Everything all right?
- Yeah.

494
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:25,919
I'm really glad to know
you're doing good, Pete. Hey!

495
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:29,007
I want you to talk
to a friend of mine.

496
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:37,223
We've met before, haven't we?

497
01:39:38,683 --> 01:39:40,101
I don't think so.

498
01:39:42,312 --> 01:39:44,356
Where is it you think we've met?

499
01:39:44,689 --> 01:39:48,610
At your house.
Don't you remember?

500
01:39:52,364 --> 01:39:56,285
No. No, I don't.

501
01:39:57,745 --> 01:40:00,539
In the East, the far East...

502
01:40:00,748 --> 01:40:06,296
...when a person is sentenced
to death, they're sent to a place
where they can't escape.

503
01:40:06,921 --> 01:40:14,054
Never knowing when an executioner
may step up behind them and fire
a bullet into the back of their head.

504
01:40:15,387 --> 01:40:17,182
What's going on?

505
01:40:17,849 --> 01:40:20,477
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

506
01:40:21,436 --> 01:40:26,900
Pete, I just wanted to jump on
and tell you that I'm really glad
you're doing OK.

507
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:43,856
You got him.

508
01:43:45,066 --> 01:43:46,234
Alice!

509
01:44:43,544 --> 01:44:44,379
Wow!

510
01:44:48,174 --> 01:44:49,884
We killed him.

511
01:44:58,978 --> 01:45:01,105
You killed him.

512
01:45:04,232 --> 01:45:04,900
Alice?

513
01:45:10,698 --> 01:45:11,949
Alice?

514
01:45:13,409 --> 01:45:14,952
What do we do?

515
01:45:16,371 --> 01:45:18,081
What do we do?

516
01:45:19,374 --> 01:45:21,084
We have to get the stuff.

517
01:45:23,670 --> 01:45:25,213
We have to get out of here.

518
01:45:40,937 --> 01:45:42,105
Ah, fuck!

519
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,561
Is that you?

520
01:46:21,271 --> 01:46:22,774
Are both of them you?

521
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:33,785
That's me.

522
01:46:36,538 --> 01:46:38,999
Honey, are you all right?

523
01:46:44,046 --> 01:46:45,630
Where's the bathroom?

524
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:49,969
It's upstairs, down the hall.

525
01:47:47,529 --> 01:47:49,323
Did you want to talk to me?

526
01:47:52,284 --> 01:47:55,287
Did you want to ask me, why?

527
01:48:53,223 --> 01:48:54,391
What's the matter?

528
01:48:58,144 --> 01:48:59,646
Don't you trust me, Pete?

529
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:10,658
Stick this in your pants.

530
01:49:17,998 --> 01:49:20,294
I know a fence.

531
01:49:22,962 --> 01:49:27,758
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit

532
01:49:28,676 --> 01:49:29,927
and Andy's car...

533
01:49:31,387 --> 01:49:34,141
And then we can go anywhere.

534
01:49:49,532 --> 01:49:50,866
Come on, Baby!

535
01:50:07,383 --> 01:50:08,636
Pete, you drive!

536
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:27,029
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

537
01:50:29,657 --> 01:50:31,701
Where the fuck are we going?

538
01:50:34,538 --> 01:50:36,748
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

539
01:50:39,292 --> 01:50:41,753
The fence I told you about...

540
01:50:45,757 --> 01:50:47,300
He's at his cabin.

541
01:52:01,629 --> 01:52:02,630
Come on!

542
01:52:50,638 --> 01:52:52,515
We'll have to wait.

543
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:16,248
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

544
01:53:24,048 --> 01:53:26,259
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

545
01:53:30,096 --> 01:53:32,224
More than ever.

546
01:55:33,559 --> 01:55:34,727
I want you.

547
01:55:43,861 --> 01:55:45,197
I want you.

548
01:56:03,757 --> 01:56:04,925
I want you.

549
01:56:06,927 --> 01:56:08,095
I want you.

550
01:56:27,448 --> 01:56:31,620
You'll never have me.

551
01:57:36,437 --> 01:57:37,439
Here I am.

552
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:35,500
- Where's Alice?
- Alice who? Her name is Renee.

553
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:39,504
If she told you
her name is Alice, she's lying.

554
01:58:43,633 --> 01:58:47,887
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?!

555
02:02:10,725 --> 02:02:11,392
Renee?

556
02:02:21,819 --> 02:02:23,906
You're coming with me.

557
02:04:26,743 --> 02:04:29,454
What do you guys want?

558
02:05:44,532 --> 02:05:46,493
Now you can hand it back!

559
02:05:56,296 --> 02:05:58,505
You and me, Mister...

560
02:06:01,675 --> 02:06:05,722
We can really
outugly them sumbitches...

561
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:08,390
Can't we?

562
02:07:04,409 --> 02:07:06,869
Ed... Take a look at this!

563
02:07:13,835 --> 02:07:15,794
Yeah. That's her all right.

564
02:07:17,213 --> 02:07:20,717
That's Fred Madison's wife
with Dick Laurent.

565
02:07:21,134 --> 02:07:23,095
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

566
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:27,265
We got Pete Dayton's prints
all over this place.

567
02:07:28,225 --> 02:07:30,018
You know what I think, Ed?

568
02:07:31,853 --> 02:07:33,814
What is it, Al?
What do you think?

569
02:07:35,232 --> 02:07:37,985
I think there's no such thing
as a bad coincidence.

570
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:43,053
Dick Laurent is dead.
