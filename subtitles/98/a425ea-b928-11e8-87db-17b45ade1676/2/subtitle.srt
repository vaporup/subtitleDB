1
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:41,362
Take this and go home
Stay out of the rain

2
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:16,126
Dummy

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,834
Do you want to get electrocuted?

4
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,766
You're crazy

5
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:23,664
I don't want to split up like this

6
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,232
Let's talk just for a moment

7
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,641
Nothing can change

8
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:31,941
There's no use in talking
Let go of me!

9
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,369
Here's your letter

10
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:35,308
I don't want it anymore

11
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:36,838
Why?

12
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:40,881
There's no response and because of my conscience

13
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:43,619
I'll write it myself from now on

14
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:46,115
And tell her the truth

15
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:50,257
It's a golden opportunity

16
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,522
I heard she's very sick from the rain

17
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,191
So she's in the hospital

18
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,039
She's very sick?
Because of the rain?

19
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,631
Yeah

20
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,768
I'm going to see her

21
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:11,170
If I visit her when she's sick then I can score

22
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,986
I'll confess to her that I didn't write the letters

23
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,888
I won't tell her it was you

24
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:24,726
Actually
I'm not the type to like one girl

25
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:28,930
but I really like her

26
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,099
Oh Joon-ha!

27
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:33,298
Oh Joon-ha!

28
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:35,004
He's calling you

29
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,206
Yes?

30
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:41,371
Twenty four, twenty seven
Thirty, thirty two...

31
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,548
I have to eat all this?

32
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:46,016
Look at this

33
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:49,853
Mawworms, intestinal worms
hookworms, roundworms...

34
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:53,152
You have everything
What the hell did you eat?

35
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,191
Because of you our class has the most parasites

36
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:58,695
But sir it wasn't my manure

37
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,390
Then whose was it?

38
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:05,566
You're the only one who'd have
this many parasites, Eat it now!

39
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:23,285
YOON Tae-soo

40
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:29,015
Eat three

41
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:31,728
But it's the same manure

42
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:36,495
Yeah, but some spots have more parasites and some don't

43
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,817
How'd you know I was here?

44
00:04:58,922 --> 00:04:59,957
Why are you covering your face?

45
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:04,928
Stop it, I haven't washed my face, and it's dirty

46
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,555
But you're still pretty

47
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:09,891
- How'd you know I was here?
- I heard from Tae-soo

48
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,966
Why are you laughing?

49
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:19,271
I heard you ate 32 worm-killing pills

50
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,912
Tae-soo, that bastard has a big mouth

51
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:28,079
Did he say anything else?

52
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:42,558
After being silent for a while that's all he said and left

53
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,027
- Really?
- Yeah

54
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,733
He's so odd

55
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:54,066
- Are you very sick?
- Yeah

56
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:58,280
I'm sorry

57
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,816
I must be really stupid

58
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:08,523
Besides liking you
I'm not good at anything else

59
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:14,787
No, there's a lot you're good at

60
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:18,095
Like getting drenched and eating worm pills

61
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:23,231
Don't laugh
This is serious

62
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:29,107
I have to tell Tae-soo about us

63
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:33,912
Then we can clear our conscience

64
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:38,589
See you later

65
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:40,318
Is this her room?

66
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:50,027
My poor daughter-in-law!
How'd you get so drenched?

67
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,867
No, lie down

68
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:59,109
A cold can't be taken lightly
You can catch pneumonia

69
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,645
So, are you eating well?

70
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:06,344
You should eat well to recover

71
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:13,789
I'm sorry
This must be the wrong room

72
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:33,903
Wrong room

73
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,617
Clench your fists

74
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,721
Raise them like this

75
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:03,172
Now hit me

76
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,341
Why should I hit you?

77
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:05,638
Hurry and hit me!

78
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:10,174
I don't like hitting people or getting hit

79
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,882
My dad hit me too many times

80
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,543
I like Joo-hee

81
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:19,244
Actually, she gave me this necklace last summer

82
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,789
Are you okay?

83
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:28,789
Damn it
I've fallen again

84
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,329
Don't worry

85
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:38,202
And don't let my dad see that necklace

86
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,273
He'll get furious

87
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:46,644
That necklace was a gift from my dad

88
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:48,614
To Joo-hee

89
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:59,084
Oh Joon-ha!
It's your letter!

90
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,927
Later on, we went on school break

91
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:08,338
And I thought I couldn't see her again

92
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,238
I miss you

93
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,668
I miss you so much I'll die

94
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:18,878
And I'm curious how much our river has changed

95
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:25,978
Say hi to our haunted house
the shed, and our row boat

96
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:30,583
Say that I miss them and that I'm doing okay

97
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:36,492
Yesterday, Tae-soo came to me with your Uncle's address

98
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,533
He also confessed a shocking thing to me

99
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:46,899
That you were the one who wrote the letters to me

100
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:50,442
How could you hide that from me?

101
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:54,410
Anyway, it's okay

102
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:59,656
I almost threw away those letters

103
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:02,887
but now I can read them again and think of you

104
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:07,793
Tae-soo also made a suggestion

105
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:13,197
That you put Tae-soo's name on the letters you send me

106
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,899
Then my parents will think
that I'm exchanging letters with him

107
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,445
Look outside the window

108
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,445
If the branches swing gently in the wind

109
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:31,213
then the one you love is loving you, too

110
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:36,390
Right now it's snowing outside

111
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,727
When it first snows

112
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:42,096
they say you should stroll with your beloved

113
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:44,960
But I'm just writing a letter

114
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:48,593
Joon-ha, I miss you so much

115
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:52,798
I'm going to get permission to go to Grandpa's house

116
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:57,077
If I do
I'll send you a telegraph

117
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,114
Open your ears

118
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:01,513
If you hear your heartbeat

119
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:06,212
then the person you love is loving you, too

120
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,181
Close your eyes

121
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:10,723
If there's a smile on your lips

122
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:15,561
then the person you love is loving you, too

123
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:40,586
I want to send a telegraph

124
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,027
Then please sign up here

125
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,426
Okay

126
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:58,870
But fate must not be on my side

127
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,173
One of my letters

128
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:04,080
was returned back to Tae-soo's home

129
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,107
Joo-hee is in love with Joon-ha

130
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:15,185
I'm not in love with Joo-hee

131
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:22,556
Both of them really love each other

132
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,596
So that's why I gave up

133
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:32,164
Two people in love should be together

134
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:37,278
It's okay with me

135
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,441
No, I love her, too

136
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:44,182
I won't give up

137
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:52,328
Are you mocking me?
You always want things your way!

138
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:59,867
So your parents mean nothing to you?

139
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:04,737
Do you know who she is?
She's a congressman's daughter!

140
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:12,976
Know what that means, you punk?

141
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,847
You deserve to die

142
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,619
You can't even hold on to a girl

143
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,699
It was the end of a winter break?

144
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:40,536
I had hoped so much for

145
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:07,402
Know what this is?

146
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,073
A belt?

147
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:13,565
No, it's a whip

148
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,207
This bastard hits me

149
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:21,883
My dad doesn't want it to
but it keeps wanting to hit me

150
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:30,957
That's why I caught it
How should I punish it?

151
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:33,326
The death penalty

152
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:38,566
That's exactly what I thought

153
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:47,971
Kill it slowly and painfully?

154
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:55,148
Or starve it slowly to death?

155
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:59,222
Or give it sleeping pills?

156
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:01,122
Strangle it to death

157
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,355
Good idea

158
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,166
Joon-ha

159
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:20,273
Take good care of Joo-hee

160
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:41,351
Tae-soo!

161
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:46,522
Somebody help!

162
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:49,829
A person's dying!

163
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:51,234
Tae-soo, you bastard!

164
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,503
Tae-soo, you bastard!

165
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,206
Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on!

166
00:16:56,206 --> 00:17:01,377
Someone help me!
Somebody's dying!

167
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:05,211
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

168
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:12,649
I told you to kill the belt
not yourself

169
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:18,357
Tae-soo, wake up!
Open your eyes!

170
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:26,666
Don't die. Don't die
Don't die, you bastard!

171
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:30,173
Breathe! Breathe!

172
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:34,906
Breathe, you bastard!

173
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:28,527
Go inside

174
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:45,110
If you're with him
he'll wake up faster

175
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,717
Hurry

176
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:07,936
Wait here for me

177
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:39,695
Hurry and get well

178
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,632
Ji-hae, know what this is?

179
00:22:34,544 --> 00:22:36,205
An umbrella?

180
00:22:36,913 --> 00:22:38,681
A very special umbrella

181
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:41,809
They're all the same

182
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:47,755
It's special because Sang-min gave it to me

183
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:52,395
He must know that I like him

184
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:57,389
Thought he wouldn't
when you stare at him everyday?

185
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,770
Go give this to Sang-min

186
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,507
No, you give it to him
I'm not going there

187
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:06,065
Why not?

188
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:09,041
Did you and Soo-gyung fight?

189
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,512
Remember when it suddenly rained that day?

190
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:19,719
Sang-min was drinking coffee here

191
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:24,550
He was looking out of the window

192
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:29,360
then suddenly turned to me and said

193
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:35,500
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

194
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:40,741
And then I said
"I was worried I didn't"

195
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:46,846
He placed his umbrella here

196
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,079
and said
"You can have it"

197
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,351
He said he was okay to get wet

198
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:58,425
And then he ran off in the rain

199
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,362
Did you bring an umbrella?

200
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:18,012
You can have it.

201
00:24:23,352 --> 00:24:27,790
It's raining a lot outside

202
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,489
Sang-min might be getting soaked without an umbrella

203
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:53,880
This is a really special umbrella

204
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:59,053
I'll give it back to him

205
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:08,955
Did you bring an umbrella?

206
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:10,766
Of course, I did

207
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:12,199
Really?

208
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:15,497
But still, take mine

209
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:22,400
Is she crazy?

210
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:45,084
You have an umbrella
but why are you so soaked?

211
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:49,889
It's not mine

212
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:52,566
I came to return it to you

213
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:55,931
You left it at the store

214
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,137
I'm not the only one
who gets wet even with an umbrella, am I?

215
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,951
Don't go

216
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,664
You already know...

217
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,296
my feelings

218
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:35,206
Now, you know it all

219
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,677
Yeah

220
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:47,884
when I saw you run without an umbrella

221
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,327
I left my umbrella behind

222
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:58,926
Even on the day of the play

223
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:06,365
I wanted to give you a present
so I bought Soo-gyung's, too

224
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,543
And if fate was on my side

225
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:17,585
I thought you'd pick the gift with the card in it

226
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:22,352
I thought we'd grow distant

227
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:26,087
if I confessed my feelings

228
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:30,894
I wanted to say that I liked you,
but I couldn't

229
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:35,436
I'll come see the play

230
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:49,311
Look
I cut my wrists

231
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,616
I saw it all
Both of you whispering love

232
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:58,291
Do you really love her?

233
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:00,429
Is it really so?

234
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:02,624
I'm working out my feelings

235
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:06,463
My eyes were looking straight

236
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:08,626
but my heart was confused

237
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:11,865
Can I trust those words?

238
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,903
Can I think of it as a promise?

239
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:18,771
Yes

240
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:23,282
There's only one that I love

241
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:27,089
That one is me, right?

242
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:28,681
Yes, I love you

243
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:30,759
I swear that I love you

244
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,329
I love you, too

245
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:35,331
Sang-min
I love you so much

246
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:36,764
Sang-min!

247
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:59,380
What the hell are you doing?

248
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:02,852
I didn't even finish my lines
and then you call out my name?

249
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:04,660
You can't just change your lines like that

250
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,261
You ruined everything!

251
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:09,865
Sang-min, I wasn't acting
it was my true feelings

252
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:11,800
I love you
Love is more important than a play

253
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,960
I love you

254
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,865
After the play Sang-min and I went on a date

255
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,161
We decided to go to the river

256
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:52,639
where my mother's memories lay

257
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,443
Joo-hee?

258
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:09,958
No, I'm her daughter
My name is Ji-hae

259
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,823
Is that so?

260
00:31:12,227 --> 00:31:14,218
I must've made a mistake

261
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,656
But you look so much like your mom

262
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:23,439
I delivered a lot of your mom's letters

263
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:24,736
Thank you, sir

264
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:51,027
I know well what happened to my parents afterwards

265
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,204
Students and citizens!

266
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:02,441
This is illegal demonstrations!

267
00:32:04,012 --> 00:32:06,381
Eliminate corruption and establish a new state!
A new state!

268
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,350
Down with dictatorship and the military regime!

269
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,944
Down with the regime!
Down with dictatorship!

270
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:53,321
If you wipe on toothpaste
your eyes will hurt less

271
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:59,126
- Joo-hee?
- Tae-soo?

272
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,127
Put on toothpaste

273
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:37,733
It's been a long time

274
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:41,572
It has

275
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:50,974
Have you heard from Joon-ha?

276
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,865
Joon-ha!

277
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:16,668
Joon-ha!

278
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,506
Joon-ha!

279
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,918
Joon-ha!

280
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,114
Joon-ha!

281
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:39,955
Joon-ha!

282
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:49,393
Joon-ha
come back alive!

283
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:57,678
Joon-ah!
You have to come back alive!

284
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,907
Joon-ha!

285
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:04,915
Joon-ha
answer me!

286
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:06,882
Joon-ha!

287
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:18,361
Joon-ha...
come back alive!

288
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:25,601
Joon-ha
come back alive!

289
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:29,703
Joon-ha!

290
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:40,811
Joon-ha!

291
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:43,489
Joon-ha!

292
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,525
Joon-ha!

293
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:48,594
Joon-ha!

294
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:51,760
Joon-ha!

295
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:56,097
Joon-ha!

296
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:59,403
Joo-hee!

297
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:08,444
- Joon-ha!
- Joo-hee!

298
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:12,421
- Joo-hee!
- Joon-ha!

299
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:13,479
Tae-soo!

300
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,019
Joon-ha!

301
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,888
Joon-ha!

302
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:24,331
Joon-ha!

303
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,706
You have to come back alive!

304
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:33,298
Joon-ha!

305
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:37,439
Joon-ha
come back alive!

306
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:41,109
You have to come back alive!

307
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,178
Got it?

308
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:43,630
Medic! Medic!

309
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:48,470
Hold on! Hold on!
Breathe! Breathe!

310
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:50,576
Stop it!

311
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:53,443
He's dead! Retreat!
Get moving, you bastard!

312
00:40:57,779 --> 00:40:59,178
Joon-ha, you bastard!

313
00:40:59,514 --> 00:41:02,483
Where are you going?

314
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:05,943
Come back!
Corporal OH!

315
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:16,131
You haven't changed at all

316
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,599
Just like in the past

317
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:22,867
you're still pretty

318
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:30,512
I've aged a lot

319
00:45:41,296 --> 00:45:47,326
- You had it hard, huh?
- Not really

320
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:58,669
How's Tae-soo doing?

321
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,381
I guess he's doing alright

322
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:18,828
Why didn't you get married?

323
00:46:23,972 --> 00:46:28,033
Well, I did

324
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:39,714
I heard

325
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:48,057
I had so much to tell you

326
00:46:48,229 --> 00:46:53,758
But now that we've met
I can't remember

327
00:47:08,716 --> 00:47:11,708
It's a piano doll

328
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:14,515
We have one at my home, too

329
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:22,563
When I look at it
it reminds me of you playing the piano

330
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:33,000
It looks so much like you back then

331
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:36,136
Doesn't it?

332
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:54,487
We were so innocent back then

333
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:57,554
But the past has gone now

334
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:04,072
I think our feelings took the best of us

335
00:48:04,072 --> 00:48:09,533
We cried and laughed at the smallest things

336
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:42,509
How do I look right now?

337
00:48:45,012 --> 00:48:47,276
You look healthy

338
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:55,683
But I'd like to see you look happier

339
00:49:00,294 --> 00:49:07,200
I'm crying right now
Can't you see my tears?

340
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:20,144
Why did you hide that you couldn't see?

341
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:32,657
It's late

342
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:35,455
Sorry, I have an appointment

343
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,723
I have to go

344
00:50:30,852 --> 00:50:32,547
I'm sorry

345
00:50:32,687 --> 00:50:37,818
It was almost perfect
I could've succeeded

346
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:43,827
I even came here last night to practice

347
00:50:46,067 --> 00:50:49,059
You almost fooled me

348
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:56,709
You did a good job
I nearly believed you

349
00:50:57,712 --> 00:50:59,907
Also...

350
00:51:03,885 --> 00:51:09,949
I risked my life to return this necklace to you

351
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:20,291
Please don't

352
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:26,432
This necklace is yours

353
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:33,338
Afterwards, mom and dad got married
And I was born three years later

354
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:39,004
Then a few years later...

355
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:18,652
Mrs. Sung Joo-hee?

356
00:53:28,529 --> 00:53:30,429
Joon-ha's last wish

357
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:39,966
was for you to spread his dust in this river

358
00:53:44,345 --> 00:53:46,245
Actually

359
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:49,149
Joon-ha

360
00:53:50,985 --> 00:53:55,854
got married right after you did

361
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:05,098
Poor guy had a son, too

362
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:33,656
And Joon-ha

363
00:54:33,928 --> 00:54:37,523
wanted you to have this

364
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:39,624
Mommy, it's a rainbow

365
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:52,969
I still remember clearly the rainbow I saw that day

366
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,568
Until I finished telling this story

367
00:59:59,286 --> 01:00:00,753
Open your hands
