1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,699
<i>I felt like I had a lot of time.</i>

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,064
I know.

3
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:14,031
It's good.
I'm good.

4
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:17,664
<i>Yeah. We're, um... we're
just getting off the freeway.</i>

5
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:19,265
Yeah?

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,731
Did, Hugh pick you up
at the office, or...

7
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:24,331
<i>Yeah, he was coming in
from Oakland.</i>

8
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:27,863
<i>He was late, of course.
Then I took him...</i>

9
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:32,263
<i>And then, he took me
to some lawyer bar.</i>

10
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:33,263
A lawyer bar?

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,896
<i>Yeah. A lawyer bar, kind of.</i>

12
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:40,396
<i>Yeah. I don't know. Everybody
there seemed like a lawyer.</i>

13
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:42,529
<i>I felt like I was the only
person without a tie.</i>

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,212
Well, maybe we should get you
a tie for emergencies.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,662
<i>Yeah, wardrobe emergencies.</i>

16
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:49,295
Yeah.

17
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:53,995
<i>Anyhow, we tried to take
the freeway and...</i>

18
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:56,761
Ke... Kevin?

19
00:00:56,762 --> 00:00:59,194
I can barely hear you.

20
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:01,695
<i>Is that better?</i>

21
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,761
Not much.

22
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:06,627
<i>Where are you?
Are you there yet?</i>

23
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:11,892
Yeah, I... I'm just
pulling up right now.

24
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:14,297
I just got here.
Um...

25
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:18,660
Yeah. I'm right here.

26
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,859
I... You know what? I need to parallel
park and I'm not on my earpiece.

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,725
<i>Okay.</i>

28
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:26,893
Are you good?

29
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:28,591
<i>Yeah.</i>

30
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:30,692
<i>You know, we should
talk about, you know...</i>

31
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:32,626
<i>Maybe we can
talk about, you know,</i>

32
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:35,492
<i>that little problem before
we get into the party.</i>

33
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:37,492
Okay.

34
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:40,794
Is it something we should
talk about now, or...

35
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,724
Hello?

36
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,658
Kevin?

37
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,758
I lost you.

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,425
Oh.

39
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,792
Baby?

40
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:57,759
You gotta be kidding me.

41
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:02,156
I think olive oil would be good.
A little more maybe?

42
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:03,624
- A drizzle.
- A little more.

43
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,676
- Is this turning you on?
- That is hot.

44
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:08,688
See how you're slipping?
This is...

45
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:11,290
- It's... It's the bread, babe.
- It's the two of you with the knives that...

46
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,322
I have not had carbs for a week.

47
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:15,121
I've been on this...
this "cleanse."

48
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:17,255
How long have you
been cleansing for?

49
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:19,256
About 21 days.

50
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:21,822
I had my juice and my
smoothie earlier today...

51
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:24,254
and I do feel very, you know...

52
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:27,155
- Cleansed? Open?
- A little faint maybe?

53
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,720
But I'm gonna eat,

54
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,455
I'm gonna drink
and have a good time.

55
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:32,421
Hi.

56
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:34,054
- Hey.
- How are you guys?

57
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:36,320
Nice to see you.

58
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:38,619
- Bend down to my level, please.
- I know.

59
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,653
So, I just had Kevin on the
phone and this happened.

60
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,252
It cracked.

61
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:44,821
As I was talking to him.

62
00:02:44,822 --> 00:02:46,721
- You dropped it.
- Our connection... No, I didn't drop it.

63
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,752
It just cracked
as I was holding it.

64
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,521
Do you have insurance?

65
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:52,354
I... I actually
don't know if I do.

66
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,653
Do you have the Skype app
I showed you?

67
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,552
No, I think it's fine. He just said
he wanted to talk about something,

68
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,084
But on the news, you know,
they're talking about the comet.

69
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,619
- Yeah.
- The Miller's Comet.

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,519
And they keep telling people
that this can happen.

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,185
Yeah. I don't think
it's the comet.

72
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,253
If you have Skype,
it uses the home Wi-Fi.

73
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,285
No. The interference.
They're saying things break.

74
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,788
Hey, do you want some wine?

75
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:20,851
Did Amir mention to you that...

76
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,584
he's bringing Laurie...

77
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:24,987
to dinner?

78
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:27,449
He's bringing Laurie?

79
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,815
<i>Yeah. The Laurie.</i>

80
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:33,816
Um, no, I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.

81
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,284
- Who's Laurie?
- Well, he is.

82
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:39,083
- You know Laurie.
- Oh, Mike.

83
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:44,016
Long black hair.
Kind of vixeny.

84
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:46,282
Wild and sexy.

85
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:48,782
- Oh.
- Kinda strange, very mysterious.

86
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,315
- Very tight, tight, tight dresses.
- Listen.

87
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:54,015
It's totally fine.
It's such an Amir thing to do.

88
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,615
I was going to keep this...

89
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:57,648
This, my friends.

90
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:01,548
It's my own little rescue
remedy concoction.

91
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,114
- Right.
- It's our own mix.

92
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:06,814
- It's pretty s... It's very safe, I think.
- Do you want a needle for that?

93
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,314
- Is it clean?
- You can drop it into some water.

94
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,314
Just take the edge off,
in case you're worried.

95
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:13,348
I don't know.
I'm just... I'm offering.

96
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,680
It's echinacea, passion
flower, a little valerian...

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,347
and ketamine.

98
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,714
- So it's all natural.
- Ketamine?

99
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:22,146
That doesn't sound natural at all.
That's a horse tranquilizer.

100
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:24,680
- Yeah, but it's just a whisper of ketamine.
- I did that once.

101
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,680
I just thought maybe
a celebration...

102
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,978
Are you offering this to me,
because Laurie's coming here?

103
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,512
Well, I'm just saying...

104
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,646
- Now it's a party.
- Ketamine or cheese?

105
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:36,446
It's right here if you change your mind.
Oh, this is nice.

106
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:38,113
Where'd you get this?

107
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:39,546
Galaxy, that thrift store.

108
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,679
- Oh, I love that place.
- Me too. I know.

109
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,379
Oh. Hi.

110
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,079
- Hi, baby.
- What?

111
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,045
- Come on. Come here.
- All right.

112
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,711
My wife.

113
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:50,947
- Hi.
- Hey.

114
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,777
- How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

115
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:56,445
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:59,044
- Do you guys want wine?
- I do.

117
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,047
Cheese? Ketamine?

118
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,744
You look so good in leather.

119
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,510
Jesus Christ.

120
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:08,352
- Um...
- I want water or something.

121
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,942
Did you know that, um,

122
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:16,475
- Laurie is coming?
- There you go.

123
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,976
No.

124
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,608
- Laurie's coming?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:22,476
Look at the smile on your face.

126
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:25,276
- It's not a smile. It's not that smile.
- Oh. my God.

127
00:05:25,277 --> 00:05:27,574
- Why is she coming tonight?
- Amir's bringing her.

128
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:30,374
Beats me, because Amir's
a total jackass.

129
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,575
Oh.

130
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:34,208
You know what? Put a quarter
into the swear jar.

131
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,108
So, who did he tell?

132
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:38,174
Well, we got the...
Yeah.

133
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,308
We got an e-mail about it.
Just his plus one.

134
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:43,246
Plus one and then I
was, like, plus what?

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,238
I need to know tonight?

136
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:54,106
My editor needs to know how
to book hotels and flights.

137
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,643
I gotta do it.
Let them know.

138
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,444
Gotta know tonight.

139
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:05,407
You know I-I...
I can't...

140
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,073
I-I just need
to think about it...

141
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,905
a little bit longer because...

142
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:10,605
I just don't want to
make the wrong choice.

143
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:12,173
What if you came
for a shorter time?

144
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:15,381
Like a month, not the full four months.
Just come for a month.

145
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:17,540
It's still a very long time...

146
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,305
and I'm not saying no.

147
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:23,673
Babe, if you don't say yes,
it becomes a no.

148
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,638
We're cold and hungry.

149
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,603
Hello?

150
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:32,404
- Hello.
- Hi.

151
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:35,137
- Amir, you look great.
- Thank you.

152
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:36,837
- Hi.
- You remember Laurie?

153
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,363
Amir told me I wouldn't be...

154
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:40,970
- overdressed, now I'm feeling...
- No. No, no.

155
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,272
We're underdressed.

156
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,069
- Hi.
- Hi.

157
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,602
- How are you?
- I'm good.

158
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:49,437
- Beth, do you remember Laurie?
- Yes.

159
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,102
- Nice to see you.
- You guys already said hello and...

160
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,768
How are you?
Good to see you.

161
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:56,069
You guys want red wine?

162
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,636
Yes. I would
love red wine.

163
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:01,101
- Lee?
- I've been cooking. I've been cooking.

164
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,802
- How have you been?
- I've been good. I've been really good.

165
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:05,868
- You?
- I've been great.

166
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:09,434
Yeah. Life is looking very different
from how it was a while back.

167
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:12,135
- In a good way, so...
- Well, cool. That's good to hear.

168
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:15,003
- I would hope so. There you go.
- Thank you.

169
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,767
Not A, C, E.

170
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:20,400
"Horace, listen.

171
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:23,100
I'll be down at the pyramid.
Come on down and join.

172
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,167
We gotta talk
about some deity stuff."

173
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:27,266
Does everyone else
still not have service?

174
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,933
My phone is completely broken.

175
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm living in the moment, but...

176
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,466
- Nothing.
- I got zero.

177
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,198
That's weird.
Maybe the tower's down.

178
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,232
The tower's down?

179
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,333
I'm telling you guys...

180
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:44,298
- It's not down.
- That would be a big news story.

181
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:47,365
Comet. Comet.

182
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,365
- Miller's Comet.
- Yes. Thank you.

183
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:54,964
I read something this morning
about a comet in the 1930s.

184
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:56,499
It was in Finland.

185
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,331
- Knocked out all of the...
- I actually...

186
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,797
the cell towers?

187
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:04,164
Actually, it was in 1923.

188
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:05,830
And, yes, it was in Finland.

189
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:09,430
- Um...
- Thank you, Wikipedia.

190
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:12,196
It was actually crazy,
because it affected the people.

191
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:14,598
After it passed,
they would get lost.

192
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,796
They would end up in the wrong home.
They would forget things.

193
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,864
They wouldn't really
know where they were.

194
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:22,495
And I remember reading
about this one woman...

195
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:25,096
who called the police and said,

196
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:27,164
"The man in my house
is not my husband."

197
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,429
And then police came over...

198
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:32,229
and they said, "This
is your husband,"

199
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,829
And she said, "No. This
is not my husband.

200
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,128
- I killed my husband yesterday.
- Awesome.

201
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,829
That's how I know
it's not him."

202
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,462
But they couldn't arrest her,
because he was standing...

203
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,195
right there in front in them.

204
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:44,261
Do they have
any theories of why?

205
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:47,493
Think how lucky she is. She
gets to kill him again.

206
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,126
Clearly she wants
to kill this man.

207
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:50,728
- It's just the Finnish.
- The Finns.

208
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,660
The Finns or Finnish?

209
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:55,194
- You guys remember Halley's Comet?
- Yes.

210
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,861
I mean, it was such a big deal.

211
00:08:56,862 --> 00:09:00,526
I remember at my school, we all had
to, like, reenact Halley's Comet.

212
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:04,426
So, they assigned each of us
something celestial to do.

213
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,893
My sister got to be Halley's Comet.
I was very jealous.

214
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:09,626
I've never met your sister.
Have you guys met her sister?

215
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,960
There's a picture of her right
over there on the mantel, but...

216
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:14,425
- She's only a fleeting comet.
- she looks a little ridiculous.

217
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:16,225
- That's your sister?
- But why did you put it...

218
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,926
It's the door to nowhere.

219
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:19,760
In feng shui, a useless door,

220
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:21,359
which this is obviously
a useless door,

221
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,392
you put a picture of someone...

222
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:25,259
you have unresolved
issues with...

223
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,359
and it causes all
of this weird energy flow.

224
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,490
I don't even like
being over here.

225
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,257
- It's freaky.
- You shouldn't be over there then.

226
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:33,824
- Every time you're...
- I'm sort of an empath.

227
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:36,979
- Sort of an empath.
- And I can feel it. It's like a vortex.

228
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,191
When was the last time we
were all together like this?

229
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,323
I was thinking, right
before Thanksgiving,

230
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:45,424
most of us were there, but
not everybody could be.

231
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:47,056
I don't think Laurie...
Laura?

232
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:48,591
- Laurie.
- Laurie.

233
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,589
Sorry. We're gonna tell
all these stories.

234
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,390
We do that when we get together.

235
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,555
So Laurie, what are
you doing these days?

236
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:56,722
- Well, I'm...
- Keeping yourself busy?

237
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:58,222
I'm keeping busy.

238
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,389
I'm actually working with some
outreach programs in Silicon Valley.

239
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,758
We work with
at-risk youth.

240
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,188
Oh, wow. Didn't you...
No, no, no.

241
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,190
Are you still teaching the yoga?

242
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,355
The Spanish Yoga?
The Spoga?

243
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,955
- No. Not me.
- Are you sure that...

244
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,621
Oh, that must've
been another girl...

245
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:16,921
that Kevin dated that
Amir is hooking up with.

246
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,322
Wow.
Let's give him a shovel.

247
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,421
What are you doing? What
do you do for a living?

248
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:24,354
I act.
Shut up, guys.

249
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:26,252
I didn't remember
you were an actor.

250
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:29,152
- So, you do mainly theater?
- Well, I did.

251
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:33,787
Since I moved down here to support
my wife and her Skyping career.

252
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:38,253
Um, but, no, I was in a TV
show for about four years.

253
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,119
<i>- Yeah? What was that?
- It was called Roswell.</i>

254
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,986
<i>Oh, my God.
I love Roswell.</i>

255
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:45,053
<i>When were you on Roswell?
What episodes were you on?</i>

256
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:47,786
I was on all shows.
Produced.

257
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:50,252
- What do you mean?
- I was a series regular on that show.

258
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,886
Yeah, he was,
like, the main guy.

259
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:53,386
What character did you play?

260
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,984
- Joe.
- Did you have different hair, or something?

261
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:58,551
I had the same exact hair.

262
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:01,484
I'm sorry. Maybe it's one of
those things where you know...

263
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,584
the character for so long, then you see
someone in person. It just doesn't compute.

264
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:05,951
I don't know.

265
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:10,653
- He's sort of grown into his face.
- You really have.

266
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,216
Check it out again.

267
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:16,317
I'm sure, you know, like the downward
dog probably gets to your head.

268
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:18,584
- I didn't do yoga. That wasn't...
- Well, hey, listen.

269
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:20,983
Thanks for enjoying the show.

270
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:23,484
I think you are
a really good actor...

271
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:25,116
and I think you should
continue doing it.

272
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,316
- Thank you very much.
- I think it would be well worth your time.

273
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:30,083
What are you up to these days?

274
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,983
Last I remember, you were, like,

275
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,314
taking the dance world by storm.

276
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,349
Um, I guess the last time
I saw you...

277
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,982
must've been when I was
creating the dance show.

278
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:43,448
It was going really,
really well for a while,

279
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:47,015
but then, right before
the, um... the premiere,

280
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:49,581
they brought in
Svetlana Aserrano...

281
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:53,615
<i>who is the best dancer
in the world really,</i>

282
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:55,681
and they just offered me
the understudy.

283
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,481
She should've been
the whole thing.

284
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,214
She created it.
She should be...

285
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,705
- the prima ballerina of the San Francisco Ballet.
- That's terrible.

286
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,848
You know, you hear these
stories sometimes...

287
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:07,080
about people being shut out
of things they created...

288
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,680
and I think it's horrible.
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:13,847
But I mean it's a good lesson
that I had to learn, because...

290
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:16,279
You know, because of my pride,
I didn't want...

291
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,412
to take the understudy
and I took too long...

292
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:22,412
to think about it and then
I lost the understudy job.

293
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:25,743
And they gave that to
Katherine Meriss and...

294
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,079
And she sucks.

295
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,745
- She sucks.
- No, she's good, guys.

296
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,612
Anyways, the reason
that she's really big now...

297
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:32,511
is because she ended up
going up.

298
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:34,177
Svetlana pulled out
last minute...

299
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:37,847
and Katherine ended up
doing the show.

300
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,944
- Katherine Meriss?
- Exactly.

301
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,943
As soon as you said that, I
thought, "Katherine Meriss...

302
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,676
that's pretty much the only
person in dance I'd know."

303
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:47,610
Right. Well...

304
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:51,510
So, she basically stole
your... your whole thing?

305
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:55,176
Katherine Meriss has
your life, basically.

306
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:57,944
- Career.
- You have your life.

307
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,677
It's a shame that it happened. She
doesn't hold a candle to you.

308
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:04,009
Then, here's to the life
that we do lead.

309
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,576
- Yeah.
- Well said.

310
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,077
- Here's to the comet.
- The comet. And the comet.

311
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:10,441
Anybody have a happier story?

312
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,608
Kevin, tell a crazy story, first
one that comes in your head.

313
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,108
No. All right.

314
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:18,042
Um...
Sorry.

315
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,575
I was going out with Laurie.

316
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,241
We were drinking
way too much at a bar.

317
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:24,742
I passed out and I
started dreaming...

318
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:27,442
this big black bear...

319
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:30,841
was up on its hind legs
sort of mauling me.

320
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:33,575
Slowly. Tenderly.

321
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,109
Anyhow, we go to some party...

322
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,240
in Santa Cruz
and as we walked in,

323
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,607
this huge dog comes
running straight at me.

324
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,140
Jumps up on its hind legs
and starts pawing me,

325
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:45,539
exactly like the dream,
and this guy yells,

326
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,072
- "Bear, get down, Bear."
- What?

327
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:52,638
Wow.
You have a gift.

328
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,773
The way you told
that story, I thought...

329
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:56,772
somebody was going to die.

330
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:59,772
You know Bear is
the most common dog name.

331
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,707
Oh, that makes it a much
less interesting story.

332
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:05,339
Thanks for that, Lee.

333
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,674
Most common bear name?
Henry.

334
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:12,505
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

335
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:14,638
- What?
- This is like your phone.

336
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,736
Oh, my God. That happened
to my phone tonight.

337
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:19,305
And I was just holding
mine in my hand.

338
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,703
- Exact same thing.
- Shattered?

339
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:24,037
Yeah. This is what they were
talking about on the news.

340
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:25,837
Yeah. Yeah.
It must be the comet.

341
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:28,038
- The chicken tastes like tuna.
- All right.

342
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:29,972
It must be Miller's Comet.

343
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,736
So, nobody's phone works?

344
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,668
I haven't checked mine,
but I assume it doesn't.

345
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,569
Everyone else's
is in the other room.

346
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,105
- Do you guys have a landline?
- No. We're wireless, baby.

347
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:45,470
All right. I need to get
ahold of my brother.

348
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:48,068
- What about, um, your deal...
- The computer.

349
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:49,567
- Good idea.
- It's in the office.

350
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,300
- Could I?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

351
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:53,601
- What's wrong with your brother?
- Nothing. He's fine.

352
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,967
He just, um...
You know Brian.

353
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:59,666
He hangs out with all those, you
know, theoretical physicists.

354
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,101
- No Internet.
- No?

355
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,001
- On the computer.
- How is there no Internet?

356
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:07,067
- You run Skype. You tell us.
- I know.

357
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,733
What are they saying
about the comet?

358
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:13,099
Nothing... Nothing
to get upset about.

359
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,533
He just said to give him a call,

360
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:17,534
you know, if there was
anything weird going on.

361
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:19,366
Like, why? What did
he think it could do?

362
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,000
Why didn't you tell me this?

363
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,566
Because of your feng shui...

364
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,032
- and granola candles, and I didn't want to...
- Stop making fun of me.

365
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,532
I'm not making fun of you.

366
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,966
There's a massive
celestial object,

367
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,665
and I didn't
want to freak you out.

368
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,266
- Now you're freaking me out.
- You guys realize...

369
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,732
<i>I was on a show
called Roswell...</i>

370
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,299
and we tackled these issues
every week.

371
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,298
That's true.

372
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:39,732
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

373
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,697
- Honey.
- Um, I'm on it.

374
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:43,297
Do we have candles?

375
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:44,799
I'm so glad I'm not high.

376
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,363
I don't want to sit
by the door to nowhere.

377
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,964
Mike, check the breakers.

378
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:54,397
I'm going to turn the lighter
on then come to you.

379
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:57,263
- You guys need help?
- No. I have matches.

380
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:59,931
- Candle power?
- I've got some over here.

381
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:03,429
I got blue glowsticks, red
glowsticks and green glowsticks.

382
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,195
Guys, let's just
light candles and...

383
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,163
Oh.

384
00:16:08,164 --> 00:16:10,263
- Hey.
- Everybody rave.

385
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,197
- Are you going outside?
- Yeah.

386
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:13,696
What do you mean,
you're going outside?

387
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:16,747
I'm gonna see if the power's
off in the whole neighborhood.

388
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:24,096
I decided this is
where mine goes.

389
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:26,962
Well, this is a little strange,

390
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:28,828
but the whole
neighborhood is out...

391
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:31,827
of power, except for a house
about two blocks up,

392
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,328
which is completely lit up.

393
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:35,060
It's kind of
beautiful, actually.

394
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,794
- The house?
- I want to go see.

395
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:41,527
- Let's go check it out.
- I've never seen it so dark outside before.

396
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,794
- You can't leave me. I'm gonna go.
- Come on then.

397
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,259
Don't leave me by myself.

398
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,360
- Where?
- You don't see it?

399
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:50,960
- It's right there.
- Why are you so far ahead of everyone?

400
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:52,994
Amir, dude, I can't see you.

401
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,026
- Let Laurie go first.
- Thanks a lot.

402
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,027
- That's sweet.
- Baby. Don't go.

403
00:16:58,028 --> 00:16:59,992
- Come here.
- See? Look.

404
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,063
- Everything done.
- Come here.

405
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,560
See that?

406
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,926
- Two blocks down.
- Oh, they have light.

407
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,725
- That one house has light.
- They must have a...

408
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,358
- A generator, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.

409
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,990
What is that, two blocks away?

410
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,491
Could solar power do that?

411
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:19,890
But would their landline
be working?

412
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:21,358
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

413
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,758
- Oh, wow.
- It's magnificent.

414
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,194
Holy moly.

415
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,724
Well, I'm freezing.

416
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,424
Should we head over
there, or should we...

417
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:35,529
- No.
- Maybe we should head back inside.

418
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,724
That was awesome, right?

419
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:45,088
- I didn't even see this get knocked over.
- No.

420
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,890
I didn't even know
that glass was out here.

421
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,456
I never go down
into the basement.

422
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:51,422
Guys, listen. Seriously,
what's up with that house?

423
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,155
- Why are they...?
- What?

424
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,721
It could be a generator.

425
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:55,623
Really?

426
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:58,221
I don't know. Maybe they're
just off-the-grid bastard...

427
00:17:58,222 --> 00:17:59,755
Well, apparently,
we have a generator.

428
00:17:59,756 --> 00:18:01,688
That would make sense if
they were off the grid.

429
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:05,787
I'm actually thinking of...
of going over there.

430
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,420
What?

431
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,055
- No, you're not going over there.
- Honey, it's okay.

432
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,520
- It's o...
- It's ridiculous.

433
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:15,053
It's not that far.
Look, look, look, look.

434
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,486
My brother, he says...

435
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:21,187
he said that if... if anything
strange were to happen...

436
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:23,553
while the comet
was passing over...

437
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:26,886
- that we should stay inside.
- What?

438
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:28,587
Just hold on, Amir.

439
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:32,219
That we should stay inside and that
I should do my best to contact him.

440
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,718
And so that's all
that I'm doing.

441
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:37,886
He said if anything strange
should happen? I mean...

442
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,686
I'm not the only one who
thinks this is strange.

443
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,619
- What is weird?
- Didn't he say to stay inside though?

444
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,684
What's more important
than the other?

445
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:47,585
Yes, but this overrides that,
and it's only two blocks away.

446
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,785
I'll be back
in, like, five minutes.

447
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:52,551
- Well, then you can't go by yourself.
- I'm going with him.

448
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:55,218
There you go.
I'll take Amir.

449
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,584
- I'm the least important person here.
- This is true.

450
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,317
It's about time you
started realizing that.

451
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:02,051
- Just stay here.
- Why are you going now?

452
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,550
Well, bring your glowsticks
so we can identify your bodies.

453
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,602
- Good idea.
- Thanks. That helps a lot.

454
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,983
- Don't listen to them.
- That's great.

455
00:19:08,984 --> 00:19:10,484
Five minutes, all right?

456
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,216
- Okay. Five minutes.
- All right. Okay.

457
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,017
Beth, I-I couldn't
find my shoes.

458
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,483
I'm borrowing yours.
I'm sorry.

459
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,120
That's so Amir.

460
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:22,250
- Ten minutes we give them.
- They will be fine.

461
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:25,416
We're just rattled because we're
addicted to cell phones and Internet.

462
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,648
We are. What did we do
before cell phones?

463
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:31,116
Em, you seem to be the
comet expert here tonight.

464
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:32,681
What happened the last time?

465
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,648
This one passed over a hundred
years ago, but much farther.

466
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:38,048
But do we know that
anything happened?

467
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,448
Nothing happened then.
It was too far away.

468
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,148
So, is there any reason...

469
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,648
we should be
freaked out right now?

470
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,114
Well, I mean, it is
a lot closer this time.

471
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,014
What does that mean?

472
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,435
Okay. I read
one more thing.

473
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,614
- Oh, another story.
- Just one more.

474
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,379
It's called
the Tunguska Event...

475
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,413
and, um, it was a comet...

476
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,313
or a meteor
or something like that...

477
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:02,979
that entered the
atmosphere over Siberia...

478
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,813
and exploded over Earth.

479
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:08,313
So, it didn't actually
have physical impact.

480
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:10,246
It didn't touch Earth.

481
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:11,685
It didn't leave
a crater or anything,

482
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,311
but the force
of that explosion...

483
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:18,112
flattened trees
for hundreds of miles.

484
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:21,378
But it only killed
about one to two people.

485
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:24,311
It's Siberia. There were
probably only two people there.

486
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:25,911
Yeah, but they don't
necessarily...

487
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:28,377
- It wiped out the population of Siberia.
- Basically. Yeah.

488
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:30,110
- Right.
- Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

489
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,945
And when was this?

490
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,078
It was, like, in 1908, 1903...

491
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,510
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. What is...

492
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:42,011
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

493
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:44,045
- Lock that front door.
- Don't open the door.

494
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:46,142
- I'm gonna get the bat.
- Yeah. Give me the bat.

495
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,776
Mike, is that door locked?

496
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:49,876
- I'll check it.
- Babe, stay away from the door.

497
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:51,510
- You need the stick?
- Thank you.

498
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,009
No, no, no.

499
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:57,784
- I just want to see what the hell is out there.
- Oh, my God.

500
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,643
- Don't open it.
- Oh, God.

501
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:02,578
Please, don't open that.

502
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,341
- Is anybody there?
- Front door's locked. There's nothing.

503
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,076
There's nothing out there.

504
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:10,874
Thought I was going
to have a heart attack.

505
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,708
Everybody all right?

506
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,675
Check the generator, please.
Please try the generator.

507
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,509
- I'll check the generator.
- Would the guys do that?

508
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,508
No. The guys would not
do anything like that.

509
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,208
They're not stupid.
They wouldn't do that.

510
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,873
- How long have they been gone?
- Like ten minutes.

511
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:25,573
Five minutes out, five minutes back.
They should be back by now.

512
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:27,307
So, they should be back by now.

513
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:29,807
- Okay. I think we should go get them.
- No, no, no.

514
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:31,306
I want to go get my husband.

515
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:33,206
We need to do it together
this time, guys.

516
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:34,940
That's fine with me.
I just want to go.

517
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:38,207
- Don't go outside.
- I'm not going anywhere. I'm just...

518
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:42,007
We should go get them.
We can all go together.

519
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:46,073
Okay, all right.
This is good.

520
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,506
Is that the grid
or the generator?

521
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,438
No, it's just us.
He must have gotten it going.

522
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,973
There's no other lights on?
It's just us?

523
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:55,392
- It's pitch black out there. At least it's on.
- So it must be...

524
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,903
- Well done.
- Thank you.

525
00:21:57,904 --> 00:22:00,371
- You did it.
- Let there be light.

526
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:03,636
Okay. Well, I think
that we should...

527
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:06,537
As a group, we should
go find those guys.

528
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:09,670
- I agree.
- Let's do it as a group this time.

529
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,404
No. That's
ridiculous.

530
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:13,436
If you get lost in the
woods, you're supposed...

531
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,403
to stay where you are until
someone can find you.

532
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:17,803
Fine. That's great. Let's
just sit down and breathe.

533
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:21,237
For once, I actually agree
with what you're saying.

534
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,502
You know what? You've been
giving me shit all night.

535
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,305
- I am agreeing with you.
- Guys, guys, guys.

536
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,103
I don't like any of this.

537
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:32,871
Jesus!

538
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,535
Stay.

539
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,738
Oh, my God.

540
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,105
Oh man, it's them.

541
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,069
- What the hell happened?
- Are you okay?

542
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,669
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

543
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,135
What is this?

544
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:53,899
- What's the box?
- That was at the other house.

545
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,435
I thought I saw Hugh
put it down.

546
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:57,267
Then he was running
around the corner and...

547
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:59,401
- You just took it?
- I just followed him.

548
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:01,566
- I didn't... I had it in my hand.
- Why was he running?

549
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,100
- Hugh, what happened?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

550
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:07,633
- Did you put this down?
- Amir, why the fuck did you take that?

551
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:10,432
- I thought I saw you put it down.
- I did not touch that thing.

552
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,866
I don't know what that is
or why you grabbed it.

553
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:16,232
- Guys, what happened?
- Okay. We were at the other house.

554
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,833
Hugh went around the side.
I thought I heard a noise.

555
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:21,432
You made some kind of sound, and
then you saw what? Something.

556
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,965
You won't tell me what you saw.

557
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:26,098
I don't understand what's going on.
What did you see?

558
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:27,598
- I don't...
- What did you see?

559
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,265
That has nothing to do
with anything...

560
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,865
that we should be
fucking concerned with.

561
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:31,865
What did you see?

562
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:35,897
- It's not a big deal. I'll walk it back.
- Okay, fine.

563
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,532
Wait. Let me
open it first.

564
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,432
No, Mike.
What are you doing?

565
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:42,396
- What is it?
- I don't know. I don't know.

566
00:23:42,397 --> 00:23:44,930
You don't want to talk about it
and you don't want to open...

567
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:48,062
Fine! Open the fucking box!
Open the box. What do I care?

568
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:49,930
What is wrong?
Calm down.

569
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:52,763
What happened?

570
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,432
Holy shit, it worked.

571
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:56,964
I got it.

572
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:58,495
Open it away from your face.

573
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:00,997
- It's not a bomb.
- How do you know what the heck it is?

574
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:03,667
- Don't freak out.
- Be careful.

575
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:10,028
Oh, my God, It's a ping-pong paddle.
It's a ping-pong paddle.

576
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:13,034
- Well, what's that?
- What is going on?

577
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,893
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

578
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:22,764
These are pictures of all of us.

579
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:28,028
These are...

580
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:30,526
- Somebody's marked us.
- I want to try to figure this out.

581
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,459
- This is insane.
- And there are numbers on the back.

582
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,360
- Hugh.
- Baby, what did you see?

583
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:36,193
- Hugh what did you see?
- What did you see?

584
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:37,826
Jesus Christ, man.

585
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:41,396
You can't stand there and not say anything!
What did you see?

586
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,095
Hugh!

587
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:48,627
There are pictures of us
in this box!

588
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,469
Hugh!

589
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,074

590
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:02,691
I went to the window,
and I looked in the window.

591
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:05,124
And I saw a table...

592
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:09,024
with wine glasses and candles...

593
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:14,056
and dinner set for eight people.

594
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:16,494
I saw...

595
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,023
Oh, my God.

596
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:22,124
Right.
Okay, fuck you, Hugh.

597
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,791
- I saw...
- Bullshit.

598
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:26,923
- Did you guys come and fuck with this door?
- Fuck you, Kevin.

599
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:28,138
Did you come to the side door?

600
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:30,323
No. You went to the side
door at the other house.

601
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:32,090
They wouldn't answer
the door, so I went...

602
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:33,589
Bullshit.

603
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,635
You dipshits walked in a circle
and knocked on this door.

604
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:39,408
I did not walk in a fucking circle!
I went two blocks.

605
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,623
We went up to that house.
I knocked at the door.

606
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,356
Nobody answered, so I went
and banged on the side door.

607
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:46,855
- Did you see yourself, Hugh?
- No, I did not see myself.

608
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:49,959
- No, because you weren't there.
- I did not go in a circle!

609
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:52,157
Fuck.
Just calm down.

610
00:25:53,156 --> 00:25:54,688
I don't believe this.

611
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:56,288
This still doesn't
explain the pictures.

612
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,953
What's on the back of them?

613
00:25:57,954 --> 00:25:59,954
Numbers.

614
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:05,421
They're all...
We've got two, one, one.

615
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:07,921
That's five.

616
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:10,953
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go back over there.

617
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:13,920
- Whoa.
- No, no, no. Think about it.

618
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:16,319
I'm gonna go back over there. I'm
gonna ask to use their phone...

619
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,086
and, hopefully, I can get
in touch with my brother.

620
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:19,973
And if they're not there,
I'll just leave a note. Right?

621
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:20,953
No.

622
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,352
No, no, no.
That makes sense. Right?

623
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:24,919
You should not go back. It's fine.
It'll be fine.

624
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,788
It'll be fucking fine.

625
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:31,357
What's a note going to do?

626
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:39,951
If these people have pictures
of us, they might be crazy.

627
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,350
Shit! There's someone out there.

628
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,985
There's someone out there.

629
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:45,484
- What?
- Oh, my God.

630
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,283
Oh, there's a big
guy at the door.

631
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:49,318
- Oh, my God.
- At the door?

632
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,917
What should we do?

633
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:52,518
He's walking away. He's walking away.
Please, please.

634
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,360
Baby, please be careful.
Oh, my God.

635
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,151
- Baby.
- Careful.

636
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,123
- Shit.
- What?

637
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:13,517
What is it, babe?

638
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:19,948
"Hey, there. Don't mean
to freak you guys out,

639
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:24,549
but we just wanted to borrow your
phone for five minutes tops.

640
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,126
Thanks."

641
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:36,947
Two kinds.

642
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,882
Regular Band-Aid
or cloth?

643
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,147
Whatever.

644
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:45,949
Cloth. Okay. Here we go.

645
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:49,647
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

646
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:54,980
These are ones. This is a two.
We are four, five, six.

647
00:27:54,981 --> 00:27:57,013
Do you have any red markers?

648
00:27:57,014 --> 00:28:00,615
Okay. Why are
these three ones?

649
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:04,479
- This is a six. Five.
- Hugh and Lee.

650
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,479
Two.

651
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:09,213
Four.

652
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:11,145
And that's the same picture.

653
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:13,780
Oh, my God.

654
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,283
Somebody cut that in half.

655
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,384
Where are these from?

656
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:26,209
Could this be like numerology?

657
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,911
Like if you add up
all the numbers...

658
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:30,611
in your name and the birthday...

659
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:32,743
Like life path numbers
or something like that?

660
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,276
If that's the case, then they're just
crazy and it doesn't matter anyway.

661
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:37,442
So, what do all the ones
have in common?

662
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:40,375
Um, we have Lee...
Date of birth?

663
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:42,342
- Oldest to youngest?
- There's no three?

664
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,609
- There's no three.
- There's no three.

665
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,509
Is there someone... Is there
someone that would want to be...

666
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,075
doing this to us?

667
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:53,375
Is there someone that
is on someone's bad side?

668
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,310
What?
This was taken tonight.

669
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:59,374
What?
How do you know that?

670
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,277
I bought this sweater today,
so that's from tonight.

671
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:07,910
Has anyone taken
a picture of you tonight?

672
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:11,374
Someone took a picture of you
when you were looking at the box.

673
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,174
You were looking into the lens.

674
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:15,574
But then it was
already in the box.

675
00:29:15,575 --> 00:29:18,739
What is that?

676
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,074
I can't tell what that is.

677
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:22,373
There's dots on the wall
and there's a lampshade.

678
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,053
None of the others are from tonight.
Right?

679
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,073
No. This our picture.
This is from last fall.

680
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:29,639
- This picture of Amir was taken over here.
- How do you know that?

681
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,872
- He's standing in front of this drum.
- Guys, hang on.

682
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,152
I can't figure out what this is.

683
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,039
It's taken from the door?

684
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,438
So, from behind the curtain?

685
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,973
It's taken from over there.

686
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:40,638
Wait. When someone knocked
on the door, were you there?

687
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:42,404
You were gone.

688
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,606
But you're looking
right at the camera.

689
00:29:46,604 --> 00:29:50,471
So, it would be from that door, then.
Right?

690
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:51,945
You don't remember...
I mean,

691
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:55,037
this is you, man.
This is you.

692
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,639
Guys, this isn't going
to solve anything.

693
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:00,171
What're you doing?

694
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,769
I need a drink.
I need something.

695
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,637
The... The pictures?

696
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,578
All right.
Me too.

697
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,903
It looks like
my handwriting, babe.

698
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:17,908
Look at this.

699
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:24,934
It looks like I wrote this.

700
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:26,934
Okay, relax.

701
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:29,868
You're starting to freak me out.

702
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,107
That's your handwriting.

703
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:37,472
What is going on?

704
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:43,642
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

705
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:53,032
I can't stop thinking
about the fact that you...

706
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:58,102
brought up a story
you shared with Laurie.

707
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:02,199
Of all the stories
that you could've...

708
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,332
All the experiences
that we've shared,

709
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,065
you brought up
a story about her?

710
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,366
- I am so sorry.
- In front of everyone.

711
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,199
It's a crazy story. We don't
have stories like that.

712
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,933
Oh, they're not
crazy enough for you.

713
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:15,599
Baby, it's a good thing.
Oh, God.

714
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,698
I don't need crazy stories
like that anymore.

715
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:21,466
All right. Hey, um, fuck this.
Let's just... Let's go.

716
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,265
I'm gonna go over there
and, theoretically,

717
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:25,696
let's go see if our
theoretical selves are there.

718
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:27,330
No, no, no.
I'm going.

719
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:30,730
I'm in. There's some weird
stuff happening here.

720
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,296
I think we should...

721
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:33,764
- I think we should evaluate...
- Please, can we...

722
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:35,730
- I just evaluated and I'm going.
- Can we stay here?

723
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:38,263
- If there's another me, I want to see me.
- No. No way.

724
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,997
- No, no.
- Let's go.

725
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,496
- Look.
- I'm over this.

726
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,330
I'm getting sick
of talking about it.

727
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,830
I'm getting sick
of writing about it.

728
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:47,529
- The same fucking paper, the pictures...
- Wait.

729
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,564
There's nobody
trying to hurt us.

730
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:51,695
We go find out what
the hell is going on.

731
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:54,628
What about you? You were
the one who wanted to go.

732
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:57,495
That's when I thought
they might have a phone.

733
00:31:57,496 --> 00:32:01,728
Four glowsticks. Can we
please keep two guys here?

734
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:04,128
- Two guys staying here? Please?
- I'm staying, I'm staying.

735
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,495
Are you going?
Amir, please.

736
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:08,228
Let's go.

737
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:09,861
So, what? We're
splitting up again?

738
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:11,427
No. We're not
splitting up.

739
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:14,193
We're just gonna go in two
different groups. Oh. Okay.

740
00:32:14,194 --> 00:32:15,404
Sticks, sticks, sticks.

741
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:17,794
Do we need a towel on it?

742
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,026
I'm coming.
Wait.

743
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:22,226
Chill for a second.
I'm coming.

744
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:23,752
- Why?
- Because I want to go.

745
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:25,431
I'm going with Kevin.

746
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:32,160
- Give us 20 minutes.
- All right.

747
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,659
- And then what?
- Are we taking the bat?

748
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,292
No. We'll be fine. You will be fine.
It's gonna be all right.

749
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,070
We'll find out what's going on.

750
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,212
No cars. No people.
There's nothing.

751
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,189
Guys, look.

752
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:16,393
That's my house.

753
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:20,660
Mike.
This is my house.

754
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:25,456
Mike, this isn't right.

755
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:27,921
Mike, this is not your house.

756
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,726
Mike.

757
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:33,955
- My house.
- This is not your house, Mike.

758
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:37,154
Mike.
This is not your house.

759
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:39,957
What is he doing?
Kevin.

760
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:45,656
I see... I see Lee.
Guys.

761
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:50,088
We have to go. Let's
get out of here now.

762
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,052
Mike, we need to get
the hell out of here.

763
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:53,052
Someone's coming.

764
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:56,273
Someone's coming.
Go. Just go.

765
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,220
That's just nuts.

766
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,015
So, you saw four figures,
same as you?

767
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:51,115
Except they had red glowsticks.

768
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:53,050
Who had red glowsticks?

769
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,848
They had the red glowsticks.

770
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:57,648
We had the blue glowsticks.
That was the only difference.

771
00:34:57,649 --> 00:35:00,216
So, they must've opened the red
box when the lights went out.

772
00:35:00,217 --> 00:35:02,637
And you didn't say anything to them?
Would you?

773
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,548
No, I wouldn't.

774
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:07,149
I think I would've thought I was
going to die, or something.

775
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,082
Okay, okay.
So, that's it?

776
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,015
Well, that and there's
this weird zone...

777
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:13,781
that's even darker
than the rest of it all.

778
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:16,182
We went through that.

779
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:18,014
We went through that
when we went down there.

780
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,381
We need to find out
what's going on.

781
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:22,414
- The Internet's down. We don't have...
- We can't just sit here.

782
00:35:22,415 --> 00:35:25,215
What else?
Do you guys have any...

783
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:27,081
Do you have books?

784
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:28,513
Books on what?
Books on comets?

785
00:35:28,514 --> 00:35:30,147
Comets, gravity, black holes...

786
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:33,112
Yeah, I've got Shakespeare, some
Henry Miller and some screenplays.

787
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:34,813
Dude, I'm a fucking actor.

788
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:37,113
Anything about quantum physics?

789
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:39,679
Yeah, that's right up my alley.

790
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,145
Some actors read.

791
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:45,479
Your brother left a book
at our house and...

792
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,111
What?

793
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,745
I put it in an envelope to mail,

794
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,413
but I-I put it
in your car.

795
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,444
- And it's about?
- I don't know what it's about.

796
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:54,113
- Comets?
- It's just one of his books.

797
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:55,878
It's always
about stuff like that.

798
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:58,712
Yeah, I will... I will go get
the book I don't know about.

799
00:35:58,713 --> 00:36:01,945
Can somebody go with him?
Could you bring the bat?

800
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:04,245
- Yeah.
- Yes. That's a good idea.

801
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,580
Please be careful, babe.

802
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:09,310
Okay.

803
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:11,143
Should we wake up Lee?

804
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:14,011
How could she go to sleep
in the middle of all this?

805
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:17,713
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, babe.

806
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,676
Jesus.
Calm down, everybody.

807
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:23,208
Oh, baby.

808
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:24,951
I was gonna mail it back to him.

809
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:32,542
What is it?

810
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:36,242
<i>"Gravitation: An Introduction
To Current Research."</i>

811
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:37,909
That's not gonna apply.

812
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,875
So, is his brother like
a scientist, or something?

813
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:42,375
He's just a really trippy guy.

814
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:43,842
He's really, really smart,
a real egghead.

815
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:47,408
But it's hard to... It's
like he thinks out loud.

816
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,933
He's a teacher at U.C.S.D.
What do you got, Hugh?

817
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,974
This is...

818
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:57,007
These are Brian's notes from
his lesson plan for his class.

819
00:36:57,008 --> 00:37:00,641
"Decoherence and Schrödinger's
Cat." He talked about this.

820
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:04,174
Do you guys know what Schrödinger's cat is?
I'm allergic.

821
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:07,607
So, it's a, um...
It's a thought experiment.

822
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:09,373
There's a...
There's a cat in a box...

823
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:12,372
that has, like, a 50/50
chance of living...

824
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:13,973
because there's
a vial of poison...

825
00:37:13,974 --> 00:37:15,572
that's also in the box.

826
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:19,138
So, regular physics would say
that it's one or the other.

827
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,640
That the cat is
either alive or dead.

828
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:23,472
But Brian would argue
that quantum physics says...

829
00:37:23,473 --> 00:37:26,438
that both realities
exist simultaneously.

830
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:29,972
It's only when you open the box
that they collapse...

831
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:32,072
into a single event.
Right?

832
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:35,204
So, listen to this.
This is what he's written.

833
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:36,905
"There is another theory:

834
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,971
that two states
continue to exist...

835
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:41,138
separate and decoherent
from each other,

836
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:43,769
each creating a new branch
of reality...

837
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,403
based on the two outcomes.

838
00:37:45,404 --> 00:37:48,436
Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

839
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:51,237
have no interaction
with each other."

840
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:53,503
- Hold on.
- Well, that explains it.

841
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:58,169
So we're in the box.
We're the cat.

842
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,970
We're both alive and dead.

843
00:38:00,971 --> 00:38:06,002
So, there are... There are two
separate realities, and...

844
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:08,968
presumably until
the comet passes.

845
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:11,102
- Until the comet passes?
- Okay.

846
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:15,002
Or decoherence is maintained and
those two separate realities...

847
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,969
will remain separate
once the comet passes.

848
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,469
Everybody will be fine.

849
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,469
Decoherence keeps us separate.

850
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,135
Right.

851
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:25,901
Why are the other us contacting
us then in this way?

852
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:27,434
They didn't want to.

853
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,734
Who got the pictures?
Who... The numbers?

854
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:33,335
We started it when we went
to find a house with lights.

855
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:35,867
Yeah, maybe they didn't
mean the box for us.

856
00:38:35,868 --> 00:38:38,434
The box isn't for us.

857
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:42,300
What if we've already
interacted with ourselves?

858
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:45,034
So, we're collapsing
on ourselves right now.

859
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:47,766
Not if we stay separate
from each other.

860
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,066
It's already too late.
We've already been there.

861
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:53,300
<i>Do you remember that movie
Sliding Doors?</i>

862
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:56,399
Where just a fraction
of a second...

863
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,464
there could be two realities?

864
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:01,432
In one, she runs and tries to get
on the subway and she can't.

865
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,166
She gets her hand
stuck in the door.

866
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,830
In the other one, she gets
through and there's two...

867
00:39:04,831 --> 00:39:07,299
If we're collapsing right now,
I'm gonna collapse on them.

868
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,031
I'm not gonna wait for
them to collapse on us.

869
00:39:09,032 --> 00:39:11,298
Whoa, whoa, Mike.

870
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:13,263
I'll go over there
and I'll just kill 'em.

871
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:15,996
- What?
- Half-kidding.

872
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:17,464
- Mike, let's just...
- I love my fucking life.

873
00:39:17,465 --> 00:39:19,997
Let's be smart first before
we do anything stupid,

874
00:39:19,998 --> 00:39:21,498
and let's stick
with that we do know.

875
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:24,396
And what's smart? Just sitting here?
Doing nothing?

876
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,798
What we do know is that
we took this box. Right?

877
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:29,295
So, our first act should
be to return it. Yes?

878
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:31,262
Fuck that. No. We're not
returning that box.

879
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,197
I don't trust that house.
That stays here.

880
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:35,396
Wait, wait, wait. What's
got you so freaked out?

881
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:38,129
- Stupid, stupid question.
- You're right.

882
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,463
We're not at war with the
house down the street.

883
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:43,695
They might literally
be the same people as us.

884
00:39:43,696 --> 00:39:45,534
Mike's saying come over
here and let's kill us.

885
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:50,694
That's right. If you do it first,
you know who you're gonna fight?

886
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:52,195
Mike.
You.

887
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:53,698
You're gonna run into you.

888
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:56,801
Who's gonna win that?

889
00:39:58,386 --> 00:40:00,962
Who did you see in the window
when you went there?

890
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,861
- Did you see yourself?
- I did not see myself.

891
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:04,427
- I told you who I saw.
- Okay, okay.

892
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:09,094
But what if, in that over there,
that house, what if I'm drinking?

893
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:11,145
I mean, just think
about that for a sec.

894
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,959
That's a fucked-up Michael.

895
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,160
Oh, God.

896
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:19,959
I'm not gonna wait
for a fucking drunk Mike...

897
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,458
to come over here and kill me.

898
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:24,196
And kill you and kill
you and kill you.

899
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:28,993
I'm not waiting for that.

900
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,426
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

901
00:40:32,427 --> 00:40:34,358
Who did you see
when you were there?

902
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,892
I saw Amir, I saw Hugh,
and I saw Lee.

903
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,758
Okay. Lee's
not here right now.

904
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:44,025
- She's taking a nap.
- What do you mean, she's taking a nap?

905
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:46,957
So, it's different, then. Something's off.
It's not the same.

906
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,457
In this reality, Lee's napping.

907
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,256
Maybe in that reality,
you're napping?

908
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:52,757
So, that's why Mike
didn't see her.

909
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:56,292
Right, and if Beth is
napping in that reality...

910
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,924
they don't have the book.

911
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:00,456
- They don't.
- Right.

912
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,124
The other house
doesn't have the book.

913
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,689
And if they don't have the book,

914
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,455
they're not having this
conversation right now.

915
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:10,189
So, then if we get
the book from the car...

916
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,390
then we can avoid all this.

917
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,022
Take it?
Take their book?

918
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:16,258
It's a possibility.

919
00:41:16,968 --> 00:41:19,755
Hugh, give me your keys. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

920
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:22,261
We're not supposed to mess with any of this.

921
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:24,055
Why would we even risk this?

922
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:26,554
He's talking about going over and
fighting them. But why make it worse?

923
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:28,854
Because then I don't have to
go over there and kill them.

924
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:30,388
Just give me the keys.

925
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:33,521
No. I don't think that
we should do anything.

926
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:35,730
And you are not taking my keys.

927
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:44,956
Where you going, Mike?

928
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:47,253
How do we know it's exactly us?

929
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:50,720
What if it's just externals?
What if...

930
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:52,387
- The dark side of us.
- Yeah.

931
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:55,819
It's us, you guys. You mean,
the not friendly versions?

932
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,986
Well, if it's us, then this
could be... Is it a good thing?

933
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:02,285
It sounds like it would
be a way to reach...

934
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,984
higher consciousness,
if we want to...

935
00:42:03,985 --> 00:42:05,818
Like an acceptance of ourselves?

936
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:08,885
Well, yeah. We always talk about meeting
ourselves and finding ourselves,

937
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:10,352
and here we have
an opportunity...

938
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:12,952
to actually physically
find ourselves.

939
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:14,484
That's a lot of pressure.

940
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:17,251
- Look who's joined us.
- Hi, everybody.

941
00:42:17,252 --> 00:42:19,383
How are you, honey?
Okay.

942
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:21,084
Welcome back to your
own dinner party.

943
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:23,251
Yeah. How's
my dinner party going?

944
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:25,918
Super missed you.
It's going.

945
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,918
I have an idea.

946
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,483
I have an idea
that will prevent them...

947
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:31,484
from getting the book
from the car.

948
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:33,350
What are you talking about, man?

949
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,182
I'm gonna go to that house, and
I'm gonna blackmail myself.

950
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:38,284
I'm gonna leave a note
to keep Mike...

951
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:40,283
from having them go to the
car to get that book.

952
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:42,149
What do you mean,
a blackmail note?

953
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,850
Something I know that I
don't want revealed.

954
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:45,482
What are you talking about?

955
00:42:45,483 --> 00:42:47,049
The thing with Beth.

956
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,716
The thing with Beth?

957
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:51,048
I thought you and Hugh
worked that out years ago.

958
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:53,282
This is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

959
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:55,148
It's amazing, 'cause
it would work on me.

960
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:57,449
- Going over there...
- It's the same person.

961
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,114
We don't...
You don't know that.

962
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:00,947
This will pass.
It's brilliant.

963
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:02,681
- No. It is not brilliant.
- It's brilliant.

964
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:05,448
Dude, no. I know this
look in your eye.

965
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,648
Mike, no.

966
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:09,547
Why would he even say that?

967
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,047
Divergence. Otherwise,
it's just the same people.

968
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:12,614
What's going on?

969
00:43:12,615 --> 00:43:14,246
And if it's the same people,

970
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:16,248
then why not just
leave each other alone?

971
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:18,014
That's what I would
want me to do.

972
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,612
That might be
the best thing to do.

973
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:21,412
Right?
You doing okay?

974
00:43:21,413 --> 00:43:22,846
Yeah, yeah.

975
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:27,046
I don't know if I'm woozy from
the drops or if it's like...

976
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,879
What drops?
What drops?

977
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,179
- Um...
- Did you give her...

978
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,713
Yeah, well.
She wanted to take...

979
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:36,579
I just felt so weird before.

980
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,778
- It's this stuff I brought, this rescue remedy.
- What is it?

981
00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:45,413
It's got echinacea, golden seal,
passion flower and a little ketamine.

982
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,978
I swear to God.

983
00:43:47,979 --> 00:43:49,678
- Ketamine?
- A little ketamine?

984
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,243
- It's not like you're going to go into this...
- Beth.

985
00:43:52,244 --> 00:43:56,143
- What?
- I'm so sorry if I'm wrong here...

986
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:59,278
and I'm saying something
incredibly inappropriate.

987
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:02,076
What?

988
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:05,577
Did you put any of that
in the food?

989
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:07,876
Yes. That would explain a lot.
Lee asked me for some.

990
00:44:07,877 --> 00:44:09,510
Oh, come on, Amir.

991
00:44:09,511 --> 00:44:10,975
Are you serious?

992
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:13,509
I had to ask.

993
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,142
She asked to take some
and I gave her some.

994
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:18,442
When we did the
mushrooms years ago,

995
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:22,775
we talked about it, and I put
them in the spaghetti sauce.

996
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:24,110
That was a group decision.

997
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,376
I know we agreed,
but I had to ask because...

998
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:29,521
You think that I would just
put drugs in your food?

999
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,475
Oh, my God.

1000
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:32,343
Okay. I'll show you.

1001
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:34,407
On top of all this,
you think I'd drug you?

1002
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:37,008
I'll show you. Let's just
see how much is in there.

1003
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,775
This is the vial I brought.

1004
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:41,094
Yeah, and a quarter
of it is gone.

1005
00:44:41,276 --> 00:44:43,875
But that's... She's had
a couple of drops out of it.

1006
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:46,973
- That's it.
- This is, like, high-grade pharmaceutical...

1007
00:44:46,974 --> 00:44:49,040
It is watered down.
You can't.

1008
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,506
You opened it up
and watered it down?

1009
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:52,040
Okay, but if you took
enough of it,

1010
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,973
isn't it true that you
would have hallucinations?

1011
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:55,473
You would have to have
a massive dose.

1012
00:44:55,474 --> 00:44:57,307
You would have to take
the entire bottle.

1013
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:58,675
Okay. Fine.
But is it true?

1014
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,373
Yes. Okay. And is
it also true...

1015
00:45:02,374 --> 00:45:04,706
that one of the other
effects can be paranoia?

1016
00:45:04,707 --> 00:45:07,439
Yes, but you...

1017
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,605
Again, you would have to have all of it.
The whole bottle.

1018
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,124
The whole bottle.
And it would never...

1019
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:14,539
Even if all of us
took a bottle each,

1020
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,871
it would never create
a mass hallucination.

1021
00:45:16,872 --> 00:45:20,537
I'm not a criminal. It would be
a nice conclusion right now.

1022
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:22,638
Wouldn't this be great
if we were hallucinating?

1023
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,304
- Well, it's not the explanation.
- Fine.

1024
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:29,004
I believe you. I asked for it.
This is the bottle.

1025
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:31,138
She asked for it. I gave her some.
Okay.

1026
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:33,271
I-I did not
drug your food.

1027
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,336
- I did not drug your food.
- I...

1028
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:38,036
- Get it?
- Lay off, okay?

1029
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:40,736
I swear to God.

1030
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:41,736
Thanks.

1031
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:48,136
Hey, where'd you get this?
This is so cute.

1032
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:50,302
Oh, I got it at, Galaxy.
That thrift store.

1033
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:52,003
Oh, I love that place.

1034
00:45:52,004 --> 00:45:53,903
- That's great.
- They have such cute stuff.

1035
00:45:53,904 --> 00:45:56,502
I just...
I need a drink.

1036
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,935
Yeah.

1037
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:00,005
Okay.

1038
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:04,770
I just want to wake up
and start again, you know?

1039
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:21,635
Blue.

1040
00:46:22,634 --> 00:46:24,201
It's not even cracked.

1041
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:26,399
What are we gonna do?

1042
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,567
We have to get the fuck
out of here.

1043
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,299
Okay.

1044
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,067
- Okay. Let's take...
- Take the book.

1045
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:33,566
- Take the book.
- Do we take the box?

1046
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:36,832
- Take the box. This is what they...
- Take it.

1047
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:39,701
Hey. You okay?

1048
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,167
Where'd you go?

1049
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,964
I need a drink.

1050
00:46:44,965 --> 00:46:48,964
Hey. What...
Where'd you go?

1051
00:46:48,965 --> 00:46:50,665
I went to the house, dude.

1052
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:53,232
- I told you.
- What happened?

1053
00:46:53,233 --> 00:46:55,265
I just dropped the letter off.

1054
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:59,531
I saw the book.

1055
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:02,132
I was gonna... I was gonna
smash the window...

1056
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:04,664
and take the book.

1057
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:07,231
I didn't do that, though.
I did not do that.

1058
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:10,698
I just dropped off
the letter, and, um...

1059
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:15,795
then I was gonna wait,
to see their reaction.

1060
00:47:15,796 --> 00:47:17,663
But I fuckin' freaked out.

1061
00:47:17,664 --> 00:47:19,596
- You've been gone, like, five minutes.
- Like 45 minutes, dude.

1062
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:21,263
- No. No. You talked to me.
- Bullshit.

1063
00:47:21,264 --> 00:47:22,964
You went in the kitchen.

1064
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,263
You've been gone
for five, maybe 10 tops.

1065
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:28,432
You're fuckin' crazy.

1066
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:34,040
Oh, Mike.
Mike, don't do that.

1067
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,712
- Oh, my God.
- Mike, what was...

1068
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:47,861
Don't do this.

1069
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:50,860
Mike, please?
Why now?

1070
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:53,398
Why not now, honey?
Why not now?

1071
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:57,761
- Where are Hugh and...
- We were in the kitchen.

1072
00:47:57,762 --> 00:47:59,794
Where's...

1073
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:02,794
- Where's Hugh?
- Where's Amir?

1074
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:05,360
More importantly,
where's the box?

1075
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,159
Oh, my God.
They took the box.

1076
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,826
Mike, where did they go?

1077
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:11,727
I have no clue where they went.
You gotta be kidding.

1078
00:48:11,728 --> 00:48:13,359
You were in here.
What happened?

1079
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,960
Where's the book?
Where's the book?

1080
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,274
Why would they bring that
to the other house?

1081
00:48:19,627 --> 00:48:23,325
They said they wanted to take it back
so they could make everything right.

1082
00:48:23,326 --> 00:48:25,826
They wanted to return it, so everything
would be fine from the beginning, but...

1083
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:29,192
Why would they bring the book? It's
the one thing that we wouldn't...

1084
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:32,059
- They took everything we have.
- Wait a minute.

1085
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:34,624
We have to go get them.

1086
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,991
Wait a minute. They were the
first ones to leave, right?

1087
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:39,823
And then they... They came back.
They said they saw something.

1088
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:41,423
They've been acting weird
ever since.

1089
00:48:41,424 --> 00:48:45,892
What are you implying?
Oh, my God.

1090
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,190
- No, that's... Well, you guys left, too.
- Think about it.

1091
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:50,924
I mean, everyone...
You left, too.

1092
00:48:50,925 --> 00:48:52,656
Amir came back and got
so quiet, Come on.

1093
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:54,424
And then...
and he didn't...

1094
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:56,389
- Amir was being totally weird.
- I'll bring 'em back.

1095
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,257
- I'll see what's going on.
- Baby, you're not...

1096
00:48:58,258 --> 00:48:59,856
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'll be back.

1097
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:01,822
I'm just gonna go
bring them back...

1098
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:03,289
and find out what
the hell's going on.

1099
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,321
- No. You're not leaving.
- Baby, relax. What?

1100
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:06,955
- No.
- It's fine. I'll be back.

1101
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:10,657
I'm not gonna let you go.

1102
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:14,163
It would be fucking crazy.

1103
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:21,734
Okay. So, what
are we gonna do?

1104
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:25,288
I mean, they're out there, and I swear
to God, I'm gonna have a heart attack.

1105
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:27,121
- We've gotta do something.
- Let's have a drink.

1106
00:49:27,122 --> 00:49:28,887
We don't even know
if that was them.

1107
00:49:28,888 --> 00:49:30,720
Would you quit
saying that, please?

1108
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:32,854
No, but if it wasn't them,
then Mike is right,

1109
00:49:32,855 --> 00:49:34,386
and we can't trust
the other house.

1110
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:36,087
- We can't trust ourselves.
- That's right.

1111
00:49:36,088 --> 00:49:39,691
- Jesus.
- And our clues just left the house.

1112
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,686
No. Wait.

1113
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:49,318
The clues are still here.

1114
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,819
If they had
the pictures, then...

1115
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,253
Mike, you took that picture
of me and Kevin. Right?

1116
00:49:54,254 --> 00:49:57,218
Do you have it here?

1117
00:49:57,219 --> 00:50:00,351
I-I can't take this anymore.
I can't take it.

1118
00:50:00,352 --> 00:50:02,928
- Sweetheart...
- Can you at least go look for it?

1119
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,768
I'm gonna look
for another bottle of wine.

1120
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,819
This is so stupid.

1121
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:29,449
Should I be keeping
an eye on him?

1122
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,649
I feel like
I don't want to hover, and...

1123
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:35,718
I don't know.

1124
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:39,785
Just give it a minute,
and then...

1125
00:50:41,783 --> 00:50:43,413
go in and talk to him, I guess.

1126
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:49,715
I don't know who Mike is anymore.
Not when he drinks.

1127
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:52,415
Everything that's gone wrong with us
started when he started drinking.

1128
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,181
It's why we had
to leave L.A.

1129
00:50:54,182 --> 00:50:56,081
It's why he doesn't
have a career.

1130
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,682
He's just...
I don't know.

1131
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:00,540
Not the man I married.

1132
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,076
Hey.

1133
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:06,176
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1134
00:52:06,177 --> 00:52:07,778
How you holding up?

1135
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:11,075
All things considered,
all right.

1136
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:13,475
I totally don't believe you.

1137
00:52:13,476 --> 00:52:15,509
Yeah. Well, am I being
some... What's going on?

1138
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,309
I... Amir told me you were
gonna go to Vietnam...

1139
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,908
and Em's not going with you?

1140
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:20,908
Yeah. I...

1141
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:22,609
I gotta go for work
for, I don't know...

1142
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,042
It's four months, I think, and,

1143
00:52:25,043 --> 00:52:27,075
yeah, I want her
to come along, but...

1144
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:28,574
She'd be crazy
not to go with you.

1145
00:52:28,575 --> 00:52:29,943
Yeah. That's what I think.

1146
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:32,474
Yeah. I don't...
I don't know.

1147
00:52:32,475 --> 00:52:34,608
I mean, it's... I-I really
don't want to interfere.

1148
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,273
It doesn't seem like
any of my business,

1149
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:38,940
but I think you've
always been someone...

1150
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:42,374
who's extremely passionate about
your life and what you're doing,

1151
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:45,306
and if you have a partner that
seems to hesitate all the time,

1152
00:52:45,307 --> 00:52:49,574
with things of life, I don't know
if that's gonna make you happy.

1153
00:52:49,575 --> 00:52:52,039
Oh. She's...

1154
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,512
I mean, I love her, and...
It's just who she is.

1155
00:52:54,774 --> 00:52:57,539
- Sometimes she's a little...
- Tall?

1156
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,437
- Crazy.
- She's a little bit tall.

1157
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:04,676
I mean, do you have to stand
on your tiptoes to kiss her?

1158
00:53:04,773 --> 00:53:06,770
I...

1159
00:53:10,672 --> 00:53:12,904
Sometimes people just fit well.

1160
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:15,972
Laurie...
Like that Sharks game?

1161
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:19,136
Come on, you can't tell me
we don't fit well.

1162
00:53:19,137 --> 00:53:21,836
I had to do yoga for a week
afterwards to recover.

1163
00:53:21,837 --> 00:53:24,837
I do remember that.

1164
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:28,674
I just think that maybe...

1165
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,604
Laurie.

1166
00:53:34,605 --> 00:53:37,622
I'm sorry. I'm crossing all
kinds of boundaries with you.

1167
00:53:37,623 --> 00:53:38,477
Yeah.

1168
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:52,069
Baby?
Hi.

1169
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,501
You know, I think
you're right...

1170
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:57,805
that everything happens
for a reason.

1171
00:54:05,268 --> 00:54:08,467
Should I get the bat?

1172
00:54:08,468 --> 00:54:10,735
For you or for me?

1173
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:12,137
Could be either.

1174
00:54:15,134 --> 00:54:17,533
What are we doing here?

1175
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:22,635
If I'm losing it over there,
I'm losing it here.

1176
00:54:23,613 --> 00:54:26,033
It doesn't have to be like that.
Sure, it does.

1177
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:28,099
It's the same thing.

1178
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,600
No, it's not.

1179
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,333
How do you figure?

1180
00:54:33,334 --> 00:54:38,132
Because there's no way that anybody
over there, or... or anywhere,

1181
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:41,906
loves you as much
as I love you right here.

1182
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:51,441
I fucked up.

1183
00:55:00,432 --> 00:55:02,996
Hi.
Hey.

1184
00:55:02,997 --> 00:55:06,831
How you doing?

1185
00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:10,498
Fine.

1186
00:55:11,497 --> 00:55:14,196
Is... Is everything okay?

1187
00:55:14,197 --> 00:55:17,431
Is there something going on?

1188
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:22,729
Beth just walked up to me and...

1189
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:27,128
she didn't really say much,
but she said that she...

1190
00:55:27,129 --> 00:55:30,363
saw you and Laurie talk
in the hallway, and...

1191
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:33,162
Jesus Christ, Em.
I think we have...

1192
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,127
some more important things
to worry about right now...

1193
00:55:35,128 --> 00:55:37,433
than what Beth is saying.

1194
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:43,659
Jesus Christ.

1195
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,994
Are you kidding me? That
would be the generator.

1196
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:48,527
- Hold on.
- All right. You know what to do.

1197
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:50,395
- We have thousands of matches at home.
- Don't burn yourself.

1198
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:52,926
- Kevin, do you have matches?
- Yeah, I got some.

1199
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:55,093
Here.

1200
00:55:55,094 --> 00:55:56,726
- Hold it.
- I don't know...

1201
00:55:56,727 --> 00:55:59,060
- You want to put this on the table?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1202
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:01,259
That was right out front.

1203
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,426
- Are you kidding?
- That sounds like one of our cars.

1204
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:05,158
Like one of our cars
getting broken into.

1205
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:06,825
Look, I'm going out there.
I can't stand this.

1206
00:56:06,826 --> 00:56:09,259
- I'm gonna go see what's going on.
- Not without the rest of us.

1207
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,158
- Let's just all go.
- Fine. Then let's all go, but I'm going.

1208
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:13,891
- I'll get my coat.
- I don't think we should.

1209
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:15,530
- Let's get a flashlight.
- We'll be fine.

1210
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,625
- Here. I got one here.
- You guys lead, okay?

1211
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:19,157
- You ready?
- Okay. Here we go.

1212
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,958
- Stay close. Stay close.
- Here we go.

1213
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:23,663
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

1214
00:56:28,657 --> 00:56:29,656
That's it, right?

1215
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,391
Oh, my God.
Jesus. Look.

1216
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:40,324
- Is there anything in there?
- I don't see anything.

1217
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:42,956
Oh, my God.
Should we...

1218
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:45,056
- Should we check our cars?
- That's crazy.

1219
00:56:45,057 --> 00:56:46,623
Yeah, why doesn't everybody
check their own car.

1220
00:56:46,624 --> 00:56:48,757
- See if we find anything else.
- Let's look at our cars.

1221
00:56:48,758 --> 00:56:51,054
- Okay.
- All right. After you.

1222
00:56:51,055 --> 00:56:54,390
Is everyone nearby?

1223
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:57,456
We shouldn't spread out
too much.

1224
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,586
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

1225
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:21,153
Yeah. I just...

1226
00:57:21,154 --> 00:57:26,086
put this ring on that
you got me at the fair.

1227
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:27,455
Remember?
I know it's...

1228
00:57:28,454 --> 00:57:31,287
I know it's cheesy, but I
just wanted to have it on.

1229
00:57:31,288 --> 00:57:33,352
Cheeseball.

1230
00:57:33,353 --> 00:57:37,618
- It was a good day.
- It was a good day.

1231
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,986
Are we okay?

1232
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:43,953
- Yeah, babe.
- After that whole Laurie thing?

1233
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:46,118
Yeah.

1234
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:47,919
I don't know what the
hell she's thinking,

1235
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,952
but yeah, we're good.

1236
00:57:50,953 --> 00:57:53,825
Come here. Hey.

1237
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,351
Is everything okay
with Hugh's car?

1238
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:06,217
- What do you mean?
- Well, did they take anything?

1239
00:58:06,218 --> 00:58:09,114
You just checked on his car.
Did they take anything?

1240
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,247
Doesn't make any sense at all.

1241
00:58:40,248 --> 00:58:42,780
Do you think it's just someone
trying to intimidate us?

1242
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:44,314
Intimidate? No.
I... It's...

1243
00:58:44,315 --> 00:58:46,646
None of this...
It doesn't...

1244
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:49,880
I mean, it's like they're
looking for something, and...

1245
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:53,114
- But there's nothing in there.
- Exactly. There's nothing in there. So, why...

1246
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:54,580
They could see that
there's nothing in there.

1247
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:56,547
- We could see that there's nothing in there.
- I know.

1248
00:58:56,548 --> 00:58:59,147
Why break the window
if there's nothing there?

1249
00:58:59,148 --> 00:59:02,547
- That doesn't make any sense.
- None of this makes any sense.

1250
00:59:02,548 --> 00:59:04,079
Where were you?

1251
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,513
I went and got this ring.

1252
00:59:07,514 --> 00:59:10,716
Nice.

1253
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:13,413
All right, hold on.
Let's-Let's...

1254
00:59:13,414 --> 00:59:16,411
Let's just try and figure out...

1255
00:59:16,412 --> 00:59:22,378
why we would break into
a car... Hugh's car...

1256
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:24,646
knowing that the book
wasn't there.

1257
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:26,611
Well, we're assuming
that the book is the motive.

1258
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:29,511
What if the motive
is completely different?

1259
00:59:29,512 --> 00:59:31,444
- Did you hear something?
- What the hell is that?

1260
00:59:31,445 --> 00:59:33,210
It's outside. No, Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1261
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:36,778
- Oh, shit! There's someone coming.
- What?

1262
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:38,811
They're coming over here, guys.

1263
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:40,709
Yeah. It's Hugh.

1264
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,511
- Is it Hugh?
- Is it Hugh and Amir?

1265
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,142
Yeah, it's blue.
It's Hugh and Amir. Cool.

1266
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:47,744
- They're coming to the door.
- Are you sure?

1267
00:59:47,745 --> 00:59:50,975
- It looks like it.
- Oh, baby.

1268
00:59:50,976 --> 00:59:52,710
Are you all okay?

1269
00:59:52,711 --> 00:59:56,143
Hey, where have you been?
What happened? Okay.

1270
00:59:56,144 --> 00:59:59,408
What have you been... Why did
you take... What did you do?

1271
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:02,442
- Can you please tell us what happened?
- We went to...

1272
01:00:02,443 --> 01:00:05,408
We went to make a phone call,
and then when...

1273
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:07,375
when we looked
in the door, we saw...

1274
01:00:07,376 --> 01:00:11,607
We saw this, basically.
I, I got startled.

1275
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,075
I fell over. I hit my head.
We went back to the house to...

1276
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:16,374
Wait. You already
came back here.

1277
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:18,175
We already heard this story.

1278
01:00:18,176 --> 01:00:20,008
Why are you telling us
this story again?

1279
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:21,608
- You came back with the box.
- Wait. What?

1280
01:00:21,609 --> 01:00:23,707
Because you came back,
and after you hit your head...

1281
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:26,860
We gave him a Band-Aid
and you gave us the...

1282
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,707
But not that Band-Aid.

1283
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:32,473
- What do you mean?
- Oh, my God. I gave you a cloth Band-Aid.

1284
01:00:32,474 --> 01:00:35,839
Wait a minute. Hugh... There
was a Hugh and an Amir here?

1285
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,706
Yes. And you left
with the book.

1286
01:00:37,707 --> 01:00:40,471
You left with the pictures, and
we didn't know where you went.

1287
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:43,006
We were at a house where
everybody had red glowsticks.

1288
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:45,606
- You had red glowsticks.
- Do you understand?

1289
01:00:45,607 --> 01:00:49,605
We... We have red glow... We took
them from the other house.

1290
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:51,704
- Right.
- Look. Look.

1291
01:00:51,705 --> 01:00:54,971
Is that... Look. That box of
red glowsticks is unopened.

1292
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:58,071
Guys, if they started here,
they belong here.

1293
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,305
They're in the right house.

1294
01:01:00,306 --> 01:01:03,138
- Well, welcome back.
- Welcome back.

1295
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:05,770
- Jeez, man, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1296
01:01:05,771 --> 01:01:07,803
Sorry.

1297
01:01:07,804 --> 01:01:12,038
So, guys, what was the other Mike like?
What was he doing?

1298
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:15,439
The other Mike is...
He's worried about you.

1299
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:19,470
So, it was you guys
who left us the note.

1300
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:23,104
No, I never got out
with that note.

1301
01:01:23,105 --> 01:01:24,935
We ended up with two notes.

1302
01:01:24,936 --> 01:01:26,969
And so did we.

1303
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:28,803
Well, where's...
We have two notes.

1304
01:01:28,804 --> 01:01:32,171
One that was written here and
one that was left on the door.

1305
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,469
If you didn't, and if
the other Hugh didn't,

1306
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:39,667
then who has been
leaving the notes?

1307
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:42,968
"Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

1308
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:45,301
have no interaction
with one another."

1309
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,901
So, that one note has been
written at least four times.

1310
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:50,952
Well, how many Hugh and Amirs
are walking around out there?

1311
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:55,301
Okay, before we do anything,

1312
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:58,334
we have to figure out
how to mark our own house.

1313
01:01:58,335 --> 01:02:00,867
Just stay inside. No, no.
She's right.

1314
01:02:00,868 --> 01:02:03,367
Staying inside isn't realistic.

1315
01:02:03,368 --> 01:02:06,367
We need some kind of marker.
We got to mark this house.

1316
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:08,067
If every house is the same...

1317
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:10,200
If we put a marker
in front of the house,

1318
01:02:10,201 --> 01:02:12,232
there could be an infinite
number of houses with that mark.

1319
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:14,065
So, we have to do
something random.

1320
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:15,533
Something that can't be repeated.
Something unique.

1321
01:02:15,534 --> 01:02:17,898
Dice. Do we have dice?
We have dice?

1322
01:02:17,899 --> 01:02:21,900
- Um, Yahtzee.
- Yeah, Yahtzee.

1323
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:25,998
If we each roll a number for each
of us, that's what? That's...

1324
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:28,998
Six times six times six times six
times... That's hugely random.

1325
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:32,799
- The probability of that repeating is... tiny.
- And then what? We...

1326
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,298
But so we have to have
something visual.

1327
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:37,277
I mean, should we write
it down, put it in...

1328
01:02:37,477 --> 01:02:39,230
put it outside? Put it in an envelope?

1329
01:02:39,231 --> 01:02:40,864
We still won't know.
No, no, no, no.

1330
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:42,530
We need something to mark it.

1331
01:02:42,531 --> 01:02:45,730
Yeah. We put it in a box.

1332
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:47,797
- That's, that's...
- That's exactly what they've done.

1333
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:50,463
- They were ahead of us.
- They were making a marker for their house.

1334
01:02:50,464 --> 01:02:52,863
They made a unique mark.
Only we took it.

1335
01:02:52,864 --> 01:02:54,829
If it seems like
a good idea to us,

1336
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,330
it would seem like
a good idea to them.

1337
01:02:56,331 --> 01:02:59,596
- Do you have a box?
- Yeah. Yeah, let me look.

1338
01:02:59,597 --> 01:03:01,429
So, we need photos.

1339
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:04,363
This is so crazy.
It's par for the night.

1340
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,696
- There are a lot of pictures here.
- You can't use that picture.

1341
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:08,696
That's ridiculous.

1342
01:03:08,697 --> 01:03:11,962
- I'm the attorney for Grizzly Adams.
- Yeah, I know. This is...

1343
01:03:11,963 --> 01:03:13,795
I'm never hiring you.

1344
01:03:13,796 --> 01:03:16,795
How does this work as a box?

1345
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:18,494
I didn't even know we had it.

1346
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:21,028
It was just under
a pile of crap in the back.

1347
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:22,826
If you can...
That'll work.

1348
01:03:22,827 --> 01:03:24,563
So, tha... Tha...
That's your box?

1349
01:03:25,061 --> 01:03:28,193
- It was here all the time.
- Of course it was.

1350
01:03:28,194 --> 01:03:31,727
I'm not too happy
about cutting these pictures.

1351
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:34,260
And we only have pictures of
you and I together, babe.

1352
01:03:34,261 --> 01:03:37,827
I actually... I actually
have a photo of Kevin.

1353
01:03:37,828 --> 01:03:39,792
- I know that's strange. Um...
- What?

1354
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:42,793
No, I have my, um...

1355
01:03:42,794 --> 01:03:46,260
My checking account number is written on
the back of this old photo that I have,

1356
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:48,526
and it's just been
in my wallet forever.

1357
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:50,192
It's right here.

1358
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,825
What? You know what?
I-I'll just...

1359
01:03:52,826 --> 01:03:55,958
- I'll cut this picture that we have here.
- Just use this one. It's okay.

1360
01:03:55,959 --> 01:03:59,358
Just scratch off the number.
Cut.

1361
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,659
Great. I think we got one
of everybody except me, so...

1362
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,859
I'm glad you guys all keep a lot
of pictures of your friend, Amir.

1363
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:08,056
Well, we'll take one of you.

1364
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,858
Smile, dickhead.

1365
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:14,757
Let me see.

1366
01:04:14,758 --> 01:04:16,291
It's not exactly the same.

1367
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:19,156
It's not the same as
the one from the other box.

1368
01:04:19,157 --> 01:04:22,791
They took a picture of me in the other
house, but it's not exactly the same.

1369
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:26,091
This is what we're talking about.
That's a moment where it can be...

1370
01:04:26,092 --> 01:04:27,623
a different...
a divergent moment.

1371
01:04:27,624 --> 01:04:29,956
That's what we're gonna do
right now with these dice.

1372
01:04:29,957 --> 01:04:31,824
Wait. Since we're
the blue house,

1373
01:04:31,825 --> 01:04:33,356
shouldn't we use a blue pen?

1374
01:04:33,357 --> 01:04:35,190
- Just to make it even more...
- That makes sense.

1375
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:37,356
Yeah?
The odds go up by three.

1376
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:39,656
So, does everyone have a die?

1377
01:04:39,657 --> 01:04:41,289
- What's yours?
- Beth?

1378
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,454
All right.

1379
01:04:43,455 --> 01:04:46,556
Six.

1380
01:04:46,557 --> 01:04:48,821
Hugh?
Three.

1381
01:04:48,822 --> 01:04:51,087
Mike?
Four.

1382
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:53,055
Six.

1383
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,155
Two.

1384
01:04:56,156 --> 01:04:58,454
You guys know what a quick code is?
You know when you...

1385
01:04:58,455 --> 01:05:00,521
are going online, going
into your bank account,

1386
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,554
and when you go to your
password, it'll give you...

1387
01:05:02,555 --> 01:05:04,555
a picture to choose?

1388
01:05:04,556 --> 01:05:08,454
That's your quick code. That's called an
MFA. It's a multi-factor authenticator.

1389
01:05:08,455 --> 01:05:10,788
We do 'em. We put 'em in
whenever we build our big sites.

1390
01:05:10,988 --> 01:05:12,753
It's an icon, right?

1391
01:05:12,754 --> 01:05:15,886
- Sort of a random...
- A random object.

1392
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:17,685
Yeah. So, what if
each of these...

1393
01:05:17,686 --> 01:05:21,220
has a random object in it to sort
of serve as that quick code, right?

1394
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:23,485
Right. Right. So, we pick
something to put in there.

1395
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:27,052
You could put anything in there, right?
A candle or a book or, um...

1396
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:29,785
- The oven mitt.
- Or a ping-pong paddle.

1397
01:05:29,786 --> 01:05:32,518
Or a ping-pong paddle.
Exactly. Yeah.

1398
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:36,085
Exactly.

1399
01:05:36,086 --> 01:05:38,752
- Well, how's this? And this is random, right?
- A coaster?

1400
01:05:38,952 --> 01:05:41,017
Is anything
really random tonight?

1401
01:05:41,018 --> 01:05:42,719
If you have to leave,

1402
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,217
when you check the box,
open it up,

1403
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:46,217
you see that, you know
you're off to a good start.

1404
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:47,985
I feel better.

1405
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,617
Okay.
So we've got the box.

1406
01:05:49,618 --> 01:05:52,051
Yeah, and it only took all
night to figure it out.

1407
01:05:52,052 --> 01:05:53,651
We've marked the house.
If we stay together,

1408
01:05:53,652 --> 01:05:57,950
keep our heads up, and nobody wanders
off, we can get through this.

1409
01:05:57,951 --> 01:05:59,583
- Thanks, coach.
- Yeah.

1410
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:02,617
- You want something?
- Yeah, water. Water would be great.

1411
01:06:02,618 --> 01:06:04,782
I'm gonna get a drink.

1412
01:06:04,783 --> 01:06:07,886
I wonder how different those
numbers are from the first box?

1413
01:06:08,817 --> 01:06:10,749
Let me check.

1414
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:13,014
Where's my calculator?

1415
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:18,116
Let's see.
So, if there's eight of us...

1416
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:22,216
and it's six times six...

1417
01:06:22,217 --> 01:06:24,582
times six.

1418
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:30,215
Three different colored
glowsticks times three...

1419
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:35,981
is 5,038,848 possible variables.

1420
01:06:35,982 --> 01:06:38,821
So, that's the variable.

1421
01:06:45,813 --> 01:06:48,810
Are you okay?

1422
01:06:57,415 --> 01:06:59,478
Everything okay
with the numbers?

1423
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:01,411
Yeah.

1424
01:07:01,412 --> 01:07:06,044
D-Do you remember what number was
written on the back of your picture?

1425
01:07:06,045 --> 01:07:08,279
- Five. -
- Yeah?

1426
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,413
I found a good spot out front, just as long
as another Hugh and Amir don't come by.

1427
01:07:12,414 --> 01:07:14,944
Kevin, do you remember what number was
written on the back of your picture?

1428
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:18,611
- Six.
- Yeah?

1429
01:07:18,612 --> 01:07:21,944
- Beth?
- Three.

1430
01:07:21,945 --> 01:07:23,645
Hugh, do you remember?

1431
01:07:23,646 --> 01:07:25,066
- I was a three.
- You sure?

1432
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:29,743
Yeah. What's going on
in the kitchen?

1433
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:31,977
- Pound cake.
- Pound cake.

1434
01:07:31,978 --> 01:07:34,677
The girls are
breaking out dessert...

1435
01:07:34,678 --> 01:07:37,249
before the other house eats it.

1436
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:43,295
Hey, Mike, I need
to show you something.

1437
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:49,375
The numbers that I remember...

1438
01:07:49,376 --> 01:07:52,373
from the box that was brought
here from the other house...

1439
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,178
are these numbers.

1440
01:07:57,176 --> 01:08:00,509
But these are the numbers
that I found here...

1441
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,574
in this notepad.

1442
01:08:03,575 --> 01:08:07,141
And I just asked everyone if
they can remember their number.

1443
01:08:07,142 --> 01:08:10,342
Beth and Lee are from
this house originally,

1444
01:08:10,343 --> 01:08:13,907
because they have never left.

1445
01:08:13,908 --> 01:08:18,340
But the rest of us...
We are not from this house.

1446
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:20,840
We are visitors.

1447
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:23,344
Which means that this Lee
is not your wife.

1448
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:28,338
Are you with me?

1449
01:08:31,906 --> 01:08:34,839
Well, there's more.

1450
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,837
Because Hugh and Amir...

1451
01:08:38,173 --> 01:08:40,504
are from a third house.

1452
01:08:40,505 --> 01:08:43,973
He just showed me his phone.
It's not cracked.

1453
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:49,004
Remember that dark area
that we walked through?

1454
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:51,405
I have a feeling that whoever
walks through that...

1455
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:55,037
is like they end up in the
middle of a roulette wheel,

1456
01:08:55,038 --> 01:08:58,270
and they will just end up
somewhere by chance.

1457
01:08:58,271 --> 01:09:00,303
And whoever walks
through there...

1458
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:02,908
will not return to the house
that they just left.

1459
01:09:05,652 --> 01:09:10,070
And I think that we need to find our way
back to our house before the comet passes...

1460
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:12,402
because we... once it...
once it passes,

1461
01:09:12,403 --> 01:09:14,537
we might just be stuck
exact... here.

1462
01:09:14,538 --> 01:09:15,805
Wherever we are.

1463
01:09:17,803 --> 01:09:21,569
I don't want to be stuck here.

1464
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:23,836
If your theory is true...

1465
01:09:23,837 --> 01:09:25,602
If we walk through
the dark space,

1466
01:09:25,603 --> 01:09:27,068
and it is a roulette wheel,

1467
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:29,202
there's no way we can be sure...

1468
01:09:29,203 --> 01:09:34,134
that we would go back
to our original house.

1469
01:09:34,135 --> 01:09:36,835
I think we just stay here.

1470
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:38,150
I think we're stuck here.

1471
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:42,502
I put it out near the gate.
Should be all right.

1472
01:09:42,503 --> 01:09:45,866
If we all stay here,
we should be okay.

1473
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:47,801
Don't open it.

1474
01:09:47,802 --> 01:09:50,469
Who is that?

1475
01:09:51,468 --> 01:09:53,134
Oh.

1476
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:55,799
- What is it?
- Mike.

1477
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,100
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, jeez.

1478
01:09:59,101 --> 01:10:00,866
"Mike, my friend, What is it?

1479
01:10:00,867 --> 01:10:04,199
Beth plus book
equals Trinidad Club.

1480
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,266
Don't let it happen,
whatever it takes, buddy."

1481
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:08,533
What is this?

1482
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:10,700
It's just this note.
It's... Mike had this...

1483
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:13,865
He had this crazy idea that maybe
if he left this note out there,

1484
01:10:13,866 --> 01:10:15,299
it could stop them
getting the book.

1485
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,998
It's nothing.
It was a stupid idea.

1486
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:19,197
But our Mike didn't deliver it.
What is this?

1487
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:21,131
Just some crazy other Mike running around.
It's nothing.

1488
01:10:21,132 --> 01:10:23,364
- You know what it is? What is this?
- We talked about it.

1489
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:25,064
What is it? Really,
it's nothing.

1490
01:10:25,065 --> 01:10:27,232
- Just let it go, and...
- Then why can't you tell us?

1491
01:10:27,233 --> 01:10:28,870
Beth?

1492
01:10:33,865 --> 01:10:36,498
Mike, what is this?
Oh, shit.

1493
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:39,363
It's...

1494
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:40,963
Nothing.

1495
01:10:40,964 --> 01:10:42,929
If it's nothing,
then why does my wife...

1496
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,730
have a fucking nosebleed?

1497
01:10:44,731 --> 01:10:47,831
- Oh.
- Oh, honey. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1498
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:49,730
- Beth, what the hell is this?
- I told you.

1499
01:10:49,731 --> 01:10:51,929
- I told you this was the worst.
- What is the idea?

1500
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,195
12 years ago.
Mike and Beth.

1501
01:10:54,196 --> 01:10:56,095
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- He was gonna blackmail himself...

1502
01:10:56,096 --> 01:11:00,196
- What is this?
- so they would not get the book.

1503
01:11:00,197 --> 01:11:02,328
This is bad.
This is really bad.

1504
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:06,162
- Wait. You never told Hugh?
- It was on my to-do list.

1505
01:11:06,163 --> 01:11:08,461
We have to just get
through the night, okay?

1506
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:11,627
Let's just try. He told you.
He said he told you about it.

1507
01:11:11,628 --> 01:11:13,128
Why didn't you tell me?

1508
01:11:13,129 --> 01:11:16,928
- Because you didn't say anything about it.
- Who else knew about this?

1509
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:18,926
Who else knew about this?

1510
01:11:18,927 --> 01:11:21,460
- Lee, did you know about this?
- Yes.

1511
01:11:21,461 --> 01:11:24,461
- Kevin, did you know?
- He told us. He told you. He...

1512
01:11:24,462 --> 01:11:27,026
- Everybody knew about this.
- We thought you knew.

1513
01:11:27,027 --> 01:11:29,393
Everybody knew about
this except me?

1514
01:11:29,394 --> 01:11:34,425
Hugh, listen. It's...
It's not what it seems. It's...

1515
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:37,581
- We don't even belong here.
- You are fucking too much, man.

1516
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:41,292
- You are fucking too much.
- Listen. We're visitors here.

1517
01:11:41,293 --> 01:11:43,225
- This isn't our house.
- What are you talking about?

1518
01:11:43,226 --> 01:11:44,826
This is Lee and Beth's house.

1519
01:11:44,827 --> 01:11:48,092
You sleep with my wife, and
this is what you're telling me?

1520
01:11:48,093 --> 01:11:49,360
Check your phone.
Is your phone broken?

1521
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,690
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

1522
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:54,924
- Is your phone broken?
- What the fuck does that have to do with anything?

1523
01:11:54,925 --> 01:11:57,858
- Just do it.
- Show us.

1524
01:11:57,859 --> 01:11:59,491
No. My phone
is not broken.

1525
01:11:59,492 --> 01:12:02,224
Now what does that have to do
with you sleeping with my wife?

1526
01:12:02,225 --> 01:12:05,057
From the beginning of the
evening, your phone was broken.

1527
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:07,325
- No. Em's phone is broken.
- So is yours.

1528
01:12:07,326 --> 01:12:10,091
Your... The box. The
first box that we got,

1529
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,991
we had, like, a random item.

1530
01:12:11,992 --> 01:12:13,590
W-What w-was
your random item?

1531
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:15,624
What the fuck does this
have to do with anything?

1532
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,823
Answer him.

1533
01:12:17,824 --> 01:12:21,190
- The stapler.
- No, no, no.

1534
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:22,889
- What?
- We had an oven mitt.

1535
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,990
And ours was
a ping-pong paddle.

1536
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:27,322
- What?
- Mine was a napkin.

1537
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:29,588
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1538
01:12:29,589 --> 01:12:33,589
Hugh, that is not my Lee. That is not
your Beth, and I am not your Mike.

1539
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,522
You... You aren't mad at me.

1540
01:12:35,523 --> 01:12:38,153
W-We're in a different...
a different reality here.

1541
01:12:38,352 --> 01:12:41,290
Yeah, we're in a different reality
because the reality where I am from,

1542
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:44,054
my best friend didn't
sleep with my wife.

1543
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:46,953
Hugh, do you not understand
what I'm saying?

1544
01:12:46,954 --> 01:12:51,921
This all started tonight, and if there
are a million different realities,

1545
01:12:51,922 --> 01:12:54,620
I have slept with your wife
in every one of them.

1546
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:57,887
- You fucking...
- No, no, no.

1547
01:12:57,888 --> 01:13:00,885
Hugh! Hugh!

1548
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:04,086
Come on!

1549
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:06,152
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Settle down.

1550
01:13:06,153 --> 01:13:08,572
I'm gonna get some ice.
I'm gonna get some ice.

1551
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,887
Are you okay?

1552
01:13:13,886 --> 01:13:16,654
Sit down.

1553
01:13:17,653 --> 01:13:19,386
You okay, baby?

1554
01:13:19,387 --> 01:13:21,685
- Here, let me give you a little of this.
- Yeah, yeah.

1555
01:13:21,686 --> 01:13:25,051
Okay, I'm going to put something on it.
I'll put something on it.

1556
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:30,985
You know, I've made some... some
choices, that I'm stuck with. Um...

1557
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:34,952
I'm stuck here.

1558
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:40,016
I'm like the dead cat, right?

1559
01:13:40,017 --> 01:13:41,583
This whole night
we've been worrying...

1560
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:46,983
there's some dark version of us
out there somewhere.

1561
01:13:46,984 --> 01:13:48,687
What if we're the dark version?

1562
01:13:50,685 --> 01:13:52,683
What's that?

1563
01:13:52,751 --> 01:13:54,816
- All right.
- Goddamn it!

1564
01:13:54,817 --> 01:13:57,814
Why didn't you tell me?

1565
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:05,114
There's someone in the house.

1566
01:14:05,115 --> 01:14:07,215
Get the hell outta here!

1567
01:14:07,216 --> 01:14:10,715
- Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
- Jesus. What's going on?

1568
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,314
- Is he all right?
- Are you okay?

1569
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:15,082
- Who the fuck was that?
- Mike? Mike?

1570
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:18,048
Does anybody know what to do?

1571
01:14:18,049 --> 01:14:20,147
- Mike?
- Is he breathing?

1572
01:14:20,148 --> 01:14:23,582
- Jesus Christ!
- Laurie, it's okay.

1573
01:14:25,081 --> 01:14:27,282
- Calm down.
- Laurie, Laurie, stop.

1574
01:14:27,283 --> 01:14:30,680
Laurie, Jesus.

1575
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:33,614
- Shh.
- Kevin, shut her the fuck up.

1576
01:14:33,615 --> 01:14:35,246
It's okay, Laurie.

1577
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:37,580
Just breathe. You're all right.
You're all right.

1578
01:14:37,581 --> 01:14:40,947
Em. Em.

1579
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:42,981
Em, where are you going?

1580
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:49,211
Just calm down.
It's all right.

1581
01:14:49,212 --> 01:14:52,879
- Get off me!
- Get a rag. Get a towel. Anything.

1582
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,677
- Here, here, here, here.
- Get it off!

1583
01:14:54,678 --> 01:14:57,711
- Get it off! I can't fucking stand blood.
- Okay. It's off.

1584
01:14:57,712 --> 01:14:59,500
It'll be all right.
Just calm down.

1585
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:54,875
Get the fuck away.
Get the fuck away.

1586
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:56,980
You're scaring the shit
out of everybody.

1587
01:15:58,409 --> 01:16:02,961
Who are you? Who are
you fucking people?

1588
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:23,939
And you said... All
you guys are crazy.

1589
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:26,973
You were always fucking crazy.

1590
01:16:27,972 --> 01:16:29,539
She's bad news.

1591
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,748
It's been years we
haven't seen each other.

1592
01:17:07,437 --> 01:17:10,469
You know, Vietnamese
is a pitch-based language.

1593
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:13,970
D.H.R. Yeah.

1594
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,871
It really is
a pitch-based language.

1595
01:17:21,869 --> 01:17:24,868
- Hi.
- Hi.

1596
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:26,793
Cheers.

1597
01:17:59,766 --> 01:18:01,665
And I don't think
I'm working a lot.

1598
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:06,731
I have to work a lot, but
it's gonna be a nice balance.

1599
01:18:06,732 --> 01:18:10,798
What are you gonna do while he's working?
What are you gonna do?

1600
01:18:10,799 --> 01:18:12,598
I don't know.
Just hang out.

1601
01:18:12,599 --> 01:18:13,958
- Investigate?
- Yeah, investigate.

1602
01:18:14,099 --> 01:18:16,398
Fundraise. Get those
Vietnamese to invest in...

1603
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:20,497
- Fundraise in San Francisco.
- Invest in the Vietnamese.

1604
01:18:20,498 --> 01:18:23,463
- It's supposed to be gorgeous, though.
- This time of year.

1605
01:18:23,464 --> 01:18:25,796
My cousin lived over there
for about a year...

1606
01:18:25,797 --> 01:18:27,330
and said it was
just spectacular.

1607
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:31,730
- Have you been there before?
- No. Not Vietnam. Cambodia.

1608
01:18:31,731 --> 01:18:33,263
Cambodia was awesome.

1609
01:18:33,264 --> 01:18:34,930
Did you see Angkor Wat
when you were in Cambodia?

1610
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:36,763
- Yeah.
- Good times.

1611
01:18:39,964 --> 01:18:41,697
Great.

1612
01:18:43,363 --> 01:18:45,361
Picture this.

1613
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:47,662
- Whoa. What the hell was that?
- What was that?

1614
01:18:47,663 --> 01:18:50,229
- It was like a car window, or something.
- It sounded like glass.

1615
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,755
It sounded like a windshield.

1616
01:18:52,063 --> 01:18:53,627
That's mine.
That's mine.

1617
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,827
Should we get the, the
glowsticks to take outside?

1618
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:57,328
We're not going to a rave.

1619
01:18:57,329 --> 01:19:00,160
You want to go to a rave,
party man?

1620
01:19:00,161 --> 01:19:02,394
I don't see anybody.

1621
01:19:02,395 --> 01:19:04,327
You okay?

1622
01:19:04,328 --> 01:19:07,760
- Whose is that right there?
- Oh, for fuck's sake. Seriously?

1623
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:11,426
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, baby.

1624
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:14,728
- I just got this. I just got this.
- I'm sorry.

1625
01:19:14,729 --> 01:19:17,393
There's no structural damage.

1626
01:19:17,394 --> 01:19:19,860
- Did they take anything?
- They didn't take my fucking...

1627
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,226
- They didn't take my stereo.
- Come on.

1628
01:19:22,227 --> 01:19:25,459
Why don't we check
the rest of our cars,

1629
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,926
and see what's going on.

1630
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:28,558
- Yeah.
- Honey, where's our car?

1631
01:19:28,559 --> 01:19:30,458
- In the driveway.
- All right.

1632
01:19:30,459 --> 01:19:34,428
- Em, you good?
- Yeah. I'm right up here.

1633
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:20,056
- Hey.
- Hey.

1634
01:20:20,057 --> 01:20:22,656
What are you doing?
We... Guys, she's in here.

1635
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:24,187
We were looking for you.

1636
01:20:24,188 --> 01:20:27,789
- Oh, I was just, um, by my car.
- Oh.

1637
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:31,922
- You okay, babe?
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.

1638
01:20:31,923 --> 01:20:34,420
- You got away from us.
- I did.

1639
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:37,288
I guess worse things could
happen at a dinner party.

1640
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:39,286
I went and got the...
the ring.

1641
01:20:39,287 --> 01:20:42,786
No, I could stay here.
That's a good idea.

1642
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:45,088
What were you doing out there?

1643
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:49,087
Em. What were you doing
out there?

1644
01:20:49,088 --> 01:20:52,219
Um, the view is really beautiful
of the comet out there.

1645
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,852
- Oh.
- You came in that door?

1646
01:20:54,853 --> 01:20:57,453
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with that door?

1647
01:20:57,454 --> 01:20:59,921
That's the door to nowhere.
Don't you know?

1648
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,819
Okay. Let's go take a look.
Let's check it out.

1649
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:06,816
Everybody's sick of hearing
about the feng shui.

1650
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,985
- God, it's freezing outside.
- Come on.

1651
01:21:09,986 --> 01:21:12,651
You mentioned it.
Let's look at it.

1652
01:21:12,652 --> 01:21:14,618
How come
we never use this patio?

1653
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:16,384
Well, we never have comets.

1654
01:21:16,385 --> 01:21:19,551
Oh, my God.

1655
01:21:19,552 --> 01:21:21,351
W-What's it doing?

1656
01:21:21,352 --> 01:21:23,385
It's breaking up.

1657
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:25,652
- Is that what they do?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1658
01:21:25,653 --> 01:21:28,951
So, Em, is Katherine Meriss gonna understudy
your life while you're gone for a month?

1659
01:21:28,952 --> 01:21:30,785
Oh, no one can.
Ooh.

1660
01:21:32,517 --> 01:21:35,485
- I like that.
- Oh, come on.

1661
01:21:38,718 --> 01:21:41,149
I wish we could roast
marshmallows on that meteor.

1662
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:43,308
A long stick.

1663
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,546
Yeah?

1664
01:22:34,547 --> 01:22:36,479
- Em? You okay?
- Yeah?

1665
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,145
Yeah, I'm fine.
The toilet just got backed up.

1666
01:22:39,146 --> 01:22:41,978
You can't use that one. You
gotta use the main one, okay?

1667
01:22:41,979 --> 01:22:44,711
Okay.
I'll be right out.

1668
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:31,215
- Oh, my God.
- Em. Em.

1669
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,906
Hey. You're up.

1670
01:24:24,907 --> 01:24:28,618
I'll make some breakfast. It'll
be ready in, like, five minutes.

1671
01:24:49,571 --> 01:24:51,869
Oh, hi.
You feeling better?

1672
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,968
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1673
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:55,878
I'm gonna get dressed.
I'll be back.

1674
01:25:29,635 --> 01:25:32,834
Morning.

1675
01:25:32,835 --> 01:25:35,200
You okay, babe?

1676
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:37,966
Are you okay?

1677
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:40,469
You totally passed out
last night.

1678
01:25:42,466 --> 01:25:46,198
You were mumbling.
I put you on the couch.

1679
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:48,602
Found that in the bathroom.

1680
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,134
That's weird.
It's you calling me.

1681
01:26:01,131 --> 01:26:03,032
