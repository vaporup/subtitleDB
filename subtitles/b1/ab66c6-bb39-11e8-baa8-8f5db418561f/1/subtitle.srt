As the tribal age of darkness

00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,395
and incantation was coming to its end
with the birth of new kingdoms

5
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,420
the kingdom of Shilla, founded by
PARK Hyokkose began to annex

00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,455
nearby tribes with its military
power Auta The Leader of Moon

7

Tribe PARK Hyokkose
The First Emperor of Shilla

8
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,577
Why do you bear such hatred
to kill my people?

9
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:46,655
How can I forgive those who disgrace
my land with wicked spells

10
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,225
Your land?

11
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,189
We have resided here as long as
that Great Tree had been!

12
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,701
How dare you to claim
this land as yours?

13
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,770
I had given you a chance to
become a servant of my kingdom

14
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,307
but you've refused!

15
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,405
I'll grind your skin and
bones into ashes!

16
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:52,151
As long as this sword is here, you
will not trouble the world again!

THE LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE

18
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,372
896 A.D. - The 9th year under the
reign of Queen Chinsong of Shilla

19
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:41,560
The rebels are everywhere and our
people are crossing the border...

20
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,668
Our country is in distress

21
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,904
They say a hero is born
in troubled times

22
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,243
If you could help us to...
CHUNG Jun-ho

23
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,781
I never heard of a subject choosing
it's own monarch KIM Hyo-jin

00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,215
Do not misunderstand
KIM Hae-ri CHOI Won-seok

25
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,123
I meant people suffer because of
monarch's wrongdoing

26
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,289
Then, you must faithfully
serve Her Majesty

27
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,266
One only sees
what he wishes to see

28
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:32,343
I'm helpless to protect Shilla
alone from all the rebels

29

The Great Emperor of Shilla

30
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:43,525
please grant me the strength to defend
the 1000 year sovereignty of Shilla.

31
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,043

45
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,143
Hold your tongue.

46
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,806
You haven't even engaged in a
decent battle, General BANG.

47
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:31,021
Your Majesty, my duty is to guard you. So no chance
was ever given to me. Assistant Director LEE Jin-gu

51
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,426
How will we control the overwhelming
power of the rebels?

52
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:21,435
We have to make sure our people
do not sympathize with them

53
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:28,843
Your Majesty, we should send an envoy
to China and await for their reply.

54
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,915
I'm afraid China will attack Shilla
under the pretext of reinforcements.

55
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,913
You must abolish the aristocratic
system and find men of ability.

56
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,957
I believe your duty is in National
Defense, not in domestic affairs.

57
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,494
You should mind your own duties.

58
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,126
Quiet.

59
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,700
The country is filled with thieves and

60
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,776
the palace is filled with conspiracies
to over throw the throne.

61
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,980
Biharang!

62
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,453
Will you stay and protect
me till the end?

63
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,691
Your Majesty, I'll do my best
as your royal servant.

64
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,607
Biharang.

65
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,347
Your Majesty.

66
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,285
Jaunbie was the name?

67
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,791
Don't get caught up with
a peasant like her.

68
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,242
Master, how have you been?

69
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,609
Your wound seems severe. It
must've been a fierce battle.

70
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,185
I'll be ok. Please don't be
worried about me.

71
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,787
General!

72
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,174
Will you marry me?

73
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,420
About Biharang's girl...

74
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,586
Her father was executed
for helping the rebels.

75
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,032
Your Majesty, how can you trust a
man who refuses marriage proposals

76
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,596
from royal families for
a peasant girl?

77
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,114
I have killed too many to
save my country.

78
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,829
That is your fate.

79
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,436
If you hold on to a passing fate,
it becomes yours.

80
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:45,089
Your Majesty! The rebels have
invaded Mujinju.

81
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,257
Their force is too strong. We
must send Gen. Biharang.

82
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,459
The Capital was recently attacked
by the revolting peasants.

83
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,330
Send Gen. KIM instead to
Mujinju for the back up!

84
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,169
Your Majesty!

85
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,417
Your Majesty, the rebels have
captured Mujinju!

86
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,158
What happened to
the governor of Mujinju?

87
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,593
He was killed mercilessly.

88
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,498
Your Majesty, only Gen. Biharang
can save us from the rebels.

89
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,449
Your Majesty, losing Daeya Fortress
will put Shilla in a great danger.

90
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,785
Allow me to defend Shilla
from the rebels.

91
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,347
I've put you back out in the
battlefield, again.

92
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,620
That is my duty.

93
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,162
Already 9 years have passed.

94
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,103
If there weren't so many battles,

95
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,772
you and I could've been together.

96
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,808
Back then...

97
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,410
I needed Prime Minister Wihong to
protect the throne.

98
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,280
However,

99
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,354
the only one I ever cherished in
my heart was...

100
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,619
Your Majesty.

101
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:34,595
I heard he was concerned about you
even on his death bed.

102
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,503
Yes, he was.

103
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,050
Biharang,

104
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,625
if the battle becomes too critical,
spare yourself and return to me.

105
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,419
General!

106
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,288
It will protect you.

107
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,587
You must be strong. Love turns
into hatred when it's broken.

108
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,510
- General BANG,
- Yes, sir.

109
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:20,320
Her Majesty shows too much
affection to Gen. Biharang...

110
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,226
General has been seriously
wounded. Come with me now.

111
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,538
Don't blame me for killing you.
I'm only carrying out an order.

112
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,091
Talwi!

113
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,805
Let's get a little taste
before we kill her.

114
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,290
I must be off. Take care of
the rest thoroughly.

115
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,358
There might be an ambush.
You shouldn't go alone.

116
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,452
The sword has vanished.

117
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,283
This place gives me creeps.

118
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,190
Let's get out of here quick.

119
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,294
Jaunbie!

120
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:12,896
Jaunbie!

121
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,500
Jaunbie!

122
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,404
Jaunbie!

123
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,178
Let's split up and look for her.

124
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,678
Be careful!

125
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,317
Jaunbie!

126
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,133
Jaunbie!

127
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,806
Jaunbie!

128
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,812
Jaunbie!

129
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,070
Jaunbie!

130
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,206
- Jaunbie!
- General!

131
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,674
Jaunbie!

132
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,075
General!

133
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,280
Get off me!

134
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,853
- General! It's no use!
- Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

135
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,198
Though she wanted to be my wife...

136
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,100
she never asked me of anything.

137
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,539
And she never said anything

138
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,579
for she feared she might
hinder my future.

139
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,523
The seal set by Emperor Hyokkose
1000 years ago has been broken.

140
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:13,802
And, now the evil spirit
of Auta is free again.

141
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,301
Auta! Who is he?

142
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,802
Before the time of Shilla, there were
many tribes who shared this land.

143
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,678
Auta was a leader
of one of the tribes.

144
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:38,118
My ancestors were commissioned by
Emperor Hyokkose to guard the seal.

145
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,656
The duty was passed down
to me for thousand years.

146
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,134
And Jaunbie was to succeed me...

147
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,202
General,

148
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,970
on my way home, I saw
officers dressed in black.

149
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,211
One of them had a large
scar on his face.

150
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,380
Aren't they the Royal Guards?

151
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,870
Who dare stops us?

152
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,065
Kill them!

153
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,905
General!
