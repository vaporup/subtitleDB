1
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:05,690
Bitch!

2
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,517
You're not aware of what your
officers have done?

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,950
How dare you to treat me, the Chief
of the Royal Guards, like a soldier?

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,454
Besides, this affair is
none of your concern.

5
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:38,295
Do you mean Her Majesty
ordered Jaunbie to be killed?

6
00:00:38,598 --> 00:00:41,123
- I did not say that!
- Then, did you?

7
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:44,932
I know Jaunbie's father was a rebel.

8
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:47,802
You might fool Her Majesty
with your fake loyalty

9
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,973
but I know your dark intentions.

10
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,447
It terribly worries me that you're
in Her Majesty's good graces.

11
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:58,844
General!

12
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:46,624
Did you order Jaunbie to be killed?

13
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,160
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:51,968
One of your Royal Guards
tried to kill her.

15
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:53,531
I don't understand.

16
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:55,574
Your Majesty, you have no
connection with this incident?

17
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,211
Your anger soars to the skies.

18
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,981
- Put down your sword!
- You have or you have not?

19
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:18,691
How dare you to march in here
with a sword in your hand?

20
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:22,965
Throw away your sword!

21
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:29,869
Get her!

22
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:45,115
Close the gate!

23
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,738
That way!

24
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:23,787
Kill her!

25
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,538
Away with you.

26
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,110
So...

27
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,451
did you find out whose doing?

28
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,247
Please punish me for my disloyalty.

29
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:10,518
I could punish you for treason.

30
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:16,098
However, I could understand the
circumstances that you're under.

31
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,503
Keep your mind at ease and rise.

32
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:27,839
Your Majesty.

33
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:43,054
I've thought about you every moment.

34
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,026
Biharang.

35
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:40,645
Who are you?

36
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:42,512
Where is Biharang?

37
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:44,614
Biharang!

38
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:50,090
Guards!

39
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,126
Guards!

40
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,362
Guards!

41
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:02,973
Did you not hear me?

42
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:19,923
Your people do not change
even after 1000 years.

43
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:23,495
Trying to take away the only
thing that is left!

44
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,337
Starting with you, I'll eliminate
every living thing on this land.

45
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:12,472
The dead does not belong in a living
body! Come out of her at once!

46
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:23,513
Kill her!

47
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,632
Jaunbie...

48
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:15,806
She's no longer Jaunbie!

49
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:36,320
Talwi!

50
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:53,041
The Great Emperor of Shilla,

51
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:58,508
with this Sacred Sword, may
the evil spirit be defeated!

52
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:54,130
Biharang!

53
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:03,567
Talwi!

54
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:09,406
Talwi!

55
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:33,896
General!

56
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:47,512
Jaunbie!

57
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,650
Jaunbie!

58
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,390
- What are you doing?
- Put away your sword.

59
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,033
- General, she's the evil spirit!
- Talwi!

60
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,235
She's not Jaunbie.

61
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:06,368
If we don't kill her now, we
cannot destroy the evil spirit.

62
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,100
She's Jaunbie.

63
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:13,341
I can tell by the way
she looks at me.

64
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:15,946
- General!
- Believe me this once.

65
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,283
We don't have much time.

66
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:28,024
How can she possibly resist the
monstrous power of the evil spirit?

67
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:30,759
She's over there!

68
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,293
Talwi!

69
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:39,998
Get her!

70
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,087
Get him!

71
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,566
That deceitful peasant girl must've
approached Biharang

72
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:54,997
to get to you, Your Majesty.

73
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,701
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

74
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,044
However, since Biharang
protected her,

75
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,011
perhaps, they planned this together.

76
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:09,948
Then they are rebels! We must
order them be caught and be killed.

77
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,490
First, we must find their hideout.
What happened with Talwi?

78
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,562
He's not saying a word.

79
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:23,694
Your Majesty, since this is a critical
time, we should hold a trial.

80
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:27,367
A trial?

81
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:48,049
Why don't you talk? You shouldn't
be enduring all these sufferings.

82
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,658
It's not even your fault.

83
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:54,793
I did not fulfill my duty of
serving my general.

84
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:57,767
So, kill me.

85
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,375
Master!

86
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:56,503
Master!

87
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:04,286
I can't believe you sucked out the
poison from his wound.

88
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:27,969
It will protect you.

89
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:41,092
My promise of protecting
the 1000 year sovereignty

90
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:45,160
was a futile promise.

91
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:51,028
I couldn't even protect you...

92
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,838
Jaunbie.

93
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:03,305
General.

94
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:08,747
I've been having nightmares.

95
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,948
Do not be worried.

96
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:15,815
You'll feel better when you
get some sleep.

97
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,707
Drink.

98
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:53,690
I also hope for the safety
of Gen. Biharang.

99
00:22:55,667 --> 00:23:01,503
I greatly honor your loyalty to your
general. However,

100
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:06,539
what if

101
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,075
Jaunbie truly is the evil spirit?

102
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:17,187
What if Biharang has been
bewitched by the evil spirit?

103
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,084
What if all was a devious
plan of the evil spirit?

104
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:27,360
It could've been its evil plan to
bewitch Biharang from the beginning.

105
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:35,168
It's sad.

106
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:39,209
Who would help him
in his time of troubles?

107
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:16,446
Talwi will lead us. Hurry.

108
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:22,748
Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:43,397
She just fell asleep.

110
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:49,103
Tonight, a bloody moon that holds
the hatred of 1000 years, will rise.

111
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,944
When the darkness hides the moon,

112
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:56,215
the evil spirit will regain
its full strength.

113
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:01,455
Then, even the Sacred Sword
will be powerless.

114
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:06,562
Then what about Jaunbie?

115
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:14,498
If you could keep her away from the
moon, you might be able to save her.

116
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,269
Since her desire to be
with you is so great.

117
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:23,539
If I can't keep her away, then what
would happen to her?

118
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:26,249
She'll be nothing but an empty shell.

119
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:32,448
It would be Jaunbie outside, but
she'll be Auta inside.

120
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,797
We must sacrifice one life
to save millions.

121
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,017
Jaunbie!

122
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:47,324
I'm scared.

123
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:50,194
Jaunbie!

124
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:06,246
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

125
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:53,363
It's too late for me. You must
go and save the General.

126
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,362
He's at the lake.

127
00:27:58,003 --> 00:27:59,493
Hurry!

128
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:08,072
Let's go!

129
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:34,864
General BANG has left the palace
to kill the evil spirit.

130
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,772
- Did he bring any men with him?
- Only about 100 men.

131
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:42,302
And Her Majesty followed
him in secrecy.

132
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,760
Lead the way. I'll meet with
Biharang personally.

133
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,625
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:40,099
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!
You must fight it off!

135
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:05,387
Jaunbie!

136
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:08,125
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

137
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:10,159
Jaunbie!

138
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:40,330
General...

139
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:45,928
If I can't be who I was again,

140
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:51,438
I want you to kill me yourself.

141
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:18,565
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! You must fight!

142
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:19,961
Jaunbie!

143
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:23,532
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! Please!

144
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:29,439
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

145
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:38,713
Jaunbie!

146
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:42,151
Jaunbie!

147
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:52,031
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

148
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,804
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

149
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:03,973
Jaunbie!

150
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:20,420
Your Majesty, I'll go look first.

151
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:37,948
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

152
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,979
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

153
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:45,581
Jaunbie!

154
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,559
Jaunbie!

155
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:06,167
General...

156
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:07,736
Jaunbie!

157
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:14,009
Master! Are you ok?

158
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:17,046
It's all over.

159
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,449
The evil spirit will take over
the Kingdom of Shilla.

160
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:27,417
- General!
- Biharang!

161
00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:09,796
Here is the mighty general.

162
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,593
Where did you hide her?

163
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,932
I can defeat the evil spirit.

164
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:18,036
Just give me more time.

165
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:21,578
Draw!

166
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:29,779
I'll kill anyone

167
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,681
who gets in my way.

168
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,058
Stop!

169
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,576
General BANG! Whose order
were you following

170
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,873
when it was not I who ordered
you to shoot Biharang?

171
00:35:58,483 --> 00:35:59,575
Withdraw!

172
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,019
Biharang!

173
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:13,755
Biharang!

174
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:28,312
Your Majesty, I cannot bear to
watch this with my own eyes.

175
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:32,011
Destroying your own country for
a shallow passion.

176
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:35,350
You're no different from
a bitch in heat.

177
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:40,090
How dare you to plot treason!

178
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:45,655
General BANG!

179
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,407
This is Her Majesty. Put down
your swords.

180
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:06,815
I pity your girl. She should've died
when she was supposed to.

181
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:10,747
It was YOU!

182
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:19,288
General BANG!

183
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:44,845
What are you waiting for?
Kill them all!

184
00:39:36,968 --> 00:39:38,026
Your Majesty!

185
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:40,095
Is there any way we can destroy
the evil spirit?

186
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:45,334
It's hatred is too great
for us to bear.

187
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:48,970
So the 1000 year sovereign of
Shilla must end here?

188
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:56,774
How about the Sacred Sword?

189
00:40:57,782 --> 00:41:00,250
The one that the Great Emperor used
to seal off the evil spirit.

190
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:02,043
It no longer has any power.

191
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,948
If not the Sacred Sword...

192
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,686
Then, can I do nothing but just
watch my kingdom fall apart?

193
00:41:31,682 --> 00:41:32,740
Jaunbie.

194
00:41:54,338 --> 00:41:55,327
Jaunbie!

195
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:57,665
It's me!

196
00:41:58,609 --> 00:41:59,667
Please come back.

197
00:42:00,244 --> 00:42:01,336
Please.

198
00:42:24,735 --> 00:42:26,965
I do not know how great
your hatred is,

199
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:30,003
but I'll take the blame for all.

200
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:32,773
Let go of Jaunbi.

201
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:37,742
Take me instead! Take me!

202
00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:18,181
General!

203
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:26,354
Talwi!

204
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:29,291
Talwi! Talwi!

205
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:38,674
It is not her.

206
00:43:41,312 --> 00:43:47,182
Let her rest... in peace...

207
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,518
Talwi! Talwi!

208
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:55,617
Talwi!

209
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:07,129
If it was a sin for a queen of
one country to love a man,

210
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:12,137
then take me instead.

211
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:14,869
My people are innocent.

212
00:44:47,111 --> 00:44:49,705
Stab her heart!

213
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,441
General.

214
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:04,139
Jaunbie.

215
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:39,210
Thank you.

216
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:11,075
Biharang!

217
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:40,119
6 month after Queen Chinsong left
the throne to her nephew Yoh,

218
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:43,155
she died in The North Palace.
38 years later,

219
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,862
the thousand year old
history of Shilla came to an end.
