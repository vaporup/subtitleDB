1
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,240
Antwone. He's here.

2
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,940
That's Antwone.

3
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,580
Antwone?

4
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,040
Ohh!

5
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,250
"First call,
first call to colors."

6
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,840
"First call,
first call to colors."

7
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,330
Damn. Berkley!

8
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,870
What?

9
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,530
You've been in there
10 minutes, man.

10
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,130
Shut up.

11
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,510
Yeah, okay. You know...

12
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,600
one day, Chief s
gonna come in here...

13
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,340
and catch you taking
them Hollywood showers.

14
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,140
I should snitch on you.
Come on, move, man.

15
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,680
Get out of
my way, snitch.

16
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,280
Oh, come on.
Yeah, yeah. Ruff!

17
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,880
I got you, man.

18
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,050
Ooh!

19
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,090
Arf!

20
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,160
You better quit playing, man.

21
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,700
What's cracking, Fisher?

22
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,130
Your head,
if you don't get away from me.

23
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
Heh.
What is that on your face?

24
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,940
Keep the fuck out my face, huh?

25
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,530
Say something!

26
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,480
Say something, huh?
You're always talking!

27
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,010
I'm cool, man, I'm cool.

28
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,050
I'm cool. I'm cool, man.

29
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,590
Petty Officer Fisher, you've been accused...

30
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,060
of violating Article 128...

31
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,860
Assault on a superior
non-commissioned officer.

32
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,090
How do you plead?

33
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,670
Guilty, sir.

34
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,200
Well, in your statement,
you say your attack...

35
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,930
on Petty Officer Berkley
was provoked by a...

36
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,480
a racial slur.
Is that correct?

37
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,740
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,110
Petty Officer Berkley,
did you make...

39
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,410
any racial remarks
to Petty Officer Fisher?

40
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,450
No, sir.

41
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,450
Punk, you...

42
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,880
- Stand at attention!
- Stand at attention.

43
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,620
This is
the United States Navy, son.

44
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,490
I find you guilty.

45
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,000
They'll be a forfeiture
of $200 for 2 months.

46
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,760
You'll be restricted to
the boundaries of the ship...

47
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,200
for 45 days, and you'll
perform 45 days extra duty.

48
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,140
I'm reducing you from
ship's serviceman...

49
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,540
petty officer third class...

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,970
to ship's serviceman seaman.

51
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,600
And I'm recommending
that you be evaluated...

52
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,010
at the psychiatric clinic...

53
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,450
before our next underway period.
You're dismissed.

54
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,320
So, what happened?

55
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,320
How'd it go?

56
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,390
Same old, same old.
I got busted...

57
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,720
but now I gotta go
to the psych clinic.

58
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,810
You gotta go
to the nut house?

59
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,020
Farmer, shut up, man.

60
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,750
Give it up
to the shrink? Damn.

61
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,870
See you next week.

62
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,580
Seaman Fisher.

63
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,150
Right this way.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,120
I understand it's not
your first time here.

65
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,360
You saw Dr. Williams?

66
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,160
Nah, he saw me.

67
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,290
Heh.

68
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,800
That's your wife?

69
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,640
Yes.

70
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,940
Have a seat.

71
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,580
I understand
you like to fight.

72
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,660
It's the only way
some people learn.

73
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,920
Hmm. But you pay the price
for teaching them.

74
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,420
You want to talk about it?

75
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,560
About what?

76
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,030
Whatever's bothering you.

77
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,660
Why does something
gotta be bothering me?

78
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,930
What,
because I jumped on a white boy?

79
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,100
Something must be wrong with me?

80
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,900
"Send him to the psychiatrist.

81
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,710
Nigger try to kill his master."

82
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,110
Hmph.

83
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,680
"He must be crazy."

84
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,680
You looking for a discharge, Fisher?

85
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,750
I ain't looking for nothing.

86
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,340
That's where you're headed.

87
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,510
If I want out of the navy...

88
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,020
I'll just leave.

89
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,780
Unauthorized absence?

90
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,020
Yeah,
if that's what the navy calls it.

91
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,960
Hmm. Running away
how you handle your problems?

92
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,760
I don't have no problems.

93
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,990
Hmm. Where you from, Fisher?

94
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,870
Where'd you spend your childhood?

95
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,030
Cleveland.

96
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,270
Parents still live there?

97
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,870
I never had any parents.

98
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,070
They deceased?

99
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,710
I never ha...

100
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,480
I never had parents.

101
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,310
That would make you...

102
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,450
a medical miracle, Seaman Fisher.

103
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,610
Where you from?

104
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,450
I'm from under a rock.

105
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,090
Okay.

106
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,690
Okay, all right.

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,070
I want to see you next week.

108
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,500
I ain't coming back.

109
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,540
Why not?

110
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,070
'Cause there's nothing wrong with me.

111
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,270
I agree with you there.

112
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,110
See you next week.

113
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,670
See the receptionist on your way out.

114
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,890
Next Wednesday, 1400.

115
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,730
Whoa!

116
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,460
Walker. Phillip Walker.

117
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,000
That was the name of
the last guy who stalked me.

118
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,230
Oh, man, I'm busted.

119
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,310
Yeah, you're busted.

120
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,340
What's up? Where you been?

121
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,470
I'm on restriction.

122
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,840
- Again?
- Yeah.

123
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,380
How did you get off the ship?

124
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,920
Um, well, I just
came from the medic.

125
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,990
Why?

126
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,680
Uh, well...

127
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,220
I'm working on this
high priority paper...

128
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,350
for this commander.

129
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,790
Oh. What kind of paper?

130
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,450
Well, I'm...
I'm not at liberty...

131
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,620
to talk about it right now.

132
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,220
Oh. Well, I was gonna
invite you to a party.

133
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,560
Me?

134
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,930
Yeah, you.

135
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,870
Well, I'm on restriction.

136
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,870
Yeah, you told me.

137
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,880
Hmm. I gotta...

138
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,110
you know, get back to the ship.

139
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,270
They probably looking for me...

140
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,940
right about now,
so... you know...

141
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,080
Talk to you.

142
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,910
Damn.

143
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,690
See you when you're off restriction.

144
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,760
Yes?

145
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,270
Yeah, send him in.

146
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,000
Get your monkey hands off me, man!

147
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,110
I thought you may have forgotten...

148
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,840
your way here last week,
so I took the liberty...

149
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,580
of sending an escort team for you.

150
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,080
You may be able to make me come here...

151
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,950
but you can't make me talk.

152
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,550
Thank you.
You're dismissed.

153
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,230
You don't want to talk to me?

154
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,130
Let me lay this out for you, son.

155
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,700
This is how many cases I have, okay?

156
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,970
I don't have time to waste.

157
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,130
Now, I get 3 sessions only...

158
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,570
to make an eval...

159
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,700
and a recommendation to
your commanding officer.

160
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,780
You know he wants to throw you...

161
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,940
out of the navy, don't you?

162
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,380
Now, you can sit here,
and you can not talk...

163
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,580
to me if you want to...

164
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,310
but our sessions don't begin...

165
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,790
until you begin talking to me.

166
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,410
I got nothing to say.

167
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,050
Okay.

168
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
Then we'll sit until you do.

169
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,450
I got a whole lot of
work to catch up on.

170
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,580
We can sit here every day...

171
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,920
until the day I retire.
Doesn't matter to me.

172
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,330
It doesn't matter to me, either.

173
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,590
- All righty.
- What about the brig?

174
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,630
What about it?

175
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,260
Send me to the brig.

176
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,700
There's the brig right there.

177
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,330
Lock yourself up.

178
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,170
What do you know?
Time's up.

179
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,840
See you next week, 1400.

180
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
Want some chips?

181
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,840
Hmph.

182
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,630
What?

183
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,460
I didn't say anything.

184
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,230
I thought you said something.

185
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,500
I was just clearing my throat.

186
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,170
Okay.

187
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,280
Maybe you're coming
down with something.

188
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,010
I'm all right.

189
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,320
It's just sort of...

190
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,320
Just what?

191
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,830
Just...

192
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,090
It's just a waste of time sitting here...

193
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,860
week after week...

194
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,960
wasting time.

195
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,300
I don't want you...

196
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,490
to waste your time, Antwone.

197
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,110
So, what you want me to say?

198
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,510
It's not what I want you to say.

199
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,420
It's what you want to tell me.

200
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,320
Maybe you can start
by asking me a question.

201
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,590
I don't know.
Get things going.

202
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
I can do that.

203
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,890
You said you come from under a rock.

204
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
What did you mean by that?

205
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,870
I don't know, I...

206
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,130
It was the first thing
to come to my mind.

207
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,200
What do you think it means?

208
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,800
Well, it could mean...

209
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,740
that, uh...

210
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,940
that you feel under pressure...

211
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,910
that, uh...

212
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,640
uh, you feel a weight...

213
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,240
pressing down on you.

214
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,080
That you're in the dark,
that you're alone.

215
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,550
You said you had no parents.

216
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,150
I had parents.

217
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,420
Okay.

218
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,890
Only 3 sessions, right?

219
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
Only 3.

220
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,500
My father's name was Edward.

221
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,070
So you knew him?

222
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,510
No.

223
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,040
I didn't even know his last name.

224
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,200
You know where he is?

225
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,280
Yeah, I know where he is.

226
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,280
Joey...

227
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,710
He went to his ex-girlfriend's house.

228
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,850
They got into an argument.

229
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,980
She killed my father.

230
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,560
Where was your mother
when this happened?

231
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,750
Behind bars.

232
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,490
I see.

233
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,620
I was born in prison...

234
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,460
2 months after my
father was murdered.

235
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,730
Why was she confined,
your mother?

236
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,860
I don't know.

237
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,370
All I know is what I told you.

238
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,410
So you were turned over to the state?

239
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,140
Yeah. The state placed
me in this orphanage.

240
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,210
It was supposed to be until...

241
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,310
my mother got out to claim me, but...

242
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,480
She got out, but she never claimed me.

243
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,350
Hmm. How long were you there?

244
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,450
2 years.

245
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,580
How does that make you feel, Antwone?

246
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,920
I don't know.

247
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,830
Come on, you must have
some feelings about it.

248
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,160
You know, you...
What did it feel like?

249
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,230
Rainy days.

250
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,900
Rainy days? Okay.

251
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,370
Why is that?

252
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,080
You know, in Cleveland...

253
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,980
it rains.
Not all the time...

254
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,050
but, uh, to a kid...

255
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,310
who wants to go out and play...

256
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,550
it seems like it rains every day.

257
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,590
But, uh...

258
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,520
kids expect it to rain sometimes...

259
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,060
but... for one kid...

260
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,650
it rained too much.

261
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,470
Hmm.

262
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,130
Okay.

263
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,330
You want me to come back next week?

264
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,070
Yes, I do.

265
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,470
You ever try to find her, your mother?

266
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,210
No, sir.

267
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,850
Okay. Next week.

268
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,220
Busy day?

269
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,020
Uh, no more than usual.

270
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,120
Hmm.

271
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,960
The tomatoes are from our garden.

272
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,620
Yeah?

273
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,870
Mmm. They're so much
better than last year.

274
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,140
Heh heh.

275
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,210
I mean, I'm no green thumb or anything...

276
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,080
but... heh heh.

277
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,650
Who knows?
Maybe I'm learning.

278
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,530
These tomatoes really are good.

279
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,250
When I was 2...

280
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,450
I was placed in the Tate foster home.

281
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,960
Reverend Tate, he was
a fire-breathing preacher.

282
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,860
He had his own storefront church.

283
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,950
There was only a few members.

284
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,620
There was Ms. Tate,
cousin Nadine...

285
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,600
my foster brothers Keith...

286
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,600
Keith was half white...

287
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,970
Dwight, and me.

288
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,300
It was church 3 times on Sunday...

289
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,640
Bible study on Tuesday...

290
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,220
Y.P.W.W. Meetings on Thursday...

291
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
choir rehearsal on Friday.

292
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,050
We found out if we caught the Holy Ghost...

293
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,780
in front of Ms. Tate...

294
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,420
she'd give us vanilla wafers after church.

295
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,490
So we'd catch it every Sunday.

296
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,740
Reverend Tate...

297
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,680
he didn't like Dwight at all.

298
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,870
He said he had too much pride.

299
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,750
So he tried to beat it out of him.

300
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,840
Sometimes, he would even
try to beat him to death.

301
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,580
Did he beat you?

302
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,850
No, sir.
I think he pitied me.

303
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,060
And I liked him for it...

304
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,500
but I was ashamed of him.

305
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,370
What about Mrs. Tate?

306
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,130
What about her?

307
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,140
I don't know which one
of you no-good rotten...

308
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,040
hardheaded niggers put your
dirty hands on my walls...

309
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,750
but I bet I'll get the right one.

310
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,820
I took you in...

311
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,060
when your no-account mammies
threw you away...

312
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,830
and this is the thanks I get?

313
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,300
Tsk.

314
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,300
You ungrateful niggers.

315
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,990
Hmph.
Now I know I got the right one.

316
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,830
She used to brag about...

317
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,600
beating me unconscious.

318
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,230
Hmph.

319
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,210
She'd threaten to do it again.

320
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,940
But she never did.

321
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,990
Why do you think she never did?

322
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,520
Uh... maybe she was scared.

323
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,930
She found a new way to get me, though.

324
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,960
So you like fire, huh?

325
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,220
No, Muh-deah,
no, Muh-deah...

326
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,360
I don't like fire.

327
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,100
You...

328
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,430
stay...

329
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,200
away from things
that don't belong to you.

330
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,470
You hear me?

331
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,670
You hear me?!

332
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,150
Yes, yes, Muh-deah!

333
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,110
- You hear me?!
- Yes!

334
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,150
Dumb nigger.

335
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,860
I tried everything I could...

336
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,160
to get her to like me...

337
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,930
and nothing ever worked.

338
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,100
Were you the youngest
of the foster children?

339
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,010
No,
Dwight was the youngest.

340
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,910
I was in the middle,
and Keith was the oldest.

341
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,110
Ms. Tate, she used to
put us against each other...

342
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,310
so much,
we started hating each other.

343
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,620
But I think deep down inside...

344
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,160
we really hated ourselves.

345
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,280
What do you mean?

346
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,980
Keith was half white.

347
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,580
She would try to compare Keith...

348
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,390
to me and Dwight.

349
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,560
You know,
he had the good hair...

350
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,530
and we had the bad hair.

351
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,260
She used to say how
Keith was better than us...

352
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,000
because his father was white.

353
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,340
I wished I was Keith.

354
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,240
Mmhh.

355
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,570
But not even Keith could escape...

356
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,270
from being called a nigger.

357
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,080
She hardly used our names.

358
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,310
She said the word nigger so often...

359
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,820
called us niggers so often...

360
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,250
that we could tell...

361
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,340
who she was talking to by...

362
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,950
the way she said the word nigger.

363
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,120
What happened to Dwight and Keith?

364
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,690
Dwight is in Lucasville State Penitentiary.

365
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,730
Keith got taken back by his mother.

366
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,490
He was raped by one of her boyfriends.

367
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,660
Mmhh.

368
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,030
Did what happen to Keith happen to you?

369
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,130
Hell, no.

370
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,300
Okay.

371
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,640
Okay.
Was Mrs. Tate ever...

372
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,310
Was she ever nice to you?

373
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,320
Yeah, there were times.

374
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,050
Sometimes she would
tell her friends that...

375
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,620
we were good kids and that
she was proud of us.

376
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,820
Chummy times.

377
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,050
Chummy times?

378
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,590
Yeah. I got to where I could tell...

379
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,600
what kind of day it was gonna be...

380
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,360
by the scent in the air when I awoke.

381
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,490
How could you tell?

382
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,590
Well, if I awoke
and there was the smell...

383
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,930
of grits and eggs...

384
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,600
or water steaming off the pavement...

385
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,770
as she hosed it down...

386
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,470
I had to look out all day.

387
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,940
But... if I smelled pancakes...

388
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,170
everything was okay.

389
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,250
She make pancakes very often?

390
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,550
No, sir.

391
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,120
I can delay my next appointment...

392
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,160
if you want to talk some more.

393
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,350
No, sir.

394
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,320
Hey, Slim.

395
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,760
What?

396
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,330
You going home next leave?

397
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,460
Hell, yeah. I gotta tend to the flock.

398
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,300
Hey, when I get leave...

399
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,130
I'm gonna be like a... a vampire...

400
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,830
coming to town with his coffin.

401
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,430
Just a place to lay down,
before I get down.

402
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,950
What's that mean?

403
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,950
Man, shut up.
People trying to sleep.

404
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,420
Aw, shut your grouchy ass up. Jesus!

405
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,820
Hey, when you going home, Pork Chop?

406
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,720
When your mama quit tripping...

407
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,810
and send me my money.

408
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,790
What about you, Fish?

409
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,450
When you going home?

410
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,290
Fish?

411
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,960
Fish!

412
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,350
Last night...

413
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,920
I had a dream about Jesse.

414
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,050
Who's Jesse?

415
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,020
He was my best friend.

416
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,590
When I wasn't at home...

417
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,660
I was probably wherever
Jesse was for 3 reasons.

418
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,700
One was, being his friend...

419
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,990
he wouldn't beat me up.

420
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,900
Hey, Jesse, look!
I got 5!

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,060
And the other reasons were...
so he wouldn't beat me up.

422
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,300
I only got 3.

423
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,600
I liked him a whole lot.

424
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,610
Give me yours.

425
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,890
We used to drive
our friend Kenny crazy.

426
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,960
Let's get Kenny.

427
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,720
Kenny hung around me...

428
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,520
for the same reasons
I hung around Jesse.

429
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,100
Hey, Kenny, let me see.

430
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,790
Where's Jesse?

431
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,370
Ugh!

432
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,100
Aah! Stop, stop!
Get 'em off, get 'em off!

433
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,760
Hey, Kenny, what's wrong?

434
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,540
Hey, Kenny,
don't forget to write!

435
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,240
Hey, Kenny,
don't forget to write!

436
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,500
Ms. Tate, she hated Jesse.

437
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,740
She hated seeing us together even more.

438
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,320
But for years, she couldn't keep us apart.

439
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,250
I was so happy when she kicked me out.

440
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,380
Twonny.

441
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,330
That hoodlum nigger Jesse
call up here askin' for you.

442
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,160
Said something about y'all
going to the picture show.

443
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,860
Now, that's the devil's work...

444
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,870
and who told you you could go...

445
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,940
to the picture show, anyhow?

446
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,770
I mean, where you get
the money, nigger?

447
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,570
Did you steal it?

448
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,700
I already told you.
I've been raking lawns.

449
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,370
Well, you woulda stole it.

450
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,410
Give me the money.

451
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,210
I said gimme the money.

452
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,450
You don't know what to do
with no money nohow.

453
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,820
That's why I never
let you have none.

454
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,690
Why you always got
to make things...

455
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,990
difficult for me?

456
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
Difficult?

457
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,900
Difficult.

458
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,530
Where you learnin'
such fancy words at?

459
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,110
Fancy?
Ain't no fancy word.

460
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,300
Don't sassy me, boy.

461
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,310
No one's sassing you.

462
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,310
Don't sassy me!

463
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,640
Ain't no one sassing you!

464
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,580
Don't you...

465
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,880
I ain't gonna let you beat me no more!

466
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,920
No more!

467
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,980
Lord Jesus.

468
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,720
I want you out of my house.

469
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,550
Hmm?

470
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,720
And who you think
gonna take you in, huh?

471
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,960
Retarded nigger,
don't nobody want you.

472
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,300
Your damn mammy
didn't even want you.

473
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,770
Gimme my shoe. Hmpf!

474
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,770
Must've felt pretty good...

475
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,670
when you took that shoe from her.

476
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,740
Yeah,
I felt like I was gonna go...

477
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,540
right upside her head...

478
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,480
but I just chilled.

479
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,670
Why'd you chill?

480
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,340
I don't know.

481
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,510
Well, I'm glad you did.

482
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,610
How'd you feel?

483
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,020
I felt like I won a prize...

484
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,150
but it scared me.

485
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,850
Why?

486
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,260
It was the first time I ever felt...

487
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,420
more powerful than her.

488
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,930
It was like a surprise.

489
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,470
Whatever happened to Jesse?

490
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,000
We lost touch.
You know how it is.

491
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,300
Yeah.

492
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,070
It might be helpful
to understand the mentality...

493
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,910
of people like the Tates.

494
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,950
Here.

495
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,880
It's called
The Slave Community.

496
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,680
Why I gotta understand
somebody beatin' on me?

497
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,690
What you went through...

498
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,420
was in part the result
of the treatment...

499
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,120
that slaves received
from their masters...

500
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,690
and then passed on
to their own children...

501
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,160
generation to generation to generation...

502
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,960
right on down to the Tates.

503
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,040
Sir, that sounds like an excuse.

504
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,330
I mean, I was a kid.

505
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,270
I understand.

506
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,430
You sound like you takin' up for 'em.

507
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,560
I'm not saying what they did was right.

508
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,110
What they did was wrong.

509
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,230
We all have choices.
They made the wrong choices.

510
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,180
But this is not about them.
This is about you.

511
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,680
You were sent to me...

512
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,080
because you have an anger problem.

513
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,010
Well, you got the right to be angry.

514
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,450
But you also have to learn
to channel that anger...

515
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,950
to use it constructively.

516
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,950
Instead of gettin' into fights...

517
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,120
go to the gym.

518
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,990
Hit the bag,
lift the weights.

519
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,190
You have to use that energy
to better yourself.

520
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,930
You say you're taking
Japanese classes, right?

521
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah.

522
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,230
Okay, you're already
on the right track.

523
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,500
Can we talk about this next week?

524
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,670
3 sessions, son.
Unfortunately...

525
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,570
that's all I'm given
to make a recommendation...

526
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,740
and I'm gonna recommend...

527
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,180
that you be given a second chance.

528
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,580
That is what you want, isn't it?

529
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,150
To stay in the navy?

530
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,840
Yes, sir.

531
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,480
Okay.
Okay, stay out of trouble.

532
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,430
Antwone!

533
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,930
Antwone!

534
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,860
What's up?
How you doing?

535
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,870
I'm cool.

536
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,370
Oh.
You don't seem cool.

537
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,410
I'm all right.

538
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,410
What are you doin' in there?

539
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,600
You still workin' on that paper?

540
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,970
No, I'm finished.

541
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,480
I just went through there
for a short cut.

542
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,770
Oh. Where you goin'?

543
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,280
Nowhere.

544
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,380
I... I gotta go.

545
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,780
Cheryl, I'll talk to you later.

546
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,760
Why you always talkin'
about somebody's momma?

547
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,860
Man, we ain't talkin'
about somebody's momma.

548
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,600
We talkin' about your momma!

549
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,370
Hey, Fish!

550
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,960
Yeah, I bet you won't be fightin'

551
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,170
no more honkies on this boat.

552
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,900
Man, this ain't no boat.

553
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,500
Dis a ship.

554
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,640
"Dis a ship!"

555
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,240
Country-ass Negro,
who let you in the navy?

556
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,290
Fish!

557
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,020
What's that book you readin'?

558
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,590
Let me see the cover.

559
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,420
The Slave Community.

560
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,930
Whatcha readin' that shit for?

561
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,830
Because I want to.

562
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,460
This ain't no slave ship.

563
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,430
And these ain't no slavery days.

564
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,590
I can't tell.

565
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,500
You the only buck-dancin'
Uncle Tom on the ship.

566
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,440
You a part-time brother.

567
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,010
Yo, Grayson, man,
what...

568
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,130
Why you always talkin' shit, man?

569
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
What I do ain't got nothing
to do with you.

570
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,440
You better get
out of my face, bro.

571
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,880
Either you tryin'
to hang out with the brothers...

572
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,680
or you tryin' to hang
with the white boys, man.

573
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,840
You better sit your ass back...

574
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,510
You better make up your mind.
What you gonna do?

575
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,110
Whatcha gonna do?
Come on!

576
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,120
Stop it!

577
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,420
Let me go!
Get your hands...

578
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,760
Thank you, sir.

579
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,320
Who's next?

580
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,840
So, um, Dr. Davenport...

581
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,130
you sent him to the gym?

582
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,270
Hit the punchin' bags?

583
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,870
Ain't that what you prescribin'?

584
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,780
So, why are you here?

585
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,680
You feelin' under pressure?

586
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,750
You feel like, uh,
a rock is on top of you?

587
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,550
Come on now.
Speak the hell up.

588
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,990
You better make it snappy.

589
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,750
You only got 3 sessions comin'!

590
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,290
What are y'all lookin' at?

591
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,360
What you lookin' at?!

592
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,360
You feelin' sick?

593
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,690
You need a healin'?
You need a healin'?

594
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,430
Do you need a healin', huh?
Do you need a healin'?!

595
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,030
Some of y'all sick-ass sailors...

596
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,800
need to come back after working hours!

597
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,970
See, that's when
the good Dr. Davenport...

598
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,340
he'll be layin' his hands on you!

599
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,700
Or he may have a book in there...

600
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,900
that may have the answers
to all your problems...

601
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,840
and all your questions!
Ain't that right?!

602
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,120
Ain't that right?

603
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,890
Would you like to step into my office?

604
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,560
Are you finished?

605
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,530
I thought I was
just gettin' started.

606
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,530
Let me tell you something, son.

607
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,760
It may have slipped your mind...

608
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,530
but you are addressing a superior officer.

609
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,340
You understand me?

610
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,530
Do you understand me?!

611
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,200
Yes, sir.
I slipped up.

612
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,250
You better believe you did.

613
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,940
No, sir,
I mean I slipped up...

614
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,540
when I talked to you.

615
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,640
What?

616
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,050
3 sessions, right?

617
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,050
That's correct.

618
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,280
Can't be floutin' regulations.

619
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,290
That's correct.

620
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,880
Well, what do I do, Commander?

621
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,290
'Cause I don't know what to do.

622
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,600
I don't know what to do.

623
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,450
Tired?

624
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,090
How was your day?

625
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,470
Long.

626
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,660
Not complaining, though.

627
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,670
Well, don't wait up.

628
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,830
I got a lot of work to do.

629
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,940
I know.

630
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,580
- Good night.
- Good night.

631
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,850
Well, it's nice
to finally be off...

632
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
restriction for a change.

633
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,580
Yeah, I'm gonna be
squared away from now on.

634
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,620
Hey!

635
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,190
Y'all need somethin' from the exchange?

636
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,730
Man, what's up with you
and the exchange?

637
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,990
You spend more time there
than you do on restriction.

638
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,620
I'm just tryin' to be
a good shipmate, man.

639
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,630
I'm only kiddin' with you.

640
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,030
But bring me back some Skittles.

641
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,030
And a Snickers.

642
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,130
And some pork skins.

643
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,930
And a sandwich.
Thank you.

644
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,140
What are you doin' here, sir?

645
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,050
I was in the area and saw your ship.

646
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,910
So you just saw this big ol' ship...

647
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,280
moored alongside the pier?

648
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,620
I want to see you back in my office...

649
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,350
next Wednesday, after knockoff.

650
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,090
That is, if you want to continue.

651
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,220
I think I need to check
my calender first...

652
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,270
sir.

653
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,300
Okay.

654
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,270
Well, you let me know, okay?

655
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,840
Yes, sir.

656
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,300
Hey, Cheryl.

657
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

658
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,910
What's going on?

659
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,910
Nothing.

660
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,030
You just gettin' off work?

661
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,200
Yeah.

662
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,410
Oh.

663
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,880
You, uh...
You mad?

664
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,250
Why would I be mad?

665
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,750
I'm sorry.

666
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,620
That's cool.

667
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,030
So, you finally off restriction?

668
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,720
Yeah.

669
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,660
Yeah.

670
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,130
So you can hang out now?

671
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,790
Yeah.

672
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,770
So what about now?
I'm off.

673
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,070
Nah, I gotta...
I gotta meet somebody.

674
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,200
Well, I promised I'd meet somebody...

675
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,940
in a few minutes,
so... you know.

676
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,980
What's her name?

677
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,480
- Look, it ain't like that.
- Ok.

678
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,980
It ain't like that.

679
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,610
What about tomorrow?

680
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,920
Um, what about the day after tomorrow?

681
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,960
Say, Wednesday, after knockoff?

682
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,920
That'd be better.

683
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,620
Okay. Um...

684
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,530
meet me in the lobby
of the female barracks...

685
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,100
at 1700.

686
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,100
Okay. All right.

687
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,600
I'll meet you at 1700.

688
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,040
- All right.
- Yeah.

689
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,630
It's a date.

690
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,550
Are we done?

691
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,580
Yes, we are.

692
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,840
Can I ask you a question?

693
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,980
Sure.

694
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,850
Um...
do you think it's...

695
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,180
Do you think it's possible...

696
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,490
for somebody that had
problems all their life...

697
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,220
you know,
not to stay that way?

698
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,760
You know,
you think it's possible...

699
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,890
they can change?

700
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,470
Absolutely.
Why do you ask?

701
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,730
No reason.

702
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,990
Do you want something to drink?

703
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,070
- No, I'm good, sir.
- Okay.

704
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,540
Uh, you know, you...

705
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,910
You know, when you
kinda meet somebody...

706
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,640
you know, if you have problems...

707
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,640
it wouldn't...

708
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,410
Who is she?
What's her name?

709
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,420
What's her name?

710
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,510
Cheryl.

711
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,850
She works at the exchange.

712
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,620
That's a good thing.
Keep it navy.

713
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,090
Right?

714
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,120
So?

715
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,360
Um... so, um...

716
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,260
Have you spoken to her yet?

717
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,330
Yeah, I spoke to her,
but, um...

718
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,370
I get caught up...
tongue-tied.

719
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,370
Everybody's awkward at first.

720
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,370
Okay.

721
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,570
No, not like me.

722
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,110
No, everybody is, Antwone.
Trust me.

723
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,110
Even you?

724
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,180
Even me. Everybody.

725
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,250
So...

726
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,680
Well, we're going out tonight.

727
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,010
Good.

728
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,850
We supposed to go out
a couple of days ago...

729
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,750
but, uh, you know...

730
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,760
I just wanted to clear my head.

731
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,590
Take some time.

732
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,680
You know, talk to you first.

733
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,520
- Okay.
- Yeah.

734
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,660
So, what should I do?

735
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,790
Well, she's a nice girl?

736
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,770
- Yeah.
- Yeah, obviously you like her.

737
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,860
Mm-hmm.

738
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,370
Okay, I think you should
just go out with her.

739
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,640
I mean...

740
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,370
I tell you what.
You know, sometimes it helps...

741
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,410
just to take the anxiety
out of a future meeting...

742
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,540
to role play.

743
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,670
What's that?

744
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,120
Like, you play yourself
and I'll play Cheryl...

745
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,240
and I'll ask you some questions...

746
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,820
and we'll have a conversation...

747
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,980
and you'll see that
you'll have a good time, okay?

748
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:19,990
Yeah,
you play Cheryl.

749
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,490
Okay, now.
That's right.

750
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,120
That's right.
I'm man enough to play Cheryl.

751
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,570
Okay.
Uh, you go first.

752
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,570
Nah.

753
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,000
I'll go first.

754
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,730
So...

755
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,000
how you doing?

756
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,100
Fine.

757
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,440
Good, good.

758
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,980
So, where we gonna go?

759
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,810
Out.

760
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,250
See?

761
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,380
Uh...

762
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,750
I'm hungry. You?

763
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,760
I could eat.

764
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,620
See? That's good.
You got it.

765
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,920
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

766
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,430
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

767
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,860
I'm gonna give you
my phone number.

768
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,490
If you have any problems...

769
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,700
any questions at all,
you can call me.

770
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,740
Any time of day or night.

771
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,340
Have fun.
Give me a call, okay?

772
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,540

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,770
Okay.
You never know, son.

774
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,640
These things,
sometimes they can escalate.

775
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,680
Escalate into what?

776
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,050
My wife and I went out.
It escalated into marriage.

777
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,250
No, we not escalatin' into marriage.

778
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,820
All right, well good.
You get outta here.

779
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,690

782
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,460
Okay, see you later.

783
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,470
No escalating.

784
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,470
No escalating.

785
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,630
Okay.

786
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,070
Here you go.

787
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,080
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

788
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,140
What is this?

789
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,370
Frappuccino.

790
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,380
Frappuccino?

791
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,820
Yeah.
You like it?

792
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,720
For $6.00?

793
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,480
What do you care how much it cost?

794
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,620
All the money we're makin'.

795
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,920
That's why I joined
the navy, you know?

796
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,090
To see the world,
build a fortune.

797
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,560
I don't know what to do...

798
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,690
with all the money I got.

799
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,770
Okay, now tell me...

800
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,390
why you really joined the navy.

801
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,660
For real?

802
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,740
Yeah, for real.

803
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,710
All right, well...

804
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,940
my father's a navy man,
Vietnam vet...

805
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,070
and, uh, his boys were
gonna grow up one day...

806
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,620
and join and serve just like he did.

807
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,950
Only one little problem.
He didn't have any boys.

808
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,080
- So you...
- Mm-hmm.

809
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,630
So I, yep.

810
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,630
It's worth it, you know?

811
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,490
I mean,
even if I hated the navy...

812
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,830
which I don't...

813
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,840
it's worth it just to...

814
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,960
just to see his eyes
and the way they shine...

815
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,130
when I put on that uniform.

816
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,070
So you and him are close?

817
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,670
Yeah.
We're close.

818
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,270
Mm.

819
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,310
Mm.

820
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,780
Can't wait to go home for Thanksgiving.

821
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,250
You going home?

822
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,450
I'm gonna go home.

823
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
Mm.

824
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,690
I'm kinda hungry.
How about you?

825
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,890
I could eat.

826
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,900
What?

827
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,160
Nah...

828
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,400
Nothing.

829
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,630
What?

830
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,300
- What?
- You sure?

831
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,470
- No.
- Okay.

832
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,310
You shoulda ordered something.

833
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,510
I like what I ordered.
These are good.

834
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,180
You know, vegetables
are good for you.

835
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,180
Want to try some?

836
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,650
Come on.

837
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,660
Try it.
It's good.

838
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,490
It's got, uh,
white cabbage...

839
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,560
purple cabbage, yellow cabbage.

840
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,260
Nasty cabbage.

841
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,970
Man!

842
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,330
It's not that bad.

843
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,310
Mm-hmm.

844
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,800
So...

845
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,440
what do you like to do?

846
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,680
Or what do you want to do?

847
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,380
What would you like to do?

848
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,380
What would I like to do?

849
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,380
Mm-hmm.

850
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,110
Um...

851
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,160
like, um...
I want to teach.

852
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,230
Yeah?

853
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,520
My mother was a teacher.

854
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,060
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

855
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,160
Mm.
A teacher's, um...

856
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,900
I think that's a powerful position,
you know?

857
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,170
You get to give to kids and all that.

858
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,010
I think you'll make
an excellent teacher.

859
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,340
Really?
Thank you.

860
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,470
I think, um...

861
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,540
I think you're beautiful.

862
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,020
Thank you.

863
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,660
What?

864
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,490
Well, it's just funny.

865
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,620
I mean, nice,
what happens to your...

866
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,720
To your mouth when you smile.

867
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,860
One side curls up higher than the other.

868
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,600
Did you ever know that?

869
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,730
No.

870
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,070
It's cute.

871
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,370
Oh, thank you.

872
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,310
You shouldn't hide it, you know?

873
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,970
You should smile more often.

874
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,880
It's good for you.

875
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,880
Yeah.

876
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,380
Oh.

877
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,450
Here we are.

878
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,720
You had a good time?

879
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,660
Yeah.
I had a great time.

880
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,660
Thank you.

881
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,290
Well... good night.

882
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,560
Good night.

883
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,510
What is that?

884
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,510
Japanese.

885
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,610
That meant,
"It gave me great pleasure...

886
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,150
to spend this evening with you."

887
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,920
Cool.
That was beautiful.

888
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,360
Thank you.

889
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:55,950
So, how do they say...

890
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,220
"Maybe we can do this again sometime?"

891
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,730
Uh...

892
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,770
I don't know.

893
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,430
Nah.

894
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,760
Let me know.

895
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,840
I will.

896
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,370
Good night.

897
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,240
Good night.

898
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,540
Good night.

899
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,250
Oh, yeah,
I kissed her, man!

900
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,320
Shoot.

901
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,360
But I ain't...
I ain't gettin'

902
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,790
into all the intimate details with you.

903
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,020
For real.
That's just how it is.

904
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,860
That's my girl,
I respect her and...

905
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,800
Mind yours.
Mind yours.

906
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,130
God, that made me look like a pizza.

907
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,840
Hey.

908
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,440
Hi.

909
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,920
Ohh.

910
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,420
Whatcha doing?

911
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,690
Organizing.

912
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,200
Organizing.

913
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,790
These pile up.

914
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,700
Well...

915
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,270
you could start off
by gettin' rid of that one.

916
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,600
Make the pile a little smaller.

917
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,400
No, you're gonna have to get in line.

918
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,200
Yeah?
I remember that one.

919
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,370
You can get rid of that one, too.

920
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,410
Look it.

921
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,410
Huh.

922
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,710
Ohh...

923
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,720
a lifetime ago.

924
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,510
Not to me.

925
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,050
Let's see this.

926
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,860
What?

927
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,730
How long are we gonna do this?

928
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,070
Are you gonna just keep ignoring me?

929
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,370
Come on, baby.
Come on, now.

930
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,500
What are you talkin' about?
I mean...

931
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,940
we're just having a good time.

932
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:55,950
Why don't we...

933
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,040
You're just gonna continue to act...

934
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,240
like you don't know
what I'm talking about?

935
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,840
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

936
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:03,860
You don't know...

937
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,650
I'm hungry, you know?
I mean, I walk in...

938
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,690
Talk to me.

939
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,430
Jerome?

940
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,300
She kissed me.

941
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,870
What?
She kissed me.

942
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,310
I didn't even push her.

943
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,740
The only thing I did was
I walked her to her door...

944
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,870
I threw some Japanese on her...

945
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,410
and then she kissed me.

946
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,500
Listen, Seaman Fisher...

947
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,340
Oh, sir,
I'm sorry for knockin' on your door...

948
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,040
but I had to.
I had to talk to you.

949
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,120
Hello.

950
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,380
I'm sorry for bustin' in
on you like this.

951
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,610
You know,
this is highly irregular.

952
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,990
Yes, sir, I know.
But what am I gonna do?

953
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,560
I mean, we get underway
to Mexico next week...

954
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,750
and I'm startin' to get
serious with this girl.

955
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,760
Okay, okay.

956
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,760
Well, she'll be here
when you get back.

957
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,660
How do you know?
Maybe she won't.

958
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,390
Because if she has a fraction
of the bounce that you have...

959
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,160
she'll be here,
I guarantee you.

960
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,570
So you think I should just chill?

961
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:52,570
That would be a good suggestion.

962
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,400
- Chill. Yes.
- Okay.

963
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,730
I won't be doing this again.

964
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,930
Thank you very much.
Good night.

965
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,030
Thank you, sir.

966
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,510
You're welcome.

967
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,980
Who was that?

968
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,580
A patient of mine.

969
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,450
He was, uh...
on his first date.

970
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,460
He was so excited.

971
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,590
He couldn't wait to tell me about it.

972
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,500
Well, don't cure him.

973
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,710
Yeah!

974
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,680
Show me what you're working with!

975
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,120
Show me what you're
working with, whoo!

976
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,880
Hey!

977
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,250
All right, man! Fish!

978
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,780
I don't know about you,
but if my math is right...

979
00:49:58,890 --> 00:49:59,980
we a lady short at this table.

980
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,080
Oh, you ain't know?

981
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,530
My man Fish says
he got himself a girlfriend.

982
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,620
She's in the navy.
Right, Fish?

983
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,460
Yeah, be writin' to her
every minute he can find.

984
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,970
Just so romantic.

985
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,840
Quieres bailar?

986
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,840
I don't understand.

987
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,500
Oh, you understand.

988
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,630
Quieres bailar?
Si. Si, bailar.

989
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,680
I don't know...

990
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,680
She wants to mate.

991
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,710
Do the dance.
You understand.

992
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,040
Come, come!

993
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,170
Venga, venga.

994
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,380
No, I'm fine.

995
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,610
Let her oil the old slave down.

996
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,210
What your girlfriend don't know...

997
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,950
won't hurt you.

998
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,220
Hey, come on, man.
Get up, get up, get up.

999
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,620
No, I don't want to.

1000
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,750
You don't what?

1001
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,650
You should leave him alone, Grayson.

1002
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,060
I'm not botherin' him.

1003
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,220
But he didn't answer my question.

1004
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,320
What question?

1005
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,490
You don't what?

1006
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,370
How come I never seen you
with a girl, huh?

1007
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,810
I mean, man says he's got
a girlfriend, right?

1008
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,930
Well, anybody ever met her?

1009
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,170
Huh?

1010
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,580
Anybody?

1011
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,810
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

1012
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,350
You see,
he's a cherry boy.

1013
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,580
Never been to the sugar shack.

1014
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,590
Too scared to go.

1015
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,090
Fuck you, Grayson.

1016
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,820
Huh?
What did you say?

1017
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:09,830
You heard me.

1018
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,560
Fuck me?

1019
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,650
With all these women in here?

1020
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,760
You want me?

1021
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,730
See what I mean, brothers?

1022
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,100
Hell, I'm worried about you, Fish.

1023
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,110
I mean, all this action up in here.

1024
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,230
Why you don't want no woman?

1025
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,880
Yeah. Faggot.

1026
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,120
Here we go again.

1027
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:47,860
Davenport.

1028
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,540
What time does his plane get in?

1029
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,150
Okay.
No, no, I understand.

1030
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,010
I understand.

1031
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,180
Okay, just let me talk to him first.

1032
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,090
All right, thank you.

1033
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,620
I thought we were
all done fightin', Antwone.

1034
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,160
Let me in.

1035
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,800
The X.O. Wired the statements
of your shipmates.

1036
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,400
Now, do you wanna start
at the beginning?

1037
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,920
Look, you're gonna
have to talk to me, son.

1038
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,910
You better tell me something...

1039
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,860
'cause I'm all you got right now.

1040
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,050
Now,
I'm tryin' to work things out...

1041
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,060
with your commanding officer...

1042
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,290
but you gotta give me something.

1043
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,390
I don't know what to say.

1044
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,560
So tell me what happened.

1045
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,160
They were frontin' me.

1046
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,360
What do you mean,
frontin' you?

1047
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,340
Some of the guys
were baggin' on me.

1048
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,500
I couldn't take it.

1049
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,970
How so?

1050
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,940
I don't know.

1051
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,450
Just, uh...

1052
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,280
just makin'... makin' jokes.

1053
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,290
What kind of jokes?

1054
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,080
Jokes about me with...

1055
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,030
With women.

1056
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,560
I wasn't takin' it.

1057
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,130
What kind of jokes about
you bein' with women, Antwone?

1058
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,130
Jokes like me bein' a virgin.

1059
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,730
Are you?

1060
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,910
I don't know.

1061
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,670
I might be.

1062
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,080
Okay.

1063
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,050
Why do you think you
haven't been with a woman?

1064
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,130
Think about it, son.

1065
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,390
Must be a reason.
I mean, you're a...

1066
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,400
good-lookin' young man.

1067
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,900
Must've had many opportunities.

1068
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,700
Maybe you don't like women.
Maybe you like men.

1069
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,800
I like women.

1070
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:44,930
Maybe you don't care about sex.

1071
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,010
I care about sex.

1072
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,940
I think about it all the time.

1073
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,520
All right. We're right
back where we started.

1074
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,580
How come you've never
been with a woman?

1075
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:58,750
I have.

1076
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,120
Okay.

1077
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,060
When?

1078
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,900
When?

1079
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,260
When I was young.
There was...

1080
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,960
There was a kiss.

1081
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,660
Okay.

1082
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,760
How was it?

1083
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,970
I hated it.

1084
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:17,970
It was t...

1085
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,070
It was terrible.

1086
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,770
Why?

1087
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,010
I threw up.

1088
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:26,450
Why?

1089
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,420
Why?

1090
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,920
Because...

1091
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,520
because she put her tongue in my mouth.

1092
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,100
She... she always did.

1093
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,260
That's my mama.

1094
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,270
That ain't your mama!

1095
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,960
You said the other lady was yours!

1096
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,230
I changed!

1097
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,900
What?
You can't change!

1098
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,170
That's my mama!

1099
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,800
Nigger?

1100
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,940
Nigger, you hear me callin' you?

1101
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,170
I said nigger.

1102
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,180
Comin', Muh-deah!

1103
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,770
Dwight! Keith!

1104
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,850
Yes, Muh-deah.
Here... here I come.

1105
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,510
Get your behinds down here.

1106
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,890
And I told y'all not
to mess up your clothes!

1107
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,590
And I told y'all not
to mess up your clothes!

1108
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,220
- Nadine?
- Yes?

1109
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,420
We're gonna be downtown...

1110
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,790
at the social service office.

1111
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,490
All right.

1112
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,730
Twonny? You stay with Nadine.

1113
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,830
Yes, Muh-deah.

1114
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,000
Twonny.

1115
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,800
What you lookin' at out there?

1116
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,180
Hmm?

1117
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,980
What you lookin' at?

1118
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,620
That's it.

1119
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,230
Gimme some sugar.

1120
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,380
Now get on downstairs.

1121
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,020
What did I say?

1122
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,180
Get on downstairs.

1123
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,120
In that basement and drop 'em.

1124
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,770
Hurry up.

1125
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,310
Now, unbutton 'em all.

1126
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,310
Come on.

1127
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:06,880
I said, come on!

1128
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:11,040
Now, pull 'em down.

1129
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,120
You heard me, pull 'em down.

1130
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,950
Pull 'em right over my feet.

1131
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,240
Now get over here closer.

1132
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,760
Closer.
You don't have to be afraid.

1133
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,760
Now touch me.

1134
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,420
You know you wanna.

1135
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,730
Yeah, that's it. Kiss me.

1136
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,270
Come on, now. I said kiss me.

1137
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,300
Baby, gimme some sugar.

1138
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,430
Antwone!

1139
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,380
Ooh! I'm gonna tell on you!

1140
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,730
What's up, man?
You all right?

1141
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,030
Come on in.

1142
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,050
You all right?

1143
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,650
She did it again.

1144
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,420
She hit you, too?

1145
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,730
It's okay, Antwone.

1146
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,200
You could stay here.

1147
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,790
I'll look after you.

1148
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,460
Come on. Let's get you a shirt.

1149
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,110
She made me...

1150
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,410
She made me do these things.

1151
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,720
And I was only a little boy.

1152
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,290
If there was something
that I wouldn't do...

1153
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,160
she would beat me.

1154
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,060
And Jesse was the only one
you ever told?

1155
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,100
Yes, sir.

1156
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,770
She's the only woman
I ever seen naked.

1157
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:19,470
I'm almost 25 years old.

1158
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,250
I never done it.

1159
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,780
That's embarrassing.

1160
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,020
I hate it.

1161
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,740
Yes,
can I help you with something?

1162
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,050
Hello, Ms. Davenport.

1163
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,380
I'm Seaman Fisher.

1164
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,080
Antwone Fisher, ma'am.

1165
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,160
Well, what can I do for you?

1166
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,520
I'm here to see the commander.

1167
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,390
I'm one of his patients.
He told me to meet him here.

1168
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,890
Well, he's not home yet.

1169
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,550
But...

1170
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,490
um...

1171
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,260
Well, come on inside.
You can wait.

1172
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,570
Would you like some cider?

1173
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,940
Sure. Thank you.

1174
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:30,640
Seems you gettin' all ready
for Thanksgiving, ma'am.

1175
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:31,840
Don't call me ma'am.

1176
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:32,920
You're gonna make me feel old.

1177
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,710
Call me Berta.

1178
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,910
So, are you going home
for the holidays?

1179
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,650
No,
but the chief cook on the ship...

1180
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,810
he's plannin' a big meal.

1181
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,860
So I'll be there for that.

1182
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,690
That sounds nice.

1183
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:43,920
Here you go.

1184
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:46,190
Thank you. Very much.

1185
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,530
Um...

1186
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:48,720
first thing I saw...

1187
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,770
first time I was in his office...

1188
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,560
it was you.

1189
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,700
Yeah. It was your picture.

1190
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,170
I thought you
had a nice face...

1191
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,570
a good face, and...
maybe he's all right...

1192
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,970
if he married a woman like you.

1193
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,170
You ready to get started?

1194
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,880
Yes, sir.

1195
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,040
Nice meetin' you.

1196
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:11,710
It was very nice to meet you, too.

1197
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,850
Okay.

1198
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,890
I was just tryin' to be nice.

1199
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,800
Why don't you try bein'
nice on that ship?

1200
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,630
Hmm?

1201
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:25,860
Have a seat.

1202
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,210
I like your house.

1203
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,640
Thank you.

1204
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,540
Tell me about your house.

1205
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,480
Your house the day
you left your family.

1206
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,480
Sir?

1207
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,950
The Tates.
When they threw you out.

1208
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:39,950
Tell me about that.

1209
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,850
Oh.
It was back to the orphanage.

1210
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,390
Um...

1211
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:45,820
they, uh... they told me I needed...

1212
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,520
to develop my social skills.

1213
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:53,560
Nobody was into adoptin' teenage boys.

1214
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,500
Uh...

1215
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,830
they sent me to a reform school...

1216
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,490
in Pennsylvania.

1217
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,830
That's where I got
my excellent skills I have now.

1218
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,570
Hmm...

1219
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,610
What then?

1220
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:06,540
Um... I was on my own.

1221
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,840
The social worker,
she took me to a...

1222
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,070
A men's shelter.

1223
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,710
She gave me $67...

1224
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,410
and, uh...

1225
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,850
she said good-bye.

1226
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,920
How long were you at the shelter?

1227
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,290
Just till the next mornin'.

1228
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,320
And?

1229
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,260
I slept on a few park benches...

1230
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,620
and I came here.

1231
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,130
To my house?

1232
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,600
No, sir.

1233
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,930
I joined the navy.

1234
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,000
That's it.

1235
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,270
I mean,
that's the Antwone Fisher story.

1236
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,440
Okay.

1237
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,440
That is it.

1238
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,450
You're done for today.

1239
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:44,640
Okay, sir.

1240
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,340
Don't talk to my wife anymore either.
You hear me?

1241
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,910
Yes, sir.

1242
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:49,850
All right.

1243
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:05,670
Seaman Fisher.

1244
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:06,670
Sir?

1245
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,640
Get up here.

1246
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:09,870
What I do?

1247
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,810
Cut the jaw jackin'.
Up here right now.

1248
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,410
I don't know what
you think you're up to...

1249
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:17,340
but you better be careful.

1250
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:18,350
I didn't do anything.

1251
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:19,640
You didn't do anything?

1252
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,650
You didn't do anything?

1253
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,280
I didn't do anything.

1254
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:24,750
My wife is inviting
you to Thanksgiving.

1255
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,150
She thinks you're very charming.

1256
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,220
Do you have any idea...

1257
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,590
where she might've
gotten that impression?

1258
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:30,590
Huh?

1259
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,920
Look at me when I'm talkin' to you.

1260
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,050
No, sir.

1261
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,760
Maybe she responds to nice people.

1262
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,060
Okay, nice people.
Next Thursday.

1263
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,290
Thanksgiving,
my house...

1264
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,870
my family, my dinner table. 1400.

1265
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,030
Don't be late.

1266
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,040
Yes, sir.

1267
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,570
Get outta here.

1268
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,410
It's nice out here.

1269
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,740
How'd you find this place?

1270
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:54,320
It's a lighthouse.

1271
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,720
I'm a sailor.

1272
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,850
It found me.

1273
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,150
You knucklehead.

1274
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,620
You come out here a lot?

1275
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,990
Sometimes I come out here to think.

1276
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,120
Or to work out some problems.

1277
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,720
Mmm.

1278
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,030
I know what you mean.

1279
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,330
Well, um...

1280
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:17,110
Can I be honest with you?

1281
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,400
Yeah.

1282
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,380
Remember when I, uh...

1283
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,180
I told you that I was...

1284
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,810
I was workin' on
that important paper?

1285
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,550
Yeah.

1286
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,720
Well, I lied.

1287
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,660
I know.

1288
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,890
You know?

1289
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,130
Yeah.

1290
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,230
You're seein' a psychiatrist, aren't you?

1291
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,740
Ohh...

1292
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,740
you knew.

1293
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,740
Yeah, I knew.

1294
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,330
It wasn't that hard to figure out.

1295
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,070
Mmm...

1296
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,770
Are you tryin' to tell me I'm crazy?

1297
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,780
No.

1298
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,110
So?

1299
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,320
So I'll understand if you...

1300
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,650
If you don't wanna
be bothered no more.

1301
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,650
You're not the only person...

1302
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,850
that's seen a shrink before.

1303
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,950
Oh, you seen one?

1304
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:12,960
No...

1305
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,260
but I told you
my dad's a Vietnam vet.

1306
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,700
He has.

1307
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,200
I guess he made it, huh?

1308
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:28,270
So, why...
why are you seein' a psychiatrist?

1309
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,610
My life before the navy
was kind of complicated.

1310
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,780
I was feelin' ashamed.

1311
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,820
Of what?

1312
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,980
Of bein' unwanted.

1313
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,560
And, uh...

1314
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:46,100
I had no parents.

1315
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,100
Mmm...

1316
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,360
You know, I was...

1317
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,600
I was afraid to even approach you.

1318
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,900
Would you believe...

1319
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,410
that...

1320
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,280
I was too shy to approach you?

1321
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,650
- No.
- Yeah.

1322
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,280
Um, until I realized
you were stalking me.

1323
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,290
I wasn't stalking you.

1324
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:20,560
Well, if there's anything
I could do to help...

1325
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,660
I'm here.

1326
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:25,500
You're doin' it already.

1327
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,130
What am I doin'?

1328
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,230
Just bein' you.

1329
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,950
Happy Thanksgiving.

1330
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,650
Um...

1331
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,220
happy Thanksgiving.
Happy holidays, sir.

1332
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,730
Happy holidays, ma'am.

1333
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:53,320
I know.

1334
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,830
It's... Berta.

1335
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:56,830
Yeah.

1336
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:58,770
Come on... come on in.

1337
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,200
Hello.

1338
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,500
I'm Antwone.

1339
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:07,580
I, um...

1340
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,740
Yeah, I'm hungry.

1341
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:12,250
I could eat.

1342
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,910
1400, huh?
What took you so long?

1343
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,510
Oh, I stopped by
to get some cider, sir.

1344
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,250
- Okay. Good.
- Happy holidays.

1345
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,250
Thank you. Come on in.

1346
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,480
Everybody's here waitin' for you.

1347
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,360
We're about to say grace.

1348
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,190
All right, everybody.
This is Antwone.

1349
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,820
- Antwone, this is my family.
- Hello

1350
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,020
- That's my mother Johnny Mae.
- Hello

1351
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,930
That's my wife's brother Uncle Duke.

1352
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,560
- How you doin'?
- Hello, sir.

1353
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:32,730
This is my dad Howard.

1354
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,570
- That's my sister Gwen...
- How you doin'?

1355
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,570
And her full-grown daughter.

1356
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:37,570
Hi, Antwone.

1357
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,340
Oh, you wanna come and sit next to her?

1358
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,070
Gwen, Gwen. Uh...

1359
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,580
Come on, baby.
You come on over here and sit.

1360
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,510
Okay.

1361
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:47,750
All right.

1362
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,790
Duke, why don't you lead us in prayer?

1363
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:51,950
Okay.

1364
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,290
Everybody join hands.

1365
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,660
Let's bow our heads.

1366
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,230
Heavenly Father...

1367
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,850
we come to you on bent knee...

1368
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,730
and body bowed...

1369
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:05,170
as humble as we know how.

1370
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,930
We are grateful for this opportunity...

1371
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,560
to share another Thanksgiving Day...

1372
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:09,640
as a family.

1373
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,830
We thank you for our health...

1374
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,810
O Lord, and for our friends...

1375
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:15,440
who honor us with their presence.

1376
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,140
We also pray for peace in the world...

1377
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,580
and in our lives. Amen.

1378
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,080
Amen.

1379
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,880
All right.

1380
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,390
This looks good.
Yeah!

1381
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:38,800
Here's a little piece.

1382
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,170
Thank you. Mmm.

1383
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,330
Honey,
you want some more turkey?

1384
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,840
Oh, no,
thank you, ma'am.

1385
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,770
Ohh, don't be actin'
all bashful around me.

1386
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,740
Especially at the dinner table.

1387
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,180
Dad, leave that boy alone.

1388
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,480
Shoot!

1389
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,410
- Huh?
- I'm okay.

1390
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,320
All right, then,
let me see you dig in.

1391
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,480
I mean, the food is free.

1392
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,320
Howard...

1393
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,590
You know, when I was in the service...

1394
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:05,630
back in the war... that was
before you were born...

1395
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,090
Howard!

1396
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,500
Anyway, I spent the holidays...

1397
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,690
in Europe on guard duty,
and I... ohh!

1398
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,700
I sure did miss my mama's
holiday cookin'. Whoo-oo!

1399
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,740
Howard, would you leave the boy alone?

1400
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,770
Oh, I ain't botherin' him none, Johnny Mae.

1401
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,000
No, you leave me alone, huh?

1402
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,300
Baby, he wants to eat!

1403
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:23,710
Oh, no, look, I'm just talkin' to the boy.

1404
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:26,110
I'm sure he wants to be
home with his family, okay?

1405
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,650
Hey, listen,
let me ask you something.

1406
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,620
Where you from?

1407
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,620
Cleveland.

1408
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,710
Cleveland. Yeah?

1409
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:32,720
Yeah.

1410
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,220
Cleveland...

1411
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,230
I bet you miss your mama's
holiday cookin'...

1412
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,450
don't you? Huh?

1413
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,130
Excuse me.

1414
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,210
Where he goin'?

1415
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,680
I don't know.

1416
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,780
See?
That's what happens every holiday season.

1417
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:05,860
Why do you want to do that to the boy?

1418
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,450
Y'all ran the boy outta here!

1419
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,990
That's what happens every holiday!

1420
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,150
I didn't run the boy out.
I was tryin'

1421
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,190
to talk to the boy.

1422
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,190
You okay?

1423
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,360
Yes, I'm okay.

1424
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:19,700
I just never had
a real Thanksgiving...

1425
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,030
at the Tates' before.

1426
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,570
You didn't have a real one...

1427
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:24,400
over here either, I guess.

1428
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,910
You have a real nice family.

1429
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,480
Thank you.

1430
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:29,800
I got this for you...

1431
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,710
for having me over today.

1432
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,080
Oh, you got a gift for me.
Is it money?

1433
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,210
No.

1434
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,820
Oh, it's a poem.

1435
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:44,420
I can't see without my glasses.

1436
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:45,720
Why don't you read it for me?

1437
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:47,730
Um, I'd rather you read it.

1438
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,260
Please.

1439
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,270
"Who will cry for the little boy?

1440
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,970
"Lost and all alone.

1441
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,670

01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,610

Who will cry for the little boy, Antwone?

1460
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:52,120
I will.

1461
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:56,960
I always do.

1462
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,010
It's beautiful, Antwone.

1463
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,810
I know. I told you I was good.

1464
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,110
Yes, you are.
You are good...

1465
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,780
because you're honest.

1466
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,550
You're more honest than most people...

1467
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,880
even in your anger.

1468
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:21,890
The only thing you're
not honest with yourself...

1469
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:24,620
about is your need
to find your own family.

1470
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,390
Your natural family.

1471
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,120
I don't feel like
I need to look for them.

1472
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,600
Mmm. It would answer
a lot of questions for you.

1473
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,260
I don't have any questions.

1474
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,530
You're upset with them...

1475
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,370
because you feel they
didn't come to your rescue.

1476
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,370
Maybe they didn't know.

1477
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,810
How could they not have known?

1478
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:43,610
That's a question you need to ask them.

1479
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,150
"Regard without ill will...

1480
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,080
despite an offense."

1481
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,020
That's Webster's definition of forgiveness.

1482
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,520
Why do I have to forgive?

1483
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,420
To free yourself...

1484
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,220
so that you can get on with your life.

1485
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,060
Why I gotta go look for my family?

1486
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:04,000
I got you, Doc.

1487
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,440
Ohh...

1488
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,740
I think that he had a good time tonight.

1489
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:21,750
Hmm?

1490
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,680
Antwone.
I think that, uh...

1491
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,050
he had a good time, don't you?

1492
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,550
Yeah, seemed like it.

1493
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,650
He did the sweetest thing at the door...

1494
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,530
when he was saying good-bye.

1495
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:37,400
He invited me to come to his ceremony.

1496
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,630
You know he's graduating
from his Japanese class.

1497
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:40,630
Yeah, I know.

1498
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,000
Well, he wants me to come.

1499
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,940
To be with you.

1500
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,700
What did you tell him?

1501
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,830
I told him that I would
be honored, Jerome.

1502
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,870
Okay...

1503
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,220
Okay.

1504
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:04,580
Congratulations.

1505
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:06,720
Petty Officer Fisher.
Good job.

1506
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,380
Thank you, Commander.

1507
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:09,650
I was waiting.
Cheryl, right?

1508
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,660
How you doin', Cheryl?

1509
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,820
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1510
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,160
Heard nothin' but
good things about you.

1511
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,160
Where's your wife?

1512
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,670
She couldn't make it.

1513
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,670
She sends along her congratulations.

1514
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,000
A small gift for you.

1515
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,630
Okay.

1516
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:23,210
The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey.

1517
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,210
Thank you, sir.

1518
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:26,510
You're welcome.

1519
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,140
Is there somewhere
we can talk in private?

1520
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,410
Do you mind?

1521
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,110
That's fine.
I don't mind.

1522
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,310
Okay.
Nice to meet you.

1523
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,250
Nice to meet you, sir.

1524
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:41,320
Hello?

1525
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:42,950
What's up, Doc?

1526
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,360
How are you?

1527
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:46,990
I'm good.

1528
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,470
Yes, you are, Antwone.

1529
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,760
You're good.

1530
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:50,800
I hear nothin' but good things...

1531
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,270
from your C.O.

1532
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,500
Hear that you're
gettin' along very well...

1533
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,010
with your shipmates.
I'm proud of you.

1534
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:59,840
Thank you, sir.

1535
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,940
Have you thought anymore
about finding your family?

1536
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,210
I don't know.
For what?

1537
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,220
Well, I just think
that there's really nothing...

1538
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,050
more important than that, Antwone.

1539
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,680
What are you tryin' to say, sir?

1540
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,250
That I'm proud of you...

1541
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,330
that I think you've come a long way.

1542
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:17,330
Okay.

1543
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:20,660
You said that.
What's wrong?

1544
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,960
There's nothin' wrong.

1545
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:29,100
You understand,
this is very difficult for me.

1546
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,670
Our sessions have ended.

1547
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,580
Now, listen.

1548
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,310
Just listen to me, all right?

1549
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,310
I've taken the liberty of...

1550
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,410
What do you mean, they ended?

1551
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,640
They... They ended, son,
and it's time for you...

1552
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,310
to move on.
You can't stall here.

1553
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,650
But you and me are
workin' out my problems.

1554
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,650
You and me can't work out...

1555
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,650
You told me that we need...

1556
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,660
to figure out my problems.

1557
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,120
- Listen to me...
- Get off me!

1558
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,520
Hey, get out!

1559
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:50,150
- Get out!
- Nobody ever stays!

1560
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,320
Everybody's always leavin' me!

1561
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:52,900
People grow.
People move on.

1562
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,400
You've grown.
It's time for you to move on.

1563
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,870
Hey, my mother left me!

1564
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:56,940
- My father!
- I understand...

1565
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,260
Jesse and you!

1566
01:16:58,370 --> 01:16:59,740
Jesse? What do you mean?

1567
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,500
We shoulda never gone,
that's what. Jesse!

1568
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,510
Jesse?
Tell me something...

1569
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,100
Cow bells ringin' in my fuckin' head!

1570
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,180
Cow bells?
Tell me about the cow bells...

1571
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,540
But I keep trustin' people!

1572
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:09,640
Trustin'...

1573
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:14,980
What happened to Jesse, Antwone?

1574
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,180
Stay away from me.

1575
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:18,420
Nobody's takin' anything else away...

1576
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,920
from me no more.

1577
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,840
Who is it?

1578
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,920
Man, I just asked who was it.

1579
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,140
Fish! Oh!

1580
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:47,690
Hey, what's up, dog?

1581
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:49,350
What's up with you, man?

1582
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,440
What's goin' on with you, man?

1583
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,450
Hey, man, stop playin'.

1584
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,460
Stop playin'?
All right...

1585
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,920
don't make me kick your ass now.

1586
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,490
You know you can't fight worth shit.

1587
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,490
Man...

1588
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,650
What's up with you, man?

1589
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,660
What's up with you?

1590
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,060
Where you been at?

1591
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,360
Where you stayin'?
What's up?

1592
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,370
Huh?

1593
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,630
I'm at the men's shelter.

1594
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:10,370
On Prospect.

1595
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,500
Where you stayin' at, man?
For real.

1596
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:14,670
I'm on the street.

1597
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,010
What you doin' on the streets, man?

1598
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,880
I got nowhere else to go, man.

1599
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,210
You ain't got nowhere to go.

1600
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,950
You couldn't come to my house?

1601
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:23,680
No, man. Your mom ain't
gonna let me stay up in here.

1602
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,810
You trippin', man.
She ain't gotta know.

1603
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,050
I mean,
she work all day...

1604
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,220
sleep all night.
Besides...

1605
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,390
there's so many people stayin' up...

1606
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,620
in this house,

1607
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:32,430
She wouldn't even know
you're here no way, dog.

1608
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:33,790
You can stay here,
for real.

1609
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,200
Y'all got something in the refrigerator?

1610
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,670
Yeah, we got something...

1611
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:40,670
You hungry?

1612
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:42,040
- I'm hungry.
- You hungry?

1613
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,070
- Yeah, man.
- "Yeah, man."

1614
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,540
- Stop playin'.
- Come in here.

1615
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,870
I mean, you smell like you been...

1616
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,910
on the streets, too, man.

1617
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,220
Dang, slow down, man.

1618
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,150
Ain't nobody gonna take your food.

1619
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,220
Hey...
Hey, you remember that time...

1620
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,190
Mrs. Tate wouldn't let you use her lotion?

1621
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:00,350
She made you oil up
with old cooking grease instead.

1622
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:01,550
You walking around all day...

1623
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,990
smelling like a fried chicken dinner.

1624
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,530
You like,
"I sho' is hungry!"

1625
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,000
Man, that was so funny.

1626
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,860
That had me rolling for real.

1627
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:09,960
But not as funny as your mother...

1628
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:11,370
chasing you down the street with that brick.

1629
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:12,960
Oh, okay, okay.
You remember that?

1630
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:13,970
Yeah, I remember that.

1631
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:15,040
That was funny.

1632
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,370
Dude,
that wasn't funny, man.

1633
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,100
I still got the knot
in the back of my head.

1634
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:22,970
Fish, you know you're
my best friend, right?

1635
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,140
What you want?

1636
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,220
What, I can't be happy
my dude back on the block?

1637
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:30,690
Huh? I can't be happy
you back here at home, man?

1638
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:32,880
I want you to do something for me, though.

1639
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,290
What?

1640
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:35,550
Just look out for me.

1641
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,560
Somebody after you?

1642
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:39,190
Why somebody got to be after me, man?

1643
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,270
Huh?

1644
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:43,030
I just want you to look out for me, dude.

1645
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,030
All right.

1646
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:45,100
You my best friend, right?

1647
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,400
Yeah, man.
Stop trippin', man.

1648
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,700
Man, come on.
Let's get you cleaned up...

1649
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:49,740
and hit the streets.

1650
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,240
Yeah, I don't know.

1651
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,940
You know Brenda.
I used to like her.

1652
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:54,810
Psh.
The Brenda you used to like, dog...

1653
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:56,780
got about, like, 3 kids now.

1654
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,820
Gettin' all swole.
She big for real, dog.

1655
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,910
Ain't no little bootie Brenda no more.

1656
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,720
Hey, how's your mother?

1657
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,260
Aw, tsh, man,
she got knocked up.

1658
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,260
For real?

1659
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,260
Yeah.

1660
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:14,960
It's bad.

1661
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,860
Go ahead, man.
Get you something.

1662
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:18,990
I got you.

1663
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:33,720
Break it off, old man!

1664
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:34,720
Jess, what you doing?

1665
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:35,980
This ain't no riddle.

1666
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:37,150
This ain't nothing
you got to figure out.

1667
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,380
- Jess...
- Hey, hold off, Fish.

1668
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,480
Hey,
you better break off my loot!

1669
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:41,290
- Hey, Jess, man...
- Look out for me, Fish.

1670
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,160
And by the end of the next day...

1671
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,360
I was in boot camp.

1672
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:28,600
I always felt like
Jesse was the lucky one...

1673
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:30,510
and I envied him for it.

1674
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:32,510
Well, how could he
be the lucky one? He's dead.

1675
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:33,670
Yeah, well, he left me...

1676
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,440
and he knew he was the only one I had.

1677
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,180
So, you're angry at him...

1678
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,050
because you felt he abandoned you.

1679
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,920
Yes.

1680
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,490
A little bit.

1681
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:46,060
How is he the lucky one?

1682
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,130
'Cause he don't have to fight no more.

1683
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,700
Neither do you.

1684
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,990
So, you think I'll make it?

1685
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,360
I think you already have.

1686
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:57,490
What do you think?

1687
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,400
I think, uh...

1688
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:03,240
maybe in another life or time...

1689
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,210
I would have been king.

1690
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,670
When you locate your family...

1691
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:30,170
I want you to contact me.

1692
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:32,530
All right?
I want to hear all about it.

1693
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:37,870
Yes, sir.

1694
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,850
I love you, son.

1695
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,010
I love you, too.

1696
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,820
Who's this?

1697
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,450
Guess who.

1698
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,550
Antwone.

1699
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,150
No, this is Phillip Walker...

1700
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:29,990
the late-night stalker.

1701
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,120
Aw.

1702
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:34,330
So...

1703
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:40,240
I, um,
I'm going on leave.

1704
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,900
When?

1705
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,740
As soon as you
put your request in...

1706
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,780
and come with me.

1707
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,400
You serious?

1708
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:49,070
Yes.

1709
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,510
I just came back.

1710
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,880
They're not gonna let me
leave again this year.

1711
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:57,920
Can you ask for emergency leave?

1712
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,490
Tell them somebody close to you...

1713
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,820
is in desperate need.

1714
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,490
Cheryl, I...

1715
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,290
I really want you to come with me.

1716
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,870
I got these, uh...

1717
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:11,400
2 open tickets.

1718
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:14,560
To Cleveland.

1719
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:17,780
You're gonna try and find them.

1720
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,180
Yeah.
I need to find them.

1721
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,750
But not without your help.

1722
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,850
All right.
Let me see what I can do.

1723
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:44,060
First the light-skinned girls.

1724
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,330
They got adopted the quickest.

1725
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,960
Then the light-skinned boys...

1726
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:49,870
and then the dark-skinned girls...

1727
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:52,310
and then,
last but not least...

1728
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:53,570
the dark-skinned boys.

1729
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,810
I'm really sorry.

1730
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,510
All birth records since 1980...

1731
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,210
have been moved to social services.

1732
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,560
Last contact with your mother?

1733
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:25,230
I was 2 months old.

1734
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:26,330
And with father?

1735
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:28,470
Never.

1736
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:32,540
Place of birth.

1737
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:35,640
Ohio State Correctional Facility for Women.

1738
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:41,090
I'll be right back.

1739
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,280
I need you to sign for me.

1740
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:17,660
Best of luck, Mr. Fisher.

1741
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,200
Thank you.

1742
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,740
There's nothing in here.

1743
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,400
Why don't you go see your foster mother?

1744
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,760
- Who, Mrs. Tate?
- Yeah.

1745
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,340
I'm not... I'm...

1746
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,840
I'm not going back.

1747
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:02,700
Well, why not?

1748
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:05,300
I mean, she might know
something about your family.

1749
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:06,310
No.

1750
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:06,100
I haven't done this before.

1751
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,600
Take a ride with me.

1752
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,080
If you selling shit,
just keep on walking.

1753
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,700
Oh, my God.
Is that you, Antwone?

1754
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,700
Come here, baby.

1755
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,200
Don't touch me.

1756
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:51,270
Yeah, it's me...

1757
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:53,670
and I'm all grown up.

1758
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,100
I'd like to speak to Ms. Tate.

1759
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:59,970
Well, you want to come in?

1760
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,740
No.

1761
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:03,470
Would you like to get her?

1762
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,050
'Twon's here.

1763
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,650
Lord have mercy.

1764
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,020
Where's the child?

1765
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:18,360
Oh, nigger!
Hug my neck.

1766
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:26,630
Oh, nigger.

1767
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:29,670
I...
Don't you know how to come home?

1768
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:30,430
Where you been?

1769
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,440
I came for one thing:

1770
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:35,340
Whatever you can tell me
about my real family.

1771
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:39,380
I don't know nothing
about your real peoples.

1772
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,750
A name, number, anything?

1773
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,290
I said I don't know.

1774
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:46,050
Now, come along.
Come on.

1775
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,890
I remember everything.

1776
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,290
Everything.

1777
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,890
You could have helped me...

1778
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,900
but instead, you beat me
to dust, and you...

1779
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,990
Boy, I don't know
what you're talking about...

1780
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,230
Yes, you do.
I was 6 years old!

1781
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,570
Now, you just listen...

1782
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:00,600
No, you listen to me!

1783
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:01,900
No, I think you done forgotten...

1784
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:04,030
I think you forgotten.
I said listen to me.

1785
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,080
This is my time.

1786
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,110
You understand me?

1787
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:12,510
It don't matter...

1788
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,710
what you tried to do.

1789
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,190
You couldn't destroy me.

1790
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:18,310
I'm still standing.

1791
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,150
I'm still strong.

1792
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,300
And I always will be.

1793
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:50,590
Antwone.

1794
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,120
Elkins.

1795
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,300
Your father's name was Edward Elkins.

1796
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:21,110
You take Shaker Heights and East Cleveland...

1797
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,620
and I'm gonna take Akron and Cleveland.

1798
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:30,830
Yeah. 1976.

1799
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:32,090
Hello. Hi, um...

1800
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:35,290
I'm looking for the family of Edward Elkins.

1801
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,330
Edward Elkins.

1802
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,680
Hello.

1803
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:52,410
Hi, I'm looking for the family...

1804
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,850
no... Ed-ward.

1805
01:33:54,950 --> 01:34:00,260
E-D-W-A-R-D.

1806
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,450
What? I'm speaking clearly.

1807
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,690
You can't...

1808
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,690
Okay.

1809
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,060
Well, thank...
thank you.

1810
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,260
I'm looking for the family...

1811
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,860
of an Edward Elkins.

1812
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:11,400
You should have said
that in the first place.

1813
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,130
Wha... why you...

1814
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,350
Forget it, man.

1815
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:32,150
Yeah, well,
we're from California.

1816
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:35,950
Yes, it's very nice here.

1817
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,430
Okay, well, thank you
for your help, ma'am.

1818
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:41,430
Thank you. Bye.

1819
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:43,530
Any luck?

1820
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:48,010
What you got?

1821
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:49,130
Chinese.

1822
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,020
Hello?

1823
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,020
Hello, ma'am.

1824
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:09,180
Yes?

1825
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:10,690
I'm looking for the family...

1826
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,790
of an Edward Elkins.

1827
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:16,100
Hmm?

1828
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,190
Wh-who is this calling about Edward?

1829
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,790
My name is Antwone Fisher.

1830
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:22,270
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1831
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:23,860
I'm just trying to locate my family.

1832
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:27,270
Honey, Edward Elkins been dead...

1833
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,850
a long time.

1834
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:29,970
Yes, ma'am, I know...

1835
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,680
a long time, but he was my father.

1836
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:40,560
Wait, wait, wait.
Who is this...

1837
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,420
calling me up out of nowhere?

1838
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:43,820
How'd you get this number?

1839
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:45,360
I got your number
out of the phone book.

1840
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,560
I been calling Elkins all day.

1841
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,190
Got no reason to lie to you, ma'am.

1842
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:53,430
Well, honey,
Edward never mentioned no...

1843
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,870
What's your name again?

1844
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:56,240
Antwone.

1845
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,310
Antwone.

1846
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:00,280
I don't think he knew
my mother was pregnant.

1847
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,540
She was away in prison.

1848
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:04,640
You know how he died?

1849
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:05,720
Yes, ma'am.

1850
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:08,340
He was murdered by
one of his girlfriends.

1851
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:11,820
My God.

1852
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,320
Wait.

1853
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:16,050
What made you decide to show up...

1854
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,760
20-some-odd years later
in the middle of the night?

1855
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,990
Mmm, that's a long story.

1856
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,500
But I'm in the navy...

1857
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:25,230
and, uh, I'm stationed on the west coast.

1858
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,900
I gotta get back in a few days.

1859
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:29,670
Well, I... I want you to come
by my house before you go.

1860
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:30,740
Okay.

1861
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,040
Okay, look.
Y-Y-You have a pencil?

1862
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:35,080
Take down my address.

1863
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,080
Yeah.

1864
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:40,210
It's 1089 Drexel.

1865
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,680
1089 Drexel.

1866
01:36:41,790 --> 01:36:42,680
You know where that is?

1867
01:36:42,790 --> 01:36:43,850
Yes, ma'am.

1868
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,190
All right, well, come by
my house tomorrow, hear?

1869
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,420
- Okay. Um, ma'am...
- Yes?

1870
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:50,590
You mind if I bring
my girlfriend with me?

1871
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:53,260
Yes, fine. I'm... I'm looking
forward to meeting her.

1872
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:55,600
I'm sure she's looking
forward to meeting you, too.

1873
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,000
You... listen.
You know, if...

1874
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,970
If Edward was your father...

1875
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:02,970
then you talking to your auntie, son.

1876
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:05,630
You are talking to your Auntie Annette...

1877
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:09,080
your daddy's baby sister.

1878
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:10,840
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

1879
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:11,940
I'll see you tomorrow.

1880
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:12,950
Good night.

1881
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:14,540
Bye.

1882
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:41,970
I found them.

1883
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,410
Hmm?

1884
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,450
I found my family.

1885
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,640
You did?

1886
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:49,650
Mm-hmm.

1887
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52,880
Oh, baby.

1888
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:55,120
Mmm.

1889
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,700
I don't know.
What do you think?

1890
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:10,170
Well, he does look like Eddie.

1891
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,240
I do?

1892
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,110
Yeah, you look just like him.

1893
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:15,270
Mm-hmm.

1894
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,720
I brought my birth certificate.

1895
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,260
Born in '76.

1896
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,190
That's the year Edward died.

1897
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,590
Yeah, he...
He died in June...

1898
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,460
and I was born in August.

1899
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:37,660
And your mother's name is...

1900
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:40,000
- Eva Mae Fisher.
- Eva Mae Fisher.

1901
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,800
Eva?

1902
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:44,470
I know Eva.
That's Jess's sister.

1903
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,470
Who?

1904
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,010
Jess.

1905
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:48,040
You mean Fish?

1906
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:49,840
Yeah, Fish.
Jess Fisher.

1907
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:51,750
The boy's name is Antwone Fisher.

1908
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:54,220
That's Jess Fisher's sister, Eva Mae.

1909
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,250
You know, Mae-Mae.

1910
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:56,580
She live over there on Hodge Street.

1911
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:58,380
No, I don't remember no Mae-Mae.

1912
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,850
Y-You know where she lives?

1913
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,290
You don't know her, do you?

1914
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,400
No. I... I...

1915
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:16,410
No, no.

1916
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:17,530
You want to meet her?

1917
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:21,640
Uh...

1918
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:28,720
yeah.

1919
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:31,220
Yeah, yeah.

1920
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:32,480
You sure?

1921
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:34,080
'Cause we can take care
of this right here and now.

1922
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,260
Yeah, I'm sure.

1923
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:41,990
Let me get my hat.

1924
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,370
Want me to go with you?

1925
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:56,340
No, why don't you just stay
here with us, baby?

1926
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:58,280
Okay, let's ride.

1927
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:07,590
Bye.

1928
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:42,080
You're not gonna let nothing
happen to me, are you?

1929
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:43,290
No, Antwone.

1930
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:45,390
I won't let nothing happen to you.

1931
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:24,860
Who is it?

1932
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:26,630
Eva, it's James.
James Elkins.

1933
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:28,040
Edward's brother.

1934
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,770
Did you hear me, Eva?

1935
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,110
This is James.

1936
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,070
What you want?

1937
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:38,710
Can we come in?

1938
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:54,630
Hey, Eva.

1939
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,630
Hey.

1940
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:00,200
It's all right, son.
Come on.

1941
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:07,280
Who's that, Eva?

1942
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,210
That's Johnny.

1943
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,410
No.

1944
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,280
That's Antwone Quenton Fisher.

1945
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:28,860
Who's Antwone Quenton Fisher, Eva?

1946
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,370
That's my first-born son.

1947
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:42,810
Oh, God.

1948
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:43,810
Ohh!

1949
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:51,420
There's nothing going on around here.

1950
01:42:53,190 --> 01:42:55,060
You wanna stay?

1951
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,560
I'm gonna stay.

1952
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:59,730
I'll be in the car.

1953
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:42,800
You want something to eat?

1954
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:44,700
No.

1955
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:50,910
Why'd you never come for me?

1956
01:43:54,990 --> 01:43:56,850
Didn't you wonder where I was...

1957
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:00,790
or what I was doing...

1958
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:02,420
or what I'd become...

1959
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,750
or even if I was still alive?

1960
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,760
Didn't you?

1961
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:30,040
I've taken care of myself.

1962
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:31,350
I have.

1963
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:34,760
I've never been in trouble with the law.

1964
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:40,400
I've read hundreds of books...

1965
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,590
written poems...

1966
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:45,460
painted pictures.

1967
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:47,270
I've traveled the world.

1968
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:50,970
I serve my country.

1969
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:55,410
I speak 2 languages...

1970
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:57,910
and I'm working on a third.

1971
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:03,080
I never fathered any children.

1972
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:04,850
I've never done drugs...

1973
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,580
or even smoked a cigarette.

1974
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,040
I used to dream about you.

1975
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:32,510
My mother.

1976
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:34,380
My mother.

1977
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:36,750
You know,
what you'd be like.

1978
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,320
How you look.

1979
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:43,990
Your voice and your smile.

1980
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:45,430
Even your scent.

1981
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:52,590
For all these years
I wondered about you.

1982
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:57,110
I dreamed about you.
Didn't you miss me?

1983
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,970
On the way to school
each day...

1984
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:08,450
I imagined you were just
around the next corner...

1985
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:13,320
and when I'd get there,
you'd be there.

1986
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:19,590
And in my mind,
you was always there.

1987
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:22,860
You just couldn't find me.

1988
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:26,870
So I'd race to the next corner...

1989
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:28,300
and you'd be there.

1990
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:30,600
I'd know you would.

1991
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:37,080
Then you would
buy me ice cream.

1992
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:41,170
And then you would take me home.

1993
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,330
I'm a good person.

1994
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,240
I'm a good man.

1995
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:07,170
Hey, boy, how you doin'?
I'm your Uncle Horace.

1996
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:10,330
Get out of the way, Horace.
Come on, baby. Here he is!

1997
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,170
Oh, look at you!
Look at you!

1998
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,240
I'm your Aunt Eda, baby.

1999
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:17,040
Ooh, I'm your cousin Jeanette.

2000
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:19,010
Welcome home!

2001
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:21,450
And I'm your Aunt Anna.
How you doin', baby?

2002
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,420
This is my wife, "T."

2003
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:30,430
How you doin', good-lookin'?

2004
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:31,430
I'm your cousin Eddie.

2005
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:33,360
My dad named me after your father.

2006
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,430
And this is my brother Ray.

2007
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:36,760
Whassup, dog?
What's crackin', man?

2008
01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:39,730
Hey, I'm your cousin Jason, man.
What's happenin'?

2009
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,770
All right, boys, open up.

2010
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:09,090
Welcome.

2011
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:20,470
All right.

2012
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:21,660
Come on, let's eat!

2013
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:30,810
You want some pancakes? Ooh.

2014
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,810
Sure, sure.

2015
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:36,680
Here we go.

2016
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:37,950
How about some sausages?

2017
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:06,410
I'm not a virgin anymore.

2018
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:13,360
I'm glad to hear that.

2019
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:22,160
How you doin', son?

2020
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:23,160
I'm great, sir.

2021
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,170
All right. Good.
Good, good.

2022
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:25,670
Very good to see you.

2023
01:51:25,770 --> 01:51:27,400
So?

2024
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:28,800
I took your advice.

2025
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:32,640
I found my family
and I found my mother.

2026
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:33,640
Good.

2027
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:35,080
Yeah.

2028
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,410
So?

2029
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:38,240
Well, in my heart I forgive her...

2030
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:41,510
but if I never saw her again...

2031
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:43,180
I understand.

2032
01:51:43,290 --> 01:51:45,920
It's funny to feel that way
about your mother...

2033
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:47,920
but I did it...

2034
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:50,020
and I owe it to you to tell you
that you were right.

2035
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:51,320
You owe it to me?

2036
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:52,420
Yes, sir.

2037
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:53,790
I needed to find her.

2038
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:56,700
Yeah. Well...

2039
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,030
if I was right, it was
for all the wrong reasons.

2040
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:00,930
Sir?

2041
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,530
This stays between you and me, okay?

2042
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,870
Yes, sir.

2043
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:08,040
My wife and I, we were gonna
have a bunch of kids...

2044
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:10,110
when we found out
we couldn't have any.

2045
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:12,770
And it rocked her to the core.

2046
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,440
I knew what to do for her, though.

2047
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:16,920
She needed help, treatment.

2048
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:18,390
I made sure she had it.

2049
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:21,190
The best psychiatrist,
the one that trained me.

2050
01:52:21,290 --> 01:52:24,090
But I...
the well one, the strong one...

2051
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:30,100
At the same time I went about
the business of shutting down.

2052
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,930
Very subtle, very quiet.
It was my little secret.

2053
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:39,640
Until one day, a young man came
into my office and into my life...

2054
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:43,510
and he blew up that little
secret, right in my face.

2055
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:48,420
And he put me to shame in a way
I never thought possible.

2056
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:54,580
Because of you, Antwone,
I'm a better doctor...

2057
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:58,180
and I'm learning
to be a better husband.

2058
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:04,030
You don't owe me anything.
I owe you.

2059
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:05,190
You're the champ, son.

2060
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:07,460
You've beaten everybody
who was beating you.

2061
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:10,970
I salute you.

2062
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:18,800
You hungry, sailor?

2063
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,750
I could eat, sir.

2064
01:53:23,650 --> 01:53:24,850
Let's go.
