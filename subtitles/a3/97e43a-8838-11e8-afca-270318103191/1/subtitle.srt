1
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,643
Good morning grandma
good morning dad, good morning mom

2
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,949
Man Fai, how dare you

3
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,488
Sister

4
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,624
You can't fool her They've all gone out

5
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,520
Wo

6
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,889
Miss Man Fai, today's the day

7
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,600
Don't you dare

8
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,031
Got to go

9
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,542
Man Fai, practise your music at home
I'll teach you English when I come back

10
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,201
And don't go out, alright

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,576
We don't want trouble from grandma

12
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,845
She doesn't want you to be seen on the street

13
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,043
I hear you

14
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:02,881
Let's go

15
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,047
Wo, we are off to school

16
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,055
See you

17
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,725
Miss Man Fai, mind the steps

18
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,896
How do I look My clothes

19
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,727
Pretty in pink, very cheerful

20
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,057
Let's go then

21
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,899
Miss Man Fai, alright, hold on to me
Mind the steps

22
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,324
Wo, why even bother

23
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,898
San, stuff it

24
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,097
Look at her
What a baggage to tuck along

25
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,261
It's embarrassing

26
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,428
What did they say

27
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,571
Nothing, it's just noise

28
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,270
Careful now

29
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:04,281
Hold my arm, we're on a big road

30
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,965
Are there lots of
trees and birds around

31
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,930
Yes, now that you mention it

32
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,135
Actually, there are trees on both sides

33
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,141
Really

34
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,470
They block the sun, I take this
road to the market everyday

35
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,639
I smell cooking

36
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,618
That's right
it's the smell of soya sauce

37
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,813
What is the color of this smell

38
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,658
Soy is black
and the colour of the smell

39
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,058
Is the color of soy

40
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,163
Stand here stay still

41
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,169
What is that

42
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,034
It sinks

43
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,831
It's a motor car

44
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,166
Careful

45
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,174
What is that

46
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,638
A bicycle

47
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,914
Just remember, stay out of their
way They can run you over

48
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,021
Why the car stinks and
the bicycle doesn't

49
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,416
The motor farts all the time
that's why it stinks

50
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,096
Price gone up again

51
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:29,032
Inﬂation When the civil war breaks out
we'll have nothing to eat

52
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,032
Alright, I've have a piece

53
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,395
It's a puppy That's right

54
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,702
Miss Man Fai, squat down
and touch it Sure

55
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,542
Just what you need, Miss

56
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,371
When it grows up, it can be your guide

57
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,077
Let's go, forget about him

58
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,049
You want it, Miss Blind

59
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,482
Shut you face, you dog

60
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,858
Miss, be careful

61
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,094
There you go

62
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,961
Are you blind I want liver
not the knuckle

63
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,158
My fault

64
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,397
Sit here, be careful

65
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,067
Have a piece of cake

66
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,537
What's up Are you still angry

67
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,240
How do you know

68
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,642
I can tell from your face

69
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,075
My face Sure

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,653
When you are happy, you are like this

71
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,915
When you are angry
you are like this

72
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,752
I can tell at once

73
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,157
When you are happy
you look really good

74
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,063
Wo, I wish I could see
just like you

75
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,931
Miss Man Fai
actually you can see too

76
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,437
Only you see in a different way

77
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:47,170
We see with our eyes
and you see with your hands

78
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,443
I don't always see clearly

79
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,812
But you can see through
things with your heart

80
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,783
She's blind

81
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,282
Stop it Hey you Get lost

82
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,856
Have you any manners
Don't you have parents

83
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,297
Don't you kid know anything
Scrum bags

84
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,533
Go away Get lost

85
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,097
She must have done something
bad in her previous life

86
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,467
Her dad's got crabs

87
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,974
No, I can't do that

88
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,138
Mother, this isn't such a good idea

89
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,311
I don't understand your thinking

90
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,645
I said long ago she should
earn to play music

91
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,481
If you've listened, she would
have a skill to make a living

92
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,649
Mother, we can't force Man Fai
to be an entertainer

93
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,158
She can make a living by herself

94
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,820
Better than being a burden, forever a
burden to her brother &amp; sister

95
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,329
This is for her own sake too

96
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,966
I'll buy her a ﬂat
she can live off the rent

97
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,695
Wake up Civil war has
broken out in the North

98
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,667
I see hard times ahead

99
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:54,176
Mr. And Mrs. Ching, why not let
your girl be a songstress

100
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,941
There are famous masters in Fu Shan

101
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,348
If she gets famous
the family can be proud

102
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,346
I've already taken the deposit

103
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,352
Mother

104
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,014
No, don't sell me off Man Fai

105
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,181
Mom, I beg you

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,521
Trust me, mom won't sell you off

107
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,686
Man Fai, how dare you How dare you eardrop on us

108
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,697
Grandma, I beg you I don't want to sing

109
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,228
Take her to her room

110
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:17,695
Calm down

111
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,027
What'll we do now

112
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,739
Wo Madam

113
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,208
How dare you Who said you could take her out

114
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,539
You want the whole world to know she's blind

115
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,876
You want the whole family to be a laughing stock

116
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,987
Madam, it's my fault I didn't
know what's best for Miss Man Fai

117
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,886
But, Madam
Please don't sell
her off to Fu Shan,

118
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:40,718
Enough...

119
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,551
Madam, I better go

120
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:52,397
Mom, I beg you Silly girl
be good, come on, sit down

121
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,868
You shouldn't have done that
You mustn't contradict grandma

122
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,405
Grandma will be very angry
Don't sell me off please

123
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,404
I promise I won't

124
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,740
Am I a burden to you

125
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,250
Why does grandma hate me so much

126
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,254
She is the head of the family...

127
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,418
She can be kind

128
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:22,431
Just like...
When I married you dad,

129
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,129
She drank my tea minutes
after I knelt down

130
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,274
Sure, many brides had to
kneel much longer

131
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,777
Mom, I am scared

132
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,447
I am afraid you and dad
will dump me sooner or later

133
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:48,450
Man Fai, Iwill take care
of you as long as I live

134
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,620
I just worry that
we would die before you

135
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,959
You'll be all alone

136
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,166
I only hope we can outlive you...

137
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,800
so you'll always be taken care of

138
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:05,803
Mom

139
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,477
I must have done something
bad in my previous life

140
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,177
Your misfortune is my punishment

141
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,988
Look, how bright is the moon

142
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,862
It's just like the
Mid Autumn Festival

143
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:37,175
Wo, what were the street
kids saying today

144
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,173
They didn't mean anything

145
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,505
No, mother also said
something about punishment

146
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,513
Why am I blind

147
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,342
I don't know

148
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,178
Yes you do No, I don't

149
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,183
You brought me up, Wo...
Right

150
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,685
So, you must know

151
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:54,315
I... I do, but I can't tell you

152
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,689
If I tell you
your grandma will be mad at me

153
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,524
No, she won't, please tell me

154
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,028
If I tell you
don't hold it against your parents

155
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,703
I won't

156
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,067
You weren't blind when you were born

157
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:19,708
You looked so lovely
You loved staring at the lights

158
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:28,058
When you were 6 months' old
your mom took you to hometown

159
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:34,560
One day, your eyes
got all blood shot

160
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:40,570
Your mom took you to
a local herbal doctor

161
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,367
Don't worry, just a ﬂu

162
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,544
Drop 6 times a day
She will recover in 4 days

163
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,153
Man Fai...

164
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,419
What's the matter

165
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,590
Look, her eyes Man Fai

166
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,598
Bring her to the doctor at once

167
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,837
Doctor, how is she

168
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,100
What's wrong with her eyes

169
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,773
The optical nerves were all damaged

170
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,274
She wouldn't be able to see anymore

171
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,109
Man Fai...

172
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,949
Had I died then, mom wouldn't be so miserable now

173
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,449
You're being silly

174
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:32,114
I mean it If I die, everyone will be happier

175
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,192
If you die, I'll be shattered

176
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:37,959
Wo

177
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,522
Why do you love me so much

178
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,966
I owed you in my previous life

179
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,627
What's previous life

180
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,467
Previous life is...
previous life

181
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:56,346
B... I... R... D... Bird

182
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,279
How many new words
have you learnt

183
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:03,486
Brother taught me
ﬂower and bird

184
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,454
What

185
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:09,983
I am so happy

186
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,529
Let's see

187
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,656
It weights a tael

188
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,658
A present from my boss

189
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,673
Lucky you, a gold chain on
your little master's birthday,

190
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,335
may he have many birthdays then
Yeah

191
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:30,171
And not like Wo, stuck with
that blind girl for good

192
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,147
I am not called Blind Girl
I have a name

193
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,352
Miss Man Fai, good morning

194
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,185
Wo said she is happy with me around

195
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,894
Wo is getting old, she can't
take care of you forever

196
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,428
Without her, you will be miserable

197
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,528
My mom said...

198
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,533
You folks will die, your brothe
and sister will get married

199
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,035
My dad will buy me a house
I can live off the rent

200
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,469
In time of war
a house can be tombed out

201
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,199
Money will depreciate

202
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,367
And you can get sick too

203
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,705
Accept it, it's your fate

204
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,378
Your grandma is right, why not...

205
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,541
I want to study, I want to
make a living on my own

206
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,651
I want to study

207
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,185
Leave her alone
she won't understand

208
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,722
I worry about Wo What a weird
child she is serving

209
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,364
I go to school

210
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:33,569
S-C-H-O-O-L School

211
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,744
So Still not working

212
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,749
Stay still...
Why doesn't it work

213
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,045
Got it

214
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,413
Miss Man Fai
I got some newspaper for you

215
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,257
Little master, do you want to
get the station in Philippines

216
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,089
No, he wants to get the radio in Shanghai

217
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,754
Really But it's far
we're in Canton

218
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,928
They're pretty

219
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,169
This is from Hong Kong

220
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,761
These are for you

221
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,095
Thank you, mom

222
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,339
This is for Man Fai

223
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,169
It's nice

224
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,273
What color is it Red

225
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,278
Is it a happy color

226
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,609
Red is happier than pink

227
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,945
Hold on, keep this for her cousin,

228
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,780
wouldn't matter
what colour for Man Fai

229
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,286
Come on
keep that for Man Fai

230
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:21,588
We don't want it
save it for others

231
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,461
Who do you think you are
Queen of the maids

232
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,326
Think you're grandma

233
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,461
Wo, don't be angry

234
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,732
Why are you laughing

235
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:41,305
Your mom said, Who do you think
you are My mother-in-law

236
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,142
What's that like

237
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:48,481
Wo, you're so nice, were you
blind in your previous life

238
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,810
Madam

239
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,625
You're right, keep this for Man Fai

240
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:02,156
Man Fai, I'll get the tailor to
make you some new clothes

241
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,824
Thank you, mom

242
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,835
Got it... I've got it

243
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,110
How is it

244
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,199
Come on...

245
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,375
What are they doing

246
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,880
They are dancing

247
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,212
I want to dance too

248
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,900
Brother, sister...

249
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,110
Dad What are you doing

250
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,914
Man Fai, come with me
we're taking you out

251
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,249
Let me come with Miss Man Fai

252
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,088
You stay Dad

253
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,423
What are you doing
Where are you taking her

254
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,124
What's this You think
lam going to sell her

255
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,101
Will this work

256
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,609
I hope so, the doctor is from England

257
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,216
He may have a cure

258
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,608
How is it, doctor

259
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,923
The tissue of her eyeballs
are totally damaged

260
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,620
Can that be cured

261
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,785
We are testing comeas transplant

262
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:11,952
But it's not yet fool-proof

263
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,289
Rickshaw man

264
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,527
Go back with Man Fai ﬁrst

265
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,568
I've got work in the ofﬁce

266
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,301
Be careful...

267
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,471
Dad Thank you

268
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,078
But the doctor said you
couldn't be cured

269
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,848
I know, and I know you care

270
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:40,981
Go

271
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,994
Stop...

272
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,332
Man Fai, what's the matter

273
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,533
Mom, listen

274
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,604
What is this place

275
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,843
Pui Tao Girls School

276
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,848
Look at the blackboard

277
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,844
What is blackboard

278
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,189
Teacher writes on blackboard with chalk

279
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:18,289
I want to go to school, I want to learn

280
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,525
Child, it's no use

281
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,331
You can't read from the blackboard

282
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,031
You can never go to school

283
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,733
Mom, I promise

284
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,879
I will never mention about studying again

285
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,938
Move, please

286
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,856
P-A-I-N-T-I-N-G. ..

287
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,057
Miss Man Fai, let's go...

288
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,195
No, I haven't ﬁnished my lesson

289
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,894
Go home now Come on

290
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,736
Are there delinquents around

291
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,397
No, let's go...

292
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,402
Go...

293
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,906
What's up Go

294
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,713
What's the matter
Oh my shoe

295
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,816
Sit down
I will ﬁnd a shoe smith to mend it

296
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,091
Here is a whistle

297
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:26,928
If anyone bully you, blow it

298
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,796
The police will hear you and
I will hear you Understand

299
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,095
I will be right back

300
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,433
Miss Man Fai

301
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,935
Stop, I am a good man

302
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,672
I like Wo very much

303
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,278
I am the meat vendor

304
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,443
Wo comes to the market everyday

305
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,714
Over time, I got fond of her

306
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,083
She... She has this spell on me

307
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,957
Miss Man Fai, Wo loves you very much

308
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,224
Say something nice about me
in front of her

309
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,124
She is coming back

310
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,631
Miss Man Fai, please help me

311
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,830
The name is Kan, thank you

312
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,136
Miss, it's ﬁxed, put it back on

313
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,805
Are you alright
I am ﬁne

314
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,139
Let's go then

315
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,980
If we're late, grandma will ﬁnd out
Let's go...

316
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,526
It's late, go to bed

317
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,164
It's only 10:30

318
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,063
WoWhy didn't we have pork tonight

319
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,165
I wasn't in the mood to buy any today

320
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,569
Do you want portk

321
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,077
No, but the pork wishes you to buy it

322
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,018
What did that good-for-nothing say

323
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,519
He didn't say anything to me

324
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,453
Don't you try lying

325
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,022
He said he misses you every day
and you drive him crazy

326
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,857
Nonsense Tell him to drop dead

327
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,765
Do you ever think of getting married

328
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,027
If I wish to get married,

329
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,535
I would have married years ago

330
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,402
There was a famine in my village
We were starving

331
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:22,946
For money, my step mother forced
me into this marriage

332
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,676
Only my husband turned out to be...

333
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,699
I escaped Canton to be a maid

334
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,199
I swear I would never marry

335
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:50,001
And I don't want to leave you

336
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,445
Even if you get married
I will go with you

337
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,972
I won't marry, let's never marry

338
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,077
This one... that one is better

339
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,653
Whatever you say

340
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,245
What would you like

341
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,092
Wo, whatever you want, you get

342
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,251
No, what do you want

343
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,419
I want you

344
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,756
Listen, leave me alone

345
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,993
I chatted with you before...

346
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,899
just to get a better
bargain from you

347
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,265
Stop dreaming

348
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,429
I won't get married

349
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,077
Alright So be it

350
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,511
Wo, what's that singing

351
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,820
here is a girl over there
she is blind, too

352
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,327
Miss Man Fai, what's up

353
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,166
Mister, Madam, I've sung two songs

354
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,208
Have pity on me

355
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,175
I just want thirty cents

356
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:38,009
If I don't get it
my master will scold me

357
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,674
Mister, I beg you...
Get lost

358
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,953
Wo, do you have thirty cents
Give it to her

359
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,556
Alright, Here Forty cents

360
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,852
Thank you Madam

361
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,857
I am just a maid

362
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,120
Thank you Madam Maid

363
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,160
Are you alright

364
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,025
She is Miss Man Fai

365
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,856
Thank you Madam Miss

366
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,126
What's your name

367
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm Blind Girl

368
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,032
No, you're not

369
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,034
Don't ever let others
call you Blind Girl

370
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,038
Although we can't see...

371
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,473
we can't let others call
us Blind Girl

372
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,314
Us Give me your hand

373
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,283
No, 40 cents are plenty for me

374
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:20,119
Come on, we're the same
Show her your hand

375
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:27,257
Why's your hand so cold
Are you sick

376
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,335
I haven't eaten for two days

377
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,404
It's raining, let's go over there

378
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:41,906
Follow me, be careful, follow me

379
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,044
Come over here... Hold the tree

380
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,244
Wo, go get something for her to eat

381
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,681
Alright, don't leave here

382
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,421
Why are you afraid
It's just raining

383
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,384
What's your name

384
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,617
I was called Jade

385
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,894
When I was ﬁve
I became blind after a fever

386
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,857
My dad said a blind person is useless

387
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,863
So he never called me Jade

388
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:04,932
You have a dad

389
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,759
Not anymore

390
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:12,104
I remembered that day, my dad
took me to Canton by train

391
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,845
After we got off
he had me walk in front of him

392
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,443
Without him in front I kept falling

393
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,785
He didn't help me
just told me to keep walking

394
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,280
We walked for hours

395
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:31,255
Then dad said he would get me
food and asked me to wait

396
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,795
He told me not to move

397
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:36,229
OthenNise the police would
take me to feed the tigers

398
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,457
I was so scared

399
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,931
Then he went off

400
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,569
It was raining heavily
just like now

401
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:53,176
I stood there
I dared not move nor speak

402
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,377
I waited and waited

403
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,924
At last, I fainted

404
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,159
My dad never came back

405
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,666
Come on, have some cake Go on

406
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,303
My master adopted me and
taught me to sing

407
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,498
Madam Miss

408
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,640
Jade, just call me Man Fai

409
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,074
I wish I would be half as lucky as you

410
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,512
Wo, the rain has stopped
let's take Jade home for dinner

411
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:33,419
No, if master and madam ﬁnd out
I'd be in trouble

412
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,353
You can think of a way

413
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,518
What way
I know you can

414
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,521
No way...
You can... Let's go

415
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,196
Man Fai, it's not good

416
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,529
How dare you not be earning your living
You're so useless

417
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,510
Stop that

418
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:53,775
What do you want

419
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:59,540
Miss likes her singing, so we asked
her to stay, So what

420
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,712
Master... Here are 40 cents
40 cents

421
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:09,324
And, we want her to sing for
our family tomorrow

422
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,088
If she sings well, she will get paid well

423
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,225
Sure, she will come tomorrow...
tomorrow

424
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,474
Jade... Jade...

425
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,446
Be careful

426
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,577
Keep your voice down
Jade...

427
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,085
Go inside ﬁrst, go in

428
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,384
Take Jade to my room
Don't let them ﬁnd out

429
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,094
Come on, Jade, go to my room

430
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,594
MomYou scared me to death

431
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,925
You scared me to death
What's going on

432
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,436
Wo, who is she

433
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,431
She is... She is a beggar

434
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,600
Miss Man Fai took pity
on her, so... How dare you

435
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,837
Don't send her away
she is my friend

436
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,143
Fﬁend
My very ﬁrst friend

437
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,315
Well... Wo, give her a bath ﬁrst

438
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,955
Alright Go now

439
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,020

Wo, give my happy pink dress to her
Alright

442
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,292
Where is Grandma

443
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,125
She went to the temple
won't be back until tomorrow

444
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,303
Go to the kitchen
get something for her to eat

445
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,963
Thank you, madam

446
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,301
You're a good girl

447
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,134
Come on, I will take you to the garden

448
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,451
WoMark the cutlery that she used

449
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,987
Don't mix up with ours
Yes

450
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:50,283
And... next time when she comes
let her use the marked ones

451
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,296
Yes, Madam Don't forget

452
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,260
Yes

453
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,492
Here is the table, Jade
sit down

454
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,332
Miss Man Fai, have some fruit

455
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,634
I'll leave you two
Alright

456
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,668
Jade, have an apple

457
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,345
I never have apple before

458
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,675
It's delicious

459
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,177
It's got skin

460
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,685
Never mind, you can eat that too
it's nutritious

461
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:20,854
Delicious

462
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,086
Yes

463
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,361
Starting from tomorrow,I'll teach
you English point alphabet

464
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,528
No, I don't know English at all

465
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,701
Why don't I teach you sing
it's easier

466
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,201
Once you learn to sing others will
want you to sing for money

467
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,275
I won't sing in front of other people

468
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,309
I want to study, it's safer

469
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,446
Only ifl sing well will I be safe

470
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,710
I need to beg, so my master won't beat me

471
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,186
Be brave, I will teach you
a point alphabet each day

472
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,988
Let's do this
From tomorrow onwards,

473
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,891
I work hard in singing

474
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,192
And you work hard in studying

475
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,469
What's wrong

476
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,095
I swallowed a seed

477
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,907
It doesn't matter, it's tiny

478
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,073
You ate the skin too

479
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,580
Poor thing Your tongue must be sore

480
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,249
I don't know

481
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,416
It's lychee

482
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,617
I'm so sorry Jade

483
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,318
Never mind, it's delicious too

484
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,592
Only it's a very big seed

485
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,498
What took you so long

486
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,495
Blind Girl, where are you going

487
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:43,763
Blind Girl, where are you going

488
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,170
Just shut your mouth

489
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,511
You'd be blamed

490
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,440
We are going to

Miss Man Fai, let's get out

497

498
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,595
Thirty cents, keep the change

499
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,740

00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:57,746

They read too fast, I can't catch up

512
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,694
It's incredible You know so many English words

513
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,736
Every night, my brother &amp
sister would teach me English

514
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,368
What about English point alphabet
They won't know that

515
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:29,870
It's God God granted it to me

516
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,203
I mean it

517

534
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,361
But only America has schools for the blind

535
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,601
Brother, is America very far away

536

Yeah, but we should still try

537

Yes, God will show us a miracle

538
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:34,843
What's this

539
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:35,943
It's the Bible

00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,462

555
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,124
I can't cure your sister's illness

556
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:25,318
But I can write to USA &amp

00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:36,369
Ground Floor, Number 18
Wai Oi Road, West

560
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,405
Who wants to open it

562
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:44,511
Go ahead

563
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,681
It's so tightly wrapped

564
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,351
Sure, the sender is a doctor, isn't he

565
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,679
Professional practice, that's all

566
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:50,683
Let me help

567
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,588
What is this

568
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,722
Just like a carrot slicer

569
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,129
It's got many tiny holes on it

570
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,796
Also an awl and a wooden pad

571
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,196
And a card too

572
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,005
With English letters on the card

573
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,770
They are all pointed alphabets

574
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,876
For two &amp; three, there are 6 marks
for four, there are 7 marks

575
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,379
I got it Me too I don't

576
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:23,285
The blind can't see, but they can touch

577
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:27,380
But they are pointed

578
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:28,889
What an idea

579
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,060
Miss Man Fai

580
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:41,034
You scared me, where have you been

581
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,332
Wo, she is Miss Leung

582
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,403
Ching Man Fai, I'll do my best to
get our principal's consent...

583
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,169
for you to study in this school

584
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,069
But, you may have a hard time

585
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,079
I am not afraid of that
Me too

586
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,444
Miss Leung, if you are willing
to teach her,

587
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,245
I will worship you like kitchen god

588
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,081
Is she really that nice Yes

589
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,020
Let me tell dad and mom

590
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:04,754
No

591
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,426
Why

592
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,656
They won't agree

593
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,257
Dad won't let me study, the school fee is expensive

594
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:15,269
Miss Man Fai, don't worry

595
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,770
I will pray for you, alright

596
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,431
Can you pray for me

597
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,837
Sure

598
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,841
I know God better

599
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,607
You tell me, and I tell him
that's alright

600
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,581
Do you remember last time

601
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,652
We prayed and you learnt
point alphabets

602
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,117
Sister, will God love a blind too

603
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,491
Sure For God love all of us

604
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,126
Did the Bible say why some
of us are blind

605
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,537
Is it because I did something
wrong in my previous life

606
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,299
Isn't it

607
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,809
Wait, let me read the Bible now

608
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,816
It's mentioned here, listen

609
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:08,092
Jesus said the blind didn't
commit any sins

610
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,160
Their parents didn't commit
any sins either

611
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:14,697
But God wants to show the
glory of God through them

612
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,322
What's the glory of God

613
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,335
Give me a minute

614
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,012
Mother Master, Madam

615
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:31,978
What's the matter

616
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:32,979
You'd better ask her

617
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:37,142
Wo Did you bring a blind girl
to play with Man Fai everyday

618
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,683
Speak up

619
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,351
Not everyday, just a few days

620
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,514
Who told you to do that

621
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:43,785
This is not her fault

622
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,189
So, is this your fault

623
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,685
This is my fault

624
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,196
I brought her to see Miss Man Fai

625
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,998
What made you do so

626
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,363
I just want her to know more friend

627
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,766
You asked a beggar to be her friend

628
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,034
The neighbours are all
laughing behind our backs

629
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,042
Wo, were you blind in your previous life

630
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,680
Why are you always protecting the blind

631
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,576
Ask Man Fai to come out

632
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,942
She has gone to her friend

633
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,714
The blind girl again

634
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,876
No, a new friend

635
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,215
She went by himself

636
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,551
No, she went with her brother and sister

637
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,056
What new friend

638
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,622
A foreigner

639
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,922
What foreigner

640
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,828
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ

641
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:23,893
Yes

642
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,227
Oh my God

643
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,897
She goes to church to pray
for Jesus's help

644
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:31,905
What

645
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,907
To bless her and make her
hope come true

646
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,568
What hope

647
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,442
Is Ching Man Fai here

648
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,976
I'm looking for Ching Man Fai

649
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,752
God loves me

650
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,954
What took you so long

651
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,049
That teacher from Pui Tao
Girls School was just here

652
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,593
She agreed to let Man Fai study
for three months

653
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,255
Is that true Oh my God

654
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,264
God loves me...

655
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,598
Bible always tells us...

656
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,970
Dad, please let me study

657
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,706
This is a rare chance

658
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,176
You can't see, you can't read
from the blackboard

659
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,580
How can you catch up

660
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,450
I can be her tutor at night

661
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,954
I can read the books to her

662
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,959
So what She is still blind

663
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:25,618
Grandma

664
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:29,229
She should have gone to learn singing

665
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,199
Dad, I beg you

666
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,298
Dad, let Man Fai go to school

667
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,300
Please let Man Fai study

668
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,038
Why can't you understand

669
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,903
Inﬂation is spiralling
My boss already left here for good

670
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,103
I may soon be jobless
you still want to study

671
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,839
I don't have money for you to study

672
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,579
Master I have money

673
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:58,855
Master, I think this should be
enough for her to graduate

674
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,922
Where have you got so much money

675
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,831
You must have cheated from
the grocery expense

676
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:08,665
This is my entire saving in 20 years

677
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,003
I want it to be Miss Man Fai's dowry

678
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,340
I think it's better
to let her study, right

679
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,928
Miss Man Fai What's wrong

680
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,870
Hush Hush, don't cry

681
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,212
Miss Man Fai is going to school

682
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,210
In the future
if you want to do anything

683
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,684
Just go ahead if you think it's right

684
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,722
I will support you always

685
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,056
Be good

686
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,334
Have you seen Jade
Tell her the good news

687
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,601
How come no answer

688
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,070
Jade and her master live here

689
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,268
Just call out loud

690
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:26,949
Jade...

691
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,249
Jade

692
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,045
Hey

693
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,116
Hey what I have a name

694
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,383
The blind girl left already

695
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,415
Where did she go Hey you

696
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:38,917
Miss Wo

697
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,830
Brother Kan, where have they gone

698
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,098
One-eye Ying took her to Kwangsi

699
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,963
They left minutes ago

700
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,597
Go chase them

701
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,604
It's all your fault
Why were you so nice to her

702
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,436
One-eye Ying was afraid of losing Jade

703
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,113
Your good intention hurts Jade more

704
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,952
Hurry up Hurry up...

705
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,789
Jade

706
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,458
Miss Man Fai, there they are

707
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:21,960
Jade...

708
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:39,446
We can't catch them up

709
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,674
Miss Leung
Good morning
Come on, Man Fai

710
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,378
Miss Man Fai School bag

711
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,190
Teacher is coming, back to your seat

712
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:30,633
Stand up Bow Sit down

713
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,539
Lesson six, turn to page 49

714
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,945
We are going to learn a poem

715
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,689
Pay attention to the blackboard
I'll write the name of the poet

716
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,564
This lesson is over, raise your
hand if you have a question

717
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,402
Look, her eyes are disgusting

718
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,071
Yeah, it's watery

719
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,581
How can she study in our school

720
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,447
Don't be nosy, let's go

721
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:19,317
Hello

722
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:23,381
I sit behind you
and your head block my sight

723
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:24,585
Can we switch seats...

724
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,127
since you can't see

725
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,963
Man Fai, you are back

726
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,600
Grandma, dad, mom

727
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,603
Can you follow the lessons

728
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,870
Yes, the lessons are ﬁne

729
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:45,943
How about your classmates

730
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,743
They are all very nice to me

731
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:48,610
Tell us more

732
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,946
Come on, tell us more

733
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:52,956
I am really happy

734
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:57,753
I understand everything the teacher said
the classmate are nice

735
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:02,557
They teach me mathematics
we play together during recess

736
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,427
They all sit around me

737
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,633
Miss Man Fai

738
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,135
I am really scared

739
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,172
I don't know how big
the classroom is

740
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,144
I worry I would mistake
another's seat as mine

741
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,374
Without you, I don't know
what is around

742
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,984
They said I could never
catch up with them

743
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,085
They all treat me as a blind peron

744
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,658
Miss, have you forgotten
your old friend

745
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,322
Who

746
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,431
Jesus Christ

747
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,396
I really hope he would be with me

748
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:43,531
He is a VIP He is busy

749
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:47,303
He always go here and there
right

750
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:54,282
And he said, you've to
solve your own problems

751
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,078
What can I do

752
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:01,454
Tomorrow, go and chat
with your classmates

753
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:06,925
If you are nice to them
they wouldn't reject you

754
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:10,892
They said my eyes were watery
and awful looking

755
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,370
Wait

756
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:23,205
Miss Man Fai, be careful... Sit...

757
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,274
Don't move, try this on, don't move

758
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,916
What's this

759
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,016
It is wonderful

760
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,348
It is your dad's sunglasses

761
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:38,889
Wear it, and you'll look different
Really

762
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,656
Yeah, wear this tomorrow

763
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,733
Pretend you can see them...

764
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,962
but they can't see you

765
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:52,734
Since they can't see your eyes
they won't look down on you, Right

766
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,733
May be

767
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:01,582
Miss, actually you're very pretty

768
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,250
No

769
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:08,418
You see, kindness is what counts

770
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:12,926
Kind people are the best looking people

771
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,630
Wo, you're so kind, you must be pretty

772
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,594
Miss Man Fai, remember what I told you...

773
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,180
I am Ching Man Fai, can I play with you

774
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,658

War again

778
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,527
What is the 8th Route Army

779
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,268
Students, go back to the classrooms

780
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,100
What's liberation

781
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,165
Go back to classrooms

782
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,343
No, I can't act No

783
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,003
Don't be afraid, you don't have to move

784
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,170
Just sit and be the king

785
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,748
Yeah, you only have to sit

786
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,952
That's pretty

787
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,687
Alright, let's rehearse

788
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,189
In front of His Majesty
I testify against your crime

789
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,089
Alright, let's have a duel in front
of His Majesty Come on

790
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:56,631
Do I have to say any line

791
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,361
That hurts

792
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:00,525
I didn't mean it

793
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,270
This is for real

794
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,867
Stop...

795
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,874
Are you rehearsing or not

796
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,311
In the name of the Emperor
I order you to stop ﬁghting

797
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,080
Attention, attention...

798

Since the situation may
become unstable,

799
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,049
the school will be closed
until further notice

800
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:27,026
All students should go
home immediately

801
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,219
It's war

802
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:29,224
What'll we do

803
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,891
How am I to go home

804
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,896
Students, civil war has
spread to Canton

805
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,063
Air attack may be launch any time

Man Fai, pack up quickly

822
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,790
Take only the important
things with you

823
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,553
We are leaving, follow us

824
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:33,592
Forget the books

825
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:34,957
Wo, take her with you

826
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,963
No, I've to take my books
to Hong Kong

827
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,326
You can't We don't have
any empty space

828
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,667
My homework, where is my homework

829
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:44,963
Be careful...

830
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,138
I will take it for you

831
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,976
Man Fai, here is your homework
I am taking it for you

832
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,405
Thank you, brother

833
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,218
Miss, how are you

834
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,613
I feel dizzy

835
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,152
Just hang on, let's go

836
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,422
Let me help you, be careful

837
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,648
Be careful, walk slowly

838
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,439
The job interview, how did it go

839
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,907
What are you doing

840
00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,473
What's the matter

841
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,608
Pawn it

842
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,049
Let's eat...

843
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,057
I think embroidery
work suits me better

844
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,559
Recruiting female worker

845
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,036
Yes Half day work
is available too

846
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,034
Really Yes
you can also work from home

847
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,639
Yes, it's easier for
a woman to ﬁnd ajob

848
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,074
Look at that vacancy

849
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:39,313
This is the most I could
get from the pawn shop

850
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,484
Miss Man Fai, what are you doing

851
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,456
Typing ajob application for brother

852
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,085
Wo

853
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,693
The three of us have decided...

854
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:52,761
Sit down ﬁrst

855
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,434
I prefer to stand, Madam

856
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:55,768
Sit

857
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,236
I prefer to stand

858
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,474
You know how things have been

859
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,270
Yes

860
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,709
We don't have money to pay you...

861
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,108
I didn't say you've to pay me

862
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,977
But we have to pay for your food

863
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,114
Grandma, don't ask Wo to go

864
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,620
I rather not studying

865
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,816
You think this is my idea
Your dad wouldn't say it

866
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,790
That's why I had to say it

867
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,254
Madam, I just got a job in the factory

868
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,933
We can use my salary for the family...

869
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,332
...just so I can take care of
Miss Man Fai,

870
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,631
I mean this from my heart

871
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:30,636
Wo

872
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,869
Madam, I really mean what I said

873
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,735
please let me stay

874
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,505
We can't owe you wage forever

875
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,044
Sooner or later, you'll
get used to it, Master,

876
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,808
I really don't mind

877
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:48,822
I'll send you to school before work

878
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,153
I'll bring you lunch at noon

879
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,762
And I'll pick you up at night

880
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,491
That's too much

881
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:57,993
It doesn't matter, I can handle it

882
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,533
Here we are Sit down and eat

883
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,701
You used your own money
to buy me food, didn't you

884
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,271
I know what I'm doing

885
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,544
You're lucky to study
in such a famous school

886
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,042
Now eat

887
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,883
Oh, I just learned Chinese
point characters

888
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:51,713
Really

889
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,753
So, it'll be easier to take notes

890
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:54,582
That's good

891
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,217
What's wrong with your hand

892
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,886
It's nothing Wo, you've some too

894

You eat, or the food will
get cold Eat now

00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,553
Let me wash, go out please, Master

899
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,097
Wo, keep this as a record
of what I owed you

900
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,098
I don't want it

901
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,066
Keep it Master, I don't want it

902

00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,737

905
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,908

Man Ching Miss Man Ching

00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:07,828
Doctor, how is she

911
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,296
She's got nephritis
you should prepare for the worse

912
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,969
But she is so young

913
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,298
Sister

914
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:23,643
Sister

915
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,176

00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,117

937
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,568
Composition Free topic

938
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,242
Ifl can see this world

939
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,606
I will be surprised by so many colors

940
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:12,646
I used to think wind is white

941
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:14,890
Happiness is red, and sadness black

942
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,415
I hate green the most

943
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,727
Cause I know green herbs made me blind

944
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,700
But, green is pretty

945
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:30,130
Green grass, green trees

946
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,867
Red ﬂower

947
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,009
White cloud

948
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:36,337
Blue sky

949
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,749
Where're dad and mom

950
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:49,015
They are down the hill
they won't come up

951
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,394
They can't bear to see their child go

952
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,660
Burn this for Miss Man Ching

953
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:28,957
Sister, see you

954
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:30,931
You've my word

955
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:45,973
Stop, stay still

956
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:48,313
Quiet

957
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,507
What is this place

958
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:50,812
Want some music

959
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,920
Are you making radio again, brother

960
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,090
I've no money to buy parts
But this'll do

961
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,521
What's that

962
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:02,062
It is the only radio station in
Hong Kong, they charge a fee

963
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,167
This welfare center is a subscriber, understand

964
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,063
Brother, don't Don't take it apart

965
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,868
If you break it, we can't pay them back

966
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,304
You underestimate me

967
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,535
Don't be afraid, all we need
is to hook up this wire

968
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,485
Do you like it

969
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,989
Yes, I haven't listened
to radio for ages

970
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,021
Let's dance

971
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:38,893
Man Fai, what's the matter

972
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,495
I thought of sister

973
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,300
Try not to think too much

974
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,104
After today, I won't play
with radio anymore

975
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,880
Help me to sit down

976
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,081
I will get ajob to support our family

977
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,119
No one will admit dad's qualiﬁcation

978
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,490
So it is difﬁcult for dad to ﬁnd work

979
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,824
Have dad and mom aged a lot

980
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,534
Yes, mom looks so broken

981
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,604
That's why I won't play with radio any more

982
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,001
I will quit studying

983
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,769
No You're the only one going to school now

984
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,171
You must work hard

985
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:27,112
You give up so much for me to study...

986
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:28,113
Man Fai, don't say that

987
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:33,322
I promise, I will work hard
and be somebody

988
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,115
We'll all work hard together
alright

989
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,097
Let's play dwarfs, come on

990
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:57,468
Where are we now

991
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,645
We're at a British army barrack

992
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,117
They're hiring workers
for their Iaundramat

993
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,752
It's good working hours
And pay well

994
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:05,981
Come over here

995
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:07,989
Stay here, wait for me

996
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,314
Who speaks English
I need someone who speaks English

997
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:11,990
Ido

998
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:18,327
Flower and bird I am very good

999
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,833
You're OK OK

1000
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,432
OK, follow me

1001
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,164
What's going on

1002
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,604
Miss Man Fai, wait for me
right here Alright

1003
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,085
Jade

1004
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,508
Jade... Jade

1005
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,699
What's the matter

1006
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,470
This isn't a playground

1007
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,702
It's your turn to record

1008
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:05,540
Thank you

1009
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:06,704
Let's go inside

1010
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,375
Do you know Jade Why do you know this song

1011
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,714
Every blind person would know this song

1012
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,191
Your time is up, time to die

1013
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,723
Spare me

1014
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,397
I can't breathe

1015
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,057
You're dead meat, my boy

1016
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,368
Please, I just escaped from prison

1017
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,000
Please let me go

1018
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,078
Please let me go home

1019
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,545
You really think you can go back alive

1020
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,748
I'll strangle you with this chain

1021
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,144
Stop, set the kid free

1022
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,416
Kid, you'll die

1023
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,559
Let him go

1024
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,092
I got a whistle, I will get police

1025
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,490
What's she doing here

1026
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:55,924
Go away

1027
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,692
I got someone outside
he's tougher than you

1028
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,336
Kiddo Did you kill him

1029
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,346
Mom, mom...

1030
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:14,377
I am alright, mom

1031
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:15,981
Mom

1032
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,622
Dear listeners, has David
Copperﬁeld escaped from danger

1033
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,784
And what hatred is between
the prisoner and him

1034
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,793
How will the story end

1035
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:32,123
Please tune in at same time
tomorrow, good bye

1036
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:35,729
What happened

1037
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,236
Where did David Copperﬁeld
ﬁnd a mother

1038
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:42,039
I couldn't think of anything else

1039
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,146
Who are you Do you know
we were on air just now

1040
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,410
Who let her in

1041
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,809
I am so sorry...

1042
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,083
You think of a way out
for tomorrow's show

1043
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:57,815
Sorry

1044
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,159
Did I scare you

1045
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,764
Don't you know this
is a radio station

1046
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:03,829
Radiusion

1047
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:05,828
You are

1048
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,435
I do radio plays

1049
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:08,667
Listen

1050
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:12,168
Miss, I'm gonna kill you

1051
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,373
I'm here, are you scared

1052
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:19,838
I'm here, are you scared

1053
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:21,845
Sister

1054
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,348
I don't know your sister's voice, I can't mimick that

1055
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,182
Miss Man Fai, you scared me Wo

1056
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,854
How come you're here

1057
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,686
Does he look like sister

1058
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,230
He is a young man

1059
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:36,695
Let's go

1060
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:40,693
Why did you come here
I had to look for you all over

1061
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:41,700
Let's go home

1062
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,232
Miss...

1063
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:46,534
Oh, it's you

1064
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,370
Yes, I am Lam Yu

1065
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,808
My sister's spirit was speaking
through you, right

1066
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,176
Are you kidding

1067
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:54,876
You forgot your whistle

1068
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,547
Thank you
Thank you, Mr. Lam

1069
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,380
You're welcome

1070
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:01,720
I am Ching Man Fai

1071
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,553
That was easy work, washing clothes

1072
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:09,527
Really

1073
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,730
And I made ten dollars

1074
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:14,892
I'll buy you some snacks later

1075
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,917
All these biblical stories you know

1076
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,921
My sister told me those

1077
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,591
Don't miss her so much

1078
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,252
I am sure she's gone to heaven

1079
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,254
Let's go to a movie some day

1080
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:45,932
I mean listen to a movie

1081
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,600
You'll feel better
if you learn more stories

1082
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,433
Did I mess up your radio play

1083
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:57,273
It's alright, I came up
with a perfect explanation

1084
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:58,708
How

1085
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,678
The woman became very angry
with David Copperﬁeld

1086
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,308
She said, You lied
I ain't married,

1087
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,284
how can I be your mother

1088
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,356
I don't care if you get
killed or not, I'm leaving

1089
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:10,954
That's it

1090
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,321
If Wo heard that
she would have laughed to death

1091
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,888
Has she taken care of you for long

1092
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:18,956
Yes

1093
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:20,958
I keep thinking...

1094
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,305
It may be my misfortune to be blind

1095
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:28,674
But my biggest fortune is having Wo with me

1096
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,575
She spent all her savings on me

1097
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,549
She is 50 years old

1098
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,984
But she brings me lunch everyday

1099
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,155
She wouldn't even take the bus
just to save money for me

1100
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:48,996
And she moonlights at home
to make more money

1101
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,494
It seems we are destined
to be together

1102
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:56,463
She gives and I receive

1103
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,969
I don't know how I can
ever repay her

1104
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,001
Mr. Lam
How are you

1105
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,338
Miss Man Fai, let's go

1106
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:17,292
Miss Man Fai, that Mr.
Lam seems a nice chap

1107
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:22,022
He is handsome too

1108
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:26,026
Oh, Miss Man Fai is embarrassed

1109
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,528
No, I ain't

1110
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,695
Don't deny it, you face is all red

1111
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,366
Wo

1112
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:40,038
Reverend, here are
Man Fai's qualiﬁcations

1113
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:44,910
Good, I'll send these to Pakins
School for the Blind in USA

1114
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,045
See whether they will grant a
scholarship to someone in Hong Kong

1115
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:48,617
Thank you, Reverend

1116
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:52,383
Congratulations for being
recruited by the BBC

1117
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:53,619
Thank you

1118
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,230
You must be leaving soon

1119
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,599
If Man Fai can study in USA
that'll be fantastic

1120
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:01,968
You've done all you can for her

1121
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,496
But, you think she can handle it

1122
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,911
Our neighbour association
would like to employ Miss Man Fai

1123
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:15,073
She's qualiﬁed to teach
the blind point alphabets

1124
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,907
We will pay her well

1125
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:17,882
That's good

1126
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,411
Wo, hurry up

1127
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,084
In time, she'll be promoted
to be instructor

1128
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,092
But Man Fai is

1129
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,628
This isn't a demanding job

1130
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,322
What do you say

1131
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,362
How much can she get a month

1132
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,266
Dad, mom, I've got a scholarship

1133
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,632
I can study in
a university in the USA

1134
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:40,040
What'll we do now

1135
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,439
Miss Man Fai should study in USA

1136
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,942
She should work for a living

1137
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,811
We've supported her long enough

1138
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,509
It's time she help support the family

1139
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:56,289
Master, Miss Man Fai is capable
of much greater things

1140
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,116
I don't know anymore

1141
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,290
Mother

1142
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,623
She can earn $30 per month

1143
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,724
These days
we can barely make ends meet

1144
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:10,837
Madam, we're old
nobody lives forever

1145
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:11,631
Wo, shut up

1146
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:13,440
This whole study business
is all your fault

1147
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,972
You even let her go out
for a movie date tonite

1148
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:18,943
She can't see

1149
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,447
What happens if she falls
in love with that boy

1150
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,151
Mom, she is only a little girl

1151
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,753
If she were lucky, she would
have been happily married already

1152
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,485
If that boy dumps her,

1153
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,320
Man Fai will only get hurt

1154
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,984
Then what

1155
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:36,393
Madam, the boy isn't like that

1156
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,155
So what

1157
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,326
Man Fai is blind
how can there be a good ending

1158
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:42,663
Man Fai

1159
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,162
You been here long

1160
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,171
Yes

1161
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:47,172
They were saying...

1162
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,037
I heard everything

1163
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,013
Don't worry about them
let's go to the movie

1164
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:58,347
Man Fai, I've come to say goodbye

1165
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,120
I leave for an internship
in England tomorrow

1166
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,093
It's very rare to be
able to study abroad

1167
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,962
Therefore you mustn't
give up easily

1168
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,892
Why didn't you tell me
you'd leave soon

1169
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,190
We haven't known each
other for long

1170
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,095
I couldn't say goodbye
right after we met

1171
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,196
Be brave

1172
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,838
Let me see you without
your glasses

1173
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:31,409
Have more conﬁdence
in yourself

1174
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,821
And you won't even
need this anymore

1175
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,384
We'll write each other
won't we

1176
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,187
And send my regards to Wo

1177
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,741
Stop quarrelling
let Man Fai decide for herself

1178
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:02,748
No, she has to work to
make her keep

1179
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:04,715
She has to study in the USA

1180
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,718
You're getting senile
who is the boss here

1181
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,551
You are an old fool
you never think for the children

1182
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:14,254
Man Fai is my grand-daughter
you've no say here

1183
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,421
No, Man Fai is my daughter

1184
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:17,758
I say she must go to the USA

1185
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:20,231
You are so stubborn
beware of God's punishment

1186
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:23,927
Oh, my God...

1187
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,605
Mom

1188
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:32,572
Here are your papers
visa and air ticket

1189
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:35,147
Someone will pick you
up at the airport

1190
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,117
Thank you, Reverend

1191
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:43,221
Can you manage by yourself

1192
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,650
Hasn't God arranged
for everything

1193
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:51,126
Sure Best wishes to you

1194
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:09,148
Miss Man Fai, it's late
what're you doing

1195
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:14,118
Wo, Ifl am not around
what'll happen to you

1196
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,481
It will take a while
to get used to

1197
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,290
I am not going

1198
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:21,586
This letter is to decline
the scholarship

1199
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,988
What

1200
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,100
The scholarship only
allows me to go alone

1201
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,065
How can I just leave you
in Hong Kong

1202
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,905
I can ﬁnd another job
until you come back

1203
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,970
But I can stay here, too

1204
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,974
After high school, I can
work for the blind

1205
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:41,114
No, you must study, you've
to go to USA

1206
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,743
Don't worry about me

1207
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:46,346
Wo

1208
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:51,523
If you go abroad, you'll set
an example for the blind in HK

1209
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,524
They can learn from you

1210
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,761
Remember what you teacher told you

1211
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:00,798
If you fail, the blind in
Hong Kong will fail too

1212
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,861
If you accept this scholarship,

1213
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:07,975
may be they'll grant another
scholarship to other Chinese

1214
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:12,374
After your graduates, you can
teach the other blind people,

1215
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:15,676
so they don't have to rely
on foreign help alone

1216
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,245
Don't back away from this

1217
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:23,116
I'll still be happy, even if
you're not around me

1218
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,860
But how can I live without you

1219
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,724
Learn

1220
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,763
Starting from this minute

1221
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,061
Remember, the objects
and utensils you've used,

1222
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:36,568
just put them back to
where they were before

1223
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:40,902
I've sewed markings onto your clothes

1224
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,567
A pearl means pink

1225
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,508
A cross means white

1226
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:52,114
Remember that and you can
match the clothes yourself

1227
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,986
And, tie the socks
together before washing

1228
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,251
Separate the long ones
from the short ones

1229
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,758
Wo, speak slowly

1230
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:01,725
Alright, I will speak slowly...

1231
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,599
No, you must learn now
we don't have much time

1232
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:08,732
I won't be with you for very long

1233
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:21,771
Wo

1234
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:25,613
Don't hold a grudge against Grandma

1235
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:30,888
She is stubborn, but she is getting old

1236
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,052
You've to take care of her

1237
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:43,401
Don't worry, I will take care of her

1238
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:00,814
Man Fai

1239
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,358
Brother

1240
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,825
Man Fai, come back
if things don't work out

1241
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,662
I can make it Don't worry

1242
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,668
Dad, mom, I will be back

1243
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:21,205
If there're better
opportunities there, then stay

1244
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:23,069
No, I'll be back

1245
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,508
Man Fai

1246
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:30,942
There's so much
I couldn't do for you...

1247
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,147
You must be strong, stronger than me

1248
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:34,511
Don't cry

1249
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:38,322
Careful in everything you do

1250
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,230
Man Fai Grandma

1251
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,993
Take this red pocket as my blessing

1252
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:51,433
Thank you

1253
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,236
Time to board the plane

1254
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,705
Can I lead her to the plane

1255
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,038
Hurry up

1256
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:04,715
Goodbye, Man Fai

1257
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:37,745
Please stay here

1258
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,113
