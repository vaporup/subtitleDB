1
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,797
There's more over here!

2
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:37,203
Bring another team!

3
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,559
We'll need a lot more help!

4
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,210
Are you okay? Is the baby all right?

5
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,149
It's okay. You can stay with your dad.

6
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:48,848
I'm not his father. He's alone.

7
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,966
- Go with him.
- No, please.

8
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:51,729
- You'll be okay.
- I want to be with you.

9
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,748
Take him.

10
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:55,058
I've got to find the mother.

11
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,462
Now, go.

12
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,326
Come with me.

13
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,820
You'll be all right.

14
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,726
Everyone, please stay where you are.

15
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,621
We'll be with you in a minute.

16
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,660
Get them out of there! It's going to blow!
Get them out!

17
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:34,446
My boy!

18
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,411
My boy! My little boy's in there!

19
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:50,030
No, my baby's in there!

20
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,143
I can't leave my boy!

21
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,299
Stop!

22
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:55,286
Stop, my baby's in there!

23
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,461
My baby!

24
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,020
Stop!

25
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:57,867
Are you okay?

26
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:01,938
Were you in the crash?

27
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,954
No. I found this baby.

28
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:10,605
I've got to find the mother.

29
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:14,093
There's a woman over there.
She's looking for her baby.

30
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:19,441
Right over there.

31
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:26,835
Is this your baby?

32
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,492
My sweet angel.

33
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,453
I want to go to the nearest hotel.

34
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,013
You've got to be kidding.

35
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:32,460
You're not dead.

36
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,831
An InterCity Air spokesperson indicates
an estimated 200 passengers were...

37
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:50,704
Wire reports confirm a crash
of an InterCity Airjet...

38
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:53,808
...in the northeast section of the county
at Route 7 and Lake.

39
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:12,846
Although, remarkably enough,
people maintained themselves pretty well.

40
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:17,453
People pull together in a situation like that
and the crew was very professional.

41
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,533
Max.

42
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:29,328
Max Klein.

43
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,308
What the hell are you doing here?

44
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,423
Just passing through.

45
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:36,112
You bastard, you don't look any different.

46
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:37,589
- Nice try.
- It's true.

47
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:39,661
Look at you. I can't believe it!

48
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,772
It's been 20 years.

49
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:47,601
These are strawberry pancakes?

50
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:51,659
I wanted...

51
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,967
Do you have whole strawberries?

52
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,470
I guess.

53
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,227
Bring me a bowl, please.

54
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,870
I don't remember you having
a thing for strawberries.

55
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,787
How's Bill? Is he head
of the theater department yet?

56
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:05,614
No.

57
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,024
He was passed over.

58
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:11,921
I'll make this quick. I can't stand going
through the list. My life's a disaster.

59
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,233
No, it isn't.

60
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,285
- Yes, it is.
- Trust me.

61
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,837
Your life isn't a disaster.

62
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:36,299
I'm fat. I haven't written a play in years.
Timmy, my oldest...

63
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,683
...has a learning disability.

64
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:41,744
Thanks to therapy I love him for what
he is, not my fantasy of what he should be.

65
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:45,808
The middle two, James and Sarah,
resent the extra attention Timmy got...

66
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,016
...so they fuck up in school to punish us.

67
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:51,763
They're working it out in a support group,
Siblings of the Learning Disabled.

68
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:55,796
My youngest, Ellen, who was going to be
a great ballerina...

69
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,275
...destroyed her ankle playing basketball
with her brothers.

70
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,352
As for Bill, he's screwing a student.

71
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:06,931
Pathetic.

72
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,787
It's not even tragic.

73
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,056
Have a strawberry?

74
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:12,948
What good will that do?

75
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:15,472
Forbidden fruit always does good.

76
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,659
Forbidden fruit.

77
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,744
I didn't come for that.

78
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,039
It figures.

79
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,247
You always were faithful.

80
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,008
And you?

81
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:43,696
Who'd have me?

82
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,779
Wait a minute.

83
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:48,271
Aren't you allergic to strawberries?

84
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,157
Didn't you almost die when you were little
from eating a strawberry?

85
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:52,630
I'm past all that.

86
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:55,245
See? No reaction.

87
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,437
No reaction at all.

88
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:24,750
- That's him.
- What?

89
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:28,914
Good morning. I'm Agent Parsons,
this is Agent Smith. We're with the FBI.

90
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,816
You're registered as Mr. Max Klein...

91
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:35,797
...1147 Varennes in San Francisco.
Is that correct?

92
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,128
You got me.

93
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,602
Can we come in?

94
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,806
Were you on a flight from San Francisco
to Houston that made an emergency...

95
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,991
Yes, I was.

96
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,202
Took a hike from the scene?
Just up and left?

97
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,111
- What time is it?
- 10:00, Thursday morning.

98
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:58,067
You've been missing almost a day.

99
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,083
Missing?

100
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:00,946
What are you doing here?

101
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,694
You walked from the crash,
rented a car, drove to L.A...

102
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,062
Why?

103
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:08,853
They didn't need me anymore.

104
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:11,021
Need you for what?

105
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,220
Am I under arrest?

106
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:17,713
You haven't done anything.

107
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,653
Do you?

108
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,110
Do you know this man?

109
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:38,959
I'm Cindy Dickens...

110
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,326
...of InterCity Air and I'm here
to help get you home.

111
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,638
That's nice.

112
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:46,191
No one's taken me home
since the first grade.

113
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:51,022
I have tickets on AmTrak
to get you to San Francisco.

114
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:53,264
Your train leaves in an hour.

115
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,643
I want to fly.

116
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:55,986
I'm sorry?

117
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,048
You'll fly me back to San Francisco
for free...

118
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:01,484
...right?

119
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:03,661
Of course.

120
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,330
But when I told your wife the good news,
she said that...

121
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:13,036
...even before the unpleasant...

122
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:16,685
Crash.

123
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,319
Yes, right.

124
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,589
Even before that...

125
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,510
...you were afraid to fly.

126
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,220
I'd love to fly home on your airline,
but I've got a request.

127
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,359
Sir?

128
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:31,756
I want to go first class.

129
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:35,504
Super.

130
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,649
With our compliments, sir.

131
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:46,316
- Cockpit preparation?
- Completed.

132
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,339
Light test?

133
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,357
- Oxygen and interphone?
- Checked.

134
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:50,673
- Yaw damper?
- On.

135
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,755
Hydraulics?

136
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,779
On.

137
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,717
Sir, may I see your boarding pass?

138
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,533
Your seat is right down the aisle.

139
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,117
Is he on board?

140
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:16,915
I just made it.

141
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,252
I'm Bill Perlman.

142
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,379
Going home, right?

143
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,388
Glad to be going home, I bet.

144
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:30,993
You're a shrink.

145
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,104
That's right.

146
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:37,681
I specialize in the treatment
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

147
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,542
I wrote a book about it
and several airlines hired me...

148
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:44,305
We're pulling away from the gate.

149
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,992
...as a consultant to work
with crash survivors.

150
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:51,920
One of my perks is free tickets.
Seatbelt, I think you should put it on.

151
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:55,026
But I have to travel so much for work...

152
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,301
...that my idea of a vacation...

153
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:00,437
That's normal.

154
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,325
...is just to stay put.

155
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,989
I'm not scared.

156
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:06,963
But I would like another drink...

157
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,437
...when we're airborne.

158
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:10,929
I should say, if we're airborne.

159
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:34,963
- Mom, he's here! He's really here!
- I knew you were all right.

160
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,688
- I knew you were okay!
- We were so worried.

161
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,774
It's a miracle.

162
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,969
You're alive.

163
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:50,677
I knew I couldn't lose you.

164
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,630
- Coffee. Let's get coffee.
- Okay.

165
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,799
- Look at you. He's perfect.
- Yes, he is. He's just fine.

166
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:01,585
Come here.

167
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,519
Were you scared?

168
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:07,378
No.

169
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,621
Not at all.

170
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,643
Excuse me.

171
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:12,653
- I'm Steven Brillstein.
- Nan asked if he could wait here.

172
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,000
He's a lawyer.

173
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,794
I'm sorry to intrude, but...

174
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,150
...Mrs. Gordon's frustrated. The airline
can't make a definite identification.

175
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:21,076
Jeff's dead.

176
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:22,124
Oh, my God!

177
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:23,147
Jesus, Max!

178
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,836
Max isn't himself right now.

179
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,877
How do you know? We just met.

180
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:32,278
- I'm Bill Perlman.
- He's a therapist, works for the airline.

181
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,703
I'm here for you, Max.

182
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:38,189
If the airline pays your bills,
then it's a conflict of interest.

183
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:41,814
I have to warn Mr. Klein
that anything he says in your presence...

184
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,439
Is in confidence. It's my agreement.

185
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:45,104
Let's talk about that later.

186
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:49,330
Nan doesn't know.
She thinks if you're alive...

187
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,576
I'll tell her.

188
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:53,589
Can we speak privately?

189
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,248
This is inappropriate.

190
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,333
All right, out. Get out!

191
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:58,798
We should talk.

192
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,750
Max, relax.

193
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:03,472
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

194
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,971
I didn't hit him very hard.

195
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:09,521
I can't help you right now.

196
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,909
If you need anything, call me.

197
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:20,337
In fairness to Mrs. Gordon,
I should hear the details.

198
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:32,662
May I speak bluntly?

199
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:33,936
I'd prefer it.

200
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:36,308
You said you saw Mr. Gordon's dead body.

201
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:44,758
Let me give you a piece of advice.
When you speak to your lawyer...

202
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,820
...emphasize that you saw
your partner's dead body...

203
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,963
...and think hard about what else you saw.

204
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,813
It doesn't matter what you've said
to anybody so far.

205
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,246
With accidents there's a delayed reaction.

206
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,347
Memories of what happened
return gradually.

207
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:02,862
I know, I'm terrible to talk about it but...

208
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:06,132
...it's important that you remember...

209
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:09,843
...if you saw Mr. Gordon actually be killed.

210
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:12,884
Another thing to remember:

211
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,798
If he wasn't killed instantly...

212
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:17,585
...if he was in any pain...

213
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,368
You telling me how to lie
so I can get more money?

214
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,391
To be honest with you,
I wasn't thinking about you.

215
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,251
I was thinking about Mrs. Gordon.

216
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,358
She's not from a rich family and...

217
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:31,535
...now she's a widow with two children.

218
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,361
What? What?

219
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,720
What? What's wrong?

220
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,798
I don't want to tell any lies.

221
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:40,397
All right.

222
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,350
Next time, just say no.

223
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,289
Good evening, Mr. Klein.

224
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:52,950
Don't scream, okay?

225
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:56,875
Just bear in mind, you're sitting pretty,
you get the partnership insurance.

226
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,765
I think you owe Mrs. Gordon anything...

227
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,677
...that could improve her settlement
with the airlines.

228
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,813
One other thing:

229
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,034
I had all night to go through
Mr. Gordon's papers.

230
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,713
He cashed in the tickets
that you ordered on AMEX.

231
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:24,084
Got a better price,
rebought them for cash...

232
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,005
...and pocketed the difference.

233
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,682
So Jeff cheated me out of $200.

234
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,669
So he cheated his wife...

235
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:34,926
...out of the automatic
American Express insurance.

236
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,555
That's another reason why...

237
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:42,291
...your memory of what happened
on the plane is so important.

238
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:05,742
Steady.

239
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,206
I knew it. I just knew it...

240
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,455
...right away.

241
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,307
- We were stupid.
- No, you weren't.

242
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,782
We lived like jerks.

243
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:17,076
Always nagging. We wasted it.

244
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:19,348
He loved you.

245
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:23,852
Mom, keep the kids...

246
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:29,267
- Let's go back to your room.
- Why's she crying?

247
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:30,860
You made him happy.

248
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,176
He loved you.

249
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,995
He loved you.

250
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:37,205
Max, please shut up.

251
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:04,405
Let me hold you.

252
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:10,029
Why didn't you call?

253
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:11,245
Where were you?

254
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,911
I was visiting my past.

255
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:15,697
But why didn't you tell me you were alive?

256
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,316
I thought I was dead.

257
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:36,687
How does it feel to be a hero?

258
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,272
How did it feel those last few seconds?

259
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,296
It's me.

260
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,832
We live in the same city.

261
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,048
Isn't that great?

262
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,595
This is my son, Jonah.

263
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:57,867
Hi, I'm Byron.

264
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,698
Did you know the plane would crash?

265
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,141
I want to get on the bus.

266
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,380
I'm Peter, Byron's father.

267
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:21,302
I want to thank you.

268
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,076
You have a brave son.

269
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,133
I made my dad bring me.

270
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:27,921
I can't sleep.

271
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:29,645
I want to be with you.

272
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,126
Why do you want to be with him?

273
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,619
I feel safe with him.

274
00:23:33,014 --> 00:23:35,982
Many people are safe due to you.
They call you the Good Samaritan.

275
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:37,942
I didn't save anyone. The pilot did.

276
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:39,151
You saved me.

277
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,482
I was upside down, stuck. He got me out.

278
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,533
How?

279
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:44,851
And a baby too.

280
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:47,278
He found a way out for a lot of people.

281
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:49,203
We would've been fried.

282
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,861
What about the baby?

283
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:29,617
Get out of the road!

284
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,027
You can't do it!

285
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,231
You want to kill me, but you can't!

286
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:05,197
These images of death and destruction
flashed around the nation recently...

287
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:08,207
...when InterCity 202 fell from the sky.

288
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,742
The story is by now familiar.

289
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:15,053
A hydraulic failure on a routine flight
from San Francisco to Houston.

290
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,701
A desperate attempt to reach
Bakersfield Airport...

291
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:22,927
...before the metal giant plowed
into the corn beside a quiet country road.

292
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:25,420
Walking through this devastation...

293
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:28,342
...one could not help but reflect
on what it means to us...

294
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:30,774
...to those who lived,
to those who helped...

295
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,850
...and to those who mourned.

296
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:00,402
You and that computer.

297
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,470
You spend more time playing with it
than producing anything.

298
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:06,196
- Relax. Will you just relax?
- I'm fine.

299
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:10,005
You hear that?

300
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:14,190
This is a very important meeting.
I need you to calm down.

301
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:16,401
I need you to be with me. All right?

302
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,326
God, you're such a neurotic.

303
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,272
Something's not right.

304
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,565
Oh, shit!

305
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:54,575
This is the captain.
Return to your seats.

306
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:56,883
Put your tables up
and fasten your seatbelts.

307
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:59,213
Ladies and gentlemen, please be sure...

308
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:02,163
...to fasten your seatbelts
tightly around your waist.

309
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:05,390
The flight attendants will be coming
to collect your trays.

310
00:28:15,831 --> 00:28:17,653
I don't think this is turbulence.

311
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:21,359
The hydraulics!

312
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,249
He can't steer!

313
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,756
We're going down!

314
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:06,923
Miss!

315
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:08,531
Come here!

316
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,493
I'm okay.

317
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:12,243
Miss!

318
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:13,423
Miss, come here!

319
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:14,389
Come here!

320
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:17,172
The fucking belt won't work.
It won't get tight enough!

321
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,019
Just hold him in your lap.
That's what you're supposed to do anyway.

322
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,641
Just keep your belt on and hold him.

323
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:27,659
He'll be okay.

324
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,750
He's slipping! He's slipping!

325
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,501
He'll be okay.

326
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:40,207
I love you.

327
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,244
I need high-heeled shoes.

328
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:51,696
Remove all sharp objects.

329
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,474
Earrings. Sharp objects.

330
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:00,723
Sir, your pin. You must remove your pin.

331
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,384
You okay?

332
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,115
It's going to be fine.

333
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:12,108
Ma'am, you need to remove your glasses.
Take your glasses off your face.

334
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,544
You must take your glasses off your face...

335
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:16,141
...and put them in the bag.

336
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,482
It's unsafe to keep your glasses on.

337
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,602
All sharp objects to the center.

338
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,291
This is it.

339
00:30:42,998 --> 00:30:45,235
This is the moment of your death.

340
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,429
I'm not afraid.

341
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,421
I have no fear.

342
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:35,343
You know what time it is?

343
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:38,102
It's a fucking tomb in here.

344
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:46,380
Get up.

345
00:31:47,191 --> 00:31:48,271
Get up, Carla.

346
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:50,966
Get up.

347
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,298
The doctor brought someone.

348
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,439
The Good Samaritan.

349
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,483
Come on, you read about him in the paper.

350
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,647
Please, just let me die.

351
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:03,500
Please.

352
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:07,757
That's a sin, Carla.

353
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:10,037
I just want to die.

354
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:31,088
I appreciate you coming.

355
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,509
She's in bad shape.
I may put her in the hospital.

356
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:39,824
She's in a severe depression
about the crash, but she won't talk.

357
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:42,324
She's very Catholic.

358
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:43,757
Old World.

359
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,000
Full of guilt and shame.

360
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:49,685
I'm filled with guilt and shame.

361
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,634
How is that Old World?

362
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:55,310
You think I'm a fraud, don't you?

363
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:58,481
In the three months
since we flew together...

364
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,460
...I haven't thought about you at all.

365
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,547
She'll be right out.

366
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,595
Did you do this?

367
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,603
The carving?

368
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:13,426
Yeah, the whole bit.
I was playing, you know.

369
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:15,185
Beautiful work.

370
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:20,403
- You're an architect, right?
- Yes.

371
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,036
I better go get her.

372
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,118
It's better if I see her alone.

373
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,416
You know...

374
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:36,437
...one crash freak to another.

375
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:43,472
Second door on the right.

376
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:21,171
- Have a seat, Doc.
- Thanks.

377
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,124
He and your wife are the only survivors
I can't reach.

378
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:30,288
She won't talk and he won't admit
the crash was bad.

379
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,016
Is that right?

380
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,740
He says it was good?

381
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:37,356
Says it was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

382
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:53,678
When I was 13...

383
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,855
...my father died in front of my eyes.

384
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:58,863
We were going out of our apartment.

385
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:01,937
I was throwing this...

386
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:05,615
...this softball up and down.

387
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:10,898
Mom screamed, I missed the ball,
turned to look...

388
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:14,579
...Dad was dead on the sidewalk.

389
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:20,270
Blood was coming out of his nose.

390
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,860
His legs were all twisted under him.

391
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,192
He looked like somebody...

392
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:31,414
...with a big hand had reached down
and squeezed the life out of him.

393
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:35,504
That was God.

394
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:37,549
That's what I thought.

395
00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:39,732
God killed my daddy.

396
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:46,512
Why would He want to kill him?

397
00:35:49,174 --> 00:35:50,865
Couldn't figure that out.

398
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:56,179
He was a religious guy...

399
00:35:57,495 --> 00:35:58,542
...hard working...

400
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,404
...kind to my mother and my sister.

401
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:03,571
Did you love him?

402
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:07,500
Yes.

403
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:13,460
I didn't know why God killed my daddy.
There was no reason to.

404
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,069
So...

405
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:19,854
...I decided...

406
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:22,418
...there was no God.

407
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,670
You know...

408
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,904
...I go to church every day.

409
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,419
It's the only place I go.

410
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:52,077
I go to pray for my baby's soul.

411
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,704
You go there to talk to God.

412
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:58,064
Got to talk to somebody.

413
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:03,669
The day we got home...

414
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,988
...all these lawyers called,
wanting our case.

415
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:11,756
And one guy came to see me, saying
he was a Good Samaritan's lawyer...

416
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,188
...so I signed.

417
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:17,557
I mean, I figured he'd be the best. Right?

418
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:23,668
'Cause I need someone
who's going to take it to them.

419
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,045
We're going to church.

420
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:36,662
I think that'll be okay.

421
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:52,363
You know He hurt me.

422
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:59,317
He hurt me forever.

423
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,409
But I still believe in Him.

424
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,635
People...

425
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:15,794
...don't so much believe in God
as they choose not to believe in nothing.

426
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:21,326
Life and death...

427
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:24,660
...they happen for no reason.
We may think that...

428
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:27,408
...people are born
because their mothers wanted them...

429
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,859
...or because God needed
another home-run hitter for the Giants.

430
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:33,132
We think that we die...

431
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:35,792
...because we eat red meat or rob banks.

432
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,750
Though we can never be good enough...

433
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:43,921
...or careful enough to live forever,
at least we can try.

434
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:46,191
But if it makes no sense, if it...

435
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:49,585
If life and death just happen...

436
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,859
...then there's no reason to do anything.

437
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,692
There's no reason to love.

438
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:57,165
What?

439
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:02,032
There's no reason to love.

440
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,837
My car's across the street.
Let's go for a drive.

441
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:18,672
No. No, I can't.
The doctor told me I can't go nowhere.

442
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:20,112
You'll be safe.

443
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:21,903
Do you read the papers?

444
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:23,761
Everybody with me lives.

445
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:28,366
You must think I'm very stupid.

446
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:30,028
No. I'm not lying.

447
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:32,911
I can't explain it but...

448
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,536
...you're safe with me.

449
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:40,173
So, what are you telling me?
There's no God, but there's you?

450
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:44,912
Come with me.

451
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,275
Carla, I promise you'll be safe.

452
00:41:00,118 --> 00:41:01,547
This is a German car?

453
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:02,797
Swedish.

454
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:04,304
It's very sturdy?

455
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:05,868
It's a very safe car.

456
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:10,157
And I'm an excellent driver.
Never been in an accident.

457
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:13,714
Not while I've been behind the wheel,
anyway.

458
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,169
- And you know what?
- What?

459
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,860
It doesn't mean we'll survive this ride.

460
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,126
Because even if I do everything right...

461
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,741
...even strapped into this marvelous
technology of reinforced doors and roof...

462
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,366
...we could still be crushed.

463
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:29,933
That's reverse psychology, right?

464
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:32,396
No, it's the simple truth.

465
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:36,300
In fact you're not safe lying in your bed.

466
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,068
Remember '89? The next one could be
ten times worse.

467
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,314
You said I'd be safe with you.

468
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:48,463
You're safe.

469
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,214
We're safe because we died already.

470
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:56,912
Stop the car.

471
00:41:57,943 --> 00:41:59,503
Please, just stop the car.

472
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:03,025
I'm not dead.

473
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:05,486
Let me out.

474
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:07,795
No, you're not. That's not what I meant.

475
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:09,717
Look.

476
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,664
Look at them.

477
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,318
They don't know what's it's like
to die in their heads.

478
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,548
We do. We passed through death.

479
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:23,635
That's bullshit.

480
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:26,320
I didn't die in my head.

481
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:27,854
My son died.

482
00:42:30,102 --> 00:42:32,142
I wasn't thinking about dying.

483
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,288
I was thinking about...

484
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,598
About what?

485
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:37,427
About how he died?

486
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,769
Now hit him. Hit him, now!

487
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:50,190
Hit him. Right now!

488
00:43:50,263 --> 00:43:52,051
Two in a row. Awesome.

489
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:54,347
I'll die!

490
00:43:54,486 --> 00:43:56,559
Don't die, we'll get "game over."

491
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:58,358
- I died.
- Let me try.

492
00:44:00,502 --> 00:44:01,779
I got to Level 3.

493
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,055
Then he died.

494
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,162
- Where's your mother?
- I don't know.

495
00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:08,881
Byron's dad called.
He wants to bring him over later.

496
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,475
Do I have to play with him?

497
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:15,281
That's the weird kid your dad saved?

498
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,612
He comes here practically every day
and hangs around my dad.

499
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:20,973
Go.

500
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:27,663
Hi, darling.

501
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,449
I didn't know you were home.

502
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:34,482
- Did you meet with Dr. Perlman?
- Yeah.

503
00:44:35,703 --> 00:44:37,230
- Did you talk?
- No.

504
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,384
He took me to meet a woman
whose child died in the crash.

505
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:46,640
I thought the idea was for the two of you
to sit down and talk, one-to-one.

506
00:44:48,471 --> 00:44:50,860
I have a feeling
of overwhelming love for her.

507
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:56,085
I've never felt anything like it before.

508
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:03,954
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

509
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:06,005
...a little run, a little run!

510
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,136
Slide here.

511
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:16,086
Slide, slide, slide.

512
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,623
Change your hands.

513
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:26,349
Go, skip.

514
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:29,589
Change your hands.

515
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:41,461
Okay, Joan, stop the music.

516
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:43,984
Let's rehearse the piece for the pageant.

517
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,516
But we don't have Eric.

518
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,630
- No, we don't.
- That's right, we don't.

519
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:51,665
We need a volunteer.

520
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:55,020
Dr. Perlman, perhaps?

521
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:57,006
Me?

522
00:45:57,462 --> 00:45:58,323
I don't...

523
00:45:58,391 --> 00:45:59,700
I don't think... No.

524
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:04,013
Couldn't you get someone else?

525
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,653
We need a male. Do you mind?

526
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:11,312
- What do I have to do?
- A tree.

527
00:46:11,414 --> 00:46:12,494
Just a tree.

528
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:14,476
Just have to stand here. Like this.

529
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:18,162
Come on, Doctor. It'll be good therapy.

530
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:23,311
Okay, girls. Hold hands all around him.

531
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:27,052
Joan, some wind music.

532
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,126
Swirling around like a tornado.

533
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:31,855
And go in!

534
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:37,644
Doctor, the tree has leaves and branches.

535
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,660
Come on, up. Up with your arms.

536
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:43,921
Come on, up with your arms.
And feel the wind. Swing at the wind!

537
00:46:44,183 --> 00:46:45,644
Come on, Doctor.

538
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,166
Well...

539
00:46:49,462 --> 00:46:51,251
...is that your revenge?

540
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,547
Look, it's getting worse.

541
00:46:58,935 --> 00:47:00,909
He's more remote and distant than ever.

542
00:47:01,015 --> 00:47:04,757
He's spending more time with the child
from the plane than with his own son.

543
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,404
And I hate that crazy truth-telling,
like a robot.

544
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,985
What does he do every day?

545
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:14,160
He looks at buildings.

546
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:15,407
Looks at buildings?

547
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:17,267
I don't mind that. I think...

548
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:20,047
...he might be finding
something new for his work.

549
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,884
I want to know about this woman.

550
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:29,075
Why did you introduce them?
What were you trying to achieve?

551
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:33,426
No one can reach her. If she doesn't
get help, she'll end up in an institution.

552
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:34,603
Or worse.

553
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:35,918
And my husband?

554
00:47:37,431 --> 00:47:38,675
He worries me.

555
00:47:38,743 --> 00:47:39,691
Why?

556
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:41,966
I don't know.

557
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,396
I think he thinks he's invulnerable.

558
00:47:45,686 --> 00:47:47,661
I've seen it with Vietnam vets.

559
00:47:48,278 --> 00:47:50,929
The high they get
from overcoming their fear...

560
00:47:52,887 --> 00:47:55,985
...they become addicted to it.
I thought if I put them together...

561
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:57,713
They can help each other?

562
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,375
I don't know.

563
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:04,114
He said he felt overwhelming feeling
of love for her.

564
00:48:05,398 --> 00:48:07,286
A feeling he never felt before.

565
00:48:08,215 --> 00:48:10,735
What does that mean?
Is he falling in love with her?

566
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,615
Not in a rational way.

567
00:48:13,942 --> 00:48:15,317
Love isn't rational.

568
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:17,199
It's not love.

569
00:48:18,007 --> 00:48:19,348
He wants to save her.

570
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:20,684
Save her?

571
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:23,310
And who's saving Max?
Or me, for that matter?

572
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,897
Are you playing God?
Are you playing matchmaker?

573
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:29,523
What are you trying to achieve,
Dr. Perlman?

574
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:32,210
Trying to help, that's all.

575
00:48:33,942 --> 00:48:35,698
I don't have all the answers.

576
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:50,060
Can't wait to see what you're working on.

577
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:06,636
I'm going to bed now.

578
00:49:19,095 --> 00:49:20,720
Would you turn that down?

579
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:46,197
- I haven't taken one in six days.
- Didn't I tell you?

580
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:47,757
I feel great. Thanks.

581
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:50,416
He chickened out
half a mile from the airport.

582
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:52,948
Good to see you.

583
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,420
It's great that you came.

584
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:01,996
Everybody, we're going to go downstairs.
You come with me, Carla.

585
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,445
Everybody downstairs.

586
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:04,459
Come on.

587
00:50:05,558 --> 00:50:06,736
You wait here, Manny.

588
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:08,947
It's okay. It's all right.

589
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:11,763
I'll be upstairs.

590
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,672
We used to live in tribes.

591
00:50:19,575 --> 00:50:22,477
And when a tribe suffered a disaster...

592
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:26,188
...an exploding mountain,
a shaking of the earth...

593
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:28,885
...a great flood...

594
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:31,596
...we would sit around fires...

595
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:33,747
...and we'd tell the event.

596
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:36,246
The stories of death...

597
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,545
...destruction...

598
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,626
...escape and rescue.

599
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:45,457
That's... why we're here today.

600
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:50,353
Would someone...

601
00:50:51,478 --> 00:50:53,071
...tell us their story?

602
00:50:57,686 --> 00:50:58,766
Yes, please.

603
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:04,432
I lost my sister...

604
00:51:05,655 --> 00:51:07,182
...and my two nephews.

605
00:51:08,918 --> 00:51:10,828
Their seats were ripped away...

606
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:15,730
...right in front of my eyes.
I could almost reach out...

607
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:17,747
It's all right.

608
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:19,505
Let her stay on her own.

609
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,132
This'll take forever.

610
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:23,949
I have to go back to the office.

611
00:51:24,055 --> 00:51:25,003
What's your name?

612
00:51:25,078 --> 00:51:26,453
John Wilkenson.

613
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,325
- Why were you on the plane?
- I was going to Houston on business.

614
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,813
You must be very committed to your work.

615
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:38,580
Go ahead and finish your story, please.

616
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,829
We were taking a vacation, my sister...

617
00:51:43,959 --> 00:51:45,366
...me and our kids.

618
00:51:45,815 --> 00:51:47,538
You know, no husbands.

619
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:52,591
We saw all the dumb tourist sights
together, like when we were girls.

620
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:55,346
Only this time, we were also mommies.

621
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:02,100
And now we'll never be together again.

622
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:06,188
Let's just talk about the day of the crash.

623
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:08,915
What happened when the plane hit?

624
00:52:11,479 --> 00:52:12,624
I don't know.

625
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:17,521
I guess I closed my eyes.

626
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,019
There was incredible noise...

627
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:22,134
...and I couldn't see.

628
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:23,954
I was choking on the smoke.

629
00:52:24,694 --> 00:52:26,767
I didn't think that we had long to live.

630
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:29,366
And then that man...

631
00:52:29,687 --> 00:52:30,734
Is he here?

632
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:33,519
Are you here, Max Klein?

633
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,867
He couldn't come.

634
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:41,619
He saved my life.

635
00:52:42,263 --> 00:52:43,211
How?

636
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,646
We couldn't see anything
and it was all smoke.

637
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:53,067
We couldn't even breathe
and I heard the sound of his voice.

638
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:56,339
He was shouting:

639
00:52:56,534 --> 00:52:58,061
"Follow me! This way!"

640
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:01,933
I had hold of my kids
and I just followed his voice.

641
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:06,573
He sounded so normal.

642
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:10,864
"Follow me to the light!"

643
00:53:13,718 --> 00:53:14,929
I was scared...

644
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:17,679
...but I saw him jump...

645
00:53:18,743 --> 00:53:20,019
...and call out:

646
00:53:22,454 --> 00:53:23,632
"We're alive!"

647
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,997
So I followed and...

648
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,872
...then we were in the corn field.

649
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:31,212
Safe.

650
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:34,285
I would have gone the wrong way.

651
00:53:35,575 --> 00:53:37,582
I came here today hoping to thank him.

652
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,728
The same thing happened to me.

653
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,267
I followed him too.

654
00:53:41,335 --> 00:53:42,993
Excuse me, are you leaving us?

655
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:44,660
I don't belong here.

656
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:46,035
I wasn't on the plane.

657
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:47,375
Who are you?

658
00:53:47,831 --> 00:53:50,351
My son died in the crash. I'm sorry.

659
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:53,614
No, it's okay. It's all right.
Why did you come?

660
00:53:56,054 --> 00:53:57,199
I don't know.

661
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,278
I wanted...

662
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:02,028
...if anyone had seen my son...

663
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,715
...or knew how...

664
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:08,046
- What was his name?
- Where was he sitting?

665
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,224
They said he was in 21C.

666
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:13,202
That was right behind me.

667
00:54:15,129 --> 00:54:16,623
Did he have red hair?

668
00:54:17,016 --> 00:54:19,023
Yes. Kind of reddish brown.

669
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:21,359
- Tall man?
- Six feet.

670
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:22,957
And a moustache?

671
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,212
Yes.

672
00:54:25,112 --> 00:54:26,323
You mean me.

673
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,917
Remember? We talked at the hospital.

674
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,502
We were on the other side of the plane.

675
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,927
Sorry.

676
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:37,392
Since it happened, I get confused.

677
00:54:40,408 --> 00:54:42,230
Anyone else remember that row?

678
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,975
21C was three rows ahead of me.

679
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,123
They were smashed flat.

680
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:48,598
Can anyone else help?

681
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:50,354
Go ahead, say something.

682
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:54,477
- Anyone else have information?
- Stop it.

683
00:54:56,024 --> 00:54:57,453
Just let her go.

684
00:54:58,073 --> 00:54:59,055
Why?

685
00:55:01,657 --> 00:55:03,380
This isn't doing anybody any good.

686
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:05,172
She only wants to know what happened.

687
00:55:05,241 --> 00:55:06,615
My son died.

688
00:55:06,713 --> 00:55:08,753
Yes, but you know how he died.

689
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,774
You were with him.

690
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:16,241
When was the last time you saw your son?

691
00:55:16,344 --> 00:55:18,483
His birthday, about a month before.

692
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:21,588
I don't remember kissing him good-bye.

693
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,141
I know I did, but I just can't remember.

694
00:55:26,328 --> 00:55:27,473
You're very young.

695
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:30,896
I'm not young.

696
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,487
How old was your boy?

697
00:55:35,609 --> 00:55:37,070
He was almost two.

698
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:38,896
I'm sorry.

699
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:40,561
He wasn't with you very long.

700
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:41,712
Jesus Christ!

701
00:55:41,784 --> 00:55:44,533
This is sadistic.
And we're not accomplishing anything!

702
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:54,995
Do you remember me?

703
00:55:55,576 --> 00:55:57,485
I'm Lisa. The flight attendant.

704
00:56:04,024 --> 00:56:05,747
I really wanted to see you.

705
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:09,911
I came here mostly to see you.

706
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:15,536
I think about you and your baby a lot.

707
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,645
Do you remember how I tried to help you
with the seat belt?

708
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:23,792
Help me?

709
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,431
You told me everything would be okay.
You think you helped me?

710
00:56:29,176 --> 00:56:30,801
Well, I tried.

711
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:32,017
Tried!

712
00:56:32,376 --> 00:56:34,929
You told me to hold him. I couldn't.

713
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:37,391
You told me everything would be okay.

714
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:38,096
It wasn't!

715
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:39,249
Please, don't say that.

716
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:40,269
I didn't...

717
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:42,190
I didn't know!

718
00:56:42,264 --> 00:56:43,638
You didn't know what?

719
00:56:44,056 --> 00:56:44,852
Please.

720
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,262
You told me to hold him.

721
00:56:46,328 --> 00:56:48,467
- You knew I couldn't!
- It's not my fault!

722
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:50,292
We're not here to blame each other.

723
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,335
You said everything would be okay...

724
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,586
...and it wasn't!

725
00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:54,768
He died!

726
00:57:00,472 --> 00:57:02,163
You want everybody to talk.

727
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:05,009
But only if it's nice things.

728
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,487
No, that's not true.

729
00:57:08,312 --> 00:57:09,392
My son died!

730
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,982
And blaming her won't bring
your baby back.

731
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:27,214
Of course they think it's fair.

732
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,623
So what? What do you think?

733
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:32,885
I'm being fucked.

734
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:36,277
The big law firms are getting
much more for their clients.

735
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:38,770
I'll get another lawyer.

736
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:42,900
Mr. Brillstein, I heard a woman got
$2 million for her dead baby.

737
00:57:42,968 --> 00:57:45,073
I think I should get at least that.

738
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:49,141
I'll call you. I'll call you every day.

739
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,022
Good-bye.

740
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,869
You have to understand...

741
00:57:58,136 --> 00:58:00,657
...they owe us. They kill them
and they have to pay.

742
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:03,029
You don't understand a fucking thing!

743
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,687
I understand, Manny.

744
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:08,052
I understand that I'm alone.

745
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,575
So, pain and suffering are compensable.

746
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:19,384
Apart from the other compensable losses
such as...

747
00:58:19,448 --> 00:58:22,383
...the $2-million Nutty Nick stores contract.

748
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,949
We didn't have a contract.

749
00:58:24,665 --> 00:58:26,552
- Whose side are you on?
- Relax.

750
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:29,682
Don't tell me to relax. You have a husband
and a partnership insurance.

751
00:58:29,752 --> 00:58:30,646
I have...

752
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,851
...a deposition from...

753
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,414
...Mr. Nutty Nick...

754
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,098
...that he had every intention...

755
00:58:38,584 --> 00:58:41,104
...of hiring Mr. Gordon and Mr. Klein.

756
00:58:41,176 --> 00:58:42,256
That's good enough.

757
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:43,637
He's lying.

758
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,175
It's nice, but he's lying.

759
00:58:45,241 --> 00:58:46,288
All right.

760
00:58:46,968 --> 00:58:48,146
Do me a favor.

761
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,971
Don't say that.

762
00:58:50,552 --> 00:58:52,941
They don't have to know your opinion,
okay?

763
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,431
Work with me on this, Mr. Klein.

764
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,904
I'm sorry.

765
00:58:58,008 --> 00:59:00,911
You promised to do your best
for Mrs. Gordon and her children.

766
00:59:01,016 --> 00:59:02,772
You get a third of what we get?

767
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,214
I know. I'm terrible.

768
00:59:05,304 --> 00:59:07,311
One-third is standard, Mr. Klein.

769
00:59:08,216 --> 00:59:11,283
It's in my interest to get
as large a settlement as possible.

770
00:59:11,353 --> 00:59:12,978
In fact, that's my job.

771
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,669
I don't apologize for it.

772
00:59:14,745 --> 00:59:18,040
No, this is America in the '90s.
Nobody apologizes anymore.

773
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:19,606
They write a memoir.

774
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:23,640
This is the law. Not some trick I invented.

775
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,888
Each minute that you and Mr. Gordon
knew that you were going to die...

776
00:59:27,992 --> 00:59:30,131
...is compensable as pain and suffering.

777
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:31,181
Testify...

778
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:33,015
...to the mental anguish...

779
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:35,120
...that you and Mr. Gordon experienced...

780
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:37,494
...and each minute is worth dollars.

781
00:59:37,912 --> 00:59:41,425
Big dollars. Dollars to which
you and Mrs. Gordon are entitled.

782
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:44,471
What you really want me to say...

783
00:59:44,696 --> 00:59:48,471
...is that Jeff wept at the prospect
of his wife widowed and kids orphaned.

784
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:52,244
It's a shame he died instantly.
If only he'd been mashed up and died...

785
00:59:52,312 --> 00:59:53,774
...slowly in my arms, Nan...

786
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:54,776
Jesus, Max!

787
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,084
...could make out on this.

788
00:59:56,152 --> 00:59:57,559
Fine. Good night.

789
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,527
Are you ashamed of me?

790
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:09,261
I'm trying to get money, so I don't meet
your standards of widowhood?

791
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:12,846
Let me ask you something.
If Jeff was here, what would he do?

792
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:15,473
Come on, Max, tell me.

793
01:00:16,472 --> 01:00:17,454
I can't lie.

794
01:00:17,528 --> 01:00:21,685
If you died and he had lived, what would
he say to help Laura and Jonah?

795
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:25,424
I know he ripped you off for the tickets.

796
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,390
Maybe!

797
01:00:26,552 --> 01:00:27,567
Maybe he'd pay him back.

798
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,135
Are you punishing Jeff?

799
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:35,729
I'll say what you want.

800
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:50,223
Let it go.

801
01:01:52,089 --> 01:01:53,365
I can let it go.

802
01:02:38,072 --> 01:02:39,730
I can't live as a coward.

803
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,807
Oh, fuck.

804
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,047
So I argued that it wasn't fair to us
and he agreed.

805
01:03:44,184 --> 01:03:46,289
He just said, "Life is unfair."

806
01:03:46,584 --> 01:03:50,261
So now the test's next week
and it's on Europe, not Central America.

807
01:03:50,488 --> 01:03:52,114
I think he proved his own point.

808
01:03:52,185 --> 01:03:54,159
Yeah, that's what I thought.

809
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:01,204
What'd you do today, Dad?

810
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:07,503
Go ahead.

811
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,182
Tell him.

812
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:13,972
What? What'd you do?

813
01:04:21,368 --> 01:04:22,448
Talk to me.

814
01:04:24,984 --> 01:04:26,511
Tell me what's going on.

815
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:29,616
Talk to me!

816
01:04:37,176 --> 01:04:40,788
Each day you have to jump off a roof
or stand before a train to lose your fear?

817
01:04:40,856 --> 01:04:41,903
Is that it?

818
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:44,337
What about me?

819
01:04:44,664 --> 01:04:46,071
What about Jonah?

820
01:04:46,328 --> 01:04:48,881
- You're like a crazy person.
- I'm not crazy.

821
01:04:51,193 --> 01:04:54,160
I love you. We have lived together
for 16 years!

822
01:04:54,968 --> 01:04:56,343
They've been great.

823
01:04:56,953 --> 01:04:58,163
Oh, not always.

824
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:00,055
Yes. Always.

825
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:03,314
They've always been great for me.

826
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:05,848
Even when I hate you, I know love you.

827
01:05:11,576 --> 01:05:13,234
I know you were happy too.

828
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:15,597
Remember?

829
01:05:30,936 --> 01:05:32,791
Do you remember our marriage?

830
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,564
Even if I could remember, then what?

831
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:45,172
How can I live in a memory?

832
01:05:46,521 --> 01:05:47,862
You see, that's cruel.

833
01:05:48,024 --> 01:05:50,326
- Do you know that's cruel?
- That's the truth.

834
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,503
The truth?

835
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,775
You didn't tell Jonah the truth.

836
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:57,295
It was unfair to use him that way.

837
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,487
Fair?

838
01:05:58,616 --> 01:06:01,267
Am I supposed to let you kill yourself?

839
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,956
I walked away from that crash alive.

840
01:06:04,024 --> 01:06:07,472
That's what survived.
The taste and touch and beauty of life.

841
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:08,406
But I love that.

842
01:06:08,472 --> 01:06:11,155
- I won't give that up!
- I don't want you to give it up!

843
01:06:12,024 --> 01:06:13,202
Let me in.

844
01:06:14,392 --> 01:06:15,886
Let me be part of it.

845
01:06:18,105 --> 01:06:19,119
You can't.

846
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,959
- I wish I'd been on that plane.
- I'm grateful you weren't.

847
01:06:24,056 --> 01:06:27,733
You don't make sense. You said
it was extraordinary, so beautiful.

848
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:30,799
You're right. I don't make sense
and I don't want to.

849
01:06:37,272 --> 01:06:39,247
I know that what you found is...

850
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:43,693
...special, whatever it is,
and wherever it leads you, it's thrilling.

851
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,312
But there must be a way...

852
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:50,615
...to live with it so it does make sense.

853
01:06:55,704 --> 01:06:57,362
I'm going to survive this.

854
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:03,406
I can't fight for you anymore. You want
to destroy yourself? I can't stop you.

855
01:07:05,912 --> 01:07:07,286
I hope you make it.

856
01:07:48,408 --> 01:07:49,968
You been dreaming a lot?

857
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,207
- You bet.
- Me too.

858
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,466
Were you alone on the plane?

859
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,055
No, I was with my best friend. My partner.

860
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,814
He was decapitated.

861
01:08:04,569 --> 01:08:05,681
You saw him?

862
01:08:14,328 --> 01:08:15,735
I should be going.

863
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,109
Thanks for coming.

864
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:24,212
You know, if...

865
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:27,598
If Manny has any interest
in doing carpentry full time...

866
01:08:27,672 --> 01:08:29,559
...I could talk to some people.

867
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,502
They'd be happy to work
with somebody like him.

868
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,124
Don't talk about my husband.

869
01:08:36,056 --> 01:08:37,004
Sorry.

870
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:41,107
No, it's all right.
I'm angry with him, that's all.

871
01:08:46,264 --> 01:08:47,758
Don't look so scared.

872
01:08:48,184 --> 01:08:49,428
I'm not scared.

873
01:08:49,976 --> 01:08:51,667
I'm not scared of anything.

874
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:53,783
Scared to kiss me.

875
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:55,407
I just did kiss you.

876
01:08:55,545 --> 01:08:56,854
I mean, for real.

877
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,756
I didn't want to offend you.

878
01:09:05,112 --> 01:09:06,192
You're right.

879
01:09:07,673 --> 01:09:09,363
I don't want to be kissed.

880
01:09:09,785 --> 01:09:11,279
I don't want anything.

881
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:22,132
But I do want to go with you
next time you take a drive.

882
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,516
I'm missing it.

883
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,502
Look at this show!

884
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:41,779
It's beautiful.

885
01:09:49,145 --> 01:09:50,803
Kate is so serious, isn't she?

886
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,069
Oh, look!

887
01:09:53,432 --> 01:09:54,610
Adorable!

888
01:09:56,281 --> 01:09:57,229
Bravo!

889
01:10:00,473 --> 01:10:01,487
Beautiful!

890
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,222
Wonderful! Wonderful!

891
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:08,786
Wonderful!

892
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:40,692
Folks, this is the captain here.

893
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,404
We're going to make an emergency landing
at Bakersfield Airport.

894
01:10:44,696 --> 01:10:47,631
Fasten your seatbelts before touchdown.
At that time...

895
01:10:47,705 --> 01:10:50,672
...you'll hear me say the words,
"Brace, brace, brace."

896
01:10:50,745 --> 01:10:54,040
Hi, this is Nan. I'll callyou back
as soon as possible.

897
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:57,844
Get into the crash positions
which your cabin attendants will illustrate.

898
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,546
I'm not going to kid you,
it's going to be rough...

899
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,845
...maybe worse than that.

900
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,949
Pay attention to what
the cabin attendants say.

901
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,007
Good luck to us all.

902
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:27,506
- May we be excused?
- Bring a bag of chips.

903
01:11:29,656 --> 01:11:31,030
Let's play computer games.

904
01:11:32,152 --> 01:11:33,265
Let them go.

905
01:11:33,368 --> 01:11:35,823
It's a mistake to make them
anything but hamburgers.

906
01:11:35,896 --> 01:11:38,035
Next time we'll have relish and ketchup.

907
01:11:39,353 --> 01:11:42,036
What can you do? I don't mind,
as long as they're happy.

908
01:11:42,104 --> 01:11:44,657
If we'll have Thanksgiving, let's do it right.

909
01:11:48,089 --> 01:11:49,845
Max, don't play superdad.

910
01:11:53,464 --> 01:11:54,511
Byron, honey, no.

911
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,003
Give me this. Give me this.

912
01:11:58,072 --> 01:12:00,341
- This is garbage.
- What're you doing?

913
01:12:00,408 --> 01:12:01,718
Go back to the table and finish!

914
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:04,021
- Max, calm down.
- I'm perfectly calm.

915
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,225
Listen to me. I'm throwing this out.

916
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,695
When you die, you don't get another life.

917
01:12:09,465 --> 01:12:12,279
- Do you understand?
- It's not real dying. It's pretend.

918
01:12:12,345 --> 01:12:14,516
- I know what dead bodies look like.
- Shut up!

919
01:12:14,617 --> 01:12:15,991
It's going in the garbage.

920
01:12:16,568 --> 01:12:19,470
- He's only a little boy.
- If it was up to you, he'd stay a boy.

921
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:20,591
I don't care!

922
01:12:20,664 --> 01:12:21,842
Don't be cruel.

923
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:25,360
I don't want him to grow up
a frightened child in a man's body.

924
01:12:25,433 --> 01:12:26,807
He's just fine, Max.

925
01:12:26,872 --> 01:12:28,498
It's you who is in trouble!

926
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:29,943
Now give the game back.

927
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,658
Or keep on going,
but right out of our lives!

928
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:37,199
Our son is innocent.
Do you want to crash our marriage?

929
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:40,014
Okay, but don't hurt our son.

930
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,382
I'm not scared to end our marriage.

931
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,585
Neither am I.

932
01:12:47,705 --> 01:12:49,330
Then I'll keep on going.

933
01:12:52,184 --> 01:12:53,264
Good.

934
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,963
- Where to?
- Beautiful downtown Oakland.

935
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:35,666
Such a shame.

936
01:14:37,209 --> 01:14:40,754
It was going to be gentrified and rebuilt.
Then the recession hit.

937
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:43,221
The country's falling apart.

938
01:14:45,016 --> 01:14:47,700
The United States is finished.
But you and me...

939
01:14:47,832 --> 01:14:49,458
...we're in peak condition.

940
01:15:07,992 --> 01:15:09,072
You hungry?

941
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:11,536
In there?

942
01:15:12,088 --> 01:15:13,998
Remember, we're ghosts.

943
01:15:14,936 --> 01:15:16,944
They can't do anything to us.

944
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:19,600
You're really nuts. You are so crazy.

945
01:15:19,672 --> 01:15:20,949
You should talk.

946
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:41,718
I can't believe you did that!
I'm not buying you another.

947
01:15:42,168 --> 01:15:43,729
Look at this mess.

948
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,935
I've had it. We're going home.

949
01:15:46,136 --> 01:15:47,151
So happy.

950
01:16:55,768 --> 01:16:57,197
Maybe I am a ghost.

951
01:17:12,888 --> 01:17:15,190
I was going to buy him a lot of presents.

952
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:22,232
Let's do it. Let's buy them.

953
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,822
What did he like?

954
01:17:25,464 --> 01:17:26,708
How about a sword?

955
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:29,875
My son used to love swords.
He still does, but he's too old to admit it.

956
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,083
- What?
- What would your son like?

957
01:17:33,752 --> 01:17:36,272
Does he play with Legos?
No, he's too young.

958
01:17:37,592 --> 01:17:39,763
Bristle Blocks? Does he have those?

959
01:17:39,832 --> 01:17:42,418
Babies can use them
and older kids like them.

960
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,528
You want me to buy a present for Bubble?

961
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:46,484
Bubble. Is that really his name?

962
01:17:46,584 --> 01:17:48,723
It's Leonardo. I called him Bubble.

963
01:17:49,145 --> 01:17:51,152
I can't buy him gifts. That's sick.

964
01:17:51,256 --> 01:17:53,460
- Why?
- Because he's dead.

965
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,179
- Of course he's dead.
- You're not serious.

966
01:17:56,633 --> 01:17:58,421
You wouldn't do this to me.

967
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:01,013
Would you buy a present
for your dead father?

968
01:18:03,064 --> 01:18:04,079
My father?

969
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:07,344
I never bought him anything.

970
01:18:08,857 --> 01:18:09,871
I'm sorry.

971
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,491
I didn't mean it. I just don't think
it's a good idea.

972
01:18:13,561 --> 01:18:15,349
I made him something in school.

973
01:18:15,896 --> 01:18:17,074
Carved his name in wood.

974
01:18:17,145 --> 01:18:20,494
Made a little nameplate
that you put on your desk.

975
01:18:22,104 --> 01:18:23,827
I was 13 when he died and...

976
01:18:25,177 --> 01:18:27,632
...never had a chance to buy him
a real present.

977
01:18:27,992 --> 01:18:29,072
Let's do it.

978
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:31,283
Let's buy presents for the dead.

979
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:33,939
Come on. Let's buy presents for the dead.

980
01:18:34,232 --> 01:18:35,988
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

981
01:18:36,056 --> 01:18:37,136
Come on!

982
01:18:38,105 --> 01:18:39,795
Who'll we give them to?

983
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:46,744
He liked to build things: Shelves, chairs.
He made our dining-room table.

984
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:49,903
Sometimes he'd give me a hammer,
let me do the easy stuff.

985
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:56,565
This is it. This is what he'd like.

986
01:18:57,209 --> 01:19:00,438
Every time we came into a hardware store,
he'd stop in front of these.

987
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,022
It wasn't as magnificent as this one.

988
01:19:05,176 --> 01:19:06,125
He'd be...

989
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:07,758
...totally silent...

990
01:19:10,424 --> 01:19:11,701
...and then he'd say...

991
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:15,475
..."I'd like to have that"...

992
01:19:16,216 --> 01:19:17,776
...and walk away.

993
01:19:19,993 --> 01:19:22,927
Only thing I ever heard him say he wanted.
Excuse me.

994
01:19:23,385 --> 01:19:24,562
Excuse me!

995
01:19:25,305 --> 01:19:26,712
I'd like to buy this for my father.

996
01:19:26,873 --> 01:19:29,044
That's nice. I'll take care of that.

997
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,731
I've got to get him a monster.
He loves them.

998
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,457
I'll find him something.

999
01:19:45,016 --> 01:19:45,910
Come here.

1000
01:19:46,008 --> 01:19:47,764
Look at this. This is great.

1001
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,030
Do you mind?

1002
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:57,007
Sorry.

1003
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,379
Look what I have for us.
A beautiful bevy of desserts.

1004
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:04,308
Now...

1005
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:05,781
...this.

1006
01:20:07,256 --> 01:20:09,842
- Don't want any.
- We could use it as a paperweight.

1007
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,375
I want that.

1008
01:20:11,608 --> 01:20:13,583
This is the only thing you can't have.

1009
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,649
Now I have several other magical...

1010
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,687
I have a magic mushroom for you.

1011
01:20:21,593 --> 01:20:22,770
Or better yet...

1012
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,331
...the beautiful simplicity...

1013
01:20:25,496 --> 01:20:27,405
...of a ripe strawberry.

1014
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:51,922
Let's dance.

1015
01:20:53,304 --> 01:20:54,286
Come on.

1016
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:55,570
I don't dance.

1017
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:56,783
Come on!

1018
01:20:57,465 --> 01:20:58,447
Pick up.

1019
01:21:04,696 --> 01:21:05,644
Hold on!

1020
01:21:07,704 --> 01:21:09,527
Oh, please, please, please.

1021
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,836
Good night.

1022
01:21:31,161 --> 01:21:32,437
So I'll pick you up?

1023
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:35,919
My goodness, it's night.

1024
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:48,110
Where are we going?

1025
01:21:51,704 --> 01:21:53,428
We could disappear.

1026
01:22:07,897 --> 01:22:09,304
You all right?

1027
01:22:11,608 --> 01:22:12,917
What's wrong?

1028
01:22:17,688 --> 01:22:18,703
What?

1029
01:22:21,528 --> 01:22:23,634
There's something I have to tell you.

1030
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:27,025
You got to promise
you'll never tell anyone.

1031
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,327
All right.

1032
01:22:44,152 --> 01:22:45,614
All right, calm down now.

1033
01:22:46,584 --> 01:22:47,959
What is it?

1034
01:22:48,921 --> 01:22:49,935
What?

1035
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,746
I want to tell you something
that nobody knows.

1036
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:56,238
Do you remember...

1037
01:22:56,728 --> 01:23:00,722
...just when we touched ground and
it was like we were going to land okay?

1038
01:23:06,457 --> 01:23:07,405
What?

1039
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:13,070
I let go of Bubble.

1040
01:23:15,576 --> 01:23:18,838
I had him in my lap.
I looked at the road and...

1041
01:23:19,064 --> 01:23:22,326
...I thought we were going to be safe,
and the wheels bumped.

1042
01:23:22,488 --> 01:23:24,114
I opened my arms.

1043
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:28,017
I was safe in my belt, but he wasn't.

1044
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:30,323
Oh, I see. It was your fault?

1045
01:23:30,553 --> 01:23:31,796
It wasn't the accident?

1046
01:23:31,865 --> 01:23:34,963
- I wasn't holding him!
- You killed your baby?

1047
01:23:35,961 --> 01:23:37,455
And the lawyer...

1048
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,310
- Brillstein?
...I didn't tell him the truth.

1049
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:43,509
I understand. So you're also a liar?

1050
01:23:44,601 --> 01:23:49,270
Yes, I lied! I lied to Father Conti.
I lied in the confessional.

1051
01:23:49,336 --> 01:23:51,703
I lied to the whole church!

1052
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,902
- It wasn't your fault.
- Oh, my God.

1053
01:23:53,976 --> 01:23:55,569
Oh, my God!

1054
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,462
Carla, it's not your fault.

1055
01:23:59,896 --> 01:24:01,358
"Hail, Mary, full of grace...

1056
01:24:01,433 --> 01:24:04,083
"...the Lord is with Thee.
Blessed art Thou amongst women...

1057
01:24:04,153 --> 01:24:06,192
"...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb Jesus."

1058
01:24:06,264 --> 01:24:09,079
Carla, I didn't mean
that you killed your baby.

1059
01:24:11,192 --> 01:24:13,014
Carla, you're not to blame.

1060
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:16,536
You couldn't have held on to your baby.

1061
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,934
We were going hundreds of miles an hour!

1062
01:24:23,672 --> 01:24:25,647
Of course you think it's your fault.

1063
01:24:25,944 --> 01:24:28,977
God gave you a child.
It was your job to keep him safe.

1064
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,087
But it's not your fault!

1065
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:34,834
Stop it now! Come on, stop it!
That's enough!

1066
01:24:41,784 --> 01:24:42,733
Oh, shit.

1067
01:24:50,616 --> 01:24:51,925
Oh, shit.

1068
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:57,492
Now what have I done?

1069
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,475
Come on now.
I want you to get in the back.

1070
01:25:25,305 --> 01:25:26,199
Come on.

1071
01:25:28,568 --> 01:25:29,648
Come on.

1072
01:25:29,753 --> 01:25:31,029
Come on now.

1073
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:32,526
Come on.

1074
01:25:38,393 --> 01:25:40,018
Just get in the back now.

1075
01:25:52,696 --> 01:25:54,190
This is your baby.

1076
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,204
No, hold it upright, like this.

1077
01:25:57,272 --> 01:25:59,956
I know it doesn't look like a baby.
It looks like a toolbox.

1078
01:26:00,024 --> 01:26:01,104
It is a toolbox.

1079
01:26:01,177 --> 01:26:03,664
I want you to pretend
that this is your baby.

1080
01:26:03,736 --> 01:26:05,165
Pretend it's Bubble.

1081
01:26:05,944 --> 01:26:08,595
Now this is your chance to hold on tight...

1082
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:10,134
...to save him.

1083
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:42,258
Hold on to Bubble!

1084
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:44,526
As tight as you can!

1085
01:26:54,616 --> 01:26:57,169
Pray to God to give you the strength
to save your baby.

1086
01:27:04,824 --> 01:27:06,450
Hold on to your baby!

1087
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,178
Holy Mary, Mother of God!

1088
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,127
Pray for us now
and at the hour of our death!

1089
01:27:55,192 --> 01:27:57,134
Right behind you. Careful, please.

1090
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,818
Mrs. Rodrigo, how are you doing?

1091
01:28:08,888 --> 01:28:09,750
I'm okay.

1092
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:11,605
It's whiplash. I was with Max.

1093
01:28:11,672 --> 01:28:14,989
I know. He's in intensive care.
He'll be all right.

1094
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:16,597
Just between us...

1095
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:17,809
...what happened?

1096
01:28:18,936 --> 01:28:20,146
He was showing me something.

1097
01:28:20,216 --> 01:28:22,605
What? That brick walls are hard?

1098
01:28:24,121 --> 01:28:26,095
How'd you get here so fast?

1099
01:28:26,808 --> 01:28:29,263
My beeper went off,
I was just two blocks away.

1100
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,855
I don't know. I've been really lucky lately.

1101
01:28:32,376 --> 01:28:34,198
I mean, I know it's terrible...

1102
01:28:34,265 --> 01:28:36,436
...to talk about luck
when you've suffered so.

1103
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:38,064
Have you seen a doctor yet?

1104
01:28:39,768 --> 01:28:40,696
Are you okay?

1105
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,905
Yes, I'm fine.

1106
01:28:42,328 --> 01:28:45,198
- What happened?
- Mr. Klein drove into a brick wall.

1107
01:28:47,064 --> 01:28:48,493
You don't understand.

1108
01:28:48,665 --> 01:28:50,999
The flight attendant told me
to hold Bubble.

1109
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:54,167
I thought I didn't hold him tight enough.

1110
01:28:54,233 --> 01:28:57,746
I wasn't sure my hands were clasped
when we hit.

1111
01:28:58,936 --> 01:29:01,075
Be careful about what we're not sure of.

1112
01:29:02,648 --> 01:29:04,470
I thought I could save him.

1113
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,607
Max showed me I couldn't.

1114
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,298
- There was no way.
- He crashed the car on purpose?

1115
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,480
Yes, to show me.

1116
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:11,414
That's it.

1117
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,749
That fucking nut ain't coming close to you!

1118
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,150
- Let me talk to you.
- It's out of control.

1119
01:29:16,313 --> 01:29:19,662
Listen, our case is good. Actually,
we could improve our numbers here.

1120
01:29:32,856 --> 01:29:34,263
You must be Jonah.

1121
01:29:35,128 --> 01:29:37,910
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
Is your mom home?

1122
01:29:38,296 --> 01:29:40,151
Yeah, come in. Mom!

1123
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:49,358
- A woman's here to see you.
- I know.

1124
01:29:49,496 --> 01:29:50,511
Go to your room.

1125
01:29:50,584 --> 01:29:52,013
Go to your room!

1126
01:30:17,816 --> 01:30:18,896
I'm Carla.

1127
01:30:19,608 --> 01:30:20,786
I know who you are.

1128
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,545
This is a very nice house that you have.

1129
01:30:29,816 --> 01:30:30,962
Please sit down.

1130
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:32,237
Thank you.

1131
01:30:41,528 --> 01:30:43,667
I'm sorry to bother you like this...

1132
01:30:43,769 --> 01:30:46,419
...but I thought that it would be good
if we talked.

1133
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:55,255
I called the hospital.

1134
01:30:55,545 --> 01:30:57,912
They said that Max is doing okay.

1135
01:30:58,873 --> 01:31:00,782
I don't think he's doing okay.

1136
01:31:08,633 --> 01:31:09,778
How are you?

1137
01:31:10,616 --> 01:31:11,510
I'm okay.

1138
01:31:11,672 --> 01:31:13,330
I really wasn't hurt.

1139
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,535
You know, I came by because I...

1140
01:31:20,153 --> 01:31:22,422
...I just wanted to say, you know...

1141
01:31:24,632 --> 01:31:27,764
...I can imagine what you must be feeling...

1142
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,327
...about what has happened.

1143
01:31:29,432 --> 01:31:30,480
Really?

1144
01:31:33,272 --> 01:31:34,200
You can?

1145
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,476
You have every right to be angry with me.

1146
01:31:39,576 --> 01:31:41,300
I'm not angry with you.

1147
01:31:41,784 --> 01:31:44,205
Why should I be? Wasn't it Max's idea?

1148
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,509
- What he did was crazy.
- He must be very much in love with you...

1149
01:31:47,576 --> 01:31:49,365
...to risk his life for you.
- It's not like that.

1150
01:31:49,432 --> 01:31:50,480
Isn't that love?

1151
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:51,316
No.

1152
01:31:59,128 --> 01:32:00,884
Look, I'm sorry.

1153
01:32:02,296 --> 01:32:04,205
I didn't come to argue with you.

1154
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:07,151
I think I better go. I'm sorry.

1155
01:32:07,993 --> 01:32:09,138
Please stay.

1156
01:32:24,984 --> 01:32:27,056
I am very sorry about your little boy.

1157
01:32:33,432 --> 01:32:34,447
Thank you.

1158
01:32:41,049 --> 01:32:42,063
You know...

1159
01:32:44,344 --> 01:32:45,653
...when he died...

1160
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,789
...I had nothing.

1161
01:32:49,752 --> 01:32:51,378
I couldn't feel anything.

1162
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,099
Now I can feel something.

1163
01:32:59,225 --> 01:33:02,323
I can feel something inside
besides the pain for Bubble.

1164
01:33:04,633 --> 01:33:06,159
That's because of Max.

1165
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:08,439
He would talk to me.

1166
01:33:08,504 --> 01:33:11,090
He'd talk to me like nobody else ever has.

1167
01:33:11,769 --> 01:33:14,190
We would have these great conversations...

1168
01:33:14,296 --> 01:33:17,460
...and they were weird,
but they were so exciting and...

1169
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:22,255
It's not what you think.

1170
01:33:23,672 --> 01:33:24,883
He's my friend.

1171
01:33:26,136 --> 01:33:28,853
He's my best friend.
It's like God sent him to me.

1172
01:33:28,952 --> 01:33:30,959
It's like he sent me my own angel.

1173
01:33:36,217 --> 01:33:37,907
Let me be honest with you.

1174
01:33:41,752 --> 01:33:44,403
Maybe this wonderful friendship
that you have...

1175
01:33:45,176 --> 01:33:46,769
...might have helped you.

1176
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:49,202
But it hasn't helped Max.

1177
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,563
Maybe our marriage is over...

1178
01:33:53,784 --> 01:33:57,046
...but I have a son
and I want him to have a father.

1179
01:34:01,752 --> 01:34:03,607
Max is not an angel.

1180
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:05,676
He's a man.

1181
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:09,331
He cannot survive up there.

1182
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,895
Hey, you.

1183
01:34:35,033 --> 01:34:36,560
How're you doing?

1184
01:34:37,624 --> 01:34:39,599
I got you these chocolates.

1185
01:34:39,673 --> 01:34:41,582
That's what they give patients.

1186
01:34:42,392 --> 01:34:43,341
Here.

1187
01:34:44,792 --> 01:34:46,385
- How's your head?
- Hurts!

1188
01:34:49,336 --> 01:34:50,284
I just...

1189
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:54,574
I've really wanted to tell you how much...

1190
01:35:00,793 --> 01:35:03,159
I just wanted to say
how wonderful you are.

1191
01:35:04,441 --> 01:35:05,870
You look happy.

1192
01:35:07,736 --> 01:35:10,191
You know, it's probably
because Manny moved out.

1193
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:12,178
I told him to.

1194
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,291
Are you all right with that?

1195
01:35:16,888 --> 01:35:18,001
You know...

1196
01:35:18,264 --> 01:35:20,020
...I visited Bubble's grave.

1197
01:35:21,784 --> 01:35:23,759
For the first time, it was okay.

1198
01:35:25,432 --> 01:35:26,414
I'm glad.

1199
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:32,240
But you know...

1200
01:35:33,912 --> 01:35:36,367
...things can't go back
to the way that they were.

1201
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:39,191
You know what I mean?

1202
01:35:43,289 --> 01:35:44,914
I want you to go home, Max.

1203
01:35:46,169 --> 01:35:47,794
I want you to live again.

1204
01:35:49,816 --> 01:35:51,409
I'm not a ghost anymore.

1205
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,894
I can't get back.

1206
01:35:57,656 --> 01:35:58,801
Yes, you can.

1207
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:01,237
I don't want to.

1208
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,146
I wish I could help you.

1209
01:36:11,129 --> 01:36:12,754
We could disappear, Carla.

1210
01:36:16,185 --> 01:36:17,429
I can't anymore.

1211
01:36:19,832 --> 01:36:20,780
I'm back.

1212
01:36:22,424 --> 01:36:25,174
I want to try living
on planet Earth for a while.

1213
01:36:27,832 --> 01:36:30,036
You can't save everybody, Max.

1214
01:36:32,664 --> 01:36:34,803
You got to try taking care of yourself.

1215
01:36:42,168 --> 01:36:43,477
Say good-bye, Max.

1216
01:36:45,208 --> 01:36:47,347
Good-bye? Why do we have
to say good-bye?

1217
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:53,166
It has to be that way.

1218
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:55,919
I don't want to say good-bye.

1219
01:36:58,392 --> 01:36:59,341
Just...

1220
01:37:01,624 --> 01:37:03,631
Just say it like it means nothing.

1221
01:37:05,784 --> 01:37:06,962
Good-bye, Max.

1222
01:37:20,345 --> 01:37:21,424
Please, Max.

1223
01:37:22,456 --> 01:37:23,438
Say it.

1224
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:28,662
Good-bye, Carla.

1225
01:40:09,848 --> 01:40:12,532
"The soul comes to the end
of it's long journey...

1226
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,931
"...and naked and alone...

1227
01:40:15,577 --> 01:40:17,486
"...draws near to the divine."

1228
01:41:14,552 --> 01:41:15,762
How're you feeling?

1229
01:41:19,576 --> 01:41:20,558
Okay.

1230
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:24,883
101.4.

1231
01:41:27,032 --> 01:41:27,980
Let's see.

1232
01:41:38,104 --> 01:41:39,511
Are you going to stay?

1233
01:41:41,144 --> 01:41:42,737
I don't know. We'll see.

1234
01:41:46,808 --> 01:41:48,466
Sorry about the video game.

1235
01:41:49,784 --> 01:41:51,606
It's okay. You didn't break it.

1236
01:41:53,528 --> 01:41:54,357
Good.

1237
01:43:08,889 --> 01:43:10,165
What is it?

1238
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,916
I want you to save me.

1239
01:43:39,961 --> 01:43:41,368
These are for you.

1240
01:43:42,264 --> 01:43:43,671
You're here! Great.

1241
01:43:43,736 --> 01:43:45,711
Listen, it may be premature.

1242
01:43:45,848 --> 01:43:49,809
I don't want to jinx it but I think
I'll have it all locked up tomorrow.

1243
01:43:50,328 --> 01:43:53,328
So, champagne, assorted goodies.
A little celebration.

1244
01:43:53,912 --> 01:43:55,472
It's an incredible story.

1245
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,470
Because of your suicide attempt,
don't argue that...

1246
01:43:59,769 --> 01:44:03,795
That's how I presented it, that you were
suffering from post-traumatic stress...

1247
01:44:03,896 --> 01:44:07,442
...and that they were going to be
on the hook if you killed yourself.

1248
01:44:07,704 --> 01:44:09,165
I know, I'm terrible.

1249
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,444
What a situation.

1250
01:44:11,512 --> 01:44:13,006
What am I going to do?

1251
01:44:13,688 --> 01:44:15,281
It's incredible!

1252
01:44:15,673 --> 01:44:20,244
Anyway, today I hondled with InterCity's
lawyer for two hours and we got close...

1253
01:44:20,664 --> 01:44:24,788
...really close, to big dollars for you,
Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Rodrigo.

1254
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,789
But I think we're going to make out
like bandits.

1255
01:44:28,024 --> 01:44:30,413
I know, I'm horrible, but listen to this:

1256
01:44:32,056 --> 01:44:33,714
An hour after the call...

1257
01:44:33,784 --> 01:44:36,817
...from the airline lawyer,
I get one from the insurance carrier.

1258
01:44:37,464 --> 01:44:38,708
What a situation!

1259
01:44:38,776 --> 01:44:41,459
I'm mean, I know.
I'm terrible to take advantage...

1260
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,211
...but there's been a fuck up
in their communication.

1261
01:44:44,312 --> 01:44:48,174
They both think they're the one
who's been designated to deal with me.

1262
01:44:48,888 --> 01:44:50,164
So I played dumb.

1263
01:44:51,353 --> 01:44:55,379
Started doing numbers with
the insurance guy and his offer is higher!

1264
01:44:57,561 --> 01:44:59,383
Millions, we're talking millions!

1265
01:45:00,856 --> 01:45:01,871
Oh, shit!

1266
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,793
This is it.

1267
01:45:12,344 --> 01:45:14,199
This is the moment of my death.

1268
01:45:21,528 --> 01:45:22,870
We'll make it, Max.

1269
01:45:22,936 --> 01:45:24,463
He's going to bring us in.

1270
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:27,088
- He'll bring us in.
- There's a boy alone up there.

1271
01:45:28,216 --> 01:45:29,940
I'm going to sit with him.

1272
01:45:32,344 --> 01:45:33,838
It's going to be okay.

1273
01:47:15,416 --> 01:47:16,725
Everything's okay.

1274
01:47:25,305 --> 01:47:26,865
Now, put your head down.

1275
01:47:29,432 --> 01:47:30,774
Close your eyes.

1276
01:47:31,352 --> 01:47:33,011
It'll be over soon.

1277
01:47:34,328 --> 01:47:36,216
Everything's wonderful.

1278
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,003
In the kitchen, there is a phone!

1279
01:48:54,744 --> 01:48:56,980
It's an emergency! It's an allergic reaction!

1280
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,546
Stop it! What's happening? Dad!

1281
01:49:42,552 --> 01:49:43,665
No, Max! No!

1282
01:50:40,824 --> 01:50:42,133
I'm alive!

1283
01:50:45,849 --> 01:50:46,863
I'm alive!

1284
01:51:01,848 --> 01:51:03,026
I'm alive!
