1
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:18,101
"TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR YOU"

2
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,953
I understand, sir.
I'd help you if I could.

3
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,752
I'll even lend you a car.

4
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,915
I'm the temp.

5
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,069
I called the factory!
No cars that colour for a month!

6
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,435
Can I help you?

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,629
I'm the secretary...

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,912
Go in the back office.
Through the corridor.

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,079
I handled your order.
The problem is...

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,271
you cancelled it.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,638
You phoned me personally...
I'm not crazy.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,436
You said, " Forget the bronze,
I want royal blue now."

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,074
That's what you told me last
night.

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,909
This morning you say
you thought it over

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,998
you'll take the bronze.
But that car's gone.

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,838
I sold it to someone else.

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,916
Sorry, that guy's a pest.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,079
- Bernard Barthelemy.
- Colette Chevassus.

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,873
She is very nice...

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,954
Maybe beautiful isn't
the word...but nice.

21
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,832
lmagine...a woman

22
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,033
who is always seeking...
to be even more of a woman...

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,593
more noticed...

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,199
more desired...

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,199
Who is always looking
for something...

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,996
Pushing back the frontiers...

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,033
What frontiers?

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,988
Of modesty.

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,759
Modesty is essential for a woman.

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,636
Pushing modesty back
doesn't mean...it vanishes.

31
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,318
It just...recedes.

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,154
It stumbles...

33
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,599
catches itself...

34
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,152
Right now, for example,

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,356
even though I know you all,

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,357
you're looking at me,
and I'm scared.

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,474
Scared of what?

38
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,996
Of what I'm going to say...

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,077
Of what...
I want to say to you.

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,831
What are you going to say?

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,914
Everything.

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,432
What's "everything" ?

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,358
Is there a point to this?

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,312
Of course. Look!

45
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,876
My hands are already shaking...

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,596
just from thinking
of what I'm going to say.

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,517
I'm already shivering...

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,475
It's...

49
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,353
a pleasure.

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,998
Ask your questions.

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,833
What questions?

52
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,553
Your questions about me.

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,759
Concerning what?

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,509
What a bitch!

55
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,438
What a magnificent bitch!

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,759
Don't turn your back on me now.

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,956
After eyeing me for 5 days,
you turn your back.

58
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,596
That's a lousy way to act.

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,270
I want to...touch your skin.

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,835
Come on.

61
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,396
Turn around now, huh?

62
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,154
You won't be mean,

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,958
you'll turn around.

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,989
It's lovely waiting for a man...

65
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,552
You can't tell a stranger,

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,320
" I want to be
in a bedroom with you" !

67
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,312
It isn't done!

68
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,793
And why not?

69
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,039
What if you suddenly said it?
Would it bother anyone?

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,593
A bedroom. That's all

71
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,754
It's...hard to say...
What I'd like to say to you.

72
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,232
I don't have the nerve.

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,839
Let's do some work.

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,670
Yes...We'll work...

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,549
Good idea...

76
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,351
What'd you want to tell me?

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,110
It was about...your eyes.

78
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,918
They hurt me...

79
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,112
They disturb me, destabilize me.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,799
They please me, too.

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,557
She is a bit of a slob...

82
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,672
I tend to ignore that...

83
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,348
You're falling in love, old girl.

84
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,159
And hard!

85
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,838
If one could only
make them all happy.

86
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,312
Give them all flowers.

87
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,394
Exactly what's going on between
us?

88
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,999
You have big hands.

89
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,558
Mechanic's hands.

90
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,791
I like mechanic's hands.

91
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,670
It's your mouth I like.

92
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,468
My mouth?

93
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,239
Yes... Your mouth.

94
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,678
What about my mouth?

95
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,276
I like this woman!

96
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,591
Do you like the music?

97
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,834
What music?

98
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,994
Don't you hear music?

99
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,829
Where?

100
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,079
In the house.

101
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,317
There's music in the house?

102
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,108
What's this music?

103
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,878
A Schubert impromptu.

104
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,074
Did you buy it?

105
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,795
- Why?
- What do you mean, "why" ?

106
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,197
You heard me!
I asked you why?

107
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,110
He has to do an essay
on Schubert for his music class.

108
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,755
An essay?

109
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,997
An essay! His life, work,
influence.

110
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,596
But this music shatters me!

111
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,192
Suddenly, a spark, deliverance,
a door opens,

112
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,075
it all falls into place,
I know all the why's and how's.

113
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,353
I'd lost faith, and there it was,
after so much plodding.

114
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,752
It flows in a steady stream,
no crossing out.

115
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,235
A spring I thought was dry
came to life.

116
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,876
No fatigue, no anxiety,
no wish to eat, or piss.

117
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,389
Hours later I was still writing...

118
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,032
How can it be?

119
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,678
How can it be?

120
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,750
How can it be?

121
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,555
It can, that's all.
Some guys are lucky!

122
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,798
Bernard's a lucky stiff.

123
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,115
Why a lucky stiff?

124
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,757
Why a lucky stiff?
His wife, dammit!

125
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,395
Thanks.

126
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,515
I'll say it no matter what happens:
she gives me a hard on.

127
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,391
At first I didn't much
care if we made love...

128
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,671
Remember, on the train?

129
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,510
I just felt good, I was near you...

130
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,792
I felt good, too.

131
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,949
I could've changed my life then
gone away, anywhere.

132
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,390
- With me?
- Of course!

133
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,751
Why didn't you?

134
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,468
I still believed in life then.
I vibrated.

135
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,719
I vibrated too.

136
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,996
Everything around me reeled.

137
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,598
Where to go?

138
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,158
I felt bad, I felt good.

139
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,312
I recognized nothing.

140
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,668
Not my house...

141
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,439
nor my happiness.

142
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,639
I felt like a thief.

143
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,668
What's going on?

144
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,349
A visit...

145
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,113
an early-bird visit.

146
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,676
You're not the early-bird type.

147
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,593
I am this morning.

148
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,072
She the temp?

149
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,350
You came to inspect the temp?

150
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,159
Feel easier, now?

151
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,191
You bet!

152
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,235
I mustn't laugh,
she'll think it's at her.

153
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,158
Why make fun of her?

154
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,791
I'm not making fun of her.

155
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,598
You spying on me now?

156
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,434
Spying on you?

157
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,191
You show up unannounced,
which you never do. I call that spying!

158
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,319
Get me some coffee?

159
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,200
Of course I'll get you some coffee.

160
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,750
Do me a favour,
bring us two coffees.

161
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,393
Right away, sir.

162
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,076
What's the matter, love?

163
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,555
You seem so sad!

164
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,869
I'm scared.

165
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,149
Of what?

166
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,999
I suddenly had to see you,
touch you.

167
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,479
I love you, you know.

168
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,434
Not like at first.
I love you more than at first.

169
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,198
I love you, too.

170
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,108
Excuse me.

171
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,674
Maybe she thinks
I'm your mistress.

172
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,918
What nonsense?

173
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,788
I tell you she looked at me oddly.

174
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,353
Oddly?

175
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,233
Wait, I'll be right back.

176
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,839
What're you going to do?

177
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,399
Wait, I'll be back.

178
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,518
I'm Florence Barthelemy.

179
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,675
Colette Chevassus.

180
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,993
Wait for me!
What are you doing?

181
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,074
You out of your mind?

182
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,030
Cheating on her with me!
She has it all, I have nothing!

183
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,313
What do you see in me? Charm?
I'd have to be loaded with it!

184
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,235
Can't you leave me alone?
You can see I'm groggy!

185
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,998
Beauty clobbers you!
It hurts!

186
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,679
I want to know you.

187
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,795
I've no hidden treasures.
What you see is what you get.

188
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,516
We need to be together,
even if that's dumb.

189
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,035
The dumb things
in life are the best.

190
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,951
They decided to meet
discreetly in a motel

191
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,798
on a main highway.

192
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,431
Practical things, motels.

193
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,868
You park, no fuss, you're instantly
inside, in the person's arms.

194
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,476
It mostly happens at lunchtime.

195
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,433
Lots of folks aren't hungry
at lunchtime.

196
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,239
See all these cars?

197
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,989
These people aren't hungry.

198
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,915
I'm not...hungry either.

199
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,757
Remember this image

200
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,799
The man sitting on the bed,
against the light...

201
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,196
How big the room looks,

202
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,471
and how far away he seems.

203
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,830
I have to tell you, Bernard

204
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,039
I'm savouring my fondest memory.

205
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,357
There'll be others later,
but this one's the loveliest.

206
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,349
My fondest memory...is you
of stepping out of the shadow,

207
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,192
and coming toward me.

208
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,951
You're sure you want me?

209
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,790
If not it'd be too lousy.

210
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,393
I'm falling hard.

211
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,119
She's a nobody.
This'll be over quickly.

212
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,678
- do I know her?
- No.

213
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,477
- Is she beautiful?
- No.

214
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,159
Is she tacky?

215
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,879
She's plain.

216
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,713
She can't be, if you're
screwing her! Don't you screw her?

217
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,069
I do.

218
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,315
How is it?

219
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,594
Terrific?

220
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,151
Does she do things I can't?

221
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,074
Damn! You make me want to cry!

222
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,276
Who is this girl?
What's so special about her?

223
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,710
I have to know or I can't fight
back!

224
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,349
Stop!

225
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,149
I'll stop.

226
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,549
Stop, I said!

227
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,309
It's not me, it's my ass.
It ignores my orders.

228
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,590
Look, it's moving on its own.

229
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,870
Tell it to calm down, please.

230
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,915
Why? Don't you like
my little caress?

231
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,392
It's a caress for you.

232
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,117
I don't have to move much.

233
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,193
Ever so little...

234
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,039
Like so.

235
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,109
Terribly...gently...

236
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,709
Stop...

237
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,229
I'll stop.

238
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,959
Do it some more.

239
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,473
I'll do it some more.

240
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,119
I've just made love for 3 hours.

241
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,470
I've still got nervous cramps.

242
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,313
Why tell me all this?

243
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,476
Happiness! A gift! Sharing!

244
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,833
This is my house.
Which I must now enter!

245
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,832
- See her today?
- No.

246
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,832
Then why are you bathing?
You bathe every evening.

247
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,998
Her smell? I'm like a hooker:
smells don't scare me.

248
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,990
Where do you screw her? A hotel?
Are you discreet, at least?

249
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,275
Florence...

250
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,392
Yes, I'm Florence.
I'm your wife.

251
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,672
Got anything to tell me?

252
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,237
Music again?

253
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,073
A Schubert quartet.

254
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,195
That's all we need at meals.
So appetizing.

255
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,670
It's romantic music.
It's not supposed to be cheery.

256
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,359
There are limits.

257
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,836
Listen

258
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,275
What'd Schubert have in mind
writing such sad music?

259
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,072
He was sick and unhappy.

260
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,871
He got that across!
Great atmosphere!

261
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,996
Your essay almost finished?

262
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,997
If not, I'll have to talk
to your music teacher!

263
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,590
Let's pretend she's your wife
and I'm your lover!

264
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,633
Can't we try?

265
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,511
Why do such women excite us?

266
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,517
Why should this one,
who has nothing exciting about her,

267
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,956
suddenly knock us for a loop?

268
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,952
A love affair is like art

269
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,119
a spark, lots of patience,
and the patina of time.

270
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,955
A spark, deliverance,
a door opens,

271
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,836
it all falls into place,
I know all the why's and how's.

272
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,110
I had lost faith,
and there it was,

273
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,992
after so much plodding.

274
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,269
My love!

275
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,438
It flows in a steady stream,

276
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,599
with no crossing out, a spring
I thought was dry came to life.

277
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,836
No fatigue, no anxiety,
no wish to eat,

278
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,554
or piss. Hours later
I was still writing.

279
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,228
I almost missed your train!

280
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,316
My love!

281
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,469
Morning, Mrs. Delteil.

282
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,319
Morning, Mrs. Chevassus.

283
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,873
Feeling cheerier?

284
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,073
I try to keep going.

285
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,799
I'm here if you need me.

286
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,351
Thanks. You're sweet.

287
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,950
She doesn't look so hot, huh?

288
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,918
Sure, she never goes out.

289
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,234
Just waits, weeping,
for the phone to ring.

290
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,511
Excuse me... It's absurd...

291
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,033
I'm still hoping,
I can't give him up.

292
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,038
Some guys are bastards!
Deserting a woman like her!

293
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,671
Maybe she's too beautiful.

294
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,678
Too beautiful?

295
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,228
I mean

296
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,312
too sublime. Too ideal.

297
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,077
What's left to desire
when you live with that gem?

298
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,639
You have it all!

299
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,479
What else can you hope for?
Nothing!

300
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,714
To die.

301
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,315
I can't just turn into a fat slob!

302
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,359
Oh, it's you, Mom.

303
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,749
Yeah, it's me.

304
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,234
It's my mother.

305
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,152
I'm in the middle of dinner.
No, never mind...

306
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,432
Yes, I'm listening...

307
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,678
What can I say?

308
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,198
It can't be helped!

309
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,198
You heard the doctor...

310
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,395
I must know you.

311
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,795
What does " knowing"
a woman mean?

312
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,359
It's like music. You learn
the notes, then you play.

313
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,230
I don't get music. I'm like
a blind man when I hear it.

314
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,237
But whenever a smile
walks by, I catch it!

315
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,352
I don't let it fly away.

316
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,515
So where does your screwing
around leave me?

317
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,831
Pascal, we have to talk.

318
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,238
I need to talk to you.

319
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,392
Something's happened.

320
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,678
Something disturbing.

321
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,156
Pascal I have to talk to you!

322
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,270
You don't want me to touch you?

323
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,040
Listen, I have a problem.

324
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,111
I can feel you're tense.

325
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,151
I'm tense, my nerves are raw,
in fact I'm all upset, Pascal!

326
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,233
What's your problem?

327
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,272
It's a love problem.

328
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,598
How do you explain that,
Marcello?

329
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,994
Marcello don't explain.
Women he don't explain.

330
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,230
Shall I tell you of my desire?

331
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,839
I won't touch you, I'll just
tell you of my desire, OK?

332
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,595
OK.

333
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,191
You can see my hands are
behind my back. They're not moving.

334
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,838
Tell me of your desire.

335
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,078
It's a desire...for pleasure.

336
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,719
For the pleasure you'll give me...

337
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,433
drop by drop...

338
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,873
just by...letting your
veins throb...inside me...

339
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,309
And l...

340
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,793
I'll spit you sweetly
into your mouth...

341
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,479
I love you...

342
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,835
Don't say " I love you".
Just be quiet and listen to me.

343
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,350
I'm talking about my desire.

344
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,356
I want to be on top of you.

345
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,314
I want...

346
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,956
to make you explode

347
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,113
in slow motion...

348
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,712
I want to make your heart burst...
with impatience.

349
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,108
I want to bring you...
to a point where...coming...

350
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,789
for you...

351
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,115
will become so...

352
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,758
I want to stay here.

353
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,510
I love the rain
when I'm in bed.

354
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,595
As soon as you touch me
I take off...

355
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,396
I don't know what's happening.

356
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,033
Your hands, your fingers are like
nothing I've ever known.

357
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,991
I'm going back to the garage.

358
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,156
I miss you already.

359
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,275
How come we feel so good?

360
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,556
Maybe that's what a couple is...
Something simple...

361
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,676
I'm going back to the garage.

362
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,591
I'd like to live with you.

363
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,752
I'm going back to the garage.

364
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,919
I don't mean for long...
A few days, a few nights.

365
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,952
So it's you!

366
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,632
I'm sorry, Madame...

367
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,191
I feel strange.

368
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,117
I want to cry...

369
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,471
yet I also want to laugh...

370
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,835
Maybe I really want to vomit.

371
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,434
Sit down, meanwhile.

372
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,190
I don't want to sit!
Or chat or have tea!

373
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,155
I'm in a humiliating position

374
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,110
and I don't know
how to get out of it?

375
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,913
Why humiliating? You wanted to
what I look like. Why not?

376
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,472
Well, I don't like your looks.
They're common and ugly!

377
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,750
You have no charm...
not that I can see...

378
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,754
Sorry. The words slip out.
I'm vile!

379
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,320
What did you do to attract him?

380
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,957
It wasn't love at first sight?

381
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,879
A woman who gives love

382
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,838
ends up being loved.

383
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,113
ldiot! You don't know what
it is to turn a man's head!

384
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,313
All men are at my feet,
including Bernard.

385
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,273
I snap my fingers
and he comes! He's my guy!

386
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,628
Can you lend him to me a bit
He likes it with me.

387
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,435
He's calm. He rests.
I'll return him to you like new...

388
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,552
You can start all over again.

389
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,917
You ought to go home.

390
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,472
I'd like...to dress
and leave this room.

391
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,315
Is that what you use?

392
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,555
How dare you!

393
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,990
Well? What's your
gimmick with men?

394
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,593
Take it easy!

395
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,758
I'll explain it to you.

396
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,033
Getting things going
is the hardest...

397
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,674
arousing their curiosity...
it's always pretty mild.

398
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,471
Men sense that...
I'm somehow worth the effort.

399
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,674
But they think, "She's too crummy,
people will laugh at me".

400
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,909
Usually they just think
about it and do nothing...

401
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,678
They go their way.

402
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,514
But sometimes one of them
stops...

403
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,713
He's curious...and vulnerable.

404
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,833
Bernard's vulnerable,
even if he seems tough.

405
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,998
When they feel 40 coming,
it destabilizes them,

406
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,911
they become kids again.

407
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,071
But you're so beautiful...

408
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,792
Why are you so beautiful?

409
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,198
I want you to fire
that floozy at once!

410
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,277
- Why "floozy" ?
- She's unworthy.

411
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,630
Unworthy of you, me, us?

412
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,589
A woman needn't be beautiful,
she just has to be a woman.

413
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,719
I call her a whore!

414
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,869
A shitty secretary who fucks
her boss to get ahead!

415
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,710
Don't look at me like that,
you heard me! A slut, a little slut!

416
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,554
I apologize, Florence.

417
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,150
I'd like to be her,
dumpy like her!

418
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,638
What's with the music?

419
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,555
It's specifically for you!

420
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,752
To welcome you home.
When you deign to return.

421
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,109
I don't want music.

422
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,799
Well, I do!

423
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,755
As a kid I never heard music.
Now I listen to it.

424
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,513
A very lovely lady visited me
today.

425
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,039
- Lovely?
- Very lovely!

426
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,514
What'd she say?

427
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,235
Sit down, I'll tell you about it.

428
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,237
It's simple, you'll see.

429
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,759
I was alone and miserable.

430
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,554
Miserable!

431
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,517
Thinking, " I screwed it all up...

432
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,076
my life, my novel,
all down the drain."

433
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,111
That's what I was thinking!

434
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,036
Just then the doorbell rang.

435
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,593
Someone?

436
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,112
Please come in, Madam...

437
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,832
Care for a drink?

438
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,352
There she was, saying nothing,

439
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,591
she seemed a broken woman!

440
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,159
That's her!

441
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,514
See what you've done?
The harm you've done?

442
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,950
Gorgeous women create havoc!

443
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,755
Yeah... They do!

444
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,392
This is where I step in.

445
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,831
I haven't said much so far,
but now I step in.

446
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,995
Marcello's nice, a terrific guy!

447
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,911
They'll be delighted...

448
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,799
The sun was invented by an
ltalian.

449
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,598
So was opera.

450
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,356
Terrific guy, Marcello.

451
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,999
What'd I tell you?

452
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,793
It's funny...

453
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,758
I don't desire her.

454
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,556
How come I don't desire her?

455
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,472
It's the first time.

456
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,714
We don't always have to screw.

457
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,590
We're fine like this,
in our little hideaway.

458
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,511
I'm thinking of your ass.
What'll it say if we ignore it?

459
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,232
lt'll sulk a bit, that's for sure.

460
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,989
I'll explain things to it, say
" it's not serious,

461
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,071
you have to let up now and then".

462
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,911
A love affair is like
a football game

463
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,397
there has to be a half time.

464
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,790
You rest, look at each other,
and then start over...

465
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,877
Will you toss me aside
when you're tired of me?

466
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,232
I love you, idiot!

467
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,835
You don't love me.

468
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,034
You screw me

469
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,711
I still wonder why.

470
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,155
Probably an old fantasy...
on the ancillary side.

471
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,917
Or else you're dumb.

472
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,557
Maybe that's the reason.
Dumb like a real boss.

473
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,478
What does "ancillary" mean?

474
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,148
It's an affair
with a servant woman.

475
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,549
From the Latin "ancilla",
a female servant.

476
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,952
Once you've screwed her
you throw her out.

477
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,995
Know what shatters me about
you?

478
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,272
That you're shattered.

479
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,552
How do you know I am?

480
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,356
I don't feel like going home.

481
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,879
OK, we got it!

482
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,196
We're in the same boat, kid.

483
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,231
Where've you been, you bastard?
Screwing again?

484
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,837
I can't face this dinner.

485
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,593
Why not?

486
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,313
I'm in love, Florence.
Understand?

487
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,389
In love!

488
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,558
Who's that guy?

489
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,275
A pianist, my love.

490
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,597
Why's he in my house?

491
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,673
Why're you in my house?

492
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,915
Dad!

493
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,316
What the matter, son?

494
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,351
I want to be a musician.

495
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,831
Music hurts.
It breaks your heart.

496
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,514
If a woman no longer loves you,

497
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,352
Pierre-Alain thought,

498
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,435
what stops you
from loving her anyway?

499
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,149
Huh?

500
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,751
What stops you?
What stops you?

501
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,838
Do I type that 3 times?

502
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,792
Type it as often as you like.

503
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,714
Why are you wearing a white
dress?

504
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,676
I always wear white dresses.

505
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,908
I've worn white dresses
for 1 4 years.

506
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,198
I've never told you...

507
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,834
you see, I've been polite...

508
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,390
But now I must: for 1 4 years
I've wanted to eat your pussy.

509
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,348
1 4 years...

510
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,508
every night...how many nights?
I've gone to sleep thinking

511
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,679
" Florence Barthelemy
just sat down on my mouth!"

512
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,955
What if tonight we all say
what we think?

513
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,993
Terrific, huh?

514
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,669
Of course...
you never get steamed up.

515
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,678
When I suggest anything
you look pained.

516
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,114
You're the pain!
Look how uptight you are!

517
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,359
You wouldn't be half bad
if you tried, but you don't!

518
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,316
Why isn't my wife like her?

519
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,036
Why is mine so drab?
My God she's drab!

520
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,758
Why'd she slap me?

521
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,914
Why'd she slap me?

522
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,879
You cheat on your wife.
That's all you deserve.

523
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,470
That's for my wife to decide.
Let her slap me.

524
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,351
Florence, say something!

525
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,759
I can slap too! I'll pick
someone and knock his head off.

526
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,871
We're all very nervous.

527
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,878
We're all very nervous.

528
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,952
Why's she crying?

529
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,991
What's she got to cry about?

530
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,430
Who can have parties anymore?

531
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,233
I know it's all over!
No more parties!

532
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,433
You're being ridiculous!

533
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,551
Don't touch me, please!

534
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,438
You're watching
a little group split up!

535
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,431
Happiness flitting away.
What an atmosphere!

536
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,798
Because an idiot rocked
the foundations.

537
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,919
The building was ready to cave in!

538
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,515
We were friends.
We made pots of money.

539
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,756
In winter we skied, in summer...
we sailed...Now what's left?

540
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,956
I have something to say.

541
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,998
Speech!

542
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,955
It's a speech...about love.

543
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,071
Love and friendship.

544
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,678
I'm happy...to be alive.

545
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,150
Those of you I don't know,
I'm happy to know.

546
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,030
We're going to spend the best
years of our lives together.

547
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,397
My God she's lovely!

548
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,116
Look at that bitch!

549
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,839
I know some think...
I'm a bit too beautiful.

550
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,278
I see it in their eyes.

551
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,270
To all those...and to the rest...
I apologize.

552
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,156
Beauty...doesn't mean much,
you know.

553
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,791
I'm a woman like any other.

554
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,992
I quiver...l get upset...

555
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,070
Men push me over and take me...

556
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,116
Tonight Bernard will do it.

557
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,268
Tonight...

558
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,596
and all the nights that follow.

559
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,951
I've had few lovers.

560
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,278
A few, while waiting.

561
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,518
They didn't damage me.

562
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,799
They just...soared over me.

563
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,112
Now I intend...

564
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,197
to let myself be probed
more violently...

565
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,756
Any more questions?

566
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,436
No one's asking questions, dear.

567
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,154
Go ahead.

568
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,079
Ask your question.

569
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,351
Where'd she come from?

570
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,390
A crasher!

571
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,077
Let her talk, dammit!

572
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,192
I worked at City Hall...

573
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,834
I've...just been fired.

574
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,478
I loved weddings...
the lavish ones.

575
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,234
Now you know everything.

576
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,912
Now and then I slip in...

577
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,595
I'm taken for a cousin...
a distant relative...

578
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,871
and I look at the bride.

579
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,231
Give her some champagne.

580
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,718
She's a scream!

581
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,512
She's like my sister.

582
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,753
What sister?

583
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,432
The one I never had.

584
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,710
I would like to propose a toast...

585
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,750
to wish you...every happiness...

586
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,639
The happiness I don't have,
and never will.

587
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,637
But I haven't the strength.

588
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,912
I can be beautiful too...

589
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,231
It's an inner beauty...

590
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,794
But it's as good
as any other kind...

591
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,476
if you know how to look for it.

592
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,716
Excuse me, I don't feel well...

593
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,189
Don't make fun of her.

594
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,073
No one's making fun of her.
Why should we?

595
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,590
She's unhappy, she needs help.

596
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,309
Sorry, guess I vomited on your rug.

597
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,112
Take my rug, leave my man!

598
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,198
Right...It's a pretty rug...

599
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,630
Pure wool,
the only kind that lasts.

600
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,519
I'm going home...

601
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,353
That's good thinking!

602
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,233
- Everyone keeps his nose clean.
- Right!

603
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,193
I had a coat and purse...

604
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,193
- I'll take her...
- Marcello will take her home.

605
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,913
On his big bike.

606
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,669
Marcello's sweet.

607
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,395
You bet! I even lend them
my place for siestas.

608
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,635
You jerk!

609
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,034
Did I say something dumb?

610
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,958
Take her home!

611
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,673
- Why the panic?
- me? panic?

612
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,950
Yes, you!
Why're you pushing me?

613
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,272
Stop it!
Want me to push you?

614
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,475
Everyone knows
you're screwing me!

615
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,878
I'm the fill-in secretary,
Colette Chevassus,

616
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,957
who likes getting humped!

617
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,590
I was passing by,
walking my dog.

618
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,396
There were lights,
laughter, partying...

619
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,710
I couldn't help coming in.

620
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,033
Got a drink for a girl
who's all shook up?

621
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,988
She the one?

622
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,395
She's the one.

623
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,671
I don't like these people.

624
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,111
This woman you see here,

625
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,677
who you think is ordinary...

626
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,834
If you knew how she makes love...

627
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,714
Or, rather,

628
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,319
if you knew how she gives love!

629
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,518
Love, you guys...

630
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,398
Genuine love!

631
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,991
We see each other every day.

632
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,996
Every day a day of joy...

633
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,753
We're drunk with it.

634
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,149
When you don't know anymore
who you are

635
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,591
or where you are,
all that counts is...

636
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,955
her skin,

637
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,395
her mouth,

638
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,678
her eyelids closing...

639
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,989
the wonder in her smile

640
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,035
when pleasure floods over her.

641
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,434
Nicely put.

642
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,835
Why not say it?

643
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,438
Why always lie?

644
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,758
The woman who gave
birth holding my hand...

645
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,792
who gave me a smile with the
deserves to be told.

646
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,594
I respect her
and tell her everything!

647
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,109
She understands me.

648
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,951
Otherwise love would be shit!

649
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,552
A prison of shit!

650
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,359
Go away with her...

651
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,239
What do you mean?

652
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,239
Live with her a while.
Take a trip.

653
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,396
I have a little house down south.
It was my parents'.

654
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,155
Like it?

655
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,315
We'll hole in, like thieves,

656
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,552
shutters closed,

657
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,590
and make love in every room.

658
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,679
We'll do that...

659
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,912
The jerk's hiding.

660
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,434
Don't worry, it's nerves,

661
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,871
happiness breaking free,

662
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,390
great jolts of happiness.

663
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,873
I'm hurting her...

664
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,438
I'm hurting her...

665
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,437
A woman's dumb,
always going to pieces.

666
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,435
She tries to be a bitch,
then, suddenly, she breaks up!

667
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,830
I feel like making love,
Marcello.

668
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,152
Tell me about your wife,
if you're bored.

669
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,034
I'm not bored.

670
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,639
Yes you are.

671
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,598
We're together barely 2 days
and you're bored.

672
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,671
So talk about your wife.

673
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,749
Alright...

674
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,239
Maybe I was wrong
to put on this old robe.

675
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,118
But I like this old robe.

676
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,597
It's my robe. It's my life!

677
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,032
Poor devil was bored.

678
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,070
"God I'm bored!" he thought.

679
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,431
" How come I'm so bored?

680
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,829
When I think how happy
I've just made that girl."

681
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,476
It was good, you know...
I liked it...

682
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,632
So did l.

683
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,633
More coffee?

684
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,634
Please.

685
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,276
What do they have in their heads?

686
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,395
I'll tell him
I'm going shopping...

687
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,597
I'll get out my old bike.

688
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,077
"What's with the bicycle?"
he'll say, horrified.

689
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,951
"You can't go on a bike!
We'll take the car."

690
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:46,032
" It's my bike," I'll tell him.
"For going shopping."

691
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,508
He won't insist, you'll see.

692
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,471
He'll say, "Hurry",
and when I get back he'll be gone.

693
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,519
Gone in a funk.

694
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,073
What're you doing?

695
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,869
I'm off to buy bread and wine.

696
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,274
On a bike?

697
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,598
Certainly on a bike.

698
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,194
Wait for me.
We'll take the car.

699
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,437
I don't want the car.
I'm happier on my bike.

700
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,392
That's idiotic!

701
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,238
I can't let you go like that!

702
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,548
A man wants to live several lives.

703
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,755
But he can't: he only has one,
and it's short.

704
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,912
She's going to call.

705
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,196
I know she's going to call.

706
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,393
You were right, Pascal:
he just wanted some fun.

707
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,316
He's gone and it's over.

708
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,558
Now I'm coming back.

709
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,433
Coming back home.

710
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,678
I want a baby.

711
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,791
We're going to move...
We'll live up north.

712
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,952
As far north as possible.

713
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,439
In a spot where
there's no sun at all.

714
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,598
Our only sun will be our child.

715
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,159
He'll rise like the sun...

716
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,228
As for us...

717
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,353
we'll drink beer.

718
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,996
Why this craving for beer?

719
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,518
I never drink beer.

720
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,190
The craving of a pregnant woman?
Already?

721
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,430
So young and fat already?

722
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,036
And she thinks it's funny!

723
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,197
Her guy just walked out...

724
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,991
Soon she'll start singing.

725
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,635
I mustn't hum Schubert!
Schubert's not my style.

726
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,196
Bernard...How sweet
of you to come back...

727
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,471
I thought you were angry.

728
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,830
Wait, I'll set your place.

729
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,995
I cooked a chicken
with spring vegetables.

730
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,391
You'll see, sweetheart:
at first it won't be easy...

731
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,039
But you'll get used to it.

732
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,596
You'll like it with me.

733
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,795
I've never been screwed
so well. Never.

734
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,275
How do you manage
to screw me so well?

735
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,239
It just happens.

736
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,913
You're so gentle.

737
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,594
You set it off.

738
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,112
I love you, Bernard.
I'm nuts about you.

739
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,199
I'm a wreck.

740
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,994
It's funny...

741
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,876
I've always known I was plain...
It didn't bother me.

742
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,911
I mean with men...

743
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,592
I always felt fine...

744
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,990
Fine in my body and in my head...

745
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,198
Sure, I've been lovesick,
like everyone.

746
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,318
I'd rather have been beautiful,

747
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,318
I can't deny that.

748
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,748
But...

749
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,628
I've known moments of great
happiness...

750
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,150
Men are wonderful, you know...

751
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,759
when they let go...

752
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,789
when they suddenly become
heavy and defenceless...

753
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,110
A woman's memory is
in her shoulders...

754
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,196
That's where it all happens...

755
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,114
Why have you stopped listening?

756
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,392
There are some people I know.

757
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,192
Is that a problem?

758
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,554
No. Why should it be a problem?

759
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,588
You suddenly seem
uncomfortable...

760
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,393
They're just pals.

761
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,351
- So go say hello to them.
- Why?

762
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,437
Because they're your pals.

763
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,156
No point.
They can see I'm with someone.

764
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,308
That means you can't go say hi?

765
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,393
I'm tired, Colette.

766
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,754
I've screwed too much,
drunk too much...

767
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,954
My mind's on my kids...

768
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,196
Maybe you'd like me to leave?

769
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,351
I'll go say hi to my pals.

770
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,955
Do you mind if I powder my nose?

771
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,033
I mean, really...

772
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:38,199
My nose is shiny...Unlike my future
which doesn't shine at all!

773
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,355
It's dull.

774
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,268
If you leave her, you're a shit!
I'll punch you.

775
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,674
I'll never be a writer!

776
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,952
Yes, you will!
Just keep working at it!

777
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:53,311
lnstead of playing loser!
We're all losers!

778
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,751
I want to be in hotel rooms...
and hooker bars...

779
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,273
Colette and me, it's all over!
You've gotta welcome her home.

780
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,233
She'll be depressed.
I don't want her to be alone.

781
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,193
Wasn't I alone
while she was sucking your cock?

782
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,278
I hope she sucked it!

783
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,313
She sucks mine.
She's very good at it.

784
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,158
Believe me, I'll miss that.

785
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,429
So will l.

786
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,598
She'll find a new cock to suck,
don't worry!

787
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,839
Shitty life...

788
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:32,232
Life isn't shitty...Love is.

789
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,590
Shall I put on some Schubert?

790
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,555
You got some?

791
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,516
Keep me from falling asleep...

792
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,796
Don't let me fall asleep...

793
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,315
Once I'm asleep, you'll leave...

794
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,349
No, I won't.

795
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,393
Me, leave?

796
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,358
Of course, I'll leave.

797
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,717
Stay a bit longer...

798
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,631
A bit longer...

799
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,756
Coward, I'm a coward.

800
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,399
Will you call me now and then?
Tell me how you are?

801
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,629
Coward.

802
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,274
I'm a coward.

803
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,113
The most important thing
in life is to go on living.

804
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,194
I'm a woman who is alive.

805
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,632
Look how alive I am.

806
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,193
This is stupid.

807
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,393
What's the point?

808
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,151
Is it the same room?

809
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,876
The same room?
I don't know.

810
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,918
They're all alike.

811
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,831
I want to talk to you, Bernard.

812
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,588
What about?

813
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,595
About me.

814
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,752
Lie down on the bed.

815
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,599
What for?

816
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,878
Lie down on the bed.

817
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,515
There...I'll sit in the armchair.

818
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,752
Now what happens?

819
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,159
I'm leaving you.

820
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,711
I'm walking out of your life.

821
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,238
No word at all...

822
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,958
Not a phone call...

823
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,035
My only memento is an old pay
slip.

824
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,714
For 4 years all I've done
is fake things...

825
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,434
My smiles, my orgasms, my
moods...

826
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,152
I never feel good.

827
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:49,198
An ice-cold hand
has me pinned to the wall.

828
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,072
I wish that mysterious
hand would disappear.

829
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,155
I'm going to try and run away.

830
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,153
You've met someone?

831
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,919
No, Bernard.

832
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,319
I'm all alone.

833
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,798
I'm all alone, too.

834
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,115
I have a family,
but I'm all alone.

835
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,794
It's weird...

836
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,388
They say having kids
changes a woman.

837
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,233
Hasn't changed me.

838
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:32,711
Florence my love, please,
the nightmare's over!

839
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,958
Be patient, we're cured.

840
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,037
Careful, someone's watching us.

841
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,472
What are you doing here?

842
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,557
You'll catch a cold.
You're not dressed.

843
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,435
Here...

844
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,719
Take my coat.

845
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,070
It's so good to see you...

846
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,472
Wait, don't move.
My wife's splitting.

847
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,517
Florence, wait for me!

848
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,440
I can explain,
it's nothing at all!

849
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,632
Shit, she's gone for good!

850
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,439
Where's she gone?

851
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,556
Colette...my love!

852
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,555
What's up, fella?

853
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,799
Something wrong?

854
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,359
Want some help?

855
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,397
There are kids sleeping!

856
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,598
She took my coat!

857
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,998
She took my coat!

858
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,554
Your Schubert's a pain in the ass!

859
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,188
A goddamn pain!
