CALLS FROM MY LOCAL RESIDENTS

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,000
CLAIMING THAT THEY HAVE
LYME DISEASE.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,901
>> WELL, FRANKLY,
UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:15,634
UNTIL 1975,

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:19,200
THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY HAD NO
IDEA WHAT LYME DISEASE EVEN WAS.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,467
ALL WE KNEW WAS THAT IT CAUSED
PSYCHIATRIC DISTURBANCES

7
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:24,767
AND SEVERE
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.

8
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:28,200
>> EVEN SO, IT SEEMS
THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,634
THIS DISEASE HAS BECOME
NO LESS DEBILITATING,

10
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:33,133
ESPECIALLY HERE
IN THE TRI-STATE SUBURBAN AREA.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,100
>> I ASSURE YOU
THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,000
IS VERY CLOSE TO DEVELOPING
A TREATMENT FOR LYME DISEASE

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,400
BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW THE SOURCE.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,567
>> THE TICK, RIGHT?

15
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:42,701
>> WELL, TECHNICALLY,
THE INFECTION STEMS

16
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,033
FROM THE BLOOD OF THE DEER.

17
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,100
THE TICK IS JUST
THE TRANSMITTER.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,801
>> WELL, IN ANY CASE,
WHAT PRECAUTIONS

19
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:49,667
SHOULD PEOPLE BE TAKING?

20
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:52,200
>> [sighs]

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,267

OR GIVE ME DEATH.

>> HEY, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

24
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,601
THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS FOR HIM TO GET SICK.

25
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,767
HE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE NEXT DOOR

26
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,300
IN ALL THOSE WEEDS
WITHOUT THE TAPE.

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,701
>> YOU NEED A HAIRCUT.

28
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,734
>> OH, SORRY, MICK,
ALL GONE.

29
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,033
>> TICKS, I CAN HANDLE.

30
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,934

THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

IN YOUR HAIR *

>> HEY, DON'T GO FAR.

36
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,367
YOU'RE PARANOID.

37
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,501
>> I'M SORRY, MICK.

38
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,133
I JUST--YOU KNOW,
I HAVE THIS BAD FEELING

39
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,367
IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH.

40
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,868
>> IT'S A TRADITION.

BESIDES, YOU KNOW
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

42
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,501
TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME
WITH HIM LATELY.

43
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,234
>> YEAH, WELL,
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

>> [whispering]
WE DON'T ACTUALLY KILL ANYTHING.

LIKE YOU ASKED ME TO.

46
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,501
>> LISTEN, MICK,
IT'S JUST DANGEROUS NOW, OKAY?

47
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,801
LOOK AT CHARLIE.

48
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,234
>> CHARLIE?
[scoffs]

49
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,801
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF WE FOUND OUT

50
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,000
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS PSYCHOSOMATIC.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
OKAY, LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,834
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE THE ONE
THAT LETS HIM DOWN.

STILL WITH
THAT STUPID QUARTER TRICK?

A FLEXIBLE ENOUGH JOB

00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,467
DOES IT HURT?

355
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:15,367
>> OH!

356
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,934
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

359
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,934
>> FUCKING ASSHOLE.

360
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:34,133
SO LUCKY YOU GOT JIMMY TODAY,

361
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,968
'CAUSE IF THAT SHIT WAS ME...

362
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,434
CALL ME FARTLETT?
YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

363
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,367
CALL ME FARTLETT. WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

364
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,033
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY.

365
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,701
YOU HIT A GUY LIKE THIS,

366
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,901
BOOM, DEAD.

367
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,501
WAH-WAH-WAH.

368
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,267
BAH.

369
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,367
MOLLY MOLLOY,

370
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,334

372
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:05,133

00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,667
NO DOG.

376
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,267
>> SCOTTY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

377
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,701
COME DOWN

378
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:29,100
>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

379
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,133
>> OH, MY GOD.

380
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,901
>> I'LL BET I MAKE THE COVER
OF <i>ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.</i>

381
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:40,033
>> AND IT'S YOURS?

382
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,834
>> NO, I BOUGHT IT
FOR THE RAG HEADS UP THE BLOCK

383
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,968
THAT JUST HIT THE LOTTO.

384
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,901
YES, IT'S MINE.
IT'S OURS.

385
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,701
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

386
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,834
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE LAUNDRY ROOM RIGHT HERE.

387
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,267
THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

388
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:53,434
I PUT IN ONE OF THOSE CENTER
ISLANDS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

389
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,968
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

390
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,300
SCOTT, THIS IS GONNA BE
YOUR ROOM.

391
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,601
>> WOW, LOOKS LIKE
THE <i>MILLENNIUM FALCON.</i>

392
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,934
>> YEAH, MICK, IT'S, UH--
IT'S VERY MODERN.

393
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,834
>> YEAH, IT'S MODERN.
IT'S ULTRAMODERN.

394
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,400
I USED THE BEST ARCHITECT
ON THE ISLAND.

395
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,501
>> REALLY?

396
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,033
IS THERE STILL TIME TO--
I DON'T KNOW--

397
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,634
MAYBE, UH, TAKE THE EDGE OFF
SOMEHOW?

398
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,534
>> TAKE THE EDGE OFF?
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

399
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:11,801
>> NO.

400
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:14,000
>> YOU MEANT <i>MILLENNIUM FALCON</i>
IN A GOOD WAY?

401
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,901
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

402
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,167
>> CHECK THIS OUT.

403
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,601
THIS IS WHERE THE SUNROOM
IS GONNA BE

404
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:22,901
WITH THE EASTERN EXPOSURE.

405
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:25,167
GET THAT MORNING LIGHT
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT--BEAUTIFUL.

406
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:28,300
THE WINDOWS ARE DOUBLE-PANED,
PLATE GLASS, SLIGHTLY TINTED.

407
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,200
THEY COST A FORTUNE,
BUT THEY ARE--

408
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,601
smooch--
BEAUTIFUL.

409
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,367
>> YEAH, BUT WOULDN'T IT
JUST BE CHEAPER

410
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,634
IF WE BUILT A SUNROOM
ON OUR HOUSE?

411
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:37,634
>> WE DON'T HAVE THE ACREAGE
ON OUR PROPERTY.

412
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,167
WE COULD BUILD
A TENNIS COURT HERE.

413
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,400
>> WE DON'T HAVE ANY
TENNIS PLAYERS IN OUR FAMILY.

414
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
[train horn blows]

415
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,968
>> MAYBE YOU COULD LEARN.

416
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:45,367
>> WE COULD PUT
A TENNIS COURT IN NOW

417
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,801
IF I WANTED TO LEARN, MICKEY.

418
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,968
>> WELL, YEAH, WE COULD PUT IN
AN ABOVEGROUND POOL TOO.

419
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,467
BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL
BE BACK IN QUEENS.

420
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:52,167
>> IT WOULDN'T BE
SUCH A BAD THING, WOULD IT?

421
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,601
>> TO BE BACK IN QUEENS?
>> YEAH.

422
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,534
>> COME ON, MOM. DON'T ARGUE.
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

423
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,634
>> WE'LL BE INSIDE.

424
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,234
>> [sighs]

425
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,267
YOU COULD HAVE
AT LEAST WARNED ME.

426
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,767
I MEAN, A DECISION LIKE THIS
YOU MAKE WITHOUT ASKING ME,

427
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:04,934
MOVING OUR FAMILY?

428
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,334
>> IT'S NEXT DOOR.

429
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:09,300
WE'RE NOT MOVING.
WE'RE UPGRADING, YOU KNOW?

430
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,734
IN WITH THE NEW.

431
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,968
OUT WITH THE OLD.

432
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,467
[whispering] FUCKER.

433
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,901
>> WHAT IS IT WITH QUEENS?

434
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,501
SHE'S LIKE DOROTHY
IN <i>THE WIZARD OF OZ.</i>

435
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:27,634
>> IT'S DIFFERENT THERE.

436
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,467
SHE HAD HER NEIGHBORS AROUND
TO COMPLAIN TO.

437
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,901
TAKES HER MIND OFF THE PROBLEMS.

438
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,968
>> WHAT PROBLEMS?

439
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,033
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS.

440
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,234
>> YOU SOUND LIKE DAD.

441
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:37,167
>> I DO?

442
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,367
THEY DON'T EVEN FUCK ANYMORE.

443
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,601
>> WHAT? HOW THE FUCK
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

444
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,133
>> YOU KNOW THE RUBBERS
UNDER DAD'S BED

445
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,434
WE USED TO USE
AS WATER BALLOONS?

446
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:48,801
>> EW, YEAH.

447
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:51,400
>> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THERE
IN OVER A YEAR.

448
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,868
>> OKAY, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

449
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:55,501
THAT'S SICK
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT,

450
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,067
AND SECOND, SHE'S COMING,
SO SHUT THE FUCK UP.

451
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,767
[chuckles quietly]

454
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,267
>> FOUND THEM
IN MY WINDOW WELL.

455
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:27,100
>> WHAT IF THEY HAVE PARENTS
WHO WILL BE WORRIED

456
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
IF THEY DON'T COME HOME?

457
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,834
>> YEAH, IF FROGS WORRY,
I GUESS.

458
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,033
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD
HAPPEN IF I DIDN'T COME HOME?

459
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,100
>> THEY'D LOOK FOR YOU.

460
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,534
>> WHO?

461
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,467
>> I DON'T KNOW.

462
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,667
MAYBE THEY'D SEND
BLAZE SALAD FUCK.

463
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,400
[chuckles]
I'M KIDDING.

464
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,767
REALLY, I'M--YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY
HE NEVER ASKED YOU OUT.

465
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,801
>> IT WAS WEIRD
SEEING YOU GET YOUR ASS KICKED.

466
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:54,133
>> WELL, HE'S BIGGER THAN ME.

467
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,067
WASN'T A FAIR FIGHT.

468
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,501
>> YEAH, BUT--I DON'T KNOW--

469
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:58,901
I FELT LIKE YOU WERE,
LIKE, MY, UH--

470
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,300
MY LITTLE BROTHER OR SOMETHING.

471

I'M--I'M KIDDING.
I WAS JOKING.

477
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:15,167
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T MEAN IT
IN A BAD WAY.

478
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,234
NO, I WAS--
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

479

>> I'M NOT MAD.
>> GOD, YOU'RE BEING SUCH A...

480
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,367
>> NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SMOTHER IT WITH SOMETHING.

481
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,367
THEN YOU CAN PULL IT OUT.

482
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:37,501

>> WHAT DOES THIS FEEL--
THIS FEELS LIKE

537
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
JUST A PERPETUAL ACID TRIP

AS MORE THAN JUST, LIKE,
A BROTHER?

AND YOU KNOW HOW CHARLIE IS
ABOUT FAVORS,

00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:44,868
BUT I JUST CAN'T LIVE
WITH IT.

802
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:46,267
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

803
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:47,868
I JUST WISH YOU'D SAID
SOMETHING SOONER.

I MEAN, WELL,

807
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,067
YOU COULD TAKE IT
OUT OF MY COMMISSIONS.

808
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:57,267
>> OH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
PLEASE.

809
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,334
YOU DESERVE IT.

810
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:01,000
JUST TELL CHARLIE
IT'S A BONUS.

811
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,200
I CAN GIVE YOU A BONUS, RIGHT?

YOU HAVE TO INHALE
LIKE, UH--

823

WATCH, LIKE THIS.

825
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,467

I MEAN, I KNOW.

833
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:09,701
>> IF YOU WERE, LIKE,
THREE YEARS OLDER,

834
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:10,901
WE COULD GO OUT.

835
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:12,334
'CAUSE I ONLY GO OUT
WITH OLDER BOYS.

MY DAD DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ONE.

HE'S THE ONE I TAKE AFTER.

843
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:31,567

TO ATTRACT THE LADIES.

>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

845

00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,834
I MEAN, THE BOTH OF THEM

852
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:54,534
ARE JUST SO--I DON'T KNOW--
PHONY OR SOMETHING.

853
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:55,734
>> PHONY?

854
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,501
HAVE YOU BEEN READING THAT BOOK
ABOUT THE KID

855
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:59,834
WHO RUNS AWAY

>> ARE YOU FEELING IT?
>> YOU MAKE ME...

862
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,901
>> [laughs]

863
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:20,133
>> TURNS OUT THAT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S PHON--WHO'S PHONY

864
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,934
IS, YOU KNOW,
FUCKING WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.

865
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,934
UH, THE--THE--

>> ANYWAYS, AS I WAS SAYING,
OLDER BOYS...

872
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:42,834
THEY CAN TAKE A HINT.

873
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,634
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T HAVE
TO DO MUCH GUESSING.

874
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:47,734
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A GIRL'S
WEARING MISTLETOE IN HER HAIR,

875
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:51,234
PRETTY MUCH MEANS ONE THING.

876
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:53,300
>> OH, WOW, YEAH.

SHE'S A BIG, FAT, SLUTTY WHORE.

1228
00:55:44,934 --> 00:55:47,100
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT HER.

1229
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:52,200
>> MAYBE THEY'LL, LIKE,
DIE TOGETHER

1230
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,300
IN A CAR ACCIDENT
OR SOMETHING.

1231
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:58,834
[electricity buzzing]

1232
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:00,767
>> YOU KNOW
THIS IS THE THIRD RAIL, RIGHT?

1233
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,200
>> REALLY?

1234
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,801
IS THAT ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

1235
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:10,667
>> YOU KNOW, THEY SAY NO MATTER
WHERE YOU ARE ON LONG ISLAND,

1236
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,801
YOU CAN ALWAYS HEAR THE TRAIN.

1237
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:15,868
CAN'T GET FAR ENOUGH AWAY.

1238
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:21,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU,
WALT WHITMAN NOW?

1239
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:28,767
AND DON'T FOLLOW ME.

1240
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:40,067
>> YOUR FATHER CALLED.

1241
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,267
>> YEAH?

1242
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,567
>> YEAH, HE, UH--
HE SAID HE GOT TICKETS

1243
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,067
TO THE GAME TONIGHT
AT THE COLISEUM.

1244
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:50,767
HE WANTS YOU TO BE READY
TO LEAVE BY 6:00.

1245
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:53,234
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO.

1246
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,267
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO TO THE GAME?

1247
00:57:10,267 --> 00:57:12,133
HE LOVES THE ISLANDERS.

1248
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,534
WHERE IS HE?
IS HE IN HIS ROOM?

1249
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:17,100
IS HE SICK?

1250
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,434
>> HE KNOWS.

1251
00:57:20,434 --> 00:57:23,701
>> HE KNOWS WHAT?

1252
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:27,067
>> HE KNOWS THAT YOU'RE
A MOTHERFUCKER, LITERALLY.

1253
00:57:27,067 --> 00:57:31,467
>> WHAT KIND OF SHIT
IS THAT TO SAY?

1254
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:35,434
>> YOU DO FUCK MOTHERS,
DON'T YOU?

1255
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:39,300
>> MAN, YOU CAN TAKE THE GIRL
OUT OF QUEENS, AM I RIGHT?

1256
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,400
>> YEAH, AND WHAT ARE YOU,
KING FAROUK ALL OF A SUDDEN

1257
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,234
NOW YOU GOT A FEW DOLLARS
IN YOUR POCKET?

1258
00:57:44,234 --> 00:57:46,868
[exhales heavily]

1259
00:57:46,868 --> 00:57:48,501
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE, MICK.

1260
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:51,701
>> YOU CAN'T DO WHAT?

1261
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:54,200
>> I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE.

1262
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,767
I CANNOT STAND
THE SIGHT OF YOUR FACE.

1263
00:57:57,767 --> 00:58:00,000
I DO NOT WANT TO BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU.

1264
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,267
I-I FIND YOU SO UGLY.

1265
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:05,167
AND I CAN'T EVEN STAND
THE WAY YOU FUCKING SMELL,

1266
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:06,300
THE WAY YOU BRUSH YOUR TEETH,

1267
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,968
THE WAY YOU EAT
YOUR FUCKING FOOD.

1268
00:58:07,968 --> 00:58:10,701
OH, YOU GOT THE FUCKING
SHIT-EATING GRIN ON YOUR FACE

1269
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:11,834
ALL THE TIME.

1270
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:13,634
YOU FUCKING DRIVE ME
UP THE FUCKING WALL.

1271
00:58:13,634 --> 00:58:15,234
AND I CAN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF

1272
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:17,167
IF I HAVE TO SPEND
ANOTHER NIGHT IN BED WITH YOU.

1273
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:20,000
YOU MAKE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH.

1274
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,434
>> HEY, FUCK THIS GARBAGE!

1275
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:23,501
I'M GONNA GO GET SCOTT,
AND I'M TAKING HIM TO THE GAME.

1276
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,167
[plate shatters]
>> GOD DAMN IT, MICKEY.

1277
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,667
I WILL NOT BE HUMILIATED
IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN ANYMORE.

1278
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:28,734
>> HUMILIATED?

1279
00:58:28,734 --> 00:58:30,033
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1280
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:31,067
I BREAK MY ASS
FOR THIS FAMILY!

1281
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:32,434
>> OH, BULLSHIT.

1282
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:34,567
>> AND YOU SPEND MORE TIME
WITH YOUR GODDAMN FIG TREE--

1283
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:35,868
>> MY MOTHER GOT ME
THAT FIG TREE.

1284
00:58:35,868 --> 00:58:37,133
SHE TOLD ME NOT TO MARRY IRISH.

1285
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:38,400
>> PLEASE.
>> JESUS CHRIST.

1286
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,334
AND IF YOU WANT TO BRING
OUR WEDDING DAY INTO THIS,

1287
00:58:40,334 --> 00:58:41,868
THAT'S AN EVEN BIGGER ISSUE.

1288
00:58:41,868 --> 00:58:42,934
>> FUCK THIS NONSENSE!

1289
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,033
I'M GONNA GO GET SCOTT.

1290
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:45,234
I'M GOING TO THE GAME.

1291
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:47,067
>> CHRIST, LOOK,
I MADE MY DECISION.

1292
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,133
>> WHAT, YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW
THAT YOU WEREN'T HAPPY

1293
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:50,200
ON YOUR WEDDING DAY?

1294
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,601
>> TELLING ME
THAT YOU FELT TRAPPED

1295
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:52,968
MINUTES BEFORE THE CEREMONY

1296
00:58:52,968 --> 00:58:55,334
DIDN'T EXACTLY BRING
A FUCKING SMILE TO MY FACE.

1297
00:58:55,334 --> 00:58:57,634
>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TUX.

1298
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,601
>> SO THIS IS ALL JUST
SOME BIG MISUNDERSTANDING?

1299
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:00,934
>> MAYBE, MAYBE.
>> OH, OKAY.

1300
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:02,801
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE?
WELL, NO MORE.

1301
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:03,901
I MADE MY DECISION.

1302
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:06,133
I WANT YOU OUT
OF THIS FUCKING HOUSE.

1303
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,868
>> DO YOU KNOW
WHY I GO WITH OTHER WOMEN?

1304
00:59:09,868 --> 00:59:11,100
>> OH, CHRIST.

1305
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,767
>> DO YOU KNOW WHY I GO
WITH OTHER WOMEN?

1306
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,033
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TELL ME

1307
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:15,801
THAT I MAKE THEM SICK
TO THEIR STOMACH!

1308
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:18,734
>> I DON'T CARE.
>> THAT'S WHY I DO THAT.

1309
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:19,968
>> SHUT THE FUCK UP.
>> FUCK YOU.

1310
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:21,200

00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,934
YOU GET THE FUCK
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,567
>> OH, COME ON, PLEASE.

1314
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,334
AND GO WHERE?
WHERE DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA GO?

1315
00:59:28,334 --> 00:59:29,334
I'M NOT GONNA GET--

1316

00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:38,234
I AM CRAZY.
I'M FUCKING INSANE RIGHT NOW.

I TELL MYSELF THAT EVERY DAY.

1340
01:00:42,767 --> 01:00:45,467
SHE'S A REAL GEM, A PRO.

1341
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:48,901
WELL, SIT DOWN.

THE DOCTOR TELLS ME
IT'S MS, RIGHT?

WHAT AMAZES ME, MICK,
IS THAT THIS TINY LITTLE BUG

1368
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,868

AND SHE TELLS ME,

1398
01:03:43,267 --> 01:03:44,934
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOT
TO TALK TO ME RIGHT NOW,

1399
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:46,300
ALL THIS SERIOUS DRAMATIC SHIT.

1400
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,434
SHE ACCUSES ME
OF IMAGINING ALL THIS.

1401
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:50,601
WHAT WAS THE WORD SHE USED?

1402
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:52,267
UH, "PSYCHOSOMATIC,"

1403
01:03:52,267 --> 01:03:53,934
YOU KNOW, WE BRING THINGS ON
OURSELVES.

1404
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:56,167
SO SHE'S A FUCKING PHILOSOPHER
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

1405
01:03:56,167 --> 01:04:01,234
NOW, I'M THINKING,
WHERE DID SHE PICK THAT UP?

1406
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:03,734
>> [laughs]

1407
01:04:03,734 --> 01:04:07,467
I HAVE NO IDEA, CHARLIE,
BUT I'M REAL SORRY ABOUT IT.

1408
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:11,400
>> WELL, COME ON, NOW, MICK.
YOU SEE HER EVERY DAY.

1409
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,234
I'M WONDERING IF SOMEONE'S BEEN
WHISPERING IN HER EAR

1410
01:04:14,234 --> 01:04:16,834
LIKE A LITTLE SHIT BIRD.

1411
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:21,801
>> CHARLIE, I GOT MY OWN
FUCKING PROBLEMS, OKAY?

1412
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:28,634
>> HEY, MICK.

1413
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,968
[imitates whispering]

1414
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,200
[plucked string music]

1415
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:49,167
* *

1416
01:05:09,267 --> 01:05:10,467
>> FARTLETT.

1417
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:12,567
>> WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU JUST SAY?

1418
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:15,501
>> WHAT? I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

1419
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:18,033
YOU ARE SO FUCKING LUCKY
YOU GOT YOUR BROTHER.

1420
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:19,100
>> HEY, FUCK YOU.

1421
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,701
>> YOU FUCK--OH, SHIT.

1422
01:05:20,701 --> 01:05:22,567
OH, OH.

1423
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:23,567
OH.

1424
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:24,567
YOU FUCK--OH!

1425
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:25,801
GET OFF ME!

1426
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:28,100
GET OFF ME!

1427
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,234
AAAH!

1428
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:31,300
OW! GET OFF ME!

1429
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,701
GET OFF ME.

1430
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:34,934
OH.

1431
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:35,934
AH!

1432
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:37,367
AH!

1433
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:40,100
AAAH!

1434
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:46,868
[thunder booming]

1435
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:51,334
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

1436
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:53,067
>> GET OUT OF THE CAR
RIGHT NOW.

1437
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:54,968
YES, YOU'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE
TO THIS BOY.

1438
01:05:54,968 --> 01:05:56,300
>> FOR WHAT?

1439
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,601
>> THIS BOY DOES NOT HAVE
THE LUXURIES YOU DO.

1440
01:05:58,601 --> 01:05:59,934
HE'S LESS FORTUNATE
THAN YOU ARE.

1441
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:01,467
>> YEAH, HE'S STILL
A FUCKING ASSHOLE.

1442
01:06:01,467 --> 01:06:02,467
>> SCOTTY, GOD DAMN IT.

1443
01:06:02,467 --> 01:06:03,667
>> OW.

1444
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:05,534
WHEN JIMMY CAME HERE,
HE ALMOST KILLED HIM.

1445
01:06:05,534 --> 01:06:06,634
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

1446
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,100
>> WHAT, JIMMY BEAT
THIS BOY TOO?

1447
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,367
>> YES, A LONG TIME AGO.

1448
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:11,567
AND I HEARD YOU SAY "FUCK"
1,000 TIMES LAST NIGHT.

1449
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,634
>> WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
>> "FUCK, FUCK, MOTHERFUCKER."

1450
01:06:13,634 --> 01:06:15,300
>> SCOTTY, STOP IT.
>> YOU KNOW, FUCK THIS.

1451
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,667
OH, YEAH,
I'M SURE YOU GIVE A SHIT.

1452
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:20,434
FUCK YOU. FUCK DAD.
YOU GUYS FUCKING SUCK, MAN.

1453
01:06:23,067 --> 01:06:26,501
[train rumbling, horn blowing]

1454
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:30,701
>> I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO DROP BY AND SEE THE PLACE.

1455
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:32,501
>> WHEN I PICKED HIM UP
FROM SCHOOL TODAY,

1456
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:37,567
HIS PRINCIPAL INFORMED ME THAT
HE'S BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A WEEK.

1457
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:39,734
>> THIS O'LEARY
GONNA PRESS CHARGES?

1458
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:42,601
>> NO, NO, THEY'RE NOT, UH--

1459
01:06:42,601 --> 01:06:45,467
MICKEY, THEY'RE NOT
GOOD PARENTS.

1460
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:46,868
>> WELL, PUNISH HIM.
YOU KNOW HOW.

1461
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:48,033
>> BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

1462
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:49,200
>> LOOK, WE ALL NEED
TO LEARN

1463
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,667
HOW TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR OUR ACTIONS.

1464
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:53,834
WE SHOULD AT LEAST PAY
FOR THIS BOY'S MEDICAL EXPENSES.

1465
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:55,267
>> FINE.
>> HE DID HIT ME FIRST.

1466
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:56,434
>> NO, THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.

1467
01:06:56,434 --> 01:06:58,701
>> AND HE CALLED YOU
A NIGGER-RICH SAVAGE.

1468
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,367
>> FUCK HIM
AND HIS MEDICAL BILLS.

1469
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:03,834
>> THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.

1470
01:07:03,834 --> 01:07:05,067
AND, WHAT, YOU'VE BEEN WAITING

1471
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:06,467
FOR THE RIGHT TIME
TO POUNCE HIM?

1472
01:07:06,467 --> 01:07:08,067
>> [quietly] NO.

1473
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:11,267
TODAY HE CALLED ME FARTLETT.

1474
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:13,601
>> HE CALLED YOU WHAT?

1475
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:16,634
>> FARTLETT.

1476
01:07:16,634 --> 01:07:21,200
>> SCOTT, SCOTT,
YOU DON'T THINK.

1477
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,734
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
WHEN I BUILT THE SITE

1478
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:23,834
ABOUT PEOPLE BEING JEALOUS?

1479
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:25,200
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

1480
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
>> I DON'T HAVE TO FUCKING
LISTEN TO YOU ANYMORE.

1481
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,667
FUCK YOU.

1482
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:32,334
[door clicks open and shut]

1483
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:33,467
>> MICK.

1484
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,200
>> WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT?

1485
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,801
YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO PUNISH HIM.

1486
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:39,701
>> NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

1487
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:41,334
>> WHAT IS IT ABOUT, THEN?

1488
01:07:41,334 --> 01:07:43,767
SOME TWISTED WAY FOR YOU
TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD?

1489
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:45,067
>> NO.

1490
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:46,767
LOOK, DIVORCED
AND SEPARATED PARENTS

1491
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:48,801
LET THEIR KIDS
GET AWAY WITH MURDER

1492
01:07:48,801 --> 01:07:51,367
BECAUSE THEY FEEL GUILTY
THAT THEY BROKE UP THE HOME.

1493
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,868
BUT IT'S A TRAP

1494
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,567
'CAUSE THE KIDS WIND UP
FEELING RESENTFUL,

1495
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:57,667
AND EVEN WORSE, ON DRUGS,
GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE.

1496
01:07:57,667 --> 01:07:59,367
>> [laughs]

1497
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:03,167
I MEAN, I'M OUT OF THE FUCKING
HOUSE 18 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES,

1498
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:05,100
AND YOU'RE
DR. FUCKING RUTH NOW?

1499
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,767
>> SHE'S A SEX THERAPIST, MICK.

1500
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:08,234
AND I SAW IT ON <i>DONAHUE.</i>

1501
01:08:08,234 --> 01:08:09,534
IT IS TRUE.

1502
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:11,567
>> HE'S MAD BECAUSE
YOU THREW HIS FATHER OUT.

1503
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:12,834
IT'S NORMAL.

1504
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:15,000
>> IS IT NORMAL THAT NOW HE SAYS
HE HATES HIS FATHER?

1505
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,200
IS THAT NORMAL TOO?

1506
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,167
>> THEN YOU ACCOMPLISHED
WHAT YOU SET OUT TO DO.

1507
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:19,334
>> AND WHAT'S THAT?

1508
01:08:19,334 --> 01:08:21,834
>> TO PIN THE WHOLE THING
ON ME.

1509
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,634
>> OH.

1510
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,133
WOW.

1511
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:30,100
I CAME HERE FOR HIM,

1512
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,801
AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING IT
ALL ABOUT YOU.

1513
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:35,300
WOW.

1514
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:52,067
>> SHE STILL AWAKE?

1515
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:56,300
THAT'S GOOD.

1516
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,200
THROW ME DOWN ONE.

1517
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,133
>> ONE WHAT?

1518
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:01,667
>> THE SMOKE,

1519
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:04,434
I COULD SEE IT
FROM MY WINDOW.

1520
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:12,400
>> SINCE WHEN DO YOU SMOKE?

1521
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,901
>> DON'T BE A TIGHT-ASS.
THROW ME ONE.

1522
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:22,300
THIS THING ISN'T GONNA LIGHT
ITSELF, YOU KNOW.

1523
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,133
[snaps]

1524
01:09:29,968 --> 01:09:32,601
THESE ALWAYS REMIND ME
OF MY DAD...

1525
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:39,000
WHEN HE WAS DYING OF CANCER.

1526
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,634
I WAS YOUR AGE.

1527
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:46,367
HIS DAD DIED FROM IT TOO.

1528
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,234
HE WAS SO HELL-BENT
THAT HE WAS GONNA GET IT,

1529
01:09:48,234 --> 01:09:49,634
HIS NERVES WERE SHOT.

1530
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:55,000
THE FUCKING DOCTORS
ACTUALLY TOLD HIM TO SMOKE.

1531
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,567
LYING IN THAT BED, 80 POUNDS,

1532
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:02,133
STINKING UP THE WHOLE ROOM.

1533
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,367
AH, WHAT DID THEY KNOW
BACK THEN, RIGHT?

1534
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:11,300
HEY, COME ON DOWN.
WE'LL GO TO CARVEL.

1535
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,400
WE'LL GO GET A SHAKE.

1536
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,868
>> NO, I'M TIRED.

1537
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:16,133
I HAVE SCHOOL TOMORROW.

1538
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:18,000
>> YOU'RE SUSPENDED.

1539
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,334
>> STILL, MOM WILL GET MAD
IF I GO THIS LATE.

1540
01:10:21,334 --> 01:10:22,434
>> IT'S NOT EVEN 11:00.

1541
01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:24,968
COME ON DOWN.
SHE'LL NEVER KNOW.

1542
01:10:24,968 --> 01:10:28,334
>> THEN I'LL BE A LIAR TOO.

1543
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:32,000
[train wheels clicking]

1544
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,234
>> I NEVER LIED TO HER, SCOTT.

1545
01:10:35,234 --> 01:10:38,400
SHE JUST NEVER BOTHERED
TO ASK.

1546
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:44,634
IT ISN'T SOME STATE SECRET THAT
WE HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ALONG

1547
01:10:44,634 --> 01:10:47,434
AND FOR A LONG TIME TOO.

1548
01:10:47,434 --> 01:10:49,634
PEOPLE DO STUPID THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING

1549
01:10:49,634 --> 01:10:53,567
TO GET SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T FIT TO FIT.

1550
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:56,501
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

1551
01:10:56,501 --> 01:10:58,400
BUT I'VE ALREADY LOST ONE KID

1552
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,100
BECAUSE OF MY PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

1553
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,267
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE OTHER.

1554
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:08,167
>> WELL--WELL, THEN WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO FUCK HER, DAD?

1555
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,334
>> IT'S TOUGH
TO BE A MAN, SCOTT.

1556
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:18,100
YOU GOT TO MAKE MONEY
TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE.

1557
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,567
YOU GOT TO BE A DAD
TO YOUR KIDS.

1558
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,133
YOU GOT TO BE A HUSBAND
TO YOUR WIFE.

1559
01:11:21,133 --> 01:11:22,200
THE MONEY PART I GOT.

1560
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,834
THE DAD PART, I'M BATTING .500.

1561
01:11:23,834 --> 01:11:27,300
THE HUSBAND PART...

1562
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,367
THEN OTHER PEOPLE
COME INTO THE PICTURE

1563
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:35,000
AT THE RIGHT OR THE WRONG TIME,
AND THINGS HAPPEN.

1564
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,067
I WAS UNHAPPY.

1565
01:11:39,067 --> 01:11:42,734
I AM UNHAPPY.

1566
01:11:42,734 --> 01:11:45,968
BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OKAY.

1567
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,100
