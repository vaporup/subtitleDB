1
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,858
Dinner is at 6.
Good job, guys!

2
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,178
BONG?

3
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:30,611
Mi-jin.

4
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:34,050
I got little something
for you.

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,449
You shouldn't have...

6
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,985
You've come a long way.

7
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:45,227
I guess our practice
at Karaoke paid off.

8
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:48,390
I was so embarrassed then.

9
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,564
Quite an experience
for me though.

10
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,869
BONG...

11
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:55,268
Please.

12
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,202
You're warm.

13
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:12,620
Mi-jin, I love you.

14
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:16,450
BONG...

15
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:22,326
The movie isn't done yet.

16
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,527
It needs editing.

17
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:43,909
Mi-jin...

18
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,760
How do you feel about
your new life?

19
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,566
It's so refreshing.

20
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:09,134
Let's have a party
of our own.

21
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,933
Sure. Why not?

22
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,639
Why'd you choose me?

23
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:25,381
You were so helpless
like myself long ago.

24
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,050
When were you chosen?

25
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,358
100 years ago.

26
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,694
I couldn't be more
confident now.

27
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,999
Who will do the editing?

28
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,739
An assistant director.
He's good.

29
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:51,907
Here, cheers.

30
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:53,542
Cheers.

31
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:05,260
Didn't it hurt?
I was in so much pain the first time.

32
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:09,092
Not really.
I was drunk.

33
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
Your blood was so fresh.

34
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:19,132
BONG's blood was
a bit salty.

35
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,542
You'll get used to it.

36
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:30,350
How old are you?

37
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:36,418
120. Age is just a number.

38
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,590
It's delicious.

39
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:45,331
That part is good
for your skin.

40
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:49,598
What if I get hooked
and crave it?

41
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:54,698
Control yourself. But you must
eat it once every 2 years.

42
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:58,913
Cause there are many men
who need to go.

43
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,249
Jane... Jane...

44
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,660
Don't talk.

45
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:30,162
In the End is My Beginning

46
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:01,695
Remember me?

47
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,965
My daughter tutored you
in high school.

48
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:08,004
I even cooked for you.

49
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,446
How dare you show up here!

50
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:11,743
Stop it.

51
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,382
You're nothing but a whore.

52
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,609
Get out of here!

53
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,717
Honey?

54
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,360
Get up.
Breakfast is ready.

55
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,503
Let me sleep some more.

56
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:09,838
Come on.
Let's eat together.

57
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:12,274
You know we can't.

58
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,866
Why not?

59
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,310
I'm dead. Remember?

60
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:07,750
It's a plant.

61
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:11,525
"Water it and
what you need will grow."

62
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,192
What are you doing here?

63
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,662
How'd you get in?

64
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:33,172
I've been here for a while.

65
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,811
Get out of here.
Now!

66
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:42,482
No point kicking me out.
Cause I'll be back.

67
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,480
What's going on here?

68
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:51,018
Did you call her?

69
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,498
Get out.

70
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,200
- No.
- Now.

71
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,967
Please.

72
00:11:58,967 --> 00:11:59,901
Get out.

73
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,971
Let me stay here.
I'll do anything.

74
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,239
Shut up and leave.

75
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,741
I'm begging you.
Let me stay.

76
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,742
- Please...
- Get out!

77
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,266
Let me stay.

78
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,994
Let me stay...

79
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,557
Please.

80
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:30,994
Why don't you?

81
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,328
No way.

82
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:33,969
Give her a break.

83
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:34,903
I said no!

84
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:37,030
Let me stay.

85
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,097
Please.

86
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:41,842
Let her or I'll leave.

87
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,711
Hi.

88
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:44,590
You can't get over him?

89
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,237
Searching for his memories...

90
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:51,840
It's not that.

91
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,364
Save it.

92
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:57,237
That's what you're here for,
isn't it?

93
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,212
I won't touch his things
if it bothers you.

94
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,073
You sure?

95
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,788
Change into that.

96
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,890
It'll bring back
vivid memories of him.

97
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,704
You're killing me.

98
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:37,845
Make it tighter.

99
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,117
Am I pretty?

100
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,568
You're still so pretty.

101
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:04,713
What'd you do
after high school?

102
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,477
A lot of things.

103
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,418
I delivered. I cleaned.

104
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:14,715
I gave manicures.

105
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:20,326
Then I acted in a few plays.

106
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,196
I did magic, too.

107
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:32,732
You know what you're best at.

108
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:35,234
Like what?

109
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:38,536
Recognize this?

110
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:41,807
You could've been a porn star.

111
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,450
You were a slut
back in school days.

112
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,384
I wasn't.
You know that.

113
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,523
I thought I did.

114
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:04,899
Eat it.

115
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:12,579
Eat it all.

116
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:17,315
So you can cherish
such a precious memory.

117
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,546
It's some sight to see.

118
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,672
Are you OK?

119
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,607
I'm fine.

120
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,936
Come in.

121
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,408
Hi.

122
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:58,286
She's just a maid.
Don't mind her.

123
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,583
Draw the tub for us.

124
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:00,919
Let's go.

125
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:02,484
Let's go!

126
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,962
Stop it.

127
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:20,333
Hey! Come up here.

128
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:22,773
What this is for?

129
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:24,236
You... favor?

130
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:32,585
Tie me.

131
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,252
You are for real?

132
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,358
Tie me up.

133
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:48,927
What are you doing?

134
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,436
Tie me like he tied you.

135
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,541
Tighter.

136
00:19:56,744 --> 00:20:00,510
Come on. Tighter.

137
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,317
Oh, come on.
Are you sure you want...

138
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,986
Tighter! Tighter!
Come on!

139
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,352
You can do better!

140
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,085
Tie me tighter.

141
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:14,162
Make it tighter.

142
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,060
Tighter.

143
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:17,232
- I'm get going...
- Where are you going?

144
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:20,360
Get back here!

145
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:52,299
It's no fun.

146
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:56,700
Oh God...

147
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,329
What's wrong with me?

148
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:39,905
What's that?

149
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:52,280
In case I couldn't stand
this punishment.

150
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,697
Jung-ha...

151
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,670
It feels weird.

152
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:51,106
What?

153
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:57,544
A wife and a lover celebrating
his birthday together.

154
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,848
What a lucky bastard.

155
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,827
Leave now.

156
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,430
What?

157
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,829
Leave.

158
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,833
Stop saying that.

159
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,398
I'd rather kill myself.

160
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,343
I mean it.

161
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:32,081
It started raining that day
unexpectedly.

162
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:36,586
All my dad did was magic.

163
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,256
So I didn't expect him
to pick me up.

164
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:46,128
You stole me an umbrella
from a store.

165
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,430
Right then, a raindrop...

166
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:54,840
It fell on your forehead
like a God's voice.

167
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:59,469
And it exploded
over your eyebrows.

168
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,506
So did my heart.

169
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,715
If I could get near you...

170
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,890
...I would've done worse

171
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,188
- than seducing him.
- That's enough.

172
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,220
He might hear you.

173
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,031
Don't make him upset
on his birthday.

174
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:20,327
When we first kissed...

175
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,571
Stop it.
I don't remember.

176
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:27,168
My tongue...

177
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:32,544
When it got into your mouth...

178
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:39,351
You told me
you heard a bell ringing.

179
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:45,424
Was it the same
when you kissed Jane?

180
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,952
Yes.

181
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:56,964
You truly loved him.

182
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:42,876
Tie me up.

183
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:43,624
Stop.

184
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,332
I said stop.

185
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:58,644
Am I not better than him?

186
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:04,881
You don't arouse me.

187
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,331
Stop it, will you?

188
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,942
Can't you see?

189
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:08,039
I'm you, Jung-ha.

190
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,037
Awake?

191
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,505
You can leave now.

192
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:14,512
Thanks.

193
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:17,981
I have to ask you.

194
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:19,745
Yes?

195
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:23,049
Did you know?

196
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:27,319
Naru didn't...

197
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,792
I know.

198
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:11,686
Be good.

199
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:13,449
Hi.

200
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,567
Hey!
You're 30 minutes late.

201
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:36,870
Why the hell are you late?

202
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:43,080
God...

203
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:46,544
Did it hurt?

204
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,110
You're buying.

205
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:53,521
Excuse me?

206
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:09,740
You haven't changed.

207
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:14,107
You either.

208
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:21,049
We'll have fun today.

209
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:24,884
Just like we did.

210
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:27,592
Just today?

211
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:55,851
Can't a girl eat?

212
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:01,421
I've never seen a girl
eating like a pig.

213
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:11,298
The beautiful eat a lot.

214
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:15,099
Here, eat some.

215
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:27,151
You won't get it?

216
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:36,662
Wanna see something funny?

217
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:50,137
What about Su-jung?

218
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:53,174
Going together?

219
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,539
We will.
If she decides to.

220
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,119
Is that why
we're doing this?

221
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:11,630
I just wanted to know
how she feels about me.

222
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,201
What about you?

223
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,371
I wanted to make sure, too.

224
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:22,735
Make sure what?

225
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:30,382
What Ji-woon means to me.

226
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:34,588
I know you like him.

227
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:37,148
What about him?

228
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:42,821
He will find out today.

229
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:49,062
I wonder how it will end.

230
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:08,250
You've done that before.

231
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:11,323
I know.
I'll do more today.

232
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,618
What else are you gonna
show me?

233
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,428
Show you?
I don't think so.

234
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:23,099
I'm sleeping with him today.

235
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,874
You suck in bed.

236
00:40:31,411 --> 00:40:32,400
He's way better.

237
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,125
You're crazy.

238
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,924
You think so?

239
00:42:36,703 --> 00:42:42,164
You don't think you are?

240
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:50,314
How long have you been
with an art teacher?

241
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:53,313
Beats me.
I can't remember.

242
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:58,822
I just can't understand you.

243
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:08,633
What?

244
00:43:08,768 --> 00:43:11,100
Can you understand
what we're doing then?

245
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:20,936
Who is it?

246
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,044
It's Yoon-jung.

247
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,354
She's sounding you out.

248
00:43:36,496 --> 00:43:39,397
I don't know.
I don't know.

249
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:43,661
This is pathetic.
Why'd you suggest this?

250
00:43:48,775 --> 00:43:52,178
You're a fool.
If this will break you up,

251
00:43:52,178 --> 00:43:54,738
you're not meant to be together.

252
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:57,343
So naive.

253
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:20,198
What'd he say?

254
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:26,842
"Do as you please."

255
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:33,417
He doesn't mean it.

256
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:38,781
He's just pretending to be cool.

257
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:41,059
Like you?

258
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:47,360
I know how I feel
about Su-jung.

259
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:51,128
What about her?

260
00:45:08,688 --> 00:45:13,785
Tell me.
Is Se-eun ok with this?

261
00:45:21,401 --> 00:45:24,734
How'd you guys hook up?

262
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,060
Sang-min.

263
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:51,390
Do you wanna...

264
00:45:58,071 --> 00:45:59,595
...kiss me?

265
00:46:04,978 --> 00:46:08,539
What are you trying to pull?

266
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:22,886
See you tomorrow at school.

267
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,545
I can't believe he did that.

268
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:48,115
He hasn't called you?

269
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,679
By the way,
where are we going?

270
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,608
We have a thing to do.

271
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:19,583
We do?

272
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:22,418
What?

273
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:03,990
You okay?

274
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,530
Huh? Yes.

275
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,970
I like it better with Ji-woon.

276
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:18,039
Of course.
He's your boyfriend.

277
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,238
I'm leaving.

278
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,210
Okay.
Should I walk you?

279
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:24,839
No, it's okay.

280
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:29,088
Yoon-jung,
we should take a picture.

281
00:48:29,088 --> 00:48:31,215
Oh, right.

282
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,959
Wait, wait.

283
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:46,303
What?

284
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:50,501
Tell me honestly.

285
00:48:50,743 --> 00:48:51,869
What?

286
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:57,815
Is this your revenge
against Sang-min?

287
00:48:58,351 --> 00:48:59,841
You don't wanna do it?

288
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:05,787
No, I wanna do it.

289
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:48,831
You like being with me?

290
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,102
You're no different.

291
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,352
"Do as you please"?

292
00:50:40,253 --> 00:50:41,515
That's me?

293
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:42,946
Let me see.

294
00:50:45,658 --> 00:50:46,592
It's you.

295
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:48,890
Let me draw you.
Don't look.

296
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:54,264
- What is this?
- Wait.

297
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:59,365
You're making it worse.

298
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:01,303
Fix mine then.

299
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:04,006
- Long legs...
- Make them longer.

300
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,634
## #~##...

301
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,414
- Why?
- Draw it again.

302
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:09,210
Stop it.

303
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:26,821
You're so good.

304
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:31,332
Don't let it go to your head.

305
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:33,735
I won't let you win
this time.

306
00:51:34,374 --> 00:51:37,036
Wait.
Let me gather my Ki.

307
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:40,669
Let's go.

308
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,147
Thanks.

309
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:47,216
No way.
You're going down.

310
00:52:15,815 --> 00:52:18,306
I wish I could be cool
about this.

311
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:50,238
I don't think
I can see you again.

312
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,380
Ji-woon.

313
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:12,449
Let's not do it again.

314
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:22,795
Yesterday, I couldn't...

315
00:56:22,795 --> 00:56:26,959
You're not supposed
to tell me.

316
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,700
Right.

317
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:36,999
I love you.

318
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:40,835
Ditto.

319
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:47,509
You! "Do as you please"?
What was that?

320
00:56:48,587 --> 00:56:51,818
Get back here!
Ji-woon!

321
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,184
I love you, Yoon-jung!
