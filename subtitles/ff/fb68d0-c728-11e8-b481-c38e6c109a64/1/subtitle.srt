Five Senses of Eros

3
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,565
Why there?

4
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,544
Why can't it be
a romantic place?

5
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:52,552
It's Friday night and
the traffic is bumper to bumper.

6
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,489
It had to be downtown
during rush hour?

7
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,190
So we could come up
with excuses...

8
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,830
...for standing somebody up
at the last minute?

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,740
Hello?

10
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,376
It's freezing.

11
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,315
Why don't we pick
a place to go?

12
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,258
"We"?

13
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,668
May I have
your attention, please?

14
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:54,108
A KTX bound for Busan
at 7:30...

15
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,517
Hello?
Yes, boss.

16
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:08,226
I'm at the train station
to go to Busan.

17
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,764
I'll take care of it.

18
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,262
Yes. Okay.

19
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,912
The opening ceremony footage
should be finished by today.

20
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,949
I'll have KIM deal with it.

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,989
We're moving to the reception
after the opening ceremony.

22
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,565
We might have issues
with security.

23
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:53,795
It's too far to walk,
and too close to use vehicles.

24
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,241
Beautiful legs.

25
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,278
A buddy of mine got
married recently.

26
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,457
He met his wife on a place
coming back...

27
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,119
...from a business trip
in Tokyo.

28
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,065
For those traveling alone...

29
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,863
...a seat number is like
a lottery number.

30
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,133
As soon as somebody
sits next to you...

31
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,669
...you'll know what you won.

32
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,440
A formal suit
of good quality.

33
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,617
The balance of black and brown.

34
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,552
Her job must involve dealing
with upscale customers.

35
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,058
Shades on her head in winter...

36
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:55,293
She doesn't care
about what others think.

37
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,301
Or she cares too much
about how she looks.

38
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:06,268
What arouses men the most?

39
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,640
For some, it's long legs
in sexy stockings.

40
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:13,716
Or a firm ass in a tight skirt.

41
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,016
For others,
it's long fingers holding a pen.

42
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,221
Or unpainted fingernails.

43
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:25,628
Or the movement of eyes
reading something.

44
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,232
Shouldn't you know
your SSN by heart?

45
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,575
What?

46
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:52,258
It's a business
registration number.

47
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,522
For tax purposes...

48
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,254
On a business trip?

49
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,623
Yes. To Busan.

50
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,436
What am I doing?

51
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,881
I tell my friends
a conversation with girls...

52
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,408
...should always end
with a question.

53
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,015
You know what?

54
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,677
Thanks for earlier.

55
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,247
Where are you going?

56
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,724
There you go.

57
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,326
To Cheonan.

58
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,727
Oh, I see.

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,969
That's all I have to say?
"Oh, I see"?

60
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,272
Two coffees, please.

61
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,519
I got this for you.

62
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,718
Sorry.
I don't drink coffee.

63
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,726
Okay.

64
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,229
Just one.

65
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,576
We're arriving
in Cheonan shortly.

66
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,513
Already?

67
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,352
Speed and romance
never go together.

68
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,215
Now it's time to check
my lottery ticket.

69
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,349
Be a man and go after her.

70
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,128
Only the brave win
the beauty.

71
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,343
No, I'm a highly
educated man.

72
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,140
Think of the opportunity cost.

73
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,414
If I'm late for the meeting,
I'm screwed.

74
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,555
Be reasonable.

75
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,458
It was the reason that led
Era of Romanticism.

76
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,560
Excuse me?

77
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,840
Excuse me?

78
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,368
Forget it.
What shall I do now?

79
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,811
I thought you were
going to Busan.

80
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,153
When are you doing it?

81
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,816
I mean going back
to Seoul.

82
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,385
Hold on.

83
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,727
Hello?

84
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,251
Freudian Slip.

85
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,592
This is a perfect example.

86
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,736
"When are you doing it?"
I'm helpless.

87
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,966
How embarrassing.

88
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:59,267
I told you about that
at the meeting. No.

89
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,910
Hold on a second.

90
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,022
What I meant to say is...

91
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,546
Here's what.

92
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:17,028
Give me a call
when you know what to say.

93
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,492
Are you there?

94
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,451
Hungry?
It's almost done.

95
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,455
I hope you like it.

96
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,617
Okay.

97
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,524
It looks good.

98
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:59,532
A marriage. It's a social consent
for a couple to have sex.

99
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,203
You're here.

100
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,209
Yeah.

101
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,109
You said you were busy.

102
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:09,205
I've come for her food.

103
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,544
I tried this wine in Italy
after the film festival.

104
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,920
Brunello di Montalcino.
It's really good.

105
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,016
Brunello?

106
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,120
Do you like wine?

107
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,323
No, I only drink Soju.

108
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,103
- Tell me.
- What?

109
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,074
When will I have a nephew?

110
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,348
Shut up and eat.

111
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,183
It'll ruin her body.

112
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,174
You're unbelievable.

113
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,287
When will I have
a sister-in-law?

114
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,722
So you can slave her?

115
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,656
Sure.
Why not?

116
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,218
Are you seeing anybody?

117
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,893
No. I'm not...

118
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,636
It tastes weird.

119
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,601
Good for me.

120
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,335
It's kind of flat.

121
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,205
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

122
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,811
I mean...

123
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:22,053
There's no taste to it.

124
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:28,419
Do you think
it's the ingredients?

125
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,559
Hello?

126
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,694
Hello?

127
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,661
Yes?

128
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,361
Hold on a second.

129
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,878
What I mean to say is...

130
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,470
Here's what.

131
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:25,846
Call me when you know
what to say.

132
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,119
Okay.

133
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,688
What a flop.

134
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,721
Should I back down?

135
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,689
Or what?
What else can I do?

136
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:45,670
Oh, the brave don't
win the beauty.

137
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,472
They just miss the train.

138
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,979
No, give up.
Don't go after her.

139
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,043
Damn my body!
It's moving on its own.

140
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,447
Don't talk to her.
Don't!

141
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,558
Excuse me?

142
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,686
Forget it.
What shall I do now?

143
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,033
If I wanna call you...

144
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,842
...when I know what to say.

145
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,470
I need your number.

146
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,043
Wow, it worked.

147
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,201
A curator?

148
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,966
I don't know
if you remember me.

149
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:02,411
We met on a train.
And you gave me your number.

150
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,750
Sorry I didn't...

151
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,320
Why is he out there?
It's cold.

152
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,311
Let me tell him.

153
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,121
In front of
Galleria Dept. Store?

154
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:19,061
Which one?
It has two buildings.

155
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,499
All right. Okay.

156
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,871
Hello?

157
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,567
Hello?

158
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,011
It's freezing.
Why don't we pick a place to go?

159
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,151
"Well begun is half done."
Such a romantic saying.

160
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,958
Do you like wine?

161
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,390
Do I like wine?
I love it.

162
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,094
Which one do you like?

163
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,103
Pick one.
Something not too dry.

164
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,805
The only wine
that I know is...

165
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,174
Do you have Brunello
from Italy?

166
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,880
We do have it,
but it's a bit pricey.

167
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,954
Recommend me
something else quickly.

168
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,252
Can I recommend
something else?

169
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,380
Sure.

170
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:23,584
Try Rene Barbier.
It's good.

171
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,665
And on sale.

172
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,469
Damn it.
You had to say that?

173
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,936
Brunello, please.

174
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:44,248
I filled the glass too much
and drank it too quickly.

175
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,887
But I made sure
I kept my pinky lifted...

176
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,754
...when I held the glass.

177
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,115
What did you go to
Busan for?

178
00:14:54,493 --> 00:15:00,599
An IOC meeting will be held
there next month.

179
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:05,002
What's important here is...

180
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,541
...how to make my job
sound more interesting...

181
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:14,237
...instead of boring her
with what I really do.

182
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:18,916
Who I am is less important
than how she views me.

183
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,755
My ego might feel betrayed...

184
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,814
...as its existence is
completely denied...

185
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,484
...by the untruthful master.

186
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,328
What a philosophical night.

187
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,498
What show are you
working on?

188
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,203
A photographer named
Blare Kitchener.

189
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,297
I don't think
you know him.

190
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:46,011
A chance!
Oh, he focuses on human relationships...

191
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,380
...in pure and innocent state...

192
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,316
...without any images
covering them?

193
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,479
No?

194
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,461
Am I wrong?

195
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,460
No, you're not.

196
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:14,301
But I could tell
you just memorized it.

197
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:21,871
Frankly... I know nothing
about a modern art.

198
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,174
I know you got that
from our website.

199
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,342
I wrote it.

200
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,659
God, I got caught
red-handed.

201
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,454
He does models
in ads or magazines...

202
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:43,865
...without any accessories
worn on them.

203
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,426
Just their faces.

204
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:50,304
So people can see them
for what they are.

205
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,378
To save the human nature...

206
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,278
That's right. You're good.

207
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,846
Should we try it?

208
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,250
What?

209
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,608
My favorite season
is summer.

210
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,708
Ding-dong-dang.

211
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,271
It's my turn.

212
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,910
My favorite color is red.

213
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,388
Your tie is red.

214
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,789
So is your muffler.

215
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,922
I don't really like red.

216
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:53,801
But a red tie for a suit is
often an easy choice.

217
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:59,038
I prefer Korean food
to pastas.

218
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:06,573
I prefer dramas
to action flicks.

219
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,928
I would choose work
over love.

220
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:24,631
I like her lips.
Neither too fat nor thin.

221
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,433
I...

222
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,735
I fell in love at hello
on a train.

223
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,717
Ditto.

224
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,535
I like steamed crabs.

225
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,378
I don't like them.

226
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,177
My mom always
made a crab stew.

227
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,678
I like it that way.

228
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,780
Either way, it's crabs.

229
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,519
I still don't like it.

230
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,766
Al right.
Let's go somewhere else.

231
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,529
Come on.

232
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,034
- Did you like the wine?
- Absolutely.

233
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,716
Hey. Me?

234
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,588
I'm on a date.

235
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,207
My colleague is in Amsterdam
on business.

236
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,573
A computer file she had
had been broken.

237
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,873
It won't take long.

238
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,780
Amsterdam...
What a lovely town.

239
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,289
If she were in New York...

240
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,816
...she might not have
asked her for help.

241
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,369
I'm out of wine.
Is cognac ok?

242
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,550
It doesn't matter.

243
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,450
A good view, isn't it?

244
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,923
My friend and I rented it
for a studio.

245
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,653
After she got married,
I kept it for myself.

246
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,055
Give me 30 minutes.

247
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,894
Don't mind me.
Go ahead.

248
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,435
I'm sorry.

249
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,551
She puts her hair in a bun
and starts working.

250
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:38,855
He looks out the window,
drinking cognac.

251
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,862
Watching the city
lit with colorful lights...

252
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:50,199
...he sees her reflection
in the window.

253
00:21:54,713 --> 00:22:00,310
What would be happening
in other parts of the city?

254
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:06,147
Meeting somebody...
Falling in love...

255
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,955
Feeling comfortable...
Falling asleep...

256
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,455
Falling asleep...

257
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,037
Cognac is quite strong.

258
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,482
As gently as possible.

259
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,785
Not too much tongue.

260
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,457
Those rules mean nothing
at this moment.

261
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,859
What will this kiss lead to?

262
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,670
No answer is needed.

263
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:07,539
I just kiss. Therefore I am.

264
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,463
Two people being one...

265
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,363
If it's her that I like...

266
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:37,431
...not sex itself,
...it can be called love.

267
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,444
I like her love handle.

268
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:51,220
That I have my hands on it
is a sign of love.

269
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:58,058
We're exploring each other
through the five senses.

270
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,527
A human relationship
in its pure state...

271
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,267
...without any images
covering it.

272
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,439
What a philosophical night.

273
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,462
I can't believe
what I did.

274
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:33,252
A stranger is asleep
in my bed.

275
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,963
Was I too aggressive?

276
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,791
Look at this chiseled face.

277
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,364
So handsome.

278
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,971
And cute.

279
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,311
A goatee grew overnight.

280
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:08,688
His beautiful voice
comes from here?

281
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,720
He's sleeping
as if nothing happened.

282
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:21,202
Can he be thinking
what I'm thinking?

283
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:40,222
Me, I'm Here

284
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,425
Hye-lim?

285
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,167
I'm home, Hye-lim.

286
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,507
Is she in the room?

287
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,917
Hye-lim?

288
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,163
All the lights are on.

289
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,312
Did she go out?

290
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,056
Hye-lim?

291
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,669
I missed you!

292
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,607
How are you, babe?

293
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,466
Let me dry your hair.
Turn around.

294
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,831
Like this.

295
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,151
We shouldn't.

296
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,482
Okay.

297
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,252
Put it down a bit.

298
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,495
- Stop it.
- You're so adorable.

299
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,805
Okay, okay.

300
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,439
When do you find me sexy?

301
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,943
When you're in your birthday suit.

302
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,661
When are you happy?

303
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:45,129
When you hold me
in your birthday suit.

304
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,554
I wanna do it.

305
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,770
I wanna do it all the way.

306
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,289
No.

307
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,987
Hye-lim, look at me.

308
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,198
The doctor said we shouldn't.

309
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,136
You know that.

310
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,877
For over 4 days?

311
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,350
How much do I get
for the surgery?

312
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,026
I'll call you back
when the document is ready.

313
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,524
Okay, bye.

314
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,314
Hye-lim?

315
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,558
Hey-lim?

316
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,031
Are you here?

317
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,142
Hye-lim?

318
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,736
Hye-lim?

319
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,053
There you are.

320
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,558
Why'd you stop looking
for me?

321
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,962
You won't look for me
anymore?

322
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,411
Hye-lim?

323
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,606
Hye-lim?

324
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,178
Where is she? Hye-lim?

325
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,052
There you are.

326
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,164
You'll be okay.
Don't be scared.

327
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,587
Wanna take your PJs?

328
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,661
I won't need them.

329
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,156
It feels as if we were going
on a trip.

330
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,274
I'll take this.

331
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,420
What about the lipstick?

332
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:31,016
I won't be able to shower,
and I don't wanna stink.

333
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,730
Throw in your cologne, too.

334
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,076
So I can smell it
when I miss you.

335
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,811
I'll be right by you.
Don't worry.

336
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,441
Let's go.

337
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,341
Hye-lim?

338
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,352
Won-sik, how are you?

339
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,029
No.

340
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,467
It's okay.
I should've called you.

341
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,406
Sure, I'm fine.

342
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:11,105
No. I had her cremated.

343
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,289
Okay, I'll stay in touch.

344
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,455
Okay, bye.

345
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,181
What's wrong?

346
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:34,724
Damn it!

347
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:35,592
I'm sorry.

348
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,253
- Cut it.
- Cut!

349
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,528
Let's redo it.

350
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,177
You strangled me!

351
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,644
I'm sorry.

352
00:51:55,946 --> 00:52:00,280
Are you okay?
Mi-jin was too nervous.

353
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,885
Let's redo the scene.

354
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,648
I'm so sorry.

355
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,688
I'll do better.

356
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,158
Let's redo it.

357
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,899
Why'd you get up?

358
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,205
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

359
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:28,806
I'm sorry.

360
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:36,584
You're my sister.
How could you do this to me?

361
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,846
How?

362
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:42,221
You killed me
and stole my husband!

363
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,896
Please, forgive me.

364
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,456
I was blinded by lust.

365
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,968
Don't kill me.
Please!

366
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,571
Don't kill me.

367
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,308
Cut.

368
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,660
Look real.

369
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,026
Real...

370
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,673
I was blinded by lust.

371
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,512
Don't kill me.
Please!

372
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,341
Cut.

373
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,019
We're redoing it.

374
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:58,062
Why?
I thought it was good.

375
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,799
That's...

376
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:03,165
What the hell is this?

377
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:06,299
Nobody messed up
this time!

378
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:10,943
Mi-jin's cry was off.

379
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:14,607
And the guy moved.

380
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,382
The corpse isn't
supposed to...

381
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,292
Calm down.
We're almost done.

382
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,961
He's an internationally
recognized director.

383
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,963
He must have reasons.

384
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:30,490
Reasons my ass!

385
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,628
Teach her how to act!

386
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,169
Take 31.

387
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:44,380
Forgive me.
I was blinded by lust.

388
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,407
Don't kill me.
Please!

389
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,020
Cut.

390
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,615
My gown!

391
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,880
Let's do it again.

392
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,410
We're doing another take!

393
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:37,634
I need a break.

394
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:38,828
I'm sorry.

395
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,730
"I'm sorry."
That's all you have to say.

396
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,934
Get the room tone.

397
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,007
We're getting the room tone.

398
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,542
Stay still.

399
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:13,494
I'm sorry.
Mi-jin is just nervous.

400
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,470
Go easy on her.

401
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:22,634
How long have you been
in this business?

402
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,515
About 15 years.

403
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:35,458
It's about time
you should be ripe.

404
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,720
What?

405
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:41,761
You don't know
how to deal with a director.

406
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,890
What are you saying?

407
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,970
Didn't you see the way
he looks at her?

408
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,965
It's so obvious.

409
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,907
He keeps finding fault with her
to get her attention.

410
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:03,410
You fix that,
and everything's good.

411
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,187
It's the balance
of Yin and Yang.

412
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:12,384
Don't I miss
an unripe guy tonight.

413
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,562
Get out.
I'm getting changed.

414
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,286
To kill or not to kill...

415
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,020
Cut.

416
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,147
- To kill or not to kill...
- Cut.

417
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,057
To kill or not to kill...

418
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:41,758
Cut.

419
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:42,459
- To kill...
- Cut.

420
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,660
- Not to kill...
- Cut.

421
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,662
That's the question...

422
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,529
Cut.

423
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:47,864
- That is...
- Action!

424
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,092
Not to kill...

425
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,400
Cut.

426
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,001
That's the question.

427
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,536
To kill or not to kill...

428
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:54,662
Cut.

429
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:59,576
To kill or not to kill,
that is the question.

430
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:00,668
Cut.

431
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,172
To kill or not to kill...

432
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,842
Come on, it stinks!

433
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,673
Take 127.

434
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:11,720
Action!

435
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:16,483
To kill or not to kill,
that's is the question.

436
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,525
Cut.

437
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,334
I know it' hard.

438
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,767
No.

439
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,470
Enough for today.

440
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,438
Let me try again.

441
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,142
We have other scenes
to shoot.

442
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,804
AD?

443
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,947
Let's take a break.

444
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,107
BONG?

445
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,856
Let's take a break.

446
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,848
BONG?
I got this for you.

447
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,554
- No thanks.
- It's good for you.

448
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,766
Can you give my niece
your autograph?

449
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,233
My autograph?

450
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:00,670
Your name?

451
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,663
- It's JUNG Se-eun.
- He's not in a good mood.

452
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,179
Thanks.

453
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:14,977
BONG?

454
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,012
Do you drink?

455
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,315
Why don't we go out tonight?

456
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,991
Your birthday was
the day before, right?

457
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:30,265
I got this but never had
a chance to give you. Here.

458
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,725
You shouldn't have...

459
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,167
It's a scart.

460
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,339
Let me put it on you.

461
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:43,904
A mirror!

462
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,398
What do you think?

463
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,896
I like the color
and design.

464
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:11,236
Kuty 33 is a popular brand?

465
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:15,033
It's top of the line.

466
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:19,574
Wear it until we crank up.

467
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,279
- AD?
- Yes?

468
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,784
Let's call it a day.
Wrap it up.

469
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,625
We're done for the night!

470
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,368
Being polite won't
get you anywhere.

471
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,105
It's okay. Sit down.

472
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,610
How long have you
been acting?

473
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:57,118
About 5 years since college.

474
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,148
I've seen so many girls
come and go.

475
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,760
They had nothing
but looks.

476
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,194
What?

477
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,230
They were after glamour...

478
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,269
...but didn't want any pain
that came with it...

479
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,508
Mi-jin has looks
and a good body.

480
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,806
You liked her
when we cast her.

481
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,343
You should know better.

482
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,715
Looks don't do tricks
in this business.

483
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,775
Teach her.
Give her your energy.

484
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,953
We'd appreciate it.

485
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:35,591
I'll do anything.
I can't quit now.

486
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,149
Please!

487
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,989
Thank you.

488
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,598
God...
What are you thankful for?

489
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,293
I didn't say yes.

490
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,961
Hwa-ran,
Please, teach her.

491
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:50,799
Please, teach me.

492
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:57,241
Okay, fine.
Step 1.

493
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:08,049
Feel for yourself
how attractive you are.

494
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:14,664
Be confident that
you're sexy and charming.

495
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,858
Rid yourself
of a loser attitude.

496
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,563
The past is gone.
What counts is today.

497
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,640
You're gonna turn
into a sexy icon.

498
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,205
Let your hair loose.

499
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,610
Be revealing enough.

500
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:37,047
It will spark men's
secret desire.

501
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,682
Eye contact matters
the most.

502
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,585
Look your prey
straight in the eyes.

503
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,490
Now you're reborn.

504
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,636
Cast a killing glance.

505
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,744
No, make it sexier.

506
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:07,005
Be confident.

507
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:09,452
That's it.

508
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,079
Cheers.

509
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,548
Let me make...

510
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,349
Bottom's up.

511
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,496
Mi-jin?

512
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,007
I thought you'd be
bored with me.

513
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:33,805
Mi-jin, sit beside him.

514
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:40,739
Come on, let's drink.
Bottom's up!

515
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:52,153
I know you had a long day.

516
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,260
- No.
- Oh,

517
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,793
I forgot I had a meeting.

518
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:02,028
You can sing and talk.
Have some fun.

519
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,969
Don't mind the bill.
It's on me.

520
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,477
Mi-jin?

521
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,120
Yes?
What do you want?

522
01:04:53,389 --> 01:05:01,464
We did that take 33 times
because of your cry.

523
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:05,230
Try it for me.

524
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:14,636
I guess we'll be shooting
all day tomorrow.

525
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,350
Give it some emotion
this time.

526
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,192
It's not about screaming.

527
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,823
No, make it sadder.

528
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:40,859
Think of yourself
as an alien.

529
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,712
He's obsessed with
a ghost cry.

530
01:05:55,818 --> 01:06:00,687
After 30 shots,
that's all they did.

531
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:10,424
He must be either gay
or impotent.

532
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:53,640
Give me your energy.
Please...

533
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:49,294
I killed them both
and became human.

534
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,833
Cut!

535
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,302
Okay!

536
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,214
Mi-jin, that was good.

537
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:08,706
Let's do another take.
I can do better.

538
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:14,987
I'm sorry
we're cranking up today.

539
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,724
Let's do it again.

540
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,227
Let's do it again.

541
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:26,626
I killed them both
and became human.

542
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:30,998
Cut! Okay.

543
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,768
We're done.
