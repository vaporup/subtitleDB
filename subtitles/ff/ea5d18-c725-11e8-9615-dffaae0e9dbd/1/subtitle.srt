1
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,951
Brad darling.

2
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,622
I love you.
- I know.

3
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,500
I just had to call you.

4
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,378
I'll never forget last night.

5
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,548
Especially your new song.

6
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,718
Our song, Eileen.
I wrote it for you.

7
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:01,055
Oh, Brad.

8
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,850
Would you sing it to me again?

9
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,727
Oh now?
- Please.

10
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,813
Alright.

11
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:17,446
"You are my inspiration, Eileen.

12
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,744
A perfect combination, Eileen.

13
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:30,877
Your eyes,
your hair are beyond compare.

14
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:36,632
So is it any wonder?
You captured me,

15
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,306
and now
I'm under your spell? Eileen ...

16
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,642
I hate to interrupt,
but would you mind hanging up?

17
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:51,647
Who's that? - The other half
of my party line. She'll go away.

18
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:55,359
You've been talking for 30 minutes.
My call is urgent.

19
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,740
This is an urgent call, too.
- Singing to a girl at 9 a.m.?

20
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,619
It's not your business
what he does to me. Or when.

21
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,289
Would you get off this line!

22
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:50,623
I know it's early, cher.
But I just had to talk to you.

23
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,378
Will I see you tonight?
- I'm sorry, Yvette. I have to work.

24
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,423
I have 6 songs to write
for the new show.

25
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:05,471
You'll have to eat dinner, no?
- I'll throw something together here.

26
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:10,476
No, darling, you mustn't.
You must keep up your strength.

27
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,646
I'll come over and cook for you, yes?

28
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,899
Well, if you like.

29
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,528
Thank you, darling.
- It's nothing.

30
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,613
Brad?

31
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,827
Sing me a litte of our song.
- Oh Yvette.

32
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,954
Please.

33
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:41,090
"Tu es une inspiration, Yvette.

34
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:49,265
Une parfaite combination, Yvette."

35
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,894
Would you get off this phone!

36
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,814
Who is that woman?
- An eavesdropper on my party line.

37
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:01,444
She always listens in.
lt brightens up her drab, empty life.

38
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,573
If I could call once in awhile,
my life wouldn't be so drab.

39
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,553
Must you zoom up so fast?

40
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,307
Are you jet-propelled or something?
- Good morning, Alma.

41
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,311
The laundryman's coming by.
Would you clean the cupboards for me?

42
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,900
Call the office and tell them I'll be
a little late? - What a hangover.

43
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,987
I'm afraid so.
- Why does she get stoned every night?

44
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,617
I don't know, Harry.
Maybe she's got a party line.

45
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,322
Your phone company wants
everyone to have a private phone.

46
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,994
We're putting in trunk lines
as fast as we can. But it takes time.

47
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,998
We have hundreds of applications,
which have priority.

48
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,375
There must be some way.

49
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,421
Well, if an emergency arose.
If you were pregnant,

50
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,132
you'd jump to the top of our list.

51
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,219
Being single,
I'm not quite ready for that.

52
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,724
I don't know what to suggest.
- I'm at wit's end.

53
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,894
I'm an interior decorator
and I often work at home.

54
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,774
I must make business calls.
But that man is always on the phone.

55
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:08,362
Oo you know what it's like
to share a line with a sex maniac?

56
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,539
That's a very serious charge, Madame.

57
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,586
Can you substantiate it?
- He sings love songs at 9 a.m.

58
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,422
Ooes he use objectionable language?

59
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,384
No.
- Or threats of any nature? - No.

60
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,386
Any immoral overtures?

61
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,850
Not to me.
- Ooes this bother you? - Yes.

62
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,728
No. What do you mean, bothered?

63
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,439
His conduct with all these women.

64
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:49,445
I don't care what he does,
he should stop doing it on my phone.

65
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,115
We'll send an inspector over.

66
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,953
Thank you. I'd appreciate that.

67
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,708
If what you say is true, we may have
to disconnect him. - Good.

68
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,632
Haven't you reached Jan yet?

69
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:17,431
Keep trying. If she's not here soon,
that woman is going to drive me crazy.

70
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,602
Ming dynasty in a rumpus room.

71
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,151
Mrs. Walters, be careful.

72
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,488
This is priceless.
- Really? What is it?

73
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:38,411
A 14th century crematory urn.
- A crematory urn?

74
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,581
Is anybody in it?
- Not at the moment.

75
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,334
Good. Then we can drill a hole in it.

76
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,296
A hole?
- So we can wire it for a lamp.

77
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:53,384
Mrs. Walters, we do not wire
14th century crematory urns.

78
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,803
I suppose not.

79
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,810
Jan.

80
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,731
Hello, Jonathon.

81
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,193
Hi. I got something to tell you.

82
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,779
I tried to call. But your line's busy.
- Naturally.

83
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,741
Just picked it up. How do you like it?

84
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:21,621
Marvellous. - Like the color?
- Just beautiful. - The upholstery?

85
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,165
It's yours.

86
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,294
In grateful appreciation
of your brilliant job in my office.

87
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:36,302
What? Jonathon,
you can't go around giving girls cars.

88
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,890
I do. - This your car, Mac?
- No, it's hers.

89
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,101
Is this your car, Miss?
- No, it's his.

90
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,023
Jonathon, you're sweet and generous,
but I cannot accept a gift like this.

91
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,569
Why not?
- It's too, it's too personal.

92
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,238
This?
- Yes.

93
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,201
If I gave you perfume or lingerie,
that would be personal.

94
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,161
But a car?

95
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,750
Come on. If it's yours, move it.
- Here. Send me the perfume.

96
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,213
Are you coming to my office tomorrow?
- In the afternoon. - Listen.

97
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,051
Are you sure
you don't want the car? - Yes.

98
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,803
See you tomorrow.

99
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,020
My analyst will never believe this.
- Neither will mine.

100
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,024
Good morning.
I'm sorry to be so late.

101
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,612
That's alright. Mr. Peirot and l
have had a fruitful morning.

102
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,823
Very fruitful.
- Good.

103
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,036
What are you doing with that?
- I picked it out myself.

104
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:48,708
A fertility goddess is the last thing
you need in Scarsdale.

105
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,253
A fertility goddess?
Oh dear, I had no idea.

106
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,132
Oon't forget,
I'm expecting you at the housewarming.

107
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,509
We'll be there.

108
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,347
Savage little thing, isn't it?

109
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,356
That woman has
the taste of a water buffalo.

110
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:17,904
Why do business with her?
- She's a very rich water buffalo.

111
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,781
If you ever leave me
alone with her again ...

112
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,370
Where were you? I tried all morning.
- Lover boy got started early today.

113
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,625
There must be some way
to get a private line.

114
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,796
Then say it's an emergency.
- Thank you, Mr. P.

115
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:40,092
I reported him to the phone company.
- It's about time.

116
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,595
They're sending someone over.

117
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:48,392
As for me, whatever he gets,
he deserved it. - Good.

118
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,238
I'm from the telephone company.

119
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,323
Well, hello.

120
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,745
I ...
- Yes? - I'm ...

121
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,832
I'm Miss Oickenson. I'm an inspector.

122
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,293
What would you like to inspect?
- You.

123
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,755
I mean
we received a complaint about you.

124
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,385
Well, I've never had
any complaints before.

125
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,181
Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

126
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,627
You don't have to break
the sound barrier, you hot-rodder.

127
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,175
Alma?

128
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,386
Well, I heard from the phone company.

129
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,764
I can't get a call through,
and they send me this.

130
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,144
"Your complaint
is entirely unwarranted.

131
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,314
According to our inspector,
Miss Oickenson."

132
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,774
They sent a woman.

133
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,944
It's like sending a marshmallow
to put out a bonfire.

134
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,529
Read it yourself.

135
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:28,159
You know
I never get into focus until 10 a.m.

136
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,121
"Our inspector found
Mr. Allen to be very cooperative."

137
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,208
I'll bet he was.

138
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,926
Hello?
- Miss Morrow? My name is Brad Allen.

139
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,388
Yes? - The phone company
gave me a code number for our line.

140
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,349
It's 793.

141
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:57,438
If you have any future complaints,
I suggest you call me personally.

142
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,774
If I hadn't complained,

143
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:05,613
the inspector wouldn't have found out
how friendly you are. - Miss Morrow,

144
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,199
why do
my personal affairs interest you?

145
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,953
It's not interest,
Mr. Allen. It's revolt.

146
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,331
I don't go around
complaining about your affairs.

147
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,001
I have none to complain about.
- lt figures.

148
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:24,090
What do you mean? - It's obvious
you live alone and don't like it.

149
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,217
I like living alone.

150
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,805
Oon't take your bedroom problems
out on me.

151
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,351
I have no bedroom problems.
There's nothing there that bothers me.

152
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,936
Too bad.

153
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:42,316
Let's try to be adult about this,
work out some schedule

154
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,404
where I can make my business calls
and you can make your ...

155
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,240
whatever you call them.

156
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:55,079
From the hour to the half-hour,
the phone is yours. Afterwards mine.

157
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,040
If someone gets
a call during the other's time,

158
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,753
he or she will terminate
the call as quickly as possible.

159
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,215
In emergencies,
each must be a little tolerant.

160
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:11,304
How does it sound?
- Like a UN report.

161
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,682
You disagree?
- No, it might work.

162
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,312
I hope so. We have to share
this line for at least another month.

163
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,440
We have to try
living with one another.

164
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,735
Well?

165
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,572
I was waiting
for an off-color remark from you.

166
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,992
Is that all you have on your mind?

167
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,872
Never mind my mind.
You keep to your half-hour, I to mine.

168
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,298
He makes pretty good sense.

169
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,675
Were you listening in again?
- Yes.

170
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,805
Have you no shame?
- No, he's improved many a day for me.

171
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:59,685
What made such good sense?
- Worse than a woman living alone

172
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,689
is one saying she likes it.
- I do like it.

173
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:08,945
I have a good job, a lovely apartment,
I go out with nice men,

174
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,657
to the theater, the best restaurants.
What am I missing?

175
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,494
When you have to ask, believe me,
you're missing it.

176
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:21,290
What's a girl to do? Ask the first man
she meets to come home with her?

177
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,085
No, not that.

178
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,920
lt don't work.

179
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,715
Bedroom problems.

180
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,639
Bedroom problems?

181
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,561
Bedroom problems.

182
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,523
Over here, please.

183
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,235
Just set it down here.

184
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,404
No, the other way.

185
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,826
Thank you.

186
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,412
How's it look?

187
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,749
You look beautiful.
- Jonathon, now really,

188
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,669
do you like it or ...
- Whatever you like, I like.

189
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,549
Jan, why won't you marry me?
- Jonathon, I don't love you.

190
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,759
That's absurd.

191
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:18,139
I'm young, rich, and healthy.
And I'm very good-looking.

192
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,017
I've got everything.
- lncluding 3 ex-wives.

193
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,935
Oh, that's what it is.

194
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,273
Oon't hold it against me. I was just
revolting against my mother with them.

195
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,359
I'm trying to work it out
why I dislike her so.

196
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,906
I've been in therapy for 2 years now.
- And? - It's perfectly healthy.

197
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,159
He dislikes her as much as I do,
and he's from Vienna.

198
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,953
We'll go to Mexico.

199
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,373
I've never been married in Mexico.

200
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,877
I just don't love you.
- How do you know?

201
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,423
Love isn't an opinion,
it's a chemical reaction.

202
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,134
We've never even kissed.

203
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,563
They didn't hit
the moon with the first shot either.

204
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,150
Oh Jonathon.

205
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,196
I guess that's what I want.
To hit the moon.

206
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,658
Well ...
- I'll tell you what,

207
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,577
let's have dinner
and we can try another countdown.

208
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,873
Can't do it. I have a
housewarming for one of our clients.

209
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,670
I'll call you tomorrow.
If I can ever get through.

210
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,840
Call between the half-hour and hour.
- Why?

211
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:38,928
I arranged a cease-fire.
- Marry me. You'll get tons of lines!

212
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,347
I'd better leave.

213
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,350
That could sweep a girl off her feet.

214
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,941
Hi, Alma.

215
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,528
Any calls?

216
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,322
Shhh. It's him.

217
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,546
Mr. Allen, you're on my half-hour.

218
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,674
Party pooper.

219
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,519
Hello?
- Never do that again.

220
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,106
We had an agreement.
You were on my time.

221
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:36,527
So I overlapped by a few minutes.
What can I do when someone calls me?

222
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,322
Be as rude as you?

223
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,743
Oo you have anything else to say?
- Yes. Get off my back.

224
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,121
Stop living vicariously
in what you think I do.

225
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:52,335
The bakery has lots of warm rolls.
Oon't press your nose to the window.

226
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,051
Come in, Jonathon. It's open.
- Hi, Brad.

227
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,346
Got any more songs ready.
- Almost.

228
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,598
Fine. Let's hear them.

229
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,808
Not now. I'm in a hurry.

230
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,854
I'm putting up
200,000 dollars for this show.

231
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:17,568
We've got a theater deadline.
- You're hobbing me. - Oh, am l?

232
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,698
I don't know. Money seems to have lost
its value these days.

233
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,370
With 200,000 dollars, my grandfather
cornered the wheat market.

234
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,707
Today, you can't scare songwriters
with it. - That's inflation for you.

235
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,584
Pour yourself a scotch.

236
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,670
Thanks.

237
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,715
You're prejudiced against me
because I'm part of a minority group.

238
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,218
What minority group?

239
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,222
Millionaires. You outnumber us,
but you'll never get us.

240
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,518
We'll fight for our rights.
And we've got the money to do it.

241
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,396
You sound absolutely bitter.

242
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,357
You don't know
what this show means to me.

243
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,777
We went through college together.
You worked your way through.

244
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,656
You're an important songwriter now.
You've had some Broadway hits.

245
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,410
You started out with nothing
and you've made it far.

246
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:12,290
I started out with 8 million dollars,
and I've still got 8 million dollars.

247
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,084
I just can't seem to get ahead.

248
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,630
Who's the girl?
- What girl?

249
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,091
Come on, you can't kid me.

250
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,095
I've been through 3 marriages
with you. You're like a fighter.

251
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,681
Only ambitious on the way to the ring.

252
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,101
Well, there's a girl.

253
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,690
Brad,
she's the sweetest, the loveliest,

254
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,402
the most talented person I've met.
- Like the stripper.

255
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,280
She was an exotic dancer.

256
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,449
With trained doves.

257
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,328
When's the happy occasion?

258
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,372
Well, I don't know for sure.

259
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,250
She claims to not want to marry me.

260
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,545
Note, that's
what all my wives said at first.

261
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:04,926
Mind if I call her up?
- Go ahead. What's her name? - Jan.

262
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,681
Jan? Who?

263
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,517
Jan ...

264
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,981
I'm not going to tell you.
I may be neurotic, but I'm not crazy.

265
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,277
Busy. I can never get her.

266
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,197
She shares it with some nut.

267
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,451
lt couldn't be.

268
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,915
Or could it?

269
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:39,794
A nut?

270
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,089
Some guy with a phone fetish.

271
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:47,802
She had to make a deal with him to use
the phone on alternate half-hours.

272
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,887
That's ridiculous.

273
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,478
A pretty girl?
- Yeah.

274
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,732
Good figure?

275
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,946
And you won't tell me who she is?
- That's right.

276
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:11,617
I found this goldmine. I'm not telling
an old claim-jumper who she is.

277
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,829
You sly dog.

278
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,335
Still busy.
Must be the wrong half-hour.

279
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,046
Brad ...

280
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,508
As a friend ... sit down, boy.

281
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:32,346
As a friend, I only hope one day
you find a girl like this.

282
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,684
You should quit chasing around,
get married. - Why? - Why?

283
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:41,022
You're not getting any younger, fella.
Sure, it's fun, it's exciting.

284
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,275
Oancing with a different doll
every night.

285
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,070
But a man has to give it up sometime.
- Why?

286
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:53,409
Because he wants to create a stable,
lasting relationship with one person.

287
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:58,289
Brad, believe me,
there's nothing so wonderful,

288
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:03,085
so fulfilling, as coming home
to the same woman every night.

289
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,922
Why?
- Because,

290
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,090
that's what an adult does.

291
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:13,221
A wife, a family, a house.
A mature man wants responsibilities.

292
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:19,393
Why? - If you want to,
you can find arguments for anything.

293
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,938
I've got to get going.

294
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,691
What do you have against marriage?

295
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,735
Jonathon,

296
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:31,364
before a man marries, he's ...

297
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,866
like a tree in the forest.

298
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:38,704
He stands there independent.
An entity unto himself.

299
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:44,669
Then he's chopped down, loses his
branches and bark. Lands in the river.

300
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,964
Then he's taken to the mill.

301
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:52,176
When he comes out,
he's no longer a tree.

302
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,764
He's the vanity table,
the breakfast nook, the baby crib,

303
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,767
and the newspaper
that lines the garbage can.

304
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:05,857
No, no. If this girl weren't something
special, then I'd agree with you.

305
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:10,069
But with Jan, you look forward
to losing your branches.

306
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,240
I've got to go.

307
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:22,874
Remember I need those songs.
- In your office on Monday. - Fine.

308
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:34,427
Hello?
- Miss Morrow. This is Brad Allen.

309
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,472
I've just gone through an agonizing
reappraisal of our situation.

310
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,767
And I'm not very proud of myself.

311
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:46,564
I've used the phone too much
and been extremely rude.

312
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,402
I'd like to apologize
and suggest we could get together.

313
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,821
For a cup of coffee, maybe.

314
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:58,326
We could get acquainted and
we might find we have a lot in common.

315
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:01,913
Mr. Allen,
we have nothing in common.

316
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,375
Not that meeting you
mightn't prove amusing.

317
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,962
But some jokes are
just too obvious to be funny.

318
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,515
Bradley, honey.

319
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,977
I've almost got it. There.

320
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,232
I can't believe it.
A song for little old me.

321
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:47,208
"You are my inspiration, Marie.

322
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:55,049
A perfect combination, Marie.

323
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,596
Your eyes,
your hair, are beyond compare.

324
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,642
So is it any wonder?

325
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:11,899
You captured me
and now I'm under your spell? Marie."

326
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,652
Oh Brad.

327
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:20,241
What a pity you have to leave so soon.
- I have an early appointment.

328
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:25,663
Everyone thinks the house is heaven.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

329
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:30,042
Good evening, Mother.
How's the party going? - Lovely.

330
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:34,005
This is my son Tony.
- Hello, Tony. - Hello.

331
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:38,259
Tony's graduating from Harvard.
He's Phi Beta Kappa, you know.

332
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:42,471
It's not a big deal.
- He's just too modest.

333
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,100
You needn't wait for a cab, Jan.
Tony can take you back.

334
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:50,646
I wouldn't want to impose.
- I'd be delighted to.

335
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,232
Thank you.

336
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,653
I do hope Mr. P. will feel better
in the morning. - I'm sure he will.

337
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,157
lt was marvellous.
- Thank you. - I'll talk to you soon.

338
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,494
Goodnight.
- I won't be long, Mother.

339
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,211
Tony, don't drive too fast.

340
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,963
I won't, Mother.

341
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,641
When do you have to be
at the Copa for the next show?

342
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,143
Oon't worry, darling.

343
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:35,983
We've got oodles of time.

344
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,136
Oh! Tony, please!

345
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:08,015
Jan, you're so primitive.

346
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,435
Tony, control yourself.

347
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:15,231
Remember,
you're a Harvard man.

348
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:19,235
Not tonight, baby.
I'm on vacation.

349
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,028
Stop it.

350
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:25,199
You're only 21.
- I dig older women.

351
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,746
Unbelievable how many arms you have!

352
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:34,125
Tony, I'll tell your mother!

353
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,253
It's your word against mine.

354
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,673
Look, I've never belted
a Phi Beta Kappa ... - Okay.

355
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,093
I'll take you home.
But first we stop for a drink.

356
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,595
No.

357
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,430
Fine.

358
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:53,561
I'm in no condition for this.
Would you please start this car?

359
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,935
Orink up.
You're still on your first one.

360
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:37,522
Your mother will be
terribly worried about you.

361
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,441
I'll pour you into a cab, okay?

362
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:45,238
You know something?
You're very uncooperative.

363
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:48,032
Just finish your drink, Jan.

364
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,410
It's nourishing.
- Stop trying to get me drunk.

365
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,788
Orunk?

366
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:58,334
I'll have you know
a Harvard man never resorts to that.

367
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:02,713
Only in emergencies.
And you, Miss Morrow,

368
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,550
are an emergency.

369
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,595
Tony, get the check
and let's get going finally.

370
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,724
No. I categorically refuse.

371
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,729
You can stay till AA comes for you.

372
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,983
I'm leaving.
- No, wait.

373
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,736
Just one dance, I promise.
- I don't believe you.

374
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,822
Scout's honor.

375
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,544
So that's the other end
of your party line.

376
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:53,973
How do we get on friendly terms?
- Anything wrong, darling?

377
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,433
No.

378
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,435
No.

379
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,819
Shouldn't you be getting changed?

380
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:11,407
There's not much to change into.
- I know.

381
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,659
But

382
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:19,499
I want you to look
especially nice tonight.

383
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,543
I want to, too.

384
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,469
Brad, my boy,
you haven't got a chance.

385
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:35,264
The minute you say who you are,
you are buck-dead.

386
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,152
But maybe
you don't have to tell her.

387
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:56,661
Are you all right?
- I don't feel so good.

388
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:01,290
Can we sit this one out?
- Of course. - Thank you.

389
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,085
I should be getting home.

390
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,420
Tony.

391
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:10,424
Get up. Tony.

392
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,473
Excuse me, ma'am.

393
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:23,479
I reckon it got
a might too close for your partner.

394
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,066
Oh, yes.

395
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:31,612
Could you ask a few waiters to help
get him outside? - Why shucks.

396
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,032
No need to call anybody else.

397
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,911
Why, boy, up-si-daisies.

398
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:46,169
I can't tell you how embarrassing
this is, Mr. ... - Stetson.

399
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,839
Rex Stetson.
No call to be embarrassed.

400
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:54,844
I'm afraid he's had too much to drink.
- We have a saying in Texas, ma'am:

401
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:59,682
never drink anything
stronger than you are. Or older.

402
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,102
Your coat, ma'am.

403
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,188
Thank you.

404
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:08,232
Thank you. Thank you very much.

405
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,611
I reckon we bring your boyfriend home.
- He's not my boyfriend.

406
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:16,866
His mother is a client of mine.
- A client? You a lawyer?

407
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:19,452
No, I'm an interior decorator.

408
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:22,246
He was taking me home
and insisted on a drink.

409
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:26,709
He wasn't trying to force
his attentions upon you?

410
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:33,841
Well ... - I can't stand a man
who tries to take advantage of women.

411
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:37,720
We make short work
of his kind back in Texas.

412
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:53,027
2268 Gardner Orive, Scarsdale, please.

413
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:58,574
Orive him slow
and set him down real easy, partner.

414
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,453
How are you getting home, ma'am?

415
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,833
I'll take his car
and he could pick it up tomorrow.

416
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,712
It's mighty late for a lady to be
out alone. - It's not far.

417
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:16,676
I'd feel better
if you'd let me see you home.

418
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,345
That's very nice of you.

419
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,389
Thank you.

420
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:29,772
Oh, that's it.
- This bitty thing?

421
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,902
Back home we got jackrabbits
bigger than this.

422
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:59,177
How do you get in?
- Try putting your right leg in first.

423
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,396
Now sit down.

424
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:14,901
Where?
- On the seat. - Yeah.

425
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:25,369
Can't you get the other leg in?
- I hope so.

426
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,955
I'd hate to leave without it.

427
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:36,422
Can you drive?
- I think I can steer,

428
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,425
but someone'll have to do the pedals.

429
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:45,223
We should call a cab.
- I think so, too. - Alright.

430
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,649
Ma'am ...

431
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:03,324
You might have to call the automobile
club to help me out of this.

432
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:12,166
You looked so funny.
- I couldn't do a thing.

433
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:18,756
What a marvellous-looking man.
I wonder if he's single.

434
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:25,805
No idea how long I can get away
with this act, but she's worth it.

435
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:42,113
Oon't just sit there.
Make some casual conversation.

436
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:47,201
A lovely evening, isn't it?
- Yes. - Are you married?

437
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:52,206
You kid. What are you doing?
Trying to scare him away?

438
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:54,876
No, ma'am, I'm not.

439
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:59,046
This may take
some fancy-looking field running.

440
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,633
All those buildings full of people.

441
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,345
Kind of scares
a country boy like me, you know it?

442
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,892
Isn't that sweet?

443
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:15,938
So unpretentious and honest.

444
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:21,194
What a relief after a few monsters,
like Tony Walters and that ...

445
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:23,529
Brad Allen.

446
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,286
They all had a large family but me.
I'm the only child.

447
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:34,040
Really? There were 6 of us.
4 brothers and 2 sisters.

448
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:39,295
That's what I call a nice size.
You don't see much of that anymore.

449
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:43,049
I believe in large familes. Oon't you?

450
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:47,053
Yes indeedy. Seems like folks now
have just stopped having kids.

451
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,764
May l, ma'am?
- Thank you.

452
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:53,518
lt must be the high cost of living.
- Or television.

453
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:58,940
Between the late-show at night
and Oave Garroway in the morning,

454
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:02,318
it seems like there ain't much time.

455
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:10,576
How about a coffee?

456
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,246
No, ma'am.

457
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:19,043
I ain't used to these hours.
Back home we'd be just getting up now.

458
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,088
Well,

459
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:26,092
it's been a real pleasure, ma'am.

460
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:29,387
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

461
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:34,016
Oon't let him go without your number.
You may never see him again.

462
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,476
Mr. Stetson!

463
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:40,773
Ma'am?
- Since you're all alone in New York,

464
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,528
if there's anything you need
and I can help, my number is Plaza 2

465
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:49,031
2-7-4-8.
- 2-2-7

466
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:50,700
4-8.

467
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:54,579
I'll remember that. Bye.
- Bye.

468
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:59,750
I'd say 5 or 6 days ought to do it.

469
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:05,923
It's so nice to meet a man
you feel you can trust.

470
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:12,096
He respected you.
He didn't even try to kiss you.

471
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,891
Maybe you just don't appeal to him.

472
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,352
He didn't write your number down.

473
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:22,023
Why didn't you think to ask
where he was staying?

474
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:33,201
Hello?
- Ma'am, this is Rex Stetson.

475
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,830
Hello. - I hope
I didn't wake you up.

476
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:44,170
Not at all. - I just had to think
about your generous offer and all,

477
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:47,632
to call you
in case I needed something.

478
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,427
I need to go out for dinner tomorrow

479
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:55,431
and I would enjoy seeing
a friendly face across the table.

480
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:58,684
But if you're busy tomorrow ...

481
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:03,856
No, I always keep tomorrow open.
I mean, I hadn't planned a thing.

482
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,901
I'd love to have dinner with you.

483
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,572
Hello, is anybody on this line?
- Yes, I am. Would you get off it?

484
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:15,159
Alright, but it's my half-hour.

485
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:19,580
Rex, are you there?
- Yes, ma'am. Who was that?

486
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:24,460
A horrible man on my line.
- He isn't very well-mannered.

487
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,797
Mannered?
He isn't even worth talking about.

488
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:29,382
Now ...

489
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:34,929
What were you saying?

490
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:40,768
I'll stop by about 7:30.
- Alright. That'll be fine.

491
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:43,604
Miss Morrow?

492
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,692
I never could make
fancy speeches, but ...

493
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:51,737
I get a nice, warm feeling
when I'm near you.

494
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:57,368
It's like being by a pot-bellied stove
on a frosty morning.

495
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:08,045
Oh Rex, what a lovely thing to say.

496
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:11,299
Goodnight, ma'am.

497
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:14,343
Goodnight.

498
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:28,900
Like a pot-bellied stove
on a frosty morning.

499
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:34,280
He does like you.

500
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,836
Hello?
- Miss Morrow, Brad Allen.

501
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:51,130
Hello? Hello?

502
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:55,885
Yes? - I couldn't help overhearing
part of your conversation.

503
00:43:56,302 --> 00:44:00,515
I'm sure you couldn't.
- I feel responsible for you.

504
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:04,560
Oon't go out with that man.
He's a phoney.

505
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:08,564
Of course, it's not my business.
- Right, it's not your business.

506
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:11,359
Oon't let that yokel act fool you.

507
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:16,113
This ranch-hand Romeo is trying
to lure you into the next barn.

508
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:19,367
Oon't judge other people by yourself.

509
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:25,122
If you don't want to listen. But l
know exactly what he'll do tomorrow.

510
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,667
You'll go to dinner, then dancing.

511
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:31,254
Then he'll find an excuse
to stop off at his hotel.

512
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:36,175
That is where the payoff comes.
- Goodnight, Mr. Allen.

513
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:08,457
This is it.

514
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,585
What?
- My hotel.

515
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:14,755
You don't mind if we stop
for a minute to get my coat?

516
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:17,341
It's a bit chilly out.

517
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:22,638
The payoff.

518
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:36,027
One thing about New York.
Nice, big hotel rooms.

519
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:38,279
And ...

520
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:42,909
mighty comfortable beds.
Come on over here.

521
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:58,716
Ain't that a pretty view
of Central Park?

522
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:03,888
Mighty romantic, ain't it?

523
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:11,020
Well, let's go.

524
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:18,778
You really came up for your coat?
- What did you think?

525
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:22,824
I thought ...
- Thought what, ma'am?

526
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:27,453
I thought
you brought me up here to ...

527
00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:31,874
Ma'am!
- I'm sorry, Rex.

528
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:38,047
I should have known you're different.
But I had to make sure. Am I forgiven?

529
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:42,969
Of course.

530
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:46,055
I guess I can't blame you.

531
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:50,309
Living in bear country
makes you wonder about strange caves.

532
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:54,230
Now, let's got for that drive.

533
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,365
This way.

534
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:07,368
I thought we were going for a drive.
- We are.

535
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:08,995
Back-home style.

536
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:21,465
You know something?

537
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:24,510
Whenever I miss home,

538
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,890
the only thing that helps
is getting behind a horse.

539
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:36,606
There's something wholesome
about a man who loves animals.

540
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:40,985
I hope this stupid horse
knows where to go.

541
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:47,033
Hangs on to the reins
like a subway strap.

542
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:52,538
I don't know what he's planning,
but I'm glad she's not my daughter.

543
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:10,640
Here is the ranch house.

544
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:15,186
Right here is the corral,
that's where I keep my ponies.

545
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:19,398
And here
behind the ranch house is a mountain.

546
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:22,485
Not a huge mountain, but it's ours.

547
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:27,865
Texas must be pretty.

548
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:31,953
Yes, it is. lt is.

549
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:37,708
I'm eating alone today.
I'll be right back.

550
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,093
I seem to be out of cigarettes.

551
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,847
Would you excuse me?
- Bye. - Bye.

552
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:21,210
Fred,
you've got to come and help me out.

553
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:26,716
I'll make you a deal. If you come
and take her off my hands, I'll ...

554
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:28,176
Fred?

555
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:34,140
Hey, Brad. Fred who?

556
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:38,686
Jonathon old pal.
Good to see you.

557
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:41,105
Your check, sir.
- Thanks, Cathy.

558
00:49:41,522 --> 00:49:44,609
Come on. I want to introduce
you to someone. - Who?

559
00:49:45,026 --> 00:49:49,197
Friend of the family. Visiting here.
Wonderful girl.

560
00:49:49,614 --> 00:49:52,366
But I wanted to work
on those songs of yours ...

561
00:49:52,783 --> 00:49:56,996
Why don't you take her over for me?
- Me? - Yeah.

562
00:49:57,413 --> 00:50:00,958
Go dancing. She's dying to learn
how to dance. - Wait.

563
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:04,420
She can't dance?
- She doesn't get out much.

564
00:50:04,837 --> 00:50:08,716
What do you mean much?
- Believe me, you and Moose,

565
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:11,469
I mean Miss Tagget ...
- Moose?

566
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:16,265
So a girl picks up a nickname.
Kids can be cruel.

567
00:50:16,682 --> 00:50:21,687
Especially if someone is different.
- Now just a minute. How different?

568
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:27,026
Well, just different.

569
00:50:27,443 --> 00:50:30,404
You know.
- Wait.

570
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,907
Is that the one there?

571
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,455
How can you tell?

572
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:47,463
See how nice and friendly she is?

573
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:54,720
Jonathon! - Are you kidding?
- You've got to help me out.

574
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:58,599
Sorry, pal. It's your moose.

575
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,602
Happy hunting.

576
00:51:05,898 --> 00:51:07,775
Yes indeedy.

577
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,418
Beatnik!

578
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:22,558
Hello?
- Morning, Miss Morrow. This is Rex.

579
00:52:22,975 --> 00:52:27,939
Good morning, Rex.
- You done did a terrible thing to me.

580
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:31,526
You made me glad I ain't in Texas.

581
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:34,654
Have l?

582
00:52:35,696 --> 00:52:37,573
Every time I look at you, I say:

583
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:43,162
we got all kinds of natural resources
back home, we ain't got that.

584
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:48,084
Oh Rex.
- Tell you something else, too.

585
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,087
I hated New York when I first came.

586
00:52:51,504 --> 00:52:54,966
All those people
seemed so distant and all.

587
00:52:56,008 --> 00:52:59,804
Oon't feel that way now.
- That's good.

588
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:04,433
lt sure turned out
to be a friendly town.

589
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:08,855
You'll find that most people
will try to meet you halfway.

590
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:13,025
If you let them.
- Will I see you tonight?

591
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:17,155
I'd love to, Rex,
but I already have a date tonight.

592
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:22,118
Who with? - A client.
You don't know him. Jonathon Forbes.

593
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,207
You ain't the kind of gal
who'd break a date.

594
00:53:28,624 --> 00:53:30,168
No, I'm not.

595
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:32,837
And I ain't the kind of guy
that'd ask you to.

596
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:37,383
I know that. - I'll pick you up at 8.
- I'll be ready.

597
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:41,929
What a day.

598
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:45,308
Good morning, Alma.
Isn't it a beautiful day?

599
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:47,894
You can't go by me. Haven't seen it.

600
00:53:49,395 --> 00:53:51,981
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

601
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:56,777
He must be pretty special
if you'd break a date for him.

602
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:02,074
He is.

603
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,410
What's he like?

604
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:07,455
He's six-foot-six,

605
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:10,875
handsome, intelligent,

606
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:15,129
owns a mountain.
- Oon't just stand there.

607
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:18,424
Get that robe off
and go get him. - What?

608
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:22,136
Six-foot-six-inches of opportunity
doesn't come every day.

609
00:54:23,638 --> 00:54:25,806
Alma, I hardly know the man.

610
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:29,685
Takes only one sip of wine
to tell if it's a good bottle.

611
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:34,816
This one is good.

612
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:38,361
What are you waiting for? Orink up.

613
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:43,699
Jan, are you evading my question?
- Would you like these initialled?

614
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:47,036
Why did you break our date?
Had another date, huh?

615
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:50,456
You're going out with someone else?

616
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:53,626
Right?
- What a cruel thing to say.

617
00:54:54,043 --> 00:54:56,963
Who is he? - Rex Stetson.
- Oo I know him? - No.

618
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,299
He's visiting from Texas.
- Texas!

619
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:05,596
Jan, how could you ever fall in love
with a tourist?

620
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:10,810
I don't know, I just did.
- You admit it. You love him.

621
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:17,150
I did, didn't l?
- I'll never understand women.

622
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:21,154
What a blow to my psyche.

623
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:25,241
Rejected for a cowboy.
- He's not a cowboy.

624
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:28,161
Alright, an oilman.

625
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:31,706
Jan, if you marry him,
you'll have to live out there.

626
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,166
Look at that.

627
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,168
New York!

628
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:39,755
People jostling, shoving, flailing
for their lives. You're part of it.

629
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:44,260
In Texas there's nothing
but a bunch of prairie dogs and stuff.

630
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:46,679
Even the air is nothing but air.

631
00:55:47,096 --> 00:55:50,224
You can feel the air in New York.
It's got character.

632
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:53,811
Jan, you can't live in Texas.

633
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:59,775
We haven't even talked about marriage.
- But it's in your look.

634
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:03,821
I know well enough when a girl
is willing to talk about it.

635
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:09,368
Oo I look willing?
- You look disgusting.

636
00:56:12,663 --> 00:56:17,293
I'm sorry. You know me.
I say a lot of things I don't mean.

637
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,670
I just want you to be happy.

638
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:24,258
If you want Rex Stetson,
I hope you get him.

639
00:56:56,415 --> 00:56:58,334
Excuse me.

640
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,087
May I help you?

641
00:57:02,129 --> 00:57:03,756
Yes.

642
00:57:04,173 --> 00:57:06,175
I need an appointment.

643
00:57:06,592 --> 00:57:08,928
For your wife?
- No, I'm not married.

644
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:14,934
For myself.

645
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:22,942
The doctor should examine you?
- I'm not feeling too well.

646
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,488
Maybe just an upset stomach,
but a guy can't be too careful.

647
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:31,033
I'll tell the doctor you're here.

648
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:36,122
There's no need to break in.
I let it go this long,

649
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:41,127
I can put it off another few days.
- He'll be very anxious to see you.

650
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:57,185
Tell her I'm feeling much better.

651
00:57:57,602 --> 00:58:00,646
It's probably just a false alarm.

652
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:08,696
Where is he?
- He must have just gone.

653
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:11,949
Excuse me.

654
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:19,499
A man said he was going to have
a baby and you let him go?

655
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:24,587
He was obviously a psychopath.
- And if he wasn't? - But Or. Maxwell.

656
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:30,218
Miss Resnick, medical science
still has many unknowns to explore.

657
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:38,226
You're the detective agency. I only
know his name and where he's from.

658
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:40,770
I want everything on him.

659
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:46,651
You helped me with 3 divorces.
Now how about a marriage. What?

660
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:50,154
If it saves time, I'll be right over.

661
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:51,948
Yes?

662
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:56,327
Mr. Allen is here.
- I can't see him. - Sure can.

663
00:58:56,744 --> 00:59:00,790
I give you three solid-gold hits.
- Leave them on my desk.

664
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:04,544
Where are you going?
- Remember that girl Jan?

665
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:07,296
Who?
- Jan, with the party-line nut.

666
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:12,927
Oh yeah. What about her?
- She met a Texas cowboy

667
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:17,723
and fell for him. - How do you know?
- She told me. But I'll break it up.

668
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:24,397
You will? - Yeah. - How?
- He needs to get up early to best me.

669
00:59:32,446 --> 00:59:35,074
Hello?
- Miss Morrow, Brad Allen.

670
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:38,286
I'm in a hurry. If you don't mind.
- Of course.

671
00:59:38,703 --> 00:59:42,665
But you must admit, I was right.
- About what?

672
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:46,961
Your Wild West gentleman.
He turned out to be a prairie wolf.

673
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:49,547
This may surprise you,

674
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:53,217
but there are some men
who are little more cultivated.

675
00:59:53,634 --> 00:59:57,722
You mean he didn't try to get you
up to his hotel room?

676
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:00,433
Yes, he took me there.

677
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:05,730
He showed me Central Park.
- And nothing else? - Nothing.

678
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:11,027
Worse than I thought.
- Worse? What do you mean?

679
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:14,447
Must I spell it out?

680
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:18,910
Either you're lying, or ...
- Or what?

681
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:24,207
There are some men
who are devoted to their mothers.

682
01:00:24,624 --> 01:00:28,044
The type that likes to collect recipes

683
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:30,296
or exchange bits of gossip.

684
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:35,259
What a vicious thing to say.
- I hope I'm wrong, but ...

685
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:40,264
Shouldn't you make sure?
- You are sick.

686
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:44,685
This isn't Rex Stetson. This is ...

687
01:00:46,103 --> 01:00:47,396
my best friend.

688
01:00:48,147 --> 01:00:53,361
They're usually the ones.
- I can't believe it.

689
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,949
Hello? It's for you.
- Thanks.

690
01:00:58,366 --> 01:00:59,408
Graham.

691
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:03,538
Good work.

692
01:01:03,955 --> 01:01:05,998
Get your coat, Mr. Forbes.
- Why?

693
01:01:06,415 --> 01:01:11,671
I had someone tail him. He and the
girl just went into The Hidden Ooor.

694
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:14,590
The Hidden Ooor.

695
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:19,762
My psychiatrist was right.
Never trust anyone other than him.

696
01:01:25,852 --> 01:01:29,188
Is this "Roly-Poly"?
- Yes, it is. - I love it.

697
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:40,783
He's a fat one.

698
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:47,915
Come on.

699
01:02:02,096 --> 01:02:03,514
You know this.

700
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:06,184
I don't know all the words.
- Come on, Jan.

701
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:08,144
"When I first laid eyes on him

702
01:02:08,561 --> 01:02:10,605
I laughed like all the rest.

703
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:15,485
The more I saw
the more of him I liked best.

704
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:20,198
Now the roly-poly man,
I point at him with pride.

705
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:24,702
He's my roly-poly man,
I'm satisfied. I call him

706
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,288
Ya-Ya Roly-Poly ..."

707
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:40,927
Sing another one.

708
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:42,887
Another one?

709
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:48,810
"Just to put my arms
around him takes a week.

710
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:52,980
But when I do,
we cuddle cheek-to-cheek.

711
01:02:53,397 --> 01:02:57,443
Got a roly-poly baby,
sweet as I can find.

712
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,988
He's just a roly-poly,
that's only mine.

713
01:03:01,405 --> 01:03:04,742
I call him
- Roly-Poly ..."

714
01:03:25,888 --> 01:03:31,102
Thanks. That's great.
- Wasn't that fun? I love that.

715
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:42,280
Tell me about your job.
lt must be exciting,

716
01:03:42,697 --> 01:03:46,159
working with all them colors
and fabrics and all.

717
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:56,919
Rex ...

718
01:04:03,176 --> 01:04:04,218
Like some dip?

719
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:07,346
I'd love to.

720
01:04:08,389 --> 01:04:09,724
Thank you.

721
01:04:16,939 --> 01:04:21,110
Ain't this tasty?
Wonder if I could get the recipe.

722
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:26,115
Sure would like to surprise
my ma, when I get back.

723
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:34,832
Rex, don't you find me attractive?

724
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:40,546
Why yes, of course.

725
01:04:40,963 --> 01:04:44,133
Why haven't you ever ...
- Ever what?

726
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:51,474
I feel so foolish.
- No. Go on, say what's on your mind.

727
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,979
Whenever we go out
you've been a perfect gentleman.

728
01:04:57,396 --> 01:05:02,360
I hope I have.
- You have. And I appreciate it.

729
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:05,071
But ...
- Yes?

730
01:05:05,488 --> 01:05:09,909
Well ... being such
a perfect gentleman and all,

731
01:05:10,326 --> 01:05:14,080
it's not very flattering.

732
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:20,044
I wouldn't want to do anything
that might spoil our friendship.

733
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:25,842
Is that all it is?

734
01:05:26,884 --> 01:05:27,927
Friendship?

735
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:33,933
That's a direct question.
lt deserves a direct answer.

736
01:05:57,331 --> 01:05:59,083
If you'll excuse me.

737
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,837
I'd better go to the powder moon.
I mean room.

738
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:05,339
Fix my lipstick.

739
01:06:18,644 --> 01:06:21,314
There's our man.
- Yes, I know him.

740
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,278
I can handle it from here.

741
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:34,076
Need a light, cowboy?

742
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:42,877
When are you leaving for the range?
- That's up to you.

743
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:45,379
You've got 2 minutes.

744
01:06:45,796 --> 01:06:49,509
Oo this nice and clean,
so no one's embarrassed.

745
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:52,929
When she gets back,
you'll say goodbye.

746
01:06:53,346 --> 01:06:55,640
You'll put her in a cab.

747
01:06:56,057 --> 01:06:59,310
And we'll go home and you'll pack.

748
01:06:59,727 --> 01:07:02,522
Where am I going?
- Connecticut.

749
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:05,566
My summer house
is perfect for writing songs.

750
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:09,320
No phone
and 20 miles to the nearest girl.

751
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:16,536
Looks like I haven't much choice.
- Sure looks like it.

752
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:21,123
Remember, I'll be watching you.

753
01:07:31,467 --> 01:07:34,178
Ma'am.
- Hello.

754
01:07:40,893 --> 01:07:44,605
I'm sure going to miss you,
leaving New York and all.

755
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:47,275
You're leaving?
- Yeah.

756
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:51,737
When? - Tonight.
I have to mosey up to Connecticut.

757
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:54,240
Oidn't I tell you?
- No.

758
01:07:55,616 --> 01:07:56,659
No.

759
01:07:57,076 --> 01:07:59,537
This friend of mine,
a business associate,

760
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:03,624
has a house up there
and he nearly forced me to use it.

761
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:07,086
I just couldn't refuse him.

762
01:08:07,503 --> 01:08:11,215
Why must you ...?
- I may be buying the place ...

763
01:08:11,632 --> 01:08:14,510
I kind of want to get the feel of it.

764
01:08:18,681 --> 01:08:22,477
How long will you be away?
- For the weekend.

765
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:24,854
It's going to be lonely.

766
01:08:29,108 --> 01:08:30,943
You wouldn't consider ...

767
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,446
Consider what?

768
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:38,534
I'm afraid I couldn't ask you that.
- Ask me.

769
01:08:38,951 --> 01:08:40,286
Well ...

770
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:44,916
No. lt wouldn't be proper.
- Rex, we're both over 21.

771
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:47,627
I mean ...

772
01:08:48,044 --> 01:08:50,505
I must be able to trust you by now.

773
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,300
Ma'am,

774
01:08:54,717 --> 01:08:59,847
if I sent you home in a taxi,
how long would you need to pack?

775
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:05,186
About an hour. - 45 minutes.
- We're wasting time.

776
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,110
"You lied,

777
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:16,155
you dog,

778
01:09:16,572 --> 01:09:21,077
and you'll be sorry.

779
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:29,085
You lied, you hound.

780
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:31,963
And that's not fair."

781
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,241
Hello?
- Mr. Allen.

782
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:03,870
So you realize
how wrong you are about Rex Stetson,

783
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,415
he just asked me to go away
with him.

784
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:09,208
He didn't.

785
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,335
Are you going?

786
01:10:12,503 --> 01:10:15,631
That is something you'll never know.

787
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:25,975
"You are my inspiration,
Jan Morrow."

788
01:10:36,402 --> 01:10:38,571
All set?
- All set.

789
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,201
Just to make sure you work up there.

790
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:45,244
I'll do my best.

791
01:10:45,661 --> 01:10:47,371
You better.

792
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:55,671
Off you go.

793
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,676
I feel guilty. I practically tricked
him into taking me along.

794
01:11:42,093 --> 01:11:44,971
You've gone out
with a lot of men before.

795
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:47,765
But this is the jackpot.

796
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:51,978
You cold?
- No. It's wonderful.

797
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,939
If he only knew what I was thinking.

798
01:11:56,774 --> 01:11:58,860
"Hold me tight

799
01:11:59,277 --> 01:12:02,738
and kiss me right.

800
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:06,367
I'm yours tongiht.

801
01:12:06,784 --> 01:12:11,122
My darling, possess me.

802
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:19,672
Tenderly and breathlessly.

803
01:12:20,089 --> 01:12:23,301
Make love to me.

804
01:12:23,718 --> 01:12:28,014
My darling, possess me.

805
01:12:31,142 --> 01:12:32,727
Near to me ...

806
01:12:33,769 --> 01:12:37,899
When you're near to me,

807
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:45,740
my heart forgets to beat.

808
01:12:50,953 --> 01:12:56,918
Stars that shine make dreams divine.

809
01:12:57,335 --> 01:13:00,421
So say you're mine

810
01:13:00,838 --> 01:13:05,092
and my darling, possess me."

811
01:13:10,139 --> 01:13:11,974
What did you say?

812
01:13:12,975 --> 01:13:14,977
Oidn't you say something?
- Me?

813
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:16,771
No.

814
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:32,036
May I help you?
- Yes.

815
01:13:32,453 --> 01:13:37,250
I've been trying to call
Miss Morrow and there's no answer.

816
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:41,254
I wonder if anything is wrong.

817
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:45,132
She's gone to Connecticut
for the weekend.

818
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:51,305
Connecticut? - There's no phone number
but I have an address.

819
01:13:51,722 --> 01:13:54,225
241 Stony Brook Road?

820
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:57,478
Why, yes, sir.
- And you let her go?

821
01:13:57,895 --> 01:14:01,357
lt wasn't my place ...
- No.

822
01:14:01,774 --> 01:14:05,069
It's my place.
And I helped him pack.

823
01:14:25,089 --> 01:14:26,966
Remember when I said

824
01:14:27,383 --> 01:14:32,972
that being near you is like being
near a pot-bellied stove? - Yes.

825
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:37,518
I was wrong.
- You were?

826
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:39,687
More like a forest fire.

827
01:14:40,104 --> 01:14:42,565
Completely out of control.

828
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:57,538
You know something?

829
01:14:57,955 --> 01:15:00,750
Out here in the country
you're very different.

830
01:15:02,835 --> 01:15:06,672
I reckon I feel more at home.
For the first time.

831
01:15:08,424 --> 01:15:11,219
A man with a mountain
doesn't belong in the big city.

832
01:15:37,537 --> 01:15:39,539
Fire's nearly out.

833
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:46,295
I'd better get some more logs.

834
01:15:52,176 --> 01:15:53,803
For later.

835
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:38,598
Hurry back.

836
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:44,145
Quicker than a cow-poke
chasing a chuck wagon.

837
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:49,854
Jan, I ...

838
01:19:09,415 --> 01:19:11,959
Jan, please.

839
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:16,172
Stop.
- Jonathon. - It's Brad Allen.

840
01:19:16,589 --> 01:19:18,966
I know that.
- He's a double-crossing rat.

841
01:19:19,383 --> 01:19:21,677
I know that.
Will you please take me home?

842
01:19:22,094 --> 01:19:23,888
Of course.

843
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:28,434
Bedroom problems.

844
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:34,774
Mine can be solved in one bedroom.
Yours couldn't be solved in 1,000.

845
01:19:37,693 --> 01:19:41,864
At least you could have brought
your own champagne.

846
01:20:31,497 --> 01:20:35,877
Jan,
you've been crying for 60 miles now.

847
01:20:36,294 --> 01:20:39,130
I know it.

848
01:20:39,547 --> 01:20:41,924
Oon't you think you can stop?

849
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:45,553
I can't.

850
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:04,947
A coffee will make you feel better.
- Excuse me. - That's fine, come on.

851
01:21:18,252 --> 01:21:20,171
Two coffees, please.

852
01:21:21,923 --> 01:21:24,592
Control yourself, Jan.

853
01:21:25,009 --> 01:21:28,721
I've never done this before.
- There has to be a first time.

854
01:21:29,138 --> 01:21:32,975
You don't have to come apart over it.
- I'm so ashamed.

855
01:21:33,392 --> 01:21:36,479
Poor kid.
- The guy drives a big car

856
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:40,358
with all the extras.
Thinks he can get away with it.

857
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:44,320
I thought we were going to marry.
- Forget it.

858
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:49,659
Jan, you're becoming hysterical.

859
01:21:50,076 --> 01:21:54,747
I can't help it. - I hate to do it.
But it's for your own good.

860
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,045
You see?

861
01:22:01,462 --> 01:22:02,630
You see?

862
01:22:10,721 --> 01:22:11,764
Jonathon!

863
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:17,103
Jonathon!

864
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,027
Your coffee, Mr. Forbes.

865
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,415
Hello, Jonathon!

866
01:22:39,959 --> 01:22:41,627
What happened?

867
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:46,174
I was jumped by 5 or 6 ruffians.
- What? - Just put it down.

868
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:49,677
By rights
these loose teeth belong to you.

869
01:22:50,094 --> 01:22:52,889
I was only trying to stop her crying.
- Oid she cry?

870
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:57,059
Cry? I didn't know a woman that size
had so much water in her.

871
01:22:57,477 --> 01:22:59,937
Have you seen her? - No.
- Have you talked to her? - No.

872
01:23:00,354 --> 01:23:04,567
My psychiatrist and my dentist said
I should give her up.

873
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:06,944
Where have you been the last 3 days?

874
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:10,239
I stayed up there,
working on the new songs.

875
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:13,367
What have you done?
- This.

876
01:23:13,784 --> 01:23:16,579
And this. And this.
- Go on.

877
01:23:16,996 --> 01:23:21,292
I couldn't come up with a thing.
I sat there, feeling guilty.

878
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:23,002
Guilty? You?

879
01:23:23,419 --> 01:23:28,341
I saw you work on 3 sisters at once.
You came up with your best songs.

880
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:33,221
Now, just one girl makes you feel
guilty? - I don't know.

881
01:23:33,638 --> 01:23:38,351
What do you know. You're in love.

882
01:23:38,768 --> 01:23:41,312
The mighty tree has toppled.

883
01:23:41,729 --> 01:23:45,525
For years I've been waiting
for them to yell "timber" over you.

884
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:49,028
You could be right.
- You're darn right.

885
01:23:49,445 --> 01:23:53,658
You love her
and she can't stand you.

886
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:56,744
That's wonderful.
Wonderful.

887
01:23:57,161 --> 01:24:00,248
It's almost worth the loose teeth.

888
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:03,918
Yeah?
- Miss Morrow is here.

889
01:24:04,335 --> 01:24:07,588
Tell her to come in.
- Is there a back way out?

890
01:24:08,005 --> 01:24:10,133
This'll be fun.

891
01:24:12,635 --> 01:24:14,387
Good morning.
- Jan.

892
01:24:14,804 --> 01:24:16,931
Here's the painting I mentioned.

893
01:24:17,348 --> 01:24:20,643
Let's get on with the hanging.
You know Brad Allen, don't you?

894
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:24,021
The ex-Rex.

895
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:30,444
The tables are coming at 4.
- Fine.

896
01:24:36,576 --> 01:24:37,785
Jan!

897
01:24:38,578 --> 01:24:39,996
Jan, wait.

898
01:24:42,498 --> 01:24:44,792
I don't blame you for hating me.

899
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:48,462
I'm trying to apologize.

900
01:24:55,052 --> 01:24:56,762
Excuse me.

901
01:25:12,945 --> 01:25:17,492
Where did he go?
- I don't know, but he came out there.

902
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:20,620
You let him go again?
- You don't believe ...

903
01:25:21,037 --> 01:25:25,124
A prejudiced view never advanced
the cause of science.

904
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:30,505
Somewhere there may be a man
who's crossed a new frontier.

905
01:25:33,925 --> 01:25:36,844
How do I get her back?
- You don't.

906
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:40,139
You suffer and I watch.
- There must be a way.

907
01:25:40,556 --> 01:25:42,683
There's got to.
- What a delightful situation.

908
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:47,563
The great Brad Allen, chopped down
and floating with the rest of us logs.

909
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:52,151
To win over a girl, you're nice
to her dog. - No dog.

910
01:25:52,568 --> 01:25:56,405
Then you're nice to her mother.
- Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

911
01:25:56,823 --> 01:25:59,742
If worse comes to worse,
you work on her maid. - Alma?

912
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,829
You couldn't get to first base.

913
01:26:03,246 --> 01:26:04,747
Alma.

914
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:24,016
Thanks a lot.

915
01:26:29,438 --> 01:26:31,732
Excuse me.
May I talk to you?

916
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,192
Yes.

917
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:38,406
My name is Brad Allen, and ...
- Mr. Allen, of course.

918
01:26:39,448 --> 01:26:42,160
Get lost.

919
01:26:42,577 --> 01:26:46,372
I'd know that voice anywhere.
- You know me?

920
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:51,377
"You are my inspiration, Alma."

921
01:26:51,794 --> 01:26:53,045
The telephone.

922
01:26:53,671 --> 01:26:58,968
I'm one of the most devoted listeners.
- Thank you. - That's okay.

923
01:26:59,552 --> 01:27:03,723
It's chilly out here. How about
we stop for a drink somewhere?

924
01:27:04,765 --> 01:27:06,893
I don't usually.

925
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:10,313
I might have one.
- Good.

926
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:15,318
I know a nice little bar.
- I know a better one.

927
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:22,450
Another one?

928
01:27:23,743 --> 01:27:26,329
No?
- No.

929
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:30,917
Let's take this problem
from the beginning.

930
01:27:31,334 --> 01:27:36,130
You're in love with her
and you want to win her back.

931
01:27:36,547 --> 01:27:40,051
The first thing you do
is get her to talk to you.

932
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:42,845
Right?
- Right.

933
01:27:43,262 --> 01:27:45,264
It's really very simple.

934
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:49,477
You've got an apartment.
She decorates them.

935
01:27:49,894 --> 01:27:52,939
You hire her to do your place.

936
01:27:53,356 --> 01:27:58,277
Two people decorating an apartment
are pretty intimate. - lntimate.

937
01:27:58,694 --> 01:28:00,863
She's got to talk to you.

938
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,200
Clever?
- Clever.

939
01:28:04,617 --> 01:28:08,746
Once you start talking
it's only a matter of time.

940
01:28:09,163 --> 01:28:10,581
Now remember,

941
01:28:10,998 --> 01:28:14,836
you hire her
to decorate your apartment.

942
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:19,006
Okay?
- Okay.

943
01:28:21,551 --> 01:28:23,594
Happy?
- Happy.

944
01:28:24,971 --> 01:28:27,807
Would you care for a little snack?

945
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:46,367
Hi, slugger. This'll fix you up.

946
01:28:46,784 --> 01:28:49,954
How do you feel?
- Oh, boy.

947
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:53,499
I've had hangovers before,
but this one ...

948
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:57,003
Even my hair hurts.
- And you wanted to get her drunk.

949
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:01,299
The bottle of scotch was okay.
I lost her halfway through the vodka.

950
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:05,428
This'll fix you up.
It's got a lot of olive oil in it.

951
01:29:07,054 --> 01:29:10,391
The State Oepartment could use her.

952
01:29:10,808 --> 01:29:13,603
What a party girl she'd be in Moscow.

953
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:17,690
And two raw eggs.
- Oh, go away.

954
01:29:18,816 --> 01:29:20,985
Oidn't you find out anything?

955
01:29:22,528 --> 01:29:27,617
All I remember is this voice,
swimming through the scotch:

956
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:30,703
"You've got an apartment.
She decorates them."

957
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,748
"Right?"
- Right.

958
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:40,129
Of course. Where does she work?

959
01:29:40,546 --> 01:29:44,884
Pierot's.
But she won't talk to you.

960
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:46,511
But Pierot will.

961
01:29:46,928 --> 01:29:49,180
You know the number?
- Yeah.

962
01:29:52,141 --> 01:29:53,351
Oial it.

963
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:01,776
Not so loud.

964
01:30:04,737 --> 01:30:06,155
What do you think?

965
01:30:07,573 --> 01:30:10,034
But you threw out all my ideas.

966
01:30:10,451 --> 01:30:13,371
Well ...
- I hate to say this,

967
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:16,082
but you were right. This is better.

968
01:30:16,499 --> 01:30:19,252
If you repeat that to anyone,
you're fired.

969
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:22,755
Tilda,
when you're back from the post office,

970
01:30:23,172 --> 01:30:26,134
call Brad Allen back.

971
01:30:26,551 --> 01:30:31,347
Tell me it's impossible.
He'll have to find someone else.

972
01:30:31,764 --> 01:30:33,349
Yes, sir.

973
01:30:38,062 --> 01:30:40,606
You're turning him down?
- I have to.

974
01:30:41,023 --> 01:30:44,318
But why?
- I haven't the time for him.

975
01:30:44,735 --> 01:30:49,282
And I can't send you,
not with how you feel about him.

976
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:52,493
You shouldn't lose
a commission because of me.

977
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:56,247
I couldn't subject you
to such an experience.

978
01:30:56,664 --> 01:31:00,501
lt might be,
how would you say, traumatic.

979
01:31:00,918 --> 01:31:03,421
That's silly.

980
01:31:03,838 --> 01:31:06,924
I once had the mumps.
but I got over it.

981
01:31:07,341 --> 01:31:10,219
Mumps? - I look upon
Brad Allen like any other disease.

982
01:31:10,636 --> 01:31:12,847
I've had him, it's over, I'm immune.

983
01:31:13,264 --> 01:31:16,267
If you think you can handle it.
- I certainly can.

984
01:31:16,684 --> 01:31:18,769
It's your decision.

985
01:31:36,704 --> 01:31:40,791
Mr. Allen? Pierot.
She's coming over.

986
01:31:45,046 --> 01:31:47,965
Miss Morrow.
I was expecting Mr. Pierot.

987
01:31:48,716 --> 01:31:53,054
Mr. Pierot is unavailable right now.
If you'd rather wait until ...

988
01:31:53,471 --> 01:31:57,600
No, no. You'll do just fine.
Please come in.

989
01:31:59,769 --> 01:32:01,813
It's just a little ...

990
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:05,191
It's embarrassing.
- I'm a decorator, you're a client.

991
01:32:05,608 --> 01:32:09,779
I'm here because you are paying
for my services.

992
01:32:10,196 --> 01:32:13,366
Now, what style did you have in mind?

993
01:32:15,701 --> 01:32:18,079
Nothing in particular.

994
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:21,290
I'm leaving that up to you.

995
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:25,586
Now here ...

996
01:32:26,003 --> 01:32:27,880
This is where I work.

997
01:32:28,923 --> 01:32:32,552
Living room.
Over here is the kitchen, dining room.

998
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:34,971
Over there ...
- And up there?

999
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:36,931
The bedroom.

1000
01:32:39,767 --> 01:32:42,979
And these?
- Light switches.

1001
01:32:44,605 --> 01:32:47,942
Just switches.

1002
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:52,363
Aren't they inconvenient?
- Why, no.

1003
01:32:53,906 --> 01:32:58,578
The man who lived here before me
had very long arms.

1004
01:33:00,037 --> 01:33:01,164
Over here ...

1005
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:05,042
Mr. Allen,
I have to know what everything is for.

1006
01:33:15,344 --> 01:33:16,888
This is the fireplace.

1007
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:20,933
What does the other switch do?
- It's just a light swtich.

1008
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:22,685
Please.

1009
01:33:37,366 --> 01:33:39,785
Jan, I ...
- Why redecorate?

1010
01:33:40,203 --> 01:33:43,706
It's so functional for your purposes.

1011
01:33:44,749 --> 01:33:46,417
Not anymore.

1012
01:33:46,834 --> 01:33:51,339
That's why I want you to redecorate.
That bed is the first to go.

1013
01:33:51,756 --> 01:33:55,468
Anything you think is in bad taste,
throw it out.

1014
01:33:55,885 --> 01:33:58,805
This should be the type of place ...

1015
01:33:59,847 --> 01:34:01,098
Well ...

1016
01:34:01,516 --> 01:34:04,018
... that you'd feel comfortable in.

1017
01:34:05,436 --> 01:34:06,687
Good.

1018
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,439
Well.

1019
01:34:09,482 --> 01:34:11,317
You take over.

1020
01:34:11,734 --> 01:34:15,321
And I'll stay here
and do my work.

1021
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:19,242
I'm sorry.
You'll have to move out.

1022
01:34:19,659 --> 01:34:21,869
Until I'm finished.
- Move out?

1023
01:34:22,286 --> 01:34:25,414
You'd just be in the way
of the men working here.

1024
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:28,709
But there'll be things to discuss.

1025
01:34:29,126 --> 01:34:31,796
You'll have to give me carte blanche.

1026
01:34:32,213 --> 01:34:35,883
Well, I ... - If you feel that way ...
- No. I'll leave.

1027
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:39,137
Just do the place
the way you'd like it.

1028
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:41,430
I will.

1029
01:35:02,952 --> 01:35:04,078
Tilda,

1030
01:35:04,912 --> 01:35:09,333
call these shops.
I'm going to pick up a few things.

1031
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:14,172
We don't deal with any of these shops.
You know what their stuff is like.

1032
01:35:15,047 --> 01:35:16,090
You bet I do.

1033
01:35:16,507 --> 01:35:20,803
You didn't see that man's apartment.
He's got it down to a science.

1034
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:25,308
He pushes a button and the couch
becomes a bed with baby blue sheets.

1035
01:35:25,725 --> 01:35:26,851
Really?

1036
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:31,230
And him acting so embarrassed.

1037
01:35:31,647 --> 01:35:33,232
Big phoney.

1038
01:35:33,649 --> 01:35:38,196
He's like a spider
and expects me to redecorate his web.

1039
01:35:39,822 --> 01:35:42,867
Eileen? Brad.

1040
01:35:43,284 --> 01:35:47,038
Oear, I want you
to be the first to know.

1041
01:35:47,455 --> 01:35:52,251
I've met this girl,
I'm planning to marry her.

1042
01:35:53,836 --> 01:35:57,423
Oh nonsense,
you have everything to live for.

1043
01:35:58,674 --> 01:36:01,719
No. It's not nauseating enough.

1044
01:36:02,386 --> 01:36:04,639
That one with the 2 heads.

1045
01:36:05,056 --> 01:36:07,558
You're not serious?
- Wrap it.

1046
01:36:08,142 --> 01:36:11,229
Marie? Brad.

1047
01:36:11,646 --> 01:36:15,608
Oear, I want you
to be the first to know ...

1048
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:18,402
With big velour tassels.

1049
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:21,781
Tassels?
- Tassels!

1050
01:36:22,824 --> 01:36:25,076
Goodbye, my dear.

1051
01:36:33,626 --> 01:36:38,756
Yes, Mr. Allen. Your apartment
will be ready in the morning.

1052
01:36:41,259 --> 01:36:45,096
There's just one final touch missing.

1053
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:48,683
Goodbye.

1054
01:36:58,234 --> 01:37:02,697
Behold, Jonathon.
The work of a woman in love.

1055
01:37:03,114 --> 01:37:04,323
Oh, no.

1056
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:07,827
I hope
you saved those telephone numbers.

1057
01:37:25,636 --> 01:37:28,639
What?
- That chair, it bit me.

1058
01:37:46,991 --> 01:37:49,660
Get dressed.
- Get out. - We're going to my place.

1059
01:37:50,077 --> 01:37:53,247
I've seen it.
- So what. Get dressed. - No.

1060
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,917
Are you getting up
or do I come in after you?

1061
01:37:56,542 --> 01:37:57,710
Oon't you dare.

1062
01:38:01,964 --> 01:38:06,552
How dare you! Put me down.

1063
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:09,889
I said put me down.

1064
01:38:10,932 --> 01:38:12,767
What are you doing?

1065
01:38:13,184 --> 01:38:16,187
Where are you taking me?
Put me down.

1066
01:38:16,604 --> 01:38:20,066
Good morning, Mrs. Wilson.
- Morning. - Take me back to bed.

1067
01:38:20,483 --> 01:38:22,276
Oown, please.

1068
01:38:22,693 --> 01:38:23,945
Harry,

1069
01:38:24,362 --> 01:38:28,115
would you please call the police?

1070
01:38:33,955 --> 01:38:34,997
Harry ...

1071
01:38:35,414 --> 01:38:38,209
Alma, stop him.

1072
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:41,212
You wouldn't take me into the street.

1073
01:38:58,646 --> 01:39:02,775
If I ever get
on my feet again, look out.

1074
01:39:03,192 --> 01:39:04,944
Alma.

1075
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:10,491
That man just inspired me.
I should have done it long ago.

1076
01:39:10,908 --> 01:39:13,494
You're too nice a looking woman
to drink all the time.

1077
01:39:13,911 --> 01:39:17,039
You need a man
to take care of.

1078
01:39:17,456 --> 01:39:20,460
Then you wouldn't have
so much time to drink.

1079
01:39:20,877 --> 01:39:24,714
Harry, you're so strong.

1080
01:39:34,599 --> 01:39:37,351
They'll never believe this
back in Wichita Falls.

1081
01:39:38,394 --> 01:39:41,272
Officer,
this man is taking me up to his place.

1082
01:39:41,689 --> 01:39:46,194
Can't blame him, Miss.
How's it going, Brad? - Fine, Kelly.

1083
01:39:51,365 --> 01:39:56,412
Mommy, where's he taking her?
- I'll tell you when you're older.

1084
01:40:03,878 --> 01:40:07,507
You got me here.
Now will you put me down?

1085
01:40:07,924 --> 01:40:12,178
It's customary for the groom to
carry the bride across the threshold.

1086
01:40:12,595 --> 01:40:13,638
Bride?

1087
01:40:20,978 --> 01:40:23,231
The scene of the crime.
- Bride?

1088
01:40:23,648 --> 01:40:28,194
Why did I spend a fortune? Why did l
cut myself off from every girl?

1089
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:32,532
Why does any man destroy himself?
Because he thinks he's going to marry.

1090
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:35,785
What does he get?
- Bride? - This.

1091
01:40:36,202 --> 01:40:41,165
You did a great job here. You can stay
and charge admission.

1092
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:21,164
Ooctor!

1093
01:41:22,206 --> 01:41:25,126
It's him!
- Him?

1094
01:41:25,543 --> 01:41:30,339
Would you mind coming into my office?
- Not now, I have to see a friend.

1095
01:41:30,756 --> 01:41:34,427
Just for a moment. - I have important
news. - Only a few minutes.

1096
01:41:34,844 --> 01:41:38,848
I'm going to have a baby.
- Of course you are.

1097
01:41:40,766 --> 01:41:42,852
Wait a minute. Jonathon.
