1
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:13,039
I know a girl who
took a picture of her ...

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,676
and sent to the Queen of Denmark
and each won $ 10,000.

3
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:19,746
- It looked like what? She?
- There was shaped like a heart.

4
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:22,849
She pooped a heart and the queen
Denmark bought a photo?

5
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:26,979
- She merdou a heart.
- Do not say merdou, they say shit.

6
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,213
If merdou says.

7
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,356
- If you say shit.
- If merdou says.

8
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,692
- If you say shit. Shit, she pooped.
- If merdou says.

9
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:33,993
Shit goes to shit.

10
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,462
- If merdou says.
- There merdou.

11
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:36,863
It's like dying and dead.

12
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:41,698
- Shit, shit, shit ...
- Merdou, merdou, merdou ...

13
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:00,284
Sorry.

14
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:01,912
Are you well?

15
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:06,954
Seem ... stars seem ...

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,252
inside my head.

17
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:12,662
- John.
- Yes?

18
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:19,905
You merdou in your pants?

19
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:27,944
- The Queen of Denmark!
- My God!

20
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,483
- The Queen of Denmark!
- Get out.

21
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:34,254
She was a slut!
The Queen of Denmark!

22
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:36,779
- She loved fucking!
- My God, bye!

23
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:39,321
She wanted so much!

24
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:45,865
- Vie!
- You should go up.

25
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:47,924
- Mia!
- Vie!

26
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,068
- Mia!
- Vie, come on.

27
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,763
Tell him soar!

28
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,297
I have a lot of things
to do today.

29
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,476
Like what?

30
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,810
You're so stupid!

31
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,524
Violet, coming soon.

32
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:29,869
Stupid!

33
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:56,901
WITHOUT DESTINATION

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,767
Do you think John tasty?

35
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,309
He needs to wake up.

36
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:16,181
You should have sex with him.

37
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:18,947
Let the two have sex with him.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,857
Let's call him and say that
transaremos with it at the same time.

39
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,262
Come on!

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,899
It's gonna be crazy!

41
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,406
No!

42
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:42,679
What?

43
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:45,183
I lost my phone!

44
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,180
In my purse.

45
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:52,412
Holy shit!

46
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:05,421
Want some water?

47
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,754
For anyone who is smiling?

48
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:42,258
- For you.
- Why?

49
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:46,231
Because you make me smile.

50
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:51,697
Why are you always so sweet?

51
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,871
Why are you always so beautiful.

52
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:03,441
Today, Prashant, I'm just tired.

53
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:31,429
So I said:

54
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:36,375
I look like the kind of girl
who will buy bras ...

57
00:08:36,375 -> 00:08:37,877
take home Ios, Ios prove ...

55
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,777
and then try to return it?

56
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:42,437
I tasted one, did not fit.

57
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:29,251
Woke up.

58
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:32,389
I will ... win.

59
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:49,207
BORROWING MONEY

60
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,936
BUY GOLD

61
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:20,701
I just said "do not mess with me."

62
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,234
Shit ...

63
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,974
Minele!

64
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,350
Super Cat. Super Cat.

65
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,321
You're my little
Black and Super Cat.

66
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,632
With the great hump of the rear.

67
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:24,494
Attention ...

68
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,563
here comes the Super cat.

69
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,973
There, Super Cat.

70
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,308
Come, let's have lunch.

71
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:57,727
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
SON

72
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,363
ARE YOU A CAT cool!
LOVE, MOM

73
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,901
75 DOLLARS

74
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:17,741
And then cat?

75
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:50,741
Hey!

76
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,717
- It is now?
- No, that was you.

77
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:01,283
It ...

78
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,223
This bid networking
is crazy!

79
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:19,173
It's like that guy.
With fish, you know?

80
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:20,637
It ...

81
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:23,540
No.

82
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,274
You know that guy?

83
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:29,880
He is hungry,
fish but does not know?

84
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:32,847
And then the other guy was there ...

85
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,594
The older guy, helping him ...

86
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,330
- Teach a man to fish.
- Yeah, man! Yes!

87
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,266
This, man. Type Chicken of the sea.
Do you know?

88
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:48,533
But hey, I'm working on it, ok?
So do not worry.

89
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:51,835
Great.

90
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:53,774
And then, man, it'll be like ...

91
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,375
like, "what do you want on Hanukah?"

92
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,552
Ricky, okay guy.
I'm not your parents.

93
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:04,181
They would kill me if they knew
I'm staying here.

94
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,623
Oops, birthday?

95
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,126
Yeah, something like that.

96
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,390
Secret.

97
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,735
I like to save
these things to me.

98
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:23,532
How old are you really?

99
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:32,749
Wow, dude.
You celebrated last night?

100
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:34,819
No.

101
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,282
ACE OF 16H 04H
EVERY DAY

102
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,422
No!

103
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:42,156
I shove it in my ass
and look out for a week.

104
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:45,664
Perhaps, if you do,
pink skirt.

105
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:47,757
No, just go out in hell!

106
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,536
I want this torture
in my large intestine.

107
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:52,197
I hate it!

108
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:55,741
Maybe vibrate from time to time.

109
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:59,541
I do not care to vibrate,
I just want to destroy him.

110
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:04,215
I wonder how long it would
to decompose inside your body.

111
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,518
No, this is not possible.

112
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,214
Our bodies are not
capable of decomposing it.

113
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,223
Hey ...

114
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,859
want another round?

115
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:21,457
Is laughing at what?

116
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,763
Are you shy?

117
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:28,705
Yes, I'm shy.

118
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,233
So ...

119
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:34,536
Can I borrow.

120
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,340
Drinks!

121
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,987
Think about how her life
would be wonderful ...

122
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:43,750
if she had a cell phone
he liked.

123
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,349
You're not funny.

124
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:51,920
And you're a terrible driver.

125
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,428
We go to the bathroom.

126
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:58,964
Stop.

127
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:03,198
Jesus, why do you always have to ...

128
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:05,603
Behave.

129
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:09,178
Right.

130
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,325
God!

131
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,463
- Got a light?
- That was fast.

132
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,202
No fast. Efficient.

133
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:07,933
Got a light?

134
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:12,143
I'm pretty sure
can not smoke here.

135
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,912
I can do whatever I want.
You got a light?

136
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,805
You know the rules
about not smoking here.

137
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:20,219
I can do whatever I want!

138
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,588
No you can not.
Not when smoking.

139
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:24,146
Watch, Violet.

140
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,756
Just get me a fucking!

141
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:29,351
Just went to a bar with some friends.

142
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:34,730
You're so serious, man.

143
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,424
I love it!

144
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,673
Man, when are you going to invite me
in one of your nights ...

145
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:43,742
secret agent in the bar?

146
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:45,710
Type introduce me to your guys?

147
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,543
You really are retarded, are not you?

148
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:51,682
It's family, cousin.

149
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,479
I wish the rent
were family.

150
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:06,186
You know, maybe you should
meet the girls.

151
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:08,389
You and Violet get along.

152
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:10,558
Nifty! I'd love ...

153
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:15,774
The TVpequena was broken, right?

154
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:18,937
Shit ... Man, I clean today.

155
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,744
A little before four ...

156
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:10,611
pm.

157
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,725
People, this is not the last
helicopter out of Vietnam.

158
00:23:58,563 --> 00:23:59,996
There will be another train.

159
00:24:46,411 --> 00:24:49,403
- Just the way you like.
- Thank you.

160
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:55,951
More ketchup?

161
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,983
Sure.

162
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,455
More coffee?

163
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:06,926
Yes.

164
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,256
Ok

165
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:36,655
Ok?

166
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,661
Thank you.

167
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,667
- What!
- Eyes in the back, man!

168
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:56,341
Man, I tell you. You have to connect.
The world will fuck you if you lose.

169
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:57,899
The world has screwed me.

170
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,845
- You're an idiot.
- Yes, I am, John.

171
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:03,279
That's how I keep on top.

172
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,478
Oh, yeah ...

173
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,654
I arranged alphabetically
for you.

174
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:13,692
You know, it's funny, Jonathan.

175
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:16,183
Should annotate and send
somewhere.

176
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:17,754
It ...

177
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,190
Wow ... Busy week.

178
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,260
I'm just the delivery boy.

179
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:28,836
Do not shoot the messenger, right?

180
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:31,475
Good humor, good.

181
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:33,671
I'm happy for you.

182
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,837
Obama, baby, "yes we can".

183
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:37,473
Anything is possible.

184
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:11,909
Then turned the knob ...
Right ...

185
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:14,513
I opened the door and down the stairs ...

186
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:16,482
turning to the left.

187
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:20,516
You turn left repeatedly
to descend and exit the building.

188
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:23,394
But when you come home ...

189
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:27,186
you climb the stairs
and turns right.

190
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:31,269
So when you turn left,
you're leaving ...

191
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:34,170
but when you turn right,
is coming home.

192
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,705
And that's good.

193
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:39,367
But the handle is a trick.

194
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:41,974
It's almost like ...

195
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:45,573
if I had to go home
to leave.

196
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:49,150
Because you turn right.

197
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:51,189
Absolutely, man.

198
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,214
You are fully
getting somewhere.

199
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,529
It is as if their standards
be repeated many times ...

200
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,656
you do not know more
that the standards are.

201
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:01,695
Right.

202
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,392
Still talking about, man?

203
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:11,170
Or maybe ...

204
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,403
you only get a point ...

205
00:29:15,914 --> 00:29:18,783
that his disappointment with yourself
becomes so much bigger ...

206
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:21,616
the disappointment of his parents
with you, you ...

207
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:23,879
I do not know.

208
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:27,559
But somehow you read
with it that allows you to ...

209
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,426
reward yourself
once in a while, but ...

210
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:34,895
Only a way that
seem a compromise.

211
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:39,593
I want to commit
with it.

212
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,402
It ...

213
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,606
she is also good with ketchup.

214
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,272
Your mother left you fall head
or something like that, John?

215
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:54,853
Brother, you have to get
that beauty where you can ...

216
00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:58,256
before another idiot
take you. Right?

217
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,951
Now tell me the plan, Batman.

218
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:04,559
It's all just funny
in its irony.

219
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,329
And worse when you get older.

220
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:09,724
That shit inescapable.

221
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,498
Brother, you know, it's just life.
Love it or leave it.

222
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:15,598
Cool.

223
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:19,640
He took it to some porn site
for ex-military freaks?

224
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:23,646
It's about clarity, man.
Clarity.

225
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:25,977
Shit does not mean shit.

226
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:29,287
Unless you mean shit.
And only mean shit if you ...

227
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:32,848
need to mean shit.
So you can do shit, right?

228
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:34,582
What?

229
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:36,221
Hold the thought.

230
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:39,558
Yeah, baby, what's up?

231
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:42,499
Yes, yes, all quiet.

232
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,233
Except it ...

233
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:47,739
Yeah Right. Much in the head.

234
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:49,673
Do you know how beautiful it is?

235
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:52,640
Sure, sure ...

236
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:55,946
Lizzy wants to know if I would go
to a party tonight, John.

237
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,744
- Okay
- Vai bring their girlfriends along?

238
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,620
Jesus, Charles, by you
always have to say ...

239
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,712
Yes.

240
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:06,749
Right.

241
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:08,915
Yeah, baby, he stumbled.

242
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:12,958
Yes, he calls you later on
what, where, when ...

243
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,228
Sure, the itinerary.

244
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:19,665
Ok, calm.
Talk to you later. Ciao.

245
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:43,726
So where is the clarity?

246
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:21,660
Are you all ready?

247
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,401
- What's going on?
- Only in New York.

248
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,684
Everybody swingin '!

249
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:06,370
Stop!

250
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:09,779
And shoot!

251
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:46,400
Open the door!

252
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:51,943
Stop!

253
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,815
Not every day can be
a day at the fair ...

254
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:26,942
otherwise you would
tired of smiling.

255
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,387
Something like that. My grandmother
used to tell me that.

256
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:32,550
It ... That Charles is a part.

257
00:35:32,657 --> 00:35:34,522
Oh, dear, do not listen to Charles.

258
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,862
He's like a fish sucking
the side of the tank ...

259
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:39,297
when trying to make sense.

260
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:41,629
Hit the glass and get going.

261
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:44,402
You got a pen?
I want to give you the address of the party ...

262
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:45,926
- And I have two people in line.
- Wait.

263
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,297
Yes.

264
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:20,705
- Hi, Lizzy.
- How you doing, baby?

265
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,195
How is your day?

266
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:55,527
Paris that help me.

267
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,410
MOM

268
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:49,567
I. ..

269
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:02,812
Hey.

270
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:04,949
If you found work?

271
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:34,334
Tonight ...

272
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:39,235
some of us will take some drinks
at the bar down the street.

273
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:43,536
You should ...

274
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:48,909
come if you want.

275
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:50,453
Later.

276
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:54,388
What is your name again?

277
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:55,958
Next!

278
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:06,697
It's your birthday
It's your birthday today

279
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:11,157
- My baby was born ...
- Hi, honey, it's your mother.

280
00:45:11,368 --> 00:45:14,538
My beautiful boy!
Honey, call me.

281
00:45:14,538 --> 00:45:16,340
I'm a little
worried about you.

282
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,542
No need to talk,
if you do not want ...

283
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:21,443
call me but I know
you're right.

284
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:25,271
Ricky is with you?
Aunt Jackie ...

285
00:45:57,681 --> 00:45:59,239
I. ..

286
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,557
that not that guy ...

287
00:46:12,963 --> 00:46:14,794
with the fish.

288
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:04,270
What are you doing?

289
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,678
It's a camera?

290
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:14,880
Violet!

291
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:20,225
Lower the shit that song!

292
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:25,829
It's probably a good idea.

293
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,605
I can not hear!

294
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,741
- Begin?
- Yes

295
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,838
Welcome to my life.

296
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:12,176
Ok ..

297
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:13,647
Disconnect.

298
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:14,884
Help me move ...

299
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,584
Wait, wait, wait.

300
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:24,558
Wait, wait, wait!

301
00:49:13,176 --> 00:49:14,837
Need to prepare ...

302
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:23,817
Hey, need fire?

303
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:26,889
Yes, that would help.

304
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:29,993
What the fuck?

305
00:49:29,993 --> 00:49:32,396
- What the fuck are you doing? Turn!
- No!

306
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:33,727
- Turn!
- No!

307
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:37,765
I just do not want to talk
about those things.

308
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:40,470
It's gonna be crazy ...

309
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:43,205
show the kind of Paris Hilton
or something.

310
00:49:43,407 --> 00:49:45,398
I do not want to be an actress.

311
00:49:48,178 --> 00:49:49,770
I cleaned the whole apartment.

312
00:50:02,192 --> 00:50:04,285
Get that camera out of my face.

313
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:09,566
Do not yell at me,
his voice is so annoying!

314
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:11,301
My God, and his is not?

315
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,861
Just do not yell at me, ok?
It's a great idea.

316
00:50:28,018 --> 00:50:30,350
Not pire. It's about you ...

317
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,556
It's about both of us, ok?

318
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:33,887
Me too.
Ok?

319
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:36,850
Yes, yes, I did.

320
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:45,967
Mia, move. Hide yourself.

321
00:50:46,803 --> 00:50:48,270
I'm hiding.

322
00:50:54,544 --> 00:50:56,444
Welcome to my show.

323
00:50:56,613 --> 00:50:59,309
Oh, and put the cigarette
back in the mouth.

324
00:51:10,227 --> 00:51:11,387
Hey.

325
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:13,786
Need a light?

326
00:51:14,564 --> 00:51:16,998
Yes, that would help.

327
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:40,316
Okay, maybe try telling
something interesting.

328
00:51:57,941 --> 00:51:59,841
BE KIND OR GO AWAY
THANKS

329
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,422
My God.

330
00:52:20,964 --> 00:52:22,295
Ok, this one ...

331
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:26,870
- No, no! Seriously.
- Seriously what?

332
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,167
Seriously!

333
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,269
Wait a second.

334
00:52:30,507 --> 00:52:31,872
What? Right.

335
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:37,278
There is nothing funny
about this situation.

336
00:52:47,824 --> 00:52:49,883
The guys are not strangers?

337
00:52:52,896 --> 00:52:55,558
I think people in general are.

338
00:52:57,267 --> 00:52:58,564
Exactly.

339
00:52:58,735 --> 00:53:02,637
Tell me about your philosophy
men, women, and people.

340
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,874
I think it's very easy
generalization on my part.

341
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:12,781
Men are ...

342
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:16,476
seeking power.

343
00:53:18,822 --> 00:53:20,813
Women are looking for ...

344
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:22,785
love.

345
00:53:24,427 --> 00:53:26,725
And children are seeking ...

346
00:53:28,398 --> 00:53:30,195
independence.

347
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:51,283
- Where are you?
- Ok!

348
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:52,514
Hang in there.

349
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:01,253
How old were you?

350
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:06,364
I do not know, I was five.

351
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,633
And what happened?

352
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:11,131
Tonight?

353
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:14,642
Do you remember?

354
00:54:18,515 --> 00:54:21,177
You know, just describe, tell how it went.

355
00:54:22,452 --> 00:54:27,253
I sat at the kitchen table,
eating my potatoes and peas.

356
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:29,852
Hey, how many months
was his mother?

357
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:33,224
She was about 8 and a half months ...

358
00:54:33,596 --> 00:54:35,860
- This is very pregnant.
- It is.

359
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,425
Very close to giving birth.

360
00:54:41,471 --> 00:54:44,908
And all I remember is
look inside the room ...

361
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:47,308
after hearing my mother scream.

362
00:54:48,044 --> 00:54:52,640
I got up, went to the door
and looked inside ...

363
00:54:53,683 --> 00:54:57,449
and my father was kicking
my mother's belly.

364
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,884
And she walked away to the wall.

365
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:08,164
And then she fell near the crib
he had built ...

366
00:55:08,164 --> 00:55:09,893
for when the baby arrived.

367
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:17,832
Then I remember being in hospital
with my mother screaming in pain.

368
00:55:19,242 --> 00:55:22,946
And she just give birth,
but the baby was dead.

369
00:55:22,946 --> 00:55:25,471
E. .. was a girl.

370
00:55:27,851 --> 00:55:31,844
And she was dead.
The beating killed her belly.

371
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,826
- Do not laugh at me.
- No, I'm not laughing at you.

372
00:55:36,826 --> 00:55:39,693
I'm not laughing, I just do not know ...

373
00:55:40,196 --> 00:55:42,892
I do not know how it all went through.
Do not even know.

374
00:55:43,233 --> 00:55:44,291
Well ..

375
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:49,270
I do not know. I know this
vai sound horrible, but ...

376
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:54,335
When I was growing up,
I even felt that ...

377
00:55:58,348 --> 00:56:00,942
I did not feel that I was human.

378
00:56:02,552 --> 00:56:04,110
- What?
- You know.

379
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,153
- What is?
- What happened?

380
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,188
What prompted this?

381
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:15,431
I do not know ... Something like ...

382
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:20,434
I was looking out the window and she
told me not to look out the window.

383
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:22,966
And she was ironing and ...

384
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:26,338
She was ironing and ...

385
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:31,414
she came to me and said:
"Do not look out the window.

386
00:56:31,414 --> 00:56:33,575
I told you not to look out the window. "

387
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:39,386
Then I remember
this great iron ...

388
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,290
coming towards me.

389
00:56:42,725 --> 00:56:43,953
How ...

390
00:56:44,828 --> 00:56:46,819
in slow motion ...

391
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:55,865
I do not remember the pain,
just remember this ...

392
00:56:57,407 --> 00:57:00,672
big and loud cry ...

393
00:57:04,914 --> 00:57:05,938
A. ..

394
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:08,817
blood-curdling scream?

395
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,148
It is.

396
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:05,264
- You can not park here.
- Okay.

397
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:53,651
What are you doing?

398
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,156
- Just digging.
- Yeah, whatever. Come.

399
00:58:59,729 --> 00:59:01,856
What Mia said is really true?

400
00:59:04,968 --> 00:59:06,663
Do not be an idiot.

401
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:14,173
On?

402
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:16,202
Yes.

403
00:59:16,913 --> 00:59:21,384
Ok, well ... In the know
at a party a few months ago.

404
00:59:21,384 --> 00:59:25,946
And this other girl had
simply disappeared.

405
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:30,387
Then she moved here and
we are best friends ever since.

406
00:59:34,197 --> 00:59:35,331
Whatever.

407
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:37,526
I think Mia has me
as an example, you know?

408
00:59:40,403 --> 00:59:41,802
Why do you think ...

409
00:59:42,005 --> 00:59:43,336
I mean ...

410
00:59:45,508 --> 00:59:47,408
What are "friends"?

411
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:54,911
"Friends" is the worst type shit
show on TV.

412
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,451
"Hmm .. Why do you think ...
I mean ... "

413
01:00:00,523 --> 01:00:04,254
Like, your questions
are so stupid.

414
01:00:27,016 --> 01:00:30,747
It's scary when
a girl of 6 years ...

415
01:00:32,555 --> 01:00:36,889
sees a lot and knows your heart ...

416
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:40,320
and you do not care for her.

417
01:00:40,697 --> 01:00:44,565
For me, it was just this
disturbed person and ...

418
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:47,996
I could not hate her.

419
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:50,863
Do you know? All I know ...

420
01:00:52,809 --> 01:00:57,940
All I could think was
I had to pity her.

421
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:04,651
Because I know how my father
she was and how she suffered ...

422
01:01:06,222 --> 01:01:09,953
So I could not hate her,
because that was the only way ...

423
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:12,793
Her vent your pain ...

424
01:01:14,363 --> 01:01:16,666
their frustrations, so ...

425
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:20,466
I could handle the shit and
everything else and tried to be strong.

426
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:26,207
And say, "Hey, all right" ...
And just hold on.

427
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:32,710
There were times when I really
I hated my mother.

428
01:01:35,685 --> 01:01:38,813
And I had thoughts of ...
You know ...

429
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,723
I do not mean "kill her"
but just, you know ...

430
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:50,394
push her and say:
"Fuck you."

431
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:56,028
Do you ever think, like ...

432
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,735
perhaps at this point in your life ...

433
01:02:00,743 --> 01:02:05,381
say it, tell her how
feel about all this?

434
01:02:05,381 --> 01:02:06,746
It's too late.

435
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:08,714
It's too late for that, she ...

436
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:13,222
She became, she is
a different person now.

437
01:02:13,222 --> 01:02:15,992
- I do not even know her more.
- But, Mia ...

438
01:02:15,992 --> 01:02:17,260
honestly ...

439
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:22,265
It's like she erased everything and
written in ink on top of Jesus.

440
01:02:22,265 --> 01:02:25,268
I mean, do not you think
would make a difference if you said:

441
01:02:25,268 --> 01:02:26,936
"Look, this is what I think
you did to me ... "

442
01:02:26,936 --> 01:02:28,971
- Know what I mean?
- She would just ignore.

443
01:02:28,971 --> 01:02:31,531
Alright! Lets ignore it.

444
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,776
- Let her ignore.
- She would just ignore.

445
01:02:33,776 --> 01:02:35,004
I'm just saying ...

446
01:02:36,245 --> 01:02:38,679
I'm just saying that I
would want her to know.

447
01:02:38,915 --> 01:02:41,850
I would want to say
I feel for her.

448
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:48,388
She would ignore ...

449
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:25,254
Only coffee.

453
01:03:38,908 -> 01:03:40,000
Thank you.

450
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:12,263
This part will not be seen by
nobody but us three, right?

451
01:04:13,776 --> 01:04:14,944
Sure.

452
01:04:14,944 --> 01:04:17,606
Lie. Lie.

453
01:04:20,216 --> 01:04:21,444
Lie ...

454
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:53,542
BE KIND OR GO AWAY
THANKS

455
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:57,315
NEVER NEVER NEVER
GIVE UP

456
01:05:36,692 --> 01:05:40,856
It's strange that you're so unemotional
when he talks about things like that.

457
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:48,928
Well ..

458
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:54,335
It is because I went through this ...

459
01:05:54,844 --> 01:05:58,302
over and over in my head and ...

460
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:01,907
just ... Do you know?

461
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:09,151
This has disturbed you?

462
01:06:24,573 --> 01:06:26,871
It's like a movie, you know?

463
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:28,870
Yes, I cried.

464
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:33,504
I cried all the tears.
I stayed up all night ...

465
01:06:33,716 --> 01:06:35,479
unable to sleep.

466
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:38,846
I cried until no more tears are left.

467
01:06:41,724 --> 01:06:43,658
From what you cried?

468
01:06:50,232 --> 01:06:52,223
Mostly, for my father.

469
01:06:55,671 --> 01:06:59,334
Because he was the one who
really understood me.

470
01:07:01,277 --> 01:07:02,710
He was the only ...

471
01:07:04,713 --> 01:07:06,271
who knows ...

472
01:07:07,283 --> 01:07:08,875
who loved me.

473
01:07:09,919 --> 01:07:12,183
And it does not hurt me.

474
01:07:12,688 --> 01:07:13,746
E. ..

475
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,259
Do you know?

476
01:07:18,828 --> 01:07:23,822
Although he made
these terrible things ...

477
01:07:25,768 --> 01:07:28,566
he was a person
very curious to me.

478
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:31,533
A very interesting person.

479
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:38,908
He was very intelligent
and very artistic.

480
01:07:44,954 --> 01:07:47,923
And I knew it was
so like him.

481
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:53,193
Nothing like my mother ...

482
01:08:05,574 --> 01:08:07,599
When you're a guy, you ...

483
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:11,145
You see his father in him?

484
01:08:37,006 --> 01:08:38,405
No.

485
01:08:41,443 --> 01:08:42,671
Sorry ...

486
01:09:29,225 --> 01:09:30,759
Ok, but, I mean,
it's just that ...

487
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:32,659
I will not talk about it.

488
01:09:36,432 --> 01:09:37,524
Ok

489
01:09:40,836 --> 01:09:42,303
It's just ...

490
01:09:43,405 --> 01:09:45,703
I do not know who will see it.

491
01:09:47,376 --> 01:09:49,139
If someone is going.

492
01:09:54,383 --> 01:09:56,908
About what you want
talk then?

493
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,548
I do not know.

494
01:10:04,526 --> 01:10:06,585
What do you want to talk?

495
01:10:09,665 --> 01:10:12,657
Let's talk about ...

496
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:15,962
All I knew was ...

497
01:10:16,572 --> 01:10:17,937
it hurt.

498
01:10:18,641 --> 01:10:23,544
And the second time he penetrated me,
and I was crying, it hurt so much.

499
01:10:23,912 --> 01:10:28,474
And I thought: "My God,
it should be pleasurable. "

500
01:10:28,584 --> 01:10:30,452
And that brochou me immediately.

501
01:10:30,452 --> 01:10:34,354
And I looked down and saw
this pool of blood ...

502
01:10:34,556 --> 01:10:36,425
out of the way of my legs.

503
01:10:36,425 --> 01:10:39,292
And I just thought:
"Oh, my God."

504
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:41,292
And his name was Jim and he was ...

505
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:43,521
And I just ...

506
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:45,699
"Oh, my God ...

507
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:49,004
looks like you killed someone
these sheets ".

508
01:10:49,004 --> 01:10:50,835
And he said: "It is ...".

509
01:10:51,473 --> 01:10:54,772
Apparently he really loved me
and asked me to marry.

510
01:10:54,977 --> 01:10:58,547
So of course, I let
immediately by another guy.

511
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:00,014
How old were you?

512
01:11:00,582 --> 01:11:02,209
I was nineteen.

513
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:05,452
You were a virgin with nineteen?

514
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:07,219
Yes.

515
01:11:14,463 --> 01:11:18,194
They say that if you are a virgin
and lose his virginity ...

516
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,370
to his first love,
that after experiencing ...

517
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:24,907
the loss of her virginity,
you just hate that guy ...

518
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:29,778
because you want him back and not
realizes how much he wanted ...

519
01:11:29,778 --> 01:11:32,804
how was precious,
until vai.

520
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:36,979
It did not hurt?

521
01:11:42,725 --> 01:11:44,215
I do not know.

522
01:11:46,729 --> 01:11:47,821
Well ..

523
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:02,806
Well, I think that is quite different
for men.

524
01:12:03,245 --> 01:12:04,473
Do not you think?

525
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:09,451
I mean, I think the same.

526
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:14,411
I think that guy
not feeling your pain.

527
01:12:14,556 --> 01:12:16,258
- No.
- The guy who I was ...

528
01:12:16,258 --> 01:12:18,694
- I did not feel my pain.
- They just think they're earning.

529
01:12:18,694 --> 01:12:21,219
Exactly! He was just
thinking about having sex.

530
01:12:21,397 --> 01:12:23,524
I'll only date women
going forward.

531
01:12:28,237 --> 01:12:30,671
What do you think
attracts the guys who ...

532
01:12:33,409 --> 01:12:35,673
they just want to eat you and you leave?

533
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:37,405
Pardon?

534
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:39,278
I mean ...

535
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:42,206
it is a quality
attractive in a guy?

536
01:12:42,584 --> 01:12:44,211
You search it?

537
01:12:44,586 --> 01:12:45,917
Type someone ...

538
01:12:47,756 --> 01:12:51,317
You look at someone and think:
"He just wants to earn"?

539
01:12:53,429 --> 01:12:56,865
No, I do not think it's attractive.
I find disgusting.

540
01:12:57,733 --> 01:12:59,635
I look for personality in a guy.

541
01:12:59,635 --> 01:13:02,271
- He must have a sense of humor.
- You know, I'd say that ...

542
01:13:02,271 --> 01:13:05,340
I could not care less
on the appearance of a face.

543
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,810
I do not have a type.
Do not care about height.

544
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:10,813
I do not ... As long as they are
taller than me.

545
01:13:10,813 --> 01:13:14,146
I know many guys
they have giant egos.

546
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:17,619
And you know what? I think there
great art in humility.

547
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:19,780
Do not you think, Mia?
I mean ...

548
01:13:20,255 --> 01:13:22,689
There is a great art to be humble.

549
01:13:22,758 --> 01:13:26,319
Even if it's beautiful, even if
be smart, whatever.

550
01:13:26,495 --> 01:13:29,259
Just receive a compliment and say ...

551
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:32,757
"Yeah ...", instead of:
"Yeah, I am too."

552
01:13:33,335 --> 01:13:34,903
I could not do that.

553
01:13:34,903 --> 01:13:36,666
Know what I mean?
You understand me?

554
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:38,563
No, I'm not understanding.

555
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:41,309
You're being totally confused.

556
01:13:42,578 --> 01:13:44,773
No, I'm not.
Mia knows what I'm saying.

557
01:13:45,814 --> 01:13:48,510
Ok Maybe it's a
subtle feminine language.

558
01:13:51,653 --> 01:13:54,223
What we are saying is that
know a lot of guys ...

559
01:13:54,223 --> 01:13:56,384
ok, I'm saying. Ok

560
01:13:56,792 --> 01:13:58,225
Wait a minute.

561
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,526
- Here's what I'm saying.
- What?

562
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,769
I know many guys who
think they are so delicious ...

563
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:09,838
they are the best thing ...
Whatever. Whatever.

564
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:13,375
Perhaps they are beautiful and intelligent,
or maybe smart and beautiful ...

565
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,741
Whatever!
I'm just saying ...

566
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:17,740
I agree.

567
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:19,812
When ...

568
01:14:21,283 --> 01:14:24,620
a person is humble,
a man or a woman ...

569
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:27,389
so this is a very quality
greater than having a huge ego.

570
01:14:27,389 --> 01:14:28,754
Now I make sense?

571
01:14:30,392 --> 01:14:31,450
Ok ..

572
01:14:32,227 --> 01:14:34,286
Let me ask you a question.

573
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:36,965
- Right?
- Yes

574
01:14:36,965 --> 01:14:38,364
Ok, so ...

575
01:14:43,705 --> 01:14:45,434
Ask the question.

576
01:14:47,342 --> 01:14:49,537
Ok So ...

577
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:58,353
If it were to confer
all people ...

578
01:14:58,353 --> 01:15:00,821
- With whom he had intimate ...
- Yes

579
01:15:00,923 --> 01:15:03,653
- In the last five or ten years ...
- Yes

580
01:15:04,393 --> 01:15:06,418
How were their ideals?

581
01:15:07,229 --> 01:15:10,221
How dovetailed
humble in that category?

582
01:15:11,433 --> 01:15:13,628
Well, no, obviously.

583
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:18,734
Because if there was an ideal
I would be with that person.

584
01:15:21,877 --> 01:15:24,573
I do not know how many
people I slept.

585
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:28,980
I'd say something close
two hundred faces.

586
01:15:29,284 --> 01:15:31,445
- Two hundred?
- It is. It is.

587
01:15:34,623 --> 01:15:36,625
Do not worry;
I was safe with them.

588
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:38,752
You know, condoms and everything else.

589
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:40,796
- Rubber gloves.
- Rubber gloves can say.

590
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:42,831
Nonoxynol-9. Whatever.

591
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:46,858
It is at this point two hundred guys
and about three girls.

592
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:49,561
- Three girls?
- It is.

593
01:15:49,738 --> 01:15:51,467
You know everyone's name?

594
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:55,936
You know everyone's name?

595
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:43,492
Man, if they expand, a line
all these chicks together ...

596
01:16:43,492 --> 01:16:45,221
could reach the moon

597
01:16:52,267 --> 01:16:55,168
God is dead and no one cares.

598
01:17:27,703 --> 01:17:29,762
I did not mean anything by it.

599
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:32,203
Just shut up once, ok?

600
01:17:34,743 --> 01:17:36,233
Ok

601
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:41,272
I do not believe
I'm crying ...

602
01:17:49,858 --> 01:17:52,588
I can not even remember
the last time i ...

603
01:17:56,832 --> 01:17:58,459
How do you feel?

604
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:04,434
I feel ...

605
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,308
well.

606
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:08,503
Not so good, but you know ...

607
01:18:10,746 --> 01:18:11,906
Honestly.

608
01:18:20,522 --> 01:18:22,786
It is not good ...

609
01:18:25,393 --> 01:18:26,860
you know ...

610
01:18:27,295 --> 01:18:28,887
just ...

611
01:18:34,269 --> 01:18:36,829
just be myself for a change.

612
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,211
Who are you generally?

613
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,764
Happy Birthday.

614
01:21:34,547 --> 01:21:36,412
Happy Birthday.

615
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,453
Happy Birthday.

616
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:52,463
- Yes?
- John, I love that cat, man.

617
01:21:52,632 --> 01:21:54,156
Yeah, the cat is good.

618
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:56,424
Still to drink?

619
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,865
Should bring
your girls, man.

620
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:02,773
It really was thinking
to invite them to eat.

621
01:22:03,876 --> 01:22:05,070
In order to cook?

622
01:22:38,344 --> 01:22:40,244
I had this ...

623
01:22:40,647 --> 01:22:44,845
amazing story
that should tell tonight ...

624
01:22:46,486 --> 01:22:51,185
- And that should be a part ...
- Mia, think we should go soon?

625
01:22:57,630 --> 01:22:59,621
Just give us the short version.

626
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:11,436
My mother locked me in the basement.

627
01:23:12,078 --> 01:23:14,046
I regained consciousness.

628
01:23:15,081 --> 01:23:16,742
I escaped.

629
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:19,647
I said to everyone: "Get out."

630
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,311
I ran away.

631
01:23:23,656 --> 01:23:25,783
I began my own life.

632
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:32,194
I made many mistakes,
but learned from them.

633
01:23:34,133 --> 01:23:37,830
And now I am a strong
and independent woman.

634
01:23:39,539 --> 01:23:41,734
Mia! We gotta go!

635
01:23:43,242 --> 01:23:45,506
Just do not hate me because I'm beautiful.

636
01:23:46,412 --> 01:23:48,073
I do not hate ...

637
01:23:49,682 --> 01:23:51,673
you just confuses me.

638
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:55,154
Mia!

639
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:56,750
Exciting.

640
01:23:59,292 --> 01:24:00,384
Exciting.

641
01:24:02,628 --> 01:24:05,256
- We gotta go.
- Exciting.

642
01:24:06,165 --> 01:24:07,325
Animal!

643
01:24:09,535 --> 01:24:10,797
Like me.

644
01:24:12,138 --> 01:24:13,503
What is exciting?

645
01:24:16,142 --> 01:24:17,302
Come on!

646
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,645
Come on!

647
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:36,719
Come on.

648
01:24:37,797 --> 01:24:41,198
That is immortalized
on tape forever.

649
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:45,138
We are terrible actresses.

650
01:24:45,138 --> 01:24:48,335
No, we are brilliant actresses!

651
01:25:06,425 --> 01:25:08,461
Ok Good is good enough.

652
01:25:08,461 --> 01:25:11,055
As I give the zoom it, John?

653
01:25:11,164 --> 01:25:12,198
Here ...

654
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:15,656
So much effort and so little
recognition.

655
01:25:16,068 --> 01:25:17,729
That dress is so tight.

656
01:25:19,105 --> 01:25:23,269
- You are getting fatter, Violet?
- It is. My butt is increasing.

657
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:27,372
My body thinks is
pregnant.

658
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:31,309
But it is not, then my
Ass is increasing.

659
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:34,247
You are pregnant in your ass?

660
01:25:35,188 --> 01:25:37,679
- Where the hell are we?
- Suite 623.

661
01:26:26,138 --> 01:26:28,333
Hey, who's the boss
tonight?

662
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:35,081
That's it. Anything else is extra.
In cash.

663
01:26:35,081 --> 01:26:36,241
Who is the groom?

664
01:26:39,285 --> 01:26:41,515
Congratulations, sit there.

665
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:18,385
- No touching.
- Sorry.

666
01:27:33,506 --> 01:27:35,167
I want to put on your tail.

667
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,601
This costs an extra.

668
01:27:45,318 --> 01:27:47,843
- Are you ready?
- Where are you? We're waiting.

669
01:27:48,854 --> 01:27:52,187
- The security kicked me out again.
- Hurry up!

670
01:27:54,393 --> 01:27:55,417
Right.

671
01:28:47,813 --> 01:28:50,509
I think in a strange way
he's jealous of me.

672
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,379
Drive.

673
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:53,503
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

674
01:30:56,876 --> 01:30:58,400
Hi, Lizzy.

675
01:30:59,545 --> 01:31:01,240
Yeah, all right.

676
01:31:03,816 --> 01:31:05,716
Yes, I'm here tomorrow.

677
01:31:07,353 --> 01:31:08,581
Legal.

678
01:31:10,156 --> 01:31:11,589
You too.

679
01:31:12,391 --> 01:31:13,688
Goodbye.

680
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:23,692
I hate the suburbs.

681
01:31:34,914 --> 01:31:36,779
You want to eat?

682
01:31:42,588 --> 01:31:45,182
If the path of a bar.

683
01:32:38,577 --> 01:32:39,812
That dinner of pasta.

684
01:32:39,812 --> 01:32:41,413
- Not good? Not good?
- Spectacular.

685
01:32:41,413 --> 01:32:43,574
- Incredible.
- It's my specialty.

686
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:47,444
- Now let's turn the lens.
- I have a question.

687
01:32:47,886 --> 01:32:50,756
- Yes
- We have some questions, baby.

688
01:32:50,756 --> 01:32:52,223
Right.

689
01:32:52,758 --> 01:32:56,489
- What are friends?
- That are friends.

690
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,255
This is good. I like that.

691
01:32:59,431 --> 01:33:01,058
Why do not you talk more?

692
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:04,267
Good question.

693
01:33:05,304 --> 01:33:07,139
And it was a great answer.

694
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:09,039
You outweigh me.

695
01:33:10,776 --> 01:33:13,404
There are just a number
it works.

696
01:33:15,581 --> 01:33:19,017
This is the potential John.

697
01:33:19,285 --> 01:33:21,048
What is this shit?

698
01:33:21,353 --> 01:33:25,551
My God!
It's like, it's like ...

699
01:33:25,758 --> 01:33:29,828
I mean, sleep on it.

700
01:33:29,828 --> 01:33:32,398
- She found her place.
- No, I thought not.

701
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:36,391
See it. See it.
The notes of John ...

702
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:40,172
All ten!
All ten, look at that guy!

703
01:33:40,172 --> 01:33:41,740
I knew he was smart.

704
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:43,503
Why do you guard that?

705
01:33:43,676 --> 01:33:45,268
- Why do I keep it?
- It is.

706
01:33:46,278 --> 01:33:47,438
To remember?

707
01:33:47,613 --> 01:33:51,242
This is my zenith.
That's where I ...

708
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:55,477
We take a close
photo of before and after?

709
01:33:55,654 --> 01:33:56,643
My God.

710
01:33:56,889 --> 01:33:58,624
After a haircut.

711
01:33:58,624 --> 01:34:01,149
- Begins as a progression ...
- Can you catch?

712
01:34:02,061 --> 01:34:05,230
See it. See it!
This guy just took off in December

713
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:06,432
Can you see it?

714
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:09,367
- What? What?
- How are you?

715
01:34:09,635 --> 01:34:12,695
- You went through my things?
- No, it did not move!

716
01:34:14,206 --> 01:34:17,232
I'm glad that John and I are
finally coming together ...

717
01:34:18,177 --> 01:34:20,407
because he is my friend
and my cousin ...

718
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:23,381
- How's the job search going?
- He's cool.

719
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:26,118
- What do you do?
- The job search?

720
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:27,415
Yeah, how's it going?

721
01:34:28,754 --> 01:34:31,423
- How do I do?
- I'm sure you know.

722
01:34:31,423 --> 01:34:34,221
- Oh, I know.
- Do not just take.

723
01:34:34,793 --> 01:34:37,057
Just get! Do nothing more.

724
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:39,290
She is bossy.

725
01:34:42,368 --> 01:34:46,168
- Who is your favorite?
- You are.

726
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:53,846
See, that's why I forgot.
Lost our first kiss ...

727
01:34:53,846 --> 01:34:55,313
and I felt bad.

728
01:34:56,448 --> 01:34:58,712
And I know what happened, but I forgot.

729
01:34:59,585 --> 01:35:03,351
- He's the luckiest guy
- He's the luckiest guy

730
01:35:03,522 --> 01:35:05,114
He's the luckiest guy

731
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:10,129
- He's the luckiest guy
- He's the luckiest guy

732
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:13,394
- In the Lower East Side
- In the Lower East Side

733
01:35:13,565 --> 01:35:17,469
Because it has wheels
And we want to take a ride

734
01:35:17,469 --> 01:35:20,131
- I screwed. I'm so bad.
- You spoiled.

735
01:35:21,774 --> 01:35:23,765
- Come here, baby.
- Go on, buddy.

736
01:35:24,076 --> 01:35:26,544
- I will prepare for you.
- Best seat in the house.

737
01:35:27,146 --> 01:35:28,340
You deserved it.

738
01:35:28,781 --> 01:35:32,851
- He's the luckiest guy
- He's the luckiest guy

739
01:35:32,851 --> 01:35:36,287
- In the Lower East Side
- In the Lower East Side

740
01:35:37,122 --> 01:35:41,149
Because it has wheels
And we want to take a ride

741
01:35:45,063 --> 01:35:48,834
- He's the luckiest guy
- He's the luckiest guy

742
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:52,634
- In the Lower East Side
- In the Lower East Side

743
01:35:52,838 --> 01:35:57,741
Because it has wheels
And we want to take a ride

744
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:00,774
- Where's the cat?
- Where's the cat?
