Director K.C. Park

7
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,846
Good night, Miss Lee

8
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,923
- Good day
- Thank you

9
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,216
- Are you closed?
- Yes

10
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,120
Is it raining?

11
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,136
- Are you here for a cut?
- Yes

12
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,365
So sorry.
Come back tomorrow?

13
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,008
Wait. Wait a sec

14
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,523
Give me a reason why you need
your hair cut today and I'll do it

15
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,997
A reason?

16
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,100
Yes, Mr. Ji-suk Kang!

17
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,796
Um, how do you know my name?

18
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,868
Don't you know me?

19
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,771
Well

20
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,042
Shall we play a game?

21
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,721
Remember who I am before I'm done
and the haircut's on me

22
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:54,625
But if you can't remember,
then you pay me double

23
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,806
Are you always like this?

24
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,875
It's a game.
What, no questions?

25
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,425
- Okay, you're done
- Thank you

26
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,060
Don't you want a hint?

27
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,701
A beautiful woman knows my name

28
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,669
Aren't you even curious?

29
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,608
No

30
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,640
I think I've won

31
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,179
Dong-beak Junior High,
ninth grade, Hee-jin Park

32
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,115
Wrong!

33
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,385
Not Hee-jin Park.
It's Hee-jin Lee!

34
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:31,521
Madeleine

35
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,779
Guess who I met today

36
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,616
Quiet, I'll lose count

37
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,990
Our class president in 9th grade

38
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,386
He looks like a total goodie.
But with some work here and there

39
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,455
he'll be decent boyfriend material

40
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,830
- Looking to get dumped again?
- What!

41
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,471
Joon-ho Kim

42
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,915
Hee-jin Lee

43
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,247
What do you mean, dumped?

44
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,907
I dumped him

45
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,074
Oh, yeah?

46
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,382
It might start raining again
so get out your raincoats

47
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,290
Ji-suk, good work!

48
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,788
Gyu-hee!

49
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,855
You missed 36-13 yesterday!
Don't forget it today!

50
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,358
Man-ho! Good morning

51
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,422
Hey, Mr. Writer

52
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,930
- Good weekend?
- Yeah

53
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,798
Should we get our coffee?

54
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,533
Hmm, sounds good

55
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,275
What'd you make in class today?

56
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,508
For our teatime pleasure today

57
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,875
Sweet rolls!

58
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,214
Looks good, Man-ho

59
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,527
Thanks

60
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,799
This is really good

61
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,735
How many stars today?

62
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,242
Out of five stars four and a half

63
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,092
Ji-suk Kang!

64
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,524
- Hee-jin!
- That's right, dude

65
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,136
- Where are you headed?
- School

66
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,966
Huh? You haven't re-enrolled yet

67
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,837
I'm going to the library

68
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,207
No girlfriend, huh?

69
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,512
Why else would you go there
on such a beautiful spring day?

70
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,742
Still, there are a lot of
single girls there

71
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,386
Hey! Give me your cell phone

72
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,790
Whoa, what an antique!

73
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,329
Can you even send text messages?

74
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,468
No numbers saved?

75
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,407
I don't use it much

76
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,010
Well, what an honor,
I'm number one

77
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,039
I'll show you how to do it

78
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,451
- You press this
- Miss Lee

79
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,111
And then save

80
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,714
Hey, she's calling you

81
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,293
Yep, well, see you next time!

82
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,038
Hello?

83
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,510
- Hello?
- Hello?

84
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,778
Hee-jin, it's me. I got us
a blind date off the internet

85
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:05,447
Again? Did you get fired? You work
at an internet cafe now, don't you?

86
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,460
Hey, don't be mean. Get dressed up
after work and wait for me

87
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,427
- Oh! No!
- Love you!

88
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,022
Hey!

89
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,340
Um, excuse me Uh

90
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,071
Do you have something to say?

91
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,074
No

92
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,523
'Please dine with me tonight.
Woo-jin Choi'

93
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,471
Damn, what a bust!

94
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,564
Cheer up

95
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,506
Did you think you'd meet
Prince Charming on a blind date?

96
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,772
I was crazy to go with you.
Plain crazy!

97
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:17,386
Treating me like that,
they suck! Ugh!

98
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,057
You know,
they so weren't my type

99
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,128
Shit!

100
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,499
Hey, in your mood,
you'd kill at Fortress

101
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,604
Let's go play a game

102
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,500
Do you know what time it is?

103
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,000
Tomorrow's my day off

104
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,378
Let's go, let's play

105
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,579
Do you think I'm off, too?
No, I'm going home to sleep

106
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,320
Come on

107
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,420
You lonely?
Want me to set you up?

108
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,998
Hey, set me up with someone

109
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,531
You have your little honey

110
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,559
Nah, she thinks

111
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,162
keeping her virginity is
God's will or something

112
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,633
Know why her name's Yae-eun?

113
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,613
'Yae' is from 'yae-soo' (Jesus)

114
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,411
'Eun' is from 'eun-hae' (blessing)

115
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,089
Get it? Jesus' blessing.
So what chance do I have?

116
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,919
And I've invested too much
to dump her now

117
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,964
I think I need a sex partner

118
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,037
Bastard

119
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,208
Hey! Ji-suk!

120
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,450
What are you doing here?

121
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,419
As you can see

122
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,119
You are weird

123
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,296
Wow!

124
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,536
This is for the coffee!

125
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,040
This is the best coffee
vending machine around here

126
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,015
Wow, it's really good

127
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,452
I'm so strange. I just can't pass up
coffee from a vending machine

128
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,584
Standing in the street,
drinking coffee like this

129
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,761
I feel so elegant, I love it

130
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,489
Watcha doing later?

131
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,233
I'll probably be at the library

132
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,962
The library again!

133
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,130
I'm off today

134
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,942
Let's go somewhere and play

135
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,072
Where?

136
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,114
Where ever. You decide

137
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,007
Hey, Ji-suk!

138
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,476
Hey, you're here

139
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,785
You love me, don't you?

140
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,892
You must love me
to wait 40 minutes

141
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,366
Then you must hate me

142
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,300
to be 40 minutes late

143
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,635
No, I'm usually an hour late
for the first date

144
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,005
I'm actually 20 minutes early

145
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,975
Let's go

146
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,354
This is where
you chose for our date?

147
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,649
Why not? It's nice

148
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,722
With lots of vending
machines around

149
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,864
Ooh, f-e-e-I that sun!

150
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,703
I love the sky!

151
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,845
It's never boring

152
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,846
When I don't want to see it,
I don't have to

153
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,511
And when I want to,
I can see it from anywhere

154
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,688
You really do love me, don't you?

155
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,390
You smile at whatever I say!

156
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,081
Mr. Author!

157
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,414
Did you read all these?

158
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,847
I'm working on it

159
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,291
You're so weird

160
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:53,054
Why do you want to
write books?

161
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:58,301
No one reads books nowadays.
None of my friends read books!

162
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,504
That's an error from
over-generalizing

163
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,633
Over-general what?

164
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,172
Just because your friends
don't read

165
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,178
doesn't mean
the whole world doesn't

166
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,376
Right, you're so smart

167
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,083
I don't know much about
over-whatever

168
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,921
but I know too well how to scrimp
to make ends meet

169
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,859
You haven't tasted the bitterness
of society yet but

170
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,334
Give me one of
your thickest books

171
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,977
Very good! Me likes it

172
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,411
I'll lend it to you.
Give it a try

173
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,121
See! It's the perfect pillow!

174
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,655
That book is sort of
a milestone for me

175
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,359
After ending army duty

176
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,666
I vowed not to cut my hair
till I read 100 books

177
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,935
Then when you came to the salon?

178
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,339
That's the 100th book

179
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,512
Wow, we have something in common

180
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,985
My goal's to fill up my phone
with 100 boy names

181
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,315
- Let's go!
- Where to?

182
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,424
To commemorate our date!

183
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,084
Another year, another birthday

184
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,165
let's all congratulate Ji-suk

185
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,699
All together now, happy birthday!

186
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,966
Happy birthday to you!

187
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,236
Happy birthday to you!

188
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,642
Happy birthday to you!

189
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,875
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

190
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,780
Happy birthday to you!

191
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,752
Congratulations!

192
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,319
Hey, is this a dinner show?

193
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,989
Fun, huh?

194
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,266
Yeah, lots

195
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,767
So what if
it's not your birthday

196
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,235
Think of it
as congrats on our date

197
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:25,108
Do you know how many papers
I need to deliver to pay for all this?

198
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:28,145
Is this the bitterness of society?

199
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:35,958
Ji-suk when you write, do you
calculate how much each word costs?

200
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,223
10 cents, 20 cents, 30 cents

201
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,662
Eat up

202
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,041
So you got
what you dreamed of

203
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:02,611
Hair designer.
Wasn't that your dream from 9th grade?

204
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,847
Huh! You remember that?

205
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,719
I don't think any of
our classmates could forget

206
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,393
Will you look at this?

207
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,770
Are you wearing mousse to school?

208
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,607
Hee-jin Lee!

209
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:26,309
If you're like this now,
how are you going to turn out later?

210
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,312
Do you want to end up
a bar hostess?

211
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,180
I'm going to be
a hair designer

212
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,547
A hair designer?

213
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,646
Ji-suk!

214
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,489
Do you think her hair's pretty?

215
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,668
Um it's pretty

216
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,642
What did you say?

217
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,138
Is that pretty to you?

218
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,215
Ji-suk!

219
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:08,182
You're the class president!
No wonder this class is in the dumps!

220
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,322
Did you start right
after high school?

221
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,485
Nope, since 11th grade

222
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:19,093
Wow, you're quick at everything

223
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:23,993
It's cause I'm simple.
I do it cause I like it. Simple!

224
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,707
Why did you get a job
delivering papers of all jobs?

225
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,199
I do it cause I like it, too

226
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,769
Delivering papers at dawn

227
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,243
it's like taking a walk
in an empty city

228
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,766
Hee-jin!

229
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,234
I wanted to take a walk
at dawn too

230
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,482
33-90, that's the house number,
R-alley, R-swing is

231
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,512
- Past the right alley
- Oh, past the alley, swing right?

232
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:15,985
Yep

233
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:20,014
So L-swing, R-1 means
swing left, first house on the right?

234
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,092
Wow, you catch on fast

235
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,684
It's easy

236
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,457
Let's start!

237
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,158
Let's go!

238
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,135
Okay, here you go

239
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,954
- Hey, Mr. Writer!
- Good morning

240
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,752
- Are you quitting your route?
- Huh?

241
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,759
Oh, no, she's my friend

242
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:37,095
- Hello!
- Hello. How do you do?

243
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,770
She's pretty

244
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,734
No wonder I wanted to pack
some extra today

245
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,313
What's today's menu?

246
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,179
Today, it's um

247
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:57,213
Let's have some milk

248
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,223
- Thank you
- Do you have strawberry milk?

249
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,692
Strawberry? Um yes

250
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,162
- Here you go
- Thank you

251
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,897
Ah madeleines!
Today's madeleines

252
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,173
Ah so these are madeleines?

253
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,737
Have you had
madeleines before?

254
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,344
No

255
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,307
In Remembrance of
Things Past

256
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,809
the book starts with the character
recalling a childhood memory

257
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,949
The thing sparking his memory
is the madeleine

258
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,456
Why?

259
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,018
He eats a madeleine
by chance

260
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,291
and remembers
the taste which triggers

261
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,629
other forgotten
childhood memories

262
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,898
Here

263
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,440
Mmm, it's good!

264
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,134
Five stars

265
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,739
So do you remember anything?

266
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,843
This is my first time

267
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,857
Maybe, in 10 years

268
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:10,559
I'll eat a madeleine by chance
and I'll remember today

269
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,649
Ji-suk Kang!

270
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,816
What?

271
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,258
Shall I make today
unforgettable for all time?

272
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,388
How?

273
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,863
Let's date!

274
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,099
What?

275
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,266
Let's have a romance!

276
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:02,510
We don't know
each other very well

277
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,343
Did I say for us
to get hitched?

278
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,317
We date,
to we get to know each other!

279
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,188
Why? Don't you like me?

280
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,224
- It's not that
- Then what?

281
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,523
Give me some time
to think about it!

282
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,992
Fine!

283
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,567
I'll give you
till we get home!

284
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,147
Go on in

285
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,885
How about it?

286
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,127
What do you say?
About our romance

287
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:59,664
Um, well It's um

288
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:07,273
It may be easy
for you to decide

289
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,538
- But this is very hard for me
- Stop!

290
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,816
If it's too much for you

291
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,918
then let's just go out
for a month

292
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,826
What?

293
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,920
An arranged romance
for just a month

294
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,693
Watcha think? Fun, huh?

295
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:48,612
The conditions are
we have to be 100% honest!

296
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:53,720
We can't say let's break up
until the month is up

297
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,389
After a month,
we part ways grandly!

298
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,295
You do whatever you want,
don't you?

299
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,130
But poor you

300
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:12,104
After a month,
you'll be in love with me

301
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,078
Then what happens?

302
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,140
Then? Well, say that
you love me

303
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,520
I shall consider it then

304
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,069
Hey, is it supposed to
sting so much?

305
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,164
My scalp feels like
it's on fire

306
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:47,937
Wussy you know what we call hair
that's never been permed or colored?

307
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,047
What?

308
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,773
Virgin hair

309
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:57,755
Ji-suk, the first time's
always a little painful

310
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,662
How come a guy like you,
who can't make a decision

311
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:15,301
said 'yes' to our month romance?

312
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,807
here are some moments
I want to share with you

313
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,348
Really?

314
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,252
What kind of moments
do you want to share with me?

315
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,918
Well, you see, it's

316
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:56,109
So what you want to share with me,
it's to go biking in the rain?

317
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,044
Isn't it romantic?

318
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,716
Please don't write a love story

319
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,986
I'm writing one right now

320
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,613
Well, take this scene out

321
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:16,620
Ji-suk, why do like
getting wet in the rain?

322
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,138
In the rain, I feel like
I'm getting cleansed

323
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:39,277
You do know
that it's acid rain

324
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,223
That's why
we're wearing raincoats

325
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:06,507
Ji-suk, you wanna
go to my place?

326
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,082
Hey! This is really good

327
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,549
My mom likes tea
more than sex

328
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,092
I've inherited
her talent with tea

329
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,285
I think I'm going to like tea

330
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,193
more than s-sex
from now on

331
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,325
Liar

332
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,266
It's really good

333
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:06,928
Not that

334
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,764
Have you even had sex?

335
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,136
No, right?

336
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:21,950
Hey, at my age,
of course I have

337
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,681
Really? With who?

338
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:31,385
Well, um

339
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:35,329
Ji-suk Kang,
you're so cute

340
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,769
The moments we shared today,
I was really happy!

341
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,251
Even when I'm older,
a grandma

342
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:57,246
every time I drink this tea,
I think I'll remember today

343
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,694
This way, my memory
will be more vivid

344
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,045
- They'll break!
- No, they won't!

345
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,313
Don't talk when
I'm doing the dishes

346
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,549
I can't concentrate on,
so I might break them

347
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,482
You know, you're pretty good
with dishes

348
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:38,653
Yeah? Well, of course. I've lived
alone for years. Dishes are a given

349
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:41,460
Yeah? You can do
laundry as well?

350
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,524
- Laundry?
- I have lots of laundry

351
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,933
laundry? I can't do it well

352
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,305
- Are you good with dishes?
- Of course

353
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:30,339
Hey! Don't you feel like
this is a waste of time?

354
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:34,277
Nope! Doesn't it just
clear your head?

355
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,649
Play another game!

356
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,780
Any questions,
just ask me, the master

357
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,719
Hi! It's Sung-hae, remember me?
We were in the same class, 9th grade

358
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:17,128
Wanna catch up? Come to Blue Moon,
Sat. At 7. You can catch me there

359
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:46,250
What I wish for is
your blue ocean

360
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:59,436
The universe inside those pearls
I cannot see anymore

361
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:10,004
I lose sleep, I'm so tired

362
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:16,850
The energy inside me
Fading, fading

363
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:25,494
As I wait quietly
Finally, blue eyes

364
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:36,064
I lose sleep, I'm so tired

365
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:42,443
The energy inside me
Fading, fading

366
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:49,009
I lose sleep, I'm so tired.

367
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:55,424
The energy inside me
Fading, fading

368
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:21,374
I lose sleep, I'm so tired

369
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:28,824
The energy inside me
Fading, fading

370
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,926
Hee-jin Lee,
what are you doing?

371
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,036
Aren't you meeting
Ji-suk today?

372
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:43,972
Shhh, mommy's reading

373
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,902
Be quiet, please

374
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,319
- You major in film?
- Uh-huh

375
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,855
Bye. See you tomorrow

376
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,832
- See ya!
- Uh-huh

377
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,402
A film major and
lead vocals in a band

378
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,435
Wow that's a busy life

379
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:51,938
There were 3 things
I always wanted to do in college

380
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:55,806
Love, travel, and the leader
of a rock-n-roll band!

381
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,471
Then you've done all three?

382
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,642
Of course!

383
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,316
Oh, there's a class
reunion this Sat

384
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,016
Reunion?

385
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,856
Just some classmates living in Seoul.
You want to come?

386
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,207
Do you have a girlfriend?

387
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,707
Uh, uh, no

388
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,580
Hello?

389
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,517
It's me

390
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,492
Oh, Hee-jin

391
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:49,259
Yeah. Ji-suk, I read 100 pages
of Moon Palace today

392
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,665
Oh Really?

393
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:56,335
At this rate, I'll finish it before
our month is up, don't you think?

394
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,207
Probably

395
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,173
Probably?

396
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:03,446
How come you're
so wishy-washy, huh?

397
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:14,554
One time, Jong-chul, man,
he was at my house to watch porn

398
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,991
Suddenly, my mom walked in

399
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,086
Wow, we were screwed,
you know!

400
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:22,166
We tried to get the tape out
but it was stuck

401
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,494
So then what happened?

402
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,398
We took the whole player out

403
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:28,631
Told his mom, we had to copy
an English tape or something

404
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:41,514
Hey! You're really a hair designer?
Not a washer?

405
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:44,087
If I were still a washer,
I'd die!

406
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:48,023
That's impressive!

407
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,583
You're the only one still doing what
we dreamed of doing in school

408
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:56,062
Oh, my!
I must be the last one

409
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,331
- Hey, Mi-hee!
- It's so good to see you, girl!

410
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:04,899
I'm so heavy
it's hard to get around

411
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:06,433
What's a mommy doing here?

412
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,412
Min-chul, you be quiet!

413
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,208
But what's this?

414
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,483
Oh, it's Sung-hae's birthday today!

415
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:16,110
Whoa, Sung-hae's birthday?

416
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,921
Happy birthday to you!

417
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,754
Happy birthday to you!

418
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:28,662
Happy birthday, dear Sung-hae!
Happy birthday to you!

419
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,636
I dedicate this song
to my friends

420
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:43,212
who remembered my birthday

421
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:05,864
You're still in my heart

422
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:16,269
When it rains,
the rain covers, hides me

423
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:37,933
The times we spent
together pass

424
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:47,033
You go one without
remembering me

425
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:59,421
Oh, time passes,
without a word from you

426
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:10,968
Even when forever comes,
you still don't know me

427
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:26,373
Yeah. So what if it's Pusan
or that it's between other acts?

428
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,384
We can't be too picky

429
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:35,518
Anyway, Pusan's my hometown

430
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,092
Alright, so we're taking the gig

431
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,497
I'll call you later. Bye

432
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,791
Uh-huh

433
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,866
- Sung-hae!
- Huh?

434
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:55,408
- Happy birthday
- Thanks

435
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,537
Come by the salon sometime

436
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:00,277
I'll cut your hair real nice
for your present

437
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,047
- Really?
- Of course

438
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,883
Come to our gatherings
from now on

439
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:09,120
Bring your boyfriend too.
Okay?

440
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,590
Okay

441
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:14,789
Oh, yeah. You came with Ji-suk, right?
He told you about tonight?

442
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,432
Yeah

443
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:21,865
- So is it true he doesn't have a girlfriend?
- What?

444
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:30,177
Hey, how would I know?

445
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,707
Why?

446
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,946
Did he say he didn't?

447
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:40,046
Well, that's what he said.
But I think he has one

448
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,592
Hey, I really can't dance!

449
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,567
Whatever, it's easy,
just move

450
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,298
Yeah, stop being such
a goodie goodie

451
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,966
Go on! Get up!

452
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,512
Hey, sit, sit, here!

453
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,797
Don't they look
peachy together?

454
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:27,902
Actually, Sung-hae liked
Ji-suk back in junior high

455
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:34,211
That girl,
she's so cool now

456
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:37,042
But she was too shy to
tell him back then

457
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:53,860
Sung-hae has really blossomed

458
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,492
She used to
be a real geek

459
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,504
I always thought
she was pretty

460
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,798
Did you like her back then?

461
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:11,574
Hey, everyone thought I was
a goodie goodie, remember?

462
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,650
A goodie goodie is also a guy

463
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,653
We promised to
be 100% honest

464
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,657
Uh-huh

465
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:28,126
I may not be able to forgive ugliness
but I can forgive a past

466
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,294
It's okay, tell me

467
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:48,013
Um, when Sung-hae had her appendix
taken out and missed school

468
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:54,080
being the class president,
I did lend her my notes

469
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,348
Ji-suk, what are you reading?

470
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,586
Wanna borrow it?

471
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,449
When you're done

472
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,717
I'd really appreciate your notes!

473
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:54,635
That was my first kiss

474
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,520
I wasn't sure

475
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:09,187
Nope, I was even gonna
let it go

476
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,894
But honestly,
I'm really bummed out

477
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:17,359
Because Sung-hae
was my first love?

478
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,933
It just hit me

479
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,167
I'm a woman who
can't help myself

480
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,769
And you have no clue
about women

481
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,677
Are you mad?

482
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,986
You know, life's a bitch

483
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:42,488
See you

484
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:47,394
100% honesty, right?
