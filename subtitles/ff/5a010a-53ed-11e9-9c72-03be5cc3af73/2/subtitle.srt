1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:04,551
100% honesty, right?

2
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:08,690
Shouldn't you at least tell me
why you're mad?

3
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:13,152
Why'd you tell Sung-hae
you don't have a girlfriend?

4
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:20,061
Meet 1000 guys
and they're all the same

5
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,735
One and the same

6
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,754
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Excuse me?

7
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,885
Boyfriend, do you have one?

8
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:17,793
Yes, but we fought yesterday

9
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,260
Really? Why?

10
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:23,166
My love for him is like
a watermelon

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,698
but his love for me
is like an apple

12
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:27,898
So that's why we fought

13
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:31,734
Still, I think apples taste better

14
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,682
Hee-jin's sooo lucky

15
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:33,190
- What's that?
- Ji-suk sent it express

16
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,472
Is it Ji-suk's?

17
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,807
We didn't even do it

18
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,080
Then Jun-ho?

19
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,319
Did you tell Jun-ho?

20
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,219
Are you crazy?

21
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:12,465
He's so simple,
I just know what he's gonna say

22
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:17,373
Why am I always like this?

23
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,673
Let's go to the hospital.
And then forget about it

24
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:24,407
It's really easy for
you to say

25
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,449
I'm not saying it lightly

26
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,212
The more you think,
the harder it is

27
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:31,277
Think of it as
stepping on poop

28
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,487
What? Poop?

29
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:37,985
Is getting pregnant
stepping on poop?

30
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:40,487
Why are you getting mad at me?

31
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:43,533
It's what you said!
Stepping on poop!

32
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,262
So my baby's poop?

33
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:48,901
Is that a thing to say
to a pregnant friend?

34
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:51,736
Hee-jin Lee!
What is your problem?

35
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,638
That's not what I meant

36
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,473
Sure it wasn't

37
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:00,340
Then again,
you never had a boyfriend

38
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:03,009
What would you know
about being pregnant?

39
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:07,948
Well, as I live and breathe!

40
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:12,259
So you're pretty,
you get all the guys!

41
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:15,464
What am I? A dog?

42
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,968
It's bad enough
I don't have a guy!

43
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,827
On days you bring
a guy home

44
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,306
I can't even go inside

45
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:27,569
Do I have anywhere to go?

46
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,770
So I end up
at a game room

47
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,609
Did you ever think of me
sitting there killing time?

48
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:36,252
Did you?

49
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:51,287
Asters mean
'Don't be mad anymore' Ji-suk

50
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,876
Have you heard
from Hee-jin yet?

51
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,246
Not yet

52
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:12,614
What did I tell you?

53
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:15,241
A cake's better than flowers

54
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:20,116
If I only knew, I would have
made a real pretty cake for you

55
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,248
Too bad

56
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,773
Shall we go to a movie tomorrow?
Hee-jin

57
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,308
It's Hee-jin

58
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,649
She wants to go to
a movie tomorrow

59
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,117
Flowers are okay, too

60
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,479
We're done for today

61
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:19,139
I always came at this time

62
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,647
You want me back, right?

63
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,625
Yoo-jung called today

64
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,528
Said to go see you

65
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,266
If you want

66
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,199
we can hook up again

67
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:46,400
Jun-ho Kim,
that's your problem!

68
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,302
Just cause some
silly girls dig you

69
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,614
it doesn't mean
all women want you

70
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,582
You know
what that's called?

71
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,385
An error from
over-generalizing

72
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,649
Are you okay?

73
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:06,455
If I had an ounce of love left for you
I wouldn't have left you!

74
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,888
How do you want it?

75
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:14,296
Erase my name
from your phone

76
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:40,128
You're only 10 minutes
late today

77
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,027
Did you get the tickets?

78
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:44,559
Let's go

79
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,824
I'm going home tomorrow

80
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,323
I took some time off

81
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,159
To Pusan?

82
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,403
You're still mad, aren't you?

83
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,138
Okay

84
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,015
when I read Sung-hae's mail,
I got a little excited

85
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,350
So when she asked me,
I told her

86
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,321
I didn't have a girlfriend

87
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,760
I know we promised to
be 100% honest

88
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,458
but I felt so bad
I couldn't tell you

89
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:43,380
It's okay, dude

90
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,691
Thanks

91
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,894
I have something to tell you too

92
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:04,970
What?

93
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,274
Ji-suk, I'm pregnant

94
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,257
What Ji-suk Kang likes

95
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:03,664
Reading, taking walks, thinking for
l-o-o-o-ng periods of time

96
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,558
What Hee-jin Lee likes

97
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:10,700
Computer games, shopping

98
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,201
changing hairstyles

99
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,371
We are so different

100
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,576
Why are we going out?

101
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,712
Let's just forget our deal

102
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,829
We can't say 'Let's break up'
before the month is up

103
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,078
I've been wanting to
see the ocean

104
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:01,421
We'll go together Pusan

105
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,669
What about your paper route?

106
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,106
I told them to suspend
the papers tomorrow

107
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,772
Is that supposed to be a joke?

108
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,414
Why, was it bad?

109
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,520
Why are you so good to me?

110
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:37,688
Why? Because
you're my girlfriend

111
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:41,523
Of course,
I'm good to you

112
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:53,474
How many days
are left in our month?

113
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,175
Ji-suk Kang!

114
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,444
Hee-jin!

115
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,283
What are you two doing?

116
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,152
Are you guys going out?

117
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,857
8 across, 7 letters

118
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,491
made by Orson Wells
director of Citizen Kane

119
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:23,595
B&W film based on one of
Shakespeare's 4 great tragedies

120
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:26,041
- Othello
- Correct

121
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,043
9 down, 13 letters

122
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:35,083
road movie with Susan Sarandon
and Geena Davis

123
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,244
- Thelma & Louise
- Correct

124
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:43,923
What exactly is a road movie?

125
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,518
- Oh, that's when
- The characters leave home on a trip

126
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:50,657
and the movie is about
what happens

127
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,494
I'm a film major after all!

128
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,933
Do you know the director
Wim Wenders?

129
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:00,673
I've heard of him but
I haven't seen any of his films

130
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,403
He's my favorite director.
He makes a lot of road movies

131
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:07,215
Ji-suk, see any of his films?

132
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,413
I like Wenders' films too

133
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:12,815
Yeah? Did you see
Paris, Texas?

134
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,919
I liked it so much
I saw it twice

135
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,284
Ry Cooder's music
was really good too

136
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:22,327
Yeah, nothing beats
an acoustic guitar

137
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:26,093
to show the desolate,
lonely desert

138
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,794
Ji-suk, you and I think alike

139
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,804
Wenders really likes
Polaroid cameras

140
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:41,606
So I bought one too

141
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:45,244
I'll take your picture
so strike a pose you two

142
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,214
One two three

143
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,832
This is the one and
only copy of this picture

144
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,627
Who wants it?

145
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,152
I get on the bus across the street.
What about you two?

146
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,513
- The subway
- Oh, yeah?

147
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,251
Well, it's good-bye then.
Get home safe

148
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,522
Remember, the concert's
tomorrow at 7

149
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,229
You both gotta come! Okay?

150
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,960
Saving 100 boy names
on your phone

151
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,459
Why do you want to do that?

152
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,732
When I first started at the salon

153
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,736
I worked from morning to night
with hardly any days off

154
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,207
I had no time to eat or poop

155
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,211
That's how I got to
where I am today

156
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,955
One day, I looked around
and no one was there

157
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:29,788
I felt like crap

158
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,286
I had no name
to save on my phone

159
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,767
After you fill it up,
what are you going to do?

160
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,802
I don't know.
Maybe change phones?

161
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,707
I used to come here a lot
when I was in school

162
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,408
Yo, goodie goodie,
you ever hang out here?

163
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,324
It seems like
yesterday but now

164
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,356
I'm already 25

165
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,259
I'm not ready to
be an adult yet

166
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,967
You can take your time

167
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,408
By the time we die

168
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:22,972
people will being living till 125

169
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:25,842
So we still have
100 years to go

170
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,843
Ah, so that's why
you're so relaxed

171
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:35,249
I want to live like
I'm taking a walk

172
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,348
feeling every moment 100%

173
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:41,056
I want to run like
in a 100m dash

174
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,824
We really have
nothing in common

175
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,135
I remember the day
we biked in the rain

176
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,243
Shall we go get wet?

177
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,109
You're the one who said
it's acid rain

178
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:08,249
Let's go!

179
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,637
You want something
warm to drink?

180
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:41,579
Oh no, that's okay

181
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,194
Are you okay?

182
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,899
Read to me

183
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,314
Where'd you read up to?

184
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,554
Just read from the beginning

185
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,958
Okay, here I go

186
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:09,697
It was the summer that
men first walked on the moon

187
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,603
I was very young back then

188
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,601
but I did not believe
there would ever be a future

189
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:21,739
I wanted to live dangerously

190
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:26,181
to push myself as far as I could go
and when I got there

191
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:04,725
You have gook in your eyes

192
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,760
Hee-jin

193
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:18,603
When are you gonna to go
to the hospital?

194
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,639
As soon as I get to Seoul

195
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:27,006
Let's go together

196
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:41,529
Meet you at 2 tomorrow
at Pusan Station

197
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,965
Mi-hee told me that

198
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,903
in junior high,
Sung-hae liked you too

199
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:47,988
Inside never-ending memories

200
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:56,701
All that I have left disappears

201
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,873
I won't hide anymore

202
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:12,949
What I have left is no more

203
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,489
I'm sorry, Doctor

204
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:26,063
No matter how much time goes by

205
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:32,436
No matter how much time goes by

206
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:40,544
When morning comes,
everything's gone with the night

207
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:46,211
No matter how much time goes by

208
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:55,854
In another beginning
in another beginning

209
00:26:55,964 --> 00:27:04,770
Like a dream,
you come back to me

210
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,037
Do you play 'Fortress?'

211
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,873
No, isn't it a waste to spend
our youth on stuff like that?

212
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:51,919
I started cause
Hee-jin taught me

213
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,185
It's actually fun!

214
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:56,518
I haven't won yet but

215
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,025
It's probably cause
you're a pacifist

216
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,597
You didn't go home yesterday,
did you?

217
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,363
Home?

218
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,407
You're dressed
in the same clothes

219
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,242
That means you were
with Hee-jin

220
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:18,871
Why'd you come alone?

221
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,948
Did you guys
have a love spat?

222
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,719
We didn't fight but
we couldn't come together

223
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,358
Hee-jin's going through
a rough time

224
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,460
I want to be there for her

225
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,791
but it's kind of hard

226
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:40,662
Hey! Then you have to go to her!

227
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,670
What are you doing here?

228
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:45,233
I knew it when you said
you were solo

229
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:47,171
'I only know books

230
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,010
I know nothing of love'

231
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:53,048
You have that written
on your forehead

232
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,421
Sung-hae!

233
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:03,187
I liked you back in school

234
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,692
So I hesitated
before coming tonight

235
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:10,226
If we become
more than friends

236
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:13,830
then it'll be harder
on Hee-jin

237
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,642
I liked you back
in school too

238
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:22,434
That's why I e-mailed you

239
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:26,143
I was crazy curious
to see how you turned out

240
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,650
When we met up again,
you turned out better than I thought

241
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,247
I thought of
going out with you

242
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,451
But seeing you here
as my friend, I like this better

243
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,865
Mom, aren't you done yet?

244
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:52,402
Are you just looking
at the pictures?

245
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,070
My goodness,
you're a fast reader

246
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:14,426
How can tea taste
so good?

247
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,365
I put a little
hiroppon in the tea

248
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:23,036
So second hubby
sleeps out a lot, huh?

249
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,368
Don't even go there

250
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,673
He's gambling away
somewhere again

251
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:34,575
Poor mom,
no luck with men

252
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:37,152
First hubby dies early,

253
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:39,480
the second sleeps out
every day

254
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,750
It just seems, I should be
looking for number 3

255
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,734
- Mom?
- Yeah?

256
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,280
- Mom
- What?

257
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:42,643
Mom, um

258
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:48,114
Do you know
what a road movie is?

259
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,589
What are you talking about

260
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:53,720
You don't, huh?

261
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:58,898
It's when the characters
go on a trip

262
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,136
A road movie's about
what happens during the trip

263
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,973
- You mean like Whale Hunting?
- Right

264
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,806
That's a road movie

265
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:14,843
The last movie your dad and I
watched together at the theater

266
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:19,345
was Whale Hunting

267
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:59,520
Hello. I'm Hee-jin's friend,
Ji-suk Kang

268
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:04,023
Yes Um,
Hee-jin's in Pusan

269
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:06,325
She's not back yet?

270
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:09,029
No. She's staying
a few more days

271
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:15,008
Oh, I see. Thank you

272
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,072
Good-bye

273
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:35,529
Ji-suk's gone

274
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:04,089
I'll take a day off.
Let's go to the hospital on Saturday

275
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:08,592
I'm going to have it

276
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:10,523
Are you crazy?

277
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,904
What's crazy about
a pregnant woman having her baby?

278
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:17,666
Oh, no

279
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:27,277
Don't look at me
so pathetically

280
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:30,716
I hate myself, too

281
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:35,749
Why is life so hard?

282
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:37,978
What's with you?

283
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:50,296
What are you doing?

284
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:54,429
It tastes better this way

285
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:57,995
Ji-suk, man,
stop being a sap

286
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:00,837
Forget her and come to
Australia with me!

287
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,443
- Australia?
- Yeah

288
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:05,207
Why would I go there?

289
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:08,747
I'm going for a year,
on that working holiday thing

290
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:12,344
What about
the Public Servant Exam?

291
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,216
That's right,
I was gonna do that

292
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:18,020
But a few days ago,

293
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:21,763
I read a book,
50 Things You Must Do In Your 20s

294
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:24,131
One of the things
is to poop

295
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:28,734
in as many countries
as possible

296
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,737
Wow! As soon as
I read that

297
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:35,606
I got shivers up
and down my legs

298
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:39,612
So you're going all the way
to Australia to take a dump?

299
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:41,148
Come with me?

300
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:44,315
Nah, I'll just poop
in my home

301
00:36:46,655 --> 00:36:50,648
Hey, what about Yae-eun?

302
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,560
Yae-eun

303
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:56,722
Didn't I tell you?

304
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:59,298
- What?
- We broke up a few days ago

305
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,329
Why?

306
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:08,741
She and I finally
went to a motel

307
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,973
We're just about to do it
when she confesses

308
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:15,016
She's not a virgin

309
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:17,518
She already did it
with a guy at her church

310
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,052
Eun-chul,

311
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:29,092
is that all you're made of?

312
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:33,633
You broke up
cause she's not a virgin?

313
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:35,863
- It's not that
- Then what, bastard!

314
00:37:39,108 --> 00:37:42,100
All that time,
pretending to be a virgin

315
00:37:42,878 --> 00:37:44,505
'lf you love me,

316
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:47,478
if you love me, you'll wait'

317
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,677
All that was crap!

318
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:51,743
It gives me the chills, man

319
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,187
Really, it creeps me out

320
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:05,093
You still have a book out

321
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:06,599
Oh?

322
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,534
You have Moon Palace, right?

323
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,675
Oh, yes

324
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:15,868
It's quite overdue

325
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,275
Please have it back
by tomorrow

326
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,043
Yes, thank you

327
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,505
Did I keep it too long?

328
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:55,217
I feel like I learned a lot
from you in a month

329
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,580
No, I learned a lot more

330
00:38:59,488 --> 00:39:01,956
I'm at the second bullet level
at 'Fortress'

331
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:16,197
I didn't get anything
for today

332
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:20,232
White freesias mean

333
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:23,344
'I'm lucky to have
such a good friend like you'

334
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:38,787
So we're breaking up?

335
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,954
The last condition

336
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,427
After a month,
we part ways grandly!

337
00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:50,628
Hee-jin,

338
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,172
remember what you said?

339
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:58,805
In a month,
I'd be in love with you

340
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:02,479
To then say I love you

341
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:04,143
- Hee-jin
- Ji-suk

342
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:07,181
I'm gonna have it

343
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:09,851
I'm gonna have the baby

344
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:12,217
Hee-jin,

345
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:15,091
is everything
so easy for you?

346
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,597
Why are you being
so dumb?

347
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:26,601
You know I'm pretty simple

348
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:28,970
I like it, I do it

349
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,910
The end

350
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:51,818
As a quarter of
my life was ending

351
00:41:52,194 --> 00:41:54,162
she came looking for me

352
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:57,061
Maybe

353
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:04,131
as the second quarter of her life
was beginning

354
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,741
I went looking for her

355
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:19,979
It's hard to choose.
I'll come back

356
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:22,722
Whatever you choose,
timing's most important

357
00:42:24,093 --> 00:42:25,890
I'll give you a good deal

358
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:27,858
Come see me

359
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,689
Thanks

360
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,589
Hey! You and I need to talk

361
00:42:56,258 --> 00:42:58,783
- I have nothing to say to you
- You sure about that?

362
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:09,027
Let go!

363
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:27,053
I said I have no feelings
for you!

364
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,118
Where are we going?

365
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:36,054
Stop the car!

366
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,000
Stop the car now!

367
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:54,340
Are you crazy?

368
00:44:00,322 --> 00:44:02,381
Why do you keep
messing my life?

369
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:04,420
Those should be my words!

370
00:44:04,526 --> 00:44:06,323
What about
the kid in your belly?

371
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:15,562
Forget talk,
let's just get rid of it

372
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:18,833
I'll pay for it

373
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,843
Just grab a date

374
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:28,138
You seem to
have the wrong idea

375
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:31,245
It's not yours

376
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,917
What?

377
00:44:33,055 --> 00:44:34,886
It's not your baby

378
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:38,786
so stop messing with my life.
Stay out my life

379
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:11,591
But why doesn't it fit?

380
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:14,059
Because my waist is 38

381
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,093
- What? You said 34
- Well, we were dating and

382
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:19,690
- You lied to me?
- Aw Wait!

383
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:21,702
Try this one. And this

384
00:45:23,605 --> 00:45:26,039
- Hmm, it's good. Yummy
- I'm a good cook, right?

385
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:30,504
- Oh, I actually used that ladle
- That's okay. Why not?

386
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:32,569
- I'm embarrassed, that's all
- Embarrassed

387
00:45:32,714 --> 00:45:35,342
- You get embarrassed?
- Sure

388
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,609
How's the rice?

389
00:45:37,752 --> 00:45:39,379
The rice?

390
00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:41,819
- Very, very good
- Great

391
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:43,891
Now, we just need the curry

392
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:46,017
- It needs to boil down more
- It does? Okay

393
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,840
It's raining so let's hurry!

394
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,026
Hee-jin!

395
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:33,461
Hee-jin!

396
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,429
What happened?

397
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,831
Taxi!

398
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:01,286
Ji-suk! Ji-suk!

399
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:51,903
Hee-jin

400
00:48:52,246 --> 00:48:54,077
Can you hear me?

401
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,988
Are you okay?

402
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:10,096
Does it hurt?

403
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:32,816
Still, he's a good kid

404
00:49:32,987 --> 00:49:36,354
He went away cause
mommy's having a hard time

405
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:43,088
When you're ready
to be a mommy

406
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,367
when you have someone
who really loves you

407
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:48,829
he'll be back

408
00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:05,083
Are you okay?
You were here all night

409
00:50:05,787 --> 00:50:07,584
How's Hee-jin?

410
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,245
Good

411
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:12,951
I'm sorry but Hee-jin's not up
to seeing anyone right now

412
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:20,060
Please take good care of her

413
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:22,998
Don't worry

414
00:50:56,737 --> 00:50:59,035
Um, are you Ji-suk?

415
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,832
Yes. And you are?

416
00:51:02,009 --> 00:51:04,443
I'm taking over for Man-ho

417
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:08,009
- Man-ho quit his job?
- Yes

418
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:14,110
Man-ho asked me
to give you this

419
00:51:17,024 --> 00:51:18,889
I have to go now

420
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:21,061
- Thanks
- Good-bye

421
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:34,541
Hey, Mr. Writer!

422
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:38,845
I got a job at a hotel

423
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,646
It's in the country
so I had to leave right away

424
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,349
Though we met on the route

425
00:51:45,653 --> 00:51:47,587
a proper good-bye
is still in order

426
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:51,316
No one enjoyed my cooking

427
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:54,256
more than you

428
00:51:56,063 --> 00:51:58,327
You know about
good cooking

429
00:51:58,566 --> 00:52:00,329
so I'm sure
you're a good writer

430
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,932
Take care

431
00:52:30,198 --> 00:52:31,722
Hee-jin, which color?

432
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:34,393
This one's smart
and this one's sexy

433
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:36,766
The sexy one, please

434
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:38,736
Okay

435
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:42,640
But isn't too much?

436
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:46,343
You said you might go
all the way with him tonight, right?

437
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:51,781
Right. Why hide my sexiness?

438
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:02,025
No word from Ji-suk yet?

439
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:05,666
You said his name
so give me 10 bucks

440
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,864
Here, here

441
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,886
What do you think?
Really sexy, huh?

442
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:08,220
Why, don't you like the color?

443
00:54:08,296 --> 00:54:11,891
- The color's not the problem
- It'll look prettier on me

444
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:19,396
This color's a beauty!

445
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:50,096
Have a good trip

446
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:53,399
Yeah, I'll send a pretty postcard
from Australia

447
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:00,273
Ji-suk

448
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:02,282
Yeah?

449
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,278
I thought about it a lot

450
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,452
Why did Yae-eun came
clean about not

451
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:12,549
being a virgin at that
crucial moment?

452
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:19,195
Probably cause

453
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,433
she really loved me

454
00:55:25,373 --> 00:55:28,365
But what can I do?
The boat's already sailed

455
00:55:28,976 --> 00:55:31,001
Well, see ya

456
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:39,047
Bon voyage, buddy

457
00:56:22,363 --> 00:56:24,558
Ooh, f-e-e-I that sun!

458
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,898
I love the sky!

459
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,363
It's never boring

460
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,000
When I don't want to see it,
I don't have to

461
00:56:36,043 --> 00:56:39,308
And when I want to,
I can see it from anywhere

462
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,384
You really do love me,
don't you?

463
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,713
You smile at
whatever I say!

464
00:58:08,335 --> 00:58:10,030
You want it cut short?

465
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:12,237
Uh, no

466
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:14,401
I want to color it

467
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,272
It's not my first time
so it'll sting less, right?

468
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:24,182
We'll it might sting more and
be more painful than the first time

469
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:26,352
Yeah?

470
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:29,380
Well

471
00:58:30,524 --> 00:58:32,116
Let's try again, you and me
