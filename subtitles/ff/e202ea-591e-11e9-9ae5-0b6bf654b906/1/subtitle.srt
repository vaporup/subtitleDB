1
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,844
I thought we were gonna play ball.

2
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,918
Come on.

3
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,316
Come on!

4
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,763
Stay, Bo-jay

5
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:55,886
Hey, Mr Higgins.

6
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:58,606
Did you see something come down
ten minutes ago?

7
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,484
Yeah. It's in the clearing.

8
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,764
It's really incredible.
Come on, you have to come see it.

9
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,958
It's just through here.

10
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:01,720
- Sam. Great to see you. How are you?
- Mr Jarvis.

11
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,843
This is Dr Sefton.

12
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:07,363
- Mary. Hi.
- Sam. Hi.

13
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,483
- What the hell's he doing here?
- This is important, Sam.

14
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,602
- Sorry about the short notice.
- No problem.

15
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:21,678
They have their IDs?

16
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,799
So I'm a Cavanaugh now.

17
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:29,323
We're tourists. If anyone asks,
I'm Charles Cavanaugh.

18
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,159
Dr Sefton is your sister.

19
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,283
My sister?

20
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:38,395
Of whom you are extremely fond in a
clean-cut, healthy, all-American way.

21
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:42,480
- Where's my sister been all my life?
- Dr Sefton is on loan from NASA.

22
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:46,002
Jarvis, get the trunk for me,
will you?

23
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,601
Since when did the office
start drafting civilians?

24
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,645
All you need to know
is that in the scheme of things,

25
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:54,366
she is much more valuable to us
than you are.

26
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:56,597
I take it you're as valuable as ever?

27
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,678
Naturally.

28
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:02,316
So if you two are being shot at,
which bullet do I take?

29
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:05,080
You must try for both, of course.

30
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:25,117
What's so important to draw you out
of your office and into the field?

31
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:30,041
Something unusual was reported
entering our atmosphere last night.

32
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:33,517
One of our Keyhole satellites
picked this up.

33
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:42,044
- You wanna give me a hint?
- See the little blur, top left?

34
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,355
Yeah.

35
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:47,360
The analysts speculate
that's where the UFO may have landed.

36
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,876
- That's all we have?
- We immediately sent in two agents.

37
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,639
Deitman and Truly.

38
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:58,642
They have not reported back and we
have not been able to contact them.

39
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,678
Peripheral reports?

40
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:05,316
The usual ground sightings.
Reports of a landing.

41
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:09,525
Then a local TV station sent
in a mobile unit to do a spot-cast.

42
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:13,486
And they reported
that indeed a UFO had landed.

43
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,797
An hour later they changed
their tune.

44
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,639
Claimed it was a hoax.

45
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:22,243
A fraud perpetrated by a couple of
farm boys who built this spaceship.

46
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:23,965
Nice sign.

47
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,355
- You go ahead. I'll catch up.
- OK.

48
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,598
Tell me, Mary,
what exactly do you do for NASA?

49
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:58,521
- My speciality's exobiology.
- Exobiology?

50
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:02,156
It's the study of what alien life
forms might be like.

51
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,680
You make a living at that?

52
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,238
Seems it'd be mostly guesswork.

53
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,362
We used to joke in school

54
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:11,837
that ours was the only science
without a subject matter.

55
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:15,840
So you people are with the office
of scientific intelligence.

56
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:18,043
Till two days ago
I hadn't heard of it.

57
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:21,085
You wouldn't have.
Our existence isn't public knowledge.

58
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,601
Eisenhower started O-SCI back in '59.

59
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,405
We're an offshoot of the CIA,

60
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,196
but the old man runs it
like his own private dictatorship.

61
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,563
- Pay for this, will you, Sam?
- Sure, Charles.

62
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:35,639
Three for the... flying saucer.

63
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,317
What do you hear, Sam?

64
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:48,920
No birds.

65
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:53,682
Right. No birds.

66
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:38,199
Care to see inside, sir?
Only a buck more.

67
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,245
That's a bargain.
Let's have a look, shall we?

68
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,079
Sure.

69
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,441
Hi.

70
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:49,681
Let's see... Three dollars.
There you go.

71
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,163
How much have you made so far?

72
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,363
About $320.

73
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,963
I'll go first.

74
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,478
Thanks.

75
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,876
Could you help me here?

76
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,161
Thanks.

77
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,321
Thank you.

78
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,961
Let's go, lady.
I'm trying to run a business here.

79
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,083
It doesn't look safe.

80
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,965
It is. We've been taking people
through all day.

81
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,163
She balked
at the Pirates of the Caribbean.

82
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:46,965
Come on.

83
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,720
Keep the money, guys.
We're running late.

84
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,162
Come on.

85
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:53,760
Come on.

86
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:55,798
Thanks, guys.

87
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,760
- Well, Charles?
- Wait a minute.

88
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:11,806
Couldn't see anything,

89
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:14,799
but there was definitely
something strange going on.

90
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,878
What about the burn marks?

91
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,958
The burn marks were real.

92
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:22,835
Something landed there,
but not that thing.

93
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:25,999
Why that thing?
Why the cover-up? Go on, Mary.

94
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:29,716
There was something odd
about those boys. And the men.

95
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:31,604
What, precisely?

96
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:35,999
I know this doesn't necessarily
qualify as scientific evidence,

97
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:39,318
but a woman is used to
a certain response from men,

98
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:43,685
and from those boys
I didn't even get the automatic...

99
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,235
When I was introduced to Sam,
he did this.

100
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,444
I did not do that.

101
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,280
Based on what I was doing
with my blouse,

102
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,722
they should have tried
to look down my top...

103
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,718
Wouldn't have had to try very hard.

104
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:02,404
We'll go to the TV station that
broadcast those conflicting reports.

105
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,564
Try something and let me know
if you get the same reaction.

106
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,444
- Yes.
- Let's go.

107
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:13,195
- I did that when we first met?
- You're still doing it.

108
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:35,286
- Stay by the car.
- I'll keep it up there and wait.

109
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:41,806
That's fine.

110
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,885
The FCC does not take
misrepresentation lightly, Mr Barnes.

111
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,960
We made an explanation over the air.

112
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,196
What else do you want?

113
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:58,883
We fell victim to a practical joke.
It was a mistake.

114
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,764
We're only human, after all.

115
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,603
Damn. Could I borrow your pen?

116
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,358
Well, I've seen the site.

117
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,996
I find it difficult to imagine
that a couple of farm boys

118
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:25,760
could have pulled off
a hoax like that on their own.

119
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:29,203
Are you implying
that my station was in on it?

120
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,717
Be realistic.

121
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:34,562
Hold it!

122
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:47,355
He's still moving.

123
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,199
- My God!
- Well, well, well.

124
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:57,085
- What the hell is that?
- Our visitor, I presume.

125
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,486
Careful.

126
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,680
No! Sam!

127
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,156
I want to take it back.

128
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,807
Give me that case.

129
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:47,077
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr Barnes.

130
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:51,604
We will be in touch with you as soon
as I complete the investigation.

131
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,119
They're on their way right now.

132
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,801
Let's go, Sam.

133
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,084
Sorry.

134
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:19,999
This way.

135
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,406
Billy, they're coming through.

136
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:26,478
Stop them, Billy.

137
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,637
<i>...you can stay calm,</i>
<i>those around you will react...</i>

138
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:34,924
<i>Especially if you have children.</i>
<i>Once...</i>

139
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,682
Could I see some ID, please, sir?

140
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,359
Sam, you drive. Jarvis,
get in the car.

141
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,483
Get away from the car, officer.

142
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:52,239
Get in the car.

143
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:03,716
He's on the car, Sam!

144
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:05,560
Get out!

145
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,722
- Get out.
- Get him off!

146
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:21,566
Get him off.

147
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,203
It's the kid from the spaceship.

148
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,836
- Get him off the car.
- Jarvis, help him.

149
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,997
My God.

150
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:04,475
- Sam. You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

151
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,084
Make sure Langley understands we must
stop this before it spreads.

152
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,079
I want that town sealed up
completely.

153
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,964
Put up perimeter roadblocks...

154
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,686
Not local police.
They have been compromised.

155
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,758
Right?

156
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,599
The troops you send in

157
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:39,155
must put up a challenge at 100 yards

158
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:42,637
and shoot anyone
who comes closer than 50 yards.

159
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:45,924
Get Holland
to take a hazard response team

160
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,202
and investigate the landing site.

161
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,879
There is no time to waste...

162
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,037
- Thanks.
- Sure.

163
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:56,166
We should exercise
extreme caution.

164
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:59,000
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

165
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,805
What wasn't?

166
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,117
First contact.

167
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:06,119
What did you expect? ET?

168
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,402
No, but it would have been nice.

169
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,478
I never liked that little troll.

170
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:14,037
He's in his element. He's only
really happy during a crisis.

171
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:16,721
Yeah. Alive.

172
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,761
A little tense between you two?

173
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,236
Yeah, well, he's my father.

174
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,405
This is incredible.

175
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:05,557
- Graves.
- Quite incredible.

176
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:11,005
Plenty of time for amazement later.
Right now I need facts.

177
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:13,282
OK, here's one. It's dead.

178
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,595
Are you sure?

179
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:18,805
No body heat, no electrical activity
and no movement.

180
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:21,845
If we vented the chamber,
it'd be pretty ripe in there.

181
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,521
We gave it quite a jolt of
electrical current.

182
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:28,600
Probably vascular collapse, although
most parasites, when separated...

183
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,281
Dr Sefton will define
what we're dealing with.

184
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,358
Right. How do you
want to handle this?

185
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:38,396
We need to know how the creature
interfaces with our nervous system.

186
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,523
We should split into teams,

187
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:43,485
each focusing on a different aspect
of the alien.

188
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:47,003
Biochemistry, physiology,
reproduction.

189
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,362
- Endocrinology...
- Wait a minute.

190
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:52,678
What we need to know
is who we're fighting

191
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,246
and how to fight them.

192
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:56,636
Is that clear to both of you?

193
00:18:56,727 --> 00:19:01,005
It's one o'clock. In two hours
I'm calling a meeting at the office.

194
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,726
Make sure you have
something for me by then.

195
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,838
Brad, cover.

196
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,684
OK, Jim, tape this.

197
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,758
And get a water sample.

198
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:48,325
I'll be damned.

199
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,080
- Do you want me to wait?
- No. I'll check you out later.

200
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:06,084
- Any trouble in Iowa?
- Not like you people had.

201
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,601
I heard you had to take a couple
of people out.

202
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,484
These weren't people any more.

203
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,842
You shoot, they just keep on coming.

204
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,600
Any word on Deitman and Truly?

205
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:20,796
- Has anyone told their wives yet?
- Not yet.

206
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,037
So what are we looking at here?

207
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,324
It seemed something organic
had eaten its way into the earth

208
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:34,398
below the water table.

209
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:39,199
Now, whatever was hiding
in that fake saucer was moved.

210
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:41,278
A hole filled with water was left.

211
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:45,758
What's your guess? How many of those
things could have been in that hole?

212
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:50,238
Based on the size of the cavity,
could have been thousands.

213
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:53,319
I don't know if this counts for
anything, but...

214
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:58,083
that kid said 320 people had gone
through that ship about 11 hours ago.

215
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,158
What's the population of Ambrose?

216
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:02,283
10,001.

217
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:06,878
- All right, Mary, let's go.
- OK.

218
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:11,006
Please keep in mind
we were a little rushed.

219
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:18,405
Here's the creature, with an incision
along its ventral surface.

220
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:23,561
The first thing that stands out
is the complexity of its neo-cortex.

221
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:28,118
In a human, brain tissue accounts
for about 5%% of total body mass.

222
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:30,960
But in this creature,
and here's the brain tissue,

223
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:33,925
it accounts for about 60%%.

224
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:42,760
This black tentacle, which we saw
jet across Barnes's office,

225
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:48,285
contains a probe. An interface
between the creature and its host.

226
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,756
The probe penetrates the brain

227
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:56,558
while these hooks here and here
lock into the spinal column.

228
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:59,798
Together they override
the human nervous system.

229
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:06,040
Wait. Are you saying that these slugs
are using us like puppets?

230
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,516
Exactly.

231
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:11,565
You didn't mention whether
the creature has eyes. Does it?

232
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:14,366
We haven't been able
to locate any sensory organs.

233
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:17,516
Anything else?

234
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:21,964
We found human DNA and protein
inside the creature.

235
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:26,325
They're able to adapt to whichever
life form they're riding on.

236
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:29,365
We breathe oxygen
so they breathe oxygen.

237
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:30,926
The two systems merge.

238
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:33,316
Can't we exploit this
potential weakness?

239
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:36,365
What affects the host
might also affect the parasite.

240
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:39,644
We must find something
they're vulnerable to and we're not.

241
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:43,080
The people being ridden
seemed stronger than normal.

242
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:47,001
We think they boost adrenaline
production into their host.

243
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:50,079
Like injecting nitro into
a car's fuel line.

244
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:54,080
The car will run faster
but the engine will burn out sooner.

245
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:58,126
It's really quite a remarkable
organism.

246
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:00,675
Much more efficient
than anything on earth.

247
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:04,680
Look how elegant
the cartilaginous structure is.

248
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:08,601
Incredible. It doesn't use
haemoglobin in oxygen transport.

249
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,042
It uses a chlorophyll derivative.

250
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:14,199
Jeez, Graves. He sounds like
he wants to fuck the thing.

251
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:16,596
Shut up, Holland.

252
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,362
Dr Sefton, do you have any idea
how we should proceed?

253
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:22,677
This was a preliminary postmortem...

254
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,837
When did you quit smoking?

255
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,280
- Must have left them in the car.
- Stop him!

256
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,958
Jesus. He's got one on him!

257
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:46,606
Security!

258
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,762
Alex, go upstairs!

259
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:55,759
Secure the exit.
Bonnie, call 334, main gate.

260
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:57,644
- Come on, upstairs.
- Main gate.

261
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,962
Alex!

262
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,642
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

263
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,959
- Harris, get a medic.
- Right.

264
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:41,286
- Sam?
- We got him.

265
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:50,002
I guess that thing
jumped onto whoever it ran into.

266
00:25:57,367 --> 00:26:00,518
Put your gun down, Sam. Slowly.

267
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:03,167
Take off your shirt.

268
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,117
Thank you.

269
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:23,205
Well, let's find it.
Search everybody.

270
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:28,078
Right, everyone's accounted for.

271
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,317
- One of the aliens...
- This was on Jarvis.

272
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:35,197
It contains every emergency
contingency we've drawn up since '59.

273
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:40,402
One of the alien life forms
is loose in the building.

274
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:45,003
We have to presume that it's riding
on the back of one of us.

275
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,885
Sam, show them your back.

276
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,635
Sam is clean.

277
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:03,324
Holland. Gorman.
Miss Haines. Everybody.

278
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:15,725
Miss Haines. Everybody.

279
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,846
What about you, sir?

280
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,684
Yeah, she's right. You're not exempt.

281
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,116
Stop her!

282
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:34,796
Gannet, Beasley, come on!

283
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,044
Miss Haines!

284
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,922
Miss Haines! Come back here!

285
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,523
Let go of me!

286
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,319
- They're down in the kitchen.
- Hurry up! Let's go down!

287
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,637
Damn! I lost it!

288
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:43,036
Forget it. Forget it.

289
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:45,243
I lost it.

290
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,876
It was too quick.
It went up through there.

291
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:51,923
I want that thing found tonight.

292
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:54,157
Turn the building upside down,
but find it.

293
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:56,442
- Miss Haines?
- Sam, get cleaned up.

294
00:28:57,207 --> 00:29:00,597
I want every second of Jarvis's time
accounted for.

295
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:03,599
I want to know everything he was
up to since we left Iowa.

296
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:05,757
Go and get a medic, will you?

297
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:11,963
God...

298
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:21,484
He's been like this
since you brought him in.

299
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:26,163
In many ways he's exhibiting
classic withdrawal symptoms,

300
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,205
much like you'd find
in a drug addict.

301
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:33,360
Are you saying he was actually
addicted to having that thing on him?

302
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:36,280
No, he's saying
that the presence of the thing

303
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,837
satisfies some need or other.

304
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:41,804
Thanks, doc.

305
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:45,436
Jarvis is cold turkey
and Miss Haines is in a coma.

306
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:48,564
- All victims will react this way?
- How would you react?

307
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:51,036
One minute you have this huge brain,
the next moment you don't.

308
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:52,560
Think of it.

309
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:01,286
It'd be a lot easier if they had
a live specimen to work with.

310
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:06,316
- What do you think these things are?
- Let's have a look.

311
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,524
They almost look like antennae.

312
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:15,438
What are they receiving?

313
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,757
Or transmitting, for that matter.

314
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:21,806
Radar, maybe. Or sonar signals,
like bats.

315
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:27,245
Do you think that's how the aliens
are able to recognise each other?

316
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:25,440
<i>Yeah?</i>

317
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:31,322
- You're the manager of the building?
- Yeah. Can I help you?

318
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:34,524
I need to get inside the apartment
of Neil Jarvis.

319
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:38,437
Yeah, sure.

320
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,836
Just a second.
I'll be right with you.

321
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:44,316
Do you have a crowbar?

322
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:46,796
No, I got the keys.

323
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,798
Up this way.

324
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:52,838
Anybody here?

325
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:56,878
Hello?

326
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,200
These arrived this morning for
Mr Jarvis.

327
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,199
- I let the delivery people in.
- Give me a hand.

328
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:07,399
Yeah, sure.

329
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:11,603
Iowa. I wonder what that's all about.

330
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,156
What the hell are those things?

331
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:10,997
<i>The president's scheduled appearance</i>
<i>at the digital age conference</i>

332
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,920
<i>has drawn harsh criticism</i>
<i>from Senator Allen,</i>

333
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:17,636
<i>who categorised the visit</i>
<i>as blatant grandstanding.</i>

334
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:28,476
Make sure the magnetometer's cranked
up early. We don't want delays.

335
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,956
Has headquarters given us
the name of our post standers?

336
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:33,242
Yes.

337
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:36,080
I need more agents on that balcony.

338
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:39,079
- And all along this perimeter.
- OK.

339
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,156
Long time no see.

340
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:45,683
Good to see you, Bruce. This is
Evan Greenberg, one of my agents.

341
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,758
- How are you, Evan?
- Hi.

342
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:49,326
What brings you down here?

343
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:52,444
I understand the president
is scheduled to appear here.

344
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:54,245
If everything goes as planned.

345
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:58,240
There's a situation developing
that I think you need to know about.

346
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:01,038
Can we talk in private?

347
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:05,045
Yeah. Come on.

348
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:24,163
OK. Now, Sam, what's this all about?

349
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:27,920
What the hell are you doing?

350
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:49,927
<i>Please take your seats. The opening</i>
<i>session is about to begin.</i>

351
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:42,959
- Good to see you.
- Welcome, Mr President. This way.

352
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,486
Get him.

353
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,319
Alpha One, he's headed your way.

354
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:24,157
Watch where you're going.

355
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:40,475
Bruce, will you tell me
what's happening here, please?

356
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:58,121
<i>Clear?</i>

357
00:36:58,207 --> 00:37:01,040
<i>Dead.</i>

358
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,366
Are you all right, sir?

359
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:10,562
Andrew.

360
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,600
What in God's name is going on?

361
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:25,361
Damn! There! There he is!

362
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:27,961
Stop! Hold it!

363
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,286
Stop!

364
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,203
Again.

365
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,843
Watch out!

366
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:53,361
Hold up.

367
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,882
Jesus, that was close.

368
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:10,442
- You think he would have shot me?
- Of course he would.

369
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,882
Get him to the lab.

370
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,039
What does all this mean?

371
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:49,403
Top line is Sam's heart rate.
Bottom is the alien's.

372
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,557
They're identical. Brain waves too.

373
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,444
Their nervous systems are linked.

374
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:57,759
Pulse is 120. Blood pressure
140<i>l</i>90.Temperature 103.

375
00:38:57,847 --> 00:38:59,405
Creature's running him hot.

376
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:02,285
Move the fluoroscope
to the right profile, please.

377
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,356
What's this?

378
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:08,567
An electromagnetic signal. At first
we thought it was just interference.

379
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,922
It seems to be coming
from the parasite.

380
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:13,237
- You were right, then. Radar.
- Yeah.

381
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,681
- Let me hear it.
- It's too high a frequency.

382
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:20,402
Wake him up. I'm going in there.

383
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:24,685
Sir, it's not a good idea.
I don't think it's safe in there.

384
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:27,156
It's Sam, Lawrence.

385
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:31,439
- Sir?
- It's all right.

386
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:34,401
Wake him up, Jim.

387
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,878
Bring me that stool.

388
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,046
Can you hear me?

389
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,198
Sam isn't here any more, Andrew.

390
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:00,517
You know me?

391
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,723
And your dead wife.

392
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,077
And Mary.

393
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:19,201
You wouldn't believe the fantasies
my host has about you, Mary.

394
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,881
- Would you like me to tell you?
- No, we would not.

395
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:26,404
I will ask the questions,
and if you do not cooperate,

396
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:29,285
I'll administer electric shocks
and you will die.

397
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,803
I will stop the heart of this host
and it will die.

398
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:40,603
Get him back!

399
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:43,042
- He's gone flatline!
- 2cc of ephinephrine!

400
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:46,802
2cc of ephinephrine, stat.

401
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:48,843
It's back.

402
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:51,919
Hold that ephinephrine.

403
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:57,006
My God, it has total control.

404
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:06,999
Sam, why have they come here?
What do they want?

405
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:13,677
I warned you.

406
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,644
Shock it.

407
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:41,438
I acknowledge you can hurt me, but
each shock shortens your son's life.

408
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:43,836
Do you understand?

409
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:46,566
Of course I understand.

410
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,562
Now you answer me.

411
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:51,763
Why are you here?

412
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,362
Our previous hosts ceased to be
useful.

413
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:02,564
You are stronger than they were.
You will last longer.

414
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:06,356
Right. How many are you?

415
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:12,281
One.

416
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,844
There may be semantic differences.

417
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:20,363
Its concept of identity
may be different.

418
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,395
No.

419
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:25,358
No.

420
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:27,005
How many are you?

421
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:29,081
One.

422
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:37,277
Sam, do you have any idea
how many of them there are?

423
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:43,006
It was thinking "one".
It doesn't know why you keep...

424
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,321
Always giving orders, aren't you,
Andrew?

425
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:51,967
Always telling people how to run
their lives.

426
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:57,125
Maybe that's why you're so Ionely.
Did you ever think of that?

427
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:01,559
Maybe that's why
your son resents you so much.

428
00:43:07,487 --> 00:43:12,607
You won't be Ionely when you're
one of us. No-one will be.

429
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:15,406
For God's sake,
tell us what you want.

430
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,921
Peace.

431
00:43:25,927 --> 00:43:28,566
Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.

432
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:36,995
Jesus. It's killing him.

433
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,440
Get it off him!

434
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,246
It's gone.

435
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:37,996
Welcome back.

436
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:45,925
I'm sorry you had to
go through that, son.

437
00:44:48,007 --> 00:44:50,282
Those things I said, Dad.

438
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:54,243
- It wasn't me talking.
- Come on.

439
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:59,202
Do you remember what happened?

440
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,315
I was aware. I was conscious of what
I was doing and what was happening.

441
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,002
It was like having one of those
dreams when you're paralysed.

442
00:45:11,247 --> 00:45:17,117
No matter how much I tried
to move or scream, I just couldn't.

443
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:20,961
It had total control over me.

444
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:25,364
I was like an open book to them.

445
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:30,362
They could read everything in my
mind. My thoughts, fears, memories.

446
00:45:30,447 --> 00:45:32,642
Did they have thoughts?

447
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:41,887
I remember something about...

448
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:47,440
<i>...</i>their ship...

449
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:52,726
It wasn't a ship, though.
It was like a nerve centre.

450
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:54,798
A hive.

451
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,242
Had to get back to it...

452
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:03,036
<i>...</i>to share information
with the others.

453
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,597
You know where it is? Do you?

454
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,158
I'm not sure where, really.

455
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:18,396
Get some rest.

456
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:21,483
Get some rest.

457
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,799
Let me know as soon as
I can try again.

458
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:35,526
<i>Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.</i>

459
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:41,121
That's enough of that. Take it off.

460
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:43,084
Sir.

461
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,284
The parasites run their hosts
at a high body temperature,

462
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:49,086
which gives them
an identifiable heat signature.

463
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,159
We have been able to track
that heat signature

464
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:56,479
through thermal imaging from
satellite sweeps and reconnaissance.

465
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:59,081
Run the RPV recording.

466
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:03,797
This is Ambrose, and those red areas
are creature-controlled.

467
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:06,959
Give me maximum magnification here,
please.

468
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:09,197
I want to show you something.

469
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:13,356
These are human beings
with creatures on their back.

470
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:16,598
- What's the green dot?
- A human being without a creature.

471
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:19,838
He's surrounded
by parasite-controlled hosts.

472
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:23,919
And now he too has a parasite
on his back.

473
00:48:45,247 --> 00:48:48,876
I'm not... I'm not coming.

474
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,720
I'm sorry, Dad.

475
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:56,363
Get this off me.

476
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:11,965
Everybody, just get off of me.

477
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:18,158
It's OK.

478
00:49:22,487 --> 00:49:26,036
- Get it off me!
- It's not on you any more.

479
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:28,118
It's not on you any more.

480
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:30,641
OK? You're OK.

481
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:32,718
- You're OK.
- I can still feel it.

482
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:35,241
It's gone. It's gone.

483
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:03,517
You're all right.

484
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:08,681
Have we been in contact
with the governor?

485
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,325
What about the Iowa National Guard?

486
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,717
They will have been infiltrated.
You have to go in on a federal level.

487
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:16,844
Our nearest troops are the first
infantry division at Fort Riley.

488
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:21,239
- How quickly can we move on this?
- You'll have a force in 12 hours.

489
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:25,115
I recommend we go in at night to take
advantage of the thermal imaging.

490
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:29,078
Do it.

491
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:53,606
Wait. I see something.

492
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:24,045
We're going in.

493
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:37,838
Go.

494
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,277
Shit.

495
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:51,957
- Gentlemen.
- What's this?

496
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:56,518
- This is a thermal image feed.
- It's from Lieutenant Abbey's unit.

497
00:52:58,807 --> 00:53:01,196
They're using children?

498
00:53:01,287 --> 00:53:04,677
You cannot think of them as children.
They are the enemy.

499
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:32,797
General?

500
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:38,440
- They're here to see you, sir.
- In the office. I'll be in soon.

501
00:53:42,007 --> 00:53:44,441
This way, men.

502
00:53:56,927 --> 00:54:01,478
We've lost satellite link-up, but
we have Lieutenant Abbey on audio.

503
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:03,842
<i>The situation's under control now.</i>

504
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:06,361
<i>We'll bring the children</i>
<i>into the holding area</i>

505
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:09,166
<i>then move on to sector seven.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

506
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:11,283
So far so good.

507
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:14,204
What's going on in here?

508
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:17,120
Captain Earley, sir.
Iowa National Guard, Camp Dodge.

509
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:19,198
We're here to provide backup.

510
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:22,085
I didn't hear anything
about you being called in.

511
00:54:24,687 --> 00:54:28,396
- Get me Washington on the line.
- I'd rather you didn't.

512
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:00,200
Did you find a way
to kill them?

513
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:02,881
No, not yet. We're trying everything.

514
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:05,606
Different bacteria, viruses,
radiation.

515
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:09,756
But so far we've found nothing
that doesn't kill the host.

516
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:17,600
See the one looking at us? He's
wearing the slug we took off you.

517
00:55:17,687 --> 00:55:19,837
They've been sitting like that
for hours.

518
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:23,806
Yeah, they're merging. It's how
they communicate with each other.

519
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:26,916
- Yeah?
- They exchange chemical signatures.

520
00:55:27,007 --> 00:55:29,646
We're ready, Dr Graves.

521
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:34,525
We should have thought of that.

522
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:37,280
Ants communicate in the same way.

523
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,879
Where did you get
the second parasite?

524
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:41,877
Just watch.

525
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:47,681
We set up a keyboard
in case they want to talk to us.

526
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:49,758
Vargas, note the time.

527
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:01,200
- Does the old man know about this?
- He wanted to make sure.

528
00:56:02,327 --> 00:56:04,124
Here we go again.

529
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:07,836
This is how they reproduce.

530
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:10,077
A second adult parasite in minutes.

531
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:12,840
Vargas, get the old man on the line.

532
00:56:15,647 --> 00:56:17,524
Watch what they do to the little one.

533
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:57,965
The new one knows me.

534
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:06,046
I've got General Morgan reporting in.

535
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,805
Andrew Nivens here, general.

536
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,117
How is it going down there?

537
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:15,836
It was touch and go for a while,
but we think the worst is over now.

538
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:17,645
- It's your son.
- Hang on, Sam.

539
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:19,683
<i>We've got 70%% % of the area contained</i>

540
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:22,042
- <i>and kept casualties fairly low.</i>
- Thank you.

541
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:26,803
Would you take off your shirt
and turn your back to the camera?

542
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:30,797
- <i>Is this a joke?</i>
- No, it's not. Take off your shirt.

543
00:57:30,887 --> 00:57:32,684
<i>I don't take my orders from you.</i>

544
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:35,876
Order him to take off his shirt. Sam,
go on.

545
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:42,917
I'm sorry, general. Would you
humour us for a moment, please?

546
00:57:44,847 --> 00:57:46,883
God.

547
00:57:55,127 --> 00:57:58,278
- There's no signal coming in.
- What's going on?

548
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:02,956
The transmission isn't lost.

549
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:07,484
The transmission has been cut because
General Morgan has been taken,

550
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,286
and we can assume
that his troops are now our enemy.

551
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:15,518
We're getting reports
that the situation's been contained.

552
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:18,724
The reports are faked.
We're being manipulated.

553
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:21,082
I have just been told

554
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:26,158
that their numbers are increasing
infinitely more than anticipated.

555
00:58:26,247 --> 00:58:28,238
We've lost a town, sir.

556
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:30,443
Now we've lost an army.

557
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:36,762
They're capable of transmitting
not just intelligence but memory

558
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:40,237
from one body to the next
by coming into physical contact.

559
00:58:40,327 --> 00:58:43,524
The new one knew Sam as if
it had been the one on his back?

560
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,006
Yes.

561
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:47,726
How long does it take it
to prepare for division?

562
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:52,085
12 hours. Let's assume
we started with 1,000 of them.

563
00:58:52,567 --> 00:58:56,845
We'll be conservative.
That's one day, 4,000.

564
00:58:56,927 --> 00:59:00,203
Two days, 16,000.

565
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:06,564
- In two weeks there would be...
- More than 250 billion.

566
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:25,363
You OK?

567
00:59:27,527 --> 00:59:29,518
I don't know why your father
picked me.

568
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,997
- I won't be able to find the answer.
- Wait.

569
00:59:34,327 --> 00:59:36,363
He knows what he's doing.

570
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,756
You'll find something.

571
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:41,042
No, Mary, you will.

572
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,438
Thanks, Sam.

573
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:49,803
He's given everyone
a few hours off to recuperate.

574
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:53,719
I don't have time to go to the hotel.
I'll go back to the lab.

575
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,082
No, I...

576
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:58,727
I just live a few blocks from here.

577
01:00:00,607 --> 01:00:02,325
OK.

578
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:29,162
That wasn't very friendly.

579
01:00:29,247 --> 01:00:32,284
I wouldn't take it personally.
He's kind of a prima donna.

580
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:39,040
- How about if I make a fire?
- That'd be great.

581
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,083
Is that OK for him
to go out like that?

582
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,681
Yeah, yeah. He comes and goes.

583
01:00:47,207 --> 01:00:49,846
- Is this your mom?
- Yeah.

584
01:00:52,367 --> 01:00:54,562
She's pretty.

585
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:58,957
She died about a year
after that picture was taken.

586
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:04,522
What was it like growing up with him?

587
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:07,075
- Boot camp.
- I'll bet.

588
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:10,642
Whenever he was working at home,

589
01:01:10,727 --> 01:01:13,799
he'd give me a quarter
for every hour I could keep quiet.

590
01:01:19,287 --> 01:01:24,122
One day, I remember it was...
it was a Saturday morning.

591
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:26,880
I decided I wouldn't say anything
until he did,

592
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:28,923
even if it took all weekend.

593
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:32,645
But he never said anything.

594
01:01:33,207 --> 01:01:36,005
I don't think he even noticed.

595
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:40,081
So how much did you make?

596
01:01:43,607 --> 01:01:46,041
About 12 bucks.

597
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:26,442
Shit.

598
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:37,557
It's the old man.

599
01:02:55,727 --> 01:02:57,524
Yeah.

600
01:02:58,887 --> 01:03:00,684
Yeah, she's here with me.

601
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,638
Yeah. OK.

602
01:03:09,007 --> 01:03:12,966
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just dropped the phone.

603
01:03:14,327 --> 01:03:17,160
Look who turned out
to be a sweetie after all.

604
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,043
So?

605
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:30,561
So we have to go back.

606
01:03:36,607 --> 01:03:40,520
Maybe we could stay
another... ten minutes.

607
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:14,085
Don't move.

608
01:04:52,607 --> 01:04:54,757
Why did you do that, Sam?

609
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:04,436
What's the matter, Sam?

610
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:07,246
Isn't this what you wanted
from the day we met?

611
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:10,038
You and I together.

612
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,998
You can't hurt her, can you?

613
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:33,363
But I can.

614
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:30,956
Mary got it off your cat? Jesus.

615
01:06:31,047 --> 01:06:33,356
They've taken her back to their hive,
I'm positive.

616
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:37,235
If they've taken her back there,
there's nothing we can do about her.

617
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,555
I'm going after her.

618
01:06:38,647 --> 01:06:40,877
No, you're not.
It's a suicide mission.

619
01:06:40,967 --> 01:06:42,446
You don't understand the enemy.

620
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:44,518
I won't have you
on the casualty list.

621
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,565
I have to find the hive,
get inside and get information.

622
01:06:47,647 --> 01:06:51,560
In 12 hours that area will be a war
zone. You're not thinking rationally.

623
01:06:51,647 --> 01:06:54,844
Dad, I'm sick of thinking rationally.
I'm going after her!

624
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,486
Do you intend to help me or not?

625
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,966
It's receiving OK.

626
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:13,481
<i>Minneapolis has been invaded.</i>

627
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:16,604
<i>Civil authorities are fighting</i>
<i>to keep the situation under control,</i>

628
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:18,996
<i>but they are not having much luck.</i>

629
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:23,164
It's good, but the frequency
still isn't matching.

630
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:29,079
<i>What safeguards can be taken</i>
<i>to protect you and your family?</i>

631
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:31,442
<i>Keep your doors and windows locked.</i>

632
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:35,315
<i>Don't let anyone into your home,</i>
<i>even if they appear to be a friend.</i>

633
01:07:35,407 --> 01:07:37,921
<i>If you absolutely have to</i>
<i>venture outside...</i>

634
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:40,043
OK, can we get started?

635
01:07:40,127 --> 01:07:43,119
<i>Stay tuned to this station</i>
<i>for further updates.</i>

636
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:48,156
There's some sort of a hive that
they have to go back to regularly.

637
01:07:48,247 --> 01:07:50,397
Central source.
Intelligence replenishing.

638
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:51,715
Exactly.

639
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:53,206
OK, let's run this.

640
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:58,081
I've had the analysts sort through
the thermal image data we've gathered

641
01:07:58,167 --> 01:08:00,886
in order to plot the expansion
of the alien colony.

642
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:04,039
This is a satellite picture of Iowa
when the UFO was sighted.

643
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:06,436
Here. Day 1. Now watch.

644
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:12,201
The orange shape represents the
spread of the colony over five days.

645
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:18,315
Now, what you'd expect,

646
01:08:18,407 --> 01:08:22,116
if it's necessary to stay close to
the hive, with Iowa's topography,

647
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:24,926
is that the shape would be
roughly circular.

648
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:28,682
So we rationalised it
into three overlapping circles.

649
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:30,917
Could you do that, please?

650
01:08:33,887 --> 01:08:36,003
If we shrink these circles back,

651
01:08:37,007 --> 01:08:39,680
we find the location of the hive
at different times.

652
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:42,486
Each time the hive is on the river.

653
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:45,001
That could be how they moved it.

654
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,885
All right. This is where
it all started.

655
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:50,481
This is where the hive is now.

656
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:52,599
Des Moines.

657
01:08:52,687 --> 01:08:55,963
Makes sense. High population density.

658
01:08:56,047 --> 01:08:58,163
And it'd be easier to defend.

659
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:06,955
We've narrowed its location to a
ten-block radius in the city centre.

660
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,197
That's where Mary is. I know it.

661
01:09:10,287 --> 01:09:14,439
Show me the projected size of
the colony in the next 24 hours.

662
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:30,761
We'll parachute in tonight.

663
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,925
- We have six hours.
- We'll need eight.

664
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,476
You've got eight hours.

665
01:09:57,567 --> 01:10:00,843
You've got a very tight eight-hour
window to pull this off.

666
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:03,043
- After that you're on your own.
- Yes.

667
01:10:03,127 --> 01:10:05,516
- Opening drill.
- Look, reach, pull.

668
01:10:05,607 --> 01:10:07,040
Good.

669
01:10:09,807 --> 01:10:12,002
Wait up!

670
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:17,324
I just want to tell you
we jerry-rigged these transmitters

671
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:20,365
so they send out
the same frequency as the aliens.

672
01:10:20,447 --> 01:10:22,915
It's how they recognise each other.

673
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:26,079
If you don't get too close,
they'll think you're one of them.

674
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,839
- Beautiful.
- Nice.

675
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:29,485
- Thanks, Graves.
- Thanks.

676
01:10:29,567 --> 01:10:32,240
Hey, Graves, I think you're a genius,
man.

677
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:36,157
I just want to apologise for that
comment I made back in the room.

678
01:10:36,247 --> 01:10:38,203
About you fucking the thing.

679
01:10:38,287 --> 01:10:40,243
- Let's go!
- I didn't mean it.

680
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:42,761
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Good luck.

681
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:47,125
<i>...</i>choppers. We'll have to use
army vehicles and supply them here.

682
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:55,922
We have to cover this terrain...

683
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:55,758
Danny?

684
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:22,882
Somebody help!

685
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,160
Forget it, Alex.

686
01:12:28,047 --> 01:12:29,400
No!

687
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,716
Jesus, I don't wanna end up
like that.

688
01:12:37,807 --> 01:12:40,367
- Trapped inside my own body.
- Come on.

689
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:50,878
He wants to merge.

690
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:02,358
Remind me to thank Graves.

691
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:06,918
<i>The president's announcement has sent</i>
<i>shock waves throughout the country.</i>

692
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:09,441
They should be at the city centre
now, sir.

693
01:13:09,527 --> 01:13:12,564
<i>...have been filtering in</i>
<i>from virtually every state.</i>

694
01:13:12,647 --> 01:13:17,004
<i>In response, the president has</i>
<i>declared a state of emergency,</i>

695
01:13:17,087 --> 01:13:20,523
<i>instituting martial law</i>
<i>in all major urban centres.</i>

696
01:13:20,607 --> 01:13:23,599
<i>In related news,</i>
<i>the financial world...</i>

697
01:13:50,887 --> 01:13:55,677
<i>All units designated primary</i>
<i>and secondary to proceed to level P2.</i>

698
01:13:55,767 --> 01:13:58,998
<i>All other units</i>
<i>should assemble on the first floor.</i>

699
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:03,519
- This has to be it.
- Let's go around back.

700
01:14:20,647 --> 01:14:22,319
It's down there.

701
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:34,158
- I should be going with you.
- Just give me 20 minutes.

702
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:39,318
How will I know it's really you?

703
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:42,562
If it's not, you know what to do.

704
01:16:22,647 --> 01:16:26,640
<i>Share information... with the others.</i>

705
01:16:31,807 --> 01:16:36,323
<i>Sam, why are they here?</i>
<i>What do they want?</i>

706
01:16:36,407 --> 01:16:39,240
<i>My thoughts, my fears.</i>

707
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:40,919
<i>My memories.</i>

708
01:16:41,007 --> 01:16:43,840
<i>You won't be lonely</i>
<i>when you're one of us.</i>

709
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:46,999
<i>No-one will be.</i>

710
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:02,962
<i>It's everything</i>
<i>you try to hide from yourself.</i>

711
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:09,004
<i>Isn't this what you always wanted?</i>

712
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:14,081
<i>You wouldn't need the fantasies</i>
<i>that life was just about you.</i>

713
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,556
<i>You and I, together.</i>

714
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:20,926
<i>You can't hurt her, can you?</i>

715
01:17:21,007 --> 01:17:22,998
- <i>It's not on him.</i>
- <i>Get it off me!</i>

716
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:25,078
<i>But I can.</i>

717
01:17:25,167 --> 01:17:27,556
<i>Get it off me!</i>

718
01:18:23,527 --> 01:18:25,597
Don't move, don't move.

719
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:56,446
Fuck.

720
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:06,916
You all right?

721
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:10,556
There's something you've gotta see.
It's important, Sam.

722
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:25,244
Wait.

723
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:29,283
Stay close to me.

724
01:19:33,927 --> 01:19:36,395
This is why they wanted me.

725
01:19:41,127 --> 01:19:44,199
Jesus, Mary, what is this place?

726
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,644
While we've been studying them,
they've been studying us.

727
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:53,561
More dead bodies. Great.
Can we get out of here?

728
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:56,238
He's alive!

729
01:19:56,327 --> 01:19:58,363
Get him out of there!

730
01:20:00,247 --> 01:20:04,399
This is what we want. Something
killed the parasite but not the boy.

731
01:20:27,127 --> 01:20:28,526
Why did it die?

732
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:33,076
He must have contracted
something fatal to his parasite.

733
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:36,443
He was sealed off in here
so he wouldn't infect the others.

734
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:38,722
This is it.

735
01:20:40,287 --> 01:20:41,766
Come on.

736
01:20:56,967 --> 01:20:59,162
That's Alex. Take the kid.

737
01:21:21,927 --> 01:21:24,487
Alex! I got him! Let's go!

738
01:21:47,007 --> 01:21:48,645
Help!

739
01:21:59,527 --> 01:22:02,485
Come on!
We can't help him. Come on.

740
01:22:12,647 --> 01:22:14,319
Come on.

741
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:28,642
You gotta get up on the roof. Go.

742
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:37,717
This'll keep them busy.

743
01:22:49,207 --> 01:22:52,995
<i>Code eight. All units to South Plaza.</i>

744
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:56,482
Main power supply.

745
01:22:58,527 --> 01:23:00,882
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah.

746
01:23:02,087 --> 01:23:03,645
Do you think you can walk?

747
01:23:04,527 --> 01:23:06,597
They'll pick us up on the roof.

748
01:23:13,967 --> 01:23:16,162
They're coming.

749
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:17,475
Go!

750
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:20,597
Come on!

751
01:23:39,407 --> 01:23:41,602
- Take the kid.
- OK. I got him.

752
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:16,843
You weren't planning on leaving
without me, were you, buddy?

753
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:26,962
Go. Get him to the roof.

754
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:28,844
Let's talk about it, Alex.

755
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:33,358
Here, kitty-kitty.

756
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:43,037
I'll talk to you, Sam.

757
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,559
I know you're in here.

758
01:25:09,047 --> 01:25:14,246
If I have to look for you too long,
it's gonna really piss me off.

759
01:25:36,847 --> 01:25:39,236
Where are you,
you lousy son of a bitch?

760
01:25:39,327 --> 01:25:41,602
You said you'd help me.

761
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,917
You're no better than your father.

762
01:25:49,367 --> 01:25:52,040
Help me!

763
01:25:53,927 --> 01:25:55,804
God!

764
01:25:58,247 --> 01:25:59,839
Come on!

765
01:26:01,487 --> 01:26:03,682
- Alex, man, fight it!
- Yaaagh!

766
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:05,644
Fight it, man! Fight it!

767
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,797
How could he, Sam? You couldn't.

768
01:26:10,007 --> 01:26:11,725
Don't leave me!

769
01:26:11,807 --> 01:26:14,685
- Please, Sam, get it off!
- Alex?

770
01:26:14,767 --> 01:26:16,837
- Alex!
- Get it off!

771
01:26:18,727 --> 01:26:21,082
Not very smart, are you, Sam?

772
01:26:25,207 --> 01:26:27,277
Pick him up. Bring him here.

773
01:26:27,367 --> 01:26:29,676
It's safe. Come on!

774
01:26:30,847 --> 01:26:32,678
Where are the others?

775
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:56,077
You never did have a right hand.

776
01:26:56,967 --> 01:26:58,286
Come here.

777
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:33,397
We gotta go. Where's Holland?

778
01:27:33,487 --> 01:27:35,364
He didn't make it.

779
01:27:47,447 --> 01:27:49,756
- You all right?
- Yeah.

780
01:27:51,407 --> 01:27:54,001
Get Nivens on the radio.

781
01:28:04,327 --> 01:28:08,764
The boy has encephalitis, which
causes inflammation of the brain.

782
01:28:08,847 --> 01:28:12,078
It's not fatal to humans
if it's treated in a few days,

783
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,840
but the aliens are 60%% brain matter,

784
01:28:14,927 --> 01:28:18,397
so it should kill them first,
allowing us to save the host.

785
01:28:18,487 --> 01:28:21,843
- How long has it been?
- 33 minutes.

786
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:25,397
There's still the question of disease
vectors. How it would spread.

787
01:28:25,487 --> 01:28:26,886
Mosquitoes.

788
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:28,036
Yes.

789
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:30,277
Mosquitoes.

790
01:28:30,367 --> 01:28:35,395
We could release infected batches
over the areas controlled by aliens.

791
01:28:36,127 --> 01:28:37,958
Wait.

792
01:28:41,847 --> 01:28:44,156
Jesus.

793
01:28:44,247 --> 01:28:46,283
It's disgusting.

794
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:50,996
33 minutes, 18 seconds.
That's it. We've done it.

795
01:28:51,087 --> 01:28:54,204
Yes, but how do we get to them all?
They've spread so far.

796
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,199
We don't need to.
There's only one alien.

797
01:28:57,287 --> 01:29:02,077
We've been thinking of millions. It's
one creature with a million parts.

798
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:03,839
The same way
they transmit information,

799
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:06,521
they'll transmit the disease.

800
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:10,520
A chain reaction. We can infect
the colony as if it were one body.

801
01:29:10,607 --> 01:29:12,438
Perfect.

802
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:24,079
We've got General Morgan
coming in from Fort Riley.

803
01:29:28,967 --> 01:29:31,162
Bring the camera over here, please.

804
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:33,883
Well, we're all clean, sir.

805
01:29:34,647 --> 01:29:36,160
It seems to be working.

806
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:40,206
The medics are administering
the antitoxin throughout the area.

807
01:29:40,287 --> 01:29:44,075
Most of my men are sick as hell,
but the aliens are dying.

808
01:30:32,807 --> 01:30:35,958
O1 to P3. All clear.

809
01:30:38,527 --> 01:30:40,404
Anything?

810
01:30:43,207 --> 01:30:45,084
Yes.

811
01:30:45,647 --> 01:30:47,877
Yeah. They're on their way down?
Good.

812
01:30:47,967 --> 01:30:50,356
All clear down here.

813
01:31:26,847 --> 01:31:29,520
What were they trying to do here?

814
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:35,006
Rebuild their home.

815
01:31:36,647 --> 01:31:38,603
Careful, sir.

816
01:32:15,247 --> 01:32:17,238
My God!

817
01:32:37,327 --> 01:32:39,887
Everybody OK down there?

818
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:46,635
Soldier, down here.

819
01:32:47,767 --> 01:32:48,643
You OK?

820
01:32:48,727 --> 01:32:53,198
I'm fine. Sorry. It was silly of me.
I should have been more careful.

821
01:32:53,287 --> 01:32:55,278
Check him out, please.

822
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:56,436
He's clean.

823
01:32:56,527 --> 01:32:58,882
- Sorry, sir...
- No, please don't apologise.

824
01:32:58,967 --> 01:33:01,401
We'll need to take samples
of the structure.

825
01:33:01,487 --> 01:33:03,796
It's a pity we couldn't save it.

826
01:33:03,887 --> 01:33:06,082
What we might have learned...

827
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:08,442
Well, I've seen enough.

828
01:33:08,527 --> 01:33:10,279
Thank you.

829
01:33:25,247 --> 01:33:29,160
I don't think I would have believed
it was really over.

830
01:33:37,327 --> 01:33:38,123
How you doing?

831
01:33:38,207 --> 01:33:40,243
I can't believe
I slept for two days.

832
01:33:40,327 --> 01:33:43,000
Excuse me, sir.
Dr Nivens forgot his cane.

833
01:33:43,767 --> 01:33:45,644
Give me a hand up.

834
01:33:45,727 --> 01:33:47,957
- There you go.
- Thanks very much.

835
01:33:53,247 --> 01:33:55,442
Thank you.

836
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:24,606
Come on, soldier. On the double.

837
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:25,802
Move!

838
01:34:33,407 --> 01:34:36,240
Call in emergency services now.

839
01:34:49,047 --> 01:34:51,038
Hello, Sam.

840
01:34:54,687 --> 01:34:57,406
I can fly a helicopter.

841
01:35:00,887 --> 01:35:02,115
Perfectly.

842
01:35:08,607 --> 01:35:10,677
You never told me how good it felt.

843
01:35:10,767 --> 01:35:14,123
I had no idea man could feel
such a sense of freedom.

844
01:35:14,207 --> 01:35:16,641
- My God!
- When did you take him?

845
01:35:16,727 --> 01:35:19,719
- Back in the ship.
- We checked.

846
01:35:19,807 --> 01:35:23,925
I explained we had to lower
my body temperature, so we did.

847
01:35:24,007 --> 01:35:27,716
- We learn from our mistakes.
- I want you to land this helicopter.

848
01:35:28,487 --> 01:35:29,761
Or what?

849
01:35:30,407 --> 01:35:32,716
A gun.

850
01:35:34,087 --> 01:35:36,123
Automatic pilot.

851
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,637
What are you going to do?

852
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:46,278
Do you think that you are capable
of killing your father?

853
01:35:47,127 --> 01:35:49,163
He'd want me to.

854
01:35:49,247 --> 01:35:50,805
Possibly.

855
01:35:50,887 --> 01:35:54,641
But the question is, can you?

856
01:36:04,327 --> 01:36:05,521
Give me...

857
01:36:30,927 --> 01:36:34,158
But you can't win.

858
01:36:48,407 --> 01:36:49,726
Give it up.

859
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,401
Stand back.

860
01:38:15,487 --> 01:38:18,240
You guys come with me.

861
01:38:22,207 --> 01:38:24,084
Dad?

862
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:26,635
Come on, man. Don't do this to me.

863
01:38:26,727 --> 01:38:29,082
Don't do this to me! Dad!

864
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:32,842
Stop shouting, Sam, for God's sake.
You know how much I hate it.

865
01:38:32,927 --> 01:38:36,158
I got it. I got it.

866
01:38:41,247 --> 01:38:44,523
I can't believe you actually shot me.

867
01:38:44,607 --> 01:38:46,006
What would you have done?

868
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:48,442
I would have shot you, of course,
but...

869
01:38:48,527 --> 01:38:51,121
I never dreamed
you were that kind of man.

870
01:38:54,367 --> 01:38:57,006
Get outta here, Sam. I'm fine.

871
01:38:57,847 --> 01:39:01,203
- It's OK, I'm going with you.
- No. Take her for a cup of coffee.

872
01:39:01,287 --> 01:39:03,926
Exercise a fantasy.

873
01:39:04,727 --> 01:39:05,796
OK, Dad.

874
01:39:10,287 --> 01:39:12,755
That was the last one.

875
01:39:14,887 --> 01:39:16,878
You don't know that.

876
01:39:18,527 --> 01:39:21,041
- Yes, I do.
- Excuse me.

877
01:39:29,447 --> 01:39:31,517
Have a good time.

878
01:39:40,927 --> 01:39:43,521
I guess you exobiologists
finally earned your keep.

879
01:39:43,607 --> 01:39:45,325
Yeah, I guess.

880
01:39:53,567 --> 01:39:55,876
When I was inside that thing,

881
01:39:55,967 --> 01:39:59,437
it was like hearing a thousand voices
inside my head.

882
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:02,557
Yeah, I know.

883
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,123
You were there.

884
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,880
Your memories, your thoughts,
feelings.

885
01:40:12,727 --> 01:40:15,400
Everything you try to hide
from yourself.

886
01:40:18,127 --> 01:40:20,197
Yeah.

887
01:40:36,167 --> 01:40:38,806
I guess you know how I feel
about you, then.

888
01:40:42,367 --> 01:40:44,961
Down to the last gory detail.

889
01:40:46,447 --> 01:40:49,962
- Gives you an unfair advantage.
- Why's that?

890
01:40:50,047 --> 01:40:53,005
It would take me forever
to learn that much about you.

891
01:40:53,087 --> 01:40:55,396
No, I think actually it helps us.

892
01:40:55,487 --> 01:40:58,320
If you look at it
from a sociological point of view,

893
01:40:58,407 --> 01:41:02,195
you could argue that men take a lot
longer to open up than women do.

894
01:41:02,287 --> 01:41:07,202
So you should be right on track
in about 40 or 50 years.
