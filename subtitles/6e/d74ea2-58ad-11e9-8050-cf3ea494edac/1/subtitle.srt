1
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:53,712
Now, on the day I was born

2
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,050
The nurses all gathered round

3
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,158
And they gazed in wild wonder

4
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,686
At the joy they had found

5
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,863
The head nurse spoke up

6
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:05,172
Said leave this one alone

7
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,476
She could tell right away

8
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,000
That l was bad to the bone

9
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:12,179
Bad to the bone

10
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,880
B-B-B-B-B-Bad

11
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:23,926
Bad to the bone

12
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:26,299
l broke 1,000 hearts

13
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,276
Before l met you

14
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:30,456
I’ll break 1,000 more, baby

15
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:33,049
Before l am through

16
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,260
I want to be yours, pretty baby

17
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,469
Yours, and yours alone!

18
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,840
I’m here to tell you, honey

19
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:42,362
That I’m bad to the bone

20
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:44,672
Bad to the bone

21
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,595
B-B-B-B-B-Bad

22
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:53,670
Bad to the bone

23
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,908
I’m a-gonna tell you
how it’s gonna be

24
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,522
You gonna give
your love to me

25
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,804
My love is bigger
than the Cadillac

26
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,381
After l show you I’ll be back

27
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,960
Your love for me
has got to be real

28
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,137
Holy shit!

29
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,766
Come on, Arnie.

30
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,783
He’s coming.
He’s changing his shirt.

31
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:33,104
That’s noise pollution,
what you’re doing.

32
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:39,957
You might as well be dumping
toxic waste on our lawn.

33
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:42,996
Hey, Dennis.
I’ll be right there.

34
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,306
Just leave it.
It’s okay.

35
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,381
Go on. It’s okay.

36
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:49,310
Arnie, your lunch!

37
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,791
Try and keep it cold.
There’s yogurt in there.

38
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:54,839
Right.

39
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:05,566
Slow down!

40
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:13,633
Are you guys having a war?

41
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:17,501
She’s pissed off
‘cause I’m taking shop. My dad too.

42
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:21,156
It won’t embarrass them when you
fix their stupid Volvo for free.

43
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:23,081
- What?
- Last night, we’re playing Scrabble.

44
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:25,864
It’s neck-and-neck between me and her.
We blew my dad away early.

45
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:30,188
So, at the end, l had this choice
of ‘‘ratio’’ for five lousy points...

46
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:32,292
- or...
- Or what, Arnie?

47
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:35,464
‘‘tellatio’’ for 24 points
and the game.

48
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:38,252
- What’d she do?
- She won by seven points...

49
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:40,392
because obscenity’s not allowed
in Scrabble.

50
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:45,221
- And it’s in the dictionary!
- You jerk, Arnie. Jesus.

51
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,376
You know, Arnie,
I was thinking--

52
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,353
Uh-oh.

53
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,316
No, seriously.

54
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,993
Now that we’re gonna be seniors,
I figure it’s about time...

55
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:00,589
that we got you laid.

56
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:04,623
- You know, like this year, huh?
- You need a girl to get laid.

57
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:09,902
- What about Gail Justin?
- I don’t like her moustache.

58
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:13,655
Fuck you! What do you care?
if you get a little hair in your mouth?

59
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:19,609
Okay. How about Sally Hayes?
She’s cute.

60
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:22,492
- She’s a sophomore!
- So what? She’s a walking sperm bank.

61
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:24,411
I know. Come on.

62
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,576
I don’t have the minimum deposit
to open an account.

63
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:31,673
Are you kidding? You carry
your life savings between your legs.

64
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:34,904
Come on, Arnie.

65
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,832
I think maybe
I’ll just beat off.

66
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:46,621
Are you playing
football this year or what?

67
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,635
Somebody’s got to pick it up
when you fumble.

68
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,946
- Hey, Terry.
- How’s your gimpy knee?

69
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,087
It’s better.
Coach wants me to practice.

70
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,957
Yeah? It’s about time. I’ve been eatin’
dirt with your name on it for weeks.

71
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,223
Hi, Dennis.

72
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:04,835
Oh, hey, Roseanne.
How you doing?

73
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:09,097
I’m okay. They gonna
let you play football?

74
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:10,244
Yeah.

75
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,204
Doc says I’m as good as new.

76
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,779
Then I guess
I’ll be seeing you out there.

77
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,402
I hope so.

78
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,063
Well, T.T.F.N.

79
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:25,198
Yeah. Ta-ta for now.

80
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:32,818
I wouldn’t put that in my mouth.

81
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:34,739
- You don’t know where it’s been.
- Get outta here.

82
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,969
But we know where it hasn’t been.
With you.

83
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:40,526
- Having trouble with your locker?
- No.

84
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:43,381
- Did you see the new girl?
- I just got here!

85
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:48,270
- I’m in love, and I’m fussy.
- I never noticed you were fussy.

86
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:49,871
Drop dead, Cunningham.

87
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:52,116
- What’s her name?
- I don’t know. She’s in the office.

88
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:56,016
She looks smart,
but she’s got a slut’s body.

89
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,179
Oh, shit. Here she comes.

90
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:02,620
I think you’ll like it here, Leigh.

91
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:04,757
Give me something
for my lap.

92
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:09,752
We have a good band. Went to the Rose
Parade. Not a bad way to meet boys.

93
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:11,711
I would like to get involved
with the yearbook.

94
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:15,551
We have a terrific yearbook staff.
Won a prize last year.

95
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:20,026
So, what about admitting
Red China into the U. N.?

96
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,401
- I think we already did that.
- Yeah, but...

97
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:25,337
do you think it was a good idea?

98
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:28,256
She smiled at me.

99
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,424
I want to have deep,
meaningful sex with her.

100
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:34,342
- Go get her, Bemis.
- Think l should?

101
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:37,091
You’ve got nothing
to lose but your virginity.

102
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:42,341
Dennis, can you give me a hand?

103
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,192
- I can’t--
- Yeah.

104
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:47,877
- He doesn’t have a chance.
- I don’t think so either.

105
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:51,145
She’s much too classy for him.

106
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,449
- There you go.
- What did you do?

107
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,656
Lucky. See you at lunch.

108
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,186
Hey, Charley.
Have you seen Arnie?

109
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,121
- Yeah. He’s still in the shop.
- What’s the matter?

110
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:16,530
Buddy Repperton has his lunch.

111
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:18,452
- Buddy Repperton.
- Hi, Dennis--

112
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,374
Come on, pizza face.

113
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:31,572
You want it?
Come get it!

114
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:34,806
If it’s yours,
why isn’t your name on here anywhere?

115
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:36,401
‘‘Arnie Cuntingham.’’

116
00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:40,434
Why doesn’t it say Cuntingham?

117
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:42,167
Just take it, and let’s go eat.

118
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,117
That’s all you got to do.
Come on.

119
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,153
That’s funny, Buddy,
real funny.

120
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,968
Go get Mr. Casey.

121
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,666
Come on.
You want to go for it?

122
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:24,489
Put the knife down.

123
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:27,238
- Put down the knife.
- You want to make me?

124
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:31,750
You’ve got a knife and he doesn’t.
That makes you a chicken shit.

125
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,570
- Yeah. That’s chicken shit.
- Yeah?

126
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:37,256
- Put it down.
- Yeah, put down the knife.

127
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:39,181
Put down the knife, okay?

128
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,251
Get him, man!

129
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,487
How do you like that, dickface?

130
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:23,321
All right, break it up!
Right now.

131
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,877
You kids take a walk.
Get lost.

132
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,378
Not you, Moochie.

133
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:30,422
- I ain’t been doing nothing.
- You all right, Dennis?

134
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,239
Yeah, I’m okay.

135
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,351
Real cute.
Three on one.

136
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,089
They started it.

137
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,552
- That’s not true.
- Shut up, cuntface!

138
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:48,122
Shut your mouth!

139
00:12:48,196 --> 00:12:51,361
I don’t have to listen
to garbage like that, Buddy!

140
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:57,052
What were you saying?

141
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,590
Repperton’s got a knife.

142
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:00,257
You fucking liar!

143
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:03,493
It’s a switchblade.

144
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:07,140
That’s bullshit, Mr. Casey.
He’s lying. I swear to God.

145
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:12,391
Did Repperton here
pull a knife on you?

146
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,025
Yeah.

147
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:24,202
Empty your pockets, Buddy.

148
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:29,030
Fuck l will.
You can’t make me.

149
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:32,270
If you mean l don’t have the authority,
you’re wrong.

150
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:35,339
Try it, you bald fuck, and I’ll
knock you through the wall! Fuck!

151
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,435
You two boys go up to the office.
Stay there.

152
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:46,739
Don’t go anywhere.
You’ve got enough trouble.

153
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,685
Now...

154
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:54,008
if you don’t empty your pockets
right now, I’m gonna call the cops.

155
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:07,026
Go to the office, Buddy.

156
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:14,847
I’ll fix you!

157
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,385
You’re gonna wish you were
never fucking born!

158
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:35,101
So, all in all,
it wasn’t a bad first day.

159
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,455
Think Repperton
will try to get even?

160
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:42,594
No, he’s a douche bag.

161
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:45,186
He’ll find somebody
else to pick on.

162
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:48,160
- They kicked him out, you know.
- Good.

163
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:50,307
They kick Moochie out?

164
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,420
Probation.

165
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,347
Those assholes.

166
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:58,570
Stop the car! Quick!
Go back!

167
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:00,581
- What’s the matter?
- I want to look at her!

168
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:02,729
- All right, Arnie.
- Just go back. All right?

169
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,655
Jesus Christ.

170
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:13,618
What is it?

171
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,325
Do you know someone who lives here?

172
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:26,325
What?

173
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,160
Jesus.

174
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,614
Be careful, Dennis.

175
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:57,662
- This is a piece of shit.
- She could be fixed up.

176
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:00,512
- Yeah.
- Oh, she could be really tough.

177
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,209
Forget it. This baby’s got
93,000 miles on it.

178
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:12,349
Probably 193.

179
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:14,310
I don’t care.

180
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,637
- I bet it won’t even start.
- She’ll start.

181
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:20,519
You need these.

182
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:28,867
How much do you want for her?

183
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:32,169
- Whatever it is, it’s not enough.
- Jesus, Arnie.

184
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,535
Sonny, you ever owned a car before?

185
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:49,162
- Yeah, he owns a Mustang--
- No. l just got my license.

186
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,585
Name’s George LeBay.

187
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,528
Arnie Cunningham.
What are you asking?

188
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:58,899
Start her up.

189
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,196
Really?

190
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,127
Her name’s Christine.

191
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,321
I like that.

192
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,909
Come on. We gotta get going.

193
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:21,014
My asshole brother
bought her in September, ‘57.

194
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:24,249
You got your new model year
in September.

195
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,739
Brand-new, she was.

196
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:29,564
She had the smell
of a brand-new car.

197
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,821
About the finest smell in the world,
except maybe for pussy.

198
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:38,521
When he got her,
she had six miles on the odometer.

199
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:42,656
Goddamn Roland went through hell
and back with Christine.

200
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,909
If your brother loves this car so much,
why is he selling it?

201
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,227
‘Cause he’s stone cold dead.

202
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:53,789
Died six weeks ago.

203
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:56,995
So, Mr. LeBay...

204
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,624
how much do you want for her?

205
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:01,315
I’ve been asking 300.

206
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,325
I’ll make it 250 for you.

207
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:07,809
250? This isn’t worth 50 bucks.

208
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:10,982
The money’s not important,
and there’ll be no bringing her back...

209
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,353
‘cause I’m selling this shit hole
and buying me a condo.

210
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,331
You got a deal.

211
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,740
I’ll get the pink slip.

212
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:24,740
WiIl you stop and think about this
for a moment?

213
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,086
- Where are you getting the money?
- I’ve been saving all summer.

214
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:30,121
- For college.
- You already have a car.

215
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,950
He’s screwing you.

216
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:34,288
You could get a decent car
for that much money.

217
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:36,941
Christine is decent.

218
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,922
The guy’s weird, Arnie.

219
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:40,972
He’s fucking weird.

220
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:44,559
- So that was 300?
- Yeah, that’s it.

221
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,414
- You said 250.
- 250 would do it.

222
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:51,474
It this is a good idea,
let’s just come back tomorrow.

223
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,203
Do you realize
she’s 20 years old?

224
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:56,689
I mean, that makes her
officially an antique.

225
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:01,041
Great. DarneIl’s junkyard
is full of official antiques.

226
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:04,183
I’m buying her.
I don’t care what you say.

227
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,141
It’s your funeral, man.

228
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:15,711
Would you give
Arnie a break?

229
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,686
He doesn’t know what he’s doing.

230
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,530
You don’t know half as much
as you think you do...

231
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,294
shitter.

232
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:27,616
You did what?

233
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:31,230
- She’s outside.
- You’re kidding, right?

234
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:34,848
You can’t buy a car.
What are you talking about?

235
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:38,235
- You’re 17 years old.
- Oh, boy.

236
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,003
Actually, you’re wrong.

237
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:43,870
I couldn’t finance it,
but buying it for cash is no problem.

238
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:47,143
Registering a car at 17
is something else...

239
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:49,447
and for that
I need your permission.

240
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,654
You know how we do things.

241
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,280
You could’ve consulted with us.

242
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:59,173
I’ve consulted with you
about every damn thing I’ve ever done.

243
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:03,077
If it’s something l want,
I get outvoted, two to one!

244
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:05,520
This is no committee meeting.
I bought the car, and that’s it!

245
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:09,545
It most certainly
is not it!

246
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:12,847
How could you have
let him do this?

247
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:16,493
I didn’t let him.
He wanted the car, and he bought it.

248
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:20,048
I tried to talk him out of it.

249
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:23,501
I doubt you tried very hard.

250
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:27,187
- Yeah, well, I’m going home.
- I think you should.

251
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:29,110
That’s it. I’m getting
the fuck out of here.

252
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:32,559
- What kind of lang--
- What did you say!

253
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:38,354
You wanted me in college courses.
I’m there.

254
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:41,275
You wanted chess club instead of band.
I’m there too.

255
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,400
I’ve managed 1 7 years without
embarrassing you or landing in jail.

256
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:48,251
I’m gonna have this one thing!

257
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:53,272
You are not keeping
any car at this house.

258
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:54,837
Fine!

259
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:03,163
Thanks for the milk.

260
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:45,384
- What’s the problem?
- Could you honk your horn for me?

261
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:47,846
Christine’s doesn’t
seem to work.

262
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,776
- Ah. Sure.
- Thanks.

263
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:23,739
Stall 20.

264
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,086
Get it over there
and shut it off...

265
00:22:28,158 --> 00:22:30,362
before we all
choke to death.

266
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,141
Kiddo, if you sold him that piece of
shit, you ought to be fuckin’ ashamed.

267
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:40,119
I didn’t sell it to him.
I tried to talk him out of it.

268
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,266
You should have tried harder.

269
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:58,916
I knew a guy who had
a car like that once.

270
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:01,734
Fuckin’ bastard
killed himself in it.

271
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,656
Son of a bitch was so mean...

272
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:05,794
if you poured boiling water
down his throat...

273
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:08,965
he would have pissed ice cubes.

274
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:12,647
Okay.
That’s the last time...

275
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:15,848
you run that mechanical asshole
in here without an exhaust hose.

276
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,635
I catch you doin’ it one time,
and you’re out. You understand?

277
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:22,022
- Huh?
- Yes.

278
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:24,462
I’m gonna tell you
something else right now.

279
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,361
I don’t take any shit
from you kids.

280
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:32,460
This place is for working stiffs,
gotta keep their cars runnin’.

281
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,793
It’s not for rich-assed, snot-nosed kids
draggin’ on the Orange Belt.

282
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:39,821
I don’t allow no smoking in here
neither. You go out in the junkyard.

283
00:23:39,892 --> 00:23:43,276
- I don’t smoke.
- Don’t interrupt me, punk.

284
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,100
Don’t interrupt me.
Don’t get smart.

285
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:49,366
- Ah, sir?
- What?

286
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:54,999
Those men over there are smoking.
Better tell them to stop.

287
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:59,634
You trying to help your buddy
right out of here, Chuck?

288
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:07,545
Then shut your pie hole.

289
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,501
I know a creep when I see one.

290
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,137
I think I’m looking
at one right now.

291
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,769
You’re on probation.
You get it?

292
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:21,565
You screw around with me...

293
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,609
I don’t care how much money
you paid up in front...

294
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:27,546
I’ll throw you out
on your ass! You got it?

295
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,435
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,061
Good.

297
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:37,734
Now get the hell out of here.
We’re closed.

298
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:57,132
You gonna be okay?

299
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,421
Yeah. I’m okay.

300
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,860
You know, you better find yourself some
other charity besides me and Christine.

301
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,143
What is it about that car?

302
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,211
I don’t know.

303
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:25,717
Maybe it’s just that for the first time
I’ve found something uglier than me.

304
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,581
And I know I can fix her up.

305
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:31,511
You’re not ugly, Arnie.

306
00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:35,415
I know what I am.

307
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:38,937
Queer, maybe, but not ugly.

308
00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:41,681
Fuck you.

309
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:51,577
Oh, bug out, Dennis.
You don’t need this shit.

310
00:26:00,705 --> 00:26:03,292
Where have you been?
You had us worried sick!

311
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:05,982
You don’t just up and drive off
whenever you--

312
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:21,472
As l walk along l wonder

313
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:26,085
What went wrong with our love

314
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:28,872
A love that was so strong

315
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:46,348
He’s done all this shit
in three weeks.

316
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,581
Look how cockeyed he works.

317
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,846
He’s got fuckin’ brand-new
windshield wipers...

318
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:55,053
for a busted windshield.

319
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:59,151
Well, the boy does
have good hands.

320
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,594
Good hands.

321
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:03,595
Bad taste in cars.

322
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,654
You know, Papa,
you can’t polish a turd.

323
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,580
When l said you could scrounge through
that shit pile out back...

324
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:44,386
I didn’t mean you could build
your whole fuckin’ car with my stuff.

325
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:47,768
What do you care?
You’re not doing anything with it.

326
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:51,553
Hey! Don’t think you
got the gold key to the crapper.

327
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,890
Nobody takes advantage
of me, understand?

328
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:56,836
Yeah.

329
00:27:56,902 --> 00:28:01,376
If it wasn’t for me, it’d cost you
a shit pile to put this heap together.

330
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,822
I know.

331
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:09,802
Look.

332
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:15,271
I know you ain’t got money
falling out of your asshole.

333
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:17,675
If you did,
you wouldn’t be here.

334
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:23,114
Maybe we could work out
some kind of a deal.

335
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:30,990
You...

336
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:33,391
pick up around the place.

337
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,313
Do a few lubes...

338
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:39,278
put the toilet paper
on the little spools...

339
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:41,519
shit like that.

340
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:43,629
Do that and you can--

341
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:48,143
you can raid my junk pile
for whatever you want.

342
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:51,314
I might even throw in
a few bucks.

343
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:55,640
I’ll have to think about it.

344
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:59,503
Well, don’t think about it too long!
I’ll throw you out on your fuckin’ ass.

345
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:27,202
Forever, my darling

346
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:31,424
My love will be true

347
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:34,308
Always and forever

348
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:38,629
I’ll love just you

349
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:43,138
Just promise me, darling

350
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:48,516
Your love in return

351
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,783
May this fire in my soul, dear

352
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,293
Forever burn

353
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:03,052
My heart’s at your command, dear

354
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,152
I’ll bet you a dollar
she says no.

355
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:09,072
Just ‘cause she shot you down?

356
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:11,788
She says no to everybody.

357
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:21,803
Look what she’s doing
to that pencil.

358
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:24,496
I wish l was an eraser.

359
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,007
Go on, studley.
Ask her out.

360
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:32,341
Mind your own business.
Just read the book.

361
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:36,118
Yeah. Come on.
Just don’t tip the table over.

362
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:35,498
What are you reading?

363
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,396
- History.
- Oh.

364
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:43,432
- It’s pretty boring, huh?
- Yeah.

365
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:45,194
Listen, do you like music?

366
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:51,019
What about dancing?

367
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,682
Yes.

368
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:56,142
Do you think you might...

369
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,512
want to go dancing with me...

370
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,842
like maybe this Friday night
after the game?

371
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:04,460
I’m sorry. I can’t.

372
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:17,205
Why not?

373
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,144
I have a date.

374
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:24,824
Mr. Gilder! Are you lost?

375
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,211
No, ma’am.

376
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:31,101
Why don’t you return to your own seat
and get back to work.

377
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:33,756
Yeah.

378
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:58,593
Arnie, stay here
so we can talk this over.

379
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:02,111
Mister, this is not a hotel
you can just drop into.

380
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:04,094
- I don’t need this.
- What do you need?

381
00:33:04,168 --> 00:33:08,196
- I need to leave. I’m late.
- You come back here this instant.

382
00:33:10,762 --> 00:33:12,421
Oh, shit.

383
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,858
Greetings to you too.

384
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:20,457
Hey, man, no glasses.
You’re lookin’ good.

385
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:23,461
I can’t make it.
I meant to call you, but l forgot.

386
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:28,647
Is Dennis going with you?

387
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,104
- Are you going with him?
- Am l?

388
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,080
No. I’ve gotta do an errand
for Darnell.

389
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:38,188
- You need a ride?
- Got his car. Thanks, though.

390
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:40,845
I’m sorry about the movie,
but this is work. Gotta go.

391
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:45,772
- Don’t worry about it.
- Did you have plans with Dennis?

392
00:33:47,062 --> 00:33:52,181
You are going to have no friends at all
if you keep treating people this way.

393
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:53,655
Get off my back!

394
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:00,345
You’re his best friend.
What’s going on?

395
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:07,506
I don’t know.
I hardly see him anymore.

396
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:11,292
Neither do we.

397
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,621
Ever since he bought that car
he’s been obsessed with it.

398
00:34:17,695 --> 00:34:20,151
And you know what else?

399
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,462
When we signed the registration papers
at Town Hall...

400
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:28,157
they told us the man
who owned that car last...

401
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:31,262
died in it
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

402
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,636
Jesus.
Does Arnie know about that?

403
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:42,946
Arnie doesn’t know anything anymore.

404
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,147
What the hell do you want?

405
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,108
I know about your brother.

406
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:05,767
I know he died
choking on exhaust fumes.

407
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,328
You don’t know shit, kid.

408
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,784
My brother died
‘cause he wanted to.

409
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:13,995
He ran a rubber hose
from the exhaust pipe.

410
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:16,936
Arnie wouldn’t have bought it
if he’d known somebody died in it.

411
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:20,946
Either you’re dumb or you
don’t know your friend very well.

412
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:24,464
He had the same look
my brother always had.

413
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:30,380
Probably the only thing my brother
ever loved in his life was that car.

414
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:35,061
No shitter ever came between him
and Christine. If they did, watch out.

415
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:40,534
His five-year-old daughter choked to
death in it. He wouldn’t get rid of it.

416
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:44,466
He rode around without a care
in the world except for Christine.

417
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:49,077
Only time l ever interfered
was when Rita killed herself.

418
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:52,598
- Who’s Rita?
- His wife!

419
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,059
He didn’t care
a rat’s ass about her.

420
00:35:55,134 --> 00:35:57,306
She died the same way he did.

421
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:00,126
Then l made him get rid of it.

422
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:03,706
For decency, you know.

423
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:05,917
Of course, the car came back
three weeks later.

424
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:07,897
What do you mean, ‘‘came back’’?

425
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:14,643
Keep a-knockin’, but you can’t come in

426
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:22,774
Come back tomorrow night
and try it again

427
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:25,561
You said you loved me
and you can’t come in

428
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:27,483
You said you loved me

429
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,410
All right. Fifty.
Pass on go.

430
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:11,337
Ready?

431
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:14,918
Want me to go deep or flat?

432
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:17,857
Flat. I’ll hit you
on the second shot comin’ around.

433
00:38:30,896 --> 00:38:32,424
Hey, Trelawney.

434
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:35,759
- Is that Cuntingham’s car?
- Yep.

435
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,769
I know where he keeps it.

436
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:57,839
Down...

437
00:38:57,913 --> 00:38:59,474
set, go!

438
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:31,107
Fucking shit!

439
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:43,582
Get a stretcher!
Come on!

440
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:42,804
"5,000 Dirty Limericks."

441
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:47,447
Ought to keep you busy for a while.

442
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:50,332
This is the third time
I’ve come by.

443
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:54,108
Must be dynamite drugs.
You’re always asleep.

444
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:56,029
Doesn’t quite kill the pain.

445
00:40:57,951 --> 00:41:01,564
Rockbridge hasn’t won a game
since you got hurt.

446
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:03,356
That makes you a hero, right?

447
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:08,827
Did l tell you that I’m not gonna
be playing football again? Ever.

448
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:14,588
The doctor said that
one centimeter more...

449
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:17,596
and l would have been paralyzed
from the waist down.

450
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,857
Shitters did some job on you, huh?

451
00:41:24,136 --> 00:41:26,984
So what’s this
about you and Leigh Cabot?

452
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:33,960
- We like each other okay.
- Ho-ho. Listen to Mr. Cool.

453
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:37,256
She just happens to be
the most beautiful girl in the school.

454
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:41,635
Well, it’s not what you think.
l really...

455
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,684
respect her mind.

456
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:45,963
She lusts after my body.
What can I say?

457
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:47,406
Fuck you.

458
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:52,778
l saw you guys at the football game.

459
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,319
How’d you ever get that car
tixed up like that?

460
00:41:57,394 --> 00:42:01,552
Oh, just plain
old-fashioned hard work.

461
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:04,586
l still can’t keep her at home.

462
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,149
Mom says it makes
the yard look crowded.

463
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:10,354
I’m surprised they let you register it.

464
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:12,944
l told them it they didn’t,
I’d drop school.

465
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:15,089
Are you serious?

466
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,257
They just don’t want me to grow up
because they’d have to face getting old.

467
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:36,696
Has it ever occurred to you...

468
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:39,964
that part of being a parent...

469
00:42:40,031 --> 00:42:42,137
is trying to kill your kids?

470
00:42:45,185 --> 00:42:47,095
See you around, pal.

471
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:38,216
I’m sorry, Arnie. l can’t.

472
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:02,161
What’s the matter?
What’s wrong?

473
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,546
l can’t. Here.

474
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:11,644
that car.

475
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,710
What are you talking about?
Why not?

476
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:19,352
‘Cause l hate that car.

477
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,840
You care more about that car
than me.

478
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:27,928
That’s crazy, Leigh.

479
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:29,858
Who do you spend
more time with?

480
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:37,856
Look--
You’re gonna get a cold. Come on.

481
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:06,537
I thought girls are supposed to
be jealous of other girls, not cars.

482
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:09,422
This car’s a girl.

483
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:10,982
Oh, please.

484
00:45:15,185 --> 00:45:16,908
Cut it out. Don’t.

485
00:45:16,977 --> 00:45:20,940
What? You don’t like me
slapping your girl?

486
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,617
It seems like nobody
likes my car these days.

487
00:45:55,391 --> 00:45:57,049
Oh, shit!

488
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,394
You’re mine

489
00:46:12,324 --> 00:46:15,140
And we belong

490
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,850
Together

491
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:23,970
Yes, we belong together

492
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:37,889
Yes, it belongs to only me

493
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:02,602
What the hell
are you doing?

494
00:47:02,676 --> 00:47:05,644
Get your goddamn
hands off her!

495
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,281
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

496
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:40,920
You gonna be all right?

497
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,739
Yeah, I’m fine now.

498
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:46,079
You scared the hell out of me.

499
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:48,121
Then get rid of that car.

500
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:52,536
I’m not going in it again.

501
00:47:52,612 --> 00:47:56,323
Wait a minute. Don’t you blame
your choking on Christine.

502
00:47:56,389 --> 00:47:58,244
It happened, Arnie.

503
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,856
When l choked, something happened.
The radio came on.

504
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:06,051
- Everything got bright.
- So, what are you saying?

505
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:09,925
l could’ve died,
and you couldn’t even help.

506
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:11,936
My door was locked.

507
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,898
You didn’t want that man
to help me either!

508
00:48:13,962 --> 00:48:17,379
l thought he was attacking you!
l could have done the Heimlich maneuver.

509
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:18,858
But you didn’t.

510
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:23,845
There are other things.
That radio.

511
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:27,405
All it gets is those old songs.

512
00:48:27,473 --> 00:48:29,447
Sometimes when we’re making out...

513
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,519
it just stalls.

514
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:34,445
As if the car
were jealous, Arnie.

515
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:37,700
A goddamn car!

516
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,434
I’ll get it.

517
00:48:43,436 --> 00:48:45,345
Know what l think?

518
00:48:45,419 --> 00:48:48,168
l think you’re just
sexually frustrated.

519
00:48:57,928 --> 00:48:59,650
I’m sorry, okay?

520
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:04,095
Can l at least call you tomorrow?

521
00:49:12,356 --> 00:49:14,210
l don’t know.

522
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:41,529
Come on.

523
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,904
Come on, baby, please.

524
00:49:53,976 --> 00:49:56,877
It’s all right.
Everything is the same.

525
00:50:01,941 --> 00:50:04,307
l love you like I do

526
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,854
Don’t know why I love you

527
00:50:11,923 --> 00:50:14,344
Don’t know why I care

528
00:50:18,896 --> 00:50:23,335
l wonder why I love you like l do

529
00:50:23,406 --> 00:50:25,097
Is it because

530
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,686
l know you love me too

531
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:54,708
Check this out!

532
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,658
Keep a-knockin’,
but you can’t come in

533
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:09,271
I’ll just be a second. l just have to
get my wallet out of Christine.

534
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,373
Want to come in with me?

535
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,964
Please.

536
00:53:31,865 --> 00:53:35,541
You know, I’ve been thinking.

537
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:38,062
Maybe we should apply
to the same colleges next year.

538
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:43,339
- Really?
- Yeah.

539
00:53:43,413 --> 00:53:45,420
lf we get accepted
by the same schools...

540
00:53:45,493 --> 00:53:49,747
we could take it as a sign of fate.

541
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:52,909
You’d have me to help you
through math, and if--

542
00:53:55,474 --> 00:53:58,408
Arnie, what’s wrong?

543
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,849
Who did this?

544
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,405
Don’t touch me, shitter!
This is just what you wanted!

545
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,548
You get away from her!

546
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:19,993
Arnie, I’m sorry.

547
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:24,048
Sorry?

548
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,494
Yes.

549
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:30,158
l--
That is, we--

550
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,856
It’s your fault.

551
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:37,586
lf you hadn’t been so damn selfish that
you wouldn’t let me park my own car...

552
00:55:37,653 --> 00:55:39,888
in your precious driveway,
this never would have happened.

553
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:42,377
That’s not fair.

554
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,654
Oh, it’s fair.

555
00:55:46,578 --> 00:55:49,577
Can’t we even talk about this...

556
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:51,503
like rational human beings?

557
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:54,154
One of them took a shit
on the dashboard of my car, Ma.

558
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:56,460
How’s that for rational, huh?

559
00:56:00,047 --> 00:56:01,834
Why don’t we--

560
00:56:04,076 --> 00:56:06,978
Your mother and l have decided
to help you buy a new car.

561
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:14,751
Well, that’s what
everybody wants, isn’t it?

562
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,634
Well, fuck you.

563
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:21,151
I’m fixing up Christine.

564
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:31,580
Listen, mister, you’ve been
disrespectful to us once too often!

565
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:33,954
You apologize to your mother
right now!

566
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,191
Take your mitts off me, motherfucker!

567
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,199
I’m hittin’ the sack.

568
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:16,910
We’ll make it better, huh?

569
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:20,339
Can’t hurt us anymore...

570
00:57:21,845 --> 00:57:23,700
not if we work together.

571
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:28,659
We’ll show those shitters
what we can do.

572
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:15,742
Show me.

573
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:15,970
Little bitty pretty one

574
01:00:16,036 --> 01:00:18,011
Come on, come to me

575
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:20,953
Lovey dovey, lovely one

576
01:00:21,027 --> 01:00:23,447
Until I’m on my knees

577
01:00:55,609 --> 01:00:57,365
Is that you, Cunningham?

578
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,274
Hey, you ain’t mad, are ya?

579
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,526
Oh, shit.

580
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:58,389
You’re a dead man now!

581
01:03:43,336 --> 01:03:44,862
Where have you been?

582
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,476
You hear about
what happened to Moochie?

583
01:03:50,918 --> 01:03:52,445
Yeah.

584
01:03:54,757 --> 01:03:57,691
Almost makes you feel sorry
for the little bastard.

585
01:04:04,162 --> 01:04:05,755
How’s Christine coming?

586
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:07,418
Oh, cherry.

587
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:10,652
l spent a shitload of money on her,
and she’s perfecto now.

588
01:04:12,992 --> 01:04:15,096
That’s funny, you know, ‘cause...

589
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,022
l heard she was totaled.

590
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:21,752
After l cleaned up the broken glass,
it wasn’t so bad.

591
01:04:26,236 --> 01:04:28,090
l bet you a hundred bucks...

592
01:04:29,434 --> 01:04:31,343
it was Buddy Repperton.

593
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:34,008
Maybe.

594
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:39,092
So what if you fix it up and he
just comes back and does it again?

595
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:41,102
He won’t do it again.

596
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,169
What does that mean?

597
01:04:45,238 --> 01:04:47,571
Man, l gotta go.

598
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:51,182
l hope you didn’t think
l could hang around here all day.

599
01:04:51,252 --> 01:04:53,805
Yeah, that’s you, Arnie,
always in demand.

600
01:04:55,443 --> 01:04:56,817
Stay loose.

601
01:04:59,571 --> 01:05:01,097
You know it.

602
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,607
Happy Thanksgiving.

603
01:05:20,365 --> 01:05:22,437
Lean machine.

604
01:05:23,756 --> 01:05:25,129
They let you out early?

605
01:05:26,794 --> 01:05:28,223
Yeah, that’s right.

606
01:05:30,633 --> 01:05:33,666
I’m Rudolph Junkins,
State Police, Detective.

607
01:05:33,736 --> 01:05:36,452
I’m just missing a study hall.
l got to get to work.

608
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,236
l don’t care about that.
l want to ask you about your car.

609
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:43,677
You do nice body work.
l thought this thing was totaled.

610
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:47,171
- Who told you that?
- Why, hell, everybody.

611
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:50,650
Local police, your mom and dad,
your girl. Cute girl, by the way.

612
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:54,367
It wasn’t as bad as it looked.

613
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:59,648
The report said
they punched holes in the body.

614
01:05:59,713 --> 01:06:01,568
Damned if l can see the fill.

615
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:03,737
You can if you look.

616
01:06:03,808 --> 01:06:06,262
It’s right over there...

617
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:08,407
and back here.

618
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:11,958
I’ve been lucky with parts.
l replaced the entire door on this side.

619
01:06:12,029 --> 01:06:14,679
- Yeah?
- See where the paint doesn’t match?

620
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:20,857
Nope. A hell of a job, Arnie.

621
01:06:20,923 --> 01:06:22,613
WelI, thank you very much.

622
01:06:48,435 --> 01:06:50,191
So what do you want?

623
01:06:50,258 --> 01:06:53,999
l really like this shade of red.
Didn’t think they made this anymore.

624
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:56,170
Do they still make this shade?

625
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:58,924
Well, they must.
l bought it, didn’t l?

626
01:06:58,993 --> 01:07:02,407
- Where?
- Baker Auto out on Route 5.

627
01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:06,698
- You still got the receipt?
- Tossed it out.

628
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:13,512
You know, it’s funny--
Cigarette?

629
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,172
No, thanks.

630
01:07:15,243 --> 01:07:18,276
Usually when somebody trashes a car,
we get photographs.

631
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:21,509
Wait. They didn’t really trash it.

632
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:23,617
That’s not what Leigh said.

633
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:26,754
She was so shaken up,
giving me all the details...

634
01:07:26,824 --> 01:07:28,416
she broke down crying.

635
01:07:28,487 --> 01:07:30,374
I understand...

636
01:07:31,878 --> 01:07:35,903
one of the perpetrators
defecated on the dashboard.

637
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:38,590
l would’ve thought you’d
be madder than hell at that...

638
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,409
and l would’ve thought
you would’ve reported that.

639
01:07:42,244 --> 01:07:44,283
Shit wipes off.

640
01:07:45,538 --> 01:07:48,352
Moochie Welch
kind of got wiped off too.

641
01:07:50,497 --> 01:07:51,871
l don’t know.

642
01:07:51,936 --> 01:07:54,935
- You don’t know?
- No.

643
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:56,469
Scout’s honor?

644
01:07:57,343 --> 01:07:59,197
l’m not a Scout.

645
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:04,184
The kid was cut in half. They had
to scrape his legs up with a shovel.

646
01:08:04,254 --> 01:08:07,067
Isn’t that what you’re supposed
to do with shit...

647
01:08:07,132 --> 01:08:09,237
scrape it up with a shovel?

648
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:12,753
Don’t get smart with me, son.

649
01:08:14,138 --> 01:08:16,855
Your girlfriend is
more convincing than you are.

650
01:08:23,736 --> 01:08:25,742
She’s not my girlfriend.

651
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:29,043
And since when is it against the law
to fix your own car...

652
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:31,313
when somebody else busts it up?

653
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:33,104
Since never.

654
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:35,987
Then you get off my back.

655
01:08:55,662 --> 01:08:58,923
l need to see you.

656
01:09:00,781 --> 01:09:03,082
l care about you.

657
01:09:07,339 --> 01:09:08,931
Look, l love you.

658
01:09:10,922 --> 01:09:13,442
l think we deserve one more try.

659
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:17,120
Don’t you?

660
01:09:17,193 --> 01:09:19,559
Would you give me a yes or no!

661
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:22,437
Please don’t do this to me.

662
01:09:22,502 --> 01:09:25,348
Just be straight with me.
You’ve had it, right?

663
01:09:25,413 --> 01:09:27,039
Well, fuck you, bitch!

664
01:10:11,096 --> 01:10:12,950
Want to do the honors?

665
01:10:15,255 --> 01:10:17,110
I’d love to bring her along.

666
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:18,701
Sure.

667
01:10:18,774 --> 01:10:21,162
- She can earn her way.
- Bullshit.

668
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:22,961
Let’s get Vandenberg.

669
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,378
Baby!

670
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:54,534
I’ll never be your beast of burden

671
01:10:55,628 --> 01:10:59,424
My back is broad
but it’s a-hurtin’

672
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:05,090
All l want is for you
to make love to me

673
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:16,515
I’ve walked for miles

674
01:11:16,582 --> 01:11:18,491
My feet are hurtin’

675
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,587
Asshole.

676
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:27,740
Watch this.

677
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:36,382
Let’s give this asshole
some of his own medicine.

678
01:11:40,895 --> 01:11:42,683
He’s backing up too.

679
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:19,340
Some shithead’s following me!

680
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:22,447
l hope he comes in here!

681
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:52,677
- Is that Cunningham?
- It can’t be.

682
01:12:54,217 --> 01:12:56,104
Look at my car.

683
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:58,885
Come on, prick!
We’re not finished yet.

684
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:01,892
Come on!

685
01:16:06,898 --> 01:16:09,231
Hello, Henry? This is Will.

686
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:11,369
Listen. Cunningham get there?

687
01:16:12,624 --> 01:16:14,478
The order okay?

688
01:16:14,543 --> 01:16:16,103
Good.

689
01:16:16,175 --> 01:16:18,989
Listen. He was driving
my Caddy, wasn’t he?

690
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:22,981
Good. Yes. Take it easy.

691
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:56,994
Okay, Jack. Come on out.

692
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:00,701
The ride is over.

693
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:07,862
lf I’m gonna have to come in
and get ya...

694
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:09,561
I’m gonna get ya.

695
01:17:24,732 --> 01:17:27,699
Why don’t you do us both a favor.

696
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:29,460
Come on out.

697
01:18:31,016 --> 01:18:33,698
l got a girl named Bony Moronie

698
01:18:36,518 --> 01:18:39,332
She’s as skinny
as a stick of macaroni

699
01:18:41,797 --> 01:18:44,961
Oughta see her rock and roll
with her blue jeans on

700
01:18:46,436 --> 01:18:47,865
What?

701
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,785
Not very fat
Just skin and bone

702
01:18:53,505 --> 01:18:56,188
l love her and she loves me

703
01:18:56,257 --> 01:18:58,974
We’re all happy now
as we can be

704
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,625
Makin’ love
underneath the apple tree

705
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:07,606
Well, l told her mama
and her papa too

706
01:19:47,763 --> 01:19:49,616
- What’s goin’ on?
- You tell me.

707
01:19:49,681 --> 01:19:51,536
- Where were you last night?
- Home.

708
01:19:51,601 --> 01:19:54,055
- What are you doing to my car?
- You didn’t go out at all?

709
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:59,083
Of course l went out. l got Darnell’s
car out front with a load of parts.

710
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:01,222
- You want the receipt?
- Yeah.

711
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:12,896
How come you’re showing up just now?

712
01:20:12,971 --> 01:20:15,523
Why didn’t you unload
the stuff last night?

713
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:17,481
Because l was tired, that’s why.

714
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:22,407
lf you don’t believe me,
you can ask my mother.

715
01:20:22,472 --> 01:20:25,287
Why do you keep
butting into my life?

716
01:20:25,352 --> 01:20:29,627
Because we found your boss,
Will Darnell, dead in your front seat...

717
01:20:29,702 --> 01:20:31,741
with a shotgun by his side.

718
01:20:46,914 --> 01:20:50,938
- Why?
- l was hoping you could answer that.

719
01:20:51,008 --> 01:20:54,073
Somebody saw your car cruising
behind Buddy Repperton last night.

720
01:20:54,143 --> 01:20:56,346
He’s dead too.

721
01:20:56,414 --> 01:20:59,545
So are Don Vandenberg
and Richard Trelawney.

722
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:02,933
Guess nobody’ll be trashing
your car anymore.

723
01:21:04,636 --> 01:21:06,840
Well, all l know--

724
01:21:11,226 --> 01:21:12,916
l got a Cadillac full of parts...

725
01:21:12,985 --> 01:21:14,992
and I’m supposed to be
at school in half an hour.

726
01:21:15,065 --> 01:21:18,196
We’ll take care of the Caddy.
l don’t want you touching it.

727
01:21:23,895 --> 01:21:28,302
Honest, l don’t know what’s going on.
l swear l don’t.

728
01:21:33,427 --> 01:21:35,282
May l please speak to Dennis?

729
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:38,472
It’s a girl.

730
01:21:42,545 --> 01:21:43,973
Happy New Year.

731
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,749
Can l come over there?
l need to talk to you.

732
01:21:48,911 --> 01:21:51,528
- What, about Arnie?
- About Christine.

733
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:57,670
You first.

734
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,055
I’m afraid for Arnie.

735
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:05,603
l thought you wanted to talk
about Christine.

736
01:22:05,675 --> 01:22:08,227
What do you know about that car?

737
01:22:09,673 --> 01:22:12,322
l know that the guy
who owned the car before Arnie--

738
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:13,821
Yeah?

739
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:16,481
His daughter choked to death
in Christine.

740
01:22:16,551 --> 01:22:19,038
How do you know that?

741
01:22:19,111 --> 01:22:22,077
LeBay’s brother sold Arnie the car,
and the guy’s a jerk.

742
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:26,272
- He just came out and told me.
- l think l was supposed to be next.

743
01:22:28,932 --> 01:22:30,753
Come on.

744
01:22:33,186 --> 01:22:35,040
Arnie would never do that.

745
01:22:36,545 --> 01:22:38,519
Not in a million years.

746
01:22:42,112 --> 01:22:44,216
l don’t think he’s Arnie.

747
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:50,964
It’s that car.
l swear it’s the car.

748
01:22:51,677 --> 01:22:52,953
Maybe.

749
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:56,570
I’m going to Arnie’s tonight
for New Year’s--

750
01:22:56,636 --> 01:22:59,602
- I wouldn’t.
- It’s okay.

751
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:02,936
We do it every year.
His folks are going to be there.

752
01:23:03,002 --> 01:23:06,231
Maybe if l get him alone,
maybe he’ll talk to me.

753
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:07,671
What if he doesn’t?

754
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:12,561
- What do you mean?
- l don’t know.

755
01:23:12,631 --> 01:23:14,899
What if that car doesn’t let him?

756
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:20,685
Then we destroy it.

757
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:54,305
Well, come on
let’s go

758
01:23:54,379 --> 01:23:57,128
Let’s go, let’s go
little darlin’

759
01:23:57,194 --> 01:24:00,041
And tell me that
you’ll never leave me

760
01:24:00,105 --> 01:24:02,341
Come on, come on

761
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,943
Well, now, swing me, swing me
all the way down there

762
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:09,798
Well, now, swing me, swing me
all the way down there

763
01:24:09,863 --> 01:24:12,611
Come on, let’s go, little darlin’

764
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:15,676
Let’s go again once more

765
01:24:18,084 --> 01:24:21,083
My man, you really operate
on those babies.

766
01:24:22,243 --> 01:24:23,901
Yeah, l manage.

767
01:24:25,091 --> 01:24:27,479
We got the old rust bucket tonight.

768
01:24:27,554 --> 01:24:30,521
You wanna watch what you call my car.

769
01:24:30,593 --> 01:24:32,763
She’s real sensitive.

770
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:35,035
Is she?

771
01:24:36,926 --> 01:24:38,781
Sorry, Christine.

772
01:24:38,846 --> 01:24:40,569
Good boy.

773
01:24:41,854 --> 01:24:43,315
Let’s motorvate.

774
01:25:18,835 --> 01:25:20,689
Have a beer.
Don’t be shy.

775
01:25:20,754 --> 01:25:22,576
My car’s your car.

776
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,627
A toast.

777
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:33,320
Death...

778
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:36,389
to the shitters
of the world in 1979.

779
01:25:37,453 --> 01:25:39,624
Come on.
l can’t drink to that.

780
01:25:40,876 --> 01:25:42,883
What can you drink to?

781
01:25:42,956 --> 01:25:45,857
What about to us?
You know, to friendship?

782
01:25:45,931 --> 01:25:49,825
Oh, friendship. Right.
That’s real good.

783
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,415
Come on!

784
01:26:12,482 --> 01:26:14,751
l want you to see this.

785
01:26:14,818 --> 01:26:18,494
This is great alignment.
You just don’t see this anymore.

786
01:26:25,152 --> 01:26:26,745
Don’t be scared.

787
01:26:28,991 --> 01:26:31,542
I’m scared for you,
for what’s happened to you.

788
01:26:31,613 --> 01:26:33,140
It’s this fucking car.

789
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:35,826
l know you’re jealous.

790
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,430
We’ll always be friends,
as long as you stick with me.

791
01:26:41,499 --> 01:26:44,694
You know what happens
to shitters who don’t.

792
01:26:44,762 --> 01:26:46,932
No. What does happen?

793
01:26:47,834 --> 01:26:50,288
Let’s not kid each other.

794
01:26:51,224 --> 01:26:52,684
Who are the shitters?

795
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:56,397
All of ‘em.

796
01:27:01,269 --> 01:27:03,690
Leigh’s on your side.

797
01:27:03,764 --> 01:27:06,633
- Oh, yeah?
- She cares a lot about you.

798
01:27:09,747 --> 01:27:11,753
She does.

799
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:13,036
Yeah.

800
01:27:14,289 --> 01:27:16,939
Don’t you like this beer?
I thought you liked beer.

801
01:27:17,008 --> 01:27:18,863
Did you hear what l just said?

802
01:27:19,919 --> 01:27:22,788
Let me tell you
a little something about love.

803
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,513
It has a voracious appetite.

804
01:27:25,582 --> 01:27:30,185
It eats everything--
friendship, family.

805
01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:32,739
It kills me, how much it eats.

806
01:27:32,811 --> 01:27:34,502
I’ll tell you something else.

807
01:27:34,571 --> 01:27:36,742
Feed it right,
and it can be a beautiful thing...

808
01:27:36,811 --> 01:27:39,461
and that’s what we have.

809
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:43,206
When someone believes in you, you can do
any fucking thing in the universe...

810
01:27:43,273 --> 01:27:45,607
and when you believe right back
in that someone...

811
01:27:45,673 --> 01:27:48,771
then watch out, world,
‘cause nobody can stop you ever!

812
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:54,142
You feel this way about Leigh?

813
01:27:56,613 --> 01:28:00,474
What? Fuck, no!
I’m talkin’ about Christine, man.

814
01:28:00,548 --> 01:28:02,849
No shitter ever came
between me and Christine.

815
01:28:04,387 --> 01:28:05,816
Watch this.

816
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:11,450
Oh, shit.

817
01:28:18,622 --> 01:28:20,345
Chicken shit!

818
01:28:22,846 --> 01:28:27,285
Man, there is nothin’ finer than being
behind the wheel of your own car...

819
01:28:28,476 --> 01:28:30,330
except maybe for pussy.

820
01:30:00,673 --> 01:30:02,528
It’s kinda spooky in here, huh?

821
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:07,318
Looks like they cleaned out
the whole place.

822
01:30:07,392 --> 01:30:09,082
Jesus.

823
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:14,842
That’s where he used to keep it.
Down there.

824
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:16,916
Yeah.

825
01:30:19,483 --> 01:30:21,010
You better get started.

826
01:30:42,197 --> 01:30:43,888
Yeah!

827
01:30:43,957 --> 01:30:45,647
What do you think?

828
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:49,801
Let’s try it.

829
01:31:36,454 --> 01:31:38,460
Christine’s gonna come
through the door.

830
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:43,453
You better get in the office
and stay out of sight.

831
01:31:43,524 --> 01:31:47,298
Once she gets inside, hit the button
and bring the door down.

832
01:31:48,323 --> 01:31:50,145
Then we’ll have her trapped.

833
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,064
What if he doesn’t come?

834
01:31:53,377 --> 01:31:55,198
Christine will.

835
01:32:21,561 --> 01:32:23,535
You better get in the office.

836
01:32:23,608 --> 01:32:25,462
Keep your head down.

837
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:30,773
When you hear me start this thing up,
that’s when you hit the button.

838
01:34:08,698 --> 01:34:11,348
Leigh, don’t move!
Stay where you are!

839
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:45,732
You shitters!

840
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:13,485
Oh, God.

841
01:37:49,018 --> 01:37:50,392
Arnie’s dead.

842
01:37:54,809 --> 01:37:57,589
I’ll forever love you

843
01:37:58,967 --> 01:38:01,203
The rest of my days

844
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:05,300
I’ll never part from you

845
01:39:50,423 --> 01:39:51,949
Are you okay?

846
01:39:53,046 --> 01:39:54,672
l think so.

847
01:40:10,833 --> 01:40:12,807
Rock, rock, rock
Oh, baby

848
01:40:20,046 --> 01:40:22,413
Rock and roll is here to stay

849
01:40:22,478 --> 01:40:24,649
It will never die

850
01:40:24,717 --> 01:40:27,051
It was meant to be that way

851
01:40:27,117 --> 01:40:29,505
Though l don’t know why

852
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:31,848
l don’t care what people say

853
01:40:31,916 --> 01:40:34,468
Rock and roll is here to stay

854
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:36,872
We don’t care what people say

855
01:40:39,337 --> 01:40:41,278
Rock and roll will always be

856
01:40:41,352 --> 01:40:44,101
l dig it to the end

857
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:46,556
It’ll go down in history

858
01:40:46,631 --> 01:40:48,802
Just you watch, my friend

859
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:51,357
Rock and roll will always be

860
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:53,797
It’ll go down in history

861
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:16,350
l wouldn’t feel so bad, if l were you.
You two are heroes, you know.

862
01:41:16,415 --> 01:41:20,569
Yeah. A real hero
could’ve saved Arnie.

863
01:41:20,636 --> 01:41:22,708
We didn’t do so hot.

864
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:25,114
Some things can’t be helped.

865
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:27,448
Some people too.

866
01:41:27,515 --> 01:41:28,889
