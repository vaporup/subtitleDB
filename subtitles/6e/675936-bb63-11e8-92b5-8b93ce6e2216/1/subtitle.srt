00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,384
Hey, transfer student.

5
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:01,291
I'm here to give you a lesson,
not to play hide-and-seek.

6
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,466
Pricks like you always think
it's cool to fail a grade.

7
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,872
Look at him.

8
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:23,244
You, son of a bitch.
This is a no-smoking area!

9
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,730
- You bastard!
- What?

10
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,098
- That hurt.
- Why'd you hit me?

11
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,238
- Wasn't it blue?
- It was pink.

12
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,740
Are you okay, Jong-soo?
Our leader's still alive.

13
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:04,289
Did you hit me? It was you, huh?
Tell me, you shitheads!

14
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,027
Who the hellz
threw something at me?

15
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,997
Hey!

16
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,031
You rotten punks.

17
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,698
If I told you to behave,
then you should listen.

18
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,430
This is why
I can't wear skirts.

19
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,873
Where are you going, asshole?

20
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,888
I heard you're the boss here.

21
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:47,494
Of course I am, asshole.
You son of a...

22
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:54,330
Then keep being the boss.
I don't care.

23
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:58,036
Hey asshole,
think you'll be the boss then?

24
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,180
Fuck, you're just a tutor.

25
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:17,287
Fuck? Oh my godness!

26
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:22,232
You little twirps.
You wanna die?

27
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:36,372
MY TUTOR FRIEND

28
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,782
You couldn't hold out
and quit again?

29
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,449
Mom, I can't do it.

30
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,886
Think making a living is that easy?
Have you forgotten already?

31
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,522
After your father lost his job,
I had to work so hard...

32
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,686
Okay, just give it to me.

33
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,162
Deliver it to Room 201, 202
in Chungwon Building.

34
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,102
I got you another tutor job.

35
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,729
If you give up on this one,
I'm giving you up.

36
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,102
Mom!

37
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,782
Remember my rich friend
I told you about?

38
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,822
She wants you to teach her son
for three months.

39
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:54,552
All you have to do is
making him study for two hours.

40
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,859
Do your best. This job will cover
your tuition for a semester.

41
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,626
She's right.

42
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:15,741
So, you must be Su-wan.
I'm Ji-hoon's mom.

43
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,583
How do you do?

44
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:25,522
It's the last room upstairs.
My poor face...

45
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,667
So you're the new teacher.

46
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:53,343
Nice to meet you.
Wow, you're handsome.

47
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,844
Kim Ji-hoon?

48
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,716
Ji-hoon is my elder brother,
I'm Sae-hoon.

49
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,324
I see.

50
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,690
Nice to meet you.

51
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,559
Same here.

52
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,829
You're very pretty.

53
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,697
Cute boy,
he's got good tastes.

54
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,536
Good luck with my brother.

55
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:28,040
This is a teenager's room?
It's big enough for a family.

56
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:34,914
Hi, I'm Choi...
I'm Choi Soo-wan

57
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,386
your new tutor.

58
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,619
Damn it, I told you
I didn't want a tutor!

59
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,916
Stop staring, damn it.

60
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:16,293
So you're 21?
So am I, born in March.

61
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,261
Got a problem with that?

62
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:26,670
How dare you?
Regardless of age, I'm your teacher.

63
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,264
I don't know
how you got that way.

64
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,937
No, I don't care. You little prick

65
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,914
better behave, got it?

66
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,176
...is what I want to say.

67
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,087
Fine then. It's fine with me.

68
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,822
Frankly, I don't like
to be called teacher.

69
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,428
So let's be friends.

70
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,496
So how shall we have class?

71
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,033
I'm busy with
classes on Tuesday, so...

72
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,629
Tuesday and Thursday,
from seven to nine.

73
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,866
And from one on Saturday.

74
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,174
Textbooks, procedures,
it's all up to you.

75
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:10,511
But it's up to me
whether I come or not.

76
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,809
Just fill in the hours and go.

77
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,015
Money?
I'll just give it to you.

78
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,806
Mom, do I have to do it?

79
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,637
So what's your point?

80
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:21,010
Alright, I'll do it!
I'll just do it, okay?

81
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,889
Smoke later.

82
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,234
I'm smoking
because I'm pissed now,

83
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:39,068
so are you asking me
to be pissed later?

84
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,662
It's hard to have class.

85
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,802
Then don't piss me off.

86
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,080
Damn it.
Then don't piss me off, too.

87
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,514
And textbook?

88
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,627
This is my English textbook.

89
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,761
Don't push it, okay?

90
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,416
What are you doing?

91
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,930
The best of its kind.

92
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,631
What is?

93
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:48,766
Don't you know?
Looks just like a flat screen TV.

94
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,337
Study!

95
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,972
Your nickname's
Country Chick, huh?

96
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,842
How'd you live
with a face like that?

97
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,514
Is this your tutor uniform?

98
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,548
You wore it last time,
so did you even wash it?

99
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,694
Kim Ji-hoon speaking.

100
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:22,671
- Gross, he's got the same ring tone.
- I don't want to go.

101
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,233
Where?

102
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,777
There aren't any hotties there.

103
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,946
I'm getting tutored right now.

104
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,778
So what are you bastards
doing not studying? Hang up.

105
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,061
Try reading it.

106
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:11,955
This is boring.
Man, this is so boring.

107
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,904
Where are you going?

108
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,143
No, I just came in.

109
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,181
I was studying,
and went to the store.

110
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,649
Tell your teacher
to have dinner with us.

111
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,620
That's why I came home early today.

112
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,525
It was on such short notice,
so I'm sorry there isn't much.

113
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,292
But eat plenty.

114
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,525
Yes, Ma'am.

115
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,168
Let's pray.

116
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,274
Like I've always said,

117
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,869
we're able to sit at this table
thanks to our heroes.

118
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:15,882
Due to the gangsters who fought
for us since Japan's occupation,

119
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,857
Sirasoni, Kim Du-han, Lee Jung-jae,
lm Hwa-su, Yoo Ji-kwang,

120
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:25,659
We're sitting here thanks to
these wonderful and great ancestor.

121
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:32,603
I'm grateful for them to bring
this tasty food to our table.

122
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:43,374
Thank you. Thank you.
The end. Let's eat.

123
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,111
Have a nice dinner, teacher.

124
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,028
Sir, what is this?
It's delicious.

125
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,930
Cow testicles.

126
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,831
Hey! Don't eat
at my house anymore.

127
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,165
You're disgusting.

128
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,409
Stop staring or I'll turn your eyes
into golf balls...

129
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,709
...is what I said to myself.

130
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,115
Please forgive
my evil thoughts.

131
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,481
When I tutor him,
I imagine ripping his guts out

132
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,082
and letting it rot.

133
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,528
I imagine him getting run over,
and his two legs break.

134
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:45,059
I imagine a brick falling on him
and smashing his brains.

135
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,932
Father, please forgive
these sinful thoughts.

136
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,305
Now that your sins
will be forgiven...

137
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,572
Wait, there's more!

138
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,206
When that bastard
smokes in front of me...

139
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,981
The way you smoked in the gym
looked spectacular.

140
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,522
When you spun around
and flicked your bud,

141
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,892
your back was so flexible,
and your legs were so stretched,

142
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,498
it was the greatest move
I've ever seen.

143
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:20,664
Actually, the gym is
no-smoking area.

144
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:28,672
By the way, how did you fall
two grades behind?

145
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,793
Kim Ji-hoon.

146
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,998
I'm Madeleine.

147
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,440
It's Yang Ho-gyung.
You're not Madeleine.

148
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:07,577
I use my Korean name
only for official reasons.

149
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,784
Do what you like.

150
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,715
Give it to me.

151
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:25,802
'Contradiction. ' Calvin Klein.
You use cologne, right?

152
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,896
I thought this would suit you.

153
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:36,643
Contradiction. Isn't it perfect?

154
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:41,084
The two of us meeting
in a place like this.

155
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,145
This is a contradiction.

156
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,121
Why don't you just marry him?

157
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:51,856
That's the idea. I finally met
the dream guy I was waiting for.

158
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,926
Dream guy?

159
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,030
Ho-gyung, one sec.

160
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:12,009
Hey, you old fart. Heard you
got a taste of living abroad, dickhead.

161
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,212
No wonder I didn't like you.

162
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:22,359
Yeah, so how'd you ever know
what goes on in the other land?

163
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,395
That queer hairstyle...

164
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,666
Oh gosh. I'm sorry.

165
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,806
You shouldn't have acted weak
from the beginning.

166
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,843
Now it's time to come out strong.

167
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,551
Whatever he says to you,
pretend not to listen.

168
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,584
And drill him with hard questions.
Throw them at him.

169
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,190
And then say,
"You don't even know this?"

170
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,498
- Okay, he's dead meat now. Victory!
- Victory!

171
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,097
Just do it!

172
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,108
Hi, Country Chick.

173
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,953
As if the moon went into the clouds.
As if, like, or as.

174
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:29,050
These are used for similes.
Number three is correct.

175
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,994
Can you give me some examples?

176
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:38,400
Ugly like Country Chick.
Ugly as Country Chick.

177
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,701
As if the Country Chick is ugly.

178
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,743
Excellent. Next question.

179
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:51,943
You feeling alright?
Why are you smiling? Wanna die?

180
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,246
- It's good to smile.
- On pretty faces it is.

181
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,484
The next question
deals with a group of poets.

182
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,621
Oh boy, this might be
too hard for you.

183
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:22,414
It's blood.

184
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,314
Hurry and wipe it!
You'll stain the desk!

185
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,648
Is the desk more important?

186
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,984
Whenever I see blood, I feel nauseas,
okay? Hurry and wipe it.

187
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:41,555
Where are you going?
We're not done yet.

188
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,844
Change your damn ring tone.

189
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,294
Hi, you've reached
Kim Ji-hoon's phone.

190
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,770
Who the hell are you
to answer Ji-hoon's phone?

191
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,168
Where the hell are you?
Why are you with Ji-hoon?

192
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,973
Give him the phone. Now!

193
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,446
What? You bitch.

194
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,783
Do you want your head
shoved down the toilet?

195
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,914
Come the hell out.

196
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,891
So I can put your face
in a mixer and drink it!

197
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:48,699
Ji-hoon, honey.
Are you still in the shower?

198
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,199
Hey!

199
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:58,704
Hurry and come out.
Since you're gone... Go to hell!

200
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,113
Stop the circus act.

201
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,278
Forgot your clothes?

202
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,981
Then turn around,
so I can get dressed.

203
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,519
What are you doing?

204
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,583
We have an hour left of class.

205
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,924
Then go in an hour,
and say I'm sleeping.

206
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,328
No, I can't do that.

207
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,236
Just shut up and go later,
I'll give you the money.

208
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,567
Hey.

209
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,545
Do you want me so much?

210
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,911
I can't lie.

211
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,386
Hold it in, okay?
How could you want your student?

212
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,854
You're scaring me.

213
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,652
That's not what I meant.

214
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:53,257
Why do you want to
get tutored anyway?

215
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,526
If it's to make a fool of me,
then stop getting tutored.

216
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,465
I'm not doing this for myself,

217
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,438
my old dad wants me to.

218
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,874
My old dad is really scary.

219
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,308
He'll cancel my credit cards
if I don't do this.

220
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,778
So don't get so upset.
It's bad for your health.

221
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,258
Let's live easily. See you later.

222
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,722
Hey! Hey!

223
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,829
Who are you?

224
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,389
Were you that bitch
on the phone?

225
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,265
Why are you coming out
of Ji-hoon's place?

226
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,837
I'm his tutor, so what?

227
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,307
Tutor? You're in college?

228
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:15,710
Then how come
you look so tacky? Watch it!

229
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,776
You're in high school, huh?
I'm older than you, so be nice!

230
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,955
Wanna play it rough,
tacky girl?

231
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,117
Hey!

232
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,693
The way you look is a relief.

233
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,563
I know it'll never happen,

234
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,765
but if you flirt with Ji-hoon
for even a second, you're dead.

235
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,366
Just tutor him well. Got it?

236
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:49,072
You rotten tramps.
Don't you have any older sisters?

237
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:28,749
Do it with the light on, idiot.
You scared me.

238
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,912
Hurry inside.

239
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:46,170
Hey, Kim Ji-hoon! What's up?

240
00:26:53,878 --> 00:27:00,909
You're my handsome man
I fell in love at first sight

241
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:08,324
If it's okay,
I want to wake up by your side

242
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,951
Feel it!

243
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,020
Don't worry at all

244
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:17,262
I already know
what you're thinking

245
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:22,932
I don't have any
past love or memories

246
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:30,938
I love only you
Why don't you trust me?

247
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:37,717
You're the only one
in my life till I die

248
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:45,355
No, even if I die,
my love is only for you

249
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:52,962
So please open your heart,
trust me and love me

250
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,312
I reserved...

251
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:09,115
You idiot. You hit the cancel button,
not to reserve button!

252
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,620
Asshole!

253
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,642
What did you do now?

254
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,582
Wanna die?

255
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,315
It wasn't me!

256
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,254
Freeze, it's the police!

257
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,168
Tell them there's one more.

258
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,762
Say they missed a pretty boy
looking bastard, okay?

259
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,678
- Go!
- Get the hell going!

260
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:23,216
They said Kim Ji-hoon
isn't a minor.

261
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,262
Shit, that's right!

262
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,266
Get it right, you asshole!
You sons of bitches!

263
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,602
Fuck!

264
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,839
Why haven't you left yet?

265
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,608
You're not asking
to stay over, right?

266
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,873
You're not my type.

267
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,715
Take a taxi and go.

268
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,800
What's wrong with you?
Gone crazy?

269
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,571
I've met a lot of misfits before,

270
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,078
but you're the worst.

271
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,978
Why do you go to school?
To show off your money?

272
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,555
Even though you pay me to tutor,
you shouldn't do this.

273
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,853
I should get some respect at least.

274
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:08,064
You're not even a person,
so what's the use in learning?

275
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,031
Watch your mouth.

276
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:16,367
Why? You wanna hit me?
Fine! Hit me!

277
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,137
You should be ashamed
of being two grades behind.

278
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:24,707
Then stay in high school until
you're 30 or 40, you bastard!

279
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,994
As long as I got paid,
I thought it would be okay,

280
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,552
but I can't sell out
my pride anymore.

281
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,096
Bye.

282
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:57,042
Guys who are all talk
aren't really tough. He's a fake.

283
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,108
You need to be tougher
on guys like him.

284
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:05,246
But seeing the way he acts
and looks at me,

285
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,758
could he really hurt me?

286
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:12,091
It's all an act. Sis, you don't know
high school kids these days.

287
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:16,361
A third of our class pierced their ears.
Some even pierced their bellies.

288
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:23,033
Why isn't mom answering the phone?

289
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,950
Shit! What a shame...

290
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,119
Aren't you coming in?

291
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,933
Sit straight.

292
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,202
Don't be late anymore.

293
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,409
Call me two hours earlier
if you're late.

294
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,878
So I won't waste my time.

295
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,383
I thought you didn't
want to come anymore.

296
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:13,789
If you disagree with me, then fire me.
And we'll call it quits.

297
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:18,659
I've had a truckload
full of tutors before you.

298
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,593
But I was never the one
to say quit first.

299
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,134
They're the ones
who left first.

300
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,931
I thought you'd quit
in less than a month.

301
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,909
But this is fun.

302
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:37,914
I've never quit something
I started.

303
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,349
We'll see who is fun.

304
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,284
We were going to
study phrases, right?

305
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:50,253
Hey, do we really
have to study?

306
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:56,233
Then what else
is there to do here? Date?

307
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,261
Let's study.

308
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,335
Chinese phrases are usually
on tests, so listen carefully.

309
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,537
You know
'Four Enemies One Soul, ' right?

310
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,406
Yeah, fighting thugs
on all four sides.

311
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,717
'Small Needle Big Molehill.'

312
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,980
Exaggerating your ass off.

313
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,022
'Dark Play Good Shot.'

314
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,956
Good shot?
I know good shots.

315
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:27,396
In pool, you have several
good shots to win the game.

316
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:33,835
Like for example,
you have the snap shot.

317
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,930
'True Intimacy Friendly Foe.'

318
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,906
Listen carefully. You may think you
have a lot of friends now,

319
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:49,347
but if you're not true to them,
then it won't last.

320
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:55,651
If you run out of money,
then they'll leave you in a flash.

321
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,318
Watch your mouth, bitch.

322
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,886
What? What did you just say?

323
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,671
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:17,472
No smoking during lessons.
Do it on break time.

325
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,251
No, just quit instead.

326
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,622
Damn it.

327
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,224
Cheers!

328
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,901
What did I tell you?
You have to come out strong.

329
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,102
That was my advice.

330
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:50,978
I'm the one who said
guys are hypocrites.

331
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,578
So I'm the one
who gave her courage.

332
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:03,355
Hey, hey. I'm the one who taught her
the special methods of tutoring.

333
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:09,991
What's wrong with you two?
It's my life that I'm risking.

334
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:15,334
So this occasion is for me. To me!

335
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,535
Remember, come out
strong one more time,

336
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,205
then you'll totally control him.

337
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:29,743
Don't worry.
He's in the palm of my hands.

338
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,091
English idioms can only be memorized.

339
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:38,788
Since your brain is blank,
it'll be to your benefit.

340
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,626
Really funny.

341
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,027
You should memorize
these idioms.

342
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,831
Be careful, watch out, take care...

343
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,735
That's what you should do.

344
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,203
Put up with, bear, and stand
are other examples.

345
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,576
They always come out on tests,
so memorize them.

346
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,017
Here's an easy way
to memorize them.

347
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,679
Imagine a bear standing.

348
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:07,087
The bear stands, so...

349
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:14,428
That's right. When a bear stands,
so will his dick.

350
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,158
Get your head
out of the gutter.

351
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,528
You better not
hit my head again.

352
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,073
I told you to turn off your phone!

353
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,401
It's yours.

354
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,352
Hello?

355
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:47,664
Si-kyung, is that you?
Where are you? Really?

356
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:54,101
When? I missed you so much.

357
00:37:54,672 --> 00:38:00,838
You sent a postcard to our club,
but you didn't mention me at all.

358
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:17,386
When? Really?
Okay. Bye, bye.

359
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,697
What?

360
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,827
There's actually some guy
who calls you?

361
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:29,862
He's on a different level
compared to your airhead girls.

362
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,339
I bet he's ugly.

363
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:36,642
He's more handsome than
any actors on the planet.

364
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,477
I haven't seen him,
so don't lie.

365
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,110
He's not a bonehead like you
who only likes pretty girls.

366
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,954
So you accept the fact you're ugly?
It's a good thing.

367
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,855
It's mine.

368
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,702
Kim Ji-hoon speaking.

369
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,642
I can't hear you.
Speak slowly and clearly.

370
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:09,943
Really?

371
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,842
You can't!
I can't let you go today!

372
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,819
If you keep this up,
I'll tell your dad!

373
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,379
Get out of my way! It's urgent!

374
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,390
I won't move.

375
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,222
I'm not kidding, damn it!

376
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,625
You can't go!

377
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,821
You're driving me crazy.

378
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,168
Hey! You rotten bastard!

379
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,019
Engine stop!

380
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,329
What situation is this?

381
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,393
We're on our way out
to buy a textbook.

382
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,399
Your teacher can buy it herself.

383
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,604
We were going to pick it together.

384
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,702
And she didn't know
the bus to the bookstore.

385
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,313
You little...

386
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,151
Yes, we need
an English textbook.

387
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:28,286
One that fits Ji-hoon's
level just right.

388
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,394
Then go buy a book,

389
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:36,957
and take a picture with it
to show me proof.

390
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,913
Ji-hoon! Ji-hoon!

391
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,789
Hey! What are you doing here?

392
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,853
So they're up there?

393
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,523
Yeah.

394
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,890
You two wait here.

395
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,904
Hey, so why did you come?

396
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,005
Think I wanted to come here?

397
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,443
So you couldn't resist
and sided with him?

398
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,478
You worthless traitors.

399
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:29,247
Hey assholes,
Ji-hoon's nothing without money.

400
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:35,987
Today, I'm going to make you all
regret siding with Ji-hoon.

401
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:42,997
Shit, do you like
getting your ass whooped?

402
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,376
What? So he's in a fight right now?

403
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,110
You idiot, think you
came here for a date then?

404
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,383
I thought you liked him,
so how could you be so calm?

405
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,724
Stop acting
like you're his mom.

406
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:16,664
If you're that worried,
then go up yourself, damn it.

407
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,993
Stop smiling, you asshole!

408
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,136
Hurry and get off.

409
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,115
Get over here. Come closer.

410
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:43,517
The textbook.
Hurry and stand straight.

411
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:51,824
Lean forward. Lean.
Smile.

412
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:56,829
Smile. Raise the book.
Smile!

413
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:58,595
Isn't he Kim Ji-hoon?

414
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,160
It is him!

415
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,398
Know him?

416
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,306
So this guy is your student?

417
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,476
So my temperamental sister
is still alive?

418
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,708
Hurry and tell me
what you know about him.

419
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,543
I heard this transfer student

420
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:19,055
trampled all over Lee Jong-soo,
the boss of Surim High.

421
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:23,184
He was a third year senior.
I heard he was so fast,

422
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,285
you couldn't see him move.

423
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,992
But why's he getting tutored?

424
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,035
Were there any rumors
that he didn't hit girls?

425
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,091
None.

426
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:35,966
I thought he was a fake.

427
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,273
But I didn't know it was him.
Can I have this picture?

428
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,505
I wanna show it off.

429
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,227
Officer!

430
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,699
Where are you going?
Please don't leave.

431
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,945
You can't leave, okay?

432
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,777
Mommy!

433
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,679
You scared me.

434
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,017
Going somewhere, Ma'am?

435
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:34,087
I have an alumni meeting.
Didn't your mom tell you?

436
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:40,899
Oh, right.
So no one's home right now?

437
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,701
Ji-hoon is, why?

438
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,875
Stop that! My Ji-hoon is not
that kind of boy.

439
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,807
But still.

440
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:57,945
Have a nice class.
Go driver.

441
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:21,238
What was I going
to teach you this time?

442
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:32,045
What's wrong with you today?
You were going to teach verbs.

443
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,625
'Tutor Freezes to Death
After Teaching Verbs'

444
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:43,893
Verbs might be
a bit hard for today.

445
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,898
What else?

446
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,768
What's wrong with you?
Feeling sick?

447
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,943
How about prepositions?

448
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,572
Prepositions?

449
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,650
I like sex positions better.

450
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:20,268
What are you doing?
Let's study instead.

451
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,565
Bear me my child.

452
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:33,080
No! No!
No, we're still too young.

453
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,987
Are you fantasizing?

454
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:50,261
What's with you? I already have
too many girls who want me.

455
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,830
Take this off, too.

456
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,236
But I'll have to go barefoot.

457
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,901
I know that, you idiot.
Hurry and take it off.

458
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,869
See if he has anything else.

459
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:03,935
Satisfied now?

460
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:11,249
Hey, take this, too.

461
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,453
I'll tell my brother you said hi.

462
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:22,988
Of course you will, boy.
Wait. Put these on at least.

463
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,695
If you get to know me,
I'm a good guy.

464
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,669
Be careful going home.

465
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,701
Sometimes I vomit blood.

466
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:44,520
I must have tuberculosis.

467
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,426
Do you know that
it's contagious?

468
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,396
I look too healthy to be sick.

469
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:06,367
So all this came from a
middle school kid's bag?

470
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,142
Yes, isn't it great?

471
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,544
We should make him
into a regular here.

472
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,675
If you beat up Ji-hoon,
we'll give you everything.

473
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,651
Only if he comes.

474
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,467
Why do you scums always
hang out at a pool hall?

475
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,163
Got nowhere else to go?

476
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,835
Think we like coming here
because we wanna?

477
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,641
Then tell me where else
we should hang out, asshole!

478
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,046
Stop babbling, idiot.

479
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,850
Are you Kim Ji-hoon?

480
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:53,548
Maybe.

481
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,689
Be nice to him, asshole!

482
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,923
He's a Makjubshi Gang boss
and they control this turf.

483
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,097
You look like a
real pain-in-the-neck.

484
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,769
Hey, have you heard
of our gang?

485
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:14,436
I don't care what gang it is,
but your zipper's open.

486
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,572
Bastard.
Gonna hit me when I look down?

487
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:22,516
Crazy bastard.
Then leave it open and fight.

488
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:28,182
Son of a bitch.

489
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,281
It's blood.
Big trouble.

490
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,079
If he sees blood, he goes nuts.

491
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,043
You stood me up again,
you rotten bastard.

492
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:09,248
Why aren't you giving me
the chance to talk to you?

493
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:13,885
Anyway, lessons are over.

494
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,798
I'm too scared of you,
so I can't come anymore.

495
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:22,305
I'd rather my mom kill me.
Good-bye.

496
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:43,282
Stop pretending,
and help me up.

497
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:50,362
What happened to you?

498
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:09,443
It's blood!

499
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,282
Don't scream, okay?

500
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,692
Be quiet or die.

501
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,422
Wanna die?

502
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,461
Will you be quiet?

503
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:44,110
Come on, damn it. Stop looking and
bring the bandage. It's in that drawer.

504
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,848
Okay.

505
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,482
What shampoo do you use?

506
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,917
But I use soap.

507
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,727
Don't be so rough, damn it.

508
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,804
Name.

509
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,311
Kim Ji-hoon.

510
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,347
Age.

511
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:52,847
Twenty-one.

512
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,315
Employment.

513
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,379
Student.

514
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,681
What college?

515
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,749
I'm in high school.

516
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,055
Are you proud of that, asshole?

517
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:16,371
Here's your plane ticket,
so go back.

518
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,770
I won't.

519
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,036
Go before I get angrier.

520
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,069
I blocked your expulsion,
but there's no use in staying. So go!

521
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,213
No, you go.

522
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:29,945
I'm too old to study abroad,
idiot!

523
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,029
I told you to
punch faster, boy.

524
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,430
Go.

525
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,661
I won't go.

526
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,168
Give me all your credit cards.

527
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:58,710
Father! Please, not that...

528
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,090
Did you call, sir?

529
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,115
Clean out his pockets.

530
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:12,025
Dad, you're being too cruel.

531
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,354
Don't come closer.
You'll die if you do!

532
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,094
Dad! Dad!

533
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,641
'Su-wan's Fried Chicken'

534
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,080
Open the door and come out!

535
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,218
Okay, already.

536
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:47,319
So what brings you
to a chicken store, Madam?

537
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,297
Don't be so cold.

538
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:54,701
You being the only friend
I can turn to makes me mad.

539
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,137
So you came to
pick a fight again?

540
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:04,074
Ji-hoon was never like that.

541
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,548
Even though he fought sometimes,
he was a nice boy.

542
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:11,109
And he never started the fights.

543
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:15,886
I think it was wrong
to send him to America.

544
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,257
It was my idea, you see.

545
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,755
It's been a week
since he ran away.

546
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,560
What if something bad
happens to him, Kyung-ja?

547
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,639
Why is he so late?

548
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,780
Don't you have tutoring
lessons today?

549
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,584
That's too bad.
Si-kyung isn't your man anymore.

550
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,497
Here he comes!

551
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,470
It's a gift from Ji-hoon.

552
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,073
Wow, can I try it on?

553
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,880
Think it'll look good on you?

554
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:53,047
Shall I buy you one, too?

555
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:57,559
Get a life.
Think you can afford this?

556
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,595
Wow, Ji-hoon,
what a great watch.

557
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:04,622
It's a Bvlgari. It's my present to him.

558
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,601
It must be really expensive.

559
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,142
'Are you some kid to run away?'

560
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,685
'Think you're cool?'

561
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,381
'Hungry, huh? I'm eating noodles'

562
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,650
'I envy you to
run away at that age'

563
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,090
'No, I wanna come, too'

564
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,924
'I like getting paid still,
so don't come back'

565
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,930
'Wanna come home, huh?'

566
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,125
'Why won't you study abroad?'

567
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,794
'Can I go for you instead?'

568
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:22,567
- Kim Ji-hoon speak...
- You finally answered!

569
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,774
Think this phone is for you?

570
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,010
Why'd you fill it
with messages?

571
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:32,213
Let's meet. Where are you?

572
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,787
Why?

573
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:38,486
You hate going abroad that much?
Others would die to go.

574
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:43,395
Forget it.
I'll go crazy talking to you.

575
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:47,300
Hey,
let's meet at your place today.

576
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,600
Just worry about your own life.

577
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,903
Come back,
so I can give you a present.

578
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,205
I'm hanging up.

579
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,246
Anyway, why do you
need to go to school?

580
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:01,247
Since you're rich,
you won't have to worry later.

581
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:06,516
My old man wants me
to graduate high school. Satisfied?

582
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:11,288
You like your dad, don't you?

583
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,696
I knew you had a nice side in you.

584
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,507
What the hell?
Why did you come here?

585
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,042
Think this is your home?

586
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,272
You told me I had to
fill in the hours to get paid.

587
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,481
You greedy snob.
You make me sick.

588
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:40,648
Then what about you? You came
for your present already?

589
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:47,091
Present, my ass. What is it?
Give it to me.

590
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,598
Here it is. I'm your gift.

591
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,597
Have you gone nuts?
I don't want it.

592
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,663
Listen carefully.

593
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:04,338
I'm your guardian angel who'll
help you go, I mean, stay home.

594
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:09,040
What for? You want something
from me, huh?

595
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:13,484
Dummy.
You should be grateful.

596
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:17,686
Fine. Just don't call me
Country Chick anymore.

597
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,990
Do I look like a Country Chick?

598
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,194
No, her sister.

599
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:33,732
Su-wan, Ji-hoon's
father is here. Ji-hoon!

600
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:43,280
You can't go!

601
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,523
Go study abroad.

602
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,886
No.

603
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,563
Want a beating?

604
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,425
Kim Bong-man!

605
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,799
What is it?

606
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,773
Sir, just give Ji-hoon
to me instead.

607
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:10,836
Wait a minute. Ji-hoon still hasn't
fulfilled his military service.

608
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,746
And he has no job,
but you want to marry him?

609
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:18,810
Pardon?
No, that's not what I meant.

610
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,049
I meant as Ji-hoon's teacher.

611
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,522
Sit first.

612
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:27,029
Sit and let's listen to Su-wan,
I mean, his teacher.

613
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,620
Please sit.

614
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:39,230
Yes, if he studies abroad,
it'll open up new doors.

615
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:43,176
And maybe he'll change
into a new person.

616
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:48,946
But it could turn into a failure
if he doesn't want to go.

617
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:58,491
And Ji-hoon could become a
drug addict and join the mafia.

618
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,491
So what are you saying?

619
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:06,058
So if you could just trust him...

620
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:10,162
You're telling me to trust him?

621
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:12,933
Although I know
it'll be hard to do...

622
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,939
To be more exact,

623
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,983
since this is about
Ji-hoon's life,

624
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:26,010
I think it'll be good to
respect his decision, sir.

625
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,953
If he makes the wrong decision,
