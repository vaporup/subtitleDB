1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,355
If he makes the wrong decision,

2
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:07,156
then we have no choice
but to decide for him.

3
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:22,868
I'll raise my average above 50
on the next mid-term.

4
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:25,480
What did you say?

5
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:26,914
Ji-hoon!

6
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,812
I'll get above a 50, okay?

7
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:32,821
Wait a minute, sir!

8
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:35,414
From an expert's perspective,
this is an abnormal act of...

9
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,821
Shut the fuck up!

10
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,155
It's none of your business!

11
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:40,889
Do you know me?
I know what I'm doing.

12
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,361
Have you really gone crazy?

13
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:46,629
Speak Korean
so I can understand.

14
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,239
I'll get above a 50, okay?

15
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,073
If I don't, do as you like.

16
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:56,837
Fuck! Fuck!

17
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,881
Just tell him
you'll go abroad.

18
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,110
Make some sense. Pack!

19
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,310
And I'll reserve your ticket.

20
00:01:02,386 --> 00:01:05,048
Do you think raising your grades
is as easy as fighting?

21
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:06,521
If you don't wanna help,
then leave!

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,990
Yeah, you won't need my help
since you speak English well!

23
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,492
Why do you need tutoring?

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,087
I can speak English,
but I can't read it!

25
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,600
It's different on tests!

26
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,498
This is insane.

27
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,037
Then why did you
make that promise?

28
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,905
How do you expect to raise
your average from 8 to 50?

29
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:28,103
God can't even help you.

30
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:32,545
Feel bad? I'm sorry,
but I have to say it.

31
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:35,107
It's better than
a promise you can't keep.

32
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:39,884
There's no use in having
an I-can-do-it attitude.

33
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:43,392
Stop speaking nonsense,
and tell me what to study.

34
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:09,016
Peasants' Uprising of 1895.

35
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:19,723
Are you feeling okay? Did you hurt
your head when you fought Jong-soo?

36
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:24,165
He's a cruel bastard
for hitting your head.

37
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:27,567
Do you know about
the Peasants' Uprising?

38
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:28,934
What?

39
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,371
It was caused by a death
in the Ulmi Year.

40
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,274
Do you know what death it was?

41
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:35,606
What?

42
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:41,077
Queen Myungsung was killed
by the yakuzas.

43
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:45,778
Know who Queen Myungsung is?

44
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,460
Come on.

45
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:55,430
Think I'm that dumb?
It's Actress Lee Mi-yeon.

46
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,764
You idiot.

47
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:11,803
It wasn't her in that TV series?

48
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,816
It was Kang Soo-yeon, idiot.

49
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:19,822
Fuck, why does he have
to study all of a sudden?

50
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:36,500
I should've just picked randomly.

51
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:42,201
That's what I'm saying.
Here's some solid advice.

52
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,378
Do as your father says.

53
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:46,779
Wanna die?

54
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:51,614
Go become a mafia gangster,
and form a global gang.

55
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:54,885
Yeah, becoming a national hero
will be easier.

56
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,820
You call yourself a tutor?

57
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:59,691
Then you think
a tutor can do magic?

58
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:03,264
What will you do
if I get above a 50, huh?

59
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,229
From here to there are the
questions I taught you before.

60
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:11,706
So you could've
gotten a 60 score.

61
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:15,973
But the result? Only 18.

62
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,344
Anyway, so what'll you do
if I get above a 50?

63
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,846
You get above a 50?

64
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:26,888
Then I'll dance on stage
at our school festival.

65
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:38,163
That would be fun.
You made a promise, okay?

66
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,481
Sorry to call all of you here.

67
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:55,918
I have a problem,
so you'll have to help me.

68
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:58,079
I'll assign you a subject,

69
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,452
So make 100 questions each.

70
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:03,151
At least half of them
must be on the test.

71
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,202
It's mine.

72
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,512
Ji-hoon, you can smoke
two cartons during class.

73
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,242
Ji-hoon, please.
Let's talk about it.

74
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,979
Let's be reasonable!

75
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:08,850
You can't do this to me!
I helped you with the test!

76
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:14,994
The next entry is
a Junior majoring in English.

77
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:18,034
Let's welcome Choi Su-wan!

78
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:48,089
Hi, I'm Choi Su-wan,
a Junior majoring in English.

79
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:50,166
I hope you enjoy it.

80
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:02,928
Bye.

81
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:09,596
Why are you looking
at me like that?

82
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:12,334
Weren't you embarrassed
for a girl?

83
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:14,501
Why didn't you
just dance naked?

84
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:16,408
It looked like a strip show.

85
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:20,606
Who's the one
who told me to dance?

86
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,541
Have plans this sunday?

87
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:25,376
None of your business.

88
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:29,122
Just tell me. Although I know
you won't have any.

89
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:33,021
Our club is visiting
an orphanage. Why?

90
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,488
Is that bastard going?

91
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:41,661
Who? My honey, Si-kyung?

92
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:44,263
Honey, my ass.

93
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,774
Why else would I be going
if he wasn't?

94
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:50,101
Hey, is that a volunteer's attitude?

95
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:53,012
Think what you like. Bye.

96
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:36,021
How do you do?

97
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:11,223
I've been thinking a lot.

98
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:18,425
It's been on my mind constantly.
So I've had many sleepless nights.

99
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:21,698
Just say you want
to screw her, asshole

100
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:24,439
Si-kyung.

101
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:28,938
Su-wan, it's not a choice,
it's fate.

102
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:31,942
I'm fine with throwing
my everything away.

103
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:35,473
My family, friends, and future.

104
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,349
My mind and body
isn't mine anyway, Su-wan.

105
00:11:54,404 --> 00:12:00,570
Si-kyung.
Si-kyung, are you okay?

106
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,511
Hey, Kim Ji-hoon!
What are you doing there?

107
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:50,218
What'll you do now?
They're not your friends anymore.

108
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,786
Look at my arm.

109
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:57,383
I can't bathe and wipe my ass.
And look how dirty my hair is, asshole.

110
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:00,925
Know how precious
the right arm is?

111
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:04,364
Shit, only if your big head
hadn't dodged him.

112
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:10,063
Fine, I saw you in action
at the pool hall,

113
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:14,171
so I'll make you Number 2,
okay?

114
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,670
Number 2?

115
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,115
Shit. Ji-hoon, you bastard.

116
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:58,317
What's taking you so long?

117
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,180
Are you drunken?

118
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:07,588
You're pathetic for a tutor.
You don't wanna get paid, huh?

119
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:10,523
What?

120
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:31,109
Hi.

121
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,288
How long have
you been drinking?

122
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,752
Sorry.

123
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:43,231
Let's have today's class here.

124
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:50,000
Today's subject
is broken hearts.

125
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:51,630
Did you get dumped?

126
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:54,834
Nope.

127
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:00,411
Yeah.

128
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,180
Nope.

129
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,524
Yeah.

130
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:14,359
Wanna die? Stop screwing around.

131
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,730
Everyone, I've been dumped!

132
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:25,262
I've been dumped!
Everyone, I've been dumped!

133
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:28,504
Everybody,
I've been dumped!

134
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:32,103
I've been dumped...

135
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:36,546
What the hell
was so good about him?

136
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,746
At first,

137
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:46,786
I liked his soft smile.

138
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:51,930
And then...

139
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:57,467
I liked his voice.

140
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:07,773
And since I liked liking him,
I liked him even more.

141
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,844
And then I loved him.

142
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:19,384
Since I loved him,
my heart became broken.

143
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,932
But I could only let him go.

144
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:32,940
There's nothing I can do.

145
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:39,972
I'm stupid, heart-broken,
hopeless, and down.

146
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:45,316
Hurry and get up!
You're too drunken.

147
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:49,415
Ji-hoon, what are
you two doing?

148
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:54,425
Now you're trying
to seduce him with tears?

149
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:57,330
Ji-hoon, don't trust her.

150
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,892
Since you're studying with her,
the guys are leaving you.

151
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,703
Hey, I'm really tired already,
so you better go, okay?

152
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:06,605
Ji-hoon!

153
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:12,238
It's you. The City Chick.

154
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:16,410
Nice to see you.
Wanna drink with me?

155
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:18,146
Have you gone nuts?

156
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,984
You're always mean.

157
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,547
Stop acting so drunk,
damn it.

158
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:29,592
Why'd you hit my pretty face?

159
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,363
Come here and
I'll give you a kiss. It's so soft.

160
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:39,304
You crazy bitch!

161
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,669
Ji-hoon!

162
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:52,778
Let go.

163
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:55,348
You're really overdoing it today.

164
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,358
What's gotten into you?

165
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:05,930
This is the place.

166
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:09,164
Why? Wanna throw up?

167
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,009
On a rainy night...

168
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:20,177
By a red telephone booth...

169
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:26,584
Under the streetlight...

170
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,620
I wanted my first kiss
at a place like this.

171
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:39,196
You're really overdoing it.

172
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:50,506
I even practiced a pose.

173
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,017
Like this.

174
00:20:48,637 --> 00:21:00,276
Why? Why does God
have to be my rival?

175
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:04,883
Hey!

176
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,538
Who are you to make her cry?

177
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:28,202
Su-wan may be a Country Chick...
Man, I'm pissed.

178
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:32,805
She's not worth
getting hurt from you!

179
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,907
I think there's
been some mistake.

180
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:41,389
Mistake, my ass.
I don't know who she is,

181
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:45,359
but if I see that
she's worse than Su-wan,

182
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:50,990
you and her are dead.
Got it? So who is she?

183
00:21:54,036 --> 00:22:00,635
Fine, the sweetheart
who's in your heart now.

184
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:05,271
This is making me sick.
Who is she? I said who?

185
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,972
You're making a mistake.

186
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,277
It's not a woman.

187
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:13,253
I'll be a father soon.

188
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:16,120
- What?
- A father.

189
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,928
You rotten son of a bitch.

190
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:22,192
You already have a kid?

191
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:27,296
Rotten bastard.

192
00:22:30,873 --> 00:22:33,467
Thanks for the milk, asshole.

193
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,637
You bastard.

194
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:14,531
Why'd you hit him? Why?

195
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:20,847
Do you have to keep this up?

196
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:24,711
Okay, hit me. Hit me.

197
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:43,193
Are you really a girl?

198
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:47,106
Why does your punch sting?

199
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,343
Feel better now?
Was he your first love?

200
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,146
Has this happened to you?

201
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,484
Think I'm the type
to get dumped like you?

202
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:08,353
Have you ever
truly loved someone?

203
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:18,269
Probably not
with a temper like that.

204
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:30,550
Wanna fly into the sky?

205
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,614
I'm serious.

206
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,408
Like it?

207
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:05,118
I like it! Very much!

208
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:08,053
Tomorrow is our last lesson.

209
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:09,852
That's right.

210
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,167
Hey, Su-wan.

211
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:21,395
What?

212
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:26,737
I've been thinking.
You're a pretty cool chick.

213
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:29,172
Now you know?

214
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:33,180
This is the first time
I've told somebody this,

215
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:36,546
but I think I like you.

216
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:41,913
Hello?

217
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:45,084
Su-wan. Su-wan.

218
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:49,963
Can't you hear me?

219
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,599
Su-wan, can you hear me?

220
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,339
What? What? I can't hear you.

221
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,540
Su-wan, pull the left string!

222
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:13,381
Don't panic.

223
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:44,745
Su-wan, are you okay?

224
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:46,752
It hurts.

225
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:55,823
You have to study English consistently.
There's no other way.

226
00:27:56,531 --> 00:28:01,195
Study the idioms and synonyms
I wrote down before your test.

227
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:06,698
You've done a good job.

228
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,538
Well, I...

229
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:16,348
I hope I was a
good teacher to you.

230
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:21,048
There's no need to emphasize
that you were a teacher.

231
00:28:21,123 --> 00:28:22,590
I understand.

232
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:46,379
Wait a sec.

233
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:35,696
Oh boy, my legs hurt.

234
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:06,953
Su-wan!

235
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:09,963
Oh my gosh, it's my friend.

236
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,429
What are you doing here?

237
00:30:14,503 --> 00:30:17,563
You bad girl, how'd you
catch me on a date?

238
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:22,310
This is my friend, Su-wan.

239
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,834
- Hello.
- Hello.

240
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:27,107
The guy I mentioned.
The med student.

241
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,176
Hello.

242
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:33,244
Yes, hello.

243
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:36,348
Who have you been
hiding from me?

244
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:40,053
No, he's the one
I've been tutoring.

245
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:43,597
The bad student?

246
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:47,064
So you two are dating now?

247
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:50,036
Think I'm crazy to
date a high school...

248
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:57,140
It looks fishy to me.

249
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,180
This doesn't seem like
a place to study.

250
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,016
It's our farewell party.
Wanna join us?

251
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:11,616
No way.
We're getting very intimate.

252
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,160
Have fun with your teacher.

253
00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:17,964
I'll call you later.

254
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:25,163
Why? Envious?

255
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:29,208
Of course. He's handsome,
and has a good major.

256
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:33,737
Snobs. And being rich
would also be nice, Right?

257
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:36,407
All you care about is status.

258
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:38,315
That was mean.

259
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,478
Is that your standard
for guys, too?

260
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:43,149
Guys like that wouldn't be bad.

261
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,495
But it's crazy to date
someone in high school?

262
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:51,925
That's now what I meant.

263
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,437
I thought you were different.
But you're all the same.

264
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:59,070
You all think superficially.

265
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:05,144
What makes you so different from
Ho-gyung who's materialistic?

266
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:13,852
What is it?

267
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:15,421
This is yours.

268
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,889
Why should I accept this?

269
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:24,596
Then don't. I bought it for you,
so it's not even mine.

270
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:02,859
What is it?

271
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:14,279
Does Kim Ji-hoon's tutor
live here by any chance?

272
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:18,251
Su-wan? She went on a delivery.

273
00:33:29,464 --> 00:33:31,125
Stop! Wait!

274
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:34,593
What do you want?

275
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:39,632
Are you Kim Ji-hoon's tutor
by any chance?

276
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,175
Not anymore.

277
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:43,107
Grab her!

278
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:45,401
Come with us for a moment.

279
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,572
What are you doing?

280
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:51,574
Hello?

281
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:56,487
Say something! Speak!

282
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:58,919
It hung up.

283
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,984
Damn it!

284
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,224
What bastard is prank calling?

285
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:08,030
Hold on for a sec, idiot!

286
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:13,196
What?

287
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:15,643
Choi Su-wan?

288
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,541
I have to make a delivery,
so stop this.

289
00:34:19,748 --> 00:34:22,376
Hello? Hello?

290
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:28,920
Who? Lee Jong-soo? Hey!

291
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:31,856
My ear's gonna fall off,
you bastard!

292
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:34,827
Of course you have to come.
Here?

293
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:39,289
Catch her, you bastards!

294
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:48,436
Hello?

295
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,536
You're with Jong-soo, huh?
Where are you?

296
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:54,844
Damn it,
I'm running right now!

297
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:08,561
So you ordered the chicken?

298
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,461
I doubted it at first.

299
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:15,401
But I'd never think he'd like
a Country Chick like you.

300
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:20,000
Your job was to tutor him,
not seduce him.

301
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:31,346
Here's the chicken,
so pay me 216,000 won.

302
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:43,857
I wanna throw you like
that chicken and crush you.

303
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:52,536
Why'd you throw it?
Who are you to do that?

304
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:56,099
My dad raised them himself,
and my mom cooked it.

305
00:35:56,177 --> 00:35:58,611
And you throw it away?

306
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,988
Stop it! Stop it!
I said stop it!

307
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:12,488
What do you want?

308
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,461
She's mine,
so you stay out of it!

309
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:17,121
No she's not, she's mine.

310
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,565
You bastards.

311
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:26,303
It's not your day to tutor,
so be quiet.

312
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:31,209
You're a hostage today.
Ji-hoon's bait.

313
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:34,337
Pay for the chicken.

314
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,250
Pay for the chicken!

315
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,691
Hello?

316
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:47,525
We're waiting too long
because of you, asshole.

317
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:49,790
Are you testing my patience?

318
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,158
- Shut up your mouth!
- Let me go, you bastard!

319
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:10,612
Are you okay?

320
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:14,218
Do I look okay to you?

321
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:17,222
Let's go.

322
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:22,119
Ji-hoon!

323
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,030
He's here. I said he's right here.

324
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:33,737
You can't leave now.

325
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:38,906
Jong-soo, you've gone insane.

326
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,107
Ji-hoon, I can't
take it anymore.

327
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:43,946
I wanna make sure today.
Is it that bitch or me?

328
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:45,212
Move, bitch.

329
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,756
If you listen to me,
I'll let her go, but if not...

330
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:50,246
No, you move!

331
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,392
Ji-hoon!

332
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,789
That's the bastard!

333
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,061
Who the hell are you?

334
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:02,295
They're the bosses
of the Makjubshi Gang.

335
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,002
This is fucking humiliating,

336
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:08,166
but I had to call them
because of you, asshole.

337
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:10,943
Damn it, who the hell
are you guys?

338
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:12,639
What do you want?

339
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:16,115
With that Country Chick,
no, with Ji-hoon...

340
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:20,614
No, I came to talk
to both of them.

341
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:22,952
Hey, what I want is that...

342
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:27,518
It's my turn. I brought her here,
so butt out.

343
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:31,190
Damn it, I'm the one
who went to the store.

344
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:35,634
You idiot, all you had to do
was have her deliver to you.

345
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:37,330
Stupid idiots.

346
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:40,130
Hey! Hey!

347
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:05,458
Are you okay?

348
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:08,828
What if I'm not?

349
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,898
I see you're still feisty.

350
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:21,878
Hey, I told you to stop smoking.
Out of breath already?

351
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:44,033
Very nice. Who gave it to you?

352
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,663
Stop it.

353
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,533
I thought you'd call me.

354
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:55,949
What's wrong with all your friends?
Get some new ones.

355
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:01,113
I sure do know
how to pick them right.

356
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:07,718
The necklace.

357
00:40:08,663 --> 00:40:10,494
Looks good on you.

358
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:26,940
Wait for me!

359
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:31,948
Wait for me, asshole!

360
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:53,698
Like I told you before,
what I want is that...

361
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:55,572
Go home, you bastard.

362
00:40:56,744 --> 00:40:58,075
But I have something to say!

363
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:05,176
Hurry and tell me who it is.
Is it me or this bitch? This bitch?

364
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:06,981
Yeah.

365
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:18,062
But I like you!

366
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:21,033
She's not the only one
who likes you!

367
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:23,127
I like you, too!

368
00:41:24,038 --> 00:41:27,371
I can be a better
girlfriend than her!

369
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:29,937
Hey, stop crying, damn it.

370
00:41:30,711 --> 00:41:32,406
Why do you bother people?

371
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:36,817
It's my hobby, why?

372
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:42,319
Go ahead first.

373
00:42:27,235 --> 00:42:29,999
First, we'll take care of them,
then it's our turn.

374
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:31,698
Do as you like.

375
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:35,335
Stop crying like a baby.

376
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:10,403
I heard a lot about you,
so show me what you got.

377
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:15,282
Shit, I've been showing it,
so where were you? I'm exhausted.

378
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,300
Can I ask you something?

379
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,813
Asking questions
is a good habit.

380
00:44:54,615 --> 00:44:55,912
Is this your skin?

381
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:57,974
Hey! Move those hands!

382
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:10,327
Ji-hoon, where are you going?
Please transfer to another school!

383
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:19,539
Stop staring, damn it.

384
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:21,871
Screw you.

385
00:45:24,412 --> 00:45:26,812
Do what she says.
