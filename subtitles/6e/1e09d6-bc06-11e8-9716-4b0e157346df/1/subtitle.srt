1
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,107
100 years ago,

2
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,978
this island in Taiwan...

3
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,214
had nothing

4
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,184
Only romance

5
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,523
Legend has it

6
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,551
There were two lovers

7
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,528
And one day

8
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,857
The man was fishing

9
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,302
His boat sank

10
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,401
The woman...

11
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,033
saw it onshore

12
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,208
She swam out

13
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,577
No one ever saw them again

14
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,110
Some say

15
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,317
they became dolphins

16
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:31,053
All dolphins around this island...

17
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,161
came from them

18
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,196
They all make...

19
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:51,036
"Bu... Bu" noises

20
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,784
Nice story?

21
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,827
So snooty

22
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,291
You told a horror story

23
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,637
Don't get involved

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,176
Have some melon

25
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,739
No

26
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:26,769
You're like...

27
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,379
those dolphins

28
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,038
So picky

29
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,410
You named me Bu

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,449
I've told you so often

31
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,088
Don't mix Mandarin...

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,420
with Cantonese

33
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,892
Bu's Mandarin and Cantonese...

34
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,122
are now both accented

35
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,062
That's awful

36
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,129
You teach her Mandarin then

37
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,134
Get off my case

38
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,937
That's Cantonese again

39
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,111
Which I don't speak

40
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,810
What did you say?

41
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,548
Tell me

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,851
Skipper Restaurant

43
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,577
Open bar, folks

44
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,904
One more round

45
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,346
Drink up

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,926
Go in and take a seat

47
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,430
Long time no see

48
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,532
One more round?

49
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,300
Not tonight

50
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,100
Can't afford it

51
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,879
On the house

52
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,073
Bu, 6 beers, on me

53
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,713
They come everyday

54
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,854
Never pay

55
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,452
Add water...

56
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,852
to the beer

57
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,959
That trick again?

58
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,786
Bu Yes?

59
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,362
Hurry

60
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,297
Here

61
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,162
Did you add water?

62
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,359
No!

63
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,365
No, very good

64
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,839
C'mon

65
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,533
Cheers

66
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,887
Why, Bu?

67
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,881
Idiot

68
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,854
You could've spared me

69
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,895
They sing

70
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,258
Watch TV

71
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,967
Or pick fights

72
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,302
This island

73
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,065
Has no room...

74
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,498
for romance

75
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,129
Done

76
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:34,965
Beautiful

77
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:35,828
I learned it...

78
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,401
from a magazine

79
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,308
Bu

80
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,742
I brought you something

81
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:51,972
I've never seen...

82
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,220
an oyster this big

83
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,014
Any pearls?

84
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,692
No

85
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,630
Must be expensive

86
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,124
NT$3,000

87
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,399
Thanks

88
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,938
And this

89
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,140
It's my friend's shop

90
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,536
He'll give us a discount

91
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,406
I'm...

92
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,940
Proposing?

93
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,811
No, I just want to...

94
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,248
Yes, I'm proposing

95
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,448
With...

96
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,455
a big oyster?

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,784
Of course not

98
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,258
The oyster's not...

99
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,891
Marry me

100
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,163
Okay

101
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,931
I'll consider it

102
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,780
Poor Longyi

103
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,386
This oyster's not cheap

104
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,219
He proposed to me

105
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,555
Really?

106
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,688
You love him?

107
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,597
Well, he's actually...

108
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,597
Not bad

109
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,767
Your answer

110
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,338
Shouldn't be over 4 words

111
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,099
You love him, or you don't

112
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,315
You left Hong Kong...

113
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,755
to marry dad, why?

114
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,285
He was quite a hunk

115
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,355
A good cook too

116
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,092
You're a good cook

117
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:51,696
He's better

118
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,937
He cooks with love

119
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,676
What's loving someone like?

120
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,248
You miss him

121
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,851
The sight of him thrills you

122
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,483
You ache

123
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,994
When he's gone

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,862
You could watch him forever

125
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,060
Even when he's sleeping

126
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,062
You're in love

127
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,607
If you feel like that

128
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,306
Okay?

129
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,482
You miss Hong Kong?

130
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,261
Yes, especially its Chinese Pot Rice

131
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:52,458
I see

132
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,662
You don't love Longyi

133
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,428
Take mama's advice

134
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,937
Trust your heart

135
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,706
Do what you have to do

136
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,011
Bu

137
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,556
Hey, kid

138
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,732
Got some news

139
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,296
Longyi proposed

140
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,169
Don't laugh

141
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,011
Somebody said

142
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,318
Men and women...

143
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,683
exist in pairs

144
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:54,022
Till separated on earth

145
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,754
Then they go through life

146
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,899
Searching for one another

147
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,162
Bu

148
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,337
Where are you going?

149
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,740
Bu!

150
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,790
I'm waiting for you!

151
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,266
Hong Kong, Albert?

152
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,601
How romantic!

153
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,690
You're telling me something?

154
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,368
You choose for me

155
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,120
You just decided my future

156
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,195
Excuse me

157
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,065
You know a good cafe?

158
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,940
Sure, we'll go together

159
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,266
Thanks

160
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,048
Typical Taiwanese!

161
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,249
Pardon me?

162
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,290
You speak Cantonese?

163
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,389
Surprised?

164
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,830
Never flown before?

165
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:26,800
It shows?

166
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,435
Yes

167
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,669
You can get lost in Hong Kong

168
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,604
I'll show you around

169
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,377
I know...

170
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,909
all the trendy spots

171
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,409
I have fans everywhere

172
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,053
I'm a fun guy

173
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,419
Okay?

174
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,062
What?

175
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,625
Are you twins?

176
00:13:58,904 --> 00:13:59,836
Please forgive me

177
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,838
Excuse me

178
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,044
Gangster's girlfriend

179
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,907
disappears

180
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,343
Morning, sir, working out?

181
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,881
No time

182
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,066
Bill, are you ready?

183
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,599
Good

184
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,765
Let's start

185
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,733
Morning, Mr. Chan

186
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,476
Any news from Wall Street?

187
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,511
Lion Fund...

188
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,549
is borrowing heavily

189
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,048
Even at...

190
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,916
a 20% interbank rate

191
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,719
Check the following

192
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,390
How many Nikkei Futures...

193
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,292
did they short?

194
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,296
Is Yen...

195
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,095
appreciating?

196
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,271
Is the lease for the US base...

197
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,566
in Japan expiring?

198
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,437
If both answer are affirmative

199
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,076
Buy whatever they sell

200
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,575
But this hedge fund

201
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,874
Is run by 2 Nobel Prize economists

202
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,575
Should be invincible

203
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,144
They're too greedy

204
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,114
on margin trading

205
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,254
Leveraging 10 times their worth

206
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,517
They're doomed

207
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,017
So go ahead

208
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,161
Yes, Mr. Chan

209
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,088
Thank you

210
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,497
Send this with 100 roses...

211
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,264
to Carman

212
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,232
During office hours

213
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,777
Didn't you break up?

214
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,645
We're still friends

215
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,743
Find someone and

216
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,786
settle down

217
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:30,984
Like who?

218
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,614
Those women around you

219
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,190
All so beautiful and elegant

220
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,254
Too elegant for me

221
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,895
What do you want?

222
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,295
Someone amusing

223
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,967
Make yourself at home

224
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,932
That bottle floated to Taiwan!

225
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,938
And you came...

226
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,079
all that way

227
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,106
How brave and romantic

228
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,514
However...

229
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,148
What?

230
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,827
What?

231
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,328
I'm gay

232
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,970
No

233
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,306
Yes

234
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,207
Really?

235
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,376
Really

236
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,507
No

237
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,472
Yes

238
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,172
Honest?

239
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,941
Honest

240
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,579
The bottle's for your boyfriend?

241
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,320
Ex—boyfriend

242
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:46,958
What?

243
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,024
Ex—boyfriend

244
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,519
Such a waste

245
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,195
VVhy?

246
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,691
You're a hunk

247
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,425
I'm not

248
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,878
That's stunning

249
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,407
That's what inspired you

250
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,678
I moved here because of it

251
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,590
Find a motel tonight

252
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,428
Fly home tomorrow

253
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,822
I've never traveled

254
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,695
This is a first

255
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,199
Think I'll stay a while

256
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,130
But Hong Kong...

257
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,697
is boring

258
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,599
Fly back tomorrow

259
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,839
My friend said

260
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,336
Hong Kong's fun

261
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,110
Great restaurants too

262
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,050
I'll find you...

263
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,117
a motel

264
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,019
I can't afford one

265
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,018
Hands off Wait

266
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,426
Let me stay here

267
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,152
Women can't stay here

268
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,387
I'll go nuts

269
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,398
Please

270
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,399
Sorry Please

271
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,968
I came all this way

272
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,911
To such a big let down

273
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,743
I don't deserve this

274
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,311
Goodbye

275
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:30,994
Bu

276
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:31,527
What?

277
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,493
Your suitcase

278
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,579
Your bag

279
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,551
I can't stand crying

280
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,859
Makes me feel so guilty

281
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,387
Okay, stay

282
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,699
I'll be your aide, in whatever you do

283
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,198
I'm a makeup artist

284
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,800
Best...

285
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,265
in Hong Kong

286
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:27,943
Exquisite

287
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:32,514
That's it

288
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,504
Hold that

289
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,346
Good

290
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,831
I'm starving

291
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,028
We'll wrap soon

292
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,004
How much longer?

293
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,066
6 hours

294
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,667
What?

295
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,847
Keep that door shut

296
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,873
We're reloading

297
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,775
You'll fog the film

298
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,885
You sound so nervous on the phone
What's the emergency?

299
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,193
No... no emergency

300
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,089
I just miss you. You don't miss me?

301
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,563
Sit down, I'll get you a drink

302
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,702
Tell me, what's going on?

303
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,804
Maybe you'd better go

304
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,734
C.N. you're cruising and

305
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,167
didn't invite me?

306
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,808
Why bother, here you are

307
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,768
The press says you're romancing my girl

308
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,436
You believe them?

309
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,040
Grow up, LW

310
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,010
Is it true?

311
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,275
Yes

312
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,282
We've been competing since grade school

313
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,132
You've been interested in...

314
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,235
our stock lately

315
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,903
I'm interested in all stocks,

316
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,164
not just yours

317
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,773
My associates and I

318
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,703
Hold a majority of the shares

319
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,539
You can't touch my company

320
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:44,508
We'll see

321
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,646
You're on my yacht

322
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,284
Dating my girl

323
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,957
And you talk to me like this

324
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,255
Why did you want me here?

325
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,330
For an apology

326
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,162
To make it easier on you

327
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,130
I'm leaving now

328
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,572
Call me...

329
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,604
to apologize in...

330
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:11,371
5 minutes

331
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,602
What time is it?

332
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,307
5:30

333
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,642
Why wear...

334
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,546
a watch

335
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,809
That can't tell time

336
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,049
I like the diamonds

337
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:26,821
Watch him

338
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,723
If he doesn't call me in five

339
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,593
Throw him overboard

340
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,397
But give him a buoy

341
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,293
Yes, boss

342
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:36,490
Call me

343
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,446
Bye, boss

344
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,648
Call him

345
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,075
Or you'll get wet

346
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,017
Make it snappy

347
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,623
I've got a hot date

348
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,653
Don't force us to do it

349
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:04,856
Get a buoy

350
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,758
Right

351
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,156
Come

352
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,391
Hands off

353
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,223
Easy

354
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,629
Almost

355
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:23,904
Bye

356
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,408
Here comes the buoy

357
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,278
It's Fatty

358
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,217
Fatty fell over

359
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,984
Don't go

360
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,397
Help him up

361
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,534
Over there

362
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,636
Scared me

363
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,776
Yo u o kay?

364
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:34,677
I'm fine

365
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,562
Call you

366
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:01,607
Where is he?

367
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,982
Where is he?

368
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,387
Yo u o kay?

369
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,960
Don't fall over again

370
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,897
You! He's here!

371
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:25,865
In the rear

372
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,002
Help...

373
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,370
Hold tight

374
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,339
Close

375
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,171
You see him?

376
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,474
No

377
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,284
Look again

378
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,006
Over there

379
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,817
He got away

380
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:17,613
Wait

381
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,581
The boss wanted him...

382
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,589
overboard with a buoy

383
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:22,952
Job's done, right?

384
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,126
Right

385
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,885
It's a wrap

386
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,115
Thanks

387
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,757
Yo u o kay?

388
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,658
You're...

389
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,429
Name's Bu

390
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,360
Bu?

391
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,168
You a refugee?

392
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,799
Yes

393
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:12,999
From Vietnam?

394
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,803
Right again

395
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,179
How many of you?

396
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,842
Just me, why?

397
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,276
Who's driving?

398
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:36,932
Give me a hand

399
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,700
I can't, I'm starving

400
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,497
Aren't you?

401
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,272
No, but I could use a snack

402
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,953
Let's talk

403
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,113
so I forget the hunger

404
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,688
About what?

405
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,397
What do you like?

406
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,092
Nothing?

407
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,969
Not even cars and women?

408
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,302
Don't just smile

409
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,004
Okay, what don't you like?

410
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,048
Nosy people

411
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,429
What don't you like?

412
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,504
Growing up,

413
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,669
I like being naughty

414
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:51,604
Nosy?

415
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,143
Naughty

416
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,340
Naughty

417
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,342
And no one...

418
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,472
pampers you anymore

419
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,713
What do you like?

420
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,022
A shower when I'm sweaty

421
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,150
Snap out of bed...

422
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,185
to a cup of coffee

423
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,295
I'd like one now

424
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,697
Hong Kong stars are lovely

425
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,129
Stars are...

426
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,867
the same everywhere

427
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,841
If you care to look at them

428
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,508
What?

429
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,119
Shooting star!

430
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:36,549
Really?

431
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,451
Mom said when you see one

432
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,058
Touch your pocket and make a wish

433
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,124
And it'll come true

434
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,119
But I'm out of luck, no pocket

435
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,229
Another one

436
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,670
What's your wish?

437
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,671
Can't tell you

438
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,351
Or it won't come true

439
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,025
I'm so sleepy

440
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,209
A boat! Help!

441
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,013
Over here!

442
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,625
The Silicon Valley stocks?

443
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,700
They'll go even higher

444
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,701
Check one thing

445
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,237
Does LW control...

446
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,440
his company's shares?

447
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,923
Buy me a new mobile

448
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,534
It drowned

449
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,912
There's no transport...

450
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,571
around here

451
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,080
I'll give you a ride

452
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,681
Just tell me where I am

453
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,946
and I'll walk back

454
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,953
We're out

455
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,752
in the boonies, Miss

456
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,252
Name's Bu

457
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,587
B '2
oo. Bu!

458
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,322
Just get in

459
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,090
Sure

460
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,201
Not you, this lady here

461
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,169
There are only 2 seats

462
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,505
I know

463
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,376
Here's 20 bucks

464
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,140
Around the corner...

465
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,078
are buses and cabs

466
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,451
Compulsive liar

467
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,676
Come in

468
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,117
Huge place, you live alone?

469
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,376
There's a butler

470
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,947
Must get crowded

471
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:07,948
Wait here

472
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,056
Can I look around?

473
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,023
Help yourself

474
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:10,784
Thanks

475
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,606
I'm starving

476
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,918
Some food please!

477
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,554
Need something?

478
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,622
Fish food

479
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,088
They're electronic fish

480
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,661
Come over here

481
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,368
Why electronic fish?

482
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,494
I never change the water

483
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,436
Fish never die, it's perfect

484
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,640
And if the power's out?

485
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,479
You invite friends over?

486
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:38,743
Don't have any

487
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,080
So boring, and lonely

488
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,125
Now what?

489
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,159
You like to fight?

490
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,163
Some golf,

491
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,232
some race horses

492
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,668
I box and work out

493
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,470
What's the octopus for?

494
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:07,944
You're so nosy

495
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,273
Sorry

496
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,851
This should fit, change in there

497
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,404
Betty, call me a cab

498
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,902
20 minutes? Great

499
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,363
There's a room...

500
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,933
behind the mirror

501
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,206
How would I have known?

502
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,238
Hungry?

503
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,441
Starving

504
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,978
Me too

505
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,984
Any Chinese pot rice?

506
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,814
What?

507
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,871
Best take out food ever

508
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,873
My favorite

509
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,036
A fancy kitchen and you don't cook?

510
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,803
I hate the smell

511
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,047
Don't stare. Eat up

512
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,349
Sure

513
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:14,400
Now what?

514
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,239
You're amusing when you eat

515
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,076
Are you rich?

516
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,444
I guess so

517
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,145
What do you do?

518
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:28,646
I'm into trash

519
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,287
C'mon

520
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:31,778
No, I sell trash

521
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,748
Be that way

522
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,934
Can I have a soda?

523
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,430
Juice is better for you

524
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,765
Bu took the lift down

525
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,234
What's wrong?

526
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,424
Stop moaning

527
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,733
You know

528
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,768
That bottle's very special

529
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:00,875
So special that...

530
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,106
all of a sudden

531
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,145
I'm feeding and sheltering you

532
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,078
Just like that

533
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,318
Remember I told you about...

534
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,454
C.N.? More than once

535
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,783
Last night...

536
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,256
You told me that too

537
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,662
I think he's... nice

538
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:21,592
Nice?

539
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,464
These magazines are published weekly

540
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,334
And he changes girlfriends just as often

541
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,377
He's not nice, he's a playboy

542
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,341
Let's see

543
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,478
An ex—girlfriend says

544
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:45,252
He doesn't say sweet words

545
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,817
But he's a romantic man

546
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,586
He appears stem and talks tough

547
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,256
Inside he's like a kid

548
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,225
He's competitive and chases novelty

549
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,203
Never regrets any decision

550
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,105
With him...

551
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,637
You feel insecure

552
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,744
Meaning?

553
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,372
Chases novelty, so he fools around

554
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,506
No regrets,

555
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,182
so he enjoys dumping women

556
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,319
Maybe those women deserved it

557
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,953
They were insecure...

558
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,648
to begin with

559
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,051
Spare me

560
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,689
Hong Kong's boring anyway

561
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,126
Going home?

562
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,469
No, C.N. is fun

563
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,331
You have to hook him first

564
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:39,670
Can't just walk up

565
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,640
And take off your clothes

566
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,742
That sure won't work

567
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,472
But you never know

568
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:46,974
He's competitive and

569
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,278
chases novelty

570
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,554
I have a plan, I need your help

571
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,416
No way

572
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,757
Please

573
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,023
Sorry

574
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:00,855
Please tell me

575
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:01,861
where your daughter is

576
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,826
She found a bottle

577
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,367
She's in Hong Kong

578
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,703
I have to get Bu back

579
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,371
Chow Yun Fat!

580
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,510
Mr. Chow

581
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,873
Wrong guy

582
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,017
You speak Mandarin?

583
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,216
I'm not Chow Yun Fat

584
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,048
Don't try to fool me

585
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,951
Sir, is he Chow Yun Fat?

586
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,255
Mr. Chow, you're back!

587
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,653
Fresh form Hollywood?

588
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,023
Please sign Can I take a picture?

589
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,722
You mind? OK

590
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,567
But... 1,2,3... say cheese

591
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,002
My turn, miss

592
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,637
Point a gun at me

593
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,243
Ready, 1,2 Ready1,2,3...

594
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,707
Thank you, Mr. Chow

595
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,842
Give me a hug

596
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,121
Thank you Mr. Chow Thank you

597
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,721
I'll send you the photos

598
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,189
Bye You're so sweet

599
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,122
Same as the photo

600
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,283
Print me a copy

601
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,758
He's such a hunk Bye

602
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,796
Bye

603
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:12,765
My bag!

604
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,808
We checked LW's company

605
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,305
Last year,

606
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,810
rumover grew 13%

607
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,743
Profit: over HK$1 billion

608
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,745
Stock price is undervalued by 30%

609
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,313
We have acquired...

610
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,683
16% of the company

611
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,219
LW and his associates...

612
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,658
still hold 65%

613
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,022
But...

614
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,766
they're not selling

615
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,527
Dump all my stocks

616
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,471
If we dump them,

617
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,767
the price will plunge

618
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:56,106
We bought high, we'll take a huge loss

619
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,581
Just do it

620
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:02,819
I need to see K.K.

621
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,814
Yes, sir

622
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:05,517
Who's K.K.?

623
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,485
Head of Environmental Protection

624
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,919
Going up or down?

625
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,685
I was seeing friends upstairs

626
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,053
There's no upstairs

627
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,088
Really?

628
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,463
Actually they live downstairs

629
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,356
Names?

630
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,265
I forgot

631
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,763
So quiet here

632
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,574
Can you get an 80% mortgage?

633
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,266
You messed up my wall

634
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,304
Excuse me?

635
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,617
Look!

636
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,354
Easy there

637
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,060
Let go

638
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,030
Who sent you?

639
00:48:58,902 --> 00:48:59,698
Let go first

640
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:02,967
Like my writing?

641
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,379
Enough. I don't know kungfu

642
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,881
I'm just a messenger

643
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:19,747
Message?

644
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,451
My back pocket

645
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:35,906
Bully. You messed up my arm

646
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:36,895
Happy reading

647
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:39,808
Gangster's girlfriend...

648
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,568
disappears

649
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:47,577
What happened?

650
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,577
Fell down some stairs

651
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:50,412
Yo u o kay?

652
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,018
I'll live

653
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,648
Will he buy...

654
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,155
I'll a gangster's girlfriend?

655
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,518
How should I know?

656
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,220
Will it work?

657
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,753
Of course

658
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,089
What's next?

659
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,359
Showtime

660
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,900
Where are your pals?

661
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,336
You know we're bad

662
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,037
We're here to waste you

663
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,580
React!

664
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,411
My boyfriend... Speak Mandarin

665
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:25,043
Is a Taiwanese gangster

666
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,689
The sworn enemy of our boss

667
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,882
He wants you defaced

668
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,959
Frog, your turn

669
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,752
Believe it or not

670
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,927
You're front page news

671
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:38,061
Everyone's looking for you now

672
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,600
Yes. Looking awesome

673
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,490
Yo u o kay?

674
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,097
Yes, and you?

675
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:13,865
It's you!

676
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:14,570
Yo u o kay?

677
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:15,396
Yes

678
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:21,876
I don't know these goons

679
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:22,636
What?

680
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:23,411
Nothing

681
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,207
You can't be ID'ed

682
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,338
They're damn good actors

683
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,480
Back off

684
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:13,688
Stay here

685
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,916
Yeah, or I'll kill myself

686
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,318
You're bleeding

687
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,125
We'll spare you today

688
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,263
Don't provoke him

689
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,529
Cops will go after them

690
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:27,360
Not us

691
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:30,540
Hi, there

692
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:37,176
Sunny, sit... Sunny, sit

693
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:38,509
Thanks

694
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,744
Someone reported a fight

695
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:41,645
We were attacked

696
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,010
They leave any evidence?

697
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,411
Baseball bats

698
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,086
Sunny, smell

699
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,817
Any clues?

700
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,103
Sunny, you're clueless

701
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,174
Let's get help

702
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,704
My site, very safe

703
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,845
It's so trashy

704
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,517
I told you I sell trash

705
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,481
Expensive stuff too

706
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,786
Expensive? Trash is trash

707
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:24,754
Before you were...

708
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,119
a Vietnamese refugee

709
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,724
Now you're...

710
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,056
A Taiwanese gangster's girlfriend

711
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,999
So who are you, really?

712
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,300
A dangerous woman

713
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:36,436
Scared?

714
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,071
Never

715
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,203
Thrilled to be with me?

716
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,913
How'd you land the girlfriend's part?

717
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,415
I lived near a police station

718
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,453
with posters of wanted criminals

719
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:00,291
One of them was a hunk

720
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,221
I saw his poster everyday

721
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,631
And I fell in love

722
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:07,664
And?

723
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,837
I found him, stole his heart

724
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,266
How was he?

725
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,906
Cute, a great dancer

726
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,607
Really romantic

727
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,549
For being a dancer?

728
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,514
You dance?

729
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:29,717
Of course

730
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:33,794
This?

731
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:36,524
Sure

732
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:39,595
Tango?

733
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,069
That too

734
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,103
So common, nothing more exciting?

735
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,843
Sure Really?

736
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,713
Teach me

737
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,414
You'll be scared

738
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,550
No way

739
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,078
Hold me

740
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,717
Give me your legs

741
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:02,923
Right

742
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,585
Ready?

743
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:08,661
Help!

744
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,462
Exciting enough?

745
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,127
Yes

746
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,229
No more?

747
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,298
You aren't scared?

748
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:19,167
Never

749
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:20,776
More moves?

750
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,613
Just hold tight and

751
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:27,544
stay still

752
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,009
Enjoy the variations

753
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:29,649
Really? Okay?

754
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:30,376
Okay...

755
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,212
There

756
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,479
Run, 1, 2, 3

757
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,195
Wow! This is fun

758
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,031
Man's so busy

759
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,633
Making trash

760
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,437
The recycling business is a gold mine

761
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:55,510
They say...

762
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,475
What others abandon, I take

763
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,210
You did well last time

764
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,542
Slapped Lion Fund in the face

765
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,422
They all know you're my protege

766
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:07,519
I'm flattered

767
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:08,416
Thank you

768
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,492
Don't thank me, thank yourself

769
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,529
Any new plans?

770
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:19,393
I heard you're buying LW's company

771
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,429
You know

772
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,570
what's the best win?

773
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,406
Winning one's battle...

774
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,607
with the enemy's respect

775
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,714
Stock Exchange's closed

776
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:42,619
And?

777
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,586
Our stock dropped 20%

778
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:47,889
Closed at $6.50

779
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,429
Our drop in asset value?

780
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,434
Over 2 billion

781
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,872
It's Chan,

782
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,167
he's dumping our shares

783
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,242
What's the news on him?

784
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,377
Rumors are he wants...

785
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,880
to buy our company

786
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,512
Then...

787
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,749
why dump his shares?

788
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,584
After buying them so high?

789
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:23,995
Boss

790
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,237
What happened to you?

791
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,131
We wanted to get even. We ambushed Chan

792
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,272
Was he hurt?

793
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,309
Not a scratch

794
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,909
Thank God

795
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,109
Else...

796
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,475
I'd blame myself

797
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:40,940
And if...

798
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,483
Well,

799
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:44,915
you actually were hurt

800
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,947
And see, I feel guilty

801
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,682
It was your dad's idea

802
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,919
He screwed up

803
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,056
Ordering an ambush

804
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,955
Why not shoot Chan in the back?

805
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,730
That's much faster

806
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,230
Let's do it

807
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,439
No, it's wrong, it's cowardly

808
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,802
Challenge him openly

809
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,176
Right

810
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,876
Yes!

811
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,252
Let's hire a fighter from overseas

812
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:22,617
Tougher

813
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,790
Smaller

814
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:27,793
And...

815
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:29,663
Handsomer than Chan

816
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,125
He'll be devastated

817
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,234
What's that?

818
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:46,715
The signal means "Dismissed". Beat it

819
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:48,179
Tricky signals

820
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,557
Have you seen her?

821
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,797
That's Mary

822
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,059
No, that's Bunny

823
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:06,427
No, that's Mary

824
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,003
That's Bunny, come with me

825
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,140
No, that way

826
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,100
No

827
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,403
Another Bunny?

828
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,943
A masseuse

829
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,806
A masseuse?

830
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,051
Why not?

831
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,139
Oh my God, what's he doing?

832
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:05,924
Albert!

833
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,526
Do I look pretty?

834
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,030
Yes

835
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:15,166
What?

836
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,472
Your outfit

837
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,732
My Sunday best

838
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:22,935
Go to...

839
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,306
Jean—Paul's Boutique

840
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,777
I'll call him,

841
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,175
let him dress you

842
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,085
You feed, shelter,

843
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,084
and clothe me

844
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,153
You're my guardian angel

845
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,281
Your wish is...

846
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,650
my command

847
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:38,518
Bye

848
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:41,061
What?

849
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,531
How should I behave at dinner?

850
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,726
You're playing a gangster's lady

851
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,269
Use method acting

852
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,333
Teach me

853
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:54,541
Just act snooty

854
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,103
Feed, shelter, and clothe her

855
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,873
I'm an angel

856
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,547
She forgot something?

857
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,612
Yes?

858
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:11,155
Help!

859
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,089
It's you!

860
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:19,167
Where's Bu?

861
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,169
Please tell me where she is

862
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:40,880
Mr. Chan

863
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:41,579
Thanks

864
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:46,928
Mr. Chan
