1
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:02,431
What's this?

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:04,139
Excuse me

3
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,339
The lady's so lovely

4
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:09,069
She deserves some wind effect

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,111
You look gorgeous

6
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:13,111
I know

7
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:24,824
Well?

8
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,123
A vintage wine, from '82

9
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:37,197
But I can also tell

10
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:41,177
The grape—picker was born in '60

11
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:44,777
Let's order

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,052
You order

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,058
You do Chinese Pot Rice?

14
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:58,158
Just kidding

15
00:00:58,663 --> 00:00:59,493
Thank God!

16
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:06,930
You got a thing about people
watching you eat?

17
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:11,438
We don't want to be crowded

18
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:18,513
Excuse me

19
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:22,346
You booked the whole place?

20
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:25,280
Just you and me

21
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,015
I was hoping

22
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,557
To run into celebrities

23
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:32,985
You must really...

24
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,722
hate crowds

25
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,161
What about your friends?

26
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,604
Here comes one

27
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,532
Mr. Lo, you can't go in

28
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:52,578
Why'd you do it?

29
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:55,781
Dump my company's shares?

30
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:57,910
call me tomorrow

31
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:03,154
You're hurting me

32
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:05,191
And yourself too

33
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:08,365
Mr. Lo, please leave

34
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:09,697
Sir

35
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,632
You look intelligent

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,396
lam intelligent

37
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:15,838
Then stay home and think

38
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,531
Devise a way...

39
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,540
to save your company

40
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:22,736
Who are you?

41
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:24,272
C.N.'s friend

42
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,550
He booked the whole place for me

43
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:29,153
You're disturbing us

44
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:31,782
That's so rude

45
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,356
Let's talk outside

46
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:39,527
We've talked enough

47
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:42,329
See you outside

48
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,705
That signal means "Follow me"

49
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:51,264
Wrong again?

50
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:57,707
You're snooty

51
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,347
So are my friends

52
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:01,882
it rubs off

53
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,445
You have to go?

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,752
It'll just take a minute

55
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,235
C.N.

56
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:25,668
Watch your back

57
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:37,215
Watch your back

58
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:39,448
I called,

59
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:42,520
cleared it with your boss

60
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,394
I'm meeting Mr. Chan

61
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:47,326
Close the parking lot for us

62
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,660
Relax, I'm footing the bill

63
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:51,493
Fine, Mr. Lo

64
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,369
You heard Mr. Lo, move out

65
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,735
Have fun, Mr. Chan

66
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:00,235
LW

67
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:01,976
What's up?

68
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:04,142
I want you to meet someone

69
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:06,176
I hired him from overseas

70
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:08,283
Ladies and gentlemen

71
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,985
Alan

72
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,019
An undefeated light—weight champion

73
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:24,834
He'll fight you one—on—one

74
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:27,900
But...

75
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:29,471
I'm a middle—weight

76
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,166
Too much of an edge

77
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,640
But if you lose

78
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:38,244
Think of the disgrace

79
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,544
Grow up

80
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:43,811
Nuts

81
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:45,719
Play this music for me

82
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,788
No problem

83
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:40,409
You have no choice

84
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,038
Why the gloves?

85
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:46,407
This is a boxing match

86
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:47,618
I'm not...

87
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:48,478
into crippling people

88
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,679
With gloves, it won't hurt?

89
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:53,153
Sure it'll hurt

90
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,019
But much less

91
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:00,556
All set

92
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:01,991
Watch your head

93
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:05,061
Music

94
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,304
Knock me down anyway you can

95
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:10,031
But no dirty tricks

96
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:15,906
They say you're a great fighter. Come on

97
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,682
Look! They're not gonna
let you leave here without a fight

98
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:29,193
You ask for it

99
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:31,451
Are you ready?

100
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:32,254
Of course

101
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:36,828
Alan's losing bigtime

102
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:39,568
No, Alan's just testing him

103
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,361
He's wearing Chan down

104
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:59,653
Wait Good

105
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:09,492
Changing gloves, why?

106
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,034
Even the odds

107
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:12,868
Bigger the glove,

108
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:14,332
bigger the handicap

109
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:17,333
Chan's punches are soft

110
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,409
I've come a long way,

111
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,206
I don't want a short game

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,687
Every boxer trains...

113
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:32,046
to his own music

114
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:33,087
When he fights,

115
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,952
it give him rhythm

116
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:36,987
And rhythm paces his steps

117
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,892
Chan has no rhythm

118
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,368
He's controlled by Alan

119
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:47,502
You're an expert

120
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:48,229
You should be fighting

121
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,264
Right

122
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,503
C.N. and I used to box

123
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,006
But I always lost

124
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:54,705
So I quit and became a...

125
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:55,938
Commentator

126
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:56,772
Wow!

127
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,481
You like that better?

128
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,678
Sure. I sound so invincible

129
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,318
But I'm just like you guys

130
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,413
Helpless

131
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:15,359
Chan used to have brilliant moves

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,430
Now he's a mess

133
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:20,533
Buying companies...

134
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:21,467
instead of training

135
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,630
Loser!

136
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:55,834
Chan's nervous, it's over

137
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:03,933
Good hit, but not enough power

138
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,291
Come on

139
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:04,723
Yo u o kay?

140
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,337
You win

141
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:12,267
We won

142
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,976
Let's kick him while he's down

143
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,405
Good idea

144
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:21,478
Don't be...

145
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,917
such cowards

146
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,053
Ganging up on a downed man

147
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:28,157
There's no honor in that

148
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,358
You're good

149
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:37,959
Get the car

150
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,673
My joy is done. He's good

151
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:55,280
C.N., you okay?

152
00:11:57,755 --> 00:11:59,416
You must be delighted

153
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:03,860
No, but I thought I would be

154
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:09,565
You need help?

155
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:14,400
Damn it

156
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:22,168
C.N., call me

157
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:57,809
You didn't leave?

158
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,782
You asked me to wait

159
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,950
I came to find you

160
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,813
Did they gang up on you?

161
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,185
No, one—on—one, I lost

162
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:15,861
You'll get used to it

163
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:18,726
Just kidding

164
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:22,904
Start training tomorrow,
you'll beat them

165
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:27,675
I'll train, but not for them

166
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:30,140
For what then?

167
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:35,042
A strong body, a quick mind

168
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,182
I haven't trained in ages

169
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:42,690
Your huge gym, what a waste

170
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:45,859
I hate training alone

171
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,557
I'll join you

172
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:54,293
Why be so nice to me?

173
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,665
You're rich

174
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,734
You're cute when you smile

175
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,247
You looked grouchyjust now

176
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:07,342
That's why you lost

177
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,517
Stick with smiling

178
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:13,548
These clothes and makeup don't fit you

179
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:19,328
Take tomorrow off

180
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:20,256
VVhy?

181
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:21,892
Say yes first

182
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:22,497
VVhy?

183
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:23,992
Say yes first

184
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:26,127
Yes, now why?

185
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:28,266
Play!

186
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:32,842
Memories are so many

187
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:38,074
Anticipation I now dare to indulge

188
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,018
I sketch a hazy future

189
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:48,357
Knowing this illusion is love

190
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:53,026
The tides of a lifetime

191
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:58,263
Widen the shores slowly

192
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:03,196
Quietly you and I meet

193
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:08,804
Our love proves life is ever changing

194
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:15,112
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

195
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:20,087
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

196
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:23,090
Like eternity

197
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:28,690
Is the night really still young?

198
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:35,299
Currents change courses too
(We fall in love)

199
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:40,307
The crowds catch up with us (Finally)

200
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:44,277
I can think no more

201
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,646
But this love

202
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:51,651
Links the sea with the sky

203
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:19,712
My eyes have been raining

204
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:24,785
I can't hold on with both hands

205
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:29,588
I cry as we seek happiness

206
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:35,192
You're just like a shooting star

207
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:39,935
Those happy moments

208
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:45,236
Lock you between my brows

209
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:49,943
No matter how the world dazzles

210
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:55,712
It pales next to your eternal splendor

211
00:16:56,553 --> 00:17:02,082
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

212
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,855
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

213
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,090
Like eternity

214
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:15,797
Is the night really still young?

215
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,236
You love me?

216
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:20,809
I think you're quite...

217
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:23,344
Answer the question

218
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:25,310
The fact is...

219
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:27,416
C'mon

220
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:31,212
Answer in 4 words or less

221
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:34,816
I love you

222
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,587
Or I don't

223
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,249
When did you slip in?

224
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:06,618
I'm in love

225
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:12,196
Love's a dream
that leaves only emptiness

226
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:17,794
So don't get fooled by love

227
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:22,732
You're such an optimist

228
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,774
I have news for you

229
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:28,107
What?

230
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:29,575
Longyi's here

231
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:33,915
He almost strangled me

232
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:36,413
But I calmed him down

233
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:38,447
He's been drunk ever since

234
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,453
My fault

235
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:45,493
No way

236
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:48,666
Listen, love is not sympathy

237
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:51,093
You're tangled up...

238
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,259
with Chan

239
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:53,427
Don't let Longyi see you

240
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:00,877
Wine please No

241
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:02,274
Wait

242
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:03,445
Let go

243
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,575
No

244
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:05,775
Kitchen time

245
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:06,508
Kitchen

246
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:09,811
I need...

247
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,290
What?

248
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:19,189
I need a glass

249
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:20,763
I'll get it

250
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:23,227
Go inside

251
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:26,029
No pushing

252
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:31,205
Albert

253
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:35,210
Where's the opener?

254
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:39,447
Albert

255
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:42,185
Smooth move

256
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:44,983
So cold!

257
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:46,055
Albert

258
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:49,385
Now what?

259
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:53,629
I need the opener

260
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,627
Where is it?

261
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:00,233
Hurry!

262
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:06,776
What's that?

263
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:11,115
The family above us

264
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:12,773
Has a brat

265
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,453
It's from above us?

266
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,988
Where else?

267
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:34,705
It's from above us

268
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:38,068
It's that brat again

269
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,372
Opener

270
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:41,775
Forget it

271
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,983
Drink it this way

272
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:48,613
Wait Come

273
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:50,621
Drink with me

274
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:54,451
Yo u o kay?

275
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:58,160
I must tell C.N.

276
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,558
A game...

277
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:00,891
is fun

278
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,330
Till its secret is revealed

279
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:07,432
I know he loves me

280
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:11,909
He skips work to be with me

281
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:18,212
I'm like a child again

282
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,385
Getting so attached to him

283
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,883
I see something beautiful

284
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:25,917
I want it for him

285
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:29,759
Something happens, I want to tell him

286
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm so happy

287
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:34,761
And...

288
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:35,761
so cold!

289
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:38,059
You're in love

290
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:41,965
Need something?

291
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:43,836
Sake

292
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:45,302
Finish your wine first

293
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:47,069
I want sake

294
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:49,607
Just wait outside Sake

295
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,177
Hang on

296
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:57,118
Excuse me

297
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:07,330
Let's sing

298
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:09,591
This is not a Karaoke bar

299
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:11,899
We don't have time

300
00:22:12,104 --> 00:22:13,128
We'll split this

301
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:13,862
Too much

302
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:15,538
Not at all

303
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:17,069
Enough

304
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,938
Cheers

305
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:24,515
You'll get drunk

306
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:28,710
Drink it

307
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:34,687
1... 2... 3...

308
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,792
Down!

309
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:48,666
Still kicking. Thank God

310
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:11,357
She's safe here

311
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:17,930
Here she is

312
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,072
Gloria, Bu

313
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:33,509
Gloria's a good friend

314
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,651
She's the one impersonating me?

315
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:37,520
Yes!

316
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:38,587
Not bad

317
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,687
You knew all along

318
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:50,594
Why con me?

319
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:52,162
You started it

320
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,300
All the love I felt between us

321
00:23:57,476 --> 00:24:02,106
That was just an act?

322
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,905
Our happiness was no act

323
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:06,740
If you like,

324
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:08,951
stay in Hong Kong

325
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:11,920
What am I?

326
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:15,187
One of your women?

327
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:22,692
The bottle sent me to you

328
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:26,935
A fairy tale becomes...

329
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,401
a nightmare

330
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:49,021
My big mouth

331
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:50,886
No

332
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:52,752
Get her back

333
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:53,587
No

334
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,497
Weren't we on the same plane?

335
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:03,305
Back to Taiwan?

336
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:04,064
Yes

337
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:05,633
You had fun?

338
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:07,239
It was okay

339
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,444
I bought a lot,

340
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,648
what about you?

341
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:15,583
I bought a story

342
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:17,284
A story!

343
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:18,819
Is it in an office building?

344
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:33,567
The government passed a law...

345
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:35,330
prohibiting the use...

346
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:36,967
of non—bio—degradable

347
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:39,076
styrofoam

348
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:40,138
LW's stock...

349
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:43,372
dropped drastically

350
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:46,282
From $6.80 to $1.20 a share

351
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:48,175
Major stockholders,

352
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:49,615
are dumping them

353
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,546
You knew...

354
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:52,622
the law would be passed?

355
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,722
It was only a matter of time

356
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:57,725
Should we borrow money?

357
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:59,193
Up to you guys

358
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,256
Mr. Chan,

359
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:02,832
you shouldn't buy a company
that's going down the drain

360
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:04,999
Just to...

361
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,102
get even

362
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:07,666
I won't

363
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,100
That's all for today

364
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:10,832
The acquisition...

365
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:13,000
is a go?

366
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:13,970
I'll let you know

367
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:39,355
Love is like falling maples

368
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:41,791
Like what?

369
00:27:43,001 --> 00:27:47,870
Like falling maples

370
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,631
What does that mean?

371
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:51,305
I don't know

372
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:56,170
I've never seen you like this

373
00:27:56,348 --> 00:27:57,906
Paper everywhere

374
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,117
Just do...

375
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:02,185
what you have to do

376
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:03,547
Again?

377
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:05,215
Forget it

378
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:07,082
What?

379
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:08,823
Nothing

380
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,550
Leave me alone

381
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:17,059
Fine, be that way

382
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,500
You broke it?

383
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:22,532
Good guess

384
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:24,431
Sir

385
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:25,405
Call 911

386
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,699
They'll stop me

387
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:27,704
Just call

388
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:39,017
See

389
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:39,987
What do you want?

390
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:41,518
You ruined our boss,

391
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:42,725
lost us our jobs

392
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:45,018
We came for payback

393
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:48,760
Mr. Chan

394
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:52,460
I heard you're back in training

395
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:53,261
Yes, lam

396
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:54,433
Rematch?

397
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,964
Mr. Lo sent you?

398
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,175
Mr. Lo is broke

399
00:28:57,943 --> 00:28:59,205
It's not about money

400
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,412
Not now

401
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:04,507
You got no choice

402
00:29:08,453 --> 00:29:10,546
You really enjoy fighting, don't you?

403
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:13,422
Only with the best

404
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:23,359
What are they talking about?

405
00:29:23,902 --> 00:29:25,301
You never learned English...

406
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,266
in school?

407
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:27,369
C'mon, tell me

408
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:28,963
No

409
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:34,042
Okay

410
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:40,880
Rules?

411
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:41,950
No rules

412
00:29:44,189 --> 00:29:47,818
Anything goes, but no dirty tricks

413
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:57,629
You like white

414
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:08,909
Are you sure?

415
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:11,479
I'm sure

416
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:34,595
Good training

417
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:30,846
Wait

418
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,599
Now what?

419
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:57,037
"What's you okay?" In English?

420
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:58,709
Are you okay?

421
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:00,380
Are you okay?

422
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:03,719
Okay

423
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,036
Pretty good

424
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:26,339
I'm coming

425
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:32,837
Ready?

426
00:35:03,074 --> 00:35:03,802
Come on

427
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:09,779
Smile, don't worry

428
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:48,517
Are you ready?

429
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:08,871
Come on

430
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:15,135
Don't worry, be happy

431
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:51,872
Let's dance

432
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:15,226
Let's finish

433
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:37,640
Get up

434
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:38,780
On your feet

435
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:46,412
Yo u o kay?

436
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:58,464
Yes

437
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:01,168
You won

438
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:02,097
I lost

439
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:03,164
VVhy?

440
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:04,736
Pound for pound

441
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:07,377
He'd have beaten me in no time

442
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:09,605
See if he's all right

443
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,108
You smell turpentine?

444
00:40:14,485 --> 00:40:15,918
The boss is setting a fire

445
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,217
Fantastic

446
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:21,048
But we'll go to jail

447
00:40:21,225 --> 00:40:22,123
Prison!

448
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:24,717
This is nuts

449
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,163
Watch it

450
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:28,225
No sweat

451
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:31,026
Hey, jail sucks, boss

452
00:40:32,837 --> 00:40:37,672
You checked there's nobody inside?

453
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,035
Sure did

454
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,268
Good

455
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:43,609
Give this to dad

456
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:45,913
Tell him I love him

457
00:40:46,851 --> 00:40:48,648
Give this to C.N.

458
00:40:48,886 --> 00:40:51,821
Tell him I hate him

459
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:54,686
This is for the cops

460
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:57,525
I'm claiming all responsibility

461
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:59,762
Really?

462
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:01,023
You're going to jail, not us?

463
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:06,261
Me neither

464
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:09,470
Stand aside

465
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:13,071
C.N. and I go down together

466
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:14,871
Don't do it, boss

467
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:17,705
My eyes hurt

468
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:20,478
But so what?

469
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:22,046
I'm going to die anyway

470
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:25,819
Bye, Mary

471
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:31,118
Calm down, LW

472
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:35,220
It's all your fault

473
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:36,524
You took it too far

474
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:38,300
Dad kicked me off the Board

475
00:41:38,502 --> 00:41:40,561
I have nothing now

476
00:41:40,738 --> 00:41:41,864
I'm finished

477
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,033
What about us, boss?

478
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:46,437
Are we finished too?

479
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:47,433
You're asking me?

480
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:48,670
Yes

481
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,504
Shut up

482
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,247
Boss

483
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:56,849
O kay n ow?

484
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:57,851
Warmer still

485
00:41:59,056 --> 00:41:59,613
How's that?

486
00:41:59,924 --> 00:42:00,720
Just right

487
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:03,791
Your eyes still hurt?

488
00:42:06,264 --> 00:42:07,356
Why be so nice to me?

489
00:42:07,698 --> 00:42:08,528
You wanted to ruin me

490
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:11,327
Styrofoam's bad...

491
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:13,527
for the environment

492
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:15,968
It needs to be regulated

493
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:19,038
That motivated my acquisition

494
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:20,740
Let's be partners

495
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:23,980
In recycling paper

496
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:27,173
That's not like you

497
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:29,852
Ever since grade school

498
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:31,449
You've had to beat me

499
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:33,784
In whatever we do

500
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:36,250
You stole my girlfriends

501
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:39,695
And then dumped them

502
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:40,853
Never really loved them

503
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:42,530
I hated you so

504
00:42:43,534 --> 00:42:44,762
I hated you too

505
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:46,827
Really? What for?

506
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:48,093
For always laughing

507
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:50,367
For being born so rich

508
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:52,534
For your name

509
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,103
Low Wow is a stupid name

510
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:58,412
I hated you most

511
00:42:58,683 --> 00:43:00,878
For stealing my puppy love, Ann

512
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,417
So it boils down to Ann

513
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:10,854
But she dumped me

514
00:43:11,362 --> 00:43:13,262
She married that...

515
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:16,764
Andy Law Andy Law

516
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:19,167
That nerd

517
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:21,237
So dull

518
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,538
We fought for so many years

519
00:43:28,546 --> 00:43:30,605
But we each haven't committed

520
00:43:31,248 --> 00:43:33,011
To loving only one woman

521
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:36,215
But what about Mary?

522
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:37,445
She's nothing

523
00:43:37,888 --> 00:43:38,946
But you yelled "Bye Mary" just now

524
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,280
Weren't you engaged?

525
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,483
What happened?

526
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:46,921
I copped out

527
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,559
but she's one great dame

528
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:56,705
We were so happy together

529
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,839
Wish I could turn the clock back

530
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:10,186
But she moved overseas

531
00:44:11,555 --> 00:44:13,147
I lost track of her

532
00:44:15,893 --> 00:44:18,054
What's wrong?

533
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:21,795
See you later

534
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,701
Did I say something?

535
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:32,838
Skipper

536
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:34,609
Your Bu is back

537
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:39,245
Yes, she is. Cheers

538
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:43,212
Skipper, cheers

539
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:56,329
What's that?

540
00:44:58,169 --> 00:44:59,227
Going to college?

541
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:01,765
Considering it

542
00:45:05,009 --> 00:45:06,169
You've changed

543
00:45:07,745 --> 00:45:10,179
Love changes people

544
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:14,916
Don't rush...

545
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:17,884
to forget him

546
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,622
Or it'll get worse

547
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,684
One day

548
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:25,660
You take a shower

549
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,489
Listen to music

550
00:45:27,231 --> 00:45:29,131
And suddenly remember him

551
00:45:30,134 --> 00:45:32,898
Then you've forgotten him

552
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:39,709
You're pretty when you smile

553
00:45:43,614 --> 00:45:44,410
Bu

554
00:45:48,452 --> 00:45:49,180
Albert

555
00:45:49,353 --> 00:45:50,684
Where have you been?

556
00:45:51,255 --> 00:45:53,120
I was so worried

557
00:45:58,028 --> 00:45:59,188
You're not...

558
00:45:59,563 --> 00:46:00,962
really my type

559
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,732
I like older men

560
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:08,269
I'm older than you

561
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:11,770
I mean here

562
00:46:12,776 --> 00:46:13,708
Here?

563
00:46:14,512 --> 00:46:16,139
If I were your girl

564
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:18,278
We'd break up in 3 days, tops

565
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:23,414
You'll get it

566
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:24,583
I miss you so

567
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:26,320
I was so worried about you

568
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:29,887
This must be your mother

569
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,020
This is...

570
00:46:31,395 --> 00:46:33,522
Albert, my pal

571
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:40,261
Can you be my adopted brother?

572
00:46:40,538 --> 00:46:42,062
Good idea

573
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:43,304
I'm the adopted mother?

574
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:45,170
Wait

575
00:46:46,877 --> 00:46:48,310
Why not? Mom

576
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:49,412
Son

577
00:46:49,914 --> 00:46:50,380
Mom

578
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:53,072
My Albert

579
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:53,682
Mom

580
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:26,908
Bu! Bu!

581
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:27,910
I missed you

582
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:31,218
You miss me?

583
00:47:37,027 --> 00:47:37,959
Come back

584
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:39,557
Bu!

585
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:43,263
Bu!

586
00:48:14,865 --> 00:48:15,763
Bu!

587
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:19,028
Scram

588
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:21,830
It's you who bullied my daughter

589
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:22,768
No, I didn't

590
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:23,971
You did too

591
00:48:24,642 --> 00:48:27,668
She used to laugh all the time

592
00:48:28,045 --> 00:48:30,741
Now she hardly smiles

593
00:48:31,115 --> 00:48:34,016
My heart aches for her

594
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:37,076
What did you do to her?

595
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:39,179
Nothing

596
00:48:39,456 --> 00:48:41,185
Then why is she like this?

597
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,521
Please let me talk to her

598
00:48:43,761 --> 00:48:45,456
Just...

599
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:48,689
leave her alone

600
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:50,398
I don't speak Taiwanese

601
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:52,397
He said leave her alone

602
00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:53,501
Beat it

603
00:48:56,907 --> 00:48:57,464
Bu!

604
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:00,073
Bu!

605
00:49:00,711 --> 00:49:01,200
Get lost

606
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:01,867
Bu

607
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:02,578
Hit the road

608
00:49:20,698 --> 00:49:21,460
It's all right

609
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:33,501
You bullied my niece

610
00:49:51,495 --> 00:49:52,120
Sir

611
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,907
I'll just sit here

612
00:50:05,442 --> 00:50:06,909
Don't walk past me

613
00:50:08,078 --> 00:50:10,342
You dad's a cool dude

614
00:50:14,685 --> 00:50:17,210
Sir, you okay?

615
00:50:18,188 --> 00:50:19,086
Are you hurt?

616
00:50:19,456 --> 00:50:21,617
Leave us alone

617
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:23,824
Just 5 seconds with her, okay?

618
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:25,928
Waste of time

619
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,592
Bu, I...

620
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:28,925
Shut up

621
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:33,063
Bu!

622
00:50:33,337 --> 00:50:34,167
Shut up

623
00:50:35,572 --> 00:50:36,095
Bu!

624
00:50:36,406 --> 00:50:37,031
Shut up

625
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:38,931
Bu!

626
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:42,176
I'm warning you

627
00:50:42,846 --> 00:50:43,676
Either you kill me

628
00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:46,047
Or let me talk to her

629
00:50:50,387 --> 00:50:53,754
All right, come

630
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:57,318
Speak up

631
00:50:59,696 --> 00:51:03,598
Now or never

632
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:05,366
Don't disturb them

633
00:51:05,536 --> 00:51:06,764
I want to hear

634
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:14,809
Why bother?

635
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:20,874
You left these

636
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,448
I have plenty

637
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,760
I brought Chinese pot rice

638
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,364
It's cold, but it's your favorite

639
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:43,105
some old clothes and a pot of rice?

640
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,968
There's more

641
00:51:57,654 --> 00:51:59,087
I put a note in each one

642
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,248
Saying what?

643
00:52:02,326 --> 00:52:04,419
I love you, I miss you

644
00:52:05,028 --> 00:52:06,393
Never over 4 words

645
00:52:06,897 --> 00:52:08,228
took me hours

646
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:12,167
Too much work

647
00:52:12,703 --> 00:52:14,364
Just put $1,000 in each

648
00:52:14,738 --> 00:52:15,864
And you have me

649
00:52:28,986 --> 00:52:31,318
So do you love me?

650
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:33,284
I love you

651
00:52:35,092 --> 00:52:36,650
Since when?

652
00:52:37,628 --> 00:52:39,186
Since you stole my name—card

653
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:43,128
What wish did you make...

654
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,494
on the boat?

655
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:48,660
It's already come true

656
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:54,474
Why do you cry?

657
00:52:57,414 --> 00:52:58,381
Kiss her

658
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:01,613
Kiss her

659
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:03,786
I'll say it in Cantonese

660
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:05,510
Kiss her

661
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:15,694
You're...

662
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:17,193
Xiaojun

663
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:19,228
Do I know you?

664
00:53:20,037 --> 00:53:21,402
I'm your neighbor

665
00:53:21,872 --> 00:53:23,703
Wow, fantastic!

666
00:53:24,107 --> 00:53:24,664
VVhy?

667
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:26,798
Oh, weather is fine

668
00:53:41,591 --> 00:53:42,580
Look at them

669
00:53:57,007 --> 00:53:58,599
The women here are gorgeous

670
00:53:58,809 --> 00:53:59,241
I should have...

671
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,103
Go to hell

672
00:54:00,677 --> 00:54:03,168
I want you to meet my dolphin

673
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:04,136
Really?

674
00:54:04,414 --> 00:54:07,178
Bu! Bu!

675
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:08,179
Wow!
