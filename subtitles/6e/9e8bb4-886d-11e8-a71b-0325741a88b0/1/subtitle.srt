1
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:31,722
- Got a little present for you.
- Who is it? Sammy the Bull?

2
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:35,677
- Sammy the Knife. I diced him up.
- Did you clean him?

3
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,158
Man!

4
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,207
Come back for him this weekend.
Good luck.

5
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:09,200
Damn, Vince! Cheap, leaky bags.

6
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,447
You've looked better, Sammy.

7
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,522
Hey, baby, how are you doing?

8
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:14,844
Can I ask you a question?
Where the fuck have you been?

9
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,161
- I've been working.
- Your ass is still working.

10
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,968
I'm just doing a favour for Vince.

11
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:26,566
Melvin, you can't do this for free.
There's a mortgage and my car note.

12
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,404
Did you see all these notices?

13
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,006
Take care of your responsibilities
instead of helping your co-workers.

14
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,808
You're down at least 25 grand.

15
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,483
25 grand?

16
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:46,007
- How did that happen?
- There's the mortgage...

17
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,043
My Jag...

18
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,398
And all the other expenses.

19
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:08,965
- He's kind of cute. Who is that?
- Sammy, one of Costanzo's crew.

20
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,643
That shit turns me off.

21
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:15,563
Vince will pick him up on Saturday.

22
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:23,158
- You going out this weekend?
- Maybe. Where's your fianc?e?

23
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,002
- Are you trying to clown me?
- I'm serious. I've seen the light.

24
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,400
Check it out.
You're looking diesel, kid.

25
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,037
I work out six days a week.

26
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:39,442
You're telling me you never
jerked your dick until last week?

27
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:44,080
- That's bullshit, man.
- I ain't never needed to.

28
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:49,118
- I've been fucking since I was ten.
- I can relate to that.

29
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,961
Cisco...

30
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:54,121
Green clashes with my eyes.

31
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,919
- Move, man, we're gonna be late.
- Vinnie, you hear the news?

32
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,321
This fool gave up fucking since he
just discovered wringing his rag.

33
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:07,118
- Is that true?
- Yeah, it's lower maintenance.

34
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:15,683
Mel is like me, man.
He's got two of the sweetest...

35
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,604
If anybody needs to make a switch
to straight-jacking, it's Mel.

36
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:25,399
Them two chicken-heads are
taking my man to the cleaners.

37
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:30,723
With the loot I've saved and
the extra I'll clock this weekend, -

38
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:37,522
- I can pay off on that "Grande
Pinoche" and sail around the world.

39
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:41,238
Damn Caribbean...
Mediterranean...

40
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,879
- South Seas...
- Sounds great, bro.

41
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:51,406
You need to get on that weekend job
with me, Crunch and Grump.

42
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:54,242
I got that thing this weekend.

43
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,287
All right, gentlemen, synchronise.

44
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:29,764
- You know the drill, baby.
- Word is bond.

45
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,164
As agreed...
three blondes under 20...

46
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,480
Midwestern... No tattoos.

47
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:22,404
- How much?
- 50,000 apiece.

48
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,366
Get ready in five, four, three...

49
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,726
...two, one...

50
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:12,281
Five, four, three...

51
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,681
Go!

52
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:20,404
- I need back-up.
- We got incoming out here.

53
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,124
We'll hold them back.

54
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,519
They're backing off.

55
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,039
With this bonus hit and what I clock
this weekend, I can take a year off.

56
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,600
- This is a bonus hit?
- 25 large for clipping the big man.

57
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,158
- Non-dairy creamer?
- Yeah.

58
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:49,678
Are you ladies okay?
I'm really sorry about the mess.

59
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,524
- Time to get paid.
- Yes, sir.

60
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,039
- Take a piece of this.
- That's what we're talking about.

61
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:06,202
Yeah, man!
We fucked them up.

62
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:14,489
I want to pour milk on you and make
you part of my complete breakfast.

63
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,800
- Baby, you got a number for me?
- 911.

64
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,483
Fellas, quit wasting your time.

65
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,848
Yeah, we'd better go find Mel
before he gets my bonus.

66
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,801
- Cisco, I need back-up.
- We'll hold them back for you.

67
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:15,804
- Protect me, I'm paying you double.
- I can't spend it if I'm dead.

68
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,404
Cisco, Vince, Crunch,
we've got to get out of here.

69
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:22,766
Good work. Good work.

70
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,124
Okay, Mel...

71
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:29,567
It looks to me like you owe me
$25,000 in cash advances.

72
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:33,722
Your commission will cover that.
The good news is...

73
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,608
Here's your bonus.

74
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,479
- Mel got the bonus?
- What?

75
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:47,958
- Vince, was that guy still alive?
- Extremely alive.

76
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,677
- I'm the one who clipped him.
- I think the guy was dead.

77
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:58,798
Sure, Mel, whatever you say.
I'm wrong and you're right.

78
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:02,564
I'm lying to cheat you
out of your hard-earned bonus.

79
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:04,560
My bonus.

80
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:11,123
If you say you clipped him,
who am I to say you didn't...

81
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,881
...old friend?

82
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:31,764
You're an honest man, Mel.
Don't think I don't appreciate that.

83
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,968
I'll tell you what. To show
how much love I've got for you, -

84
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,882
- if anything were to...

85
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:42,325
...if anything happens to me, -

86
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:46,243
- you could take my boat.

87
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:50,004
- Is that love or what?
- Yeah, I guess.

88
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:53,241
You getting lonely, baby?

89
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:56,367
Daddy loves both of you.

90
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,601
- Motherfucker...
- What?

91
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:04,047
Mel... don't you want in
on this caper we planned tomorrow?

92
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:08,043
That's moonlighting, man.
Paris will kill us for that.

93
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:13,681
You're too honest for your own good.

94
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:30,726
- Wrong house again, asshole.
- Sorry.

95
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,559
- Melvin Smiley, please.
- This is he.

96
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,606
Big Top Video.

97
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:22,684
You've had our copy
of "King Kong Lives" for two weeks.

98
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:28,082
Return it immediately
or we'll have you killed.

99
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:32,360
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Fine.

100
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:37,045
- Have you seen my King Kong tape?
- No, I haven't seen it.

101
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,000
Do you think my ass
is still perky?

102
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:46,082
- As a matter of fact...
- Go ahead, give it a squeeze.

103
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:50,322
Let me know what you think.
Is it still perky?

104
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:54,164
- Is it firm yet pliable?
- Like a teenager.

105
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,844
- Is this turning you on?
- Like a light switch.

106
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:01,240
- You know what we should do?
- No, what should we do?

107
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:04,162
Invite Mom and Dad down.

108
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:08,959
Actually, they'll be here tomorrow.
We can all have dinner together.

109
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:14,362
This will be a great opportunity
for you and my parents to bond.

110
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:18,602
This will be the right time
to tell them we're engaged.

111
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,478
- You haven't told them yet?
- I've waited for the right time.

112
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:25,527
I like to break things gently.

113
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,238
It was almost a year before
you told them I wasn't Jewish.

114
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:35,281
Technically, they don't know
you're not Jewish.

115
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,838
Honey, it's gonna be fine.

116
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:40,569
I fixed things between us
just yesterday.

117
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:46,361
They'll love you.
They'll get over the goyim factor.

118
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,043
You really think they'll love me?

119
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:54,442
Remember I told you Dad's business
was in trouble with the IRS?

120
00:18:54,609 --> 00:19:00,923
He was unable to get a loan. Mom's
gambling, her plastic surgery...

121
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:06,641
You still have stomach problems?
I told you about that spicy food.

122
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,758
I took the $50,000 in our
savings account, and lent it to Dad.

123
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:18,323
With what we earn, we'll be fine
until they get back on their feet.

124
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:26,319
I can't believe this guy's
gonna give you 25 grand more.

125
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:29,686
We already got 50,000
out of this clown.

126
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:34,639
- He thinks I'm paying bills off.
- You're not paying your bills?

127
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:39,087
Hell no! Why should I?
Let his fucking fiance pay them.

128
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,602
Mel?

129
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:48,444
Are you awake?

130
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:54,038
I'm really starting to dislike you.
I didn't find my money.

131
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:03,247
You all right, babe?

132
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,003
Yeah.

133
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:19,288
- Hello, Cisco?
- What's up, kid?

134
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:24,079
That thing you got going tomorrow,
can I still get in?

135
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,518
Gump... I don't want any fuck-ups
on this kidnapping.

136
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:37,408
I ain't like that no more.

137
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,605
You know I've got my shit...

138
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:44,843
...together.
You non-word-remembering fucker.

139
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:49,207
- I don't know about no kidnapping.
- 100 large apiece.

140
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:53,203
- 100?
- Word up. Here's the deal.

141
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:56,884
There's this rich Japanese
industrialist named Jiro Nishi...

142
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,679
- From Nishi Electric?
- Richest motherfucker around.

143
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,886
How do you know he'll pay?

144
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,520
You sound just like a bitch.
"How do you know he'll pay?"

145
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:13,168
I've got his shit covered.

146
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:18,642
Nishi's got millions in cash
laying around his crib.

147
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,802
It was a legitimate question, man.

148
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:31,523
- Mr. Nishi, you're broke.
- Everything?

149
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:36,399
- How could this have happened?
- You knew the market was bearish.

150
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:39,208
It was a risky move,
making that movie.

151
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:44,079
All my life I wanted to make
a big Hollywood movie.

152
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:47,639
"Taste the Golden Spray"
was a big movie.

153
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:51,597
A huge movie. Actually,
it was the biggest movie ever made.

154
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,284
But you shouldn't have directed
and starred in it.

155
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,202
I'm not the first
to make a big movie.

156
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:03,204
Gold-leaf posters for everybody,
that was excessive.

157
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,520
I need to pick up my daughter
at college.

158
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:11,444
- And?
- I can't afford to pay the driver.

159
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:15,443
For crying out loud,
how much is it going to cost?

160
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,762
- It's a stretch limo.
- Stretch this.

161
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:24,124
Fuck ass, no!

162
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:28,282
No advances, kid. All my chips
are wrapped up in my boat.

163
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:31,839
Ask Crunch. He don't spend nothing.

164
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:35,081
Except maybe on some smut.

165
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,639
Can you hook me up with 25 G's
till we do this?

166
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:42,643
You need it for that
sell-out bitch again, don't you?

167
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,961
- Who's a bitch?
- Get the fuck out of here.

168
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:50,007
Get with the programme, Mel.

169
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:54,321
Straight-jacking saves you
that mad cream.

170
00:22:54,489 --> 00:23:01,361
- Call me later. I'll hook you up.
- Good looking out, man.

171
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:05,918
Why am I encouraging you?
Fuck both them bitches.

172
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:09,365
Dump both their asses.
Where's that limo?

173
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:13,841
I can't, man...
I just can't, okay?

174
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:18,924
How the fuck come you can't dump
these two no-respect bitches?

175
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:22,877
- The truth?
- You can't handle the truth!

176
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,609
Shut the fuck up!

177
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:31,765
I can't stand the idea
of them not liking me anymore.

178
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,046
I can't stand anybody not liking me.

179
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:37,882
There, I said it. That's the truth.

180
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,962
- Mel...
- What, man?

181
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:50,486
The 100 or so people you've murdered
in the past five years -

182
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:56,884
- more than likely have relatives
who don't think too highly of you.

183
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:06,727
- Hey, baby.
- What's up, girl?

184
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,722
You know why I called, don't you?

185
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:12,449
I don't know. Why did you call?

186
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,204
I'm getting sick of your ass.

187
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:19,361
- Always procrastinating...
- Stand up to her.

188
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:24,045
You keep lying to me...

189
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,598
Car trouble?

190
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:32,847
- Put the phone in your ear.
- Show her you're a man.

191
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:36,843
I'm sick of this shit.
Are you playing with your friends?

192
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:40,206
You're so pathetic. Bye!

193
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:44,840
Yeah, you know I love you.
We'll hook up later, sweetie.

194
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:53,239
Here you go.

195
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:59,406
- This is the girl?
- No, it's your mammy.

196
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,798
Maria's having a party tonight.
Bye, guys.

197
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,120
Are you going, too?
I'll meet you there.

198
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,326
Bye.

199
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:20,923
Lance, you're so nasty.

200
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:25,605
A much-deserved reputation.
Am I still riding with you?

201
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:29,766
- Don't push my hand away.
- Stop.

202
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,922
What's your problem?
You're an ice queen today.

203
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:37,284
- Stop.
- Hello, Miss Nishi.

204
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:40,441
Hi, who are you? Where's Aaron?

205
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:43,601
He's sick. Is this yours?

206
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:47,045
Yeah.

207
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:56,082
See you.

208
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:05,767
I think it might be better
if you ride with somebody else.

209
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:09,080
Don't worry about me.
Drive the car.

210
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:15,085
That's what you're paid for.
And don't forget my suitcase.

211
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:19,208
Careful with that.
There's a piece of crystal in there.

212
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,202
You break it,
you'll be back driving cabs.

213
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:25,805
Sorry about that, sir.

214
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:40,521
Say, bro... a little privacy.

215
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:43,761
- Yes, sir. Sorry.
- Domestics!

216
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:52,925
Lance, no.

217
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:57,799
Yeah, right. No means yes.
You know you want it.

218
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:04,242
Fucky-sucky. Me love you long time.

219
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:08,917
Stop it!

220
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,804
What's up, bro?

221
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:31,247
He'll take his hand off. If you
scream, Gilligan will shoot you.

222
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:35,448
I'll blow your... motherfucking...

223
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:38,965
I think she gets the point.

224
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:41,040
Professor...

225
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:46,683
Sorry about your boyfriend,
but he was being rude.

226
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:49,363
Do you mind?

227
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:52,885
- I guess this is a kidnapping.
- That's right.

228
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:57,520
So are you supposed to be
the "Spice Boys" or something?

229
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:07,122
Chill with that being witty shit.

230
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:10,087
Professor, put the cuffs on her.

231
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,167
Skipper, fix that mess in the car.

232
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:17,401
- You must be the millionaire.
- Pretty soon.

233
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:27,009
- Read this.
- "Father..."

234
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:34,001
- "I have been abduct. I'm fine..."
- Abducted.

235
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:38,321
- It says abduct.
- Just say abducted.

236
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:43,563
"I have been abducted. I am fine
now, but I may not be for loring."

237
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:46,846
"If you pay one million doolers..."

238
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:50,240
Wait a minute. "Loring?"
"One million doolers?"

239
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:55,085
- That's what it says.
- "Long." "A million dollars."

240
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:59,128
You know what it means.
Just say what it means, okay?

241
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:05,364
Be careful, that's Lance's crystal.
It's really fragile.

242
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:17,647
"If you don't pay a million dollars,
you'll never see me alive again."

243
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:21,279
"These men mean businesses."
Who wrote this?

244
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:25,765
- Crunch.
- What?

245
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,604
I think he's pissed about the note.

246
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:33,079
It says "businesses".
You never said I had to improvise.

247
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,959
improvise? What are you,
Meryl Streep? Okay, improvise.

248
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:42,645
These sexually frustrated,
degenerate losers mean business.

249
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:46,006
Don't improvise the note.

250
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,047
Gump, give me the fucking pen.

251
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:03,763
- Read.
- "Send one million or I'm dead."

252
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,238
Perfect.

253
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:13,366
Mel, here goes the scenario.

254
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:17,044
Since Chantel is cool,
store homegirl at your place.

255
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:21,521
- Why my place?
- Because.

256
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:27,127
Because it's the best plan.
Just do what I say, Melvin.

257
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:41,722
- What about the limo?
- You want me to drive that, too?

258
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:47,247
What's your name, kid?
Shut up. Don't fuck this up.

259
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:51,846
- Can you..?
- Drive? Yes, I can fucking drive.

260
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:03,406
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

261
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,480
Look at you.

262
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:09,927
Hi, Dad. How are you?
How was your train ride down?

263
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:13,445
Fine, it's the cab ride over
I could have lived without.

264
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:19,161
This Turkish idiot dropped us off
at that schmuck next door's house.

265
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:22,241
Then he started cursing at us.

266
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:25,685
- I need a drink.
- No!

267
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:29,644
- Ma?
- Yeah?

268
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:33,961
I'm not criticising you...

269
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:40,443
...but I think maybe
you should dress your age.

270
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:44,841
You've got Dad dressed
like a villain from "Miami Vice".

271
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:49,400
Dress my age? Morton and I
dress exactly the way we feel.

272
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:54,120
Look at your father.
He's a regular sex machine.

273
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,849
Yeah, a regular Brad Pitt.

274
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:59,728
So, where is our benefactor?

275
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:07,884
Are you okay?
All right, I'll be right back.

276
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:13,724
I went to the bank today.

277
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:17,928
Do you know what I found?
Or what I didn't find?

278
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:21,843
- I wasn't able to...
- I'm starting to dislike you.

279
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,604
- I didn't find my money!
- It's at Crunch's.

280
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:30,329
I'll pick it up tonight.

281
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,127
Now!

282
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:40,239
Money, you ready to..?

283
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,606
- Do it. Yeah.
- That's my word.

284
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:49,403
Make sure we get this right.
Crunch fucked me with that note.

285
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:53,005
My phone is plugged
into a Tracebuster.

286
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:57,481
This will keep that motherfucker...
from tracing our shit.

287
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:01,278
Not only does this
stop a trace on your call, -

288
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:04,247
- but it can also...

289
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:07,481
- Trace?
- Trace who's tracing you.

290
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:10,243
What if they've got a Tracebuster?

291
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:13,765
That's why I got this
Tracebuster Buster.

292
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:19,447
When they try to bust your trace,
this will bust the Tracebuster -

293
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:22,487
- that's busting your...

294
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:25,402
- Trace.
- That's my word.

295
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:29,847
- We'll use my cell phone.
- Just patch that shit into here.

296
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:33,001
Plug and play, motherfucker.

297
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:07,441
Hello.

298
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:12,603
Mr. Nishi, you don't know me, but
I have something for you to hear.

299
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:17,365
- It says businesses...
- Hold on a second, that's not it.

300
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:22,801
These sexually frustrated...

301
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:26,041
Hold on, all right? Just relax.

302
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:32,561
- Listen to this.
- Toothpolish, haemorrhoid cream...

303
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:38,878
Hello? Hello?

304
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:42,564
That motherfucker had the nerve
to hop smart on my ass.

305
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:02,162
What?

306
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:07,847
- Send one million or I'm dead.
- Who is this?

307
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:12,321
We have your daughter.
One million dollars or she dies.

308
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:14,798
Is she okay?

309
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:17,961
If we don't get that money,
she won't be.

310
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:22,122
I don't have money.
I go bankrupt.

311
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:27,238
Don't fuck with us or we'll send
your daughter back in little pieces.

312
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:32,244
You've got till noon tomorrow or
your daughter is a slab of meat.

313
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:34,639
- Understand?
- I understand.

314
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:37,687
I'll call tomorrow and say where.

315
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:41,524
If I even smell a cop,
I'll cut off her hand.

316
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:44,567
Don't try to trace this call.

317
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:48,049
Now that's how you do shit.

318
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:51,599
I've got this shit under control.

319
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:55,603
I not call police.
Fuck all the police!

320
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,806
- Was I a bad motherfucker?
- You were a bad...

321
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:01,085
Motherfucker.

322
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:04,400
- Bad motherfucker.
- Nasty.

323
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,685
I trace you, buster.

324
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:16,883
Up you go.

325
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:21,044
Hello?

326
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:27,728
How are you, old friend?
What? My goddaughter?

327
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:32,485
The set-up call is at 10 tomorrow?

328
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,880
Calm down. Don't worry.

329
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:40,042
Bastard!
That son of a bitch will die.

330
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:43,758
That's it! 10 a.m. tomorrow
we set up the drop, -

331
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:47,285
- and by noon we get paid.

332
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:53,126
We're gonna get paid!
In the house.

333
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:56,167
Get your ass to my office
in 20 minutes.

334
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:01,084
Motherfucker!

335
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:05,083
Paris called me for some emergency.
Don't do jack till I get back.

336
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:10,323
- I could set up the...
- Don't do shit till I get back.

337
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:20,517
I'm really sorry, Melvin.
It's nice to finally meet you...

338
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:24,398
You seem like a nice enough
German-Irish fella.

339
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:29,723
But I have to say...
are you both out of your minds?

340
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,323
We know what we're doing.

341
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:35,322
You're going to kill your father.

342
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:38,765
Marriage?
A Catholic and a Jew!

343
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:42,808
You'll put your father
in an early grave.

344
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,644
- What about your parents?
- They're both dead.

345
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,358
- You see?
- They were dead before we met.

346
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:54,681
- Please!
- This isn't about Daddy.

347
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:59,081
Or Mei's parents.
It's about you. You're prejudiced.

348
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:01,558
I'm prejudiced?

349
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:05,039
There's not one prejudiced bone
in my body.

350
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:08,884
If I want to marry goyim,
I'll marry goyim.

351
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:12,405
- Over my dead body.
- If I want, I'll marry a black man.

352
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:16,847
- Shut your mouth.
- A six-foot-nine shvartzer.

353
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:23,159
I apologise. I didn't mean to cause
such a schlimazel here.

354
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:29,643
- We'll go to the temple tomorrow.
- You think that might work?

355
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,164
- Mr. Shulman?
- Mort.

356
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:35,924
Mort, I know how your wife
feels about me and Pam.

357
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:40,924
I want you to know, I would never
marry her without your blessing.

358
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,239
Melvin...

359
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:47,766
Could you get me a shot
of that rum I saw in there.

360
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:05,044
No!

361
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,920
- Never give Daddy a drink.
- Why?

362
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:18,728
- It's horrible.
- It's not so bad.

363
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,325
It's not so bad?
He's a meshuggener.

364
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:52,244
- Hey boss, what's going on?
- Sit down and shut up.

365
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:04,408
Even for those who
live outside the law -

366
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,357
- it is understood that there
are certain guidelines -

367
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:12,363
- which must be observed.
Otherwise you have anarchy.

368
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:15,327
I hear you, boss.

369
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:21,281
We run a serious business here.
We make money.

370
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:25,362
This business is based on
trust, loyalty and honour.

371
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:29,602
In the House of Paris
that's all we've got.

372
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:32,920
That's it, baby.
It's all about love.

373
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:41,445
When the rules are broken,
the Paris machine breaks down.

374
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:48,287
Discipline must be enforced.
Order must be restored.

375
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:52,362
In my house,
there has been a transgression.

376
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:57,444
An unauthorised kidnapping
in my house.

377
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:00,919
- Who could be that stupid?
- It gets worse.

378
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:06,288
In this particular case
the transgression is personal.

379
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:11,762
In this case
the kidnappee is my goddaughter.

380
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:14,483
- Fuck!
- Some rock...

381
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:18,528
Some dolt...
Some less than senseless thing -

382
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:22,841
- has decided to come to my house
and kidnap my goddaughter.

383
00:41:23,009 --> 00:41:25,603
And I'm looking...

384
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:30,559
I'm searching for the motherfucker
stupid enough to fuck with me.

385
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:35,643
What's this got to do with me?

386
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:39,119
What would you do
to that son of a jackal?

387
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,600
Me?

388
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:46,158
I would...

389
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:49,719
What would you do to someone -

390
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:54,280
- who decided to fuck with you
in your own house?

391
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:58,958
- I'd bust some caps.
- Bust some caps!

392
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:02,439
Give this man a gold star.

393
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:05,726
It is you...

394
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:16,839
It is you I am putting in charge
of this whole operation.

395
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:24,882
It is you who must go forth and
bring these motherfuckers to me.

396
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:42,323
Let's just take the money and go to
L.A., where people like us belong.

397
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:09,437
Get that, Mel.
I'm not dressed.

398
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:15,404
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I came to drop your shit off.

399
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:21,007
Goodbye, you punk-ass bitch.
I'm leaving town.

400
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:27,525
I'm getting a glass of prune juice.

401
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:32,524
- Hurry up, it's a long way.
- Don't worry, I know a shortcut.

402
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:02,965
- Don't do that.
- What's in there?

403
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:05,120
Deer meat.

404
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:08,440
Cisco went hunting.
He gave me the meat.

405
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:11,999
- He's a vegetarian.
- There's a dead deer in there?

406
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:17,368
That's gross.
Take it out to the garbage, please.

407
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,600
Ma, pour me some coffee.

408
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:38,329
You don't want to go in there.

409
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:43,358
- It smells really bad.
- Melvin, that's disgusting.

410
00:44:45,729 --> 00:44:48,641
Morton, look at that dog.

411
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:57,443
Hey! Let go!
You giant rat!

412
00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:01,807
There's something so peculiar
about that boy.

413
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:15,448
- Hello?
- Hi, Big Top Video.

414
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:26,278
I'm hearing things.

415
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:34,444
- I am not going to temple.
- Hello.

416
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:38,079
Hello. You're avoiding us, sir.

417
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:42,765
- Sorry, I apologise.
- She has become godless.

418
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:46,638
"Why are you crying, little girl?"
"I want 'King Kong Lives'!

419
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:49,277
Who are you talking to?

420
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:53,124
You can't rent that.
Melvin Smiley has it out right now.

421
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:56,759
- And he's busy.
- I promise I'll bring it back.

422
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:02,968
- Aren't you going to temple?
- No.

423
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:06,166
You'll ruin my surprise.

424
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:09,366
I don't like surprises.
What surprise?

425
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:12,726
I was going to cook a kosher meal.

426
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:17,805
- This I got to see.
- Excuse me.

427
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:21,564
Let go of that.

428
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:26,439
Let go.
Get out of here.

429
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:30,727
You are a pathetic little man.

430
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:33,528
Pam!

431
00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:01,368
Daddy had to make a pit stop
and I forgot my purse.

432
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:05,522
- Do you have to make a pit stop?
- No, I'm fine.

433
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,408
- It's a long drive.
- I'm fine.

434
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:11,129
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

435
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:15,043
Oh, I forgot
a thing in the trunk there.

436
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:19,680
If you've got a thing in the trunk,
you'd better get it out.

437
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:24,404
- What's that?
- His thing. Come on, we're late.

438
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:29,040
If that's a dead deer,
get it out of here... I swear.

439
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:36,962
I can do this.

440
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:42,478
Cisco, where the fuck are you?

441
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:56,447
Don't call.
Don't you call, you stupid fuck.

442
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,806
They got Tracebuster Buster.

443
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:03,803
I got Tracebuster Buster Buster.

444
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:09,922
All right, think... Crunch!

445
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:13,968
Be cool, playboy.
I got you covered.

446
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:19,123
I'll pick the chick up
and keep her here at my crib.

447
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:23,202
- What time?
- Give me about an hour and a half.

448
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,678
Thanks, bro.

449
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:34,925
You ready again? Come on.

450
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:44,325
Are you okay?

451
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:49,404
If I take your gag off,
you've got to promise not to scream.

452
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:56,327
I don't suppose
you could take these cuffs off, too?

453
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:01,517
I didn't think so.
Listen, I have to pee.

454
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:09,847
- Hey! I need a little help.
- Oh, sorry.

455
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:15,003
I need help with my underwear,
unless you take my cuffs off.

456
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:18,161
Sorry.

457
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:40,398
I'm done.

458
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:48,317
You don't seem like a kidnapper.

459
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:51,959
- I'm usually not.
- Aren't you going to flush?

460
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:54,802
Technically, I'm a hit man.

461
00:49:54,969 --> 00:50:00,202
- A hit man? Does that pay well?
- Of course, I make a killing.

462
00:50:01,689 --> 00:50:04,249
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

463
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:08,197
- I'm hungry. You must be starved.
- Yeah, I could eat...

464
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:11,600
- A horse?
- I could never eat a horse.

465
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:14,806
Whatever you want,
I'll cook it for you.

466
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:18,279
- You'll put a hit on it for me?
- Yeah.

467
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:22,044
- How about a pterodactyl?
- You're in luck.

468
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:25,519
I just whacked a rare
cheese and pepperoni pterodactyl.

469
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,806
- Cold or nuked?
- Nuke it.

470
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:31,802
Which girl is your girlfriend?

471
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:35,803
Chantel, I guess so.
But I'm engaged to Pam.

472
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:39,325
Chantel is your girlfriend,
but you're engaged to Pam?

473
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:42,481
Sounds complicated.
You want to tell me more?

474
00:50:42,649 --> 00:50:46,437
Cisco, I can do this.
I ain't no fuck-up.

475
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:54,641
I'll prove to you motherfuckers
that I can handle my...

476
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:56,720
...business.

477
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,801
Yeah, I can handle my business.

478
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:47,288
- Hello.
- Noon today. One million dollars.

479
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:51,362
Cash.
Place it in the green garbage can -

480
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:55,522
- near the Abbey Shelter on McBryde
Trail off of Old School Road.

481
00:51:55,689 --> 00:51:57,088
Understand?

482
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:05,481
- I don't understand MacBlyde.
- What?

483
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:10,404
- No, hang up.
- What is MacBlyde?

484
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:12,844
McBryde Trail...

485
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,085
Goddamn..!

486
00:52:17,249 --> 00:52:19,399
What is MacBlyde?

487
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,163
It's a motherfucking...

488
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:24,524
Goddamn...

489
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:27,442
It's a thing.

490
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:41,408
I understand. McBryde Trail.

491
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:45,727
I will drop money.

492
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:48,961
Good.

493
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,564
Get him. Get him!

494
00:52:56,729 --> 00:52:58,321
Let's go.

495
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:02,607
Bust a move.
Come on, motherfucker, now.

496
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:11,639
You have responsibilities in life.

497
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:16,678
It seems like no matter what I do,
it's never good enough.

498
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:19,443
It's starting to make me miserable.

499
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:23,761
You make it easy for Chantel and Pam
to take advantage of you.

500
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:29,720
I'm not blaming them.
At least, I'm not trying to.

501
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:33,677
All I want them to do is be happy.

502
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:40,561
I just can't stand the idea
of them not liking me anymore.

503
00:53:40,729 --> 00:53:44,881
To be honest,
I can't stand anybody not liking me.

504
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:49,042
- That sounds pretty dysfunctional.
- Why do you say that?

505
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:52,406
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

506
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:57,279
...you might suffer
from a personality disorder.

507
00:53:57,449 --> 00:54:00,839
- What?
- You're whipped.

508
00:54:01,009 --> 00:54:03,239
You're a nice guy.

509
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:09,678
- Just do what's right for you.
- You're really smart.

510
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:27,437
What the fuck is that?

511
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:41,922
- Hey!
- You filthy kidnapping scum!

512
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:45,525
- Where's the girl?
- She's at...

513
00:54:45,689 --> 00:54:47,600
Don't get cute.

514
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:53,526
It's Mr. Paris' goddaughter
you've kidnapped.

515
00:54:53,689 --> 00:54:57,602
If you want to stay breathing,
you'd better tell me...

516
00:54:57,769 --> 00:55:01,682
Melvin... where the fuck she is
and who the fuck... Melvin...

517
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:06,604
...is the insidious mastermind
behind this plot... Melvin.

518
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:09,124
Melvin?

519
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:12,725
Melvin? Melvin Smiley?

520
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:18,969
Melvin Smiley
is the mastermind behind this?

521
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:24,362
My God! What a world!

522
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,966
I mean, the humanity...
the betrayal...

523
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:35,318
He was like a brother to me, man.
Oh, well...

524
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,006
Somebody's got to die.

525
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:59,289
You're always dying
to do something for me...

526
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:02,521
Now's your chance.

527
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:22,524
No more Mr. Nice Guy.
We're gonna find Melvin Smiley.

528
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:25,522
And we're gonna kill him.

529
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:31,043
I knew Melvin had money problems,
but I didn't think he'd go this far.

530
00:56:31,209 --> 00:56:34,281
Find the girl first, then deal him.

531
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:37,919
Jiro-san, we're going for a ride.

532
00:56:38,089 --> 00:56:41,968
Who knows what unspeakable things
they do to my little girl.

533
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:46,481
It says here you're supposed to soak
the matzo for five minutes.

534
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:52,485
- Is this traditional Jewish food?
- It's the only Jewish food I have.

535
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:56,528
You need margarine
to saut? the mushrooms.

536
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:59,840
- Is that kosher?
- Like I would know.

537
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:03,445
Stir it around so it doesn't stick.

538
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:07,602
I could help you better
if I didn't have these cuffs on.

539
00:57:18,889 --> 00:57:23,440
You're pretty good at this.
You ever cook for your dad?

540
00:57:23,609 --> 00:57:29,206
My father only uses me
to impress his associates.

541
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:33,999
- Do you have any brown sugar?
- Yeah.

542
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:39,321
Do you know what it's like living
your life to please other people?

543
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:42,959
Actually, I guess you do.
It's a drag.

544
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:46,280
I wish I could just get away.
You know what I mean?

545
00:57:46,449 --> 00:57:52,445
I do, as a matter of fact.
I've always dreamt of getting away.

546
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:57,881
Come here, you're missing
the whole joy of cooking.

547
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:03,442
You have to use your hands.
Get in and get messy.

548
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,884
I kind of like it.

549
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:15,885
Now we glaze our LM-4 leghorn.

550
00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:18,961
- Our what?
- Common broiler chicken.

551
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:23,725
I'm studying them
in advanced biotechnology.

552
00:59:14,649 --> 00:59:19,404
Damn! Sorry about that.
I'll clean that up for you.

553
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:51,478
Did you know that the white leghorn
was successfully bred into hybrids?

554
00:59:51,649 --> 00:59:54,163
Doesn't everybody?

555
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:59,323
All 33 phenotypes reach
sexual maturity within two months.

556
00:59:59,489 --> 01:00:03,038
- And then we eat them.
- Yep.

557
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:07,441
It's kind of sad
that in order to feed us, -

558
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:12,285
- something so young,
in the prime of its life, -

559
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:14,679
- has to die.

560
01:00:16,689 --> 01:00:20,477
- Help.
- Keiko.

561
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:30,045
I'm sorry.

562
01:00:34,729 --> 01:00:37,197
Shit.

563
01:01:04,249 --> 01:01:07,241
- Here you go, Ma.
- You feel better?

564
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:11,448
Getting your hair done
always helps to mend a broken heart.

565
01:01:11,609 --> 01:01:16,524
You're doing the right thing, baby.
We have to preserve our heritage.

566
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:21,001
Tell him after we eat. Better he has
a broken heart on a full stomach.

567
01:01:21,169 --> 01:01:24,047
You think he'll take the money back?

568
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:41,048
- Hey Mel, what are you doing?
- Nothing. How was your outing?

569
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:46,158
- Smells good. Something's cooking.
- We're ready to eat when you are.

570
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:52,082
- This is Crunch.
- What's up? Hold on a second.

571
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:55,480
Can you guys excuse me a second?

572
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:58,243
Crunch, what the fuck's going on?

573
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:01,879
Left.

574
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:05,678
Right here. This is the place.

575
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:10,479
I'm getting out of the country,
and you need to do the same. Now!

576
01:02:10,649 --> 01:02:13,686
I went by the office today.

577
01:02:13,849 --> 01:02:17,125
Paris is planning a big hit.

578
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:20,361
I said lanolin, -

579
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:23,885
- not some aloe vera bullshit.

580
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:26,802
Get it straight.

581
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:31,326
Seems like some motherfuckers
kidnapped Paris' goddaughter.

582
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:35,402
Some Japanese bitch.
You see what I'm saying?

583
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:39,118
You've got to let him have it.
Point blank.

584
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,849
It's over. Kaput. That's it.

585
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:44,728
But Ma, it just seems very harsh.

586
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,842
Cisco's trying to save himself
and he's after all of us.

587
01:02:54,009 --> 01:02:57,638
He got Gump. My advice...

588
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:00,846
Get the fuck out of Dodge now.

589
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:03,728
They're coming for your ass now.

590
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:06,528
- Peace, out.
- Shit!

591
01:03:22,129 --> 01:03:24,199
Here's your prune juice.

592
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:27,361
- Leave the bottle.
- Who's that?

593
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:34,678
Hello. Is Melvin Smiley here?

594
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:38,637
- We're Melvin's co-workers.
- Really?

595
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:42,848
- Is that chicken I smell?
- Have you all eaten?

596
01:03:43,009 --> 01:03:47,002
- I haven't eaten all day.
- Come on in.

597
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:49,364
How gracious!

598
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:54,160
He's a devoted colleague.
A man who works to better society.

599
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:56,968
Why does he work on weekends?

600
01:03:57,129 --> 01:04:01,327
- He works with the homeless.
- And sells them computers?

601
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:05,448
You'd be surprised how many
homeless people buy computers.

602
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:08,123
Really?

603
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:11,281
- Hello, Melvin.
- Hi, Melvin.

604
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:14,407
You want to talk about this outside?

605
01:04:14,569 --> 01:04:18,847
Sit down, Melvin.
I'd like to propose a toast.

606
01:04:19,009 --> 01:04:21,682
To my wife.
A lovely woman, -

607
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:27,128
- who for the past eight years
has cost me more than $200,000 -

608
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:31,840
- in plastic surgery bills.
And what was the end result?

609
01:04:32,009 --> 01:04:35,081
A 57-year-old woman -

610
01:04:35,249 --> 01:04:38,321
- with the face
of a 25-year-old ape.

611
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:40,923
- Morton!
- Shut your pisk.

612
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:46,959
Many men have found me
to be a ravishing creature.

613
01:04:47,129 --> 01:04:50,644
Don't you think I'm still
a ravishing creature?

614
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:53,198
- Yes, certainly.
- Sure.

615
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:55,439
- Sure.
- I agree.

616
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:59,158
- You're a creature.
- Sit down. You're drunk.

617
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:02,002
To my darling daughter, Pamela.

618
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:05,286
A princess... My only child.

619
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:10,239
And a source of pride
to degenerate, manipulative, -

620
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:13,207
- gold-digging leeches everywhere.

621
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:17,203
Which leads me
to my would-be son-in-law Melvin, -

622
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:20,725
- who's very charming
in a "Rain Man" kind of way, -

623
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:24,677
- but obviously not good enough
for some parties.

624
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:28,637
- Daddy, I think...
- Sit down and shut your pisk.

625
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:31,323
- Sit down!
- Where was I?

626
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:34,879
Right after we meet him
we have a big fight.

627
01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:39,486
Then he comes on like Sidney Poitier
in "Guess who's Coming to Dinner".

628
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:42,527
A fine film, I might add.
And he proclaims:

629
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:46,443
"I will not marry your daughter
unless I have your blessing."

630
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:51,000
To which I say:
"She doesn't deserve you."

631
01:05:51,169 --> 01:05:55,208
"You deserve a life
of tolerance and brotherhood."

632
01:05:55,369 --> 01:06:01,399
When I see four men, of different
races, colours and creeds -

633
01:06:01,569 --> 01:06:06,962
- sitting together at a table
it fills me with hope.

634
01:06:13,089 --> 01:06:16,206
No, let go!

635
01:06:17,089 --> 01:06:20,081
Gross, you nasty mother...

636
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:32,563
Bonus time!
And guess who's the bonus.

637
01:06:35,049 --> 01:06:37,517
You pissed at me, baby?

638
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:43,605
Backstabbing motherfucker!
We're supposed to be friends.

639
01:06:46,489 --> 01:06:51,483
I just need a little space now.
I still love you.

640
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:55,768
Just like you loved Gump?

641
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:59,558
Every man for himself, Mel.

642
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:14,478
- Pam.
- Yeah?

643
01:07:14,649 --> 01:07:18,437
- Were you gonna break up with me?
- Yeah.

644
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:25,046
I guess this is goodbye then.

645
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:30,329
- I'm sorry about the meal and all.
- Things could be worse.

646
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:57,525
He's fucking getting away.

647
01:07:58,609 --> 01:08:00,565
Come on, move.

648
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:13,167
"Don't worry, baby,
this will save us hours."

649
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:17,242
Were right back where we started,
you fucking idiot.

650
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:20,958
He's an animal.
I should have found the money.

651
01:08:21,129 --> 01:08:24,644
He won't hurt her now.
She's the only insurance he's got.

652
01:09:09,009 --> 01:09:10,920
Shit!

653
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:44,442
- That was intense.
- I'll be right back.

654
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:48,727
My leg!
I think I broke my leg.

655
01:10:16,089 --> 01:10:20,207
Nice driving, Mario.
Now get us out of here.

656
01:10:20,369 --> 01:10:24,885
You have a Triple-A card?
Mine expired.

657
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:31,678
My God! He's got a gun.

658
01:10:34,409 --> 01:10:37,367
- Were you gonna keep this?
- He wanted it.

659
01:10:38,809 --> 01:10:42,643
You should be ashamed of yourself.

660
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:51,000
Melvin! Melvin, I'm sorry.
Can we talk about this?

661
01:10:51,169 --> 01:10:54,002
Melvin, I love you!

662
01:10:55,089 --> 01:10:57,319
Shit!

663
01:11:08,929 --> 01:11:10,999
I wanted it...

664
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:14,718
If you would've stayed your ass
on the freeway -

665
01:11:14,889 --> 01:11:17,722
- this wouldn't have happened.

666
01:11:24,289 --> 01:11:28,328
Would you happen to know
where Melvin is headed?

667
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:39,600
Would you happen to know
where Melvin is headed?

668
01:11:39,769 --> 01:11:43,079
Would you?

669
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:46,480
- What happens now?
- I take you home.

670
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:50,688
I mean with us.
What happens with us?

671
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:02,046
There's something
you need to understand.

672
01:12:02,209 --> 01:12:05,519
I murder people for money.

673
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:10,046
So far they've been bad people...
plus a few obnoxious ones.

674
01:12:10,209 --> 01:12:14,248
- That's the only thing I'm good at.
- I'm cool with that.

675
01:12:14,409 --> 01:12:19,039
- Your life will be in danger.
- A constant adrenaline rush.

676
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:22,326
- I like it.
- Understand this...

677
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:26,801
I absolutely cannot be the only one
falling in love here.

678
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:30,848
- It's got to be mutual.
- I'm feeling you, Skipper.

679
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:36,680
I'm gonna return this tape.
When I come back...

680
01:12:36,849 --> 01:12:41,525
...if you really want to,
we'll disappear together.

681
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:17,964
- Skipper.
- Just stay still.

682
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:23,759
I'm going to get us out of here.
Calm down, please.

683
01:13:30,089 --> 01:13:31,841
Shit!

684
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:35,445
Are you okay?

685
01:13:35,609 --> 01:13:38,885
We can get out the back.

686
01:13:44,889 --> 01:13:49,679
Come on.
It's safe... just don't look down.

687
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:58,078
- Skipper, look.
- You've got to get out of here.

688
01:13:58,249 --> 01:14:00,888
Meet me by the video store.
I've got to deal with this guy.

689
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:36,363
The most expensive stand-up
in motion picture marketing.

690
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:38,724
Awesome.

691
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:54,045
Smiley...

692
01:16:55,729 --> 01:16:59,005
Here's your fucking tape back.

693
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:02,798
Let's see here...

694
01:17:04,009 --> 01:17:07,479
Late charges.

695
01:17:07,649 --> 01:17:11,767
Mama, what's this?
The tape's not rewound.

696
01:17:11,929 --> 01:17:16,241
- That's going to cost you.
- I've taken a lot of shit from you.

697
01:17:16,409 --> 01:17:21,358
High prices, a lousy selection,
and your rude phone calls.

698
01:17:21,529 --> 01:17:23,963
I'll tell you one thing:

699
01:17:24,129 --> 01:17:27,644
I will never come in here again,
you snotty little...

700
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:31,568
I'm gonna finish what I started.

701
01:17:38,209 --> 01:17:40,006
No!

702
01:17:41,169 --> 01:17:45,367
- Knuckle up, bitch.
- Let's go, motherfucker.

703
01:17:57,569 --> 01:18:00,959
- Where's the girl?
- I let her go.

704
01:18:04,489 --> 01:18:09,279
You let that bitch go?
I can't believe how stupid you are.

705
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:13,522
- She ain't no bitch.
- You like this girl. Shit, man!

706
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:18,717
She tricked you, fool!
Just another manipulating bitch.

707
01:18:19,809 --> 01:18:21,845
That's not true.

708
01:18:22,009 --> 01:18:26,844
Haven't I taught you nothing? She
don't like you. I don't like you.

709
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:51,928
You were nothing. I got you a job.
I taught you everything you know.

710
01:18:52,089 --> 01:18:55,923
Remember what I said about my boat?
I lied. You ain't getting shit.

711
01:18:56,089 --> 01:18:59,286
You know what? I don't give a fuck.

712
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:47,929
Son of a bitch.

713
01:19:50,809 --> 01:19:53,960
Ain't that a bitch.

714
01:19:56,769 --> 01:20:01,206
All I wanted to do
was to sail my boat, man.

715
01:20:01,369 --> 01:20:03,564
You know...

716
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:06,641
Navigate by the stars.

717
01:20:06,809 --> 01:20:09,881
See dolphins racing alongside.

718
01:20:10,049 --> 01:20:14,725
Maybe even kill a few of them.

719
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:19,402
Mel... I can almost see it.

720
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:22,322
It's fucking beautiful.

721
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:30,484
- Mel?
- I'm here, buddy.

722
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:36,724
- I can't see it no more, man.
- I can see it. You're there, man.

723
01:20:36,889 --> 01:20:39,722
You're right there on the deck.

724
01:20:39,889 --> 01:20:42,608
It's just you and the sea.

725
01:20:43,809 --> 01:20:47,438
You're free now.

726
01:22:23,649 --> 01:22:26,800
My little buttercup.

727
01:22:48,889 --> 01:22:53,360
Cool. They're going to make a movie
about your kidnapping.

728
01:22:53,529 --> 01:22:57,488
My dad's in L.A. right now
finalising the deal.

729
01:22:57,649 --> 01:23:02,848
Your dad was totally broke, now he
gets to make a big Hollywood movie.

730
01:23:03,009 --> 01:23:08,845
- Your dad must be so happy.
- Everything's back to normal. Bye.

731
01:23:18,529 --> 01:23:22,966
Straight home, ma'am? Or would
you like to get away from it all?

732
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:47,848
- I don't understand.
- Vince, let's go.

733
01:23:48,009 --> 01:23:51,763
You know your dad's movie display?
It really was well made.

734
01:24:06,769 --> 01:24:09,044
- So..?
- Yeah?

735
01:24:09,209 --> 01:24:12,963
- Are we gonna disappear?
- You're the man.
