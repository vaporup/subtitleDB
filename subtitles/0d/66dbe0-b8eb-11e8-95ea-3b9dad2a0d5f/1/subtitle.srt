1
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,679
BETTY BLUE

2
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,111
<i>I had known Betty for a week.</i>

3
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:07,980
<i>We made love every night.</i>

4
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:11,216
<i>The forecast was for storms.</i>

5
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,967
Saved!

6
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,691
Now for a nice little shower!

7
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,156
First time we've met in daylight.

8
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:01,960
You're much too early!

9
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:07,165
So what? How do I look?

10
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:13,238
What do you think?

11
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,608
Do I please you?

12
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,354
Eating all that chilli by yourself?

13
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,357
In this heat? You're mad.

14
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:36,261
I'll eat chilli no matter how hot it is, Betty.

15
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,401
Me too, I'm starving!

16
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,070
Glad to see me?

17
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:51,510
They're all bastards!

18
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:54,413
Who?

19
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:57,683
Forget it, Kiss me!

20
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:04,323
All bastards!

21
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,893
No wonder a girl ends up splitting!

22
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,062
Wait, explain, I don't get you.

23
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:13,098
Why don't you ever listen to me?

24
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,133
I do listen! I'm listening!

25
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,074
I expect more from a guy than sex!

26
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:30,949
To think I spent a year in that dump

27
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:35,253
wiping tables and dodging drunks

28
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,391
just to get felt up one morning by the boss!

29
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,326
I've got to start all over again now!

30
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:44,363
I split. Anyway, I was fired.

31
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,499
Can't even buy a train ticket.

32
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:13,959
<i>She was a flower with psychic antennae and a tinsel heart.</i>

33
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:19,231
<i>Not many girls could dress as casually as she did.</i>

34
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:41,319
I can't get up! We drank too much.

35
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,260
I need to take a piss.

36
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,400
Don't press on my bladder.

37
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,244
I'm happy being with you.

38
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,983
I'd like to stay with you if I can.

39
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:17,189
Well, I think you can.

40
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,360
I've got no wife, no kids.

41
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:26,631
We've got a nice pad.

42
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:31,236
I have an OK job. I do repairs.

43
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:37,108
I'm confident...
We're still young.

44
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,116
<i>I didn't want explanations.</i>

45
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,321
<i>I only wanted to kiss her</i>
<i>and caress her ass</i>

46
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:51,490
<i>as long as her bladder held out.</i>

47
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,021
Who is that guy? Wake up!

48
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:26,625
Who is he?
Make yourself at home!

49
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:28,927
Wait, I'll be right back.

50
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:32,163
How are you? Excuse me,
you're sitting on my trousers.

51
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:40,272
I don't wear underwear either.
It's uncomfortable.

52
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,240
I'll get you some coffee.

53
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:44,643
I have to make it first.

54
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:46,978
I'll do it, You get dressed.

55
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,983
Is it because of that girl

56
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:55,053
that you're still in
the sack at 10 a.m.?

57
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,688
10 o'clock already?

58
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:00,125
You're fantastic. It's 11!

59
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:05,130
Always moisten the grounds first.

60
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:10,201
All I have to do is to run an ad

61
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:15,407
to get loads of guys for your job,
but I want to be fair.

62
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,310
I've had you a long time
and you're OK.

63
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,150
But I don't think you can
keep that girl here

64
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,285
and do your job right

65
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,220
Know what I mean?

66
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:32,557
See how it swells up?

67
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,127
George told you about her?

68
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:37,963
You let everyone see!

69
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:41,666
He could've told you
how much she does here.

70
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:46,538
The housework, shopping,
everything! That counts a lot!

71
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:51,710
Saves me lots of time!
What's more,

72
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:54,312
she does it for free.

73
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,985
So you want me
to just forget it,

74
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:03,655
I did oversleep today,
but I'll make up for it!

75
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,691
Especially after coffee!

76
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:10,695
Tell me when.

77
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:19,437
Slap some paint
on all these shacks!

78
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:22,374
They look like hell!

79
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,643
They sure would look better.

80
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,084
There may be a way...

81
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,522
Can you and your girl do it?

82
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:40,091
That'd take
a whole crew of painters!

83
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,594
We'd still be at it
in the year 2000!

84
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:47,699
When you're in love, what's time?
And don't you two form a crew?

85
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:52,203
<i>OK, but how will you pay her?</i>

86
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:58,610
You're crazy! You just asked me
to forget I saw her!

87
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,948
How can I make ends meet
if I pay her?

88
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,988
Just do it at your own pace!

89
00:12:12,425 --> 00:12:16,628
Get to work! I'll order
the paint from old George.

90
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:21,032
Don't worry, just plug away!

91
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,269
And don't forget
to moisten the grounds!

92
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:38,016
Who was that fat slob?

93
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:40,185
The owner.

94
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,053
What did he want?

95
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,291
Nothing, he just wants us
to do a little paint job.

96
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,194
Terrific! I love to paint!

97
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:55,366
<i>500 bungalows. 500 fronts.</i>

98
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:59,037
<i>1500 sides.</i>
<i>Thousands of shutters!</i>

99
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,240
<i>Just a little paint job!</i>

100
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:06,678
Are you two going to repaint
all these shacks?

101
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:09,247
Should repaint the people too!

102
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,283
Now shut your big mouth,
George!

103
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,121
Hell, are you mad at me?

104
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:17,355
How did you guess?

105
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:22,060
Don't talk about it in front of Betty! Go play your sax!

106
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:33,938
I just told those nice folks
we'd paint their house.

107
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:41,513
What shall I paint?

108
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:43,948
The shutters.
And I'll do the rest.

109
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,684
- What's bugging you?
- Nothing.

110
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:48,720
The winner helps the other.

111
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:04,402
Ready!

112
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,639
I hope she doesn't fall!

113
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:10,241
She won't. She's young!

114
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:33,665
I win!

115
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:37,569
I'll help you now!

116
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,103
OK, go ahead!

117
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:57,689
What a drag!

118
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:05,630
Shit, you goofed!

119
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:07,365
What's wrong?

120
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:12,237
My fault. I forgot to tell you
not to go past the corner!

121
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,205
The brush is too big.

122
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,108
Now it looks as if
that side is started!

123
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,077
But who cares?

124
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:20,245
"Who cares?"

125
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:23,381
You're not going to paint
just one side, are you?

126
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,085
You want to do
the whole shack for them!

127
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:32,156
You really are
a champion house painter!

128
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:33,558
What do you expect?

129
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:38,930
Go on, I'll hold the bucket.

130
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:22,240
Ready?

131
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:30,915
Smile! Hold the roller higher!

132
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,131
It's terrific!

133
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,534
- I look awful!
- What are you mad about?

134
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,972
We're fed up with painting.
Just one more!

135
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,441
Stop, we've already got 50, Betty.

136
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,013
Let's have a beer.

137
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:03,414
That fat slob again!

138
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:06,451
You sure are working hard!

139
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,486
What do you expect?

140
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:14,225
You're fantastic! We'll see
if you can keep up the pace!

141
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,261
What did he just say?

142
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,430
He didn't say anything!

143
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,366
What do you mean, "the pace"?

144
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:26,371
Don't worry, my dear young lady,

145
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,475
I'm not asking you to do it
non-stop, I'm not a monster!

146
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:34,479
Just keep fanning yourself.
Suits you nicely!

147
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,114
<i>To do what non-stop?</i>

148
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,249
All the bungalows.

149
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,084
He's kidding!

150
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:43,221
Do I act like it?

151
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:46,257
I'll think it over!

152
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,260
Betty! Stop!

153
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,429
You're insane!

154
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,598
I don't mind painting your crate!

155
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,300
Makes it look more sporty!

156
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,369
But I won't paint your shacks!

157
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:00,471
She's insane!

158
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,142
One wipe and it'll be like now!

159
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:10,415
Got to forgive her,
she's having her period!

160
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,483
I'm sure she's sorry!

161
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:22,326
I'll even paint
the light poles for you!

162
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:25,563
No, the light company
does that, you jerk!

163
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:40,111
Hi! It's me!

164
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:42,947
What did you tell that asshole?

165
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:47,485
Look, he wouldn't let you stay
unless you worked!

166
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:51,155
It's murder
to paint all those shacks!

167
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,424
In a way, yes.

168
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:56,461
"In a way"!
Shit, they're all bastards!

169
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:58,963
We should cut
all their throats!

170
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,933
- How would that help?
- Have you no pride?

171
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,068
I'll paint the whole town pink

172
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:06,337
just to stay with you, kitten!

173
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,241
You're nuts! Look what shit
we're in with that asshole!

174
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:14,245
You let him screw you
and for what? Tell me!

175
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,247
We're all in the same boat!

176
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:19,083
Stop talking bullshit!

177
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:22,453
How can I love you
if I can't admire you?

178
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:25,256
We're only learning
how to die here!

179
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:30,027
See the wind outside,
blowing bits of newspapers by?

180
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:33,931
Papers from the North one day,
from the South the next,

181
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,068
all full of the same bullshit
and we're in between!

182
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,971
Now look, we've got
a nice pad to screw in,

183
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,939
so it's you who's nuts!

184
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:46,244
You nerd! Something's always
wrong with you guys! Shit!

185
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,514
You're a dumb bitch!

186
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:04,128
Always something wrong
with a guy!

187
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:11,135
It's dark in here,
it stinks, it's ugly!

188
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:13,404
I'm fed up!
Can't breathe in here!

189
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:18,676
I'm going to fix your house up
good so I can breathe!

190
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:24,282
Look at all this shit!

191
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:31,689
Not that one, Betty!

192
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:33,424
Why is it so special?

193
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:36,027
Sentimental attachment.

194
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,463
What's all that?

195
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:43,467
Hitler's memoirs.
Give me that box. Please!

196
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,038
Did you write this?

197
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:49,207
Yeah. Ages ago.

198
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,713
You wrote that many pages?

199
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:58,516
Yeah, but it's nothing,
just crap!

200
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:00,651
About what?

201
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:03,421
Just stuff...
I'd almost forgotten.

202
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:06,257
No one forgets stuff like that!

203
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:09,160
Won't you come to bed now?

204
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:14,999
You can't start
reading that now!

205
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,168
You'll see if I can't!

206
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:30,281
<i>Betty was the first one</i>
<i>to read it... quiet at last.</i>

207
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,284
<i>At 30, you begin to know</i>

208
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:36,254
<i>what life's about,</i>
<i>and you enjoy a break.</i>

209
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:05,249
Want some coffee?

210
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:14,325
One lump or two?

211
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:17,995
Two lumps then.

212
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:26,003
I'm going to work now.

213
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:31,309
Do you like it?

214
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:42,019
Oh it's you!
What'll you be painting next?

215
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:44,088
The Sistine Chapel!

216
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:48,526
Actually working! Will you do
the insides afterwards?

217
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:51,028
Yeah, cover up your furniture!

218
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:55,566
I'll start now.
Come and see my girls afterwards.

219
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:48,386
What's this? Is it my birthday?

220
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,654
No, baby, just dinner for two.

221
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,590
What is it?

222
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:56,594
Mussels. I'll pour your wine.

223
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,965
Some spread!

224
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,374
I'm dreaming!

225
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:14,078
Taste it!

226
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:17,214
Like it?

227
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,218
I know that smell.

228
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:25,656
Turkey with chestnuts!
Do you like that?

229
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,359
Love it, Ideal in this season!

230
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,098
What's the occasion?

231
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:36,367
Wait, let me look at you.

232
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:40,137
When I think you wrote that!

233
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:43,274
I've never read
anything like it!

234
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:45,543
You don't realise.

235
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:50,314
Now I see why you came
to this hole. To write that.

236
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,552
To think you paint shacks
drives me crazy!

237
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,222
This world wasn't
exactly made for me.

238
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:01,625
We'll see about that.
Kiss me.

239
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,998
<i>I hadn't come to that hole</i>
to write.

240
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:11,569
<i>It was later</i>
<i>that I started writing.</i>

241
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,404
<i>So I could feel alive.</i>

242
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:17,107
Mornings you start at 11
and now afternoons at 4!

243
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:21,111
It's too hot! But I work
till dark, lots of hours!

244
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:23,380
By the way, I'm out of paint!

245
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:26,217
That's the end of that!

246
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,486
Who are you to talk
to him like that?

247
00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:30,321
I'm not talking to you!

248
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:33,123
Guess who you are talking to?

249
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:35,960
The greatest writer alive, fat ass!

250
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:40,164
Doesn't show on his face!
And she hasn't even got panties on!

251
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:46,003
Take a good look, schmuck!

252
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:50,541
Shut up, you!
Now get your eyes full!

253
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:55,112
She's a real hellcat!

254
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,947
Not hurt, are you?

255
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,917
You asshole!
Now get rid of that girl!

256
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,355
I don't ever want
to see her again!

257
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,937
I think I'll go to work now.

258
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:22,973
Hey, Betty,
I'm going to work.

259
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:33,918
She's in a real frenzy!

260
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,387
She loves housework!

261
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:41,525
There goes the casserole!

262
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:44,261
The ironing board!

263
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:46,196
The record player!

264
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:48,265
My Gershwin record!

265
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,433
Frankly,

266
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,007
I wouldn't want
a housekeeper like her!

267
00:26:57,275 --> 00:26:58,642
I don't blame you.

268
00:27:02,514 --> 00:27:04,081
She's almost through.

269
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:07,551
Your pad will look very Zen now!

270
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:43,921
OK, are you coming?

271
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,327
You're insane!

272
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,449
What? I can't hear!

273
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:49,987
I love you! I love you!

274
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:50,988
Once more!

275
00:28:51,122 --> 00:28:54,124
I love you! I love you!

276
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:56,393
I love him!

277
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,039
We could've taken the train!

278
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,474
This is adventure!

279
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:12,209
Who is she?

280
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:15,979
My best friend. We can stay
with her. She's a widow.

281
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:19,349
What if she's not home?

282
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:21,418
We'll visit Montmartre!

283
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,691
You do trust me, don't you?

284
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:11,935
And the rent?

285
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,272
Could you do odd jobs there
in exchange for rent?

286
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,241
You bet! I'm a plumber!

287
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:20,144
A plumber? Great!
My toilet's broken!

288
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,713
I'll buy the stuff!

289
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:25,349
No, I'll swipe it
from a building site!

290
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,233
What are you doing?

291
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:47,037
Not even a masterpiece
gets read unless it's typed.

292
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:48,438
Can you type?

293
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,341
You plan to type all that?

294
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:53,410
Good luck, sweetie!

295
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,282
- How far are you?
- On page 1.

296
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:04,154
Go away, you confuse me!

297
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:54,037
Lisa's out again tonight

298
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,207
Still like it as much?

299
00:31:57,475 --> 00:31:58,609
Don't you worry.

300
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,478
I may never get published, Betty.

301
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:03,313
Are you kidding?

302
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,249
It's a strange world, baby.

303
00:32:07,085 --> 00:32:08,252
Won't you eat now?

304
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,955
I've boiled some eggs for you!

305
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:13,223
I don't have time!

306
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:22,199
Why stare at me so?

307
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,701
I think you're beautiful.

308
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,236
Then come and kiss me.

309
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:41,638
What are you doing?

310
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:46,276
Repairing the tap. It leaks.

311
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:47,477
Aren't you cold?

312
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,280
I'm not very warm.

313
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:51,581
How's Betty doing?

314
00:34:52,183 --> 00:34:53,316
She's progressing.

315
00:34:59,323 --> 00:35:00,090
And you?

316
00:35:01,926 --> 00:35:03,427
Your eyes are shining.

317
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:07,097
Oh, Zorg. I just got laid!

318
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,499
Really laid!

319
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:13,503
Don't laugh!

320
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:16,406
Who is he?

321
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,675
You'll meet him!

322
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:25,382
Time for bed.

323
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,551
For me too.

324
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:29,953
Smell anything burning?

325
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,658
No, why?

326
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:39,329
Rusty, come on!

327
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,213
Zorg, come here!

328
00:36:01,252 --> 00:36:02,419
Guess what I'm typing?

329
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:07,290
"TH E EN D"

330
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,235
You've got me all wrong.

331
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:23,306
You're a writer, not a plumber
What did I type? A novel!

332
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:26,443
Don't be so dumb!
Play the races if you like,

333
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:29,379
I don't care, but
stop being a plumber, OK?

334
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:33,984
See this list? All the publishers
in this dumb town!

335
00:36:35,353 --> 00:36:36,286
All of them!

336
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:39,956
I think I'll go buy a racing mag.

337
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:47,664
What'll it be?

338
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:51,334
- Tequila
- We don't have that.

339
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:56,306
Pernod then.

340
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:26,236
Is this a turbo?

341
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,005
No, it's a UFO.

342
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:30,507
- Is it yours?
- No.

343
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:32,242
Costs a lot!

344
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:35,145
It's got ABS...

345
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,314
Great brakes!

346
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:41,218
And it can do 150 mph!

347
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:42,385
My dad has one!

348
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:46,089
Your dad has an old crate,
and it's green!

349
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:52,028
There's Zorg!

350
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,101
- And the racing mag?
- Sold out.

351
00:37:58,336 --> 00:38:01,371
Lovejoy, Baby Shark
and Eat-Your-Soup in the lead!

352
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,340
Lovejoy out!

353
00:38:08,012 --> 00:38:09,179
You're Zorg?

354
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:10,580
Eddy Sayolle.

355
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:12,515
Is he your wonder boy?

356
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:17,087
Is that your UFO outside?

357
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:19,356
You bet! Beautiful, isn't she?

358
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,491
Some kids are taking her apart.

359
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,560
Better just give 'em the keys!

360
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:25,362
You're kidding!

361
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,502
How about a ride
on the motorway! 150!

362
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:36,106
No, we have to mail
the manuscripts!

363
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:42,679
The ass she's got!

364
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:46,683
Be careful!

365
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,253
I've got a better idea.

366
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:53,623
Tequila rapido!

367
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:56,526
Tequila rapido!

368
00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:00,597
You take a towel and a glass,

369
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:04,467
and tequila and Schweppes.

370
00:39:13,577 --> 00:39:14,511
Say a prayer!

371
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,014
They'll print it, Betty!

372
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:26,122
Off it goes!

373
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:28,425
So you write books!

374
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,201
Do you make any bread
doing that?

375
00:39:39,537 --> 00:39:40,670
Sometimes!

376
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:47,610
You've got it made!
A soft job behind a desk.

377
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,113
You write, then go get the cash!

378
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:58,088
And what is your... branch?

379
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:06,096
Historical novels!

380
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:17,240
Is that joint yours?

381
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:22,946
Yes, Pizza Stromboli!

382
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:28,351
Eddy's Pizza Parlour!

383
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:37,527
I forget what kind
of books you write!

384
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:39,129
Science fiction!

385
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:54,010
Betty, come and see!

386
00:40:57,615 --> 00:40:59,649
What's going on?

387
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:06,523
We're sinking into debauchery!

388
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:11,494
Fantastic!

389
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:15,999
Don't mess up my stuff!

390
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,301
He's moving in, OK?

391
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:24,007
Don't touch!

392
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:26,209
Do they make 'em for men too?

393
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:29,679
Try one on!

394
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:33,082
It's the only thing
I feel good in.

395
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,419
100% silk!
There's a red one too!

396
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:39,022
Feels sexy!

397
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:42,258
Open the bottles!

398
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:09,319
No mail on Sunday.

399
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:19,496
Have some coffee
and a croissant.

400
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:27,704
I've got a job for you two.

401
00:42:28,405 --> 00:42:29,339
Like what?

402
00:42:29,573 --> 00:42:31,608
"Like what"! A job!

403
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,410
Where's my Milanese?

404
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:37,947
Don't forget those aperitifs
on the terrace!

405
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:42,485
Did you get N 3?

406
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:44,420
This... is yours!

407
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,155
Is it always like this?

408
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:48,124
- And 9?
- Where is 9?

409
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,027
Between 8 and 10 usually.
Good night!

410
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:53,196
Those drinks!

411
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:57,300
Doing OK?

412
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:00,470
- Did you get 9?
- Where is 9?

413
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:01,538
The fat lady!

414
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:04,240
May we order? Really!

415
00:43:07,177 --> 00:43:08,545
Where are the toilets?

416
00:43:11,282 --> 00:43:12,982
Come on, smile!

417
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:16,352
I've had it!

418
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:19,455
That bitch at N 5!
I'll hit her pretty soon!

419
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:21,391
I'll handle her!

420
00:43:24,361 --> 00:43:26,162
Is there some problem?

421
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:28,398
Is that girl an idiot or what?

422
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:31,000
I said pizza with anchovies,
not ham!

423
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:34,537
Try some pimento sauce on it,

424
00:43:34,538 --> 00:43:38,207
No, now give me what I ordered!

425
00:43:38,475 --> 00:43:39,642
I'll see what I can do.

426
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,477
Mine is great! No problem!

427
00:43:42,313 --> 00:43:43,713
What do you need?

428
00:43:43,714 --> 00:43:45,114
Do you know nouvelle cuisine?

429
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:46,149
That's just crap!

430
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:49,419
Wait till you see my repel cuisine!
Watch!

431
00:43:50,654 --> 00:43:54,524
You pick out the worst
garbage you can find,

432
00:43:54,725 --> 00:43:58,161
stinky junk,
bits of sweaty sausage,

433
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:01,130
a little tomato, nice,
fresh spaghetti,

434
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:05,234
an old cheese rind,
lettuce that's good and rotten,

435
00:44:07,304 --> 00:44:08,371
one olive,

436
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:10,406
and there you are!

437
00:44:10,674 --> 00:44:12,475
Now add a little sunshine!

438
00:44:13,143 --> 00:44:14,410
I fofgot the best part!

439
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:16,512
- Oh shit!
- You said it!

440
00:44:19,149 --> 00:44:20,516
How's your pizza?

441
00:44:21,085 --> 00:44:21,584
Hot!

442
00:44:22,152 --> 00:44:23,319
It's you that's hot!

443
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:26,456
You're turning me on!

444
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:28,257
Look out for your blouse!

445
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:29,626
Doesn't matter.

446
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:39,268
- What's wrong?
- I'm tired.

447
00:44:40,704 --> 00:44:42,405
I 'm OK, just tired.

448
00:44:50,547 --> 00:44:52,682
Good-bye and thank you!

449
00:44:59,423 --> 00:45:00,390
A madhouse.

450
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,566
What kind of books do you write?

451
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:12,301
Detective novels.

452
00:45:13,537 --> 00:45:14,537
<i>Any answer yet?</i>

453
00:45:14,538 --> 00:45:15,605
Not yet.

454
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:18,508
Are you insane?

455
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:20,510
Shut up!

456
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,412
You're insane! Call the manager!

457
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:23,613
What's wrong?

458
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:26,282
The service was rotten
all evening!

459
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,419
And now this little fool
won't get my coat!

460
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:30,987
I'll pay their bill!

461
00:45:31,388 --> 00:45:33,923
Keep out of this!
Go back to your dishes!

462
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,258
Beat it!

463
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,527
You're crazy!

464
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:38,494
Insane!

465
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:39,996
Shut up!

466
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:44,000
Throw them out, Eddy!

467
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,153
What's the matter?

468
00:46:05,389 --> 00:46:06,656
Nothing, she'll be OK.

469
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:09,025
Shit, tell me what happened!

470
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:10,326
Leave me alone with her!

471
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,128
Put water on her face.

472
00:46:14,364 --> 00:46:15,264
I'll get some.

473
00:46:15,265 --> 00:46:17,033
Beat it, Eddy! Shit!

474
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:55,271
What was it? Is she sick?

475
00:46:55,706 --> 00:46:57,640
Look, don't you ever get mad?

476
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:01,244
Mad, yes, but that scared me!

477
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:04,380
Now don't say it was nothing!

478
00:47:04,648 --> 00:47:06,649
She almost killed that woman!

479
00:47:07,251 --> 00:47:07,950
Bullshit!

480
00:47:13,924 --> 00:47:15,324
With your royalties...

481
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,561
Shit, stop bugging me
about "my books"!

482
00:47:18,996 --> 00:47:22,665
I've only written one
in all my life!

483
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:26,969
And I doubt I could write
another one! "Royalties"!

484
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:30,239
I thought...

485
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:31,541
You thought what?

486
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:33,042
She told you that?

487
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,145
She found a manuscript
and thinks I'm a genius.

488
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:39,081
Keeps waiting
for publishers to reply.

489
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:41,117
That drives her nuts.

490
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:46,656
She may be right

491
00:47:48,192 --> 00:47:49,125
About what?

492
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:51,527
That you're a genius.

493
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:56,065
You bet! Read this, toots!

494
00:47:58,602 --> 00:47:59,669
"United Books.

495
00:48:01,371 --> 00:48:05,541

"You deliberately
wrote a non-book..."

497
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,280
Who is this queer?

498
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:14,417
Hide that quick!

499
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:19,388
How are you today?

500
00:48:24,928 --> 00:48:25,661
What's wrong with him?

501
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:28,130
Something he can't swallow.

502
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:31,300
I see. Well, I feel great!

503
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:36,505
Any mail yet?

504
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,341
I didn't look.

We're bound to rum into morons.

520
00:49:52,683 --> 00:49:54,283
It won't kill us.

521
00:49:57,688 --> 00:49:59,488
It's not important, my love.

522
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:04,460
OK, it's not important.

523
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:07,263
I'm going to a doctor.

524
00:50:07,497 --> 00:50:08,431
Anything wrong?

525
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:12,101
No, just to see if my IUD is OK.
Coming with me?

526
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:17,073
I'll put some makeup on first.

527
00:50:17,975 --> 00:50:20,977
I love to look at old magazines,
it's reassuring.

528
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,113
I look silly, give me my jacket!

529
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:26,282
But I look good in it!

530
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,351
Is this it? There's no plaque!

531
00:50:30,754 --> 00:50:33,422
Stop it, he's not deaf!

532
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:40,162
Yes? What can I do for you?

533
00:50:40,364 --> 00:50:42,098
My wife has an appointment.

534
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:43,699
Did you write this?
- That?

535
00:50:44,134 --> 00:50:46,035
You recognise this, don't you?

536
00:50:46,536 --> 00:50:48,571
Who signed this?

537
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,241
Shitty asshole publisher!

538
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:53,743
Yes, I'm mad as hell!

539
00:50:54,478 --> 00:50:55,544
I'll clean it all up.

540
00:50:56,146 --> 00:50:57,546
You shithead!

541
00:50:57,714 --> 00:50:59,415
Tell him what you think!

542
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:02,284
I don't give a damn
about his letter!

543
00:51:02,552 --> 00:51:05,221
In your writing
as well as your speech,

544
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:07,690
you show no notion
of good taste!

545
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,425
And you think you do!

546
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:11,394
Get out! This is my home!

547
00:51:12,129 --> 00:51:13,262
Stop making a scene!

548
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:15,664
You're mad!

549
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:23,072
She's insane!

550
00:51:32,616 --> 00:51:34,316
Go on, dance!

551
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,300
Come here, I'm all alone!

552
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,369
I'm coming, baby!

553
00:52:04,014 --> 00:52:07,483
<i>It's dy ... it's na... It's mite...</i>
<i>it's dynamite!</i>

554
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:21,964
The sauce!

555
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,202
I would've loved to be a rocker!

556
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:29,238
Shit, he's a real rocker!

557
00:52:34,678 --> 00:52:36,011
Come and help me!

558
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:44,487
I'm not making it
with cheap wine but...

559
00:52:45,722 --> 00:52:47,189
with champagne!

560
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:56,298
Pizza Stromboli!

561
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:15,384
What's wrong, Eddy?

562
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,488
My mother's dead.

563
00:53:20,023 --> 00:53:22,291
Shit, my mother's dead!

564
00:53:25,028 --> 00:53:26,295
I feel awful!

565
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:34,403
Is this your only black tie?

566
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:38,941
I have to be there.

567
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:46,649
For the funeral.

568
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:52,054
You should get
a little rest now, darling.

569
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:56,725
I have to dress.

570
00:53:58,261 --> 00:53:59,995
Give me my jacket.

571
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:06,468
No, sleep, and
I'll call you a cab later.

572
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:11,240
560 miles.
If I leave now, I'll make it,

573
00:54:11,474 --> 00:54:15,344
You're nuts, you'll never
make it in one piece!

574
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:17,046
We won't let you go alone!

575
00:54:17,414 --> 00:54:20,316
You don't realise!
My mother's dead!

576
00:54:23,486 --> 00:54:24,954
Help him.

577
00:54:41,104 --> 00:54:42,504
It's not funny.

578
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:45,307
Cut it out, it's not funny!

579
00:57:34,611 --> 00:57:36,078
What's all that noise?

580
00:57:36,446 --> 00:57:38,380
That's not a Christian way to be!

581
00:57:38,615 --> 00:57:40,315
It's OK. Forget it,

582
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,617
Your poor mother's upstairs!

583
00:57:42,051 --> 00:57:45,287
It's Christian enough.
They're my friends.

584
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:48,090
I didn't know you could play.

585
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:50,993
I can't. Just 2 or 3 things.

586
00:57:53,563 --> 00:57:54,997
You're a funny girl.

587
00:57:57,434 --> 00:57:59,468
I waited ages
for a meaning in life.

588
00:58:00,937 --> 00:58:04,039
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

589
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:07,943
You're only saying that
because you're tired.

590
00:58:09,045 --> 00:58:12,281
If I'd written that book,
I'd have a meaning in life.

591
00:58:12,515 --> 00:58:14,650
It's only bringing us trouble.

592
00:58:15,985 --> 00:58:20,055
It's not because you wrote it.
You <i>are</i> a writer!

593
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:24,059
Then why can't I write
anymore now?

594
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:26,962
Because you're a prize dumbbell.

595
00:58:27,997 --> 00:58:29,364
Thank you.

596
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:34,670
You look tired.

597
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:36,638
I'm OK.

598
00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:49,284
Did you see
all those stars?

599
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:26,522
A life isn't much.

600
00:59:28,925 --> 00:59:30,225
Just 4 photos.

601
00:59:51,414 --> 00:59:52,381
Like it here?

602
00:59:52,515 --> 00:59:53,982
It's different!

603
00:59:58,288 --> 01:00:01,690
I want to make you and Betty
an offer.

604
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:05,961
Stay here and rum the piano store.

605
01:00:06,963 --> 01:00:08,463
See? I'm psychic!

606
01:00:11,634 --> 01:00:13,535
Shall I go ask Betty?

607
01:00:14,003 --> 01:00:16,672
Tell me, do you like the idea?

608
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,173
Yes I do.

609
01:00:28,051 --> 01:00:29,451
Fantastic!

610
01:00:34,991 --> 01:00:36,158
Just one thing...

611
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:41,697
Take her flowers now and then.

612
01:00:42,131 --> 01:00:44,166
- Who?
- My mother.

613
01:00:48,204 --> 01:00:52,040
He sure gave us a nice present!

614
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:56,044
No, I just can't do it!

615
01:00:57,513 --> 01:00:59,081
Sleep in a dead woman's bed!

616
01:00:59,349 --> 01:01:03,118
I know it's no fun,
but just don't think about it!

617
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:05,187
No, I refuse!

618
01:01:05,421 --> 01:01:08,323
Shit, I don't believe it,

619
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:16,064
Do you know how late it is?

620
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:20,302
We'll just use this foldaway.

621
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:26,375
Let me, it's a man's job!

622
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:33,615
Stupid thing!

623
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,084
You said it was a man's job!

624
01:01:36,452 --> 01:01:37,719
What is this?

625
01:01:41,457 --> 01:01:42,691
Can't you do it, man?

626
01:01:49,565 --> 01:01:50,699
Shitty thing!

627
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:55,137
Calm down. Use the pedal!

628
01:01:55,505 --> 01:01:57,539
The pedal is stuck, Betty!

629
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:00,909
I'll go get the tools then!

630
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:04,913
Hell, not at this time of night!

631
01:02:13,423 --> 01:02:14,990
I didn't do it on purpose!

632
01:02:18,294 --> 01:02:21,596
Let's stop, it'll only get worse.

633
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:23,965
It's safer.

634
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:27,436
"Sleep Away the Foldaway Way!"

635
01:02:28,671 --> 01:02:30,338
What are you up to?

636
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:33,542
It gives off bad vibes.
You don't feel 'em of course!

637
01:02:40,016 --> 01:02:43,018
The bad vibes are gone now!

638
01:02:52,361 --> 01:02:53,528
<i>I liked that place.</i>

639
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,565
<i>Sunny weather, sunny people.</i>

640
01:02:57,767 --> 01:03:00,602
<i>As if they'd all</i>
<i>had their motors tuned.</i>

641
01:03:56,359 --> 01:03:59,928
Guys freak out
over a full tank of gas.

642
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,498
Big cars are the last flash

643
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:05,667
of our civilization.

644
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:11,640
I thought we were broke.

645
01:04:12,642 --> 01:04:13,975
We are now.

646
01:04:14,477 --> 01:04:17,012
I lay this gift at your feet!

647
01:04:18,014 --> 01:04:19,314
You're crazy!

648
01:04:21,517 --> 01:04:23,518
I'll tan your hide, damnmit!

649
01:04:24,954 --> 01:04:26,454
I'm really fed up!

650
01:04:27,023 --> 01:04:29,257
He locked himself
in the bathroom.

651
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:32,394
And that window is so high!

652
01:04:32,562 --> 01:04:34,596
Why do we ever have children?

653
01:04:37,433 --> 01:04:38,266
What's wrong?

654
01:04:38,534 --> 01:04:40,235
I'm dizzy, I can't do it!

655
01:04:40,469 --> 01:04:43,572
Let me do it!

656
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:52,681
Be careful!

657
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:55,383
Bob! Hurry, come on!

658
01:04:55,618 --> 01:04:57,953
Come on, yourself!
Makes me dizzy!

659
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:05,360
Archie! Why do you do this?

660
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:07,329
Your dad's going to wallop you!

661
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,967
He's OK, Bob.

662
01:05:12,435 --> 01:05:14,970
I'll leave you here till you dry!

663
01:05:17,306 --> 01:05:20,408
That's for Pearl Harbor!
Yesterday,

664
01:05:20,676 --> 01:05:24,412
he shut himself in the fridge.
Fancied himself an arctic explorer!

665
01:05:25,014 --> 01:05:26,081
You little moron!

666
01:05:27,183 --> 01:05:29,417
Let me offer you a drink.

667
01:05:29,418 --> 01:05:31,453
I insist!
You did me a favour!

668
01:05:32,455 --> 01:05:34,389
Darling, what did he do to you?

669
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:39,261
Ever hear about
the 3 supermarket witches?

670
01:05:39,495 --> 01:05:41,296
A great story! I'll tell you.

671
01:05:42,198 --> 01:05:42,697
Sit down!

672
01:05:59,515 --> 01:06:00,615
Real hungry.

673
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:06,221
They're so hard they almost hurt.

674
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:10,659
Touch and you'll see.

675
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:14,396
Go on, touch.

676
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:21,069
Feel that?

677
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,103
Awfully hard.

678
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:23,038
They hurt.

679
01:06:26,442 --> 01:06:28,109
You've got goldfish!

680
01:06:33,182 --> 01:06:34,115
Real goldfish!

681
01:06:42,692 --> 01:06:45,360
How about some Pineau?

682
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:48,296
Got anything to munch with it?

683
01:06:49,165 --> 01:06:52,033
Help yourself in the shop!

684
01:06:59,008 --> 01:07:03,011
Bananas, coconuts, apricots.
No, that's all sweet.

685
01:07:03,379 --> 01:07:07,115
I want almonds or peanuts.

686
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:13,221
Eat my pussy! Eat it!

687
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:16,491
Hurry!

688
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,369
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

689
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:32,107
I don't turn you on!

690
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:35,143
It's not that.
Sometimes I resist my desires

691
01:07:35,544 --> 01:07:37,345
in order to feel I'm free.

692
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,084
I'm fed up!

693
01:07:43,085 --> 01:07:45,553
Forget it, Let's go have a drink.

694
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:51,926
Bob hasn't touched me
for a month!

695
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:54,095
Not since I left the clinic.

696
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:57,999
Is it normal
to have to wait so long?

697
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:00,068
It'll all work out.

698
01:08:03,072 --> 01:08:04,339
I'm sure it will!

699
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:08,343
Sometime when we're in bed,
he'll...

700
01:08:09,178 --> 01:08:10,945
slip it in from behind

701
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,551
without caring if
I'm asleep or...

702
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,888
Let's have those drinks.

703
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,334
The goldfish love that tune!

704
01:08:34,537 --> 01:08:36,471
I've bored you long enough now.

705
01:08:36,705 --> 01:08:38,073
<i>You're not boring me.</i>

706
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:40,008
Wait, Betty wants...

707
01:08:43,646 --> 01:08:45,980
I almost forgot...

708
01:08:46,348 --> 01:08:49,984
Betty wants
to knock out two walls.

709
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:52,487
Eddy? Can you hear me?

710
01:08:52,721 --> 01:08:56,124
It's nothing,
just two thin little walls.

711
01:08:57,393 --> 01:09:00,328
<i>What do you mean "nothing"?</i>
You're both nutty.

712
01:09:00,563 --> 01:09:02,263
Wait, imagine that wall

713
01:09:02,498 --> 01:09:04,532
as a barrier between us

714
01:09:04,967 --> 01:09:07,969
and a sunny meadow.
Isn't it an insult

715
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:11,339
to let a silly
little barrier bug us?

716
01:09:13,342 --> 01:09:15,577
<i>OK, but go #easy now.</i>

717
01:09:16,312 --> 01:09:18,546
Don't worry, we're not crazy.

718
01:09:20,216 --> 01:09:21,883
All right, bye!

719
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,674
Do I look like Stallone
in Rocky IV, baby?

720
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,482
No, like you writing your book.

721
01:09:54,717 --> 01:09:58,253
I don't see what demolition
has to do with writing.

722
01:10:01,557 --> 01:10:03,358
I'm not surprised.

723
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:35,490
Want to go shopping with me?

724
01:10:41,263 --> 01:10:42,297
Do you want to?

725
01:10:44,733 --> 01:10:46,301
I'll go alone then!

726
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:38,720
You're acting like shit today!

727
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:50,531
You're out of your mind!
Calm down!

728
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:15,056
Stop!

729
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:20,528
Shit, Betty, stop!

730
01:12:25,968 --> 01:12:26,934
Enough!

731
01:12:37,212 --> 01:12:38,613
Betty, please!

732
01:12:49,758 --> 01:12:50,725
It's over, okay?

733
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:28,196
What's going on here?

734
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:31,432
Nothing, she didn't feel well,
so I slapped her.

735
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:34,001
I was afraid.

736
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:38,239
she'd have a fit.
I know that's hard to believe!

737
01:13:38,474 --> 01:13:40,408
Why is that hard to believe?

738
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:42,543
We'd just been jogging!

739
01:13:43,145 --> 01:13:44,479
Does jogging help?

740
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,446
A lot, yeah.

741
01:13:46,048 --> 01:13:48,516
And how is the little lady now?

742
01:13:50,052 --> 01:13:52,720
I told you
not to point that at me!

743
01:13:53,422 --> 01:13:55,423
I'm aiming at him, not you!

744
01:13:55,691 --> 01:13:56,624
Put it down!

745
01:13:57,626 --> 01:13:58,993
Look at his shoes!

746
01:14:01,363 --> 01:14:04,465
We saw a guy with green hair
one day too.

747
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,602
The world's like that.
Don't go by details.

748
01:14:09,138 --> 01:14:10,505
It's only an accident!

749
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,975
If we goof some day,
it'll be your fault!

750
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:17,645
Did you search him? No!
You just like to carry a pistol!

751
01:14:18,213 --> 01:14:20,114
Don't get mad! Look at them!

752
01:14:20,616 --> 01:14:24,485
I'd clobber him in a sec!
I've had 40 years' experience!

753
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:28,489
Then work it out alone,
count me out!

754
01:14:34,563 --> 01:14:36,397
Always blowing your top!

755
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:40,501
Open cup! Cut it out!

756
01:14:40,736 --> 01:14:43,538
I'll give you 2 seconds!

757
01:14:43,972 --> 01:14:46,441
OK, I'll stop!

758
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,644
Next time, you've had it!

759
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:52,313
Our recruits get good training,

760
01:14:53,682 --> 01:14:56,684
but it wrecks their nerves!

761
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:58,619
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

762
01:15:00,189 --> 01:15:03,090
Are you just passing through?

763
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:05,593
No, we rum the piano store.

764
01:15:08,664 --> 01:15:12,266
Friends of Eddy's?
You should've said so!

765
01:15:12,668 --> 01:15:14,669
We'll drive you back!

766
01:15:15,137 --> 01:15:16,938
Come on, Betty.

767
01:15:24,713 --> 01:15:25,980
Good and ripe.

768
01:15:32,154 --> 01:15:32,987
What else?

769
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:34,188
Ham.

770
01:15:34,556 --> 01:15:35,923
Round or square?

771
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:39,160
Did you hear about
the butcher's wife

772
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:43,064
and the postman?
No shame at all. Two slices?

773
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:44,031
Four.

774
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:46,300
Bob, I'm in a jam!

775
01:15:46,602 --> 01:15:47,935
And I'm in a ham.

776
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:51,172
I have a piano and my
delivery men didn't show up!

777
01:15:51,707 --> 01:15:56,444
It has to be delivered! Your brother-
in-law's got a truck, hasn't he?

778
01:15:57,579 --> 01:16:00,381
It's too big,
it's a logging truck!

779
01:16:00,649 --> 01:16:05,019
I'll manage! I can slue around
with the biggest ones!

780
01:16:05,387 --> 01:16:06,087
So no problem!

781
01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:10,625
Annie, come here!

782
01:16:12,995 --> 01:16:15,029
I'll phone him.

783
01:16:17,566 --> 01:16:20,234
Tell him I'll come back later.

784
01:16:20,602 --> 01:16:22,169
OK, I'll do that.

785
01:16:32,281 --> 01:16:33,981
Hi, Annie.

786
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:38,653
Have things improved with Bob?

787
01:16:41,023 --> 01:16:44,492
A little, why?

788
01:16:47,095 --> 01:16:48,129
What's on your mind?

789
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,265
Nothing, and that takes
all my strength!

790
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:56,270
You sure are a funny guy.

791
01:16:59,207 --> 01:16:59,974
I doubt that.

792
01:17:03,245 --> 01:17:05,279
27 tons! Think it'll do?

793
01:17:08,116 --> 01:17:09,617
Hey, this must be worth plenty!

794
01:17:23,165 --> 01:17:25,633
Must be worth a lot of bread!

795
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:29,103
Spare me your comments!
Know how to work this?

796
01:17:34,009 --> 01:17:36,010
Just press, it's easy!

797
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:38,179
Shall I press?

798
01:17:40,048 --> 01:17:43,317
Oh, shit! Asshole!

799
01:17:44,519 --> 01:17:48,122
That's the oil release!
Try the other one!

800
01:17:49,157 --> 01:17:50,091
Now watch!

801
01:17:57,165 --> 01:17:58,199
Got a manual?

802
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,001
Yeah, there's a manual.

803
01:18:06,642 --> 01:18:07,575
What're you up to?

804
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:10,244
What are you up to?

805
01:18:10,646 --> 01:18:11,979
I can't hear!

806
01:18:13,115 --> 01:18:14,048
Come on down!

807
01:18:16,985 --> 01:18:18,152
What are you up to?

808
01:18:21,657 --> 01:18:24,225
You jerk!
Know what that piano's worth?

809
01:18:24,593 --> 01:18:25,960
You wouldn't tell me!

810
01:18:30,966 --> 01:18:33,200
I'm coming!
Did you tie it down?

811
01:18:34,202 --> 01:18:35,503
The lady's waiting!

812
01:18:35,937 --> 01:18:36,470
Let me go.

813
01:18:36,705 --> 01:18:38,172
I have to tell you!

814
01:18:39,641 --> 01:18:42,176
I'm selling a piano!
I'm an hour late!

815
01:18:43,545 --> 01:18:44,679
She'll be hopping mad!

816
01:18:46,114 --> 01:18:46,647
I'm coming!

817
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:51,519
What's that?

818
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:54,088
Dust from Atlantis?

819
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:58,192
It's a pregnancy test.

820
01:18:58,994 --> 01:19:00,928
And what does it say?

821
01:19:01,196 --> 01:19:02,029
It says yes!

822
01:19:03,231 --> 01:19:06,133
But how, with your IUD?

823
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:07,868
Happens sometimes.

824
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:11,205
It can't be true!

825
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:20,081
Sit down. I'll be right back
to look after you!

826
01:19:21,116 --> 01:19:21,949
It's great, eh?

827
01:19:29,991 --> 01:19:33,094
What's wrong?
You look like a ghost?

828
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:34,428
We're late as hell!

829
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:40,601
Never saw so many
baby carriages!

830
01:19:41,036 --> 01:19:42,536
We almost made one less!

831
01:19:44,272 --> 01:19:46,507
Not so fast!
The truck's brand new!

832
01:19:46,975 --> 01:19:49,110
I'm not going fast!
Anyway, it's a turbo!

833
01:19:49,344 --> 01:19:51,045
What? Are you kidding?

834
01:19:54,282 --> 01:19:56,217
I'm only going 25 mph!

835
01:19:57,219 --> 01:19:59,587
25? You're going 50!

836
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:01,655
50? That's not fast!

837
01:20:05,026 --> 01:20:06,260
Got your licence?

838
01:20:07,295 --> 01:20:08,129
I doubt it,

839
01:20:14,503 --> 01:20:16,070
Hi there! Remember me?

840
01:20:16,438 --> 01:20:19,974
Doing 60 with a truck
limited to 45 mph

841
01:20:20,675 --> 01:20:23,210
on a road limited
to 15-ton vehicles

842
01:20:24,012 --> 01:20:27,982
and to 30 mph. Not bad, not bad.

843
01:20:29,317 --> 01:20:32,987
Your papers... full inspection...
the whole bit,

844
01:20:33,221 --> 01:20:34,488
Sorry, I was dreaming!

845
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:39,260
If you flunk the alcohol test,
you'll wake up fast.

846
01:20:40,162 --> 01:20:42,062
I just found out
I'm to be a father!

847
01:20:42,664 --> 01:20:43,397
What?

848
01:20:44,065 --> 01:20:44,698
A father!

849
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:49,970
Got a cigarette?

850
01:20:50,105 --> 01:20:51,172
Sure.

851
01:20:54,109 --> 01:20:56,577
Fathers!
Bravest daredevils of all!

852
01:20:59,748 --> 01:21:02,483
You'll see... there's joy...
but sorrow too,

853
01:21:03,084 --> 01:21:03,918
sorrow.

854
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:10,090
<i>Take a child by the hand.</i>

855
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,962
<i>Lead him into futureland.</i>

856
01:21:16,431 --> 01:21:19,967
<i>Give him a confident stride.</i>

857
01:21:21,136 --> 01:21:22,403
<i>Treat a child</i>

858
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:24,471
<i>like a king.</i>

859
01:21:25,073 --> 01:21:31,312
<i>Hold him with pride</i>
<i>Close to your side.</i>

860
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:01,108
What does it feel like?

861
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:05,980
I don't know.
I want another test to be sure.

862
01:22:08,049 --> 01:22:09,216
Do you like the idea?

863
01:22:10,485 --> 01:22:11,518
I don't know.

864
01:22:14,022 --> 01:22:16,056
But I'd say it's not so bad.

865
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,426
As a present to you.

866
01:22:49,557 --> 01:22:53,527
<i>We made love.</i>
<i>I had a dizzy sensation:</i>

867
01:22:57,465 --> 01:22:59,967
<i>while we screwed,</i>
<i>her IUD was like</i>

868
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:02,436
<i>a broken door</i>
<i>banging in the wind.</i>

869
01:23:34,302 --> 01:23:36,203
Now you strangle me
and rape me?

870
01:23:36,438 --> 01:23:37,171
Yeah.

871
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:39,139
Better rape me first.

872
01:23:39,374 --> 01:23:40,107
All right

873
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:44,678
Look.

874
01:23:53,221 --> 01:23:54,388
See the little wall?

875
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,123
The Little Wall of China?

876
01:23:56,358 --> 01:23:58,392
The one that starts at the lake.

877
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,060
And that big rock, see?

878
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:02,329
- That big thing?
- Yeah.

879
01:24:03,665 --> 01:24:04,631
Beautiful.

880
01:24:05,266 --> 01:24:07,301
And isn't that
little house nice?

881
01:24:08,303 --> 01:24:10,337
But what are you driving at?

882
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:14,008
I love this place!

883
01:24:15,577 --> 01:24:17,378
You're right, it's perfect.

884
01:24:17,645 --> 01:24:20,414
Everything in its place
Fantastic.

885
01:24:23,418 --> 01:24:24,418
It's all for you.

886
01:24:25,053 --> 01:24:25,986
All of it!

887
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:32,960
It starts at the wall
and goes beyond the rock.

888
01:24:33,428 --> 01:24:35,596
And the house
is in the middle.

889
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:40,234
And that's not all!

890
01:25:02,924 --> 01:25:04,091
Happy birthday, my love!

891
01:25:04,325 --> 01:25:05,259
20 years old!

892
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:06,994
Have to eat it now!

893
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:54,274
I dreamed
your book was published.

894
01:25:56,611 --> 01:26:00,180
Why don't you think
of something else?

895
01:26:05,186 --> 01:26:06,353
Give me a cigarette.

896
01:26:17,499 --> 01:26:19,099
What's this medicine?

897
01:26:20,568 --> 01:26:22,369
Nothing. Just so I can sleep.

898
01:26:23,605 --> 01:26:25,272
Hey, what do you mean?

899
01:26:27,142 --> 01:26:29,076
I don't take them often.

900
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:16,290
- Who's that kid?
- What kid?

901
01:27:16,558 --> 01:27:17,157
Downstairs.

902
01:27:18,059 --> 01:27:19,092
That's Nicolas!

903
01:27:24,232 --> 01:27:26,900
A young genius,
but he hasn't got a piano.

904
01:27:27,268 --> 01:27:27,968
What's this?

905
01:27:28,236 --> 01:27:31,972
Champagne! One bottle apiece.
And ice-cream

906
01:27:32,974 --> 01:27:34,441
with passion fruit in it,

907
01:27:35,543 --> 01:27:36,910
That's for you!

908
01:27:54,963 --> 01:27:56,230
We never know

909
01:27:56,531 --> 01:27:58,298
And they never shrink!

910
01:28:11,613 --> 01:28:12,446
I love you.

911
01:28:37,305 --> 01:28:39,640
S'funny.
Champagne usually wakes me up.

912
01:28:40,174 --> 01:28:43,410
Don't do that to me now!
Not tonight!

913
01:28:44,012 --> 01:28:47,114
Thirsty?
Want something to drink?

914
01:28:52,687 --> 01:28:53,920
You're no fun.

915
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,257
No fun at all.

916
01:29:14,342 --> 01:29:18,645
Let's play Scrabble! You love that!
I'll let you win, OK?

917
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:29,022
You're no fun
to leave me all alone!

918
01:29:34,362 --> 01:29:35,629
Your bag is ugly.

919
01:31:43,224 --> 01:31:47,661
PREGNANCY DIAGNOSIS:
NEGATIVE.

920
01:33:45,212 --> 01:33:48,315
Aren't you glad to see
Eddy and Lisa? And Rusty?

921
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,087
Even bald I'd love you!

922
01:33:57,725 --> 01:33:59,092
Life is against me.

923
01:34:00,461 --> 01:34:02,495
If I want anything,
it's denied me.

924
01:34:04,098 --> 01:34:05,599
I can't even manage
to have a baby.

925
01:34:31,058 --> 01:34:31,691
Answer me!

926
01:34:33,027 --> 01:34:33,960
What's wrong?

927
01:34:37,698 --> 01:34:39,499
Your hair looks fine!

928
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:46,172
You should swim a bit,
The water's just right!

929
01:34:51,312 --> 01:34:52,479
You're insane!

930
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,617
What're you doing?

931
01:35:40,261 --> 01:35:42,395
My Betty... Come back.

932
01:35:47,068 --> 01:35:47,600
It's me.

933
01:35:50,971 --> 01:35:52,005
I hear voices.

934
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,977
No, that's the wind.

935
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,381
Some nut always
has a radio on at 3 a.m.,

936
01:36:01,649 --> 01:36:03,550
waiting for World War III.

937
01:36:03,984 --> 01:36:07,454
I hear the voices in my head!

938
01:36:08,222 --> 01:36:09,389
I'm going insane!

939
01:36:20,134 --> 01:36:21,501
It's all over now.

940
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:30,610
Mine's got hot pants
and yours is going bananas.

941
01:36:33,447 --> 01:36:35,482
Don't ever say that!

942
01:36:42,957 --> 01:36:43,990
I'm sorry.

943
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:27,233
Don't panic!

944
01:37:27,601 --> 01:37:30,036
- What happened?
- Please sit down.

945
01:37:30,404 --> 01:37:31,471
Where's Betty?

946
01:37:31,705 --> 01:37:32,539
Stay here!

947
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:41,948
Can't be true!

948
01:37:42,183 --> 01:37:43,116
Don't stay here.

949
01:37:45,219 --> 01:37:47,587
Bob, what happened?

950
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:51,257
She poked an eye out.

951
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,073
That's not possible!

952
01:38:07,374 --> 01:38:09,509
This look awful, but she'll live.

953
01:41:08,622 --> 01:41:09,655
Yes, speaking.

954
01:41:14,461 --> 01:41:17,130
What? You've read it?

955
01:41:19,666 --> 01:41:22,001
No, I believe you.
I'm just surprised.

956
01:41:23,203 --> 01:41:24,504
It hasn't come yet.

957
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:34,447
OK, I'll sign every page...
I want 15%.

958
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,620
OK, 10%.
I don't give a shit.

959
01:41:42,723 --> 01:41:44,157
No, I can't travel now.

960
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:50,129
Yes, I'm doing another one,
but I can't explain. Just stuff

961
01:41:50,497 --> 01:41:51,431
that pops into mind.

962
01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:56,636
Betty, we did it! The book's
going to be published!

963
01:42:03,143 --> 01:42:05,278
What have they done to you?

964
01:42:09,216 --> 01:42:12,318
The dirty bastards!

965
01:42:39,379 --> 01:42:44,417
We're going to make it, my love.
I'm writing another book.

966
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:47,420
For you.

967
01:42:51,592 --> 01:42:53,292
For you? Betty!

968
01:42:57,464 --> 01:42:58,631
Dedicated to you.

969
01:43:02,069 --> 01:43:03,336
What are you doing here?

970
01:43:05,205 --> 01:43:06,372
What did you do to her?

971
01:43:06,607 --> 01:43:09,075
You're crazy! Get out!

972
01:43:09,309 --> 01:43:12,645
What is all this shit?
I want to see her doctor!

973
01:43:13,547 --> 01:43:15,014
What is this shit?

974
01:43:15,382 --> 01:43:16,315
Tell me!

975
01:43:18,285 --> 01:43:20,653
Sit down!

976
01:43:21,221 --> 01:43:22,388
I need to talk to you.

977
01:43:25,192 --> 01:43:29,162
She's in a state of shock!
Know what that means?

978
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:34,400
- Serious?
- We can't predict the outcome.

979
01:43:35,102 --> 01:43:37,003
I can't guarantee that

980
01:43:37,304 --> 01:43:38,638
she'll ever recover.

981
01:43:41,308 --> 01:43:43,009
Be brave, my boy!

982
01:43:44,044 --> 01:43:46,279
Chemistry
has made great strides.

983
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:48,181
Electrotherapy gets results.

984
01:43:48,448 --> 01:43:51,984
Ignore all those dumb lies!
There's no danger!

985
01:43:52,219 --> 01:43:53,286
I'm taking her home!

986
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,956
You're joking!
That girl is totally insane!

987
01:43:57,758 --> 01:44:00,126
Shut up, shut up!

988
01:44:01,461 --> 01:44:04,463
It's your medicine
that drove her mad!

989
01:44:05,132 --> 01:44:07,266
Your shit's wrecking her mind!

990
01:44:09,136 --> 01:44:11,370
You're making her sick!

991
01:44:26,053 --> 01:44:29,388
I said beat it! Get lost!

992
01:44:34,494 --> 01:44:35,428
I'll slug you!

993
01:44:35,696 --> 01:44:36,929
Forget it!

994
01:46:04,985 --> 01:46:07,453
I keep hearing your voice
in the house, Betty.

995
01:46:11,325 --> 01:46:13,225
Worst of all, the silence,

996
01:46:16,129 --> 01:46:17,596
and words that just pop up:

997
01:46:22,269 --> 01:46:24,403
"Can't find the damn sugar!"

998
01:46:27,474 --> 01:46:28,641
"You're kidding."

999
01:46:31,478 --> 01:46:33,279
"That shitty vacuum cleaner!"

1000
01:46:36,149 --> 01:46:39,552
"Zorg, are you asleep?"

1001
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:55,034
We're going away together.

1002
01:47:03,343 --> 01:47:04,610
Make one last effort.

1003
01:47:27,567 --> 01:47:29,502
We were meant for each other.

1004
01:47:30,604 --> 01:47:34,039
No one can ever separate us,
no one, ever.

1005
01:52:33,106 --> 01:52:34,273
Are you writing?

1006
01:52:36,309 --> 01:52:37,476
Just thinking.
