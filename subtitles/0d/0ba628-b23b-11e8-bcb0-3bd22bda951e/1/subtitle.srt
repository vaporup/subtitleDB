00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:08,659
# Faithless lover's kiss #

2
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:14,001
# Is written on the wind #

3
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:19,669
# A night of stolen bliss #

4
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,077
# Is written #

5
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:25,582
# On the wind #

6
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:31,214
# Just like the dying leaves #

7
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:35,350
# Our dreams we've calmly #

8
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,430
# Thrown away #

9
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:44,333
# Now they've blown away #

10
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,339
# Softly flown away #

11
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:53,310
# The promises we made #

12
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:58,748
# Our whispers in the breeze #

13
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:04,312
# They echo and they fade #

14
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:10,020
# Just like our memories #

15
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,690
# Though you are gone #

16
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,199
# From me #

17
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,739
# We never can really be #

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,172
# Apart #

19
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:27,405
# What's written on the wind #

20
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:33,247
# Is written in my heart #

21
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:09,038
Hello.

22
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,845
- What happened to Mrs. Black?
- My predecessor? She was paroled.

23
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,318
So you're the new
executive secretary, huh?

24
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,118
Don't let that title deceive you.
I do everything but wipe windshields.

25
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,693
- I'm Mitch Wayne.
- Yes, I recognized you.

26
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,161
- I'm Lucy Moore.
- Recognized me? From where?

27
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,494
Oh, come now.
Surely you realize...

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,194
how often your photograph
has graced our tabloids?

29
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:35,330
But the captions usually read, "Kyle Hadley,
Prince Charming of the oil empire, and friend."

30
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,137
The dashing Kyle Hadley.

31
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,439
I saw him dash through
the office recently.

32
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,707
Seems he misplaced
his money belt.

33
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:47,479
- Again?
- A hat was passed, and I contributed $16.47.

34
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:51,113
Well, for that, you ought to get
an oil well named after you.

35
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:54,852
- Your boss in?
- No, Mr. Ryan's out of town.

36
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,054
- I guess you'll have to pinch-hit for him.
- What can I do for you?

37
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:01,496
Kyle Hadley's at 21,
in the mood for a conference.

38
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,832
- Business, of course.
- Look, I'm only Mr. Ryan's secretary.

39
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,738
- I don't think it'd be proper to...
- Would you rather wipe windshields?

40
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,443
All right.

41
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,080
Kyle and I flew in
from Texas this afternoon.

42
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,844
- Sounds urgent.
- Very.

43
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,319
- Kyle said he felt like a steak sandwich.
- Steak sandwich?

44
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,890
And who serves the best
steak sandwich in the world?

45
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,687
- 21?
- Simple, isn't it?

46
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,129
Or should I say
simpleminded?

47
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,931
1,380 miles for a...

48
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:42,003
- Then you were fooling me about
a business conference.
- No, that was my idea,

49
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:45,975
you know, in case Mr. Jasper Hadley
should ask why we came to town.

50
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:49,206
Oh, the big boss. Well...

51
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,307
Cheer up. You might
get your picture in the paper.

52
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,579
Is that all you live for?

53
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,054
- Guess again, Miss Moore.
- I'm sorry.

54
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,560
I just wanted you to understand
how I feel about such things.

55
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,797
- Know something?
- What?

56
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,799
Maybe we're two of a kind.

57
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:15,799
Harry, put it on my tab.

58
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,810
- Of course, Mr. Hadley.
- Who's this friend we're waiting for?

59
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,709
Mitch Wayne, my sidekick.

60
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,146
Mmm, where do his millions
come from?

61
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,581
He's eccentric...
he's poor.

62
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:30,246
- I'll bet.
- Honey, you would lose.

63
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:35,259
Mitch is just a country boy. The kind of assets
he's got you can't buy with money.

64
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:40,458
Sorry, kids.
I'll have to make this some other time.

65
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,593
- He's not eccentric.
- No, he's as rich as Rockefeller.

66
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:47,672
- Hello, I'm Kyle Hadley.
- I'm Lucy Moore.

67
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:51,209
Lucy Moore.
Your taste is improving.

68
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,279
Miss Moore is Bill Ryan's
new executive secretary.

69
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,679
A member of the happy, happy
Hadley Industrial family.

70
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,585
This is sure cozy.

71
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,289
There are rare moments when only
champagne will do. This is one of them.

72
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,001
Like the lyrics say,
"Are you from Dixie or where?"

73
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,833
Indiana. Small town
you probably never heard of.

74
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,100
Any time you ask me,
I'll put it on the map.

75
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,540
What shows
in your crystal ball?

76
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:28,943
Oh, I'll probably walk down an aisle
and wind up in a suburb...

77
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,484
- ... with a husband, mortgage and children.
- That's not for you.

78
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:36,111
- Why not?
- Got too much beauty and brains
to fall into a trap like that.

79
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,587
Just what sort of trap
do you suggest?

80
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,558
How would you like to join the Kyle Hadley
Society for the Prevention of Boredom?

81
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:45,960
What would my duties be?
- Not duties.

82
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,967
Pleasures, such as Kyle Hadley's
guided tour through the gossip columns,

83
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,230
around the world
in 80 headlines.

84
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:56,205
- I'm afraid that'd bore me.
- What wouldn't bore you?

85
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,208
My career... advertising.

86
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,143
Bravo...
as they say in Texas.

87
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,976
- Where did you learn the advertising game?
- With the Sheraton Agency.

88
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,747
- Top drawer?
- One of Madison Avenue's finest.

89
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,754
Good enough.

90
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:12,756
I'll buy you the agency.

91
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,927
What if I took you up on that?

92
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,259
A phone, please.

93
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,264
Yes, Mr. Hadley.

94
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:25,700
- You're really serious, aren't you?
- Sure I am.

95
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:28,773
- What's the number?
- The agency or my apartment?

96
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:32,071
- Seriously...
- Very seriously, forget it.

97
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,081
I'm only following the advice of a Texas
philosopher who said, "Give the little girl a big..."

98
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:42,449
I think it's time we heard from another county.
What do you do for the Hadley Oil Company?

99
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:45,751
We're troubleshooters.
Wherever they want trouble, they send for us.

100
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,590
I, uh, have a sheep skin
that says I'm a geologist.

101
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,756
- That adds up.
- I was kicked out of the same school.

102
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,494
They found rocks
in my head.

103
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,968
Shouldn't you be going back
to the office?

104
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,039
Apparently,
I never should have left.

105
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,042
- We haven't finished our champagne.
- Remarkable, isn't it?

106
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,251
I think we need cigarettes.
Get a carton.

107
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,584
We'll get a cab, meanwhile.

108
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:19,589
Thank you, Mr. Hadley.

109
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,153
Carton of Mullhall, please.

110
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,566
Thank you.

111
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,876
Don't look now,
but you've dropped your friend.

112
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:46,781
You advertising people...
so clever with words.

113
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,650
Guess I've fallen
from your grace.

114
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,658
Does it really matter?

115
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,453
Change your course.
Teterborough Airport.

116
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,125
Look, if you don't mind, I'd like to get off
the merry-go-round.

117
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,498
I can't quit now.

118
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,367
I want you to meet
another fellow... a real one.

119
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,006
- Some other time, perhaps.
- Some times, like now,

120
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,373
I can get you
in the terminal.

121
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,810
I want us to be friends
when we say good-bye.

122
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,075
Well, then let me
give you a tip.

123
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:22,745
- Drop me at the office.
- And if I do, I lose you.

124
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,553
Look, Lucy, once we're up in the blue,
I'm a different fellow...

125
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,356
a lot different
from this character.

126
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:36,929
All right.
Maybe I should meet him.

127
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,536
No stunts now, like buzzing
the Empire State Building.

128
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,635
The only stunts I do
are in nightclubs.

129
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,645
May I ask why?

130
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:51,648
I wouldn't admit this
to anyone but you,

131
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,650
but I drink too much.

132
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:11,268
- Here's your change.
- Can't shake you, can I?

133
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,270
Goes both ways.

134
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,908
Am I safe in this crate?

135
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:24,312
I guess so. The tanks are loaded, and
the pilot isn't, for a change.

136
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,316
Lucy.

137
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,201
You know, I've seen you before...
at the office.

138
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,334
- A fleeting glance, wasn't it?
- How much did you contribute?

139
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:55,572
Enough.
How long have you known Mitch?

140
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,241
My dad introduced us
when we started the first grade.

141
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,411
- That must have been before
your father struck oil.
- Dad was worth 100 million then.

142
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:07,049
He had no use for private schools, and
he wanted me to grow up with Mitch.

143
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,491
Why Mitch in particular?

144
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:13,496
Mitch's old man is my dad's boyhood pal...
his idol, I guess.

145
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:16,294
A small rancher...
kind of a legend in our county.

146
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:19,302
Great hunter, sort of
a throwback to Daniel Boone.

147
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,831
I used to wish
he was my father.

148
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,406
Is your father aware of this?

149
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:34,008
Dad's a big man... so big that he and I know
I can't fit his shoes, or even come close.

150
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,986
- Can anybody?
- Yes.

151
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,023
Mitch.

152
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,928
When I was kicked out of college,
Dad gave up hoping...

153
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,267
Mitch's qualities
might rub off on me.

154
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,207
It's easy to talk like this when you're 6,000
feet above the big poker table.

155
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,269
- Poker table?
- Sure. The big one... from Maine to California.

156
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,710
Down there, I'm a guy
with too many chips.

157
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:10,049
I throw 'em up in the air,
and a few land on my shoulders.

158
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:14,387
They'd be disappointed if I didn't behave like
a playboy... didn't end up like my uncle.

159
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,394
- How did he end up?
- Joe Hadley?

160
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,396
Lived hard and he died hard.

161
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,831
He survived a few duels over some European
duchesses and countesses,

162
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:27,303
only to be done in by a jealous Turk who hired
assassins to cut out his heart.

163
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,670
- He was only 30.
- Black sheep?

164
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,370
- One of three.
- Well, I take it you include yourself,

165
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,378
but who's the third?

166
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,472
My kid sister Marylee.

167
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:42,019
She's got enough devil in her to put
Uncle Joe and me in the shade.

168
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,520
What's the matter?
Your ears burning?

169
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,750
Just came to tell you
we're off the Carolina coast.

170
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,554
- North Carolina?
- Uh-huh. Are we turning back?

171
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,856
Can't. Automatic pilot's
set for Miami.

172
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:55,660
- And then what?
- I feel like a swim. How does Miami Beach sound?

173
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:58,201
Better ask your guest.

174
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:02,639
Just say the word, and
I'll make a 180-degree turn.

175
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,644
Reluctantly?

176
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,579
Uh-huh. Something
is happening to me.

177
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:15,142
I find myself talking to you like
I never talked to anyone before...

178
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,278
not even Mitch.

179
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:22,452
Please, Lucy. I think we're past
the point of no return.

180
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,932
Flight 498...

181
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,768
now arriving from Havana
at Cubana concourse.

182
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,776
Kyle's probably arranging
to buy you the hotel,

183
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,178
a stretch of the beach
and a slice of the Gulf strip.

184
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:49,815
Why are you so sarcastic?
Do you resent our being here,

185
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:53,857
or are you just disappointed that
I didn't ask Kyle to turn back?

186
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:58,796
The first surprise
came at Teterborough.

187
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,058
I underestimated Kyle's charm.

188
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:06,000
Perhaps you've always
underestimated Kyle.

189
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,368
Or maybe you're
overestimating me.

190
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:12,102
- Could be.
- Nothing like this has ever happened
to me before.

191
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,111
It's an adventure.
It's exciting.

192
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,846
Are you looking for laughs?

193
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,850
Or are you soul searching?

194
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,852
The latter, I guess.

195
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,647
I think I'm beginning
to know Kyle...

196
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,250
and to like him.

197
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,796
Well, in that case, I'm glad.

198
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,833
I really am.

199
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,970
Tell me something.

200
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:45,201
This hooky-playing...
when does it end?

201
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:49,078
I don't know.

202
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,479
For me,
it never seems to end.

203
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,944
Okay, kids.
Let's beat it to Miami Beach.

204
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,455
Found us a boarding house with
built-in black-eyed peas and grits.

205
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,068
This way, please.

206
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm certain, Mr. Hadley, you'll find everything
to your satisfaction.

207
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,812
- Everything?
- Yes, sir.

208
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,813
Nice little boarding house
you have here.

209
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:27,146
This is Miss Moore's suite.

210
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,812
- And we're right across the hall?
- Yes, sir.

211
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:55,439
How do you like it?

212
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,447
What's not to like, huh?

213
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,949
Come on.
I'll show you around.

214
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,537
Anything missing?

215
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,474
Open the closet.

216
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,289
Look over here.

217
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:54,663
Great invention,
the telephone, hmm?

218
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,673
See you in an hour, okay?

219
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,573
Sure floored her, didn't it?

220
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:34,202
- Me too.
- Sounds like a crack.

221
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:37,076
No, just a dent in my armor.

222
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,208
- What does that mean?
- Nothing much.

223
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,522
Except I had Lucy
figured wrong.

224
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,386
What did you expect?

225
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:50,154
I figured she'd be different
than all the rest.

226
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,889
- She is.
- No, she's not.

227
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,735
If she were, she'd have spit
right in your eye.

228
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,545
Lucy?

229
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,522
Lucy, you decent?

230
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,255
Lucy, are you dec...

231
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,541
Guess she was.

232
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:56,120
- Yes, Mr. Hadley?
- Did you see Miss Moore leave?

233
00:19:56,227 --> 00:20:00,391
Yes, sir, I did...
about, uh, 30 minutes ago.

234
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,800
Yes, sir.

235
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,394
- Remember the girl who arrived
with me an hour ago?
- Yes, she left alone.

236
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:10,099
Took a cab to the airport.

237
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,608
The airport.
Please step on it.

238
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,806
Last call.

239
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,908
National Airlines,
flight 46 to New York,

240
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,953
gate number five.

241
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,545
- All aboard.
- Hello, Lucy.

242
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,955
Hello.

243
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,959
Please let me talk to you.

244
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:32,393
I left, didn't I?
Didn't that say enough?

245
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,364
Yes, more than you know.

246
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:39,061
Please give me an hour...
just till the next plane leaves.

247
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:43,367
All right.

248
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,772
Pan American World Airways Clipper,

249
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,936
flight 701...

250
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,174
for Buenos Aires
and intermediate cities...

251
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,978
now boarding
at Pan American concourse.

252
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,691
- Cream?
- Never use it.

253
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,730
Shows how I ittle I know you.

254
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,894
Why'd you run out?

255
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:14,233
I took a sudden dislike
to the suite.

256
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,864
Did I... overdo it?

257
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,502
Oh, it was beautiful
at first glance.

258
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,207
Then I thought how ugly
it would be... in the morning.

259
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,950
You mean, the idea of...
having fun?

260
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,613
Wasn't that your intention?

261
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,623
Guilty as charged.

262
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,626
I was tempted.

263
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,720
Was it easy to overcome?

264
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,163
Yes. You made it easy.

265
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,360
How, by throwing
my money at you?

266
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,199
- No. No, it wasn't that.
- What, then?

267
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,399
It was the ride.

268
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:53,204
"Up in the blue,"
as you call it.

269
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,836
Talked too much,
didn't I?

270
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,745
No. It was good talk.

271
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,081
Only... something happened
to me...

272
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:06,748
something unexpected
as the things you told me.

273
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:10,453
I tried to tell myself
it was, I don't know,

274
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:13,394
sympathy, compassion.

275
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,398
But it was more.

276
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,999
Let's...
let's get out ofhere.

277
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:27,343
Cigarette?

278
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,244
We'll put you on the next plane
to New York.

279
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,253
Thank you.

280
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,389
I'm sorry, Lucy...

281
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:44,655
sorrier than I've even been
in my whole sorry life.

282
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,562
I hope you believe me.

283
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,794
- Is it important that I do?
- Very,

284
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,996
because I...

285
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:57,040
I want to start
all over again... with you.

286
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:01,138
How?

287
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:03,145
Suppose...

288
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:07,080
Just suppose I came
to New York again.

289
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,916
Not to play,
but to work, to behave like...

290
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,456
like Tom, Dick and Harry.

291
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,719
L- I'd ask you for dates,

292
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,796
take you to lunches,
to the movies.

293
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:22,457
I'd be... happy
with a good night kiss.

294
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:28,571
I'd think seriously about all
the things I used to laugh at,

295
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,609
like having a wife
and a home...

296
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,611
and kids.

297
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:42,216
Right now there's one thing
you don't have to suppose.

298
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:45,788
I'm in love with you.

299
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:51,323
So much so that...
I want to marry you.

300
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,545
- Mitch Wayne?
- Yeah.

301
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,121
Jack Williams, Miami Press.

302
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:21,248
- Uh, care to say a few words about the wedding?
- What wedding?

303
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,989
We know that Judge Ross issued a marriage
license this morning to Kyle Hadley...

304
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,088
and, uh, Lucy Moore.

305
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,429
- So what?
- Who is Lucy Moore?

306
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,435
- That's a good question.
- You don't know her?

307
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,301
- Not very well.
- What is she? A show girl, model, what?

308
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,931
Just a girl... a lady.

309
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,707
- A beautiful lady.
- I got news for you, Mr. Wayne.

310
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,714
Your torch is burnin'.

311
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:50,487
- Wedding took place two hours ago.
- Yeah? Where?

312
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:55,017
- Right under my nose. St. Mark's Church.
- Oh.

313
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,117
St. Mark's Church.

314
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:00,994
Uh, Mr. Wayne.
Hey, now wait up, Mr. Wayne.

315
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,797
- Pull up a chair.
- Thank you, sir.

316
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:48,004
- How does it look to you?
- Promising.

317
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,005
How much
would you gamble on it?

318
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,575
I thinkwe ought to go
15,000 feet.

319
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:57,147
What do you hearfrom Kyle?

320
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,649
The gossip columns say
they're in Acapulco.

321
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,914
When do you think I'm going to
get a chance to kiss the bride?

322
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,819
Six months from now? Ayear?

323
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:10,826
- It's only been five weeks.
- Is that all?

324
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,522
It's about time you got hitched,
isn't it?

325
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:20,398
No, I... I have trouble enough
finding oil.

326
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,536
I sure wish you felt different
about Marylee.

327
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,216
We grew up together,
like brother and sister.

328
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:35,751
I just can't see it
any other way.

329
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,753
Yeah.

330
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:40,551
It's a shame, though,
in a way.

331
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,024
It's a real shame.

332
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:46,221
- All right. 5,000 feet. No more.
- Okay.

333
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,733
- Hi.
- Hi!

334
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,430
Mitch. Mr. Hadley,
meet Mrs. Hadley.

335
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:57,006
Welcome to Hadley...

336
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,633
the town and the family.

337
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,905
Thank you.

338
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,414
Well, son, I...
I just couldn't be happier.

339
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:07,416
- Did all right, didn't I?
- You sure did.

340
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:11,113
Nowyou vamoose for a few minutes.
I want to talk to my daughter-in-law alone.

341
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,452
Sure, Dad.
I'll be in Mitch's office.

342
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,088
- Would you like a soft drink?
- No, thanks.

343
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:21,630
Just had one
in the drugstore.

344
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:25,259
- Have you been out to the house?
- Yes, it's beautiful!

345
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,337
And it's home.

346
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:29,963
- Did you meet Marylee?
- No, she was out.

347
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:34,568
Oh, that's too bad. L- I know she's gonna
like you just as much as I do.

348
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,614
I was afraid you might
be wary of me...

349
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,582
that, perhaps, you'd regard me
as a gold digger.

350
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,245
Now, look.
I'm gonna be honest with you.

351
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,482
That's just what I figured,
until I talked to Mitch.

352
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,861
Mitch? Interesting.

353
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,861
Yeah. I wasn't easy
to convince,

354
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:55,591
but Mitch sold me.

355
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,999
In other words, you trust Mitch's judgment
more than Kyle's.

356
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:02,664
Well, I wouldn't put it
that way.

357
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:07,911
- May I ask you a favor?
- Anything at all.

358
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:12,449
Please give Kyle a chance.
You may have to change your opinion ofhim.

359
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,916
How much liquor
has he been puttin' away?

360
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,954
I haven't seen him drunk yet.

361
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,724
Does he still...

362
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,526
Well,

363
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:28,331
I better not ask about that.

364
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,692
You mean, about the pistol
he keeps under his pillow.

365
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:39,602
- You know.
- Yes.

366
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,202
I know all about his anxieties
and fears.

367
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,680
You can forget
about the pistol.

368
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:49,844
Kyle threw it in the ocean.

369
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,557
- I tell you, I'm still up on cloud seven.
- And sober too.

370
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:57,593
Yep, even in Mexico. Remember how I used
to go on those Tequila jags?

371
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,789
How could I forget?

372
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,331
- Yeah?
- A Mr. Willis calling. He says it's urgent.

373
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,496
Okay, put him on.
Dan Willis.

374
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,131
- Mitch.
- What is it, Dan?

375
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:16,206
The Hadley gal's here
with Roy Carter.

376
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,338
Thanks, Dan.
I'll be right over.

377
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,849
- You got a gun here?
- Stay here. I'll handle it.

378
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:24,682
Dan said the Hadley gal.
I'm the Hadley boy, remember?

379
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,927
That's a hot one, ain't it?

380
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:33,656
Notvery.
I've heard better.

381
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,559
What's the matter, honey?
Are you insulted?

382
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:39,568
Not yet.

383
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:43,305
Just bored.

384
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,533
The afternoon's wasting away.

385
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,314
I'll be right back.

386
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:00,387
How's the chances
of some privacy?

387
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:04,393
Are you crazy, Roy?
If old man Hadley ever found out,

388
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,987
he'd have you sent so far away, it'd take
ten years for a telegram to reach you.

389
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:11,727
- Give me the key.
- Forget it. You're stepping out of your class.

390
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,237
You wouldn't like to have this joint of
yours catch fire some night, would you?

391
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,602
Give me a couple of minutes
to clean up.

392
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:28,083
Don't overdo it.

393
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:25,500
If I ever catch you
with my sister again, I'll...

394
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:30,273
- Where do you want her to play, in a sandbox?
- Honeymoon over?

395
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,612
Are you forgetting where you are
and who you're with?

396
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,811
Oh, be polite.
Answer the lady.

397
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,821
Tell us all about...

398
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,889
Marylee, come on.
We're getting out ofhere.

399
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,519
Wait outside, Marylee.

400
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,566
- Step aside, Wayne, before I cut you.
- I would like to see that.

401
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:28,432
Hold it, Roy.

402
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,565
You bigmouth beer slinger.
You phoned Wayne, didn't you?

403
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:34,405
This gun's got a hair trigger.

404
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,479
Okay.

405
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,250
So I'm persuaded.

406
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,286
- Some other time, huh?
- You've had it.

407
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:21,353
- You take Kyle and get out ofhere.
- Thank you, Sir Galahad.

408
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,256
You do care about me,
don't you?

409
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,121
- Let me have the gun, Dan.
- Forget it.

410
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:34,069
Forget it.

411
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,745
I'll kill him.

412
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:46,407
A whiskey bottle's
about all you'd ever kill.

413
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,828
Sorry, Dan.

414
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:39,361
Mitch, let's go down to the river,
to our old haunt.

415
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,032
We used to be happy there.

416
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:48,544
Our own private world...
mine and yours...

417
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,545
and Kyle's.

418
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,850
Then you grew up and left me...

419
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,078
you and Kyle...

420
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,086
the rover boys.

421
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,158
I guess that's why
I hate him so...

422
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,292
for taking you away...

423
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:10,298
from me.

424
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,900
I love you, Mitch.

425
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,941
I'm desperate for you.

426
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,837
So desperate, I run
to the likes of Roy Carter.

427
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,183
All right, blame me.

428
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:35,752
I'm not talking about blame.
About love.

429
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,762
Do you love me, Mitch?

430
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,764
Like a brother.

431
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,596
I don't want you
as a brother.

432
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:49,137
Can't be any other way,
Marylee.

433
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:56,610
Don't... Please don't waste your life
waiting for me.

434
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,315
I'll wait,

435
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:08,050
and I'll have you,

436
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:10,058
marriage...

437
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,562
or no marriage.

438
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:26,099
I'm Marylee.
Welcome to Hadley, Sister-In-Law.

439
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,508
Thank you.
Nice of you to come in and greet me.

440
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:31,012
Oh, please.
I'm allergic to politeness.

441
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:35,278
By the way, your darling husband should
be taught to mind his own business.

442
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:37,819
Should I apologize for him?

443
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:42,324
You should have seen him...
on the wrong end of every punch.

444
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,519
And on thewrong end of town.

445
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:49,795
It isn't 21, but...
it can be exciting.

446
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,300
What do you think of Mitch?

447
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:54,927
You changed the subject.

448
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:58,303
Oh, there's a man for you...
or for me, rather.

449
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:01,434
Kyle starts something,
Mitch finishes it for him.

450
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,945
Kyle falls on his face,
Mitch picks him up.

451
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,481
Kyle steals,
Mitch takes the blame.

452
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:10,451
And there you have
the secret story of Kyle Hadley...

453
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,284
and his electric personality.

454
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,223
I've heard it
from Kyle himself.

455
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:20,194
Anyway, about your marriage,

456
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:23,323
you have my condolences.

457
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:27,335
Pardon me if, uh, I seem to be
brushing you out of my hair.

458
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:37,438
Darling, I'll send you some of my towels.
I believe you're still wet behind the ears.

459
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:51,717
What was the matter
with you today, son?

460
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:54,490
You were supposed to be
huntin', not broodin'.

461
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,089
I'm sorry, Dad.

462
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,740
Sit. Sit!

463
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,004
Anything we can talk about?

464
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:14,209
- Did you ever hear of Iran?
- Africa? Asia? Asia, I guess.

465
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,549
- What about it?
- I'm thinking of going there.

466
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:20,020
- For Hadley?
- No.

467
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,148
Trans American Oil.

468
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:26,525
- Got a bellyful of the Hadleys?
- I guess so.

469
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,564
I sometimes wonder
ifl did right by you...

470
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,690
puttin' you with Jasper
and his kids.

471
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:34,965
Meant it all forthe best... wanted you to have
the chance I had and didn't take.

472
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:39,168
I better level with you, Dad,
about why I'm leavin'.

473
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,807
I'm in love with a woman
that happens to be Kyle's wife.

474
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:48,007
- Is she in love with you?
- No.

475
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:50,018
Strictly one-sided.

476
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:16,307
Bet you can't throw that far, Mitch.

477
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:19,143
Mitch can do everything
better than you, Kyle.

478
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:22,548
Shut up, Marylee.
- Throw it, Mitch.

479
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,950
You did it, Mitch!

480
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,923
Last one across is a rotten egg.

481
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:44,173
Hey, what's that purple stuff
on your lips?

482
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:48,472
Mulberry juice.
Looks like lipstick, doesn't it?

483
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:51,206
Yeah, sure does.

484
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:54,010
Mitch, am I beautiful?

485
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:56,950
- Uh-huh.
- Do you love me?

486
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,614
Sure. You're my girl.

487
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,784
When we grow up,
you'll marry me, won't you, Mitch?

488
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,294
I love you so much.

489
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:40,354
I t's gonna be a great football game.
Could put us in the Cotton Bowl.

490
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,898
Putting me in Dallas
is what I like about it.

491
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:45,593
I never know who's got the ball.

492
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:18,024
A drink...
for your thoughts.

493
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,434
Congratulate me.
I've just been voted the life of the party.

494
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:29,469
Your old room.

495
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,379
All those wonderful afternoons
we used to spend here.

496
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,886
And it rained.

497
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:42,516
Well, it was too cold for us
to go down to the river haunt.

498
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,819
Yes, those wonderful
lost afternoons.

499
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,242
That's a nice dress...
real flattering.

500
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:07,646
I've changed since we
last swam in the raw, haven't I?

501
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,681
A long, long time ago.

502
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,950
I was an idiot boy then.

503
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:16,958
Yes, you were.

504
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:23,262
The other idiot boy's downstairs
having himself a big party.

505
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,035
It's a happy occasion, isn't it?

506
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,333
Unbelievable.

507
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,705
Married a whole year
and still sober...

508
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,710
and still faithful.

509
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:38,781
It can't last much longer.

510
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:42,717
Don't sell Lucy short.

511
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:46,482
There's only so much
a woman can do, and no more.

512
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:52,626
I speak from...
personal experience...

513
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:54,629
with you.

514
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:58,462
You know,
you're remarkable.

515
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:03,267
You've got your axe buried in Kyle's head,
and you're grinding it at the same time.

516
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:07,776
- I can think of much better
things than making small talk.
- Oh.

517
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,714
All right. Let's dance.

518
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,081
Still the idiot boy.

519
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:28,755
Oh, thank you, Dad!

520
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:33,969
Oh, it's beautiful.

521
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,970
Thank you, Lucy.

522
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:38,836
What about the poor struggling husband?
Don't I get anything?

523
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,070
- Well, what more do you want, son?
- Another big party.

524
00:44:42,178 --> 00:44:44,772
Only next time,
we'll invite the stork.

525
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:45,403
- Beats prescription liquor, doesn't it, Doc?
- It sure does.

526
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:47,738
Just a second, Doc, please.

527
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:51,143
- Do me a favor.
- Just name it.

528
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,374
Ask Lucy to pay you a visit.

529
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:59,284
- She's been visiting me regularly.
- She has?

530
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:03,416
Look, why don't we have a powwow in my office
about 10:00 in the morning?

531
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:05,858
It won't keep.

532
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:08,954
Tell me, is, is Lucy all right?

533
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:15,027
Well, what I mean is...
can she have children?

534
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:18,232
- Tomorrow we'll sit down and...
- Now, Doc.

535
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:20,241
Please.

536
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,872
There's nothing wrong with Lucy.

537
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,214
Well, your wife's
a wonderful dancer.

538
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:11,082
Kyle, what's the matter?

539
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:13,958
- Come on. Dance with me.
- Can't.

540
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:17,794
Somebody just stole my...
magic dancing slippers.

541
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,592
Anyone for lunch?

542
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:49,121
Don't tell me where.
I'll find my way.

543
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:53,794
Glory be. Maybe you finally
see the light in my eyes.

544
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:16,190
Oh, there's nothing
like a picnic,

545
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:19,261
and I've brought everything
but rain and ants.

546
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:22,525
Oh, correction.
Everything but rain.

547
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:25,066
Anything happen at the house
after I left the party?

548
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,295
Didn't miss a thing,

549
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:30,304
except the sight of me
sleeping in your old room.

550
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:33,568
Did Kyle have a spat
with Lucy?

551
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:39,011
That's why you gave in and came here with me...
to play 20 questions.

552
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:41,015
Well, did he or didn't he?

553
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:45,247
I don't know. All I know is he bit
my head off this morning.

554
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,255
Why?
What'd you say to him?

555
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:51,851
That he looked sick. All I said was,
"I trust it's nothing trivial."

556
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:55,158
- Do you...
- Oh, please. No more questions.

557
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,202
Let's eat,

558
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:03,033
drink and be merry.

559
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,705
We'll eat, drink and run.

560
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,075
If Lucy were here with you,
I bet you wouldn't say that.

561
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,081
I once washed your mouth out
with soap. I can do it again.

562
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:16,083
I knowyou, Mitch.

563
00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:18,676
No one will ever know you
as I knowyou.

564
00:49:22,725 --> 00:49:24,625
Good morning, Doctor.

565
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,301
- What's the story?
- I believe we'll have to make
some further tests...

566
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,032
What is it?
Yes or no?

567
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,335
Kyle, it's not that simple.

568
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:42,104
No apologies. Facts.

569
00:49:42,211 --> 00:49:45,374
- What'll you have, Doctor?
- Oh, just a limeade, Sherry. No ice.

570
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:48,006
Yes, Doctor.

571
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:50,051
The tests we took show a...

572
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,054
Well, let's call it a weakness.

573
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,856
Believe me,
you're not sterile.

574
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:03,723
And there is hope, real hope,
that, in time,

575
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,233
we'll be able to correct
that weakness.

576
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,362
- Hello?
- Marylee, it's Mitch.

577
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,703
Oh, yes. Brother Mitch.

578
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:48,504
Kyle just phoned me.
He wants us, you and me,

579
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,079
to join him and Lucy
at the country club for dinner.

580
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,580
Look, I'll pick you up
at 6:00, okay?

581
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:57,710
Don't bother, Mitch, not unless you have
an exciting evening in mind.

582
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,153
And you know exactly what I mean
by an exciting evening.

583
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:38,287
- Good evenin'. Fill her up?
- Yes.

584
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,330
You're Biff Miley, aren't you?

585
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,526
Nice of you to recognize me
without my shoulder pads.

586
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,728
Your number's
in my program.

587
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:50,670
I recognized you too,
Miss Hadley.

588
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:53,901
You do?
What do we do now?

589
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,638
Break into a chorus
of "Hail, Alma Mater"?

590
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,950
I close up
in half an hour.

591
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,880
You mean, usually.

592
00:52:05,988 --> 00:52:09,321
All right.
Just keep the motor running.

593
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,296
- Good evening, Jack. Is Mr. Hadley here yet?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

594
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,602
Hello, Lucy.
What's up?

595
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:28,802
I was hoping
you could tell me.

596
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:31,379
I haven't seen Kyle since
he left the house this morning.

597
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,609
He phoned me about an hour ago and said
we were having dinner at the club.

598
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:36,617
Well, he phoned me too.

599
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,488
Kyle.

600
00:52:46,662 --> 00:52:48,562
Howdy.

601
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:52,399
Good evening, Mrs. Hadley,
Mr. Wayne.

602
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,732
Good evening.

603
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:57,362
- Set 'em up, Ben.
- Yes, sir.

604
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:03,370
- Where's little sister?
- Couldn't locate her.

605
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:06,937
She'll never, never be missed.

606
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:10,450
- Will she, honey?
- Will she what?

607
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:15,616
Be missed. Haven't you learned to hate
Marylee as much as I do?

608
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,093
A toast to...

609
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:25,233
to beauty...

610
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:29,270
and the truth,
which is anything but beautiful.

611
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:35,809
Come on.
Let's have some dinner.

612
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:39,609
Honey, this is an occasion.

613
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:44,345
We must proceed with,
with quiet dignity.

614
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:47,854
What, um...
what are we celebrating?

615
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:50,585
The end of a drought...

616
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:52,661
a year long drought.

617
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,663
We drank a toast to truth.

618
00:53:55,765 --> 00:54:00,031
- So?
- You ought to let us in on what
you're really celebrating...

619
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,036
or mourning.

620
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,007
- Ben, quick. The potions.
- Yes, sir.

621
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,105
So you'd like to know
my secret.

622
00:54:12,915 --> 00:54:16,646
The secret is...

623
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:21,655
not to pour the vermouth, just
to pretend you're pouring it.

624
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:45,145
Those lousy cops again.

625
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:56,057
I'm sorry, Ralph.
I didn't mean to blow up like that,

626
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,788
but I'm getting a little sick and tired
of your efficiency experts.

627
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:03,161
They ought to get off their chairs
and out in the field for a change.

628
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:09,804
All right, Ralph. I'll see you in New York
Thursday morning. Bye.

629
00:55:33,462 --> 00:55:36,363
I thought I'd seen
the last of this.

630
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:40,162
I wish I could,
but I can't explain it.

631
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:43,568
- Where have you been?
- The country club.

632
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,905
- Did you have a spat?
- No.

633
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,706
Nothing as simple as that.

634
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:55,841
We let him drink, hoping he'd talk
and tell us what was on his mind.

635
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,220
Butwe learned nothing,

636
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:04,123
except that
he's terribly tormented.

637
00:56:04,226 --> 00:56:06,558
What are you
going to do now?

638
00:56:08,197 --> 00:56:11,724
Go to him and try to help him.

639
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:29,376
Kid. Kid stuff, Mitch.

640
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:36,489
I want to buy a new car,
the first flashy car.

641
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:39,891
To hell with college.
I wanna have fun...

642
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,863
with some girls.

643
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,933
Nice overin Dallas.

644
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,934
To hell with college.

645
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,603
Wanna make some money, Mitch?

646
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:57,941
Over at the bottling plant.
Old man Daley's place.

647
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:02,484
No, I haven't got any bottles.
Old man Daley has.

648
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:11,051
Don't touch me.
Touch me, I'll tell my father.

649
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,256
That's what I'll do.
My father.

650
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:18,265
We weren't stealing,
were we, Mitch?

651
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:21,928
We were just stacking
some bottles up for you.

652
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,802
That's all we were doing,
wasn't it, Mitch?

653
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:27,774
Mitch? Mitch.

654
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:31,074
Wait forme.
Wait forme!

655
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:35,617
I remember I stopped the surgeon just
before he went in to operate.

656
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:39,552
I said, "Doctor, I'll write
a check for a million dollars,

657
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:42,818
but just don't let my wife die."

658
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,825
But I failed.

659
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:57,572
I failed them all...

660
00:57:57,673 --> 00:57:59,607
my wife
and my brotherJoe.

661
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:03,405
Both my children.

662
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:05,912
I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

663
00:58:56,398 --> 00:58:59,162
Where did you first meet
my daughter?

664
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:03,068
I never met her before, not till
she picked me up tonight.

665
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:06,300
- She picked you up?
- Sure.

666
00:59:06,408 --> 00:59:10,344
- That's how she operates.
- What do you mean, "operates"?

667
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,006
I never heard of anybody
pickin' her up. That's all.

668
00:59:13,115 --> 00:59:15,015
It's always
the other way around.

669
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:17,517
How would you know?

670
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,556
Why don't you just walk up and down
Main Street and ask somebody?

671
00:59:21,657 --> 00:59:23,557
I'm asking you!

672
00:59:25,127 --> 00:59:27,493
Look, I don't like
to shoot my mouth off.

673
00:59:27,596 --> 00:59:29,496
I also don't like
being on the carpet.

674
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:31,998
I didn't take her to the motel.
She took me.

675
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:37,004
Your daughter's a tramp, mister.
If that ain't plain enough, I could put...

676
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,550
- Get him out ofhere.
- Should we hold him?

677
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,680
No. Let him go.

678
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,793
Keep it quiet, if you can.

679
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:03,725
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

680
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:05,312
- Kyle?
- Hmm?

681
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,314
When is it going to end?

682
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:11,381
You never know.

683
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,820
Things have a way
ofhappening so suddenly,

684
01:03:14,923 --> 01:03:16,823
unexpectedly.

685
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:19,519
- What's wrong?
- What isn't?

686
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:22,153
Me and my darling sister...

687
01:03:23,265 --> 01:03:25,529
we pushed Dad
down the stairs.

688
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,397
You started drinking
before your father died.

689
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,565
Yeah,
I was 14 years old.

690
01:03:34,676 --> 01:03:37,270
- Kyle.
- Hmm?

691
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,909
Do you love me?

692
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:42,916
Love you?

693
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:46,483
I don't even love myself.

694
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:52,517
Kyle, what is it?
Is it something I've said...

695
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:57,292
or something I've done
or should have done?

696
01:03:57,399 --> 01:04:00,300
I can't tell you.

697
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,893
I'm afraid.

698
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,805
It's like I was deep
in a mountain pass,

699
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:10,208
snowcaps hanging
over my head.

700
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:12,473
If I make a sound,

701
01:04:12,581 --> 01:04:14,981
snow might all come
tumbling down.

702
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:20,350
Bury me... alive.

703
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,757
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lucy.

704
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:07,995
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, thanks.

705
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,944
You look ill.

706
01:05:25,053 --> 01:05:27,214
It's been a long week.

707
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,347
Yeah.

708
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,859
About time for me
to clear out.

709
01:05:36,231 --> 01:05:38,893
Bored?

710
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,901
Disgusted.

711
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,471
Mostly with myself.

712
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,702
But I...

713
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,108
I need you here.

714
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,808
That's the only reason
I stayed... to help you.

715
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:59,316
Not Kyle?

716
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,384
I made a resolution last week.

717
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,585
It goes like this:

718
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:07,594
To hell with the Hadleys.

719
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:13,057
I'm a Hadley.

720
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:15,534
Not to me, you're not.

721
01:06:15,637 --> 01:06:18,538
- I respect my marriage.
- Haven't I?

722
01:06:30,285 --> 01:06:32,344
Where are you going?

723
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:35,989
Going to see my dad. Why?

724
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,485
Would you drop me off
in town?

725
01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:46,199
What's the matter
with your car?

726
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,505
Nothing.

727
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,775
All right.

728
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,805
That was no lady.
That was your wife.

729
01:07:24,906 --> 01:07:27,773
Where are they going?

730
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,606
I don't know.

731
01:07:30,712 --> 01:07:33,510
Where would you take
your best friend's wife?

732
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:37,084
You're a real sweet kid.

733
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:39,380
Now be nice to me, brother.

734
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,582
One morning we'll wake up,
and we'll be all alone together.

735
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:46,388
Go on, sister.
Tell me another pretty story.

736
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:50,761
- Once upon a time, there was
a poor little rich boy.
- Kyle Hadley, by name.

737
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:54,324
- Who pickled his tiny brain with gin and bourbon.
- Not so. Scotch.

738
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:59,874
Till he got so stinking blind, he couldn't see
what was going on right under his big red nose.

739
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,739
But his charming, righteous
little sister did.

740
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:04,744
Yes.

741
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,844
She saw the end
of a marriage...

742
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:11,350
and the beginning
of a love affair.

743
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,960
You're a filthy liar.

744
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:25,198
I'm filthy... period.

745
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:31,867
But you don't have to take
my word for anything.

746
01:08:31,973 --> 01:08:35,875
Just try keeping your head clear
and your eyes open.

747
01:08:35,977 --> 01:08:39,538
Why should you care?
You've never cared about me.

748
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:43,414
- Or your wife.
- Why are you putting your two cents in?

749
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:46,419
Only because of Mitch.

750
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,853
Because I've never had him,

751
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:50,857
and your wife has.

752
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:15,644
Will you pick me up at the drugstore
in about an hour, please?

753
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:17,651
Better take a taxi.

754
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:23,116
Am I that much trouble to you?

755
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:26,626
You don't know how much.

756
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,965
I'll be waiting for you.

757
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,809
When you figurin' on leavin'?

758
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:52,944
Monday morning.

759
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,127
Flying all the way to Iran?

760
01:09:59,227 --> 01:10:01,889
No, I'm gonna take a tanker
out of Baltimore.

761
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:07,291
Places don't seem so far away
if you take a plane.

762
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:09,893
Used to feel that way
about motor cars.

763
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,807
What'd Kyle have to say?

764
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:18,710
Nothin'.
Haven't told him yet.

765
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,374
I'm waiting for him
to sober up.

766
01:10:23,418 --> 01:10:26,182
How's Kyle's wife?

767
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,018
Goin' through hell.

768
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:32,116
Did she ever find out
just howyou feel about her?

769
01:10:34,062 --> 01:10:37,156
Yeah. I about told her
this morning.

770
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:41,999
How strong does she feel
about you?

771
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:45,605
I don't know.

772
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:48,175
In about another hour or so,
I'm gonna find out.

773
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:02,956
The car's over here.

774
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,788
Stopped at the gun shop.

775
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:08,795
Picked out a rifle
for my dad...

776
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,797
for Christmas.

777
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,467
What's the matter?

778
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,101
Well, I'll tell you
what's the matter with me.

779
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,267
I'm leaving for Iran
next week.

780
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:24,311
Trans American Oil.

781
01:11:24,412 --> 01:11:26,880
I can't keep holding back
how I feel about you, Lucy...

782
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,917
how I've felt ever since
the first day we met.

783
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,117
I'm in love with you.

784
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:40,351
No. L-I have
to tell you something.

785
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,865
- I've found out why Kyle's
been drinking so heavily.
- Forget Kyle.

786
01:11:44,966 --> 01:11:48,561
- I'm talking about you and me.
- Mitch, you've got to listen to me, please.

787
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:53,607
You know how much Kyle's always talked about
having children... how badly he's wanted them.

788
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:56,871
Dr. Cochrane told him
he might never have any.

789
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,574
Poor guy.

790
01:12:01,683 --> 01:12:05,983
Mitch, it was a medical opinion,
not a fact.

791
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,929
I'm going to have a baby.

792
01:12:33,915 --> 01:12:36,008
That was for good-bye.

793
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:15,216
Well, it's a beautiful day...

794
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:17,382
for something or other,
isn't it?

795
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:19,756
- What's Kyle doing?
- You mean, right this minute?

796
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:23,490
- Yes.
- Well, right this minute, Kyle's out.

797
01:13:23,598 --> 01:13:26,123
Did he say
where he was going?

798
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:29,169
All I know is he hopped
into his car and he flew.

799
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:31,704
- And I mean flew.
- Was he drunk?

800
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:34,001
If he wasn't,
he was well on his way.

801
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:58,757
You ought to take it
with you.

802
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,097
Well, with you chasing me...

803
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:06,467
Can I level with you, Kyle?

804
01:14:06,574 --> 01:14:09,543
Mr. Hadley to you.

805
01:14:09,644 --> 01:14:11,976
Well, it seems to me,
Mr. Hadley,

806
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,275
if I were one of the richest
men in the world,

807
01:14:14,382 --> 01:14:17,078
I wouldn't be sitting in a place like this
drinking raw corn.

808
01:14:17,185 --> 01:14:21,622
- Whatwould you be doing?
- I'd be at the country club,
drinking bonded bourbon.

809
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:24,283
- Nothin' but.
- I like bootlegged corn better.

810
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:26,792
It's full of memories.

811
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,728
Each swig takes me back,
far back.

812
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:35,133
You know, good ol' days, when a fellow
knew nothing and cared less.

813
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,902
Hello. It's Mitch.

814
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:51,512
No, sir. He ain't here. I haven't seen him since
that last time. You remember.

815
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:54,747
Yeah. Well, buzz me at home
ifhe drops in, will you?

816
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:57,086
Yeah, Mitch.
Surewill. Bye.

817
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,034
Excuse me, sir.

818
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,266
Dinneris served.

819
01:15:13,374 --> 01:15:15,274
Thank you, Sam.

820
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,245
It's rather pleasant here
without Kyle, isn't it?

821
01:15:56,584 --> 01:15:59,485
Well, ifit isn't
SmilingJack himself.

822
01:16:11,432 --> 01:16:15,869
Hark, L-I think I hear the master's kiddie car.
I hope the drawbridge is down.

823
01:16:32,453 --> 01:16:35,422
My, you're a dandy group.

824
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,590
Bring me a cocktail
I can drink.

825
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:47,429
Yes, sir.

826
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:50,800
- I don't mean tomato juice.
- Yes, sir.

827
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:58,912
I suppose you're wondering why
I brought you all here tonight.

828
01:16:59,013 --> 01:17:02,881
Now ifhis lights
would only go out.

829
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:05,748
Kyle, would you please
come upstairs?

830
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:08,981
- You wish to confess?
- Please, Kyle.

831
01:17:14,562 --> 01:17:18,430
- Don't leave the country.
- Please.

832
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,626
Amusing, isn't he?

833
01:17:20,735 --> 01:17:22,635
Very.

834
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:28,264
Let's throw a party.

835
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:30,606
Call up everybody we know.

836
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,714
No party, huh?

837
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:38,445
What do you say to a plane ride?
We'll go to Acapulco.

838
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:40,885
What do you say to Palm Beach?

839
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,651
- We'll decide about it in the morning.
- It'll be fun,

840
01:17:43,758 --> 01:17:45,953
like turning back the clock.

841
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,461
Palm Beach.
I like that.

842
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:52,897
It's got meaning.
It's got signif...

843
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,265
It's got meaning.

844
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,042
Are you sure
your husband's out of town?

845
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:11,517
Sit down, Kyle.

846
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:17,050
You said, "Sit down, Kyle."

847
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:19,456
That means bad news,
doesn't it?

848
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,461
No, it doesn't.
The news couldn't be better.

849
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:29,566
You know howyou look now?

850
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:32,538
Like you did that night
at the Miami Airport,

851
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,666
when I took you
off the plane.

852
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:39,543
Kyle, I went to see
Dr. Cochrane this morning.

853
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:46,249
He told you about me,
didn't he?

854
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:50,352
I said the news was good.

855
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:52,358
What's goodabout it?

856
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:57,760
We're...
we're going to have a baby.

857
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:05,764
You mean, adopt one.

858
01:19:06,974 --> 01:19:11,274
No. No, ourbaby...
yours and mine.

859
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:19,109
No. No.

860
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:23,389
No.

861
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:25,391
Kyle, it's true.

862
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:30,229
You shouldn't
have done that to me.

863
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,299
You shouldn't have.

864
01:19:38,272 --> 01:19:40,240
What are you talking about?

865
01:19:41,876 --> 01:19:43,776
Mitch.

866
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:48,642
You and Mitch.

867
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:52,578
Don't say that, Kyle.
Don't even think it.

868
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,315
What did you think?

869
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,358
You think I was just
a drunken idiot?

870
01:19:58,459 --> 01:20:00,825
That I'd believe you?

871
01:20:00,928 --> 01:20:03,988
That I'dlet you use
myname? Take my money?

872
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:06,623
You all can rot in hell!

873
01:20:06,734 --> 01:20:10,602
- You, Mitch and your little...
- Kyle, I've had nothing to do with Mitch.

874
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,572
You dirty tramp!

875
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:39,157
Mitch.

876
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,377
Get out.

877
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:56,276
Get out before I kill you!

878
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:23,776
He hit me.

879
01:21:40,194 --> 01:21:42,355
Dr. Cochrane, please.

880
01:21:42,463 --> 01:21:44,363
It's very urgent.

881
01:22:05,486 --> 01:22:09,183
She's asleep now.
Give her one of these when she wakes up.

882
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:13,351
- How bad is she?
- She's weak, too weak to move
to the hospital till morning.

883
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,361
She's had a miscarriage.

884
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:22,566
- Good night, Marylee.
- Good night, Doctor.

885
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,746
- Your coat, Doctor.
- Thank you.

886
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:40,379
Mind ifl ask you
an impertinent question?

887
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,513
Kyle had no cause.

888
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:45,820
- Thanks. Where is he now?
- I don't know.

889
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:49,829
He'dbetternot come back here
tonight. I'll tellyou that.

890
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:56,328
Call me if you need me.

891
01:23:22,129 --> 01:23:25,496
- You been in an accident?
- Get me a bottle of corn.

892
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,058
- Maybe you ought to go see a doctor.
- I said a bottle!

893
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:45,551
You know who that is?

894
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,553
Kyle Hadley.

895
01:23:49,323 --> 01:23:51,917
The oil family.

896
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:54,961
Well, what do ya know?
I thought he was a bum.

897
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,400
That's five bucks.

898
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:08,442
- I said five.
- I'm buying something else.

899
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:11,568
- Like what?
- That gun you keep.

900
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,204
Put it in another sack.

901
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:16,215
No sale.

902
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,020
What's with you?

903
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:24,558
- Somebody tried to kill me.
- Who?

904
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:26,559
My best friend.

905
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,067
- What are you doing?
- The liquor's on the house.

906
01:24:36,303 --> 01:24:38,396
I'll give you 100
for the gun.

907
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,531
I got business
to attend to.

908
01:24:40,641 --> 01:24:42,973
Take your courage
and leave me be.

909
01:25:00,494 --> 01:25:02,587
Oh, don't go!

910
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:05,632
- I'm just gonna get you some water.
- Oh, not yet, please.

911
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:09,362
I don't wanna go to sleep yet.
I just want to talk to you.

912
01:25:10,504 --> 01:25:12,904
Take me away, Mitch.

913
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:14,907
Take me out of this house.

914
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:17,500
- I will, in the morning.
- No!

915
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:19,875
No, now. I'm afraid.

916
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,710
I won't leave you.

917
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:29,614
Where is he?

918
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:33,421
I don't know, but wherever he is,
he'd better stay there...

919
01:25:33,527 --> 01:25:35,825
because ifhe comes back here,
I'll settle with him.

920
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:39,297
Oh, no, Mitch. Please.

921
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:16,260
Shut up, woman!

922
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:18,600
There's gonna be a killin'!

923
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,766
- I heard talk! I heard him!
- You heard nothin'.

924
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,196
You lousy white trash.

925
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,936
You no-account,
two-faced dog.

926
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:00,268
I'm gonna watch you cringe.

927
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:03,309
- Then I'm gonna put a bullet in your belly.
- For what, Kyle?

928
01:28:05,012 --> 01:28:07,674
My best friend,

929
01:28:07,781 --> 01:28:10,341
my lifelong pal.

930
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,414
What a laugh!

931
01:28:15,522 --> 01:28:18,457
You crawlin' snake.
You crept in here,

932
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:22,825
sponged off us Hadleys, stole everything
I ever wanted, everything I ever had.

933
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,921
Like what?

934
01:28:25,032 --> 01:28:27,694
You made me small
in my father's eyes.

935
01:28:27,801 --> 01:28:30,463
You made my sister
spit at me.

936
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:32,801
Then...

937
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:34,807
you stole my wife.

938
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:41,377
- I didn't take anything from you.
- Lousy white trash, say a prayer.

939
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,815
You know who you sound like?
Oldman Daley.

940
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:48,480
Remember old man Daley
and the bottles?

941
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:50,784
It was your idea
to steal them.

942
01:28:50,891 --> 01:28:53,587
I couldn't talk you out of it,
so I went along.

943
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:56,663
But when he caught us, he didn't
blame you, he blamed me.

944
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:59,358
And he grabbed me and he
kicked the tar out of me.

945
01:28:59,466 --> 01:29:02,367
I remember him saying,
"This is what Hadley gets...

946
01:29:02,469 --> 01:29:04,835
for letting his boy
play with trash like you."

947
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,499
He had you pegged right.
You are trash!

948
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:11,271
I took the blame for stealing those bottles,
just like I've always taken the blame,

949
01:29:11,378 --> 01:29:13,278
but I'm not gonna take it
for this.

950
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:17,316
Kyle, we've never lied
to each other.

951
01:29:17,418 --> 01:29:21,514
And I'm telling you now,
I never touched Lucy,

952
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:24,352
only because she's your wife.

953
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:27,325
Get this straight.

954
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:29,623
The child would have been yours.

955
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:33,564
Not mine.

956
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:35,567
Yours.

957
01:29:37,037 --> 01:29:39,528
- Lousy white trash!
- Kyle!

958
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,541
Kyle!

959
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,577
Mitch?

960
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:51,242
Yeah?

961
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:53,650
What are we doing here, Mitch?

962
01:29:53,754 --> 01:29:56,018
What are we doing?

963
01:29:57,891 --> 01:30:00,086
Let's go down to the river...

964
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:04,355
where we belong.

965
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:23,180
Operator, rush an ambulance
to the Hadley estate.

966
01:30:27,888 --> 01:30:30,413
I'll be down at the river,

967
01:30:30,524 --> 01:30:32,424
waiting.

968
01:30:33,527 --> 01:30:35,427
Waiting.

969
01:30:52,913 --> 01:30:54,813
I was just thinking.

970
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,054
You know,

971
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:04,317
you threatened to kill Kyle.

972
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:06,450
The servants heard you.

973
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,460
Also Dr. Cochrane...

974
01:31:08,562 --> 01:31:10,462
and Yours Truly.

975
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:14,599
So what?

976
01:31:16,603 --> 01:31:19,538
I could tell the police...

977
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,370
that I sawyou kill
my dear brother.

978
01:31:24,478 --> 01:31:26,378
You could.

979
01:31:30,784 --> 01:31:32,684
On the other hand,

980
01:31:34,354 --> 01:31:36,254
a wife wouldn't...

981
01:31:36,356 --> 01:31:39,484
and couldn't testify
against her own husband.

982
01:31:44,631 --> 01:31:48,067
You know, for a beautiful girl,
you can look real ugly sometimes.

983
01:31:49,903 --> 01:31:52,269
Ask yourself this:

984
01:31:52,372 --> 01:31:54,397
Would I ever be enough for you?

985
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:59,507
I can talk you right into
the state penitentiary.

986
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:04,508
You're sick, Marylee.

987
01:32:04,618 --> 01:32:08,054
Your sickness won't be cured
by marrying me.

988
01:32:09,723 --> 01:32:12,351
Before it's too late,
you'd better face up to yourself.

989
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:17,863
Look how far we've come
from the river.

990
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:45,751
Raise your right hand, please.

991
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:48,487
Do you swear the testimony
you're about to give in this inquest...

992
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:50,927
is the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

993
01:32:51,031 --> 01:32:53,158
- I do.
Dr. Cochrane,

994
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,701
wouldyou tell this inquest
about the threat, please?

995
01:32:57,304 --> 01:33:02,537
When I asked Mr. Wayne
where Kyle Hadley was,

996
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:06,340
he said, "I don't know, but he'd better not
come back here tonight."

997
01:33:06,446 --> 01:33:08,607
Thank you, Doctor.
Next witness.

998
01:33:08,715 --> 01:33:12,412
My wife. She said to me,
"There's gonna be a killin'.

999
01:33:12,519 --> 01:33:17,889
I heard talk. Mr. Mitch said
he's gonna kill Mr. Kyle."

1000
01:33:17,991 --> 01:33:19,891
Thank you.
Next witness.

1001
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:23,394
That's what I heard...

1002
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:27,763
Mr. Mitch yellin'
and sayin' to Mr. Kyle,

1003
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:29,768
"Get out of here!

1004
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,737
Get out
be-before I killyou!"

1005
01:33:32,839 --> 01:33:36,570
- Thank you. Thank you
very much. Next witness.

1006
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:40,272
Well, Kyle looked all beat up.
I said, "What's with you?"

1007
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:43,008
He said,
"Somebody tried to kill me."

1008
01:33:43,116 --> 01:33:46,779
I asked who, and he said,
"My best friend."

1009
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:48,946
Did he mention a name?

1010
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,286
No, he didn't have to.

1011
01:33:51,391 --> 01:33:53,291
Why not?

1012
01:33:53,393 --> 01:33:57,454
Well, everybody knows that Kyle's
best friend was... Mitch Wayne.

1013
01:33:57,564 --> 01:34:01,432
- Thank you, Mr. Willis.
That'll be all. Next witness.

1014
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:06,336
Canyou tell us if, at any time, you heard
Mitch Wayne threaten to killyour husband?

1015
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,499
Mitch Wayne did not kill
my husband.

1016
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:11,669
That wasn't my question.

1017
01:34:11,778 --> 01:34:15,976
I asked you if, at any time, you heard Mitch
Wayne threaten to kill your husband.

1018
01:34:17,684 --> 01:34:20,619
- Yes, but...
- Thank you. That will be all.

1019
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:22,916
Will Miss Hadley
step forward, please?

1020
01:34:29,663 --> 01:34:32,655
State your name, please.
- Marylee Hadley.

1021
01:34:32,766 --> 01:34:34,893
Do you swear the testimony
you're about to give...

1022
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:37,129
is the truth
and nothing but the truth?

1023
01:34:37,237 --> 01:34:39,137
- I do.
- Be seated.

1024
01:34:39,239 --> 01:34:44,336
You can refuse to answer any question
you may regard as incriminating.

1025
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:49,446
What was your relation
to the deceased?

1026
01:34:49,549 --> 01:34:52,245
He was my brother.

1027
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:55,788
Exactly where were you at
the time Kyle Hadley was shot?

1028
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:04,322
I repeat, Miss Hadley,

1029
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:07,958
exactly where were you at
the time Kyle Hadley was shot?

1030
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:14,199
You refuse to answer
the question?

1031
01:35:16,843 --> 01:35:19,812
Canyou tell us anything
about the shooting?

1032
01:35:19,913 --> 01:35:23,815
Yes. My brother,
he was killed.

1033
01:35:25,585 --> 01:35:27,644
By whom, Miss Hadley?

1034
01:35:27,754 --> 01:35:29,949
By whom
was your brother killed?

1035
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:42,665
Mitch Wayne.

1036
01:35:42,769 --> 01:35:45,260
Stop those men!

1037
01:35:45,372 --> 01:35:48,933
No one will leave this chamber
till after this inquest is closed.

1038
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:54,771
Miss Hadley,

1039
01:35:54,881 --> 01:35:56,781
you named Mitch Wayne.

1040
01:35:56,883 --> 01:35:59,317
Are you here and now
testifying...

1041
01:35:59,419 --> 01:36:01,853
that Mitch Wayne shot
and killed Kyle Hadley?

1042
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:12,465
Mitch Wayne was there...

1043
01:36:14,267 --> 01:36:16,360
in the study
with my brother.

1044
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,134
Kyle had a gun in his hand.

1045
01:36:21,241 --> 01:36:23,175
He was raving mad...

1046
01:36:24,378 --> 01:36:27,779
raving about things
that weren't so.

1047
01:36:28,915 --> 01:36:31,315
Mitch tried
to talk to him,

1048
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,886
to make him understand
how wrong he was,

1049
01:36:35,021 --> 01:36:37,148
to stop him
from using the gun.

1050
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:41,760
Afraid he might even use it
on himself.

1051
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:44,126
I made a grab for the gun.

1052
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:46,131
Kyle and I struggled.

1053
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,335
The gun went off.

1054
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,939
Miss Hadley,
five persons under oath...

1055
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:59,102
have testified that Mitch Wayne
threatened to kill Kyle Hadley.

1056
01:37:08,688 --> 01:37:12,522
They don't know Mitch Wayne
as I know hi m.

1057
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,019
Whatever he may have said...

1058
01:37:17,697 --> 01:37:19,858
means nothing.

1059
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:24,298
Except he was worried
about Kyle...

1060
01:37:24,404 --> 01:37:27,271
as a brother for a brother.

1061
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:30,832
Why would Kyle Hadley
want to kill himself?

1062
01:37:30,944 --> 01:37:34,175
He was depressed...

1063
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:38,140
by Father's sudden death,

1064
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:42,320
and he'd been drinking.

1065
01:37:43,423 --> 01:37:44,947
Heavily?

1066
01:37:46,126 --> 01:37:48,287
Yes.

1067
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,597
My brother always drank
too much.

1068
01:37:55,735 --> 01:37:57,635
He was sad...

1069
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,501
the saddest of us all.

1070
01:38:04,678 --> 01:38:06,578
He needed so much...

1071
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,150
and had so little.
