1
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,340
"Peaceful and prosperous country"

2
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,576
"Return to us our country"

3
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:28,876
Protect His Majesty!

4
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,056
Yes!

5
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,266
Tonight our brothers of the
Red Flower Society will take our revenge.

6
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,361
Let's go!

7
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,304
Yes!

8
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,636
Chan Ka Lok?

9
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,952
You dare to kill the emperor?

10
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,115
You belong to the Han race.

11
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,954
Yet you have become a Manchu emperor.

12
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,594
I want to kill you
on behalf of Han people.

13
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,158
Your Majesty, take care!

14
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,332
Why can't I ever have a sound sleep?

15
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,397
I should be punished!

16
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,502
Send for Governor Oryeetor.

17
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,595
Did you come to buy a sword?

18
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,725
No!

19
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,395
What do you want?

20
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,440
My master is suffering...

21
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,306
from serious insomnia.

22
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,379
He should see a doctor.

23
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,348
I am only a blacksmith.

24
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,979
It's useless to see a doctor.

25
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,319
My master said,

26
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,515
only when the demon
of his dream is killed.

27
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,925
Then he can have sound sleep.

28
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,656
What's the name of your master?

29
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,362
Emperor Chien Lung.

30
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,026
5 days ago,

31
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,198
I killed a member of
the Red Flower Society.

32
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,208
What? You killed our Fourth Brother?

33
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,573
I found a letter from his pocket,

34
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,210
Saying there is a name list...

35
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,750
kept by a blacksmith.

36
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,809
Right, but I sent it away.

37
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,216
You will never get it.

38
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,522
Really?

39
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,418
I want to avenge Fourth Brother's death!

40
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,075
- Search!
- Yes!

41
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,041
Tiger Lui is so rich.

42
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,976
What business was he doing in Shantung?

43
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,140
He used to be a bandit.

44
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,343
This sports competition
is sponsored by him.

45
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,646
So what?

46
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,814
Cocky bastard!

47
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,448
Buying so much land that,

48
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,150
within these three months,
he has bought half the town.

49
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,285
He is in league...

50
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,024
with the governor.

51
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,429
That's why he is so cocky.

52
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,830
What can we poor people do?

53
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,263
Miss, you'd better go home now.

54
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,867
So dad is a bastard
in the eyes of these people.

55
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,769
Miss, you know it only now?

56
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,770
Will we be recognized?

57
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,743
No, no one knows us, we'd better leave.

58
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,536
This girl is pretty.

59
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,603
Let me see...

60
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,774
- Let's go...
- Come on!

61
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,578
Shall we stay and have a look?

62
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,555
No, or master will scold us.

63
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,051
Miss, are you alone?

64
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,923
What do you want?

65
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,458
Are you a stranger here?

66
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,590
So pretty!

67
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,192
Don't bully us, we know Cantonese.

68
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,138
That's fine! So we can communicate!

69
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,707
Don't touch my sister!

70
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,005
Your sister?

71
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,945
I know him, he is bull shitting.

72
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,277
He has no sister.

73
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,214
I know you too.

74
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,210
You are a pimp.

75
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,254
How dare you insult my boss?

76
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,152
Beat him!

77
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,314
Come on!

78
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,252
You dare fight with our boss?

79
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,387
Beat him!

80
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,358
Do you want to be put behind bars?

81
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,534
None of his business.

82
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,399
This is the first day I reported duty,
give me face.

83
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,170
Let's see if he gives face or not.

84
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,640
Damn it, how dare you fight here?

85
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,012
Do you want to go to jail?

86
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,241
I am sorry...

87
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,249
No fighting!

88
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,911
Yes...

89
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,320
We are not allowed to fight here,

90
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,796
let's compete in the playground,
if you have guts.

91
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,560
Let's go!

92
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:21,040
He was a sports champion
from St. Joseph College in Shanghai.

93
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,871
Sai Yuk, you are not used to
these foreign games.

94
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,967
Damn it,

95
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,205
but he is good at kung-fu.

96
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,881
Look, your "brother"
is beating a retreat.

97
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,918
Bullshit, he isn't.

98
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,045
Let's compete.

99
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,082
18 feet.

100
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,021
Next!

101
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,288
He achieved good record, the next one.

102
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,556
He's been the sports champions
of St. Joseph College for 3 years.

103
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,065
22 feet!

104
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,262
Break record! How wonderful!

105
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,361
Let's see the next one.

106
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,837
I don't have any record
or information about him.

107
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,310
Let's see.

108
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,549
Scared?

109
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,420
Jump!

110
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,317
You're so slow.

111
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,257
Let me give you a hand.

112
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,520
Why don't you jump?

113
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,454
He is jumping.

114
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,224
Wonderful!

115
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,604
He has broken a new record!

116
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,535
Bravo!

117
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,675
So smart!

118
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,108
Although you are a little ant.

119
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,702
I won't bully you.

120
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,576
Bastard, the next race
is 400 meters relay.

121
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,743
I won't lose this one.

122
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,913
There should be 4 people in a relay.

123
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,479
We have three only.

124
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,867
Miss, we need 4 people,

125
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:56,763
we're only three.

126
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,962
Are you willing to help?

127
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,595
- Can I?
- Yes!

128
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,364
But I run slowly!

129
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,274
Are you slower than an ant?

130
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:05,873
More or less the same.

131
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,412
That's good enough!

132
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,446
You run first!

133
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,611
How about me?

134
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,813
Bo, you run first!

135
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,885
Ready...

136
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,718
Go!

137
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,828
Hurry up!

138
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:32,195
"Young at heart, boundless world"

139
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:36,168
"Can climb every mountain"

140
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,242
"There seems many obstacles"

141
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:46,215
"Take the challenge,
reach the boundless world"

142
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,513
- I can't anymore.
- No problem!

143
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,023
"Practise kung-fu and show your talent"

144
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,581
"Take the challenge..."

145
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,121
Are you alright?

146
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:02,234
"Be happy, create a happy life"

147
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,835
Hurry up...

148
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,133
You'll lose!

149
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:17,115
"Young at heart, the world is yours"

150
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:21,119
"In this unlimited place"

151
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,350
It's my turn!

152
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,358
Hurry...

153
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,997
How amazing is the pig tail!

154
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,828
Yes! Straightened pig tail!

155
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:47,379
"Be happy, create a happy life"

156
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,347
"Proud of yourself and love yourself"

157
00:10:55,154 --> 00:11:01,855
"Young at heart, the world is yours"

158
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,927
"In this unlimited place"

159
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,590
"let your dreams fly"

160
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,828
Oh! Flying stance.

161
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,867
Hey, young man,
you've gained 2 championships,

162
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,841
join us next year.

163
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,638
You, St. Joseph's student,
go back and eat shit!

164
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,745
Thank you, Miss!

165
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,117
You have a share of this medal.

166
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,246
For you!

167
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,255
How about you?

168
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,815
This is a present from Tiger Lui,
I don't want it.

169
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,692
May I know your name?

170
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:37,792
Chan!

171
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,057
Damn it!

172
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,426
What are you doing?

173
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,967
You make me lose face.

174
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:43,965
Beat him!

175
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,866
Yes!

176
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,369
I love fighting. Come on!

177
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,679
Come on!

178
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,862
You want some more?

179
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,264
No...

180
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:50,991
Thank you...

181
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,630
Thank you for sparing time
to fight with me.

182
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,200
What are you fighting for?

183
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,169
Who joined the fight?

184
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,903
They did, I arrested them for you.

185
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,272
You are most enthusiastic.

186
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,074
- Thank you.
- Take them away.

187
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:03,778
What?

188
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,816
You too!

189
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:05,543
What?

190
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,482
Yes, go now!

191
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,144
Are you kidding?

192
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,918
Wait...

193
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,381
Go!

194
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,584
Don't push me!

195
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,324
Damn you! You son of a bitch!

196
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,890
Damn you! Why didn't he see me
the Central Primary School?

197
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,430
How dare he offend me?

198
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,106
Go tell the Governor.

199
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,199
Say he's been robbing.

200
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,809
And cut his head off.

201
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,867
Yes, Master!

202
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,237
Master,

203
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,715
I've heard many gossip about us.

204
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,012
So what?

205
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,382
Should I be scared?

206
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,687
Of course not, master.

207
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,687
But, there is an old Chinese saying that,

208
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,359
you should follow the rules
of the village which you have entered.

209
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,622
If we want to establish
our power in Canton.

210
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,358
We should mix with the people.

211
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:54,829
How?

212
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,492
I have an idea.

213
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,434
If we want to make a name,

214
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,062
and establish power here,

215
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,305
let's arrange for a kung-fu competition
to select a son-in-law for you.

216
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,073
It's not fair to Ting Ting.

217
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,008
Master, you should be decisive.

218
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,551
The daughter would marry anyway.

219
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,019
She will leave your family
and change her surname.

220
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,715
She won't remember her parents.

221
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,281
Please consider.

222
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,690
Did your father and mother-in-law...

223
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,523
gain any benefits from you?

224
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,732
Damn it, what you said
is just what I have in mind.

225
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,165
I was about to propose it.

226
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,897
It's very wise of you, master.

227
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,199
It's a deal!

228
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,206
Get Ting a husband
with a Kung-fu competition.

229
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,743
Sai Yuk,

230
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,244
we should never tell others that,

231
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,370
we've been caught.

232
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,471
Right, if you dad knows that,

233
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,446
that'd be troublesome!

234
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,176
Don't worry, I wrote us false names.

235
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:45,945
You are called Yuen Kwei.

236
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:46,814
You are called Lau Chun Wai.

237
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,412
How about you?

238
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,886
I am Wong...

239
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,250
Jing!

240
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,984
Well, I have to go home now.

241
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,494
Or my mom would teach me a lesson.

242
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,359
Come around if you have time. Bye-bye!

243
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,397
Yuk!

244
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,271
Her curly hair is cute!

245
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,934
His dark glasses are funny too!

246
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,107
Isn't it black now?

247
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,714
Shit!
Nothing can be seen, but it's smart!

248
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,746
She is blind!

249
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,789
Miss!

250
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,350
You scared me!

251
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,653
You look good!

252
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,833
Your voice is sexy!

253
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,868
Are you selling cloth?

254
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,301
Bull shit!

255
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,931
What kind of cloth...

256
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,996
would you like?

257
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,007
The one outside!

258
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,373
That one?

259
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,212
I won't give it a damn.

260
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,541
Right, this one.

261
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,345
This one?

262
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,646
Yes!

263
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,611
How many yards do you want?

264
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,319
I want...

265
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,213
That much!

266
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,121
No, less...

267
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,682
- So much?
- No, here...

268
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,159
- Here?
- No, just that much,

269
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,819
- Here?
- Yes.

270
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,122
That little! For wrapping a dumpling?

271
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,836
How dare you steal?

272
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,800
You bastard...

273
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,932
Shut up!

274
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,203
No! Mom, that...

275
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,301
Be polite!

276
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,103
It hurts!

277
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,605
Mom, you are pretty.

278
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,773
Shut up, give me the weight-measure,

279
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:24,838
Yes, mom.

280
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,345
What for!

281
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,646
Our cloth is not measured by yards.
It's measured by weight.

282
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,510
Otherwise you won't take so much!

283
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,217
Aren't you blind?

284
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,883
You are blind.

285
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,084
You thought I hit you by chance?

286
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,627
That shows I'm not in your good grace.
I am leaving.

287
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,121
You wanna escape?

288
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,894
This is for you.

289
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,373
Mom, we're in trouble!

290
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,435
Don't worry, 2 cm to the mark.

291
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,445
Really?

292
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,607
No blood,

293
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,983
no blood please!

294
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,917
Mom, you're wrong!

295
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,118
It's 6 mm to the mark, look!

296
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,625
They have deep throat!

297
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,130
He deserves it!

298
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,221
I'm in a good mood,
let's take the afternoon off.

299
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,765
You took a day off yesterday
because you were in a bad mood.

300
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,025
You want to rest today
because of good mood?

301
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,261
Sure, your dad is coming back today.

302
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,200
I can't concentrate.

303
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,259
Make it a day-off.

304
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:20,905
Mom!

305
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,204
Mom, I met a very pretty girl today.

306
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,709
She has character.

307
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,006
Then, let's take an extra holiday
the day after tomorrow.

308
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,904
Another day off?

309
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,275
Young master.

310
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,816
Young master, bad news!

311
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,684
What's the matter?

312
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,786
The Governor has come.

313
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,290
He is talking with Master.

314
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,788
What is it?

315
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,919
If fought with someone today.

316
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,995
Don't panic, there's always your mom.

317
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,267
Your Excellency, death friends,

318
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,270
You can be sure
I will do the right thing.

319
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,907
Yes, Master Fong is such a righteous man.

320
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,701
I feel shame!

321
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,577
I assure you I will punish...

322
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,309
So many friends!

323
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,815
Hello everybody.

324
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,385
No matter what had happened,

325
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,389
I, Miu Tsui Fa will be responsible.

326
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,951
Of course you should be responsible.

327
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,686
You, you beat that foreigner up.

328
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,827
And the cloth you sold me...

329
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,798
last time was stinky.

330
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,992
She insulted my wife,
saying that she was fat.

331
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,934
And refused to sell her cloth.

332
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,268
She teased me!
Saying that I'm as stupid as a pig.

333
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,507
She is too much!

334
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,305
What's your explanation?

335
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,035
I would not have come back
if I knew I had to face this.

336
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,440
Macu, get the cane.

337
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,743
What? Not again!

338
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,521
Master, for my sake...

339
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,916
For you sake?

340
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,491
Never mind.

341
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,732
Dad, please forgive mom!

342
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,270
Please hit me instead.

343
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,169
Look at our son! He is nice.

344
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,577
Is it the Fong family?

345
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,042
Oh, you are Fong Sai Yuk,

346
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,244
not Wong Jing!

347
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,447
Why do you call yourself Wong Jing?

348
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,318
He was caught fighting this morning and,

349
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,882
in the police station
he claimed to be Wong Jing.

350
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,925
You little scoundrel!

351
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,126
Are you hurt?

352
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,430
Yes!

353
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,699
I shielded you from most of your blows,
so don't cry for pain.

354
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,068
Mom, since you are so good at Kung-fu!

355
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,373
But you just let dad beat you up.

356
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,235
I should give him some face
in front of other people.

357
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,540
The status of a man in a family
is very precious and important.

358
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,510
Yes, it's precious and important indeed.

359
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,746
Get some sleep now!

360
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,821
Yes, dad.

361
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,731
I don't know how you teach your son!

362
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,232
He's a grown-up,

363
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,269
but just loiters around
involving in fights.

364
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,770
Kids should be independent.

365
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,404
All you care about is your business.

366
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,272
If our son don't keep me company,
who would?

367
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,449
You listen to these gossiping fools.

368
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,212
And best me up in front of everybody.

369
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,684
You don't treat me as your wife at all.

370
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,027
Listen to me.

371
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,219
I won't.

372
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,693
Listen to me.

373
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,356
No, I won't...

374
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,698
"The beauty put up the curtain."

375
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,967
Oh God! He is reciting poetry again.

376
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,703
"And sits moody with furrowed brows."

377
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,881
"We only see stains of her tears."

378
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,840
"No one knows who she is hating."

379
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,396
I can't stand it!

380
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,105
He is too smart! Too Romantic!

381
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,566
So great!

382
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,303
Every time he recites poetry
I'm so excited.

383
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,869
I feel dizzy!

384
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,077
Am I wrong to scold you like this?

385
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,709
No!

386
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,885
Now why don't you come to bed?

387
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,451
Yes!

388
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,931
"Our Fist conquers the whole of Canton."

389
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,472
"Our Kick subdues Soochow and Hangchau."

390
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,938
What kind of bluffing is it?

391
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,413
Master, how is my writing?

392
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,881
Once it is hung out,

393
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,850
See, so many people
are gathered around it.

394
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,917
Ting Ting...

395
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,856
I don't want to select my husband
through the kung-fu competition.

396
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,326
Stop bothering me.

397
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,325
If you force me,

398
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,294
I will run away.

399
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,728
Shut up, or I will beat you to death.

400
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,034
- Damn it!
- Maybe you should...

401
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,695
...deal with Ting Ting in gentler way.

402
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,164
When I am talking, you shut up.

403
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,542
I do this to impress the local people.

404
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,101
If I don't get better status here.

405
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,670
Do you understand?

406
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,551
Why are you laughing?

407
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,143
I am not play acting! Damn it!

408
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,657
Can you stand it?

409
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,230
Sure! I can still stand it.

410
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,959
Really?

411
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,592
- Alright. I'll try again.
- Sure.

412
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,193
Son, does it work?

413
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,338
What's wrong?

414
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,736
Isn't it alright?

415
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,606
It's like barbecue!

416
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,700
Sure, I saw foreigners do this.

417
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,500
Do this to my eyebrow later, alright?

418
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,809
Sure, anywhere can do.

419
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,280
It's awful!

420
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,385
Would your dad like
and recite poem to me?

421
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,613
He will love it!
May be he will recite an English poem.

422
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,088
English poem?
May be, I would be more excited.

423
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,221
How is English poem?

424
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,063
I know, say, "Wonderful..."

425
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,235
How do you know it?

426
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,132
I am taught by Josephine Siao.

427
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,192
Sai Yuk...

428
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,168
Hurry up, your dad is back.

429
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
Quick!

430
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:32,571
Shit! My hubby!

431
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,542
What are you doing?

432
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,772
Honey, don't come in.

433
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,938
I want to show you something nice.

434
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,448
Mom, sit down, don't move.

435
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,245
Sai Yuk!

436
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,614
Wait, don't come in.

437
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,944
I'll be pretty soon.

438
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,884
Shit...

439
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:45,718
What is it?

440
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,816
It's on fire. On fire!

441
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,262
What happened?

442
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,699
None of my business.

443
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,895
I'm going to study.

444
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,164
I am going to town,

445
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,899
what do you want to buy?

446
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,838
It's such a nice hairstyle! Damn it!

447
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,951
Friends, countrymen!

448
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,212
I, Tiger Lui is a new comer to this town.

449
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,621
I want to stay peacefully
and happily with all of you.

450
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,487
So, I arrange this competition
to recruit a son-in-law.

451
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,552
Who gets the ribbon, who is the winner.

452
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,027
About the regulations,

453
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,767
once you step on the floor, you lose.

454
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,703
If anybody can defeat my wife,
Lee Siu Wan,

455
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:37,333
he can marry my daughter, Lui Ting Ting.

456
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,978
If anyone is killed or hurt by my wife,

457
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,571
the Lu family won't be responsible.

458
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,183
Now, my wife, Lee Siu Wan...

459
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,828
She is pretty.

460
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:01,729
If she marries me,

461
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,993
I shall spend all my nights
not sleeping...

462
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,263
You think you are capable?

463
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,269
I can ask for your help!

464
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,635
Okay, it's a deal. Let's go.

465
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,003
Let's go.

466
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,037
They are real friends.

467
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,476
Bo, tell Fong Sai Yuk
to go for the competition.

468
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,513
Okay...

469
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,980
Sorry, excuse me, please give way...

470
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,109
Where is Sai Yuk?

471
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,650
He is studying inside.

472
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,779
I am going to the mill.

473
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,516
Come home soon.

474
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,653
"After the storm,
numberless blossoms... fall..."

475
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,263
One, two. So much!

476
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,362
Who is it?

477
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,961
Sai Yuk, come out...

478
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,494
Sai Yuk!

479
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:48,637
"The birds cried...

480
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,149
After the storm.

481
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,451
Numberless blossoms...". Dad!

482
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,147
Sai Yuk, sit down.

483
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,919
I have to leave for town today.

484
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,858
Dad, how long will you stay in the town?
I will miss you.

485
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,022
Work hard.

486
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,063
Yes!

487
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,095
Today is not suitable for studying.

488
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:16,941
What's up?

489
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,635
Tiger Lui arranged a competition
to recruit a son-in-law.

490
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,677
His daughter is very pretty.

491
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,177
- Really?
- He said he is the best kung-fu fighter...

492
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,405
in Canton and Soo Hang.

493
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,041
Damn, what a big mouth!

494
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,914
Sai Yuk, what should we do?

495
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,614
Well?

496
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,851
Keep on studying.

497
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,651
Are you kidding?

498
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,716
My dad is in. If he knows that,

499
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,125
He'll kill me.

500
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,058
Young Master, what are you doing?

501
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,099
Sai Yuk, should we just
let those bastards kick us around?

502
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,193
You'll defeat them easily.

503
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,602
Come down quick, master is coming.

504
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,070
Macu!

505
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,807
Take my place.

506
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:52,638
No way!

507
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:53,405
I'll be back soon.

508
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:58,040
Young Master... I can't,
I have to go to town with master.

509
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,299
Master, bad news!

510
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,600
- What?
- Ting Ting disappeared.

511
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,733
Gone!

512
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,441
Damn!

513
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,617
Come on.

514
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,382
Master,

515
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,320
it's not right...

516
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,722
Don't stare!

517
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,920
It's alright this way?

518
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,121
Sure!

519
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,201
You want to get a wife?

520
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,469
My heart longs for a pretty woman!

521
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,103
Well, what about your vacation?

522
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,878
Dear friends,

523
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,648
it seems it's difficult...

524
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,481
to find a true hero in Canton.

525
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,185
Rubbish!

526
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,691
Bravo...

527
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,888
The new comer's name?

528
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,055
I am well known,

529
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,200
One of the ten most-outstanding
youngsters of Canton.

530
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,635
The "Invincible Magic Fist" Fong Sai Yuk.

531
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,030
No bad-looking boy,

532
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:34,340
But first my wife must
put you to the test.

533
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,042
You're the trophy?

534
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,018
Not me! My daughter!

535
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,412
Just a peek!

536
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,648
Watch it, young man!

537
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,255
Lend me your head.

538
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,832
How dare you trick me?

539
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,883
My feet not yet on the ground.

540
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,721
Don't worry,
We'll play till one of us loses.

541
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,655
Now try our Cantonese
tournament on heads.

542
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,934
Oh, my head.

543
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,493
It's hurt! Oh my neck!

544
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,201
What a bad luck to be stepped by a woman.

545
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,935
Great! Beat her!

546
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:15,877
Sai Yuk, beat her.

547
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,073
Can you make it?

548
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,172
Sure, we can.

549
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,079
I can't!

550
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,845
Get her down!

551
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,884
Hey, steady!

552
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,002
Oh, my neck!

553
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,847
I feel dizzy!

554
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,183
Honey, be careful!

555
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,588
Yes! I'll be careful!

556
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,057
Lend me your pig-tail.

557
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,790
My hair!

558
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,854
Hands off!

559
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,465
Beat her.

560
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,275
Knock her down...

561
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,579
Special request by the audience.

562
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,816
Catch my wife.

563
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,116
They're coming to help!

564
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,329
- How is it?
- Don't panic, the more the merrier.

565
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,363
Be careful. I can stand no more.

566
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,683
I'll destroy your footholds.

567
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,658
Bo, come and help.

568
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:20,026
We support you.

569
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,404
You Cantonese are not united at all.

570
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,609
Are you okay?

571
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,738
Sure! I am alright.

572
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,147
Do you want to support yourself
with these 2 poles?

573
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,376
You don't have six poles to support you,

574
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,545
can you hold it?

575
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,747
Fight!

576
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,585
If you can win her,
you'll be my son-in-law.

577
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,430
Beat her!

578
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,728
Your men are getting tired.

579
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,864
Let's fight.

580
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,313
How dare you pull my hair!
I'll attack you eyes in return.

581
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,407
Watch my kick.

582
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,348
Go to hell.

583
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,646
Watch mine!

584
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:09,817
My eye is hurt.

585
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,787
- Are you alright?
- I am fine...

586
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,919
Come on!

587
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,924
Beat them.

588
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,119
Beat them.

589
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,129
I'll bite you to death.

590
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,534
Hold it!

591
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,029
Bo is beaten.

592
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,202
I'll help!

593
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,045
Grab your poles.

594
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,620
I can stand no more.

595
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,330
Young Master, don't disappoint us.

596
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,491
I have never disappointed you.

597
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,731
My head fist.

598
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,940
Help me get up.

599
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,209
Madam!

600
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,249
Don't fall down!

601
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,313
I am lucky to get hold of it.
Come, kick me.

602
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,289
I lost! I surrender!

603
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,727
Sai Yuk, how can you let us down?

604
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,957
But if I didn't do so,
I would have let myself down.

605
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,359
How come you lost?

606
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,799
I am sorry, I lost!

607
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,938
Miss, I am sorry, I lost.

608
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,869
Kid, we may talk...

609
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,441
Damn it!

610
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,246
The Outstanding Youth lost.

611
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,439
Anybody wants it?

612
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,742
Lost again!

613
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,712
Is there an Outstanding Youth in Canton?
I wonder!

614
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,412
You're exaggerating!

615
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,011
That's why I have some extra customers.

616
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,280
I want to make another bet.

617
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,983
Let's see who will be the final winner.

618
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,216
If you want to win,

619
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,291
get my son to fight.

620
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,022
It's useless, Fong Sai Yuk just lost.

621
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,361
How dare he claim himself
the Outstanding Youth in Canton.

622
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,523
I think you are
no longer number one here.

623
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,696
Really, that son of mine
should do better.

624
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,601
Heroes, gentlemen,

625
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,773
Any one else for a fight?

626
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,312
If not,
we'll continuous tomorrow morning.

627
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,719
Wait!

628
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,450
There is money on the ground!

629
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,648
Go and pick up the money!

630
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,020
Lend me your back!

631
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,159
I'm coming too.

632
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,962
Great!

633
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,832
May I know the name of this hero?

634
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,565
May I know the name of this beauty?

635
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,471
Don't feel shy.

636
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,546
I am Mrs. Lui,
the mother of Lui Ting Ting.

637
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,238
If you can defeat me,

638
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,646
I'll be your mother-in-law.

639
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,317
Why not marry the mother-in-law too?

640
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,477
What a big mouth!

641
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,423
Well? What do you think?

642
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,093
Stop, or you will fall down.

643
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,393
Who are you? How dare you?

644
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,762
Damn it!

645
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,025
Read my lips, it should be...

646
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,467
D-A-M-N l-T!

647
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,902
I am the invincible kung-fu Master,

648
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,134
The brother of Fong Sai Yuk.

649
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,277
My name is Fong Tai Yuk.

650
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,247
Both brothers are braggarts.

651
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,877
Is your Kung-fu powerful...

652
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,921
Leave the question to Madam,
she will answer you later.

653
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,750
Why such a big fuss
just to get hold of this?

654
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,255
I want it!

655
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,492
Good foot-work!

656
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,562
So is yours.

657
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,307
Madam, why did you hold my leg?

658
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,425
You have smooth face.

659
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,629
Madam, you needn't be so nervous!

660
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,699
Thank you!

661
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,338
Madam, you are heavy.

662
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,806
Don't panic, I am here.

663
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,445
Why don't you come up? I'm helping you.

664
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,676
Come up!

665
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,478
The ribbon!

666
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,111
Be careful!

667
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,715
A secret attack?

668
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,788
A heavy attack.

669
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,792
Madam!

670
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,769
We are on the ground now.

671
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,169
Are you alright?

672
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,538
I am fine!

673
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,805
But I am not!

674
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,906
She is my wife, do you know that?

675
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,014
Dear fellows,

676
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,379
Fong's family is the
No. 1 Kung-fu family in Canton.

677
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,449
And our Lui family.

678
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,152
Stop touching me.

679
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,086
We are relatives now.

680
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,287
Who is your relative?

681
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,895
I come only to fight,
but not for your daughter!

682
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,493
How about my daughter?

683
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:24,994
I don't want her.

684
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,728
Kid, repeat that if you dare!

685
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,798
Read my lips.

686
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,206
I DON'T WANT HER!

687
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,717
You joined the competition,
you must marry my daughter.

688
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,579
Or I will ask the governor to arrest you!

689
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,381
Damn!

690
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,715
Damn what?

691
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,314
Don't touch my face!

692
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,520
If you ruin my face...

693
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,529
I want you finger print.

694
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,700
So you won't deny the deal.

695
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,933
Press on it.

696
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,588
Who catches my staff?

697
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,918
Your mom, me...

698
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,058
Mom, you look handsome.

699
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,061
I just did this for you,

700
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,496
to gain face for you.

701
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,758
Get me a bag.

702
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,762
What for?

703
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,430
I won in the Kung-fu Competition.
Lui forced me to marry his daughter.

704
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,938
So we should leave at once.

705
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,338
Mom, you are great!

706
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,441
Lesbian?

707
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,768
What?

708
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,612
Shit, they are coming.

709
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,578
What now?

710
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:44,409
Let's fight them.

711
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,312
Yes!

712
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,514
Watch mine.

713
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,655
Fong Tai Yuk, I am coming...

714
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:02,698
Fong Tai Yuk...

715
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,227
Fong Tai Yuk...

716
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,600
Search!

717
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,832
Yes!

718
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,733
They are inside, search!

719
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,042
I told you to search,
what are you looking for?

720
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:17,773
Go search!

721
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:18,473
Yes!

722
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,846
Go search!

723
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,381
Damn it!

724
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,117
Fong Tai Yuk.

725
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,159
Why are you crying?

726
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,860
Where is Fong Tai Yuk?

727
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,523
He is dead!

728
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,624
Dead? How come?

729
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,997
He died on the street!

730
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,636
What? At least there is corpse.

731
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,569
It's burnt.

732
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,271
I can recognise him, even in ashes.

733
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,744
Let me see.

734
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,938
Really? Are you still
interested in the ashes?

735
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,815
Mom...

736
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,815
Look. The ashes.

737
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,880
Mom, run.

738
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,889
Don't go!

739
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:05,694
You are a man.

740
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:06,787
Bullshit!

741
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,059
Aren't you a man?

742
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:11,767
Don't move.

743
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,700
Or I'll kill him.

744
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,567
Son, why are you holding a banana?

745
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:15,602
Banana?

746
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,867
Isn't it a knife?

747
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,205
Catch him...

748
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,443
Freeze! Don't go!

749
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,547
Come down, do you hear?

750
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,758
Mom!

751
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,929
Forget about me, run for your life.

752
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,057
No, I will be punished by God
if I leave like this.

753
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,359
I am coming.

754
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,597
So great!

755
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,328
I tell you, we can't get your elder son.

756
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,305
We will take your younger son
as substitute.

757
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,869
Master, we've found Miss Ting.

758
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,938
Thank God.

759
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,106
Hey,

760
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,579
wait for my husband
to celebrate the wedding.

761
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,150
Okay, the wedding ceremony later,

762
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,446
but the Bridal Chamber first.

763
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,750
Go!

764
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,957
Disperse...

765
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,925
Go home...

766
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,793
Hand the man out.

767
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,765
Listen, leave here at once.

768
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,394
If you stay, you'll be arrested.

769
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,597
Let him go!

770
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,534
Your Honour!

771
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,471
Brother Lui.

772
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,440
What's up?

773
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,806
The people outside are all furious.

774
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:27,875
I heard...

775
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,436
that the Governor of Kau Mun
will come soon.

776
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,611
Your Honour, you should help me.

777
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:33,775
Get your son-in-law...

778
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,285
to get married in front of the people,

779
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,083
saying that he is willing to do so.

780
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:43,388
Then, we won't have any problem
if the Governor comes.

781
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,486
Okay, I'll force him to say he's willing.

782
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,561
Impossible! We should not use force
but virtuous persuasion.

783
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,499
Then we won't get into trouble.

784
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,930
Right, virtuous persuasion.

785
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:06,078
I won't lose my virginity to you.

786
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,284
If he dares touch me, I will kill him.

787
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,884
She pretends to be lady!

788
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,822
Makes me puke!

789
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,817
I want to scare the hag.

790
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,796
He's coming.

791
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,494
I want to scare you to death.

792
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,897
What do you want?

793
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,305
Are you kidding? Do you want to kill me?

794
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,570
That's too much!

795
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:40,980
What do you want?

796
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,746
I tell you, you can have my body,

797
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,752
but not my heart.

798
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:44,879
I love someone else.

799
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,820
Me too. I won't marry you.

800
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,255
I won't marry you too.

801
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,691
Okay, swear! What if you marry me?

802
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,619
My family will all die.

803
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,196
- What is this?
- Give it back to me.

804
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,731
Why do you keep such rubbish with you?

805
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,568
Idiot!

806
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,606
Sleep by yourself.
