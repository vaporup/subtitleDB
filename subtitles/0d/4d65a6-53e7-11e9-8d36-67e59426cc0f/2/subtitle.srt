1
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,207
Don't beg me, I won't come back.

2
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:27,346
I don't come to beg you.

3
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:29,876
What did you come for?

4
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:33,145
In fact, our situations are the same.

5
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:37,152
I was taken as Tiger's maid at 12.

6
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:39,419
I have been his concubine since I was 16.

7
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:41,619
I am the same as you.

8
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,760
I have had no romance before marriage.

9
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:46,993
How come? You are happy at least,
you are willing to marry him.

10
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:48,729
I am forced to do so.

11
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:54,070
These 20 years, I think I am happy.

12
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,575
I married a rich husband,

13
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:58,737
and have a good daughter.

14
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,781
After seeing your brother on stage.

15
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:07,516
I realize that I am cheating myself.

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,718
Actually, I need...

17
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:14,655
What do you need?

18
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:18,663
Love!

19
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,233
What! You are fond of my brother?

20
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:24,066
I know he is alive.

21
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:26,364
If you see you brother again.

22
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:30,532
Please give this letter to him.

23
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:33,175
Aren't you afraid of Tiger Lui?

24
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:42,852
For love, I fear nothing.

25
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,090
Mom, you are great!

26
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:53,759
You've won a girl's heart.

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,604
Actually, my brother is...

28
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:05,067
I know you are better than your brother.

29
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:07,106
Oh, it's you!

30
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:09,043
What do you want?

31
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:11,016
Nothing, I just want you to know that,

32
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:13,653
l, Tiger Lui is a man
of virtuous persuasion.

33
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:17,020
I don't want to make you
to be my son-in-law by force.

34
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:21,124
We should explore each other's merits.

35
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:25,097
Maybe, we shall find
we have many common interests.

36
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:26,527
Common interests?

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,192
- Right!
- Really?

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,535
I won't be angry.

39
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,466
Virtuous persuasion.

40
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,172
Virtuous persuasion.

41
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,911
Virtuous persuasion.

42
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,080
Why is it so noisy?

43
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,251
I want to be a man
of virtuous persuasion.

44
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:55,159
"I practise singing early in the morning"

45
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,886
"Beat the drum"

46
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:59,897
"Singing can help me to win a wife"

47
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,525
"It's great"

48
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,127
"Where's your mother?"

49
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:08,403
"The wrong thing she did
is to give birth to you"

50
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:14,714
"Beat the drum and be healthy"

51
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:18,650
"I am going to destroy this family"

52
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:26,620
"Your mother is not mine"

53
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,451
"Beat the drum"

54
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,430
"Singing can help me to win a wife"

55
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,125
"It's great"

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,436
"Your mother better not have you"

57
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:46,271
"Beat the drum and be healthy"

58
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:50,716
"I am going to destroy this house"

59
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:07,033
Your mom is not my mom.

60
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:12,232
My mom is not my mom.

61
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:17,371
You've gained weight.

62
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:20,345
I always eat, that's why I get fat.

63
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:22,740
Have you lost your virginity?

64
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,312
No!

65
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:27,681
That's better.

66
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,817
Do you want to escape?

67
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,120
I don't know you situation.

68
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:36,259
If I escape,

69
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,988
You might get into trouble.

70
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,555
Anyway, I am tailed by so many people.

71
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,201
I can't escape.

72
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,770
What a good boy.

73
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:46,965
I have checked the way of escape
when I entered.

74
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,066
I will save you tonight.

75
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,402
Then, we will burn our house.

76
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,777
They will think that
both of us are dead, right?

77
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:56,816
Then we will go to town for your dad.

78
00:04:56,884 --> 00:04:58,317
Let's cheat them
for the rest for their live.

79
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:00,018
We'll never come back.

80
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,112
No one will know anything.

81
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,020
What?

82
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,428
Mom, you look so wicked.

83
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,627
Someone wants me
to send you this letter.

84
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:15,566
Who is it?

85
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:16,694
Your girlfriend.

86
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:24,643
Siu Wan,

87
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:27,772
I will meet an important guest tonight
with the governor.

88
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:30,112
I will be home late,
you'd better go to bed first.

89
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:51,461
Mom, dogs!

90
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:53,267
Nothing to be afraid of!

91
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:58,306
Did you offend the bitch?

92
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:02,140
Don't chase me!

93
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:04,507
It's horrible to be chased by the dogs!

94
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:05,609
Mom, run!

95
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:07,176
It's shit to be...

96
00:06:07,254 --> 00:06:09,085
chased by the dogs!

97
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:10,316
This way!

98
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:23,803
Who is it? How dare you break into
the Lui's mansion?

99
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,903
Bite him!

100
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,065
Madam!

101
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,638
Stop!

102
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,844
Tai Yuk, it's you.

103
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,807
That's right! It's me.

104
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:35,379
Ask your fellow to leave me alone.

105
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,610
So they can't hear our talk.

106
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,849
Fine.

107
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:41,848
1, 2, 3, 4, go back.

108
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:45,182
Hurry up!

109
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,755
- Tai Yuk!
- Don't come over.

110
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:50,792
I am afraid I can't accept you love.

111
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:56,161
Since I received your letter,

112
00:06:57,104 --> 00:07:00,904
I have been suffering thinking of you.

113
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:05,804
I can't stand it any longer.

114
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,780
So I come to see you now.

115
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,581
"The beauty put up the curtain."

116
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,484
"She sits with furrowed brows."

117
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,883
"One sees only the stain of tears."

118
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,423
"Who is it that she hates?"

119
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:29,830
Madam, this poem is
specially written for you.

120
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:33,071
He knows how to write a poem!

121
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:34,866
There is noise.

122
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,907
Madam, I have to go now.

123
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,372
See you later.

124
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:44,945
Tai Yuk!

125
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:46,585
Madam, what's the matter?

126
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:49,322
Nothing, why are you here?

127
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,414
Who asked you to come here?

128
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,755
It's wise to leave now.

129
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,678
It's you? It's me!

130
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:16,144
You?!

131
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,346
It's you!

132
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,514
Miss Chan,

133
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,487
have you also been
kidnapped by Tiger Lui?

134
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:24,615
Yes, how about you?

135
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,418
Me too!

136
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:30,754
I tried to find you
in the Playfield afterwards.

137
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:34,399
Me too! I waited for a long time.

138
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:37,362
You didn't come, so I left.

139
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:41,931
You mean you were waiting for me?

140
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,101
She waited for me!

141
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:50,278
Do you want this gold medal?

142
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:52,108
You always take this along with you?

143
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:55,780
I heard noise over there.

144
00:08:55,856 --> 00:08:57,050
- Did you find anyone?
- Nothing!

145
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:58,785
I am afraid, I have to go.

146
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:03,923
Watch out, there are dogs.

147
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:09,095
If I leave like this,
I can never seen Miss Chan again.

148
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:13,135
Fong Sai Yuk is here, come and get him.

149
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,333
Fong Sai Yuk is here, come!

150
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:17,510
The purpose of my visit,

151
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:20,407
is to destroy the rebels
of the Red Flower Society.

152
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:24,313
I have got a clue that,
they'll appear in this town.

153
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:29,121
I hope, once you get any information
about the rebels,

154
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:30,984
come and inform me right away.

155
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:32,549
Yes, Sir!

156
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:36,257
Don't worry, I will try me best.

157
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,855
My heart is devoted to the Court.

158
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:44,536
Please take note of my efforts.

159
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,074
Help me!

160
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:53,204
What?

161
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,373
My husband returned from town yesterday.

162
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,212
He did not see his son
and got angry with me.

163
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:58,717
He punished me. Look, he beat me up.

164
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:01,253
He burnt my hand.

165
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:03,152
Alas! Poor me!

166
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:04,815
None of my business!

167
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,756
I just want you...

168
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:08,326
to let Sai Yuk meet his dad,

169
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:12,020
just one day will do, one day only.

170
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,425
If Mr. Fong really misses his son,

171
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:17,667
he may come and visit him.

172
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:19,968
Or, come and live here...

173
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,099
for as long as you like.

174
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:24,166
You are too cruel.

175
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:26,839
Well, I will kill myself in front of you.

176
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:29,404
Where is the wall?

177
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,951
Where is the wall?

178
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:34,749
Don't do that!

179
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:38,981
Master, just let Sai Yuk
come back for one day.

180
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:42,661
I don't believe she will
bump her head against the wall.

181
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,294
Let her try.

182
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,895
I'm sure she won't.

183
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:49,765
Okay, I will die in front of you.
Tai Yuk...

184
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:50,564
Tai Yuk...?

185
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:52,662
- Tai Yuk, mom is going to die.
- Don't...

186
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,536
- Tai Yuk, mom is going to die.
- Master,

187
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,337
you are man of virtuous persuasion,
aren't you?

188
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,206
Don't!

189
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:58,744
A man of virtuous persuasion, right!

190
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:01,144
Take him home now,
bring him back tomorrow.

191
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:02,211
Thank you.

192
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:08,145
Master is here.

193
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,619
Mom, is dad back?

194
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:14,854
It is a lie.

195
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:16,825
Pack up,
we are going to look for your dad.

196
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:18,023
Okay!

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,967
He is back!

198
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:22,964
He has a dark face!

199
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:30,134
Freeze!

200
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,774
Why don't tell me about the wedding?

201
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,145
How can you be his mom?

202
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:37,114
I left for a few days,

203
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:38,742
and you lostom son.

204
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,548
How can I face our ancestors?

205
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,088
I...

206
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:44,123
Shut up!

207
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,591
It's none of his business.
I should be blamed.

208
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,391
Any way, I am no good as a wife.

209
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:50,723
I don't know how to teach my son.

210
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,563
I can't face you ancestors.

211
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:54,964
Let me die.

212
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:56,669
- Let me die...
- Mom.

213
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:57,829
Don't stop me, just where's the wall.

214
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:58,666
Don't!

215
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,568
Mom, it's your second time today.

216
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,870
Well, I have to do something first.

217
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,368
I will go see Tiger Lui tomorrow.

218
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:11,109
I am going to die.

219
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:12,276
Do you want to leave like this?

220
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:14,552
Why don't you save me?

221
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:16,650
You're heartless.

222
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,327
This is for you.

223
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,102
A razor!

224
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:41,675
It's for me!

225
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,041
It's for me to shave my legs.

226
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,746
Mom, it's raining.

227
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:50,419
Let's get an umbrella for your dad.

228
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,514
Yes!

229
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:03,395
Why is it raining so heavily?

230
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,695
Be careful!

231
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,898
Get an umbrella.

232
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,623
Mom, the rain has stopped.

233
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,817
Someone inside.

234
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:29,825
What?

235
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:40,671
Fine, don't cry!

236
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,071
Bastard!

237
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,674
Mom, don't get angry.

238
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:45,540
I don't want to live anymore.

239
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:48,012
Don't be silly.

240
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:50,913
You are pregnant.

241
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,112
They even have a child!

242
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:56,345
Don't worry.

243
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,382
I am responsible.
I will take care of him.

244
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:00,056
We are responsible too.

245
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,319
Bitch! So many men too.

246
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,861
All are involved.

247
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,396
Why should dad take
the responsibility alone?

248
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,535
If Fourth Brother
wasn't trying to save me.

249
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:11,161
Lok Ping wouldn't have lost her husband.

250
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:14,233
And I couldn't bring this list out.

251
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:17,470
Oh, dad is not having a mistress!

252
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:20,240
I am almost scared to death.

253
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,341
Mom, don't cry!

254
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:23,947
Who is it? Come out!

255
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:25,147
Don't go!

256
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:36,194
What kind of noise is it?

257
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:37,630
Firecracker!

258
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:38,789
- Firecracker?
- Yes!

259
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,234
See, you hands are trembling.

260
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:48,065
You don't seem to practise kung-fu.

261
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:53,008
Why did you join the rebels?

262
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,410
We work for different bosses.

263
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:58,046
To you, Chien Lung is good emperor,

264
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:01,348
to us, he isn't.

265
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:03,146
If only you hand me the list,

266
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,921
you will enjoy a prosperous life forever.

267
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:07,625
For my wealth,

268
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:09,059
I'd be giving up thousands of lives.

269
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:11,293
Even I am willing to do so,
my brothers won't let me do it.

270
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:12,428
Even if they are willing,

271
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:13,860
my family won't forgive me.

272
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,058
Of course we will forgive you.

273
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,897
Where is he?

274
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,737
Attack!

275
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:40,650
Dad!

276
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,694
To my mind, my dad is kind-hearted man.

277
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:52,760
So, I want to beat you.

278
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:00,976
Let's go!

279
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:12,488
How dare you bully my husband?
Go to hell!

280
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:27,370
Mom!

281
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,977
Watch mine.

282
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:34,841
Dad, where is the list?

283
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:35,972
Here it is!

284
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,118
No-Shadow Hands.

285
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,671
What are you doing?

286
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,912
Sai Yuk, save Lok Ping.

287
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,212
You mom can handle it.

288
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,918
Be careful!

289
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,829
Miss Lok, how are you?

290
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:33,467
Little hero,
help your dad to protect the list.

291
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,197
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

292
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:36,640
Good-bye!

293
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:37,867
Take care of yourself.

294
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:42,647
Son, we are leaving, take care of here.

295
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:44,946
Don't worry!

296
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:46,508
How dare you join a secret society!

297
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:32,995
It hurts!

298
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:49,036
Come on!

299
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,908
It doesn't hurt!

300
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:53,283
No?!

301
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:58,281
No, not painful indeed?

302
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,283
My dad used to hit me like this.

303
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:17,508
I tell you,

304
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,645
I used to hit my dog like this.

305
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:20,029
Bastard, an inch longer,
an inch stronger.

306
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,506
So, mine is short but powerful!

307
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,843
Where can you do?

308
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,888
See you!

309
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:02,732
Dad!

310
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:04,442
Sai Yuk, are you tailed?

311
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,169
Don't worry,

312
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:06,973
I haven't been
practising kung-fu in vain.

313
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:09,605
Where is mom?

314
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,645
Must have quarreled.

315
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:18,922
Mom, are you alright?

316
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:23,556
He has never treated me
that nicely before.

317
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:28,565
He recited 10 poems for me.

318
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:31,830
10 poems, great!

319
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:34,432
Leave me alone, stop bothering me.

320
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,874
Too smart!

321
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:38,703
How romantic!

322
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:39,767
Sai Yuk!

323
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,309
Dad has chosen his path,

324
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:44,716
so you and mom would have
a hard life from now on.

325
00:22:46,853 --> 00:22:49,117
If I am having a good life alone.

326
00:22:49,322 --> 00:22:51,586
How about the others?

327
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:54,686
Even I wish to do so,
others would object!

328
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:57,588
Even others are willing to do so,
how is my feeling then?

329
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:59,056
But if others...

330
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:02,033
and I agree, so what?

331
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:03,862
No matter what,

332
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,503
your choice is correct.

333
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:07,163
I will go with you all the way.

334
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,837
I don't know what you are talking about,

335
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,467
But l, too, will go along.

336
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:18,943
Since you have made up your mind.

337
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,913
Let's go to find Lui tomorrow.

338
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:22,779
It's dangerous!

339
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,980
The most dangerous place is safest place.

340
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:25,986
I understand!

341
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:32,228
What? You want to move to my home?

342
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:34,698
Right, actually I don't want to do so,

343
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:37,459
but my wife said,
you are a man of virtue.

344
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:40,597
Even my naughty son admires you so much.

345
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:42,404
I want to see for myself.

346
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:43,772
So I agreed to come...

347
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:45,333
and live here for a while.

348
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:48,209
To see how righteous are you.

349
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:52,476
I am a man of righteousness.

350
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,012
So help yourself.

351
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:57,180
I will let you stay
until you admit I am righteous.

352
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:03,321
Miss.

353
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:05,796
Meet your Father and Mother-in-law.

354
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:08,924
Go!

355
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:17,367
Honey, I miss you.

356
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:20,677
But I am not... She is your wife.

357
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:27,384
- It's you!
- It's you!

358
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:35,852
You are thin.

359
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:37,828
You are thin too.

360
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:55,146
Your son is really romantic.

361
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:57,113
It may be inherited.

362
00:24:58,518 --> 00:24:59,485
Come on.

363
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:02,216
What's the matter?

364
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:06,381
This Mirror is our family treasure.

365
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:07,923
It's a present to you.

366
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:09,427
Thank you mom.

367
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:10,757
Thank you mom.

368
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:14,095
Since all of us are here.

369
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,995
Why not take this opportunity,

370
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:18,628
to celebrate their wedding tomorrow.

371
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,596
I am sorry...

372
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,634
It doesn't matter.

373
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,439
I am a man of righteousness.

374
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:29,513
Go ahead, until you think it's enough.

375
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,579
I don't have any friends in Canton.

376
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:35,378
Why not ask your relatives...

377
00:25:35,454 --> 00:25:37,513
to join the wedding party?

378
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,615
Can you ask Tai Yuk to come along too?

379
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:45,629
It doesn't matter,
I am a man of righteousness.

380
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:48,332
I don't mind that!

381
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:50,834
Great!

382
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:52,899
It doesn't matter.

383
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:55,600
Let's rest now.

384
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,472
There will be many guests
coming to our party.

385
00:25:57,543 --> 00:25:59,033
Let's take a good rest
to meet our guests tomorrow.

386
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:02,180
To be a righteous man.

387
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:23,559
Why don't your relatives or friends come?

388
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:29,137
Well, we do have a big family.

389
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:32,410
But they are all over the country
doing business.

390
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:35,572
I can't inform them about the party
in such a short time.

391
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:39,482
But you do have friends here?
Say, friends in the market!

392
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,345
Well, my dear father-in-law.

393
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:46,619
We grow the vegetables ourselves,
we needn't go to the market.

394
00:26:48,427 --> 00:26:49,917
How about rice?

395
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:52,221
We grow our rice too.

396
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:55,197
How about your clients?

397
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:56,594
Aren't they your friends?

398
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:59,231
No, they aren't our friends.

399
00:26:59,305 --> 00:26:59,999
If not,

400
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:01,539
I won't sell them bad cloth.

401
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:02,904
Or I charge them
with unreasonable prices.

402
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:05,671
Selling cloth is more or less
similar to running a brothel.

403
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:07,144
If a client wants to buy,
we are willing to sell.

404
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:09,681
It won't do to become affectionate.

405
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:10,716
So, we don't have friends.

406
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:11,841
Am I right?

407
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:13,248
Perfect!

408
00:27:17,023 --> 00:27:18,991
Master, the Governor.

409
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:21,788
Finally, a guest! Show him in.

410
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:25,220
Don't panic, just the Governor.

411
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:26,989
The Governor!

412
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,590
- Brother Lui.
- Your Excellency!

413
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:29,862
His Honour, the Governor of Kau Mun.

414
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:31,462
Your Honour.

415
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:33,931
- This way please.
- Welcome...

416
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:38,577
Let's meet our guest together.

417
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,703
Come!

418
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:43,576
Your Honour, this way please.

419
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,879
Welcome...

420
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:49,680
Your Honour, my son-in-law,

421
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:51,288
and his family.

422
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:53,484
Take a seat, please.

423
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:55,156
This way please.

424
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,418
Good-bye!

425
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:03,598
Take a seat!

426
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,068
Your Honour!

427
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:08,196
Why are you sitting there?

428
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:09,571
Come and sit with us.

429
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:11,269
No, I think it's too crowded.

430
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:13,334
We'd better sit here.

431
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:16,441
Bull shit, join us.

432
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:17,482
Come on...

433
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,245
I dropped my money.

434
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:20,979
Where is it, let me help you.

435
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,448
Mister Fong, don't sit alone.

436
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:24,953
Come over...

437
00:28:27,193 --> 00:28:28,455
Where is the money?

438
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,391
I can't find it.

439
00:28:36,302 --> 00:28:37,360
When did you come?

440
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:40,200
I have just come over.

441
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:42,897
What is your son-in-law doing?

442
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,467
What are you doing? Get up!

443
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,775
The meat you love is coming.

444
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:55,717
Get up!

445
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:00,625
Mom,

446
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,354
towards you right.

447
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:11,158
Is he your son-in-law?

448
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,301
Mr. Lui,

449
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:14,234
didn't you tell His Honour
you are related?

450
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:16,334
Fong Sai Yuk is my son-in-law.

451
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,066
So, you are the one in-charged here?

452
00:29:18,244 --> 00:29:20,769
Sure, I am the one in-charged here.

453
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,244
Give me the list!

454
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:23,542
Husband! Be careful!

455
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:26,309
Siu Wan!

456
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:27,953
Mom!

457
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:29,212
Ting Ting!

458
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:30,454
Where is the name list?

459
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,463
I am going to kill you.

460
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:47,702
Mom!

461
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,064
Let's fight!

462
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:52,407
Go!

463
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,603
Siu Wan...

464
00:29:56,415 --> 00:29:58,246
Master, be careful!

465
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:11,357
- Go!
- Yes!

466
00:30:22,474 --> 00:30:23,839
Take it back!

467
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:25,943
Burn the house.

468
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:34,947
Damn it. You son of a bitch!

469
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:36,951
I marry my daughter to you,

470
00:30:37,022 --> 00:30:39,081
but you get my whole family into trouble.

471
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:43,522
Mr. Lui, it's not the fault
of young master.

472
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:45,720
Cut the crap, or I will kill you.

473
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,762
Let him go, or else...

474
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,731
You want to fight?

475
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:52,767
What do you want?

476
00:30:52,838 --> 00:30:54,032
Young master, forget it.

477
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,632
Dad, mom's hurt bad.

478
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:58,107
Damn!

479
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:00,804
Siu Wan!

480
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:04,115
- Ting Ting!
- Mom!

481
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:05,411
Where is your dad?

482
00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:09,420
Siu Wan, are you alright?

483
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:11,285
Hurry up...

484
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:12,324
Do you need a doctor?

485
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,986
I know what to do.

486
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:18,161
Leave me alone.

487
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,490
Don't touch her!

488
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:21,925
No! She is seriously hurt!

489
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,298
Siu Wan. Let's go!

490
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:24,028
Be careful!

491
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:25,263
Do you want me...

492
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:26,361
to take you to the doctor?

493
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:27,769
Save the crocodile tears.

494
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,205
Let's go our separate way from now on.

495
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:30,765
Dad, don't do that.

496
00:31:30,943 --> 00:31:32,501
You are a stranger around here.

497
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:34,003
Are you leaving?

498
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,740
If not, you're no longer my daughter.

499
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:37,141
Ting Ting!

500
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,513
Go!

501
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,681
Go! Go now!

502
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:45,555
Sai Yuk, I feel so lost.

503
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,690
Mom, don't worry!

504
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:50,953
While the list is with us.

505
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:52,662
They won't do anything to dad.

506
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:54,357
I am going to town.

507
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:55,756
Be careful!

508
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:11,611
Sing!

509
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:12,548
Who is it?

510
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:13,915
Sai Yuk.

511
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:16,445
open the door now.

512
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:20,722
Come in!

513
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:24,561
I have seen the notice...

514
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,120
that my dad would be executed tomorrow.

515
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:28,565
Many people were caught because of us.

516
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,200
I come to see whether you are okay.

517
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:38,038
I am fine...

518
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,468
What's wrong?

519
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:44,749
Sai Yuk, I am sorry.

520
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,809
Sing, what'd happened?

521
00:32:49,455 --> 00:32:52,356
Some officer took Bo and me
for questioning.

522
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,059
I said...

523
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:57,152
I didn't know you.

524
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,561
Where is Tai Bo?

525
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:06,465
He said I was a crowed.

526
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:09,666
He refused saying that
he didn't know you.

527
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:11,969
So he was beaten up.

528
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:13,739
The officers are tired,

529
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,372
they wanted Bo to kau-tow
before releasing him.

530
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:18,040
Bo refused.

531
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:19,982
Where is he now?

532
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:22,879
He was beaten to death.

533
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:25,248
And his corpse is
hanging at the East Gate.

534
00:33:27,526 --> 00:33:30,461
Sai Yuk, forgive me.

535
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:32,887
I am scared.

536
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:35,089
I won't blame you.

537
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,464
I lost a friend,

538
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:38,002
I don't want to lose you.

539
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:46,469
Who is it?

540
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,938
What are you doing?

541
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:50,812
I came to collect his corpse.

542
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:52,644
Who are you? How dare you?

543
00:33:56,622 --> 00:33:58,180
Fong Sai Yuk.

544
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,955
Fong Sai Yuk?

545
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,890
How dare you come here?

546
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:06,088
My friend is not afraid of death.

547
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,699
How can I be a coward?

548
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:12,470
I have come for his corpse.

549
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:13,835
- Attack.
- Yes!

550
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:47,099
Bo, let's fight together.

551
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:32,976
Kau-tau 3 times to my friend.

552
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:39,686
Please forgive us.

553
00:35:52,938 --> 00:35:55,099
Bo, let's go.

554
00:35:59,945 --> 00:36:03,039
Let us go!

555
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:32,635
Bo, you are my best friend.

556
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:35,874
Hope we'd be buddies in our next lives.

557
00:36:40,085 --> 00:36:42,849
Young master, don't be so sad.

558
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:47,148
Macu, dad will be executed tomorrow.

559
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:50,988
What?

560
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:52,857
I must to save dad alone.

561
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:55,158
You take mom and leave early
tomorrow morning.

562
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:58,567
How can you go alone?

563
00:36:58,637 --> 00:36:59,399
It's too dangerous.

564
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:00,938
Enough!

565
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:02,132
I have made up my mind.

566
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:05,275
Never let mom know this.

567
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:10,046
Macu...

568
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:11,374
Don't cry.

569
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:13,214
Let's go back,

570
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:15,685
mom is waiting for us.

571
00:37:20,892 --> 00:37:22,325
Do you have any information
about your dad?

572
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:24,485
He'll be fine, don't worry.

573
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:26,026
Dad was rescued by Chan,

574
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:28,828
the Head of the Read Flower Society.

575
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,992
Really?

576
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:32,366
I won't cheat you.

577
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:34,235
Why didn't he come back?

578
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,929
Mr. Chan said,

579
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,904
it's not wise to stay together.

580
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,875
He'll meet you and Macu
at Puishi Beach tomorrow morning.

581
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:48,580
Isn't there a branch of
the Red Flower Society at Puishi Beach?

582
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:51,279
You dumb-bell, answer mom now.

583
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:54,993
Right, I went with Old Master a year ago.

584
00:37:55,427 --> 00:37:57,156
What about you?

585
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:02,633
Mr. Chan asked me to take
this name list to Long Fu Hill.

586
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:03,859
And hand it to a Mister Chiu.

587
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:06,130
Are there any Mister Chiu
in Long Fu Hill?

588
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:08,263
Speak up...

589
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,138
Right, a year ago,
I met him once with Old Master.

590
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:12,676
We dined together.

591
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:15,406
He is a nice guy.

592
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:17,175
Am I right?

593
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:19,240
You are right!

594
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:21,742
Well, I don't have to worry anymore.

595
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,811
Go to hell!

596
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,790
Damn you Cantonese Bastards!

597
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:33,353
They say they'll fetch me the doctor.

598
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:35,992
But they told officers
to come and arrest me.

599
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:40,601
You Cantonese, all are bastards.

600
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:43,841
How are you?

601
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:47,509
Ting Ting...

602
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:50,609
I'm fine.

603
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:51,808
It's pouring get on board first.

604
00:38:51,883 --> 00:38:54,875
I won't get on your boat!

605
00:38:54,953 --> 00:38:57,717
I warn you, don't come to my side.

606
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:59,017
Dad!

607
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:00,581
Shut up!

608
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,183
Ting Ting.

609
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:03,794
She is seriously hurt,

610
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:05,227
why don't you help her to the boat?

611
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:08,656
Ting, go with them!

612
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:14,036
I'll stay here to keep your dad company.

613
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,598
Don't be proud at a time like this.

614
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,774
Damn it, you've said enough!

615
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:22,907
I said I would not go with you.

616
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:26,576
But I didn't say my family wouldn't.

617
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:28,285
Help her up.

618
00:39:30,322 --> 00:39:31,550
Be careful!

619
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:33,554
Take care!

620
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,752
Take good care!

621
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:40,730
Take care of here!

622
00:39:40,899 --> 00:39:42,127
Take care.

623
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,401
My God, what the hell did I do wrong?

624
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:55,273
Why do you treat me like this?

625
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,247
The Gods are punishing you for your sins.

626
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:01,842
I ask you once more,
are you getting into the boat?

627
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,615
No...

628
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:05,283
Hold it!

629
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:07,416
Mom...

630
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:11,360
Sai Yuk, take Ting Ting out for a while.

631
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:16,227
I want to talk with your mother.

632
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:20,467
Go now!

633
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:27,276
Madam, I have one thing to ask you.

634
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,908
What's the matter?

635
00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:37,618
Where is Tai Yuk?

636
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:44,492
He is back!

637
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:57,466
"The Beauty pulls the curtain up."

638
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:04,847
"She sits with furrowed brows."

639
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:08,917
"One sees the stains of tears."

640
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,545
"Who is she crying for?"

641
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:15,291
Madam, it's me.

642
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:17,258
Tai Yuk!

643
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:19,988
Are you Tai Yuk?

644
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,228
Yes!

645
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,813
Tai Yuk, we can't live
together in this life.

646
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:43,681
But we'll be husband and wife
in the next life, yes?

647
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,749
Fine!

648
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,736
Madam!

649
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:07,869
Mom!

650
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:10,779
Siu Wan!

651
00:42:17,656 --> 00:42:19,146
Although you scold me all day.

652
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:22,392
I am not angry with you.

653
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:26,125
you'd be my father-in-law now,

654
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:29,265
you'd be my father-in-law for life.

655
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,500
When you reach Puishi Beach tomorrow.

656
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:36,234
The officers can never get you.

657
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,649
Siu Wan!

658
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:05,935
Siu Wan!

659
00:43:30,862 --> 00:43:32,295
After finish your mission,

660
00:43:32,464 --> 00:43:34,455
come and join us.

661
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,630
Young Master. Take care.

662
00:43:38,837 --> 00:43:41,032
Macu, why are you crying?

663
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,801
He's just going to deliver the name list.
He is not going to die.

664
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:46,507
I have caught a cold.

665
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,139
Cut the crap!

666
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:50,842
Hurry up, dad is waiting.

667
00:43:51,182 --> 00:43:52,206
Yes!

668
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:56,378
- Sai Yuk!
- What's the matter?

669
00:43:58,423 --> 00:43:59,788
Can you swear?

670
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:01,185
What?

671
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,960
Swear you'd never marry me.

672
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:07,420
Why?

673
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,924
Remember our bridal night?

674
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:10,933
What?

675
00:44:11,002 --> 00:44:14,130
You swore that if marry me,
your family'd...

676
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:16,772
Would all die, I remembered.

677
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,570
No matter what happens,

678
00:44:21,646 --> 00:44:23,705
I will marry you.

679
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:32,548
My husband used to kiss me like this.

680
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:36,157
Did your wife kiss you like this before?

681
00:44:37,862 --> 00:44:39,193
Forget I said anything.

682
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:40,731
Jabber.

683
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:44,163
Wear this!

684
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:45,361
How about you?

685
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:48,801
I have this.

686
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:51,467
- You take this along!
- It's time to leave.

687
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:53,369
Take care.

688
00:45:02,554 --> 00:45:05,717
Sai Yuk, take care!

689
00:45:07,826 --> 00:45:10,124
Take a horse.

690
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:11,856
It's better than walking on foot.

691
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,195
Beware of catching cold.

692
00:45:15,366 --> 00:45:16,697
Take some food!

693
00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:26,905
You take care too.

694
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:11,687
I just want the traitors of
the Red Flower Society.

695
00:46:12,357 --> 00:46:15,815
Give me the name list,
and you will be spared.

696
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:17,885
We Hans won't betray our friends.

697
00:46:17,962 --> 00:46:19,327
If only you Manchus go back to Machuria,

698
00:46:19,397 --> 00:46:20,830
we won't go against you.

699
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:24,491
The Ching government
has ruled over China for generations.

700
00:46:25,336 --> 00:46:28,794
But you still refuse to face facts.

701
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:30,871
Look,

702
00:46:30,942 --> 00:46:36,676
our country is stable and prosperous!

703
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:39,308
Listen?

704
00:46:39,484 --> 00:46:40,542
Shut up!

705
00:46:40,952 --> 00:46:43,284
Death to whoever make a noise.

706
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:47,424
I ask you, where are the men
of the Red Flower Society?

707
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:50,116
When there is air,
there are members of Red Flower Society.

708
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:51,355
How many can you kill?

709
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:54,994
Okay, I will kill as many as I can.

710
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,398
Kill him!

711
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:10,113
How poor!

712
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:19,089
Kill!

713
00:47:23,061 --> 00:47:24,392
Here is the list!

714
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:25,861
Great!

715
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,330
I've become the member
of the Red Flower Society!

716
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:31,626
I'll live and die with the list.

717
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:19,805
Sai Yuk!

718
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:36,063
Don't come over.

719
00:48:36,134 --> 00:48:37,965
Or I'll kill him!

720
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:40,097
Retreat!

721
00:48:40,305 --> 00:48:42,865
You have guts!

722
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:45,405
Aren't you scared?

723
00:48:46,978 --> 00:48:48,912
I am prepared to be killed.

724
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:51,281
Give me the name list,
and you will be spared.

725
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:53,476
then you and your dad will be released.

726
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:57,952
Sai Yuk, don't give it to him.

727
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:03,924
You should know how the wind blows.

728
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:06,487
Just give me the name list.

729
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:10,864
I can guarantee you a prosperous future.

730
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:14,204
Are you bluffing?

731
00:49:14,272 --> 00:49:15,762
My dad won't forgive me,
my mom will kill me.

732
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,273
The citizens will scold me.

733
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:18,442
History will give me a bad name.

734
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:21,205
I won't betray my people!

735
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:24,112
Great!

736
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:29,012
You have guts, I like your kind.

737
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,850
If we are not serving different bosses,

738
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:34,024
we can be friends.

739
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:36,322
I'll give you a chance.

740
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:41,163
If you can defeat me
before the rope breaks,

741
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:43,596
I will let you father go.

742
00:49:43,668 --> 00:49:47,627
If you lose, give me the name list.

743
00:50:42,894 --> 00:50:44,862
I used 30% of my power last time.

744
00:50:45,029 --> 00:50:47,190
I think you are so gifted in kung-fu,

745
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:49,426
that I want to introduce you
to serve our government.

746
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,125
But, I don't think
there is a chance now.

747
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:05,306
I know every kinds of boxing.

748
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:07,710
I want to make you my student.

749
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,244
Since you bullied my dad...

750
00:51:11,322 --> 00:51:12,653
I don't think there is any chance now.

751
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,300
Luckily I am protected by the mirror.

752
00:53:11,642 --> 00:53:13,371
Go to hell!

753
00:53:50,715 --> 00:53:51,773
Take it!

754
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:19,103
Go now!

755
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,903
I won't go!

756
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:23,173
Sai Yuk!

757
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:26,249
I am happy to see you so grown up.

758
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:28,011
Just leave me.

759
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,016
Our country is waiting for you.

760
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:33,346
I feel at ease even if I have to die.

761
00:54:34,091 --> 00:54:35,456
Go now!

762
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,328
What I can do, many people can do too.

763
00:54:38,396 --> 00:54:40,227
But I have one dad.

764
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,796
Sai Yuk, go!

765
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:49,863
Dad, I want to die with you.

766
00:54:55,513 --> 00:54:57,708
Fong Sai Yuk, I am coming to help you!

767
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:02,786
I come to help too!

768
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,349
Use some force!

769
00:55:27,845 --> 00:55:29,437
"Fuck you!"

770
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:31,813
Kill them!

771
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:37,510
Husband!

772
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,814
Sai Yuk!

773
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:43,419
Mom is here to save you!

774
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:59,368
You foolish kid.
How dare you leave mom alone?

775
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,410
I want to help too!

776
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:03,444
Macu, why did you bring mom here?

777
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:04,412
I didn't.

778
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:05,744
There is a branch of the
Red Flower Society at the Puishi Beach!

779
00:56:05,816 --> 00:56:06,475
What a coincidence.

780
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,384
Your big mouth is an oracle.

781
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,512
Take care of dad.

782
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,813
Go to hell!

783
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:23,124
Go to hell! Why don't you die?

784
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:25,533
Why don't you die?

785
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,036
Mister Chan!

786
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:53,796
Husband, are you alright?

787
00:56:53,864 --> 00:56:55,331
I am fine, Save dad!

788
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:57,222
Dad!

789
00:56:57,768 --> 00:56:59,258
Save dad.

790
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:06,470
Go now!

791
00:57:19,757 --> 00:57:22,988
Mister Chan, you are really great.

792
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:25,061
I admire you so much.

793
00:57:27,465 --> 00:57:29,695
But, my master said,

794
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:31,428
I have to bring you corpse back.

795
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,035
Super shoes!

796
00:57:42,346 --> 00:57:43,836
Watch mine!

797
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:52,547
Mom!

798
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:05,562
Brother Fong,
I will take Sai Yuk as my God-son.

799
00:58:05,636 --> 00:58:06,660
I will train him in Kung-fu too.

800
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:09,205
Thank you, Master Chan.
I leave my son to you.

801
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:10,335
Mister Damn!

802
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,499
Sorry!

803
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:12,405
Master Chan!

804
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:14,203
Take care of him please!

805
00:58:14,278 --> 00:58:15,870
You have never left me
since you were a child.

806
00:58:17,214 --> 00:58:19,842
Master, we've to say good-bye!

807
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:20,812
God father,

808
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:22,418
may I take Ting Ting with me?

809
00:58:22,486 --> 00:58:23,316
Sure you can.

810
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:24,954
Are you willing...

811
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:26,512
to let your son join the triads?

812
00:58:27,057 --> 00:58:28,388
What do you think?

813
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:30,954
Fine, just as you say.

814
00:58:31,262 --> 00:58:32,456
Ting Ting, let's go.

815
00:58:34,965 --> 00:58:35,954
Dad!

816
00:58:37,835 --> 00:58:39,359
Sai Yuk, don't bully my daughter.

817
00:58:39,537 --> 00:58:41,061
Or, I will beat you.

818
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:43,163
Don't worry, I won't bully her.

819
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,071
You should take me as an example.

820
00:58:45,242 --> 00:58:46,470
To be a man of virtuous persuasion.

821
00:58:46,544 --> 00:58:47,704
Yes Sir!

822
00:58:50,281 --> 00:58:50,906
Dad!

823
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:52,278
May I beg you for one thing?

824
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:53,611
What?

825
00:58:53,684 --> 00:58:55,447
I've never seen you smile!

826
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:56,779
Can you smile for me once?

827
00:58:57,154 --> 00:58:58,212
Make it next year.

828
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:02,121
Sai Yuk, follow me.

829
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:04,956
Dad, you'd take care.

830
00:59:05,195 --> 00:59:06,184
Let's go!

831
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:09,129
Sai Yuk, take care!

832
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,365
You'll be good to me, won't you?

833
00:59:11,535 --> 00:59:12,797
"The beauty put up the curtain."

834
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,562
"She sits with furrowed brows."

835
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:16,003
"Only stains of her tears are seen."

836
00:59:16,073 --> 00:59:17,631
"Who is she hating?"

837
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:23,307
Son, you dad laughs!

838
00:59:23,747 --> 00:59:26,875
How romantic. I am so happy!

839
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:34,180
You've forgotten something! Catch it!

840
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:38,520
"Red Flower Society Name List"
