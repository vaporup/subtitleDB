1
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,840
<i>Hey, Aron here.</i>

2
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
<i>Leave a message.</i>

3
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,480
<i>Hey Aron.</i>

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,280
<i>Sonja here... again.</i>

5
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,640
<i>I know that you're probably gonna do</i>
<i>ways this week-end,</i>

6
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,680
<i>but listen, just think about</i>
<i>what we're gonna play, please,</i>

7
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,120
<i>'coz we have to decide</i>
<i>and we really need to practice.</i>

8
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>Anyway, it'll be fun, I promise.</i>

9
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,160
<i>And, oh! Please call mom,</i>
<i>please 'coz she worries.</i>

10
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
<i>Which, you know, all right...</i>

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,120
<i>Later, A. Bye!</i>

12
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
It's Friday night!

13
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,040
April 25th, 2003.

14
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,720
I'm just heading to Canyonlands

15
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,560
Just me, the music

16
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
and the night!

17
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Love it!

18
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,440
Blue John Canyon,

19
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,200
guide book says:

20
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,880
"1 h 30 min
to the Big Dropper."

21
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
I am to take 45 mins of that.

22
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,280
You're doing Blue John, too, huh?

23
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,280
No. Actually,
we're headed for the Dome.

24
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,040
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

25
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Hang on.

26
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,880
Oh, my God!

27
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,280
Let's see this.

28
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,880
You are... here.

29
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
We are?

30
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,520
- And...
- I knew that.

31
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,120
And, the Dome, is there.

32
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,640
I can take you that way if you like.

33
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
Sorry the...
Friday the 13th there.

34
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,280
Child killer look.

35
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm only a psychopath on week days
and today is saturday, so...

36
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,000
Can't take this off... My face.

37
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Nice!

38
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,240
Aron.

39
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Kristi.

40
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,640
Allow me to introduce you
to my friend Megan.

41
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,400
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

42
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,640
What do you say?

43
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,680
You're lost, I'm a guide...

44
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Feel good.

45
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
Why not.

46
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,640
- Sure.
- All right.

47
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
This way.

48
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,040
So you bike from Horseshoe.

49
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,400
Is that like 20 miles ?

50
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,640
17 on the odometer.

51
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,400
I thought it was 17.2!

52
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,040
17.3, actually.

53
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,560
You're one of those...

54
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,760
- I'm not one of those.
- You spend a lot of time out here?

55
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,560
That's my second home.

56
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,800
See?

57
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,520
There's the fork, right there.

58
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,680
We totally missed that.

59
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,000
Glad we bumped into you.

60
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

61
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Exactly.

62
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
You go to the one place in America
you guaranteed not to run into a weirdo.

63
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,120
And what happen?!

64
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,920
All right.

65
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,880
So the guide book says

66
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,520
that the route's through here.

67
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,640
But I know a better way.

68
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,760
The cool way.

69
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,280
Guaranteed, best time you can have
with your clothes on.

70
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Although, it's better
with your clothes off.

71
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
It is a bit of a climb.

72
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,520
- We climb!
- And a bit of a squeeze.

73
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
We squeeze.

74
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,360
So you get us

75
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,480
all the way back in here,

76
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
and then you tell us
that you're not a guide.

77
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,400
Well no, I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really wanna do.

78
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,520
That's wonderful to hear.

79
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,000
I've always wanted to be a supermodel

80
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,240
but I don't think that's actually
gonna workout, you know?

81
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,280
Jesus!
What if these things move?

82
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,280
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

83
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,560
- Sure they will!
- What?!

84
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,120
Everything is moving all the time.
Let's just hope not today!

85
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Great.

86
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
All right.

87
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
Now, all you got to remember

88
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
is that everything will be okay.

89
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,880
Oh, my God!

90
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,760
- Oh, my God!
- Aron?

91
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
Are you okay?

92
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Aron?

93
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,040
Listen to the guy, he is fine.

94
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Yeah.

95
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
He's bad shit.

96
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
You're bad shit!

97
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,400
Come on!

98
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
You've got to come down here!

99
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,480
Trust me!

100
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,920
- Trust you? We'll kill you Aron!
- Oh, please.

101
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,520
You love this.

102
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Nice job!

103
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,400
- Megan, you're missing it!
- Come on, it's amazing!

104
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
- Oh, fuck, fuck.
- Just jump, Megan.

105
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,160
Fuck!

106
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
You okay?

107
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,040
- Nice job!
- I can't believe you did it!

108
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,320
- Okay, we have to do it again!
- Again?

109
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,280
Camera, camera!

110
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,400
So, Blue John,

111
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,920
is actually named after
this guy Blue John

112
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
who was Butch Cassidy's cook.

113
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,440
<i>From Butch Cassidy</i>
<i>and the Sundace Kid.</i>

114
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,040
And they would hide out
in these Canyons, I guess.

115
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
But also what they do
is they run wild horses into here

116
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,440
and they trap them
at the end of the Canyon.

117
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
That's how they caught the horses.

118
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,320
- One more picture before I go?
- Yeah!

119
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,320
Okay, cool.

120
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Ready?

121
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,560
One, two, three...

122
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,560
Blue John, blue cheese...
Well, will I ever see you again?

123
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,680
That depends. Do you party?

124
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
Do I party? Yeah, sometimes.

125
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,720
Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party
if you wanna come.

126
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,800
You should come by
and have a bear. Kick back.

127
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,200
Okay, where am I going?

128
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,680
It's about 20 miles away,
near Green River behind the old motel.

129
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,680
It's behind that. There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

130
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Really? Okay.

131
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,280
- Cool!
- Okay!

132
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,920
It was good to met you.

133
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
- See ya!
- Bye!

134
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,600
Scooby-Doo!

135
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,040
Rock on!

136
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,320
You think he's gonna show up?

137
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,080
I don't think
we figured in his day at all.

138
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,040
You liked him!

139
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,320
This is insane!

140
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,800
Move this fucking rock!

141
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,760
Please.

142
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,800
Oh, God.

143
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,120
Kristi!

144
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,360
Megan!

145
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,760
Is there anyone?!

146
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Think.

147
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Just think.

148
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Fuck!

149
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,640
Shit!

150
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,360
Shit!

151
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Fucker!

152
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,560
Sweet!

153
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,200
Knife is dull.

154
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,880
Look at the size of this one, man.
How the fuck did this get here?

155
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Okay.

156
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,200
Hey, buddy.

157
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Here we go.

158
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,240
It's 3:05,

159
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,560
on Sunday, April 26th,

160
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,880
2003.

161
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,680
This marks,

162
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,360
24 hours

163
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,160
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon.

164
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,440
Right where it slots up
before the Big Drop.

165
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,800
My name is Aron Ralston,

166
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,200
my parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado,

167
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,160
and...

168
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,840
Whoever find this
can keep the recorder.

169
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Just...

170
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Please try and get in touch
with my parents and give them this tape.

171
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,960
I'd appreciate it.

172
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,240
I was descending Blue John,

173
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,240
yesterday, when this

174
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
chockstone

175
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,360
came loose and rolled onto my arm

176
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,360
and now it's stuck and...

177
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,600
my thumb has this kind
of this gray-blue color.

178
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,400
It's been without circulation
for 24 hours.

179
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
So...

180
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
I think it's pretty well gone.

181
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
I'm low on food.

182
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,480
That's about... 300-400 ml.

183
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,440
And that's it for water.

184
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm in pretty deep doo here.

185
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,400
Please!

186
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,640
There's someone down here!

187
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,800
Help!

188
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,880
I'm in the Canyon!

189
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
<i>Help!</i>

190
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,040
<i>Help!</i>

191
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,800
<i>Down here!</i>

192
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,760
<i>Help!</i>

193
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,960
Don't loose it.

194
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
Aron,

195
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,520
do not loose it.

196
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Not bad.

197
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Dinner.

198
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,360
<i>Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party</i>
<i>if you wanna come.</i>

199
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
<i>You should come by</i>
<i>and have a bear. Kick back.</i>

200
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,000
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.</i>

201
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,600
Scooby-Doo...

202
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,880
Mountain Dew?

203
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,320
Plastic cup.

204
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,080
Thank you.

205
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,880
Might take a beer as well.

206
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,520
Don't mind if I do?

207
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,000
<i>Aron here.</i>

208
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,200
<i>Leave a message.</i>

209
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,520
<i>Aron, it's mom.</i>

210
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,080
<i>I was hoping to catch you.</i>

211
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,640
<i>Are you there?</i>

212
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,080
<i>Hello?</i>

213
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,600
<i>Okay.</i>

214
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,240
<i>Nothing urgent.</i>

215
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
<i>Dad is in New York,</i>
<i>so it'll be a quiet week-end.</i>

216
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,800
<i>Call me, okay?</i>

217
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,760
<i>Lost of love.</i>

218
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,960
Where are you going?

219
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,480
Don't know yet.

220
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,600
Right there, Brian.

221
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,680
Maybe you tell me
and I'll be somewhere else.

222
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,960
Have a good one.

223
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,160
Always do.

224
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,760
<i>Always do.</i>

225
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
Let's go.

226
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Crap.

227
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,840
This is freaking me out
looking at myself like that.

228
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,360
Sorry, I hope that's okay.

229
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,800
It's Monday.

230
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,360
Bummer, all day.

231
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,400
I tried to set up this pulley

232
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,120
all morning, but it didn't work.

233
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,400
It was worth a try

234
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,880
but there is too much friction
and it's...

235
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,640
a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

236
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,520
What I could really use is
about 20 meters of static rap rope,

237
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,920
9.8 mm.

238
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,320
3 or 4 pulleys,

239
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,800
A rack of carabiners, a sling,

240
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,360
power drill,

241
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,400
and a pull kit.

242
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,320
And 8 burly men
to do all the hawling.

243
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,920
That should just about do it.

244
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
I have...

245
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,720
150 ml of water left.

246
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,160
What should keep me alive till...

247
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,400
Tomorrow night.

248
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,880
If I'm lucky.

249
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,800
I peed twice.

250
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,840
I almost piss my pants.

251
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,040
My body is actually
acting really weird.

252
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,200
The second time,

253
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,200
I did it in the camelback.

254
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,760
It smells really bad.

255
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
But...

256
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,840
I'm sure it'll settle.

257
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,560
It's got to be chilled,
like Sauvignon Blanc.

258
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,560
No number twos.

259
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,640
Which should disappoint
my insect friends.

260
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,160
They'll just have to wait.

261
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,160
Let's, see.
What else could I tell you?

262
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,120
There is this raven

263
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,160
that comes every morning.

264
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,200
I clocked it at 8:17.

265
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,560
I'll film it for you tomorrow.

266
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,320
Every morning at

267
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,320
9:30.

268
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,200
I get fifteen minutes of sunlight.

269
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,880
Really nice.

270
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,680
I've been chipping away.

271
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
More to...

272
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,680
More to keep warm than anything.

273
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,840
And I'm beginning to think
that my hand

274
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,840
is supporting the rock.

275
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,640
So when I chip away a little bit,
it actually settles more.

276
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
So...

277
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,280
I found this great tourniquet.

278
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,000
It hurts.

279
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,120
It hasn't been very useful.

280
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,720
Listen.

281
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,160
Don't buy the cheap

282
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,000
made-in-China multi-tool.

283
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,600
I tried to find
my Swiss Army knife, but...

284
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,560
This thing came free
with a flashlight.

285
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,280
The flashlight
was a piece of shit too.

286
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,120
I kept it in my truck
for emergencies.

287
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,120
Not that I'm blaming you, mom.

288
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,240
It was a...

289
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,240
perfectly great stocking stuffer.

290
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,560
There is no way you could have known
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

291
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,240
So you have to leave the camera to us
if we want to watch what you've made.

292
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
- Yeah.
- Good job, hon.

293
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,240
So he's filming her now.

294
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,760
And we see it there, live.

295
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,120
Well done, okay.

296
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,680
Way to go, sis.

297
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,400
<i>- Keep playing?</i>
- Yes, honey, keep going.

298
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,080
Fuck!

299
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,040
So...

300
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,760
How do I get in?

301
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,920
What's the...

302
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,720
you know...

303
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,840
combination?

304
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,960
If I told you,

305
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,200
I'd have to kill you.

306
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,400
You've already kill me.

307
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,320
Combination?

308
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,200
I think I have it.

309
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,680
Fuck.

310
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,520
Who's there?

311
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Aron?

312
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
Please!

313
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,120
Please!

314
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,320
Please!

315
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,800
<i>- Good morning every body...</i>
<i>- It's the morning show...</i>

316
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,640
Good morning everyone!

317
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,960
It is seven o'clock here,
in Canyonlands, U.S.A.

318
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,080
And this morning, on the boulder,

319
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,640
we have a very special guest,

320
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,240
self-proclaimed American super hero...

321
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,200
Aron Ralston!

322
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,480
Let's hear it for Aron!

323
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,640
Hi, oh, gosh, it's...

324
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,480
It's a real pleasure to be here,
thank you.

325
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
Thank you.

326
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,760
Hey, can I say "hi"
to my mom and dad?

327
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,280
Mom and dad?
Mustn't forget mom and dad, right Aron?

328
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,920
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,520
Hey mom. I'm really sorry I...

330
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,920
I didn't answered the phone
the other night...

331
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,720
If I had I would have told you
where I was going an then...

332
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,800
I probably
wouldn't be here right now.

333
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,480
That's for sure!

334
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,800
But like I always say:

335
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,080
"Your supreme selfishness

336
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,200
"is our gain."

337
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,800
Thank you Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say "hi" to ?

338
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,440
- Brian, at work.
- Hi, Aron.

339
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,440
I probably won't be making it
in to work today.

340
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,160
Get a load of this guy!
Oh, wait, hold on.

341
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,800
We've got a question coming in

342
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,640
from another Aron,

343
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,640
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

344
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,160
Aron asks:

345
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,320
Am I right in thinking

346
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,240
even if Brian from work

347
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,640
notifies the police,
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it

348
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,720
before they file
a missing persons report,

349
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,000
which means
you won't become officially missing

350
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,320
until midday Wednesday
at the earliest?

351
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,720
Yeah, you're right
on the money there, Aron.

352
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,680
Which means,
I'll probably be dead by then.

353
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,400
Aron, from Loser Canyon, Utah,
how do you know so much?

354
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,160
Well, I'll tell you
how I know so much.

355
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
I volunteer
for the rescue service.

356
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,400
You see, I'm some kind of a...

357
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,600
well, a big fucking heart hero.

358
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,280
And I can do

359
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,640
everything on my own, you see?

360
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,000
I do see!

361
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,240
Now...

362
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,880
Is it true

363
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,800
that despite,

364
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:55,600
or maybe because
you're a big fucking heart hero,

365
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,960
you didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

366
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,240
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

367
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:07,840
Anyone?

368
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,320
Anyone.

369
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,000
Mom, dad,

370
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,880
I just wanna take this time
to tell you that

371
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,920
the time we spent together
was awesome.

372
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,480
And I haven't appreciated you
in my heart as I know that I could.

373
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Mom,

374
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,000
I love you.

375
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,880
And I wish that I had returned
all your calls, ever.

376
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,720
I love you, guys.

377
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,760
And I'll always be with you.

378
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,520
This is no Slurpee.

379
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,960
It's like a bag of piss.

380
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,160
<i>I'm going again!</i>

381
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,040
<i>With clothes on.</i>

382
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,280
<i>- Megan, tell him.</i>
<i>- We're very worried about you.</i>

383
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,240
<i>We're worried</i>
<i>about your musical choices.</i>

384
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,560
<i>If you keep singing Phish</i>
<i>you'll never get a girlfriend.</i>

385
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,920
<i>You might have one,</i>
<i>but I really don't think you do.</i>

386
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,920
<i>- You may be sort of cute.</i>
<i>- Occasions are scarce for you.</i>

387
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,360
<i>Okay.</i>

388
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,440
<i>This canon ball is for you.</i>

389
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,840
<i>I'm going to...</i>

390
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,040
<i>I'm going to test your theory</i>
<i>about whether or not it's better</i>

391
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,680
<i>to do it without your clothes on.</i>

392
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,160
Don't...

393
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,480
Don't...

394
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,200
<i>Ralston, rock on.</i>

395
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,720
You don't even want me here, do you?

396
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,320
I'm gonna go, Aron.

397
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,160
Is that what you want?

398
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,200
It is, isn't it?

399
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,720
Okay.

400
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,360
Come back.

401
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,120
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

402
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,400
<i>46, 47, 48...</i>

403
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,640
<i>49, 50! Aron, I'm coming!</i>

404
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,880
I'm holding on.

405
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,200
Time is moving really slowly.

406
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,160
My heart is beating really fast.

407
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,280
I swear to God, it feels like

408
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,640
it's beating like three times faster
than it should be.

409
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,960
So cold...

410
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,120
Blue John?

411
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,680
<i>You...</i>

412
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,240
Rana,

413
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,480
- I've been thinking about you girl.
<i>- I've been thinking about you girl.</i>

414
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,720
<i>I know how I am.</i>
<i>I tried to do everything.</i>

415
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,360
<i>How I was...</i>

416
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,600
<i>I tried.</i>

417
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,360
What you guys are doing here?

418
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:40,920
Eddy?

419
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,560
Tom?

420
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,400
Hey, guys. What's going on?

421
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,520
Eric?

422
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,080
Hey.

423
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,040
You look like the Hole
in the Wall Gang.

424
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,960
Dorks.

425
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,080
Found you, Aron.

426
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,560
Sis,

427
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,400
I'm sorry
that I won't be at your wedding.

428
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,480
I know that I promised to play.

429
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,080
That we play.

430
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,440
I'm sorry.

431
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,040
I know it'll be a good one.

432
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,400
8:15.

433
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,080
there's no raven.

434
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,360
8:20.

435
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,360
I didn't tell you
my raven didn't come.

436
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,720
I've been thinking,

437
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,720
everything is...

438
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,400
It just comes together.

439
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,640
<i>You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.</i>

440
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,160
<i>Always do.</i>

441
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,400
Later!

442
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,680
It's me.

443
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,400
<i>Aron, it's mom.</i>
<i>I was hoping to catch you.</i>

444
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,800
I chose this.

445
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,280
<i>Dad's in New-York,</i>
<i>so it'll be a quiet week-end.</i>

446
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,680
I chose all of this.

447
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,280
Call me, okay?
Lots of love!

448
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,440
This rock,

449
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,560
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

450
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,320
I hate this rock!

451
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,760
In it's entire life.
Ever since it was a bit of meteorite.

452
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,240
A million billion years ago.

453
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,160
Up there in space.
It's been waiting...

454
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,640
to come here.

455
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,680
Right, right here.

456
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,360
I've been moving towards it
my hole life.

457
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,040
The minute I was born

458
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,760
every breath I've taken

459
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,400
every action

460
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,240
has been leading me to this

461
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,560
crack on the out surface.

462
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,440
Come on.

463
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,560
Don't pass out.

464
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,440
Thank you.

465
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,440
Easy.

466
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,640
Help!

467
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,840
Please!

468
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,160
Help me!

469
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,080
I need help!

470
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,880
I need agua...

471
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,920
I'm Aron Ralston.
Since Saturday I was trapped

472
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,680
by a boulder.

473
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,440
No water for 5 days.

474
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,600
I cut my arm off.

475
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,760
Please, some water.

476
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,320
Thank you.

477
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,160
- You've got a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

478
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,080
You should stop and rest.

479
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,240
No, I better keep going.

480
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,600
Can one of you run?

481
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,720
Can one of you run ahead?

482
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,640
{\He met his wife Jessica
three years later.}

483
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,760
{\Aron continues to be
a climber and a Canyoneer.}

484
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:25,200
{\He always leaves a note
to say where he has gone.}
