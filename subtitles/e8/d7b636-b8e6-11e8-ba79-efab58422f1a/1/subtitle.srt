1
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:45,176
<i>And her ambition was to extend her realm...</i>

2
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,470
<i>to all the regions of the known world.</i>

3
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:50,639
<i>To this end, she gathered an army.</i>

4
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:54,601
<i>And she bore a son and named him Nekron.</i>

5
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:59,396
<i>And him she tutored in the black arts
and in the powers of the mind.</i>

6
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,565
<i>And when Nekron came of age...</i>

7
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,401
<i>and attained mastery of those powers...</i>

8
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:09,155
<i>together they seized control
of the region of Ice.</i>

9
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,656
<i>And from their castle called Ice Peak...</i>

10
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,701
<i>they sent a giant glacier
rumbling southward.</i>

11
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:19,455
<i>No village or people could stand
against its relentless onslaught.</i>

12
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:23,333
<i>And so the remnants of humanity
fled south...</i>

13
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,377
<i>and huddled for warmth
among the volcanoes...</i>

14
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:31,090
<i>of a mountain region
ruled by a generous king named Jarol...</i>

15
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:34,759
<i>from his fortress,
which men called Fire Keep.</i>

16
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:39,013
<i>And still Nekron
pushed the Ice ever southward...</i>

17
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:42,975
<i>into the temperate zone toward Fire Keep.</i>

18
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:46,478
<i>And no one dared guess at the outcome...</i>

19
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,606
<i>of a meeting on the field of battle...</i>

20
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,816
<i>between Fire and Ice.</i>

21
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:29,639
Hold your positions, men. Steady.

22
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,944
Lam, it cannot be stopped.
Join your brother.

23
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,975
You have done well, my son.

24
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:03,354
The North Village has fallen. We have won.

25
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:06,022
I want to thank you, Mother.

26
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,610
The Great Plain is all that stands
between ourselves and Fire Keep.

27
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:13,237
That is a long distance.

28
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,656
A distance we may not have to travel.

29
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:21,202
I am sending our envoys to Jarol
with our new demands.

30
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:24,247
- He will not submit.
- Perhaps.

31
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:28,375
You will present our demands to King Jarol
at Fire Keep and...

32
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:32,212
give our royal regards
to his lovely daughter.

33
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:59,157
But, Father, I want to be with you
when you meet Nekron's men.

34
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,534
You will serve your people better here
with your studies, my daughter.

35
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:03,993
Give me your love.

36
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,164
You have it always, Father.

37
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,346
All matter in our world
is from the natural bases...

38
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:29,807
which are earth, air, fire and water.

39
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,687
The four elements
from which all things are created.

40
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:40,858
How can you talk about elements
when the war draws nearer to us ever hour?

41
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:44,528
Princess Teegra, we all have our duty.

42
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:47,238
Your father's duty is to be king and lead.

43
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:52,452
Your brother's duty is to soldier.
And your duty is to learn.

44
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:55,912
You mean my duty is to stay shut up...

45
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:59,374
while all the men do the fighting
and share all the glory.

46
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,086
We think that stinks.

47
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,546
Don't we, Shaitan?

48
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:10,633
If you peacefully surrender, my lord Nekron
will cease the destruction of...

49
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,302
This is your message of peace?

50
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,430
A demand for our total
and unconditional surrender?

51
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:19,182
We call it an offer of alliance, Your Majesty.

52
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,184
I call it blackmail.

53
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,102
My lord Nekron's offer...

54
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:27,565
To hell with Nekron and his offer.
We are free men, not slaves.

55
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:31,192
King Jarol, be reasonable.

56
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:35,446
My son, Taro, speaks more with his heart
than with his head.

57
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:37,323
But he speaks for all of us.

58
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:39,283
There can be no alliance.

59
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,743
We will fight you to the death.

60
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:46,247
Perhaps, you will soon change your mind.

61
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:38,583
No!

62
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,276
Teegra!

63
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:10,235
Guards!

64
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:27,166
Make for the glacier. Man the Dragonhawks.

65
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,252
Hurry!

66
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,313
The Dragonhawks will find her, Father.
They've got to.

67
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:57,984
The night's so dark, the jungle so thick.
A bird couldn't find its own nest.

68
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,281
- What do we do then, Father?
- We wait.

69
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,992
- For Nekron's new demands?
- For his siege!

70
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,603
<i>What is your report?
Have you done as I commanded?</i>

71
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:54,691
<i>Have you captured the girl, Teegra,
Jarol's daughter?</i>

72
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,151
<i>Where is she?</i>

73
00:25:57,652 --> 00:26:00,195
<i>Bring her forth that I may see her.</i>

74
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:03,114
<i>- Gone.
- Gone?</i>

75
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,575
<i>Gone!</i>

76
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:09,203
<i>Escaped? You filth-spawned scum!</i>

77
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:16,876
<i>What punishment does failure demand?</i>

78
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,712
Death.

79
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:35,350
<i>Find the girl.
Find her, or his punishment shall be yours.</i>

80
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:09,522
Gods of my father.

81
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:16,422
What do you want?

82
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:32,519
If you want it, take it.

83
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,400
I am not a thief.

84
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:22,196
Not so close, you'll burn it.

85
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:24,739
I've always lived close to a fire.

86
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:32,455
Sometimes in the night, I'm so afraid.

87
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,680
It's getting colder.

88
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:06,234
- Cold comes from Nekron.
- I know.

89
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:20,745
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home to my people.

90
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:27,085
- Where is home?
- Far away, to the south.

91
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:30,295
- I'm going south, too.
- Yeah?

92
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:33,381
You can come along if you behave yourself.

93
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,425
If I behave myself?

94
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:40,346
No.

95
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:25,343
Larn.

96
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:16,354
You've caught me,
but you'll never hand me over to Nekron.

97
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:18,355
You'll have to kill me first.

98
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,694
Don't hunt for death, boy.

99
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,113
It finds us all soon enough.

100
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:38,456
The travois was to keep you
from killing yourself till you're all healed.

101
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:41,750
You need rest and food.

102
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:52,550
If you're gonna kill the Ice Lord, boy,
you better learn to live with pain.

103
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:59,515
Ice Lord? You mean you're fighting Nekron?

104
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,391
Him and his mother.

105
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,894
That wolf bitch, Juliana.

106
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:18,615
Teegra!

107
00:38:21,492 --> 00:38:23,077
They were here.

108
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:25,912
Nekron's dogs, they got the girl.

109
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:28,748
They took her west.

110
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:40,592
Guard Teegra.

111
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:24,295
They camped less than two miles from here.

112
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:25,505
Come.

113
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:57,384
I saw the girl before.
She is on the far side of the big tree.

114
00:41:58,968 --> 00:42:01,804
You go get her out,
and I'll distract the others.

115
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:05,933
- There must be 50 of them.
- That sounds about right.

116
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:35,300
- Where's the girl?
- I couldn't find her.

117
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:02,740
- No!
- The horses!

118
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:05,660
No, they'd be on our heels
before we could reach them.

119
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:08,954
- But Teegra's still back there.
- Then we'll come back for her.

120
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:11,664
First, we lead the Nekron's dogs
on a wild chase.

121
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:12,791
Come.

122
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,170
We'll take our stand up there. Come.

123
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,594
Enough!

124
00:45:16,428 --> 00:45:19,264
I want you to go to Nekron,
to his mother, Juliana.

125
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:22,934
- We must negotiate.
- With the enemy?

126
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:25,394
No man is wholly evil.

127
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:27,687
Surely there is some way
to appeal to Nekron.

128
00:45:27,771 --> 00:45:29,356
You expect his mercy?

129
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:34,652
Father, do you know what he will do
if I enter his land under a flag of truce?

130
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:36,362
We have no choice!

131
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:37,821
We must take that risk.

132
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:41,616
You must take that risk, my son,
for the sake of Fire Keep.

133
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,661
For the sake of your sister.

134
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,914
Go, ride swiftly.

135
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:16,980
Welcome to my hearth.

136
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:20,316
I am Roliel and these woods are my home.

137
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:23,693
You've had a trying journey.

138
00:46:24,903 --> 00:46:27,447
Please let me give you some food and drink.

139
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:30,366
First, you shall rest. Then we will talk.

140
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:34,160
Poor, poor darling.

141
00:46:34,577 --> 00:46:37,997
Did Great Otwa frighten you?

142
00:46:38,164 --> 00:46:42,376
You mustn't be afraid.
He's as gentle as a child.

143
00:46:49,048 --> 00:46:51,551
I saw him twist a chain apart
with his bare hands.

144
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:54,637
Yes, he is strong, my sweet.

145
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:59,641
But he means well, my darling.
He brought you to me, did he not?

146
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,897
I'm so tired.

147
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:11,568
Yes, my poor, poor darling.

148
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:14,654
Yes, you're so tired...

149
00:47:16,364 --> 00:47:17,948
and so beautiful.

150
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:19,783
You must...

151
00:47:40,217 --> 00:47:42,010
Tell me your secrets.

152
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:47,307
Nekron?

153
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:56,314
The girl is wanted by Nekron? The bitch!

154
00:47:56,731 --> 00:47:59,275
She brings danger into my house!

155
00:48:05,488 --> 00:48:08,449
Perhaps I can turn this to my advantage.

156
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:11,369
Otwa, my son.

157
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:16,331
Go and bring the subhumans,
Nekron's dogs.

158
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:19,209
Tell them we have the girl that he wants.

159
00:48:21,544 --> 00:48:24,504
Tell them he can have her, for a price.

160
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:55,239
Kill.

161
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:00,744
Get out of here.

162
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:03,413
- No.
- The hell you won't.

163
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,956
Go find the girl.

164
00:49:42,238 --> 00:49:44,239
Enter, my son. It is not barred.

165
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:52,121
What's wrong with you?
Where are the dogs?

166
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:00,586
You would do this...

167
00:50:56,092 --> 00:50:58,386
Why do the living...

168
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:01,596
disturb the sleep of the dead?

169
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,436
I followed a trail. I seek a girl, Teegra.

170
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:10,855
A girl?

171
00:51:11,897 --> 00:51:16,067
Yes. She did this to me.

172
00:51:16,693 --> 00:51:18,569
She and Nekron.

173
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:23,365
Cursed Nekron.

174
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,533
Where can I find her?

175
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,040
- Why should I answer?
- For revenge against Nekron.

176
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:37,919
Nekron?

177
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,591
Akatar. They take her to Akatar.

178
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,843
And from there to the Icy King's realm.

179
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,220
Avenge me.

180
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:54,183
Avenge me!

181
00:51:56,142 --> 00:51:57,560
Akatar.

182
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,537
Teegra!

183
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,971
My Prince, all is arranged.

184
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,973
I've hired a ship. It waits for us at the dock.

185
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:44,267
Nekron waits at Ice Peak.

186
00:52:50,982 --> 00:52:54,859
Get the gangplanks aboard.
Move, you scum!

187
00:52:55,235 --> 00:52:57,904
We must be well on our way before sunrise.

188
00:53:11,707 --> 00:53:13,875
Why have you brought me this?

189
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:18,755
This is your bride, my son.

190
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:23,759
She will be mother to your sons.

191
00:53:23,843 --> 00:53:26,469
How thoughtful, Mother.

192
00:53:27,387 --> 00:53:31,182
I need no bride, and no sons.

193
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:35,603
- But you need heirs.
- I need nothing!

194
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:37,103
Nekron?

195
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,821
Nekron, you're a great power in the world.

196
00:53:48,947 --> 00:53:51,658
You have all that any man ever wants
or needed.

197
00:53:53,451 --> 00:53:54,911
And yet you despair.

198
00:53:56,287 --> 00:53:58,330
For there is one thing you lack.

199
00:54:00,582 --> 00:54:04,043
One gift that only you can bestow
between our people.

200
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:06,796
Peace.

201
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,757
This is the gift that heals the heart
of the giver.

202
00:54:11,966 --> 00:54:15,386
Nekron, I extend my hand in friendship.

203
00:54:16,095 --> 00:54:18,639
I offer peace between our people.

204
00:54:19,307 --> 00:54:21,016
Will you not take my hand?

205
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:27,480
Will you not call me friend?

206
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:08,598
Woman...

207
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:13,144
I spit on peace.

208
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:16,771
I spit on you.

209
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,781
Next time you present me
with one of your little sluts, Mother dear...

210
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,199
I'll squash you like a bug.

211
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:35,496
Get that garbage out of here.

212
00:56:30,918 --> 00:56:32,253
Don't look up.

213
00:56:32,295 --> 00:56:35,755
We are riders of Fire Keep.
We pay no heed to such trash.

214
00:57:52,028 --> 00:57:56,783
We have come, Lord Nekron,
to negotiate between our two peoples.

215
00:57:57,116 --> 00:57:59,911
And the return to Fire Keep
of my sister, Teegra...

216
00:57:59,994 --> 00:58:02,538
whom your warriors basely kidnapped.

217
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:06,207
My father, King Jarol, has empowered me...

218
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,294
to offer a peace between our kingdoms...

219
00:58:10,336 --> 00:58:13,673
in exchange for his continued sovereignty...

220
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:15,757
and my sister's freedom.

221
00:58:16,007 --> 00:58:20,762
It seems to me that my envoys made
a similar offer not long since...

222
00:58:22,305 --> 00:58:25,640
and that it was spurned
by your illustrious sire.

223
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:28,351
You know full well, Nekron,
that offer was made...

224
00:58:28,435 --> 00:58:30,812
before your minions kidnapped my sister.

225
00:58:30,979 --> 00:58:34,357
I fear, Good Prince,
I cannot offer peace to a people...

226
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,234
who have refused to proclaim me
their rightful overlord.

227
00:58:41,237 --> 00:58:43,364
As to your sister...

228
00:58:44,449 --> 00:58:47,159
I must admit that until this moment...

229
00:58:47,243 --> 00:58:51,204
the idea of mating with her
filled me with loathing.

230
00:58:51,454 --> 00:58:53,414
Perhaps I should reconsider.

231
00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:57,877
Your sister, after all,
is not wholly unattractive.

232
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,588
As lesser beasts go.

233
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:21,021
Pig you are.

234
00:59:21,855 --> 00:59:24,065
And like a pig shall you die.

235
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,625
No!

236
01:00:58,062 --> 01:00:59,814
No, I don't think so.

237
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:13,408
You interest me.

238
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:15,076
Guards!

239
01:01:16,327 --> 01:01:17,662
Bring him to me.

240
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:24,501
Release him.

241
01:01:35,885 --> 01:01:39,055
- Why have you come seeking me?
- You killed my people.

242
01:01:39,722 --> 01:01:43,184
We've had to dispose of
so many undesirables of late.

243
01:03:12,176 --> 01:03:16,012
Let him rest. There is still fight in him.

244
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:13,561
Larn.

245
01:04:17,648 --> 01:04:19,108
Teegra, is that you?

246
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,570
- Teegra, are you all right?
- Yes. I'm trying to unlock the door.

247
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,697
Never mind the door,
you've to get out of here.

248
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:28,574
I'm not leaving without you.
Maybe I can get a key somehow.

249
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:30,076
No, Teegra, don't.

250
01:07:18,177 --> 01:07:19,427
Is he certain?

251
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:23,973
- It was my son you saw?
- They called him Prince Taro.

252
01:07:25,016 --> 01:07:26,017
He died.

253
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:31,813
- What about Teegra?
- He's got her, too.

254
01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:33,648
Maybe she's still alive.

255
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:35,066
It's a chance.

256
01:07:35,191 --> 01:07:38,569
Believe what you want,
but that glacier is a fact.

257
01:07:41,364 --> 01:07:44,240
For three days and nights
it's been pushing south.

258
01:07:45,033 --> 01:07:48,411
A thousand souls lost
because of Nekron's rage.

259
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,123
Fire Keep is next. We must attack.

260
01:07:52,706 --> 01:07:54,499
I need the Dragonhawks.

261
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:58,169
- The Dragonhawks are too few.
- Enough to get in with.

262
01:07:58,503 --> 01:08:01,464
One us might get through and destroy him.

263
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,509
But if that glacier passes beyond the river,
I will have no choice.

264
01:08:07,385 --> 01:08:09,429
I will have to release the lava.

265
01:12:30,443 --> 01:12:32,152
Teegra.

266
01:13:01,886 --> 01:13:02,887
Larn.

267
01:13:11,769 --> 01:13:13,980
Nekron!

268
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:58,226
Die! Die! Why don't you die?

269
01:17:14,392 --> 01:17:18,688
No, Larn! No, it's over, don't you see?
We have to start over.
