1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,272
What is it?

2
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:07,075
It's Bobae's interview
I just wrote it...

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,183
If you could do the article
like the last time...

4
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:10,285
For free?

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,387
Huh?

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,697
Can you lend me some money?

7
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:25,994
Don't have it
Get a pay advance

8
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,001
Yun Hwa

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,007
Is Bobae's article ready?

10
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,474
- No, not yet
- What's going on?

11
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,275
You're here to work not enjoy lunch

12
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,786
Kyong-hee, what about your interview
with Director Hwang?

13
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,184
I'm working on it
and I didn't even eat lunch

14
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:50,883
Then you had more time
to finish it!

15
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:52,985
The Interview was just yesterday

16
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,392
Stop talking back!

17
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,895
What are you all just
standing around for?

18
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:04,096
Get to work!
Work!

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,298
Think about your families
You're the one's they depend on!

20
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:10,175
Who's gonna feed
and clothe them?

21
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:18,386
What are you doing?

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,885
Huh?

23
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:23,685
Just had lunch and coffee...

24
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:25,087
Have lunch?

25
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:32,592
Were you with Kyong-hee
last night?

26
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:37,202
Nothing happened

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,107
We just had dinner, really

28
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:42,904
nothing more

29
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:47,277
Don't try anything to her
you'll regret it

30
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,181
She's not my type

31
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,980
What's wrong with her?

32
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:56,284
She's better than any other...

33
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:01,687
Stop clowning and get to work!

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,797
Yes.

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,998
It's pretty good

36
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,174
I'm busy, today

37
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:28,685
Can I pick the menu?

38
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,908
You must like fish

39
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,275
I love it

40
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:52,277
Why aren't you eating
Miss Song?

41
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:56,282
Call me Yun Hwa

42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,383
We're the same age

43
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,685
Why the sudden change of mind?

44
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:09,695
Waiter, we ordered eel sushi!

45
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,301
We already had it

46
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,905
Why aren't you eating?

47
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,775
I don't like raw fish

48
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,278
Huh?

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,882
Why didn't you say so?

50
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:31,986
You wanted to pick the menu

51
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,290
Oh, geez...

52
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,486
Now I feel bad

53
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,896
It's okay
I can eat this

54
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,782
I wanted to pay...

55
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:10,687
But you didn't eat anything

56
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,986
Still I should have paid...

57
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,790
I was planning to pay anyways...

58
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,695
I'd rather starve than to
have a girl pay for my meal

59
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,597
And I can afford it

60
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,971
Good-bye

61
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:34,081
Huh?

62
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:37,778
You have work to do

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,888
We didn't even talk

64
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:43,286
How about some coffee?

65
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:46,189
Do we need to talk?

66
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,593
No, but, hah, hah...

67
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,095
you're right,

68
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,896
the article is going to
take some time

69
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,697
I should really be getting on it

70
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,304
Hey, it's me

71
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:06,778
You're car stopped again

72
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,383
No, no it's not empty

73
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,482
I'm here at the...

74
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:17,590
Hello? Hello?

75
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,991
Another busy day at the office

76
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,396
You all have a deadline to meet

77
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,799
Be alert, alert!

78
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:32,998
Do a good job

79
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,507
we're here to make money...

80
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,478
Okay, work, work, work!

81
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,201
Great! Good work, everyone!

82
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:03,804
It's selling like hot cakes!

83
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:06,406
- Wonderful
- Are you treating us?

84
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:10,377
Treat yourself!

85
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,173
Such a scrooge!

86
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:15,173
You two!

87
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,879
Their storming to be interviewed

88
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,182
Kyong-hee!

89
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:27,295
Did you write the interview
or copy it from a book?

90
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,193
It's exactly what he said

91
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,994
Who's going to understand that?

92
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:37,195
You should have used easy words

93
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,500
We're no rocket scientists

94
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,404
Why're you picking on me?

95
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:45,479
Do it right, then!

96
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:08,502
Yun Hwa!

97
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,809
You're grateful, huh?

98
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:21,181
Thanks to me, you just earned
everyone's respect

99
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,681
Thank you

100
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,987
It was nothing

101
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:28,989
But...

102
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,987
I still think you should
take off the glasses

103
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,788
That's odd

104
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:39,297
Don't you want to look pretty?

105
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:47,401
Oh, that temper!

106
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:53,677
- You really are something!
- What?

107
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,783
You embarrassed me
in front of everyone!

108
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,477
Is that how you treat
all your lovers?

109
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,282
No, you're the strange one

110
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:02,981
Get this straight

111
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:06,389
I'm still your boss

112
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,894
And you want me to
overlook your mistakes

113
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,191
because we're lovers?
Do you?

114
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,698
It's a cold world we live in

115
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:16,497
Unless you're smart
They'll spit you out

116
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:19,198
This is no game

117
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,900
That's corny!

118
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,067
This is corny?

119
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,480
Yeah, this is really corny

120
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,386
Corny...

121
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:41,395
Yes

122
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:44,591
2 o'clock?

123
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,895
Okay, thanks for your time

124
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,799
I'll see you there

125
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,268
It's none of your business
whether I wear my glasses!

126
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,575
You guys lovers or something?

127
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:02,080
Gee whiz!
Take it outside!

128
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,391
Is that so hard?

129
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:12,993
Kyung-Hyun!

130
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:14,389
Kyung-Hyun!

131
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,795
- Today, I...
- I'm busy

132
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,297
Are you avoiding me?

133
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,994
I'm not
I really am busy

134
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:25,503
I need to drink, or I'll flip!

135
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,302
No, I'm really busy

136
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,172
You said I was a study case

137
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:33,769
I'll show you everything, tonight

138
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:35,678
What are you talking about?

139
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:38,183
I never said I wanted to study you

140
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,378
- What?
- I'll see you tomorrow

141
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,784
Hey!

142
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:44,692
Oh, shit!

143
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:52,995
Bang, Bang

144
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:56,301
Answer it!

145
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,605
Answer the phone!

146
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:04,871
Honey, please get it

147
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,181
Hello?

148
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,788
H, Hello?

149
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,191
Oh, who?

150
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:40,271
Geez...

151
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:45,677
Do you have to do that
in front of the door?

152
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,684
Sure

153
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:47,879
Doesn't it bother you?

154
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,489
She may have eaten something weird

155
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:52,388
And have bad breath
or something

156
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,585
Nope

157
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:55,093
Is she vaccinated?

158
00:10:57,832 --> 00:11:00,801
- Oh, that's sick
- What do you know?

159
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:04,496
You never kissed before, jerk!

160
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,200
I choose not to
It's like smoking, a bad habit

161
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:10,971
You didn't have a chance...

162
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,773
I'm bushed!

163
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:16,281
Hey, are you busy?

164
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,783
This is hot!

165
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,478
Kiss of Fire!

166
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,185
Enjoy it!

167
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:08,497
Give me one stronger!

168
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:11,605
Miss, try to savor the drink

169
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:15,402
and slowly feel the love rising

170
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:17,477
I don't know anything
about cocktails

171
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,479
But I do know a little bit
about love

172
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,175
I've been in love more

173
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,581
than the number of cocktails
you made

174
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,085
do you know anything
about love?

175
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:30,986
Hey, Jeanie

176
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,583
mix up a
'sex on the beach' for her!

177
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:45,706
Kyong-hee

178
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:49,505
- You're here
- It's late

179
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,171
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
called you, but...

180
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,282
No, I'm glad you did

181
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,678
Same for me

182
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,179
Kyong-hee...

183
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,882
Hey, you're beautiful tonight

184
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,386
You know...

185
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:10,190
I've waited for your call...

186
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,789
It's true...

187
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,003
Stupid!

188
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:19,504
- You shouldn't have said that
- What?

189
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:21,903
Stupid!

190
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,470
Hey, Kyong-hee!

191
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,291
Geez, what is this saying?

192
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,699
You're no friend

193
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,400
I mean I'm no computer whiz!

194
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:04,180
Now, what? What do you want?

195
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:06,386
Hey!

196
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:10,686
- Can you erase the glasses?
- Why?

197
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:13,089
For what?

198
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,991
- Just do it
- You like her?

199
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,598
- What?
- Do you like her?

200
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,600
Forget I asked!

201
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,295
You do

202
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:26,406
What are you talking about

203
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,009
She's not my type

204
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:32,271
And I told you, until I make it
in this field, I'm not falling for a girl

205
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:37,077
Love has nothing to do with business

206
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,082
Oh, all right

207
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:42,189
Do what again?

208
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:43,483
Forget it!

209
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:12,183
Good morning, sir

210
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:26,493
What's wrong, did someone die?

211
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,896
Let's go

212
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:30,099
Where?

213
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:32,001
Min Joo's interview

214
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,009
Can Mr. Yang go with...

215
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,671
Oh, okay

216
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:42,080
Choose one

217
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:42,875
What?

218
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:46,578
Either me or your wife

219
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,382
- No, Kyong-hee...
- You know

220
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:50,387
I can't do this anymore

221
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:53,084
Can't we just go on this way?

222
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,795
For who's sake?

223
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:58,792
- Kyong-hee, please...
- Hurry up and decide

224
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,901
It's up to you

225
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:03,799
Whatever you decide
let me know by today

226
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:07,407
Before I go home

227
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,669
Your monthly allowance?

228
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,076
Same as anyone my age

229
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,375
How much do you drink?

230
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,780
Same as anyone my age

231
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,884
But, your questions
aren't very different from others

232
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,285
Huh?

233
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:26,882
Your articles seemed unique
That's why! liked it

234
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:31,198
That's her style

235
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:32,993
It sounds like regular

236
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:34,999
but she's reading the person

237
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:37,696
And then she puts that on paper

238
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,701
Well, then I'll get serious

239
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,077
What kind of love
are you looking for?

240
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
Wow, that's heavy

241
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:51,478
Hmm...

242
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,179
- The kind of love...
- Min Joo, ready?

243
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:57,189
- They're ready to start
- I think they're starting

244
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:58,792
Aren't you going to interview me?

245
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:01,486
Today is Min Joo's day

246
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,096
Then, see you next time

247
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,289
I'll be back soon
You'll be here, right?

248
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,275
What were you thinking?

249
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,184
- Get more extras, stupid!
- Yes, sir

250
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,285
Looks like a sad ending

251
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,486
It's rain

252
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,688
Rain comes with sad endings
Too obvious

253
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:40,699
Excuse me, who are you?

254
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:43,303
Entertainment World
interviewing Min Joo

255
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,200
Oh, good

256
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:48,706
Can you help us out?

257
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:52,973
Don't move, just listen to me

258
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,982
You will all be walking
when it starts to shower

259
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,279
All of you open your umbrellas

260
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,285
and move on

261
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:03,287
Those that don't have one

262
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:05,790
Run quickly

263
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,791
- Okay?
- yes

264
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:09,793
Don't look at the camera

265
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,488
- Okay
- Let's try it

266
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,798
We're ready, sir

267
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,505
- Okay, let's shoot!
- Alright

268
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:23,567
Don't be nervous

269
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,077
Walk naturally

270
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:27,874
Who's nervous?!

271
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,494
- What are you doing?
- It's broken

272
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:51,002
- It's not opening
- Oh, great

273
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:52,503
Let's run!

274
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:01,274
Oh gee

275
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:02,973
Here, use this

276
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,604
One more time

277
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:41,681
You're lucky
you look good in pictures

278
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,188
You're really lucky

279
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,398
Your attention, please

280
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,977
Um...

281
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:10,880
Due to personal reasons

282
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,178
Kyong-hee

283
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,688
who's been with us for over
three years has decided to leave us

284
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:24,391
We should wish her all the best

285
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:27,399
and hope to meet again

286
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,298
Let's not be too sad

287
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:32,501
Kyong-hee, we'll miss you

288
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,505
A farewell party?

289
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,576
Geez, what party!

290
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,873
I'll get you a job at a steak house!

291
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:45,783
Damn it!

292
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,286
Well, let's go out
It's on me!

293
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:52,381
Cheap S.O.B.!

294
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:54,289
Hey, Kyong-hee!

295
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,305
It wasn't a sad ending

296
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,273
You're right

297
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:18,778
Hey

298
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:20,682
You two!

299
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,187
She's your study case?

300
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,985
Her?

301
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:29,391
Everyone's made me
out for a fool

302
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,498
Good luck

303
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:41,203
Ajerk and a fool!

304
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,003
A good combination

305
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:49,082
So drunk so early

306
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,774
- Are you alright?
- Hey, you...

307
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,579
- What?
- You better be good to me

308
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,778
Don't say that

309
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:56,685
- I'm always good to you
- Just don't argue

310
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,985
No, honey
Not, there!

311
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:03,495
Be nice, okay?
I'm you're savior!

312
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:06,498
What's wrong with you today?

313
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:08,295
Why?

314
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:10,903
I've gone mad, trying to make

315
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,098
the biggest decision of my life

316
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:51,167
Hello?

317
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:54,770
Auntie?
Are you sleeping?

318
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,678
Sorry

319
00:22:56,817 --> 00:23:02,380
No, I just couldn't sleep
No, nothing's wrong

320
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:08,293
Auntie, you know that thing...

321
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,195
You know what I'm talking about

322
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:16,501
I wanted to know are you sure

323
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:20,095
all I so is close my eyes
and that's it?

324
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,471
There's more, isn't there?

325
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,475
Come on...

326
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,672
Such as...

327
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:33,277
You get all hot

328
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:36,989
Or your head feels like
it's on fire...

329
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:42,289
No, someone said...

330
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,192
Okay, good night

331
00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:54,299
You're right, she looks better
without the glasses

332
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:55,999
Take a look

333
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,772
She actually looks good enough for you

334
00:23:59,913 --> 00:24:01,676
Come and take a look

335
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,975
Come on

336
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:05,278
I saw it

337
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:05,976
You saw it?

338
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,088
Yes, right up close!

339
00:24:08,222 --> 00:24:10,486
All this, for nothing

340
00:24:12,726 --> 00:24:15,092
I could undress her!

341
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:17,789
You want me to?
I will

342
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:19,296
You, son-of-a-bitch!

343
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,567
You ungrateful, son-of-a-bitch

344
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,678
I'm sorry

345
00:25:05,813 --> 00:25:07,781
You're saying
you're not in love?

346
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,185
How far did you go?

347
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,287
I'm gonna punch you

348
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:18,482
Don't deny it

349
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,788
Do as you will

350
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,988
I don't have time for you

351
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:26,797
Why do they say that

352
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,902
breaking up hurts less

353
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:32,802
after the first one?

354
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,999
Don't look at me like that

355
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:36,302
Unlike you

356
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,072
I can have relationships

357
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:41,477
and not be scared of getting hurt

358
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:47,082
They called today

359
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:49,086
So, you got your wish

360
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:24,791
- Hey
- Yang!

361
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,187
What?

362
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,477
- You're early, today?
- Yes

363
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,584
Where'd it go?

364
00:26:59,526 --> 00:27:04,793
I... I took off my glasses

365
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:07,492
but I feel weird

366
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:11,001
Where's my change?

367
00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:12,196
Here it is

368
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,998
I bore you, don't I?

369
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:45,900
The coffee is too sweet

370
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,168
I envy Kyong-hee

371
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:58,182
She's straightforward
friendly, and outgoing...

372
00:27:58,318 --> 00:28:00,377
And so little...

373
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:07,086
Why am I like this, I ask myself

374
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,991
I get upset with myself

375
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:19,198
But I'm a good runner

376
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,204
By myself...

377
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,573
Why are you telling me this?

378
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:26,079
what?

379
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,178
Talking about yourself
Right now!

380
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:34,481
- I just wanted to...
- Let's go back

381
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:45,892
Yes, good job

382
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:47,500
Yun Hwa!

383
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:49,898
Your cover, from now on...

384
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:51,299
I'm sorry...

385
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,506
Who are you?

386
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:57,667
Is this Yun Hwa?

387
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:04,275
You had face surgery?

388
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:07,878
Yun Hwa! Yun Hwa!

389
00:29:09,823 --> 00:29:11,188
What's wrong with her?

390
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,292
How should I know?!

391
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:27,700
I already pushed it

392
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:52,580
Yun Hwa!

393
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,589
Gosh, thatjoke cost me

394
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:59,191
three days your absence?

395
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:03,996
From now on
your articles will be titled

396
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,099
'Yun Hwa's Photo Essays'

397
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:09,702
- What?
- The boss thinks

398
00:32:09,836 --> 00:32:12,498
it'll do the Magazine a lot of better

399
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,903
With your article

400
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,168
Photos of Min Joo Kim

401
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,574
Kyung-Hyun quit

402
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:22,079
He got a better offer

403
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:25,184
Aren't you getting any offers?

404
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:33,692
Can I ask a favor?

405
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:36,993
What?

406
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:39,193
That...

407
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,391
You're uncle's magazine office...

408
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:44,594
To reporter, Yun Hwa...

409
00:32:44,738 --> 00:32:46,296
Can you give it to her?

410
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,872
Hey, Joon-Sup...

411
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:51,773
Hey!

412
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:55,280
You give it to her in person

413
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:56,677
or throw it away!

414
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:04,784
Entertainment World
Hold on

415
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:08,986
Air Cleaning?
Wow!

416
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,697
I'm buying dinner
my treat

417
00:33:17,837 --> 00:33:20,203
Celebrating the Kiss!

418
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,307
Hello?

419
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,277
Hold on

420
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:33,279
Yun Hwa you're bad
work habit's back

421
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:42,995
Hello? Speaking

422
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,396
Hello?

423
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:58,277
Long time, huh?

424
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:02,374
Really?

425
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:07,081
How have you been?

426
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,687
So, so

427
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,904
I was foolish

428
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,372
I knew it was a mistake
when I left

429
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:36,077
I thought about us, a lot...

430
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:42,081
I was crazy to...

431
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:45,988
you're such a sweet...

432
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:54,890
- Can we...?
- I'm sorry

433
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:57,094
I can't hear your words

434
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,273
What are you doing here?

435
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:14,581
I went by the office and
they told me you were here

436
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,188
What do you want?

437
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,086
I just...
You know...

438
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:21,693
I wanted to ask you...

439
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,887
It's not that important...

440
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,395
What is it?

441
00:35:25,532 --> 00:35:31,095
The 'he' in your diary...

442
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:32,204
is it me?

443
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,907
You read my diary?!

444
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,566
No, by accident

445
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,371
Tell me, is it me?

446
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:42,877
No, it's not you

447
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:46,779
It isn't, I knew it...

448
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:52,381
I wasn't sure
it just sounded like me

449
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,493
For a second I thought
you know...

450
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:56,094
I was over myself, huh?

451
00:35:58,431 --> 00:35:59,398
Well, I gotta go

452
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,591
I have to meet my boss, so...

453
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:02,792
I'll be going now

454
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:12,770
Wearing your glasses, again?
You look better without 'em!

455
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:14,777
Good-bye

456
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:34,892
She's coming!

457
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:37,195
- Hold it straight, straight!
- Hold it right!

458
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:20,169
Kyung-Hyun said if we didn't do this
he'd blow the building up

459
00:37:20,313 --> 00:37:21,678
Kids nowadays mean it

460
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,475
They do, for sure

461
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:37,292
I'm sorry
Without your permission

462
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,398
We'll wrap it up

463
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:10,186
Leave it
I'll do it, later

464
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,298
Have a good weekend, all!

465
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:14,900
- I'll be going
- Alright

466
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:19,798
It's raining, dreadfully...

467
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:23,466
I feel like a drink

468
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,771
Let's go

469
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:30,781
I used to get so sentimental

470
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,886
but now I get upset if my wife
forgets my umbrella...

471
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:36,789
I miss my single life

472
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,686
Mr. Yang!

473
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,793
I forgot to tell, you
Your wife called

474
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,691
and she said she was on her way
with the umbrella. Sorry

475
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,890
- Bye
- Thanks

476
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,799
Well, I'll ask someone else

477
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:06,076
Don't stay out there
wait in here

478
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,279
Hurry up!
The smell is making me sick

479
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:11,583
Okay, be right out!

480
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:17,189
Do we have to go, here?

481
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,891
They sell my skin lotion

482
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:23,298
Gosh why are you so particular?

483
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:25,097
I'm hungry

484
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,369
You're well?

485
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:35,872
Honey!

486
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:40,183
Hungry? Let's go to dinner

487
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,184
You want to go out?

488
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:42,379
I want ribs

489
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:45,491
- No, something better
- I'm so lucky

490
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:46,990
Taxi!

491
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:52,097
Honey, come on!

492
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:53,493
Oh, all right

493
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,803
Smells good?

494
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:09,679
You're really in this movie?

495
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:11,579
That's right

496
00:40:11,718 --> 00:40:13,982
I come on during the climax
of the movie

497
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,281
I spent the whole day

498
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:17,582
with Min Joo Kim

499
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:19,385
- it wasn't even funny
- The boss doesn't like his staff

500
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:21,686
to be too loose like that

501
00:40:21,828 --> 00:40:23,295
Bad image for the company

502
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,296
Forget about the past

503
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,501
Drinks...
I'll get some drinks

504
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:44,083
I know it's here...

505
00:40:44,217 --> 00:40:48,176
Where is it?

506
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:50,386
Here it is!

507
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,772
It's been awhile

508
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:27,385
It's starting

509
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,995
Hurry up, Come on

510
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:32,597
The movie's about to start

511
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:34,700
Uh...

512
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:42,306
The movie's...
starting...

513
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:28,883
What are they doing?

514
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:30,579
I didn‘t know this was a musical!

515
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:33,692
Hey, when are we going to
see you?

516
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:54,173
There he is
Isn't it?

517
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,674
You're only an extra!

518
00:42:57,817 --> 00:43:00,479
Oh, this movie is pretty bad

519
00:43:46,933 --> 00:43:48,491
Where did he go?

520
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:53,503
- He has the car
- Probably got embarrassed

521
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:56,107
How can he show us
this bad movie?

522
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:58,667
The umbrella is broken

523
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,185
Joon-Sup?

524
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:19,985
It's me

525
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:21,991
Did they all come?

526
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:26,391
Bunch of losers

527
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:30,597
You know what...

528
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:32,601
I saw her today

529
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:34,706
at the theater

530
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,469
Isn't it weird

531
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,579
Here?

532
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:43,682
Phone booth

533
00:45:43,816 --> 00:45:46,080
We did our scene here

534
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:48,277
No, I'm alone
Why?

535
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:51,185
I just thought that...

536
00:45:51,323 --> 00:45:55,885
If I came here
she would be here, too

537
00:45:56,028 --> 00:45:58,690
What?
Yeah

538
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:02,790
I ran away again

539
00:46:02,935 --> 00:46:03,902
Hey!

540
00:46:05,037 --> 00:46:09,770
I see her in two months
and all I say is

541
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,276
'it's been awhile
the movie's starting'

542
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:16,176
That was all I said

543
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:20,376
Funny, huh?

544
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,487
I'm stupid

545
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:30,186
She's not coming

546
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,798
She's not...

547
00:46:39,538 --> 00:46:42,701
You know...

548
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,366
I think it's over

549
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:48,475
I can't see her again

550
00:46:52,418 --> 00:46:55,182
I can't even cry at this moment...

551
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:58,188
Huh?
Yeah...

552
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,394
Now I can't...

553
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,590
Can I come in?

554
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:00,683
Yun Hwa!
I was just...

555
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,082
Do you...

556
00:48:03,322 --> 00:48:04,880
Do you want to kiss?
