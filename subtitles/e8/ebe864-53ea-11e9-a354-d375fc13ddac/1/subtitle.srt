8
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,734
My first love?

9
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,531
Everyone wants a dramatic
love story of their own

10
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,038
Like a woman wanting the child
of the married man

11
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,439
she's having an affair with

12
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:55,036
or the loyal woman waiting for the man
who's been convicted for life

13
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,912
I wanted a more serious relationship

14
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,919
I want a touching love
where I stay by my love

15
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,319
who suffers from a fatal disease

16
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,620
and I would cry until
my eyes pop out

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,320
My first love was too healthy

18
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,627
Director/ Tae Kyoon Kim
Turned out to be
a bummer I mean

19
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,735
It got to a point
his good appetite

20
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,634
and his healthy work-outs

21
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,831
made me sick to my stomach

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,239
I couldn't ask him
to drop dead

23
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,743
and so we broke up

24
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,910
Hey, won't the readers
think I am stupid?

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,211
What's wrong?

26
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,622
Low battery

27
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,718
Please go on

28
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,527
So we broke up

29
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,133
It was a special relation

30
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,231
Miss Song

31
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,037
What's wrong?
You're not yourself

32
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,840
What?
What happened?

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,915
- What?
- Your first love

34
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,517
Did he die?

35
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,517
I told you
We broke up

36
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,519
Ah, right, right

37
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,015
Myjaw hurts...
the whole day...

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,320
God, I'm stressed

39
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,426
I hate these kissing scenes

40
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,432
- Kissing is that hard?
- You've never kissed before?

41
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,332
No!

42
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,132
Look at the time!

43
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,332
Everyone get ready

44
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,840
That's my cue...

45
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,621
Were ready to roll
Stand by

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,022
Ready!

47
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,528
Okay, Let's shoot!

48
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,323
Retake scene 36
cut 14

49
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,629
Action!

50
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,519
Cut!

51
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,718
What the hell!

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,827
Uh, oh!

53
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:04,330
FIRST KISS

54
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,730
I'm sorry I'm late...

55
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,733
About yesterday...
I'm really sorry...

56
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,537
I just didn't know...
Actually...

57
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,619
- Where, did I put the tickets?
- Yun Hwa!

58
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,122
Ithink...

59
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,331
Let's break up

60
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,130
lam tired of this

61
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,533
I can't take this, any more

62
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,831
Let's just break up!

63
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,231
Entertainment World...

64
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,327
Yes? Uh, huh...
hold, please, I'll put her on

65
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,841
It's for you
Cherry Hong's manager

66
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,533
He says he wont
do the interview

67
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,914
Hello? This is Yun Hwa

68
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,315
Mr. Kim... huh?

69
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,417
Why?

70
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:42,025
the deadline is this weekend
and I need the interview this week

71
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,831
If you donâ€˜t want to do it forget it
Why are you screaming?

72
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,230
Okay forget it!

73
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,928
Who gives a darn
if that star of yours

74
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,733
wears gold lace panties
to bed, big deal!

75
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,933
Stupid, jerks!
Forget it!

76
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,824
Yun Hwa

77
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,530
What did you say to Mr. Kim?

78
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,934
he's really ticked

79
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,531
He said Cherry Hong has
no time, so I said forget it

80
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,643
Forget it?!

81
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,645
You said what?
Who's going to fill the cover?

82
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,608
If you don't want your nudes
on the cover, get the interview

83
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,617
Got it?!

84
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,913
Geez!

85
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,234
Well, he's the boss!

86
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,633
Knock, first
Want them to know about us?

87
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,641
Chicken!

88
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,912
Why did you sleep with me
in the first place?

89
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,215
What's wrong now?

90
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,323
Fire that Yun Hwa!

91
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,516
I can't stand it any longer

92
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,321
I told you

93
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,622
don't let her bother you

94
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,927
I can't, she's driving me crazy!

95
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,833
She's better now since
she hooked herself with a man

96
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,438
Don't make me laugh!

97
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,238
And what's this?

98
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,241
Oh, that...

99
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:43,815
It's just...
It's good for my image, 'family-man'

100
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,010
Okay, Okay...

101
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,417
Is that better?

102
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,725
What's wrong?

103
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,426
You love the 'Melodrama' section

104
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,335
Do you have something
that'll make me sleep?

105
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,236
Would you do business like that?

106
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,610
My panties, it's flying away

107
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,413
My husband's finally talking

108
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,435
Answer the phone!

109
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,141
Uh... hello?

110
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,009
Hello, this is the research facility

111
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,211
Oh, you stupid...
Oh geez...

112
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:59,518
But you're not stupid enough
to starve yourself!

113
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,221
Look at these stacked dishes...
My sister had to have you

114
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,224
Come here... Look

115
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,825
What is so hard?
That's not hard, huh?

116
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:16,135
You don't have to do anything
just close your eyes

117
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,640
Here, let me show you

118
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,543
Please, leave me alone

119
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,018
Why do you hate her so much?

120
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,824
She drives me nuts!

121
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,228
I'll move her desk... alright?

122
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,426
I want her gone, permanently!

123
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,630
Oh, you're bad, Be nice!
She's not so bad

124
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,037
You want to sleep with her, too?

125
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,044
How did I get mixed up with you

126
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,514
Really!
Why do I waste my time with you?

127
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,713
You know why
I'm you're ticket to success!

128
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:50,134
That's disgusting!
So what, you're a newlywed?

129
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,129
Jealous?
Get yourself a new wife!

130
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:58,335
Just you wait
it'll be over in 3 months

131
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,443
Kyong-hee

132
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,016
You girls like to bite
when you kiss?

133
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,813
Your bride must've been hungry

134
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,629
Hey, Yun Hwa

135
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:25,930
Come in here!

136
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,945
You have your own
work hours, now?

137
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,016
You've been late 27 times
this month alone!

138
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,413
Wake up!

139
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,422
I ought to fire you!

140
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,219
Say hello to each other

141
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,725
This is our newcomer

142
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,525
And that's our senior reporter

143
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,531
and a bad role model

144
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,636
Hello, I'm Kyung-Hyun Han

145
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,237
at your service

146
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,741
I'm sorry, your name is...

147
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,242
Save that for later

148
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,905
How's Cherry Hong's
interview going?

149
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,812
Did you phone Mr. Kim?

150
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,918
No

151
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:18,012
I warned you
Your first assignment...

152
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,625
Take her nudes

153
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,726
What?

154
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,420
Get out

155
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,226
Either her nudes or
Cherry's pictures and interview

156
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,130
Get going!

157
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,618
Hello!

158
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,423
I'm Kyung-Hyun Han and I'm new

159
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,432
lam very happy to be here

160
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,433
I'd like to introduce myself...

161
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,128
- Hey!
- Yes?

162
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,036
Yun Hwa!
Get to Apkujung now!

163
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,144
Mr. Kim said he'll do the interview
with Cherry during her lunch

164
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,338
30 minutes only!

165
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,416
Send someone else

166
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,919
Don't push it!

167
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,117
What happened
to our angel Yun Hwa?

168
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,024
Someone please tell me

169
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,131
Me, me!

170
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,840
- Don't just stand there
- Yes

171
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,710
- Move it
- Oh, yes

172
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,111
Yun Hwa?

173
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,412
It's really a pleasure
working with you

174
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,012
Is something wrong?

175
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,426
Don't call me by my name

176
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,425
I just thought...
you looked my age

177
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,927
I thought we...

178
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,930
Miss Song!
Where are you going?

179
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,129
- To the subway...
- Umm... I have a car...

180
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,435
- What car?
- My car

181
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,236
So?

182
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,937
Huh? No, it's just...

183
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,411
You like to read?

184
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,328
The ending is pretty bad

185
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,430
They both die
without meeting each other

186
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,533
Pretty sad, and it still sells

187
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,308
Miss Song, you don't wear
any makeup?

188
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,027
Cherry, be nice

189
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,426
Otherwise, she's
not going to mention

190
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,225
your gold lace panty...

191
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,338
- Why did you become an actress?
- 'Cuz it's fun

192
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,343
You'll have time later for pictures

193
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,946
Don't let me bother you

194
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,515
I don't like to take posed shots

195
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,514
Over here

196
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,516
This is so natural

197
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,120
Please continue your interview

198
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,223
Go on

199
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,528
- What kind of actress do you want to be?
- A popular one

200
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,635
Cherry, You have a shoot at 2:00

201
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,031
So hurry up with the interview

202
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,832
When do I get to eat?

203
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,931
- Grab a burger on the way!
- But I, want noodles, too

204
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,240
Who's your favorite male actor?

205
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,906
Don't care for any...

206
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,814
Order noodles for me

207
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,217
and have them deliver right away
or I'm not moving

208
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,917
You want trouble
with that producer, again?

209
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,722
Come on hurry up

210
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,135
Can I use your phone?

211
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,643
Noodle House?

212
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,010
Give me your
biggest bowl of noodles!

213
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,808
You want dumplings
on the side?

214
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,017
Why'd you do that?

215
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,716
Don't let these clowns bother you

216
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,121
And what makes you the expert?

217
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,019
Well, I just thought...

218
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,032
Miss Song!

219
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,838
Miss Song!

220
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,536
The subway is this way

221
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,125
Miss Song, it's me
Kyung-Hyun

222
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,526
Where are you?

223
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,328
Are you working
on the interview article?

224
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,334
Please call me, I'll be waiting

225
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,613
She won't call back today

226
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,416
Thank you

227
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,214
I'm, Kyong-hee Park

228
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,017
I think we can be good friends, later

229
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,527
What's wrong with now?

230
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,323
Uh, alright

231
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,734
I like your style!

232
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,131
Not so bad yourself

233
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,833
Your outfit and stocking's are nice

234
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,434
Good color coordination
I bet you're photogenic

235
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,547
Really?

236
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,615
But the make-up...

237
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,411
Try red wine lipstick

238
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,713
Red wine?
Really?

239
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,423
Can I ask you something?

240
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,923
- Anything
- About Miss Song...

241
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,822
What about her?

242
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,124
Is she always like that

243
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,426
or is she just in a bad mood?

244
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,829
She's always like that

245
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,837
A sorry case
she's hysterical all the time...

246
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:45,342
it's gotten worse

247
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,243
ever since she broke up with her boyfriend

248
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,110
She's a downer...

249
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,413
You know what she did while
she had a boyfriend?

250
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:58,614
She must have written
volumes in her diary

251
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,122
That's primitive

252
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,023
She's that old-fashioned?

253
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,924
- You're telling me
- Bet that relationship...

254
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,928
- didn't last
- Right

255
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,430
Obviously

256
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,335
Really, red wine?

257
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,530
What?

258
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,632
My lips, you said red wine

259
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,438
From a professional view

260
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,414
Try to tone down
Go with more earthy tones

261
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,916
that icy look is out

262
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:28,917
Really?

263
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,819
A good study case

264
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,016
Really?

265
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,027
Huh?

266
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,336
Miss!

267
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,238
Miss!

268
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,045
Miss!

269
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,447
Wake up
Go home and sleep

270
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:05,923
Ouch, ouch

271
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,118
Easy, easy

272
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,023
Okay, here

273
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,427
What are you doing?

274
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:18,525
We're looking at his sore tongue

275
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,540
I spent the night making out
with my wife

276
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,132
Show-off!

277
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,145
- Ouch
- Oh, biting kisses

278
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,112
What do you mean?

279
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,820
Where the woman
bites your tongue

280
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:40,118
She bit you all night
and you don't know why?

281
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:44,024
That boring thing, all night?

282
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,824
Want to know something
much better?

283
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:47,829
What's that?

284
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,228
Is it hot?

285
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,934
Air Cleaning Kiss

286
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,835
You breathe into
each other's mouth

287
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,535
Breath in and out!

288
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,415
Then the air becomes warm and
your body is hot for each other

289
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,415
Whoa!

290
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,511
Try that in the back of the bus

291
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,615
You'll think you are flying!

292
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,620
You're a pro

293
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,425
Women won't leave me alone

294
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,831
It's Kyung-Hyun...
where are you

295
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,530
What are you going to do
with the interview?

296
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,438
Second message...
Miss Song, it's Kyung-Hyun...

297
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,239
Third message...
Miss Song, it's Kyung-Hyun...

298
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,111
Forth message...
Miss Song, it's Kyung-Hyun...

299
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,015
Fifth message...
Miss Song...

300
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,122
You have no more messages

301
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,030
He's cute
How old is he?

302
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,537
Three years old

303
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,244
This is crap, do it over!

304
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,512
Dinner, anyone?

305
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,121
Deadline's tomorrow
who's got time for dinner?

306
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,917
Treat us next time...

307
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,719
What you'll do for a lousy salary

308
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,521
How about a welcoming party
for the rookie?

309
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,424
Whatever...

310
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,030
Hey, where's Yun Hwa?

311
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,633
I paged her countless times
but she won't answer

312
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,234
Where the hell is she?

313
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,631
I don't know

314
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,737
Kyung-Hyun...

315
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,631
Anyways, be nice to her

316
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,038
Huh? Why me?

317
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,045
Just do it
Don't ask questions!

318
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,715
How're the pictures?

319
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,515
Work of art!

320
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,315
Did you strip her?

321
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,821
Huh?

322
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,118
Get the pictures
and the article on my desk

323
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,420
Got it?

324
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,528
What?

325
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,527
I can't get in touch with her...

326
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,236
smack, smack, Kiss!

327
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,345
- You must like children?
- Kiss, Kiss

328
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,711
He's so adorable
Kiss, smack

329
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,408
Smack, smack, Kiss!

330
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,337
Get ready

331
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,109
Good, that's it...

332
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,221
You're back

333
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,027
Who's that?
He's cute!

334
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,222
Forget it!
He's gay

335
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,027
That's 'cuz he's never been
with a woman like me!

336
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,038
How's the new work?
How's my uncle treating you?

337
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,041
The office sucks
and your uncle is a bully

338
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:55,943
This is the thanks I get

339
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,914
Couldn't you find better work for me?

340
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,416
I mean I took thisjob
because you asked

341
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,817
but if the other company calls
I'm gonna take it without question

342
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,822
I'm an artist!

343
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,928
Let's try a different pose

344
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,428
Give me a powerful look

345
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,828
Hey, are you busy?

346
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,129
Now, what?

347
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,810
All we had was time

348
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:35,010
But, we didn't spend that time loving

349
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:39,817
Just like a one-eyed fish
that's how I want to live

350
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,323
If I'm alone

351
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,026
all alone...

352
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:51,731
I hope to be saved quickly with the will
to survive like the one-eyed fish

353
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:57,638
to have the will
to love 'til the end...

354
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,038
What do you think?

355
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,940
That's corny

356
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,546
You don't like it?

357
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,814
that get these stupid books
They don't even help!

358
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,619
Not like that

359
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:11,517
Come on, fix it

360
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,715
- Brighter!
- I don't get you

361
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,418
I told you to take
computer lessons

362
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,327
Save your speech for another day
This isn't work for you

363
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,727
Then you do it!

364
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,925
Okay, okay

365
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,127
I'm sorry

366
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,431
Who's she?
Another actress?

367
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,937
No

368
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,439
If she's not an actress
why's her picture here?

369
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,043
I work with her and I happened to have
some extra film so I used it

370
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,646
No, you can't fool me

371
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,409
I sense love and emotion
in these shots

372
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,019
Shut-up! Let's finish it
so I can get some sleep

373
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,518
You're the devil

374
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,316
I feed you
give you my house, a job

375
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,425
I even gave you my car

376
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,017
- And you want me to work all night?
- She's really not calling

377
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,532
If you turn in the work
already edited like this

378
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,330
what am I supposed to do?

379
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,631
I didn't mean to...

380
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,034
Don't try to explain

381
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,032
Hey, Yun Hwa!

382
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,435
What're you...

383
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,240
You call this crap, writing?

384
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,507
Who told you to write it like this!

385
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,121
Did I say you could do that?

386
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,420
If you can't take it then get out!

387
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,823
That goes for all of you

388
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,934
He doesn't appreciate great work

389
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,335
Where were you?

390
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,442
What's this?

391
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,209
Resignation?

392
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,414
Just for that?
Are you making a statement?

393
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,713
It's not that at all

394
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,914
Good vocabulary but too long

395
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,024
But, sir...

396
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,717
Next time when you write an article

397
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,727
use your own words, understand?

398
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,229
If I didn't throw that fit
they'll think I was favoring you

399
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,926
and who knows
what they'll do

400
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,038
Here, go and mail this

401
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,732
But I quit...

402
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,537
Don't just stand there
get going

403
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,236
But I want to quit

404
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,315
Can you tell me
you won't regret it?

405
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,416
See, you can't!

406
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,818
Hurry, get going!

407
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,229
Miss Kim's at school
She's got finals

408
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,340
Next time just page once

409
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,607
Don't tie up my pager

410
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,518
Kyung-Hyun, go out
and get a cake, now

411
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,316
Why?

412
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,426
Today's Yun Hwa's birthday

413
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,228
No, not again

414
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,509
She's been down lately

415
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,215
Let's cheer her up

416
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,017
- Kyu ng-Hyu n
- Yes

417
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,626
You be the clown today
and cheer her up...

418
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,423
Sure, I've done this
many times in school

419
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,428
What?

420
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,827
I mean, Okay

421
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,729
She's coming!

422
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:50,935
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

423
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:56,138
Happy birthday dear, Yun Hwa

424
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,408
Happy birthday to you

425
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,618
Go on, blow out the candles

426
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,416
Blow the candles

427
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,421
Blow out the candles!

428
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,424
Happy Birthday!

429
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,045
Miss Song, I'm sorry, but...

430
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:28,736
Miss Song

431
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,313
Oh that idiot

432
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,609
Now, she'll be pissed for a year

433
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,814
Miss Song

434
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,925
Miss Song

435
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,125
Wait, I'm sorry, really

436
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,627
I didn't mean to upset you, it's just

437
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,527
We always use to do this
to our friends...

438
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,633
Miss Song

439
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,542
I even got a present ready...

440
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,519
Entertainment World...

441
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,923
Yes... alright

442
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,428
- How's my column?
- It's out already?

443
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,635
Yun Hwa's came out

444
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,334
Good job, everyone

445
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,840
The boss is ecstatically happy
with this month's issue

446
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,637
Hey, you two!

447
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,804
Cherry called to thank you
for the pretty column

448
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:41,112
And I'm stormed with calls from
other actors asking for their interviews

449
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,517
Can you beat that
they're asking to be interviewed

450
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,123
Really, that many calls?

451
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,123
Just a figure of speech

452
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,626
Personally, I'm not happy
that you did it on your own

453
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,424
- But, good work
- Sir, phone call

454
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,725
It's Bobae's manager

455
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,736
See, what'd I tell you
Yes, this is Entertainment World...

456
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,433
You haven't spoken to me
for a whole week

457
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,837
Did you know?

458
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,011
Have you ever thought about

459
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,811
wearing contact lenses?

460
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,616
From a professional view

461
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,724
your glasses don't look good
on your face

462
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,932
I'm not trying to pick up on her

463
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,315
Take off your glasses

464
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,919
Please, just once

465
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,815
Please, Let me just see

466
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,518
Look, you don't even have
bad eyes

467
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,822
Stop it!

468
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,836
That temper!

469
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:17,011
If that skinny Cherry
could look that good

470
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,911
Boebae's gonna look great, right?

471
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,119
Right?

472
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,518
Let's hurry and get it over with

473
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,221
You're just gonna take pictures?
What about the interview?

474
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,126
Interview her

475
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,635
Why do you want to act?

476
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,036
I like living the lives
of different people

477
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,234
What do you do
in your spare time?

478
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,540
When I have time
I read, or see a movie

479
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,614
and try to learn new stuff

480
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,120
Are you seeing anyone?

481
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,222
This isn't right...

482
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,517
Are you interviewing her
or harassing her?

483
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,716
Bobae, smile, please...

484
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,419
That's good

485
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,934
Which poetry will go
with this one?

486
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,834
My picture is going to be
a work of art, again

487
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,235
Art

488
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,814
How about you writing
the article this time?

489
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,506
What?

490
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,515
I heard you're a good writer

491
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,711
The boss said that
you're the best writer

492
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,321
in the office

493
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,819
Why are you
looking at me like that?

494
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,823
Why are you so nosy?

495
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,420
Who, me?

496
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,624
He's told me, I never asked

497
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,830
Let me see...

498
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:52,840
Here, take it

499
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:59,009
Your birthday present

500
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,516
Just waited for the right moment

501
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,919
Oh gee... You just take it

502
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,116
and say 'thank you'

503
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,726
Then I could say, 'my pleasure'

504
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,225
See?

505
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,624
Here

506
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:15,830
Miss Song!

507
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,528
The subway is this way

508
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,216
- We're back
- Kyung-Hyun!

509
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,220
- Right on time!
- Why?

510
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,416
I've got a story
and I need some shots

511
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,321
Huh?

512
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,623
She doesn't want me

513
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,128
She wants a healthy bachelor

514
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,028
Hurry, we're gonna be late

515
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,731
A guy called while you were out...

516
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:57,932
When?

517
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,440
About an hour ago...

518
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,636
Did he leave a name?

519
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,906
No, he just hung up

520
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,016
So, I don't know

521
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,327
Honey, it's done

522
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,826
Okay

523
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,727
Delicious!

524
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,029
Did you cancel the noodles?

525
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,230
The line's been busy
I'll do it when he delivers

526
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,610
Did you order noodles?

527
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,416
We want to cancel

528
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,614
I hate customers like you

529
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,829
Noodles, anyone?

530
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,131
Scene Six, two, one!

531
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,331
Cut!

532
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,238
That was good, but...

533
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:10,905
The psychological aspect
is pretty weak

534
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,916
It's weak, that's what! mean

535
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,418
Think of Immanuel Kant
all psychology!

536
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,613
You know, Kant!

537
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,417
Get it?

538
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,222
- Change the pasta!
- Hi

539
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,921
Let's start the interview

540
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,431
I heard this movie is different from

541
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,036
the conventional
romantic comedies of Korea

542
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,229
Something new and
innovative and with a statement

543
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,137
- Can you explain?
- You're only too kind

544
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,038
I wanted to be more honest

545
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,645
Romantic comedies used to
sell like hot cakes

546
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,508
For a short time

547
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,115
Men, women
comedy, romance

548
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,615
They don't work anymore

549
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,721
Shakespeare, Kant
Amuro Namie

550
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,416
- They're all gone
- Oh, yes...

551
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,026
Men, women, desires, sex...

552
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,324
The point here is that fashion
is deceptive

553
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,728
and the future of mankind is grim

554
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,129
We need to advance

555
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,032
That's why we need noodles

556
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,140
The dialectical
materialism of paradigm

557
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,438
God!
Calling themselves 'artists'

558
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,443
- Let's go!
- Go where?

559
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,810
Let's take a breather

560
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,610
We're gonna be caught in traffic

561
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,016
Let's get something to eat first

562
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:29,222
Let's go out for some ribs

563
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,419
- sashimi
- Yun Hwa, are you coming?

564
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,723
Let's go out for drinks

565
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,923
Not today
My wife...

566
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,931
I'll go with you

567
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,916
Did Kyong-hee leave, already?

568
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,715
She didn't come back

569
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,221
Aren't you going home?

570
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,221
Yes

571
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,122
What's wrong?
You're usually the first one out

572
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,422
- Hello?
- Hello? Miss Yun Hwa Song?

573
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,024
Speaking
Who is this?

574
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,127
- It's the video store
- So?

575
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,424
Can you return the videos, please?

576
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,122
You called me for that?

577
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,530
Well, no one's answering
at your home!

578
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,728
Must I call you morning
and night for the videos?

579
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,430
Did you call this afternoon, too?

580
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:53,339
Sure did! I'm not gonna stop
until I get my tapes

581
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,514
Stop being so stupid
and pathetic!

582
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:07,113
Stupid!

583
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,628
Aren't you eating?

584
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,133
Huh? Yeah

585
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,239
Indigestion from lunch

586
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,640
You seem to like fish!

587
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,640
Yes

588
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,510
Do you have a girlfriend?

589
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:36,313
Used to have many
but got rid of them all

590
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,420
Why?

591
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:42,117
Kind of got boring
and just wasn't for me

592
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,420
You talk like an expert

593
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,621
I've become quite the expert

594
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,631
Ask me anything about love

595
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,325
You're that sure?

596
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,936
You said it

597
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,333
See those two behind us?

598
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,740
They'll break up in a month

599
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,609
and the next table over

600
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:08,411
those four are all hot
for the other's partners

601
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:12,420
You can tell by their eyes

602
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,023
Poor souls...

603
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,127
One more side order, please!

604
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,525
And a bottle of Soju

605
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,635
Where is she?
What happened to our date?

606
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,930
She thinks this is fun

607
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,336
Fool

608
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,607
you have a wife and beautiful kids
what are you doing?

609
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,117
Whew!

610
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,431
I think you've had enough

611
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,128
I'm fine
It's only my 10th glass

612
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,535
Ifl don't have one more

613
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,541
I'll be fine

614
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:09,339
You know how many shots
it takes you to get drunk?

615
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,412
Sure

616
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,417
Have you ever slept with a girl?

617
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,214
Huh?

618
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,324
Where did that come from?

619
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,619
Yes or a no

620
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,329
Someone as old as me?

621
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:31,434
Who, which one?

622
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,731
Someone I was in love with...

623
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:38,638
You slept with her
because you loved her?

624
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:39,834
Sleepy?

625
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,537
Why're you giving me
the first degree?

626
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,812
Tell me, I'd understand

627
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,214
Well...

628
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,124
I feel that... someone...

629
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:58,718
You know so many ups and downs...

630
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,229
Do we need to discuss this?

631
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,028
Go on

632
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,638
Your glass is empty
Here...

633
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,640
Cheers!

634
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,312
Go on

635
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,914
Well, in the end it's the same thing

636
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,817
The problem involves morals

637
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:28,322
but the way people are nowadays

638
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,519
you just don't know what to think

639
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,530
What are you smirking at, fool!

640
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,838
Move your legs...

641
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:47,844
Now the head

642
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,616
Wake up!

643
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,916
Where's your house?

644
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,923
You!

645
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,518
You're no better

646
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,724
I've been in love too

647
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,032
But...

648
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:23,909
I like you
You're under my spell now

649
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:31,016
Nobody can get out of that
You're mine now

650
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,635
Hold on

651
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,136
Hello?

652
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,246
Hello?
Is this Kyong-hee's phone?

653
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,814
Yes, it is. Who is it?

654
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:02,715
- I'm just...
- Wait is this...

655
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,331
I'm hot

656
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,138
Please, now...

657
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:28,937
Wait...

658
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,706
Now...

659
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:32,806
Hurry...

660
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,232
Honey...

661
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,338
What?

662
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:58,532
You look beautiful tonight

663
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,540
Just tonight?

664
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,009
Here, eat

665
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,119
No, you go ahead, dear

666
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:15,716
We haven't done this since
I was pregnant with our youngest

667
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:16,917
That long, really?

668
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:18,828
Thank you, dear

669
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:19,826
For what?

670
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,624
For remembering me...

671
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,633
Why don't you order some more

672
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,638
Oh my legs...

673
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,541
What am I doing here?

674
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,811
- What are you doing?
- I know, I know

675
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:44,512
I don't have time for games

676
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,020
Games?

677
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,418
Hurry, move your car!

678
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,822
Can't you see how far
I've pushed my car?

679
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,929
- Let me get some air
- I don't care how far you pushed it

680
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,327
Just pay and move your car!

681
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,830
Gosh

682
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,733
Hold your horses
I'll move!

683
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:04,329
See, it's here!

684
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,506
You're no friend!

685
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:18,712
How could you drive around on
an empty tank and no cash?

686
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,915
What were you thinking?

687
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,321
And look at you!

688
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,328
Shit happens...

689
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,437
I'll pay you back, all of it

690
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,436
I'll pay you back, all of it

691
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,414
No lipstick?

692
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,820
Didn't you like the color
I got for you?

693
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,716
I picked it

694
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,923
What kind of man are you?

695
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,035
Leaving a girl there alone!

696
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,637
Sleep well?

697
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,036
What do you take me for?

698
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:47,838
Good morning

699
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,536
Did you get a good night rest?

700
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,617
You have a call

701
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,309
- I'll take it in my room
- Yes

702
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,513
Kyong-hee, see me later

703
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:10,031
During dinner, she drank
a little too much and...

704
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,930
Good work!

705
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,435
Don't worry
You can afford it

706
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,029
It's our tradition for the newcomer
to buy lunch

707
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,735
Who's worried

708
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,435
Enjoy yourselves

709
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,705
Kyung Hyun!

710
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,806
That 'air cleaning' is fantastic

711
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,112
Have you tried it?

712
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,920
My dry cleaner doesn't
have that service

713
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,030
It's a kiss

714
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,730
What are you saying?

715
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,337
I thought it about it all night

716
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:52,238
But as a husband...
and father

717
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,607
I must stay with my family

718
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,918
I'm sorry

719
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:06,216
But this is best for both of us

720
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,415
Do you really mean it?

721
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:09,525
Yes

722
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,727
I mean it

723
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,531
Okay, have it your way

724
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,727
Aren't you mad?

725
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,428
Upset? For what?

726
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,535
Anything more?

727
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,041
Are you really okay?

728
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,909
I told you before
To let me know and you did

729
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,213
Gee, that was easy

730
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,322
- Coffee, anyone? Bring change?
- Yes

731
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,625
Uh, I...

732
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,930
Did you say something?

733
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,139
What is it?

734
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,138
You can tell me

735
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,234
Here...
