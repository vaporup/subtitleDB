1
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,055
<i>As I was going up the stair</i>

2
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,220
<i>I met a man who wasn't there</i>

3
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,109
<i>He wasn't there again today</i>

4
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:35,440
<i>I wish
I wish he'd go away</i>

5
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,575
<i>Where did you learn that?</i>

6
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,114
<i>Where did you learn that poem?</i>

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,617
<i>I made it up.</i>

8
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,245
<i>When I was a kid, I made it up.</i>

9
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,051
<i>What else do you remember
from back then?</i>

10
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:03,642
<i>Don't beat around the bush, doc.
Don't beat around the bush.</i>

11
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:08,854
<i>Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush, doc!</i>

12
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:14,440
<i>Tell me what you remember
about your mother.</i>

13
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,319
<i>I remember my mom.</i>

14
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,660
<i>I remember my mom.</i>

15
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,824
<i>I remember my mom was a whore.</i>

16
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:37,797
<i>How long would she k eep you there?</i>

17
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:43,015
<i>As long as she was busy.</i>

18
00:01:56,949 --> 00:02:00,199
<i>Do you understand
why you're talking with me now?</i>

19
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,946
<i>You're supposed to be good with...</i>

20
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,361
<i>...headaches.</i>

21
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,078
<i>I need something more than aspirin.
Know what I mean?</i>

22
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:13,297
<i>Do you remember the murders?</i>

23
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,209
<i>I remember...</i>

24
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:21,546
<i>...that Columbia is the capital
of South Carolina.</i>

25
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,719
<i>I remember that--</i>

26
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,317
<i>Are you the person
who murdered six residents...</i>

27
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,990
<i>...of the Lak eworth Apartments
on May 10,1998?</i>

28
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:49,991
<i>That's my birthday.</i>

29
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,505
<i>Who am I speaking to right now?</i>

30
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,716
<i>What should I call you?</i>

31
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:07,224
<i>Call me whatever you want.</i>

32
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,570
<i>Gary?</i>

33
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,447
<i>Gary?</i>

34
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,073
<i>Gary, you awak e?</i>

35
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:27,743
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact,
I am awake.

36
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,705
<i>I'm sorry to bother you at home...</i>

37
00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:33,124
...but there's gonna be a midnight
hearing in the Rivers case.

38
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:37,209
The defense found a notebook
misfiled in evidence, a diary.

39
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:40,299
They argued to the state Supremes
that it was suppressed.

40
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,920
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:46,381
There's no media.
This all happened under the radar.

42
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:48,965
The prisoner transport
left an hour ago from Ely.

43
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:52,310
<i>Left Ely? What do you mean?
What transport?</i>

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,315
The diary gave them an opening
to argue insanity again.

45
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:58,934
They need Rivers present, so they
drugged him, put him on a transport.

46
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,270
They're taking this scumbag
to a hearing...

47
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:03,274
...the night before his execution.

48
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,655
How the fuck did you let that happen?

49
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,656
<i>Would anyone lik e to play
another round?</i>

50
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:16,748
<i>Let's get another puzzle,
Vanna. What do we have?</i>

51
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:19,328
<i>-"Around the House" is the category.
-Buy a vowel.</i>

52
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:21,333
<i>-Buy a vowel.
-Pick up that trip.</i>

53
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,669
<i>-Buy a vowel, you idiot.
-I'd lik e to buy a vowel. An E.</i>

54
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,219
<i>One E.</i>

55
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,806
<i>-All right, 350 left.
-N.</i>

56
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,388
<i>-Buy a vowel.
-Buy another vowel.</i>

57
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,472
<i>-Yes!
-An I.</i>

58
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:43,940
<i>-I'd lik e to solve.
-Sure.</i>

59
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:45,573
<i>"Kibbles 'n Bits."</i>

60
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:52,617
She won't stop bleeding.
She won't stop bleeding.

61
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,119
-Jesus. What happened?
-An accident. We had an accident.

62
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:59,453
<i>Rain and lightning
is moving into Elk o.</i>

63
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,046
<i>Doppler Radar has pick ed up a
severe thunderstorm with lightning...</i>

64
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,624
<i>...on its way from Pershing
and Lander counties.</i>

65
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:08,554
<i>-We could get damaging winds...
-Four times 10 equals--</i>

66
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:10,003
<i>Four times 10--</i>

67
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:14,345
Timothy, could you not do that now?
We' re trying to hear about the storm.

68
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:18,138
-Sure you don't want me to drive?
-No.

69
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:23,060
I' ll get us to Anderson,
then you can take over after we eat.

70
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,904
Turn into spin.

71
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,402
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

72
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,163
Check mirror and gauge indicator
and roll...

73
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:41,034
...to a slow, smooth stop.

74
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,289
You okay, honey? Timothy?

75
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:50,046
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

76
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:57,846
-It's a shoe.
-What?

77
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:00,310
It's a shoe!

78
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,373
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

79
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:26,171
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

80
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:32,794
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

81
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:41,344
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

82
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,992
Shit!

83
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,745
-Why didn't we get a better spare?
-Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

84
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,498
Honey, don't get defensive.

85
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:10,255
Well, if the point is to put him,
Timothy, into the right school...

86
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:12,751
-...it's absurd to focus...
-George? George?

87
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,466
-...on replacement tires.
-What can I do to help?

88
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,388
Nothing. I'm fine, but...

89
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:21,928
...thank you.

90
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:53,667
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Alice?

91
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,298
Oh, my God! Alice?
What have you done?

92
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:04,016
What have you done?
What have you done?

93
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,940
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?

94
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,147
I have walked off the set, okay?

95
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,480
I know they' ll say
that I am in breach...

96
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,575
...but they clearly
did not read my deal.

97
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,069
They had me at a Ramada--

98
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,909
Oh, Jesus.

99
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,992
I think I have a spare battery
in my bag.

100
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,417
Excuse me?

101
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,634
I have a spare battery in my bag
up front, next to you.

102
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:41,259
-Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?
-The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

103
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:47,438
I don't see anything--

104
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:51,769
Just use your fucking eyes!
It's in the side pocket! Just look!

105
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:53,188
Jesus!

106
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:05,162
What have you done?
What have you done?

107
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:08,701
No, fool! If you help him,
you assume responsibility.

108
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:11,409
It is my responsibility.
Let go of me.

109
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:14,206
Alice? Alice?

110
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,589
What have you done?
What have you done?

111
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,506
Let me take a look.

112
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,973
The driver of every motor vehicle
involved in any manner of accident...

113
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:27,974
...originating from the operation
of a vehicle shall, within 10 days...

114
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:30,471
You got a towel or something
in the car?

115
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:33,318
Okay. Come help me look.

116
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,483
--within 10 days of the accident...

117
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:40,984
...if you are operating a vehicle
and it should, at any time, involve--

118
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,406
-Stay here. Keep her dry.
-It's okay. It's okay, honey.

119
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,828
-Open the door! We need the phone.
-No!

120
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,619
Sweetheart, it's okay.

121
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:53,502
Honey, it's okay.

122
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:59,708
-Give me the goddamn phone!
-The phone is dead, all right?

123
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:04,346
You're gonna be fine.
You' re gonna be okay.

124
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,896
No!

125
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,875
-She won't stop bleeding.
-Jesus. What happened?

126
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:39,835
There was an accident.
May I please use your phone?

127
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,045
-Please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.

128
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,638
Shit. I'm not getting a line.
It happens in the rain.

129
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,008
The phone doesn't work.

130
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:54,187
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.

131
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,353
Okay.

132
00:10:58,402 --> 00:11:00,560
You sit here, okay?

133
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,906
Keep pressure on the wound.
I' ll be back with an ambulance.

134
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,830
What are you doing?

135
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:20,254
Sorry. It's a step down
from the Ramada, but it' ll have to do.

136
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:22,416
I am not staying here.
Are you out of your mind?

137
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:27,420
This is my car. You work for me.
Get those bags back in this car now!

138
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:34,015
I understand the bleeding person
has a medical condition, but so do I.

139
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:39,692
My lung walls have depleted cilia.
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

140
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:47,612
No, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

141
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,195
Please!

142
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:58,914
Hey!

143
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,175
Stop. Please, please.

144
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,257
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.
Can I get a ride?

145
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:15,226
Okay.

146
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:35,327
You know you're going east.

147
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,491
Hospital's this way.

148
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:43,916
It's flooded.
I mean, it's a dead end.

149
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:47,673
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I gotta try.

150
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,801
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

151
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,850
Didn't you use to be that actress?

152
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,523
Yes.

153
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,449
-Wow.
-Now, is that a nice room?

154
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:20,997
Because though I am leaving soon,
I still would prefer a nice room.

155
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,205
Your nicest...

156
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:28,333
...if that is possible.

157
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,304
Eight's very cozy.

158
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,850
I tried to tell you.

159
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:53,904
Hey! Hey, stop!
There's no way through.

160
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:56,745
There's no way through!
No way through!

161
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,371
-Lou, wake up.
-What?

162
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,581
Cell phone.

163
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,742
-What?
-Do you have a cell phone?

164
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:04,329
Who wants to know?

165
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,708
There's been an accident,
a bad one. A lady's hurt.

166
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,752
-We need a cell phone right now.
-Dude, slow down.

167
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:14,425
First, we don't know who you are.
Second, we don't see an accident--

168
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:18,262
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really
fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

169
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:20,925
So if you have a cell phone,
give it to me now!

170
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:26,524
Dude, we don't have a cell phone,
so could you just let go of me now?!

171
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,861
I need you to give me a lift
in the other direction.

172
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,612
It's flooded that way too.
It's worse than this.

173
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,450
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.

174
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:41,699
Let them in.

175
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,806
Hey. How you doing?

176
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:10,317
-Phone still dead?
-Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

177
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:14,068
Stuck in a run-off two miles down
the road. The other way's fucked too.

178
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:16,231
The kids gave us a lift.
The girl was stranded.

179
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:19,197
-Is there another way out?
-Is she a hooker?

180
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:20,993
Hey! Is there a back road?

181
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:23,700
Where do you think the water's going?
You wouldn't get 500 feet.

182
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:27,492
-How's the woman?
-I don't know. They' re in number 4.

183
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:45,768
I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms
by the hour.

184
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:50,939
Funny. You still serving food?

185
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:55,189
Vending machines are around
the corner. Go ahead.

186
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:59,776
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with
picture lD. You need one room or two?

187
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:03,534
Excuse me. I was talking to you.
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

188
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,821
Well, I don't like looking at trash.

189
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:18,710
We' re a little stuck here, George.
I don't think we can get out tonight.

190
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:23,595
-She just keeps shaking.
-She's in shock.

191
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,174
-Let me take a look.
-What?

192
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,890
Let me take a look.

193
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:47,989
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

194
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,703
No.

195
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:56,422
Ginny, wait up.

196
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:02,085
Six.

197
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:05,348
At least we got a good number.

198
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:54,429
-Did you feel that?
-Feel what?

199
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,767
Cold.

200
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:12,324
Are you the manager?

201
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,491
Yeah.

202
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:19,747
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.
I'm transporting a prisoner here.

203
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,840
The law gives you the right
to refuse us service...

204
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,417
...but the roads are flooded.
I could use a room.

205
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:29,011
-It's an emergency.
-You got a radio in that car?

206
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:31,340
-Who's this?
-Limo driver, had an accident.

207
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:34,684
I got a lady pretty banged up.
I could use an ambulance.

208
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:37,689
Four-four-two requesting medical.

209
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:40,562
Four-four-two requesting medical.

210
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:43,487
Nothing. It's been like this
for the past hour.

211
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,062
She's losing a lot of blood.
Got a first aid kit?

212
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:47,616
Band-Aids, that's it.

213
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:50,357
-How about a needle and thread?
-Maybe in the diner.

214
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:55,080
I' ll get it. Locked up.
Stay dry.

215
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,871
I' ll be back with your key.
I'll put you in 10.

216
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:01,330
-Okay, thanks.
-What do you got back there?

217
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,629
Prison transfer.

218
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,133
Maybe when you get him situated,
come to 4 and look at the lady.

219
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,553
-I could use a second opinion.
-Yeah, sure.

220
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:21,233
Looks like you' re fucked.

221
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,390
Shut up!

222
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,038
-I wish I had beige.
-This is fine.

223
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,583
Would have been better.

224
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:45,542
I gotta get the officer situated.
Let me know if you need something.

225
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:47,709
I'll be right back.

226
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,720
Where did you learn to do that?

227
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:59,931
Pretty much where you' re standing.

228
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,616
Hey, is the...?

229
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:19,289
The little boy, is he all right?

230
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,914
He hasn't said a word
since the accident.

231
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:26,629
No, no, no. He doesn't talk much
ever since the...

232
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm his stepfather.

233
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:33,801
His father...

234
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,631
Two years ago, he left.

235
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:41,641
Little temper problem.

236
00:20:57,621 --> 00:20:59,660
Watch your step.

237
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,166
The furniture's for shit.

238
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,669
If you're fixing to cuff him to
something, the toilet's bolted down.

239
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:14,718
Thank you so much
for your assistance.

240
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:17,675
<i>-It's a good idea. Come on.
-I got stripes</i>

241
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:22,226
<i>Stripes around my shoulders
And these chains</i>

242
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,684
<i>These chains
They're about to--</i>

243
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,562
Let's go look at that lady.

244
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:37,322
-You get anyone?
-What?

245
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:41,029
-Did you get through?
-No, not yet.

246
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:48,961
Good stitch job.

247
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:54,718
Pulse is shallow, but steady.
Keep her comfortable.

248
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:57,377
We should take turns on the radio,
if that's all right.

249
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,719
No, it's not. I can manage.

250
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:19,909
You gonna arrest me, officer?

251
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:25,413
What?

252
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,868
How'd you do that?
How'd you know I was a cop?

253
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:35,755
No shit.

254
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,961
Cheetos for dinner, huh?

255
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,723
-That don't seem right.
-You got a better idea?

256
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:49,105
I worked mess in the service.
Maybe the diner's open. I could--

257
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:52,274
You got change for a dollar?

258
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:55,819
I don't know. Let me see.

259
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,571
Here you go.

260
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,959
You got a name?

261
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:15,083
-Paris.
-Paris, huh?

262
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:16,538
I' ll get it.

263
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:18,923
Never been.

264
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:22,261
Well, you ain't going tonight.

265
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,642
Please.

266
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:37,523
Please be strong.

267
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:41,987
You see, Timothy and I...

268
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,484
...we need you.

269
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,789
We need you so much.

270
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,425
Lou?

271
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:53,017
Lou?

272
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:27,137
You need to tell them, Harry,
that I can't work, I can't perform...

273
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:30,175
...I can't shine living
in an environment like that.

274
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:34,762
No, it is not about the money.
It's about the working conditions.

275
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:08,342
One bar.

276
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:10,880
One bar.

277
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:12,261
No bar.

278
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:14,803
One bar.

279
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:16,140
Two bars.

280
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:20,394
Come on. Come on.

281
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:22,816
Here we go.

282
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:27,989
There you go. Come on.

283
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:34,442
Goddamn desert wasteland!

284
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:46,335
Oh, shit! I just had it.

285
00:30:28,103 --> 00:30:30,890
Holy fuck.

286
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:04,252
-Jesus, Mother of God.
-Who is this?

287
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:07,716
The woman I was driving.

288
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:13,806
-What the hell are you doing?
-There's something in there.

289
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:16,105
-Use this, man.
-Thanks.

290
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:19,442
-Are you a cop?
-I was.

291
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:30,489
-She was in Room 10?
-I am.

292
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:36,253
-Where's your guy?
-Cuffed to a toilet.

293
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,464
Son of a bitch.

294
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:52,139
That was a fucking drive.

295
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:59,311
-Gentlemen.
-Your Honor.

296
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,400
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.

297
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:12,994
<i>In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada,
for the purposes of--</i>

298
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:18,789
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect,
we should wait till my client arrives.

299
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:23,204
-He has a right to be present.
-He has precious few rights.

300
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,293
He's 24 hours from execution.

301
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:29,388
But to demonstrate his
mental state, which is the purpose--

302
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:31,639
His mental state?

303
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,976
His mental state?

304
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,518
Do you know what time it is?
You think I got time for bullshit?

305
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:42,273
That the justices called me in the
middle of the night to review a case...

306
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:46,857
...I already sat on, that I already
decided, may make you happy.

307
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,108
But it pisses me off.

308
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:53,235
When your boy gets here, do what you
want, but in the name of decency...

309
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,987
...state your goddamn case!

310
00:32:57,835 --> 00:32:59,958
Yes, sir.

311
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:02,168
Somebody get me
a cup of coffee, black.

312
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:11,973
All right, everybody! Listen up!

313
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,557
There was an incident tonight.

314
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,849
That's police talk for,
"Someone's head got lopped off."

315
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,396
Larry!

316
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:22,809
-Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
-What?

317
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:26,733
-Who's Caroline Suzanne?
-The actress I was driving.

318
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,108
And where exactly did that happen?

319
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:33,533
We don't know, because
we can't find the body.

320
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,156
Not all of it anyway.

321
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:40,407
-What do you mean, you can't find it?
-Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

322
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,500
Officer Rhodes is outside.
He was transporting a convict.

323
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:47,246
-Who escaped.
-What are you--?

324
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:50,258
-Hold on.
-Running free!

325
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,836
Will you shut the fuck
up so he can talk?

326
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:55,968
This is my place, ho!
I'll say what I please!

327
00:33:56,142 --> 00:33:57,767
-It's safe here.
-It is not safe here!

328
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,845
-There's a cop here.
-Yeah, two cops.

329
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,681
Wait. You're a cop?

330
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,444
-I was. Shut up, Larry!
-It's not safe here! I'm not staying--

331
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,525
It's all right. It's okay.

332
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,239
Nothing.

333
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,614
-Is she okay?
-Ginny.

334
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:22,077
Ginny, will you...?
Stop it. Don't do this right now.

335
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,796
-What are you doing?
-Put your arm around your girlfriend.

336
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:30,044
-Actually, she's my wife.
-Everybody just stay here.

337
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:33,302
-Stay in this room.
-Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

338
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,097
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

339
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:38,799
-I'm not.
-All right. Larry?

340
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,387
-Come with us.
-Why?

341
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,562
-You know the place.
-Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.

342
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:46,305
I don't take orders from
a professional slut!

343
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,652
-Fuck you!
-Listen. Just stay here, please.

344
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,481
Keep everybody calm.

345
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,159
He's not gonna get too far.
Not in this!

346
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,953
Rhodes!

347
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:08,832
What are we chasing here?

348
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,511
Multiple homicide.

349
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:18,338
I'll go around this way.
Meet you in back.

350
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,607
Is that where you live
full-time? Las Vegas?

351
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,033
-Used to.
-What's that supposed to mean?

352
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:43,996
It means I don't live there anymore.

353
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:21,906
Maine!

354
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:27,156
We'll go see if we can use this one.
We'll go in here.

355
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:30,869
Since that wasn't a successful
attempt, we'll go in here.

356
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:35,708
I'll be right out here. It's okay.
I'm gonna stand guard.

357
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:40,753
Not a worry. I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

358
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:51,893
See, his mother usually does this.

359
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:17,713
Hey, Ginny. So how long
you two been married?

360
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:21,798
About nine hours. It was
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

361
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,138
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

362
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,976
-We need to leave!
-I was just talking to her.

363
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:30,552
Something's happening!
I need to get out of here!

364
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,973
-Ginny! Ginny!
-You don't own me, Lou!

365
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,441
I own what's inside you!
Half, at least.

366
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:41,530
You don't own any part
of me or my baby!

367
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,491
Then why did I marry you?

368
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:48,661
-Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
-Hey! Hey!

369
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,322
You guys, just calm down!

370
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:02,009
We are not leaving.
There is no place else to go.

371
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:06,176
There's a flood outside,
Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!

372
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:09,219
I'm not pregnant!

373
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,728
What did you just say?

374
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,853
I lied.

375
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:24,277
I'm not pregnant.

376
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:30,578
What are you talking about?
I saw the test.

377
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:37,287
Why would you do that to me?

378
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,507
Because Alison saw you at
The Hawk with that fucking girl!

379
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:50,846
-Ginny, what are we, like 15?
-Go away!

380
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:54,553
Goddamn!

381
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:16,915
-Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
-No!

382
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:19,921
I haven't been to The Hawk
in over a fucking year.

383
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:25,877
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore,
who likes fucking with your head.

384
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:28,341
Open the damn door, Ginny.

385
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:32,381
-Open the fucking door!
-Not until you calm down!

386
00:39:32,768 --> 00:39:36,600
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

387
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:48,772
What are you doing?

388
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:54,615
Lou?

389
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:13,134
Ginny, open this damn door!
Open the door!

390
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:16,429
-Open the door!
-Stop it, stop it!

391
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:22,058
Ginny, damn it, open the door!
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

392
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:24,641
Lou, please stop!

393
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:04,973
Lou?

394
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,563
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

395
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:53,525
Help me! Somebody help me!

396
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,907
Help me!

397
00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:07,744
Help me! Somebody help me!

398
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:11,837
Is he in there? Is he in there?

399
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:17,010
Ginny, are you okay?
What happened? What happened?

400
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:26,765
-Oh, shit.
-Jesus Christ.

401
00:42:35,115 --> 00:42:38,199
Lou? Lou?

402
00:42:39,328 --> 00:42:41,450
What's going on?

403
00:44:04,162 --> 00:44:05,537
What the hell?

404
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,535
Oh, shit!

405
00:44:12,795 --> 00:44:14,954
Come here!

406
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:33,471
They caught him. They caught him.

407
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:44,023
Why are we keeping him in here?

408
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:47,994
-Where would you prefer, Larry?
-I don't know.

409
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:50,916
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?
Did I tell you that?

410
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:55,828
They got in a fight! I tried to
get them to go back inside!

411
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:58,756
Should we try the radio again?

412
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:02,875
Larry, just stay here and watch him.

413
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:06,588
-Go back and look after Ginny.
-Where are you going?

414
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:09,601
Just do it, please.

415
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:11,722
Ed?

416
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:18,104
I don't know if I'm comfortable
with guard duty, per se.

417
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:21,944
He's unconscious, Larry.
He's tied to a post.

418
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,425
Timothy.

419
00:45:50,308 --> 00:45:52,384
Timothy.

420
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:04,155
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

421
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,815
I don't remember anything.

422
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:11,150
We had an accident.

423
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,618
George? Can you keep
an eye on Ginny for a minute?

424
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:21,120
She's awake now. I have
to get some aspirin to help her.

425
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:25,632
Darling, I gotta go get
something out of my room.

426
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,195
-Shit!
-What's wrong, buddy?

427
00:46:45,863 --> 00:46:47,655
What do you got in the fridge?

428
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:51,238
-You shut up.
-What's in there?

429
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:56,326
What's in there?

430
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,456
-What do you got in there?
-Shut up.

431
00:46:58,876 --> 00:47:00,703
What is it, huh?

432
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:02,622
-Shut up.
-You can tell me.

433
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:07,050
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I got a whopper myself.

434
00:47:26,404 --> 00:47:28,028
What are you doing?

435
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:29,645
Motherfucker!

436
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:33,656
-What are you doing out here?
-Getting shit that's mine.

437
00:47:33,828 --> 00:47:37,446
What are you doing?
What, I don't get to ask a question?

438
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:41,039
I'm taking photos. There's been two
murders. Before all the evidence--

439
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:45,338
That's not an answer. You're a limo
driver. What are you doing?

440
00:47:45,506 --> 00:47:49,420
Looking to win some "beyond the call
of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

441
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:52,927
You're not on the job anymore.
You don't need to be a hero.

442
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:55,422
There's a real, live,
active-duty cop outside--

443
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,434
The one who's managed to lose
a convicted killer?

444
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,771
You're a complicated cat, Edward.

445
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:06,271
No. Not really.

446
00:48:06,694 --> 00:48:08,935
I think so.

447
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:13,606
What month were you born?

448
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,077
-May.
-Taurus.

449
00:48:18,122 --> 00:48:19,948
Same as me.

450
00:48:23,252 --> 00:48:26,917
-Where were you a cop?
-Los Angeles.

451
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:30,631
Were you fired or did you quit?

452
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,298
I took medical leave.

453
00:48:33,804 --> 00:48:36,591
It was making me sick.

454
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:41,011
I burned out, I guess.
Wasn't up for it.

455
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:47,355
One day I got a call...

456
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:52,061
...for a jumper.

457
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:54,196
A young Mexican girl.

458
00:48:56,743 --> 00:49:00,195
Pregnant, infected with AIDS,
totally strung-out.

459
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:04,365
She was truly one of the doomed.

460
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,335
I asked her to come in off
the ledge and into my arms.

461
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:14,920
She asked me why
she should bother living.

462
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:23,640
What did you say?

463
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,517
I was trained
to tell her lots of things.

464
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:31,977
Her dreams, all the people
who'd miss her.

465
00:49:32,862 --> 00:49:35,733
But for a second, I hesitated.

466
00:49:36,866 --> 00:49:38,942
And she saw it.

467
00:49:42,163 --> 00:49:47,668
Within that second, I couldn't think of
one optimistic thing to say to her.

468
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:54,626
So she spread her arms
and jumped.

469
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:02,136
I started getting headaches...

470
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:07,602
...and eventually started blacking out.

471
00:50:08,856 --> 00:50:13,234
So I filed for medical.

472
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:31,208
What?

473
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:35,249
What is it?

474
00:50:39,595 --> 00:50:41,422
Rhodes!

475
00:50:41,597 --> 00:50:46,674
-It's worse. Nothing but static!
-Where's that key from the actress?

476
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,434
This was on the kid.

477
00:50:52,108 --> 00:50:54,895
-What is it, some kind of countdown?
-Larry!

478
00:50:57,446 --> 00:51:01,029
What the fuck is he doing?
Larry, come over here!

479
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,443
Come over here, man.
What are you doing? Come over here.

480
00:51:06,872 --> 00:51:09,956
-What are you doing?
-I just went to get something.

481
00:51:10,918 --> 00:51:14,618
We told you to watch the guy.
What are you doing in your office?

482
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:16,881
I just went to get something.

483
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:20,797
How many sets of keys are there
to this place? Look at me. How many?

484
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:23,377
-Two and a master set.
-Oh, my fucking God!

485
00:51:24,223 --> 00:51:30,641
Larry, you mother--! You son of a--!
Get the fuck in here! Get in here!

486
00:51:32,648 --> 00:51:35,269
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my con?

487
00:51:35,442 --> 00:51:40,318
Holy shit! Who did that?
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

488
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:42,113
Bullshit! You're lying!

489
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:46,150
-It's your bat sticking out of his throat!
-I know, but I didn't do it!

490
00:51:46,328 --> 00:51:48,071
Check the doors!

491
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:49,871
-I didn't do it!
-Look at him!

492
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,290
-Why'd you kill him?
-Why were you outside?

493
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,500
-Why'd you leave him?
-I was scared.

494
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:57,877
-What were you scared of?
-You wouldn't understand.

495
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,507
Try me.

496
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:01,466
-Why'd you kill my con?
-I didn't!

497
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:05,502
I don't know how--
I went to my office, that's all!

498
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,350
-Why'd you leave him?
-This your key? Number 8?

499
00:52:08,517 --> 00:52:11,186
Ten, nine, eight, huh?
This is your key!

500
00:52:11,353 --> 00:52:13,310
You can't say that!
Those aren't my keys!

501
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,434
That's like leading the witness
or something. Look.

502
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:20,308
These are my keys, okay?
These are my keys. You see?

503
00:52:21,863 --> 00:52:24,188
You got a Gucci wallet?
It's the actress's.

504
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:28,778
Yes, I took her wallet.
Afterwards. After she died!

505
00:52:28,954 --> 00:52:34,374
Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her.
And I didn't kill him.

506
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:39,288
-Let her go, Larry.
-Get back! You won't pin this on me.

507
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:41,503
-Timothy?
-Get him out of here!

508
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:45,043
-Put it down.
-I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

509
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,553
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!
If you take one more step--

510
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:51,048
Fuck!

511
00:52:59,234 --> 00:53:01,226
Get it off!

512
00:53:05,073 --> 00:53:06,187
Shit!

513
00:53:14,165 --> 00:53:16,917
Come on, you little bitch.
Please fucking start.

514
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:20,253
-Goddamn it!
-Hey!

515
00:53:21,172 --> 00:53:23,414
Larry, stop!

516
00:53:26,677 --> 00:53:28,053
What is going on?

517
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:30,921
-Larry!
-Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

518
00:53:34,268 --> 00:53:36,938
Timothy! Timothy!

519
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,785
An insanity plea was
refused by the court...

520
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:06,458
...despite the fact that my client
is a certifiable Axis lV dissociative.

521
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:11,296
To this day, he remains unaware of
the crimes for which he was convicted.

522
00:54:11,472 --> 00:54:17,261
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled
decisively that states cannot execute...

523
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:20,686
...a person who does not understand
why he's being put to death.

524
00:54:20,856 --> 00:54:22,136
He signed a confession.

525
00:54:22,316 --> 00:54:25,851
-He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
-Thirdly...

526
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:31,532
...Malcolm's diaries found
misfiled in state evidence.

527
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,658
Your Honor, this notebook contains
entries made just before the murders.

528
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:41,160
Important to note are the spectacular
changes in handwriting style...

529
00:54:41,335 --> 00:54:43,126
...tone, point of view.

530
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:48,123
What you are looking at are the private
thoughts of several different people.

531
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,048
With permission,
Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

532
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,676
Thank you.

533
00:54:55,015 --> 00:54:58,715
Your Honor, there is no
universally efficacious treatment...

534
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:01,729
...for Dissociative ldentity Disorder.

535
00:55:01,897 --> 00:55:06,191
In theory, one attempts to move
the patient towards integration.

536
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:10,938
-A folding of their fractured psyche.
-Your Honor?

537
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:12,823
He's here.

538
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:32,886
No! What you saw was an accident!

539
00:55:33,053 --> 00:55:35,211
He ran out in front of me!
I'm not a murderer!

540
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:37,464
There's a dead body
in your freezer, Larry.

541
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,178
-I didn't kill him. I found him like that.
-Stop it!

542
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:43,851
Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last
month and I lost everything, okay?

543
00:55:44,022 --> 00:55:45,220
Everything!

544
00:55:45,398 --> 00:55:49,063
I drove west. I didn't know where
to go, but I was running on empty...

545
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:51,643
...so I pulled in here at this place.

546
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:56,151
And there was no one at the station,
so I came over to the office...

547
00:55:56,326 --> 00:55:58,117
...and I walked in.

548
00:55:58,286 --> 00:56:01,157
And there, sitting at that desk
right there, was the manager...

549
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:04,000
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!

550
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:07,452
-Heart attack or something.
-Banquet Potpie!

551
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:10,202
He'd been sitting there
for God knows how long.

552
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:14,426
All of a sudden, this auto-parts
salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

553
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:16,836
I didn't have a fucking dime...

554
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:19,586
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

555
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:24,095
I just took the key from the wall
and gave him a room.

556
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:28,564
Maybe that was wrong,
but I was broke, and that's what I did.

557
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:31,601
Then I came back in here...

558
00:56:32,195 --> 00:56:35,777
...and I moved Larry's body--
His name was Larry too.

559
00:56:35,948 --> 00:56:39,613
I put him in the freezer.

560
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:44,956
I wasn't trying to hide him.
It was hot out.

561
00:56:45,124 --> 00:56:49,703
I thought it was the best place for him
till his family or someone came along.

562
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:52,417
Only no one did...

563
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:55,633
...except more guests.

564
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:58,672
So I checked them in too.

565
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:02,088
And they all seemed happy...

566
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:04,935
...so I just stayed.

567
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:09,145
Cry me a river.
This is a total crock of shit!

568
00:57:09,315 --> 00:57:11,722
-No, it's not!
-Admit it, you killed him!

569
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:14,652
Just like you killed my con.
Just like you killed her husband.

570
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,489
Just like you killed his actress.
Just admit it.

571
00:57:17,656 --> 00:57:21,321
-Say it, "I killed them."
-Stop it! He can't take any more!

572
00:57:21,493 --> 00:57:25,076
Everything is okay now. Everything
is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.

573
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,991
-I don't know what we got.
-What?

574
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:29,621
We thought we got the guy
two hours ago, then--

575
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:32,165
You believe this shit?
It's him! It's this guy!

576
00:57:32,337 --> 00:57:34,460
He had a knife to your neck,
remember?

577
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:38,799
His story's so unbelievable,
I think it just might be true.

578
00:57:39,595 --> 00:57:41,005
She's got a point.

579
00:57:44,016 --> 00:57:46,174
You guys are crazy.

580
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:48,635
Maybe it's the burial ground.

581
00:57:50,522 --> 00:57:51,685
What?

582
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,522
Read the brochure in there.
It's all around us.

583
00:57:57,696 --> 00:58:00,816
A hundred years ago, the government
moved these lndians here.

584
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:04,194
They all died
because there was no water.

585
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:08,695
Now they're coming back to life
like sea monkeys, huh?

586
00:58:08,874 --> 00:58:10,831
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.

587
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:13,326
-Just take it easy, Rhodes.
-You know, you take it easy!

588
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:17,204
You've tried to run this show all night.
Giving orders, pointing fingers!

589
00:58:17,382 --> 00:58:20,383
You blamed my con for everything,
and he ends up dead.

590
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:23,553
I'm telling you, it's him!
We all saw him run down George.

591
00:58:23,722 --> 00:58:27,221
Your actress's wallet is right there.
She's dead, there's the wallet.

592
00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:30,227
-What more do you want?
-Stop it! Please shut up!

593
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:34,432
All right. You want a plan?
Here's the plan, okay?

594
00:58:34,608 --> 00:58:38,854
No one's gonna move. We'll stay
here, like this, in this room until dawn.

595
00:58:39,029 --> 00:58:41,187
No one leaves, no one moves.

596
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:44,318
And if he tries anything,
I'm gonna shoot him!

597
00:58:44,492 --> 00:58:47,696
And if something out there
comes in here, I'll shoot it!

598
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:50,741
And if anyone of us tries anything,
I'll shoot them!

599
00:58:50,915 --> 00:58:52,410
-We get it.
-Good!

600
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:28,698
Timmy? Timmy?

601
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:32,073
-You need to stay in here with us.
-It's all right.

602
00:59:38,796 --> 00:59:42,082
Remember that movie where
the 10 strangers went to an island...

603
00:59:42,258 --> 00:59:44,630
...and then they all died
one by one...

604
00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:49,179
...and then it turned out they weren't
strangers, they all had a connection?

605
00:59:49,348 --> 00:59:51,590
They all messed with the wrong guy,
and he was getting revenge.

606
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:53,143
Shut up!

607
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,980
I'm just saying maybe there's
a connection between all of us.

608
00:59:58,399 --> 00:59:59,727
Like what?

609
01:00:00,317 --> 01:00:03,318
-We're all in Nevada.
-Shut up!

610
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:09,193
Where were you going with your con
when you pulled in here?

611
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:14,411
Carson City. Okay?

612
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:19,996
I was going home to Florida.
Where were you going?

613
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,997
I was taking the actress to L.A.

614
01:00:22,381 --> 01:00:23,923
I was born in Florida.

615
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:27,760
Since you been in that chair,
no one's died, so shut up!

616
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:29,339
No one's died since we've
all been here!

617
01:00:29,513 --> 01:00:32,514
-Hey, sweetie, sit down.
-Where in Florida, Larry?

618
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:38,101
-Where in Florida?
-Friends now, huh? Great.

619
01:00:39,356 --> 01:00:42,690
-Polk County.
-That's where I was born.

620
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,185
-Which town?
-Mulberry.

621
01:00:45,362 --> 01:00:48,648
-Frostproof.
-No wonder you left.

622
01:00:48,991 --> 01:00:51,067
There's a town called Frostproof?

623
01:00:51,451 --> 01:00:55,366
They grow oranges.
The name doubles as a slogan.

624
01:00:55,539 --> 01:00:59,323
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.
Why would you wanna go back?

625
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:02,455
I found a grove for sale
on the lnternet.

626
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:05,963
Nine acres, 1200 trees.
Limes and oranges.

627
01:01:06,717 --> 01:01:10,299
According to the realtor, the soil
needs a few tills, phosphorous...

628
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:16,888
...lanes need reeding,
but it's real good land.

629
01:01:20,897 --> 01:01:22,724
What?

630
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,392
It sounds nice.

631
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,204
Ed?

632
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,925
She's dead.

633
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,946
Get him out of here.

634
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:18,786
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

635
01:02:25,545 --> 01:02:27,952
Look at this.

636
01:02:33,386 --> 01:02:36,802
-Where'd you get that?
-Right here.

637
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:45,307
This doesn't make any sense.
She died from an accident.

638
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:49,977
George was an accident,
if you believe Larry.

639
01:02:52,947 --> 01:02:55,319
Where is seven?

640
01:02:58,035 --> 01:03:00,028
Back it up!

641
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,949
-See, I told you it wasn't me!
-That's not possible.

642
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:45,200
I was standing right there. I saw what
happened. We all saw what happened.

643
01:03:45,374 --> 01:03:48,909
He ran out. Nobody could have
known he was gonna do that.

644
01:03:49,086 --> 01:03:50,366
No one human.

645
01:03:50,546 --> 01:03:53,037
We're back to that again?
It's the spirits, huh?

646
01:03:53,215 --> 01:03:57,260
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy
that Larry put in the freezer.

647
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:01,130
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!

648
01:04:01,306 --> 01:04:03,014
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.

649
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:05,092
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

650
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:07,510
Take her car and get out.
You, her and the kid.

651
01:04:07,688 --> 01:04:08,886
There's nowhere to go.

652
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:11,104
-How much gas do you have?
-Half a tank.

653
01:04:11,275 --> 01:04:13,397
You can drive till dawn on that.
Look at me.

654
01:04:13,568 --> 01:04:16,238
When you get to where it's flooded,
go the other way.

655
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:17,733
I don't know if I can.

656
01:04:17,906 --> 01:04:21,026
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.

657
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:22,232
Timmy.

658
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:25,032
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.

659
01:04:25,205 --> 01:04:26,368
What's going on?

660
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,248
-They can't leave!
-This way.

661
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:30,409
We'll see you
when the storm breaks.

662
01:04:30,585 --> 01:04:33,919
Hey! Hey! They can't leave!
Where are they going? Get back here!

663
01:04:34,089 --> 01:04:35,666
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.

664
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:37,216
-They're not leaving.
-Go!

665
01:04:37,384 --> 01:04:40,088
You can't let suspects leave
after four people have been killed!

666
01:04:40,262 --> 01:04:43,216
-You really think they're suspects?
-They're not leaving!

667
01:04:49,938 --> 01:04:51,480
Shit.

668
01:04:51,982 --> 01:04:53,855
Ginny!

669
01:04:55,819 --> 01:04:58,606
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

670
01:04:59,072 --> 01:05:01,444
-Fire extinguisher! Where?
-Back there!

671
01:05:24,597 --> 01:05:26,471
Nobody in there.

672
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:34,855
Maybe it got so hot,
they got cremated.

673
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:37,100
There'd be something left.

674
01:05:41,364 --> 01:05:42,739
You did this.

675
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:46,532
You did this!
You told them to get into the car!

676
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:48,161
Are you happy?

677
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:14,470
Where is he?

678
01:07:14,915 --> 01:07:16,077
Nothing.

679
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:24,581
I give up!

680
01:07:25,634 --> 01:07:28,255
I give up!
What the hell do you want?

681
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:32,758
What do you want, you sick bastard?
What the fuck do you want from us?

682
01:07:34,392 --> 01:07:38,141
I am turning 30 next week
and I just want to go home...

683
01:07:38,313 --> 01:07:40,056
...and grow oranges!

684
01:07:46,947 --> 01:07:49,651
It's your birthday next week?

685
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:52,742
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

686
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:55,616
Me too.

687
01:07:59,793 --> 01:08:01,203
Me too.

688
01:08:04,005 --> 01:08:05,797
Yeah.

689
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:10,630
George York, May 10.

690
01:08:10,804 --> 01:08:12,713
Alice York, May 10.

691
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:14,716
Caroline Suzanne, May 10.

692
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:18,305
Ginny and Lou lsiana, May 10.

693
01:08:18,478 --> 01:08:20,885
Me, Larry Washington,
May fucking 10.

694
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:24,768
What are the odds?
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

695
01:08:27,445 --> 01:08:28,643
What is it?

696
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,493
-Where's the fuse box, Larry?
-Other side of the building.

697
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,672
Ginny and Lou lsiana.

698
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:59,094
Virginia and Louisiana.

699
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,475
Caroline, Carolina.

700
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:05,348
Paris Nevada.

701
01:09:05,524 --> 01:09:07,149
George York.

702
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,518
Larry Washington.

703
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,694
Rhodes, Rhode lsland.

704
01:09:21,248 --> 01:09:23,822
Ed Dakota.

705
01:09:37,932 --> 01:09:42,392
<i>When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there</i>

706
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:44,933
<i>He wasn't there again today</i>

707
01:09:45,105 --> 01:09:46,979
<i>I wish
I wish he'd go away</i>

708
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:50,810
<i>Who is this?</i>

709
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,940
<i>Who am I speaking to right now?</i>

710
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,907
<i>Where did you learn that poem?</i>

711
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:01,485
<i>Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.</i>

712
01:10:01,663 --> 01:10:03,905
<i>Who am I speaking to right now?</i>

713
01:10:10,547 --> 01:10:11,745
Doc?

714
01:10:14,968 --> 01:10:17,257
-Edward?
-What's happening?

715
01:10:17,596 --> 01:10:20,265
-Please be quiet.
-He can hear what we're saying?

716
01:10:20,557 --> 01:10:22,929
Of course I can hear
what you're fucking saying.

717
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:28,178
Edward, you missed your last
appointment. Where have you been?

718
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:33,644
-Did I black out again?
-Try and think back.

719
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,276
Where have you been?

720
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:39,117
All right.
I was driving this actress...

721
01:10:39,618 --> 01:10:44,778
...and we got stuck at the motel.
There was a storm.

722
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:48,376
We couldn't get out
because of the storm.

723
01:10:48,543 --> 01:10:50,702
What happened at the motel?

724
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:56,300
People started dying.

725
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:59,469
And then their bodies--
It didn't make any sense.

726
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:01,381
They disappeared.

727
01:11:03,933 --> 01:11:06,603
Edward, I'd like to show
something to you, if I may.

728
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,307
Do you recognize this man?

729
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:17,648
No.

730
01:11:18,323 --> 01:11:21,158
That man, Edward,
is Malcolm Rivers.

731
01:11:21,326 --> 01:11:24,908
He's had a very troubled life.
He was arrested four years ago...

732
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,448
...and convicted of the murder
of six people in a violent rampage.

733
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,158
-He did this.
-Detective, please.

734
01:11:31,336 --> 01:11:32,960
Edward, listen to me.

735
01:11:33,338 --> 01:11:39,257
When faced with an intense trauma,
a child's mind may fracture...

736
01:11:39,427 --> 01:11:43,010
...creating disassociated identities.

737
01:11:43,806 --> 01:11:47,222
That's exactly what happened
to Malcolm Rivers.

738
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:49,801
He developed a condition
that is commonly known...

739
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:52,850
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.

740
01:11:58,112 --> 01:12:00,021
Why are you telling me this?

741
01:12:01,324 --> 01:12:03,565
Because you, Edward...

742
01:12:03,743 --> 01:12:06,862
...are one of his personalities.

743
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:13,000
What?

744
01:12:27,558 --> 01:12:30,844
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
did you do to my face?

745
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,728
-Keep calm.
-Where is my face?

746
01:12:32,897 --> 01:12:35,388
-That is your face.
-Why am I tied up?

747
01:12:35,566 --> 01:12:37,144
-Keep calm.
-Where is--?

748
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:38,860
-Please.
-Jesus Christ!

749
01:12:39,028 --> 01:12:41,186
-Where is my face?
-Stay calm.

750
01:12:41,363 --> 01:12:45,064
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!
Why am I tied up like this?

751
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:48,694
Who are all these people?
What happened at the motel?

752
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:51,907
-Where is everybody?
-They don't exist, Edward.

753
01:12:52,082 --> 01:12:54,656
You were all created
by Malcolm as a child.

754
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:57,243
-You're a liar!
-Consider what you know.

755
01:12:57,421 --> 01:12:59,746
-Everyone named after a state.
-No.

756
01:12:59,923 --> 01:13:03,423
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.

757
01:13:03,594 --> 01:13:05,052
No! I was a cop!

758
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,921
I was a cop in the Rampart Division
of L.A.P.D. for six years.

759
01:13:09,099 --> 01:13:10,130
Edward, please.

760
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:12,716
I live in Hollywood,
in a studio apartment.

761
01:13:12,895 --> 01:13:15,267
-You don't live there.
-I do live there!

762
01:13:15,522 --> 01:13:17,266
You don't live anywhere.

763
01:13:17,608 --> 01:13:21,688
I know this is difficult to accept,
but the face you saw in that mirror...

764
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:27,152
...is the face I've always seen when
I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...

765
01:13:27,326 --> 01:13:29,283
...or anyone else you've met tonight.

766
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:33,367
Malcolm is in the midst
of a medical treatment.

767
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:39,127
One which forces all his identities to
confront one another for the first time.

768
01:13:39,296 --> 01:13:41,787
I knew there would be violence...

769
01:13:41,965 --> 01:13:47,208
...and with it, the number
of the identities would be reduced.

770
01:13:49,556 --> 01:13:51,465
Reduced?

771
01:13:51,641 --> 01:13:54,428
One of the personalities
you've met tonight, Edward...

772
01:13:54,603 --> 01:13:57,473
...committed those murders
four years ago.

773
01:13:57,856 --> 01:14:01,640
He took control of Malcolm's body,
as you have now...

774
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:06,978
...and released an unspeakable rage.
And in 19 hours...

775
01:14:07,157 --> 01:14:10,739
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death
because of those actions...

776
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:14,778
...unless I can convince that man...

777
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:17,328
...that the killer is gone.

778
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:23,036
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?

779
01:14:23,214 --> 01:14:26,500
I need your help.
I need your help to finish this.

780
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:28,837
Edward, listen to me.

781
01:14:30,096 --> 01:14:31,804
<i>Edward, stay with me.</i>

782
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:34,844
Listen to me.
I need you to understand.

783
01:14:35,018 --> 01:14:38,184
The killer cannot survive.

784
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:39,599
Edward!

785
01:15:06,799 --> 01:15:08,341
Got it?

786
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:12,968
I can't see a thing.
Is there a flashlight?

787
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:14,763
Hang on. Hang on.

788
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:19,014
-You got a flashlight?
-Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.

789
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:05,266
Shut up!

790
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,150
Hey. What am I
supposed to wear, man?

791
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:16,234
You're in it.

792
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:28,994
Larry.

793
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,171
Larry, come here.

794
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:41,183
Ed!

795
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:51,519
Ed!

796
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,749
Larry!

797
01:17:12,757 --> 01:17:15,675
-Larry!
-Paris.

798
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:17,793
Paris.

799
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:22,473
Larry?

800
01:17:25,603 --> 01:17:28,521
Larry? Larry?

801
01:17:31,609 --> 01:17:34,361
Where are the keys to the truck?

802
01:17:34,529 --> 01:17:36,652
Where are the keys to the truck?

803
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:43,952
-That was good, Larry.
-We gotta get out of here.

804
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:47,158
-Ed has the keys to the truck.
-I got a spare right here.

805
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:50,287
-Where is he?
-I don't know. Here.

806
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:54,213
-What are you doing?
-We need a gun.

807
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:56,420
Holy shit!

808
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:01,886
Give me the keys to the truck.

809
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:03,615
Ed!

810
01:19:03,784 --> 01:19:05,658
We gotta get out of here!

811
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:08,116
-Paris--
-He's coming. He's--

812
01:19:08,288 --> 01:19:10,614
-Stay here.
-What's wrong with you?

813
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:13,543
Paris, listen to me.

814
01:19:13,711 --> 01:19:16,118
Stay here.

815
01:19:17,297 --> 01:19:19,504
It's gonna be okay.

816
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,700
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.

817
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:53,412
Throw me the keys to the truck.
Stay there. Stay there!

818
01:20:26,032 --> 01:20:29,781
Ed! Ed! Ed!

819
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:37,497
Ed, let me see.

820
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:39,377
We gotta get you to a hospital.

821
01:20:39,546 --> 01:20:41,669
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

822
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,710
Stay with me because
I'm gonna get you to the truck.

823
01:20:44,884 --> 01:20:48,549
Put your arm around my neck.
You gotta hold on, okay?

824
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:54,392
You with me, Ed? Stay with me.
Okay. One, two, three.

825
01:20:55,436 --> 01:20:59,766
You gotta help me get you up.
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.

826
01:21:01,734 --> 01:21:05,068
Ed, why won't you let me help you?

827
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:08,232
Where did you go before?

828
01:21:08,408 --> 01:21:12,191
What did you see?
Tell me what you saw.

829
01:21:15,164 --> 01:21:17,738
I saw you.

830
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:25,087
I saw you in an orange grove.

831
01:21:54,954 --> 01:21:57,789
<i>Why won't you let me help you?</i>

832
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:01,283
<i>Where did you go?</i>

833
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,536
What did you see?

834
01:22:06,882 --> 01:22:09,171
I saw you...

835
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:14,261
...in an orange grove.

836
01:22:50,425 --> 01:22:55,716
The question, Your Honor, is whether
to convict the body or the mind.

837
01:22:56,348 --> 01:22:59,931
His body committed these murders,
that is true.

838
01:23:00,102 --> 01:23:02,343
The person who remains
inside did not.

839
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:04,098
Judge Taylor, that may not be true--

840
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:06,763
We witnessed the destruction
of 10 identities tonight.

841
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:08,650
Nine were innocent
and one was guilty.

842
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:09,850
They're not real!

843
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:12,353
The violence that existed in him
has been executed.

844
01:23:12,531 --> 01:23:17,192
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs
in a state hospital.

845
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:26,367
<i>In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is
the recommendation of this court...</i>

846
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:29,214
<i>...that Mr. Rivers' execution
be stayed.</i>

847
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:33,212
<i>I am transferring Mr. Rivers
to state psychiatric services...</i>

848
01:23:33,593 --> 01:23:36,547
<i>...under the care of Dr. Mallick.</i>

849
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:57,149
<i>Crack ed heels and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn</i>

850
01:23:57,325 --> 01:24:01,619
<i>But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you</i>

851
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:04,076
<i>I want you</i>

852
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,455
<i>I want you</i>

853
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:10,873
<i>I want you so bad</i>

854
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:25,237
Timmy.

855
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,482
No, please don't.

856
01:25:56,902 --> 01:26:00,650
No, Timmy, please.

857
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,779
What is it, Malcolm?

858
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,531
Malcolm?

859
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,867
Whores don't get a second chance.

860
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:35,349
<i>When I was going up the stairs</i>

861
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:39,355
<i>I met a man who wasn't there</i>

862
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,232
<i>He wasn't there again today</i>

863
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:46,355
<i>I wish
I wish he'd go away</i>

864
01:29:59,184 --> 01:30:00,215
