1
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,959
Look, look! They're shooting at us.

2
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,593
Fire!

3
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,712
It's just a dragon dance!
Return to your posts!

4
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,788
Start drumming!

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,713
Master Wong,
watch out for the gunfire!

6
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,038
- Can you make it?
- Yes!

7
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,832
Give me the tail!

8
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,917
"Monumental Bravery"

9
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,235
"Limitless Trust"

10
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,955
Look over there, Wong Fei-Hung...

11
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,998
more and more foreign ships
are anchoring in our docks.

12
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,229
Britain was given Hong Kong,
Portugal was given Macao,

13
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,311
Russia occupies Hak Lung Gong.

14
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,108
Our country is divided
and I'm being sent to Vietnam

15
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,918
to fight the French.

16
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,598
How will the Vietnamese
react to this plaque here

17
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,113
that says "Our land, our people"?

18
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,110
- Step forward!
- Yes, Your Excellency!

19
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,077
Take it down! Quick!

20
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,911
Wait a minute!

21
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,230
Excellency, the Government
changes its policies so often

22
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,389
you could be called back soon.

23
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,475
The Government is factionalised,
and has reduced my army.

24
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,552
I fear that, while I'm gone,

25
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,154
the men that remain here
will be dismissed.

26
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,829
You're the chief trainer
of my Black Flag Army.

27
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,795
I hope you'll organise them
into a local militia.

28
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,351
So that if China comes under foreign
attack, they can defend it.

29
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,072
Master Wong...

30
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,550
Get up!

31
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,548
Excellency, don't worry!
I hope you'll return soon.

32
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,435
Wong Fei-Hung,

33
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,829
the unjust treaties forced upon us
are written on this fan.

34
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,149
When you see it, think of me.

35
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,790
When I return, I hope the treaties
will have been erased.

36
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,798

Here they come.

"God Loves the World"

58
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,190
What are you talking about?

59
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,678
The town's full of foreigners.

60
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,639
You're very smart
to do business with them.

61
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,315
I couldn't make it in China,
so I went to England.

62
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,153
Let's take a photo
with Chu's pet bird.

63
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,196
What an honour
for our feathered friend!

64
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,678
Don't mention it.

65
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,751
- Let's take your picture, too!
- Thank you very much.

66
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,438
- Master Wong!
- How is everyone?

67
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,873
Fei-Hung!

68
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,678
Great Uncle, it's been a while.
You're looking good.

69
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,673
Thank you!
Fei-Hung, see who I brought with me?

70
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,552
Master Wong! Had tea yet?
Everyone's waiting for you.

71
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,480
- 13th Aunt.
- Fei-Hung!

72
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,077
- She wants to shake your hand.
- It's a foreign custom.

73
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,434
Let me introduce you.
This is Joanna.

74
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,833
"Do"?

75
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,990
She's asking how do you do?

76
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,788
- Say, "Thank you."
- Oh, "kill you."

77
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,312
You're welcome.

78
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,517
Fei-Hung, let's take a photo
with the bird. OK?

79
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,708
Sit down...

80
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,269
- Fei-Hung, taking photos is simple.
- How does it work?

81
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,349
Look there.

82
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,236
Don't move...

83
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,471
or the photo won't look good.

84
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,392
Ready! One, two, three!

85
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,553
What happened?

86
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,393
That's boiling water!

87
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,674
- Are you OK? Are you hurt?
- I'm all right!

88
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,796
This foreign game is too dangerous.

89
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,597
Too much powder.

90
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,909
- You told me not to move!
- Are you all right?

91
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,796
Grand Uncle,
I'm glad you asked me here

92
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,836
or you could've ended up
like the bird.

93
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,875
True.

94
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,878
Chu!

95
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,436
I'll go back to England
in a few days.

96
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,751
Yee was in England,
but she insisted on coming back.

97
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,548
At least this way, she won't mix
with those foreigners any more.

98
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,436
- Take care of her for me.
- Take care of her?

99
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,671
Chu, say something.
You're scaring me!

100
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,273
Anyone here?

101
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,912
I'm looking for Master Wong.

102
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,839
Is anyone here?

103
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,107
Who is it? What's up?

104
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,195
- I'm from May County.
- M... ay... May... May.

105
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,238
I'm Leung Foon.
I want Master Wong to teach me.

106
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,916
- He...
- He's not here?

107
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,316
- I...
- You?

108
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,312
- I am...
- You are...!

109
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,635
- Wong... Master Wong...
- You're Master Wong?

110
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,837
- No... yes!
- Ah, so you're Master Wong?!

111
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,913
I was practising kung fu on my cows,
when one kicked my arm.

112
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,876
Please take a look.

113
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,908
Good!

114
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,152
Not that one, this one.

115
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,154
Master Wong, why are you plastering
my leg? I only hurt my arm.

116
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,317
Too... late... now!

117
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,673
It's stiff, Master. Why is it stiff?

118
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,554
Are you... all right?

119
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,792
Oh, I get it!
You want to teach me kung fu?

120
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,595
- Roll? You want me to roll?
- I said no, not roll.

121
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,912
I'm good. Even in plaster
I can move like lightening.

122
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,557
Not a bad stance.

123
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,239
Still not good enough?
I'll keep trying!

124
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,275
I'll show you a few more rolls.

125
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,432
What's all this noise?

126
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,115
- Who's he?
- Master is teaching me kung fu!

127
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,115
Buck Teeth So
is teaching you kung fu?

128
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,589
- Who are you?
- Buck Teeth So!

129
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,398
You're not Master Wong?

130
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,352
Buck Teeth So? Who are you?

131
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,360
- He is Master Wong's student.
- And who are you?

132
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,955
I'm also Master Wong's student, Kai.
What happened to you?

133
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,668
Don't ask. I have to get back
to the theatre. I'm off.

134
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,313
I'm off before he plasters
my other side.

135
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,390
Foon, have you finished mending
that hole in the roof?

136
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,513
The show will start soon!

137
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,797
I'm here to act,
and you make me fix the roof.

138
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,950
It's not fair! I'm scared of heights.

139
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,429
If you can't play this role
how do I know you can act?

140
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,990
When I'm famous, I'll send you
up here to mend the roof.

141
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,912
What are you doing? Sommersaults?
What are you playing at?

142
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,195
I thought it was the ship's cannon.

143
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,072
You wish! It's only thunder.
Cannon fire is good luck.

144
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,673
Maybe we'll all go
and mine gold in America.

145
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,798
Then we wouldn't have to suffer here.
Country bumpkins... so stupid!

146
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,270
Don't move or you'll spoil it!
Are you ready?

147
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,191
A foreign woman speaking Chinese?

148
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,230
China will be taken over
by foreigners soon.

149
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,149
Wait for me!

150
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,437
- One, two...
- Wait for me!

151
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,357
Wait for you?

152
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,957
It's stuck!

153
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,116
- Foon, where the hell are you?
- I'm changing!

154
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,754
Hurry up! Don't be so lazy!

155
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,078
Foon, you brag about your kung fu.

156
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,913
You can't even climb the roof
to fix something.

157
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,356
You broke the stage
with a somersault.

158
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,794
You show me how to do it
if you're so good.

159
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,393
Miss, I had your dirty clothes
washed and ironed.

160
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,434
Thank you!

161
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,997
- Do you need fresh water?
- No, I'm almost done.

162
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,347
Who is it?

163
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,674
You're naked!

164
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,550
- I'll invite you to our new show.
- Thank you, Boss!

165
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,675
Take care, the path is slippery!

166
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,109
A Chinese pretending
to be a foreigner!

167
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,278
Miss, your umbrella!

168
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,119
Sir, what's your hurry?

169
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,232
Come up,
there are lots of girls here!

170
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,718
It takes so long.

171
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:07,830
A gunshot! What's the matter?

172
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,432
Who is it?

173
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,791
"Lam Chi Bo"

174
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,994
Master!

175
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,634
Master!

176
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,951
Master!

177
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,996
It's Wing. Open the door.

178
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,949
Master!

179
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,678
You opened the door just in time.
I nearly broke it down!

180
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,192
Have lunch with me sometime.

181
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,313
Excuse me!

182
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,193
- Kai, who's been shot?
- The greengrocer.

183
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,952
- Who shot him?
- I don't know. Ask Master.

184
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,791
Buck Teeth So, if I wasn't here,
you'd have broken that!

185
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,074
Por... ky... Porky...

186
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,231
My name's Wing. Call me Porky
again and I'll get mad.

187
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,959
Back so long and you still
can't speak Chinese.

188
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,988
- Por... ky...
- Bu... ck... Tee... th.

189
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,637
So, bring the medicine.

190
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,357
You can't handle the medicine!

191
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,192
What are you arguing about?

192
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,794
Master, I'm teaching him
how to be Chinese.

193
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,438
Give me The Magic Healer.

194
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,829
- The Magic Healer.
- 3, they're all 3 characters.

195
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,836
Master, you know I can't read!

196
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,354
And you laugh at those
who can't speak Chinese?

197
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,759
Come on, So.

198
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,193
Powder for Seven Cuts.
Blood-Clotting Powder.

199
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,634
So is from America.

200
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,276
He studied medicine there
and learns bone setting here.

201
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,153
Then he must be smart.

202
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,238
- Master, here's the water.
- Finally.

203
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,955
Take a rest, you'll be fine.

204
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,230
Master, this bullet
is from a shotgun.

205
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,469
Let's bandage him.

206
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,955
There are many ships, he can't tell
American and British flags apart.

207
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,508
He boarded the wrong ship
and got shot.

208
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,160
The country's being sold off
piece by piece.

209
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,355
When they argue, it's we who suffer.

210
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,874
We can't accept this kind of
treatment any more!

211
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,752
The Manchurians have taken our land.

212
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,070
Now they join the foreigners
and sell out our country!

213
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,878
Brothers of the Local Militia,
let's fight!

214
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,957
- Ca... ca... calm down!
- You're lecturing me?

215
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,388
Por... ky...

216
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,471
Watch your mouth! I'm your senior!

217
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,596
- Wing!
- Master!

218
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,913
You're too rash. Keep out of this.

219
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,757
This is a matter of life or death.

220
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,070
I must meet with the authorities
and the Westerners.

221
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,913
Otherwise how are we to survive?

222
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,679
- So, you explain to the captain.
- Yes!

223
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,549
How... come... your... English...
is... so... fluent?

224
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,872
Why so many daggers?

225
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,912
So, ask them to bring us
some dim sum.

226
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,596
Foon, your job
is to check tickets today.

227
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,275
I'm here to learn acting not check
tickets. It doesn't suit me.

228
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,035
It can't be helped. The others
have gone to America to mine gold.

229
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:28,078
America?! Gold mining?
Boss, is there really gold there?

230
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,199
Would I lie to you?
It's all in the newspaper.

231
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,874
I'd go too
if I didn't have to run this place.

232
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,388
Newspaper?! What newspaper?

233
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,278
They're here for protection money.

234
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,191
You haven't paid?

235
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,352
Yes I have,
but these thugs are from Shaho.

236
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,758
How dare they make trouble
so far from their turf?

237
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,273
If they mess with me, they've had it!

238
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,553
- What are you doing?
- I know you know some kung fu.

239
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,200
Didn't you say you
wanted to show off your stuff?

240
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,031
Here's your chance.

241
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,078
Boss, I'm not that good.

242
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,311
They've come to pay their respects
especially to you.

243
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,076
I'm being set up. Stop!

244
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,917
Boss, open the gate!
Boss, open up. Quick!

245
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,318
Oh, there's no daytime show.
No tickets left.

246
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,596
Thank you, Boss,
I'll come another time.

247
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,192
Hey kid, come on down!

248
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:26,309
I came all this way, and no show.
Next time I won't bother.

249
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,431
I know you're Foon.
You've got something to say?

250
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,557
- I'm just the ticket collector.
- We're the collectors here.

251
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,675
You must be quite a guy...

252
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,998
facing us all alone.

253
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,795
You've got guts!

254
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,872
You must be joking.
Let me buy you a gift.

255
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,432
No need.

256
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,795
No need for gifts,
just give me a hand.

257
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,153
Go on, chop it off.

258
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,038
Chop my hand off?
I'll chop your mother's head off!

259
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,034
Don't go!

260
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,594
Come on!
Me against all of you isn't fair!

261
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,596
Let's fight one on one another time!

262
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,875
Why not now?

263
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,190
Get him! Stop!

264
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,990
Someone's fighting in the theatre.
They're armed!

265
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,391
Stop! Stop! Get him!

266
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,875
Excuse me, excuse me!

267
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,551
- What's happening?
- A fight!

268
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,313
Fight outside,
we're doing business here. Out!

269
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,913
What is it, brother?

270
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,798
They want money,
and they want to fight me for it.

271
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,836
There are too many of them.

272
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,598
Kill that asshole!

273
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,835
- Sounds like trouble.
- Let's take a look.

274
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,032
That's Porky,
one of Wong's disciples.

275
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,159
Never met him.

276
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,192
Porky, out of respect for your master
I'll let you off.

277
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,517
- You're Master Wong's disciple?
- I am!

278
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,193
I saw this young doctor
at Lam Chi Bo.

279
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,679
That Chinese American.

280
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,034
- Foon!
- What?

281
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,351
I'm not kidding,
if you don't bring a hand to Shaho...

282
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,795
they'll be digging
your grave in Fatshan!

283
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,992
Let's go back to Shaho!

284
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,034
What? Turning chicken just
because Wong's disciple is here?

285
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,394
You want a hand?
This pig will donate one!

286
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,671
- Big brother, what shall we do?
- Do? Tear them apart!

287
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,392
Brother Wing. This one's for him!

288
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,038
He can have it for free.

289
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,828
You asshole!

290
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,351
Shaho's stupid, Shaho's dumb...

291
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,390
You want to mess with me?
I'll beat you to death.

292
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,548
Have some refreshments,
enjoy the show!

293
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,593
Take that! Hold it!

294
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,833
Add a little water,
make a perfect brew.

295
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,595
Who's throwing boiling water?
Find him! Go look up there!

296
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,989
Who threw the boiling water?
Out! Go!

297
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,114
You old bastard,
it must have been you!

298
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,356
- No it wasn't. I'm just eating.
- Really?

299
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,472
Wong Fei-Hung, this is General
Wickens of the British forces

300
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,868
and Mr Jackson
of the Sino Pacific Corporation.

301
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,269
They've kindly agreed
not to press charges.

302
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,192
So stop seeking damages
for the greengrocer.

303
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,555
This is unfair.
The people are outraged.

304
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,917
Outraged?!
Wong, you have no authority.

305
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,391
You are a mere civilian.
Who are you to negotiate?

306
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,471
This is a new age
of international cooperation.

307
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,439
It's better to keep the peace.

308
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,397
These rolls are made from our flour.

309
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,194
So you appreciate western food?

310
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,476
The foreigners draw boundaries here
and set up forbidden areas.

311
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,915
If we fight amongst ourselves
and keep bowing to them,

312
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,468
we'll lose more than flour.

313
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,913
I know you are friends with Lau,
Commander of the Black Flag Army.

314
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,674
He doesn't follow orders
from the Central Government.

315
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,590
I've been sent here to watch you.

316
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,273
I intend to set an example
here in Fatshan.

317
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,353
Are you all right?

318
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,551
Master, it's our Local Militia.

319
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,074
Master Wong!

320
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,555
Stop them!

321
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,112
Stop!

322
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,994
Don't fight!

323
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:55,798
Kai, I told you
to tell them not to fight!

324
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,637
He told you not to fight!

325
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,151
Put down your weapons!
You still want to fight?

326
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,835
Don't move.

327
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,477
- You're not bad!
- Of course!

328
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,037
Boss, that looks like Wong Fei-Hung.

329
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,519
Master Wong Fei-Hung.

330
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,909
He's outnumbered! Let's take him on!

331
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,077
Don't fight!

332
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,709
Don't fight!

333
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,673
Did he hit you? Don't fight!

334
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,348
Don't fight, Kai!

335
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,836
I told you not to fight!

336
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,676
I said don't fight!
You're still fighting?!

337
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,472
Are you sure?
They're coming. Let me go!

338
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,471
Boss, are you all right?

339
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,356
- Who kicked me?
- I don't know!

340
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,836
- Have you taken them on?
- Yes, we have!

341
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,954
Carry on!

342
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,873
- Buck Teeth So!
- Stupid!

343
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,628
So, tell them
it's all a misunderstanding.

344
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,318
No need to explain.

345
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,032
If China had no forbidden areas,
we'd all be in danger.

346
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,634
Master, this alien can speak Chinese.

347
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,712
You still want to fight?

348
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:10,878
Don't call me an alien, you devil!
Listen, we're here to do business.

349
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,672
Don't let this kind of crap
keep us from making big money

350
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,751
Otherwise you'll get yourself
in real trouble.

351
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,878
Goodbye, aliens!

352
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,599
Shoot on sight. Run! Run!

353
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,315
The authorities are here!
Let's get out of here!

354
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,592
Stop! Stay where you are!

355
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,672
Drop your weapons.
Why are the Local Militia fighting?

356
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,034
Where's Porky? Gone?

357
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,672
Don't move or we'll shoot.

358
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,559
Wong, this area's administered
by the foreigners,

359
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,471
yet the Local Militia
dare make trouble here!

360
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:00,518
You're their leader.
Explain yourself!

361
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,114
Excellency, as trained soldiers,

362
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,556
these men wouldn't act
without a good reason.

363
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,278
Soldiers? They're trash
the government discarded.

364
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,998
They're under our command now.

365
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,432
Excellency...

366
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,349
Tell them report to City Hall,
or get arrested!

367
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,394
Excellency!

368
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,675
Master Wong will pay
for all the damages.

369
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,398
Yes, Your Excellency!

370
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,713
Beware of fire!

371
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,838
Beware of thieves!

372
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,911
Master, I've lost my appetite.

373
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,467
All this trouble was started
by a gang from Shaho.

374
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,311
Now we have to report to City Hall.

375
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,231
Are they going to arrest us?

376
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,394
Master!

377
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,559
Sit down!

378
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,434
City Hall's authorised
to look into this.

379
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:09,398
If it's a set-up, they'll find out.
So, let's eat.

380
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,436
Until the verdict is known,

381
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,750
this'll be our last meal together.

382
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,188
Let's eat.

383
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,838
Attention, Militia men,
prepare to eat.

384
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,592
Pick up vegetables!

385
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,836
Eat rice!

386
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,797
Swallow!

387
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,028
13th Aunt!

388
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,512
Don't worry, your men will be fine.

389
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,195
It's late, why aren't you sleeping?

390
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,793
I want to take your measurements
for a suit.

391
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:30,552
A suit?
Why would I want a western suit?

392
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,596
It's for when you go abroad.

393
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,318
13th Aunt, is the West
really so wonderful?

394
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,710
What do we have to learn
from the foreigners?

395
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,389
They invented the steam engine
and many other things.

396
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,277
We must move with the times.

397
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,829
When we have time,
you must tell me more

398
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,876
about the world beyond China.

399
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,677
13th Aunt,

400
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,835
if the western world was so great,
why did you come back?

401
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,117
There are still some things here
they haven't got.

402
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,635
Such as?

403
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,759
People.

404
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,835
I missed some people very much.

405
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,791
I was abroad for two years,
but my heart was here.

406
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,753
You were always in my thoughts.

407
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,873
You are very kind.

408
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,512
- 13th Aunt!
- What's wrong?

409
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,670
I thought... No, it's nothing!

410
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,318
Fei-Hung, you and I
are relatives by name,

411
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,673
not by blood.

412
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,195
We were raised together,
don't call me 13th Aunt.

413
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,074
What else should I call you?
I'll do it.

414
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,668
- What's this? It doesn't matter!
- It doesn't matter?

415
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,751
Of course it does,
one must be precise.

416
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,708
Chinese shouldn't wear suits.

417
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,030
Chinese are Chinese,
Westerners Western.

418
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,313
There will be railways
and a telegraph company soon.

419
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,188
Everything will change.
China will change with the world.

420
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,871
You're right. Western guns
and ships are already here.

421
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,795
Everything is changing.
What will we change into? Who knows?

422
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,474
I appreciate your gift,
but you keep it.

423
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,750
When all Chinese wear suits,
I'll wear one.

424
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,956
Come greet the God of Fortune!
Here I am, the God of Fortune!

425
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,235
Get out of my way, you bloody priest!

426
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,353
Fortune?

427
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:43,753
Sir, we already bought
the God of Fortune.

428
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,831
Come greet the God of Fortune!

429
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,507
Sir, we already bought
the God of Fortune!

430
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,789
Did you buy protection from me,
or the other guy?

431
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,992
He's rotting in a ditch.
Want to see him?

432
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,478
Just buy a new one!

433
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,153
If I pay him, what happens
when the other guy comes?

434
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,753
- Sir, do you need help?
- You should join us!

435
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,389
- Life is tough right now!
- Give it all

436
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,958
so we can take care of you.

437
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,072
Sir, don't clean me out,
give me a break.

438
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,434
And who'll give me a break?
Hand it over!

439
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,195
Robbing your own people!

440
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,394
It's Master Wong!

441
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,869
You're from Shaho?
Come with me to City Hall.

442
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,153
Save me!

443
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,478
Stabbing your own people?

444
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,588
Get going! Run!

445
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:06,311
Quick! Run!
Where have you cowards run to?

446
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,193
Damn you!

447
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,668
It's too high!

448
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,909
All right! That's amazing!

449
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,797
Did you see the speed of that kick?

450
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,757
- Did you see it?
- No, it was too fast.

451
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,753
Listen to me. This man is a gangster.

452
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,114
I'm taking him to City Hall.
Please come and testify against him.

453
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,230
Incredible! What a jump!

454
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,034
Boss, he demanded protection money
from you.

455
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,914
- Come with me and be a witness.
- Me?

456
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,998
And fear for my life,
like the theatre boss does?

457
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,391
You two were practising kung fu
in there, I didn't see any fighting.

458
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:21,516
In America, people
have to walk carefully.

459
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,831
Because they might
trip on all the gold.

460
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,387
- Is that true?
- There's more!

461
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,755
If you wash your face in the river,
you'll find gold.

462
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,434
- Is it really that wonderful?
- Of course it is!

463
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,273
One visit to America is worth
a lifetime of work in China.

464
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,358
Come on, take a leaflet!
There's one for everyone.

465
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,556
People in America wear
dark glasses day and night.

466
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,117
It's so bright it hurts your eyes.

467
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,429
You can't pick up gold
if you're blind.

468
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,713
My poor lost sheep,
God's Kingdom belongs to you.

469
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,311
You're promoting America, too?

470
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,155
Material things are transient.
Only Jesus is the truth.

471
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,231
Come to Jesus. He forgives all sins.

472
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,710
I arrested a criminal today.
Will Jesus be my witness?

473
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:43,318
Beware of fire.

474
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,034
Beware of thieves.

475
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,438
Boss!

476
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:53,635
- Boss, are you over there?
- I'm here!

477
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,152
Get ready!

478
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,677
Master! How are you?

479
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,550
Are you crazy? Fans in this weather.

480
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,278
So, the Governor has locked up
the Local Militia?

481
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,431
He won't release them
till the suspects are caught.

482
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:25,793
Master!

483
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,039
I can't be a witness
because I'm a suspect.

484
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,038
They even let Hung of Shaho go.

485
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,355
When will our men be released?

486
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,596
When a witness comes forward.

487
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,077
Master, what about Foon?

488
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,432
- Foon?! Do you know him?
- Yes.

489
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:54,472
You must be mixed up in this.
What are you hiding?

490
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,992
I...

491
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,471
Master, you don't always trust me.
So, I...

492
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,594
What? Speak!

493
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:06,949
Mas... Mas... Master... The... There...

494
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:21,474
- Calm down, So. Don't panic!
- Master!

495
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,835
So!

496
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,030
Master, what shall we do?
Those arrows came from the roof.

497
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,074
I'm coming!

498
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,197
Never mind me.
Gather... the valuables!

499
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,719
Kai, get your weapon.
We'll take them on.

500
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:46,148
- Wing, put out the fire. I'm off.
- Alone?

501
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,034
Damn!

502
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,436
So! Here!

503
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:08,755
Goddamn steps!

504
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,911
His Excellency's fan?! Here it is!

505
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,032
Wow, the roof's like a furnace!

506
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,394
It's like hell down here!

507
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,670
Someone's on the roof. Shoot him!

508
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,398
It's Master Wong. Run!

509
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:04,518
Lam Chi Bo is on fire!

510
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,072
Lam Chi Bo will be lost forever.

511
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,914
- What are you doing?
- Taking a photo of Lam Chi Bo.

512
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,878
- You'll be burned alive!
- You're blocking the sign!

513
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,599
A little more, I can't see you.

514
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,398
Should we wait for Master?

515
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,994
The... roof... is... is on fire!

516
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,556
So, look this way!

517
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:43,315
Kai, shift a little to the right.

518
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:29,117
I thought I had it with me.

519
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:32,677
But I was taking pictures
of the clinic.

520
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:36,393
You're just like the foreigners!

521
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,117
Don't ever bring this
into the clinic again...

522
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,878
or I'll throw it away!

523
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,594
His Excellency the Governor is here!

524
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,478
Wong Fei-Hung, you open kung-fu
schools, triad societies...

525
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,108
divide up the town
and run illegal businesses.

526
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,110
Now other triads take revenge...

527
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:21,873
The burning of Lam Chi Bo
is your own fault.

528
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:24,434
It's time to mend your ways!

529
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,195
Excellency,
mine is not a triad society.

530
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,748
If the authority
labels martial arts illegal,

531
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,597
then our grand tradition
will be lost.

532
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,239
So when we are attacked,
how will we defend ourselves?

533
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,914
Is that what you call
preserving the peace?

534
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,309
You can't even save your clinic
and you dare lecture me!

535
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,914
It's your job
to investigate the fire.

536
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,956
You tell me, who did it?

537
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,514
I don't know.

538
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,954
You don't know?!
You're hiding something.

539
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:07,476
Wing!

540
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,909
- Wing, what are you doing?
- Master!

541
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,278
Can I come in?

542
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,028
Foreign devil...!

543
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,871
- Wing!
- Master!

544
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,358
Go on like this,
and you can stop calling me Master.

545
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,429
Don't go.

546
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:29,717
You must have a complaint
against Fei-Hung. You can tell me.

547
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:36,355
Wong Fei-Hung,
I know who set Lam Chi Bo on fire.

548
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,949
I can be your witness.

549
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,592
Check if anyone's from Shaho.

550
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,717
- Hey, are you from Shaho.
- No!

551
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,878
So many people!

552
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,474
Boss, looks like
the Governor's going to arrest you.

553
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,347
Goddamn!
That Jesuit must have squealed.

554
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,431
Shouldn't we go and hide back home?

555
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,994
Never! We're afraid of the Governor.
He's afraid of the foreigners.

556
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,389
So let's find some
influential foreigners!

557
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,387
Wait for me.

558
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,510
We want to speak to Mr Jackson.

559
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,951
Damn, we've no English. Try harder.

560
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:24,791
Please, please let us in
to see Mr Jackson.

561
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,235
We all want to see Mr Jackson.

562
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,273
If I keep a dog,
it'll guard my house.

563
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,876
You are wanted by the Governor.
What good are you to us?

564
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,996
I'm not afraid of being arrested.

565
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,710
But I am afraid that
without a leader,

566
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,233
my brothers' talents
will go to waste.

567
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,788
You came all this way
to make money,

568
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:01,594
by sending so many Chinese
to America.

569
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,835
Why don't I give you some women
to ship over?

570
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,313
No, we don't allow
the labourers to breed.

571
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,630
Otherwise they'd stay for good.

572
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,476
Not as wives as hookers.

573
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,311
As many as you want.

574
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,028
It's Wong who's the problem.

575
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,990
Dare you kill him for me?

576
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,989
- Master Wong?!
- Yes...

577
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:47,791
I'll invite him to the show tomorrow.
He won't get out alive.

578
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:40,628
Wing, the Governor is after
the Shaho Gang.

579
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:42,675
Foon, where have you been?

580
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,068
I have to go back to the theatre.
Come with me.

581
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:48,469
- Wait, let me lock up first.
- OK!

582
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:51,869
- Hey, come out first.
- Oh, right!

583
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,833
This is Wing.
He'll solve all your problems.

584
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:05,996
Master Wong's students. Welcome!

585
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,628
Don't worry. I'll check the tickets
for you. I like gate duty.

586
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,472
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

587
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,668
Tickets. Show me your tickets.
Stay in line.

588
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,074
Do you have tickets?

589
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:48,115
Tickets? Do you know who I am?

590
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:53,990
Look at the poster.
He's Wonder Ho, I'm White Gent.

591
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,309
And I'm Wing! No ticket? Go!

592
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,311
The show's starting
and you dare tell us to leave?

593
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,277
OK, we'll go, you'll regret this!
We'll go! We'll go!

594
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,838
Tickets...

595
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,635
Brother Wing, let's go in.

596
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:09,757
- No hurry, the actors aren't here.
- Thank you so much.

597
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,349
Have you seen Wonder Ho
and White Gent?

598
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,273
They tried to barge in,
I told them to piss off.

599
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,190
What? They're the actors!

600
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,278
Then we don't have a show.

601
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,476
You stay here,
I'll go and fetch them.

602
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:25,152
Tickets...

603
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,199
My Master's coming! I'm out of here!

604
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,152
Excuse me!

605
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,197
- So you accepted the invitation!
- Please!

606
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,436
- 13th Aunt!
- Master Wong!

607
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,668
Why so formal?

608
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,192
Relatives must respect
the rule of seniority.

609
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,557
OK, let's just watch the show!

610
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:06,833
Please!

611
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,708
Wing, we're in trouble.

612
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,916
Master's here. I don't want to stay.

613
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,356
The actors are gone.
You're going. What'll I do?

614
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,873
- I can sing.
- So what?

615
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,597
I can act a little. Let's go!

616
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,798
You dare sing on stage
in front of your Master?

617
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,429
Who's going to recognise us
with make up on?

618
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,159
OK, let's take a chance.
Come backstage.

619
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:39,753
Lucky you got us
or the show would be cancelled.

620
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,307
- I'm amazed you recognised me!
- Isn't that Wing?

621
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,833
Who's Wing? Let's go! Come on!

622
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,190
The White Snake is now a Fat Snake.

623
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,952
Porky! Porky!

624
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,550
Hey, Porky Wing's changed profession.

625
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,070
Where will we buy our pork
from now on?

626
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,469
Wing, again!

627
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,909
Nonsense!

628
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,230
I made him do it, don't blame him.

629
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,436
Pack up and never come back.

630
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,559
Brother Wing, I'll join you
in the pork business.

631
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,914
Watch out!

632
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:07,427
Get down!

633
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,474
Seal all exits!

634
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:18,389
- Lead the foreigners out.
- Yes, sir!

635
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,838
There's fighting outside.

636
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:27,797
Foon, it must be the Shaho Gang.
Go after them!

637
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,068
13th Aunt!

638
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,793
Stop it!

639
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,996
Don't shoot at the audience.

640
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,875
Don't shoot!

641
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:22,873
Son...

642
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,635
Limestone powder. Close your eyes.

643
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:53,389
Stay down!

644
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,195
It's not Wong? Forget him!

645
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,588
Protect His Excellency!

646
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,469
Come on.

647
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,434
Gun!

648
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,469
Take cover.

649
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,153
13th Aunt, take the gun
and protect the reverend.

650
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:43,273
They're here for me. Keep away!

651
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,273
Master, take the pole!

652
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,237
Master, I'll help you!

653
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,512
The floor's too thin.
