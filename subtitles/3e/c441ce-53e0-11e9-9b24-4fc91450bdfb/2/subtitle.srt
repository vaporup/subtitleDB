1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,183
- Master, I'll help you!
- Oh? And who are you?

2
00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:06,499
Protect 13th Aunt! I don't need help.

3
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,704
Leave her alone!

4
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,502
Reverend Father!

5
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:17,020
Wing, come and protect 13th Aunt.

6
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,021
They've gone backstage!

7
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:44,708
Let's see you fight up here!

8
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,623
Damn it!

9
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,105
- Why did you ambush me?
- It's you who ambushed me!

10
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,781
Foon? He's Foon?

11
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,383
It's dangerous here,
there are killers inside.

12
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,021
Question him!

13
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,389
- Foon, what're you doing?
- How would I know?

14
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,745
He's been hitting me
ever since he came in!

15
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,179
Don't move!

16
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,066
You say don't move,
but you still hit me!

17
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,628
Let's all stop this fighting!

18
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,268
Let's go!

19
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,826
Master Wong, don't move!

20
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,500
- Your Excellency.
- Silence!

21
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,501
Excellency, they left something.

22
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,269
"Glory to the Militia.
Death to foreigners"?

23
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,419
Weren't all the
Local Militia arrested?

24
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,905
How many have you sheltered?

25
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:59,538
Your Excellency. I'm being framed!

26
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,149
Don't listen to him!
Arrest these Shaho thugs!

27
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,140
What Shaho thugs?

28
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,227
That's the second time you've hit me.

29
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,504
Find out the truth
before you lay blame.

30
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,183
The truth?

31
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:18,384
- He's taking protection money!
- What? My Master?

32
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:19,698
Yes! That's him!

33
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:23,340
Master Wong? Isnâ€™t he from Shaho?

34
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,545
Where's Shaho? Near the Yellow River?

35
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,221
You don't need to explain.

36
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,987
My men will soon arrest
your other members.

37
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,384
But I'm going to arrest you first
and close your clinic.

38
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,268
Then let's see you make trouble!

39
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,669
Many people have been injured.
Let me help them, then I'll go with you.

40
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,858
All right, go ahead.

41
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:56,264
You'll be guarded. If anything
happens I'll execute you on the spot.

42
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:01,782
Don't move. You're bleeding.

43
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,425
- So, fetch the medicine.
- OK!

44
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,580
Go away. Can't you see
the eviction notice?

45
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,184
That doesn't give you permission
to steal our stuff. Give them back!

46
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,266
You dare to hit us?! Go away!

47
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,747
Don't you have anything better to do?

48
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,867
Master, they were stealing,
I stopped them.

49
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,823
So what? Do you want to fight?
I'll fight with you.

50
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,583
- OK, let's go!
- No! I mean I'll fight you!

51
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,947
- Master, how can I fight you?
- Where'd you like to be hit?

52
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,861
Is it here? Here?

53
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,148
You want me arrested right away?

54
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,663
If not, don't stop me
from saving lives.

55
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,739
Master!

56
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,707
Stop acting up!

57
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,548
We'll arrest you,
if you get in our way.

58
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,302
Porky's smart,
escaping arrest this way.

59
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,906
Hit me! Such restraint!

60
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:34,989
Mr Cheng!

61
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:38,744
Still bleeding.
Fetch me the coagulant!

62
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,545
Coagulant!

63
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,385
He's dead. Tell his family.

64
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,378
So...

65
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,864
Fei-Hung!

66
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,107
What's this tattoo?

67
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,864
It reads, "Jackson".

68
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,580
Is it his ship's name?

69
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,665
Don't be scared. I'm Wong Fei-Hung.

70
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,981
You're badly hurt.
If you move, you'll tear the wound.

71
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,905
You're Master Wong? Help me!

72
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,669
Get up. Where are you from?

73
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,267
- America!
- America?

74
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,947
We crossed seas and were
denied medicine when we were ill.

75
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,306
Many were thrown overboard.

76
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,465
In America,
we were branded like pigs.

77
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:25,668
We were cheated
by the Chinese dealers here.

78
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,824
We signed contracts,
paid for food and passage.

79
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,741
Paid for so many things.

80
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,741
Those who tried to escape
were killed.

81
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,985
I came back to China.
I... I... Master Wong...

82
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,420
Don't worry, you're home now.

83
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,423
Let me see
if we can find your family.

84
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,070
Try not to think too much.

85
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,987
Kai! Keep his contract
with the foreigners secret.

86
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,259
- Or the Governor will arrest him.
- I understand.

87
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,781
Going to America's better
than staying here.

88
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:18,987
Don't miss out! Come on...
Take a look! You want one?

89
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,898
- Go to America? How?
- Take one. You want one, too?

90
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,300
The same America as in the newspaper?

91
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,941
If you want to go, pay an exit tax,
passage, rental, blanket and food.

92
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,985
You can get a 3 year contract.

93
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,628
It costs 2 years' salary?!

94
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,347
- You haven't got any money?
- No.

95
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:40,659
Then don't even think about it!
Shove off!

96
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,947
You want one?
It's a land full of gold!

97
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,826
A fight's about to start over there!

98
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,423
A fight?
Let's go and watch it. Come on!

99
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:52,389
Don't go, don't go!

100
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:02,942
You dare show off in front of
my house and hit my disciple.

101
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,181
- What's your name?
- Master Yim.

102
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,778
I warn you.
My swordplay is unmatched.

103
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:40,465
You're a guest,
so I'll let you strike three times.

104
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,582
On guard!

105
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:05,578
Second strike!

106
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,547
Just two strikes
and you already draw your sword?

107
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,700
You're not my match.
Let's forget it!

108
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,023
Don't go!

109
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,865
You dare strike me from behind?

110
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,423
'Iron Robe kung fu'!

111
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,782
I've let you thrust 3 times.
Admit defeat!

112
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,985
There must be a way to beat him.

113
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:04,828
Why are you following me?

114
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,265
My name is Foon. I'm from May County.
There are lots of gangs in this town.

115
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,067
My kung fu is poor.
I'm often bullied.

116
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,745
I can't even make a living.

117
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,265
Please take me as your student.

118
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,384
What's the point of being a kung fu expert?
I can't make a living either.

119
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:44,628
Master, are you hungry?

120
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,544
You take shelter.
I'll think of something.

121
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:54,381
Give me a drumstick!

122
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,221
Good stuff, eh? We only eat the best!

123
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,428
Gentlemen, come inside!

124
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,187
The soup's salty. Don't drink it.

125
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:20,664
The soup's very salty today.

126
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,386
Hey, why'd you steal my bowl?

127
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:31,898
Gentlemen, welcome,
come in and have a drink.

128
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,423
Welcome gentlemen,
let me sing to you.

129
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,261
Master, have some soup.

130
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,861
2 men drinking from the same bowl.
Pathetic!

131
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,623
Madam, shall I have them thrown out?

132
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,261
If I made my name here,
no one would look down on me.

133
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,980
Right,
you have to become the top dog.

134
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:12,419
Who's the best in town?
Master Wong?

135
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,422
Fei-Hung!

136
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:01,062
13th Aunt, you're right.
China must change.

137
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,865
Fists can't fight guns.

138
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:09,303
I'm under house arrest,
soon I'll have to fight.

139
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:10,822
Take care of yourself!

140
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:15,620
- Fei-Hung, I'll wait for you.
- You don't have to.

141
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:20,303
If you do, I won't die in peace.

142
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,861
You won't die...

143
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,701
I'm just a man...

144
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,945
Go home.

145
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,304
Wing, he...

146
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,458
Wing, go inside, it's raining hard.

147
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,744
Master didn't tell me to come in yet.

148
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,228
Wing.

149
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,460
- Come back to Lam Chi Bo.
- Master!

150
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,027
Come on in!

151
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,618
I...

152
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:09,187
Master, let me!

153
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,468
So!

154
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,906
It's raining harder than ever.

155
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:12,186
It's closed! Push off!

156
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:26,747
I'm 'lron Robe' Yim from Shandong...

157
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:33,348
I'm here to challenge Master Wong.

158
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,303
Please tell me
which of you is Master Wong?

159
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:43,142
- Master, a challenger!
- Wing, bring some tea!

160
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:45,699
- Master!
- Bring tea!

161
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,338
Please!

162
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,861
Kai, take the patients to one side.

163
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,502
Have a seat!

164
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:03,897
Fold the umbrella.

165
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:12,543
Have some tea!

166
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,580
Foon, what're you doing?

167
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:18,422
Foon?

168
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:25,949
Master Wong,
your techniques are famous,

169
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:29,745
especially your 'Shadowless Kick'
and 'Ten Forms Fist'.

170
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:32,740
I intend to open
up my own school here,

171
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:35,024
that's why I'm here to challenge you.

172
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:39,387
Soon the people will know
my martial arts is the best.

173
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:43,098
I'm under house arrest,
you could get in trouble.

174
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,428
I can't fight you today.

175
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,060
Are you a warrior or not?

176
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:50,498
Master Yim!

177
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:56,861
I've patients here!
It's not the right place to fight!

178
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,223
Wing, Kai!

179
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,865
Do you want to be thrown out again?!

180
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:30,539
What are you waiting for?
Take the patients to the back.

181
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:34,018
I'll take you inside.
They're going to fight.

182
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,747
How dare you touch our patients?

183
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:37,865
Move him or he'll get hurt
by my master.

184
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:40,338
Bullshit! If not for my Master,
I'd beat you up.

185
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:43,022
- Let go!
- No!

186
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:46,821
- God damn it, Foon!
- What?

187
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:47,897
You dare try again?

188
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:07,776
Yim, stop fighting.

189
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,024
If you don't stop, I'll fire!

190
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:18,747
Don't hurt my Master. Give it to me!

191
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:32,781
Master, are you all right?

192
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:55,387
I've mastered the Iron Robe.
I don't fear guns.

193
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,909
Wong Fei-Hung, I won so easily,
it doesn't count.

194
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:00,468
Let's fight again tomorrow!

195
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:05,225
If you don't come,
I'll assume victory! Foon!

196
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:08,343
You jerk!

197
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:25,627
You ungrateful shit!

198
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:37,467
Speak Chinese, you banana!

199
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:47,904
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I just slipped!

200
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:51,467
The guards were injured,
there'll be trouble.

201
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:53,779
The Governor's men will be here soon.

202
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:56,781
Wing, Kai, go inside,
take some money and go.

203
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,701
13th Aunt,
go and wake the man from America.

204
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,776
What are you waiting for? Go!

205
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,663
Take him with you.

206
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:08,986
So, you don't know kung fu.

207
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:14,345
- Don't wait for them. Go!
- Mas...

208
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:18,062
- Take care!
- I'll see you off!

209
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:35,423
Don't act on impulse.

210
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:38,946
- Master.
- Be careful!

211
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,258
Don't worry, your word is my command.

212
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:44,018
Wing, tell 13th Aunt to leave.

213
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,226
I let them go in order
to get the whole gang. Search!

214
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:53,783
Wait! I have many patients here
and many invalids.

215
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,383
Please don't disturb them.

216
00:24:57,308 --> 00:25:01,097
You're asking me not to go inside?
There must be something hidden there!

217
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,464
My plan was to catch you off guard

218
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:08,065
and see who might be hiding
among your patients. Search!

219
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:09,218
Yes, sir!

220
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:14,748
Someone's getting away! After them!

221
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:18,624
Go!

222
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:22,781
So, go quick!

223
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,739
- Get them!
- Right!

224
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:29,141
Wing, fight!

225
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,578
What? Master?

226
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:36,426
Wing, I told you to fight!

227
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:39,901
- Manchurian Dog!
- You insult me?

228
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:41,464
Samson's Lift!

229
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,100
- Are we really allowed to fight?
- Yes!

230
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,457
Where's my gun?

231
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:15,616
Where are you going? Come back.
Shadowless Kick.

232
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,859
- After them!
- Yes!

233
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:27,182
Don't bother.
The man you want is here.

234
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:30,384
- Split up.
- Right!

235
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:34,664
This way.

236
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:37,467
Hold the pole, the rest go under.

237
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,948
Wong Fei-Hung,
I arrest you on charges of treason!

238
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,462
Your Excellency, I'll go with you.

239
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,696
- Kai!
- Master!

240
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:16,861
Kai, fetch medicine for the wounded.

241
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,861
Medicine from Lam Chi Bo
is the best.

242
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:22,988
How many of you are there?

243
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:27,180
- Are you all right, Your Excellency?
- You good-for-nothings!

244
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,580
We're almost there. Hang on!

245
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:34,981
Now we've got guns, we've got power.

246
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,503
We have to find women
for the foreigners.

247
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:39,707
Sha... Shaho Gang!

248
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,182
A woman!

249
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:51,776
Let go of So!

250
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:59,901
You get away!

251
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:02,656
Don't let her go!

252
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,382
Let go!

253
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:13,143
Sir, take care of yourself.
They are too many. Forget about me.

254
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:28,383
Go to hell!

255
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:30,538
Go!

256
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:33,741
- Let me go!
- Go!

257
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:42,466
There's one over there.
Get him! Get him!

258
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:47,106
Damn you, how dare you come to help?

259
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:55,579
Attacking the clinic?
Kicking Wong Fei-Hung?!

260
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,227
Challenging Master Wong!

261
00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:02,186
- We're not going home.
- Let's wait here!

262
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,589
When do you think
Master Wong will get here?

263
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:28,908
Open your mouth wide.

264
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:36,187
Open the door!

265
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:41,177
Go away!

266
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:50,787
You dare shoot me?
You'll be shipped out tonight!

267
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:54,339
Do you hate me?

268
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:56,897
Will your skin need spicing up?

269
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:04,418
When you have to serve
those stinking labourers,

270
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:07,022
you're gonna wish it was me.

271
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:09,785
- Take her to my room!
- Yes, sir!

272
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:13,223
Boss, the one who beat Wong is here.

273
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,668
Great!

274
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:18,859
Good, now Fatshan will be ours.

275
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:24,828
Master!

276
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:28,618
You know each other? Foon is now
your senior. You can trust him.

277
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,785
He's our senior?
Call him Big Brother.

278
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,667
Big Brother!

279
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:38,182
OK...

280
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:40,066
Remember he's senior.

281
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:43,664
Master, I'm busy tonight.
Please excuse me!

282
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:46,058
We'll talk about
the new school tomorrow.

283
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:49,178
Get the presents
for the Master ready.

284
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,984
Master Yim,
this is to help you open a school.

285
00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:00,700
The Yim's Fist Style
will soon dominate Fatshan.

286
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:03,018
Come... let's toast Master Yim!

287
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:06,067
Cheers, Master!

288
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:06,901
Don't move! What do you want?

289
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:12,546
Master Wong, we all admire you.

290
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:14,547
We know you've been set up.

291
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:18,104
Master Wong,
we've decided to free you...

292
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:20,624
and we'll take responsibility for it.

293
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:23,698
Master Wong, this way!

294
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:26,021
Great! Let's go, Master!

295
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,342
Master!

296
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:35,106
China is a land with laws.
I won't make a mockery of them.

297
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,703
- Go! Master!
- Go with them, Master!

298
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:42,378
No, Excellency.
I appreciate it, but I won't go.

299
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:44,857
Wong... Master Wong is over there.

300
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,705
Mas... Master!

301
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:50,745
Master, you're still here?

302
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:53,701
- So!
- Master... Mas... Mas...

303
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,222
Speak slowly.

304
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,301
Master, Aunt 13 and I took that man,
but we ran into the Shaho Gang.

305
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:01,379
They killed him
and captured 13th Aunt.

306
00:33:01,468 --> 00:33:03,619
- Think of a way to save her.
- What?

307
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,060
Master Wong, let's go and save her.

308
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:12,343
- Wing, I'll give you a few men.
- Good!

309
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,748
- Let them go!
- Right!

310
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:16,897
Buck teeth So,
how come you spoke so fast?

311
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:19,946
I was... rehearsing all the way.

312
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:37,301
Isn't that Master Wong?

313
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:44,427
Aren't they the Local Militia?

314
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,507
Master, you're great.
You even beat Wong Fei-Hung.

315
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,545
Give us a little demonstration.

316
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,500
Just a little!

317
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:11,621
Bitch! The hell with you!

318
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:00,905
That's enough, master, enough!

319
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,148
Master, that's enough!

320
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:12,465
What's wrong?

321
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,146
This money is dirty. Don't accept it.

322
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,346
What? Is he insulting us?

323
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:21,661
What do you mean?
You're looking down on us?

324
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,829
Nothing in this world is perfect...

325
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,701
Virtue is often found among
the lowly...

326
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:34,389
Our priority is to make our name
in Fatshan.

327
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:39,106
When that's achieved,
we can talk about justice.

328
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:44,621
That's life. Foon, pick up the money!

329
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:03,059
Pick up the money!
Pick up the money!

330
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,980
Pick up the money!

331
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:39,106
You think you're a big boss?
I think you're a nobody!

332
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,338
Foon!

333
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:44,980
Pick up the money!

334
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,027
Pick up the money!

335
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:00,541
Pick up the money!

336
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,306
Make our name in Fatshan?!
That's life!

337
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:34,458
Boss!

338
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,099
Bastard!

339
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:44,465
Damn you!

340
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:57,027
13th Aunt, wake up!

341
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:01,057
- Bastard, don't touch me!
- Don't scream, I've come to help.

342
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,018
Foon, is it you?
So many people are coming!

343
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,548
Get that woman!

344
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,228
Foon, stop or I'll kill her!

345
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,900
Our boss? Go to hell!
Hit me? Damn you!

346
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:58,465
Master, they are inside.
Let's go in!

347
00:39:58,548 --> 00:40:00,141
What's going on?

348
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,298
Master, Foon wasted no time!

349
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:05,621
He tried to force himself on my wife!

350
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:08,338
- No, it's not true...
- Shut up!

351
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,659
Foon, how dare you!
Apologise to your comrade!

352
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,630
Yim, we met at Lam Chi Bo.

353
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:22,740
Shut up, you bitch! Go!

354
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:26,025
You want to rebel?

355
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,307
Stupid! She's not his wife.

356
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:31,583
Really?

357
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,583
- She's related to Wong Fei-Hung.
- Wong Fei-Hung?

358
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,856
Foon is trying to escape!

359
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,777
Escape?!

360
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:12,057
How dare you.

361
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,268
Come back!

362
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:24,585
Get him!

363
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,505
- Take it easy!
- Yes, Big Brother!

364
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,148
- It hurts.
- Right!

365
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,539
Master,
these people have turned on me.

366
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,349
They'll do the same to you,
don't trust them.

367
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:47,467
You don't trust your comrades,
yet speak up for Wong?

368
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:51,148
How is it? Too tough for you?

369
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,949
Let him go.
I'll do anything you want.

370
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,782
What makes you want
to sacrifice yourself for him?

371
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:07,467
You dare try to bargain with me?
Are you really Master Wong's woman?

372
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:13,467
When I'm done with you,
your face will be so scarred,

373
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:15,744
even Master Wong won't recognise you.

374
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,099
Where's the woman
you took away today?

375
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,181
- Big Brother! Wong Fei-Hung is here!
- Master Wong?!

376
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,856
Arm yourselves!

377
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,427
Get all the guns out.

378
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,905
Go, get all the women on the ship.

379
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,626
Master, Wong is here.
You have to protect us!

380
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,143
Don't worry!

381
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,740
- Foon!
- Go!

382
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:47,219
13th Aunt!

383
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:48,708
Go!

384
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,027
Master Wong!

385
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:06,623
You're not needed here,
go search for 13th Aunt.

386
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,824
Yes.

387
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,061
Master Wong!

388
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,909
Master Yim, win or lose,
it's just a game.

389
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,585
You've got no excuse not to fight.

390
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:27,378
As you wish.

391
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,784
Down there!

392
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:29,737
"External Chi Kung"?

393
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:33,139
Today only one
of us leaves here alive.

394
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,989
Hey, how do you fire a gun?

395
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,708
Don't worry, we have guns.

396
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,740
You said you're good, come on.

397
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:55,182
I'll help you, Master.

398
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,943
Porky?!

399
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:12,141
Any more?

400
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:33,427
- Buck Teeth So!
- It's you?

401
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:36,786
Come up and get me down. Quickly!

402
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,949
13th Aunt has been kidnapped
by the Shaho Gang.

403
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:46,547
13th Aunt's been kidnapped
by the Shaho Gang, save her!

404
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,701
Hey, get me down,
Buck Teeth So!

405
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:57,583
Your Excellency.

406
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:42,143
Excellency, it's dangerous here.
You'd better leave.

407
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,981
Comrades, get inside!

408
00:48:55,509 --> 00:48:56,465
Boss, what now?

409
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:58,983
Kai, I'll help Master,
you save 13th Aunt.

410
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,425
No, I'll stay! You go!

411
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,420
I'm Big Brother! You listen to me!

412
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,543
Neither of you have to stay.
Go save 13th Aunt.

413
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:20,539
Go!

414
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,460
All's fair on the field of battle!

415
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:11,706
You call this Yim's Martial Arts?

416
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:15,507
The world's full of surprises.
One must take precautions.

417
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,378
Be quick, the ship's leaving.
Take them aboard!

418
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:23,025
Go, bitch!

419
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:26,385
Fei-Hung... it's 13th Aunt. Fei-Hung!

420
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:45,423
- Fei-Hung! It's 13th Aunt!
- Bring her to the ship, go.

421
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:57,467
Mr Jackson, Master Wong is here!
Master Wong, take him on!

422
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,864
The ship's over there!

423
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:03,827
Hung, take them to the cabin.

424
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:16,300
Get down, quick!

425
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,668
There... there!

426
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,268
Master Wong!

427
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,900
Master Yim, our match is over.

428
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,748
Master Wong, watch out!

429
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:32,826
Master Wong, where are you?
We haven't finished yet.

430
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:44,106
Master!

431
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:57,304
I am a master of the Iron Vest...

432
00:55:57,389 --> 00:55:58,344
Master Yim!

433
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:17,067
It's true. Our kung fu is
useless against the foreign guns.

434
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:31,338
You scum!

435
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:37,141
Master Wong, don't go!

436
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:41,943
Hold your fire!

437
00:59:00,389 --> 00:59:01,708
Foon!

438
00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:03,498
Kill him!

439
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,664
Watch out!

440
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,465
Master Wong, come on out
and fight man to man.

441
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:33,545
Fei-Hung,
he's got a gun in his knife.

442
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,427
- Don't fall into his trap!
- Shut up.

443
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:58,228
Bitch, you brought them here,
so I'll burn your face.

444
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:00,266
Let's see which is faster,
your fist or my gun.

445
01:00:05,509 --> 01:00:06,545
Burn!

446
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,307
Let me go!

447
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:43,588
- Mr Jackson.
- Sir.

448
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:47,221
Mr Jackson and the Shaho Gang
sold women to America.

449
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:49,621
Your Excellency, save us.

450
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:53,384
The Shaho Gang
and Jackson stole guns.

451
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,585
By law, you can't kill me,
you must hand me to the Government.

452
01:01:02,548 --> 01:01:05,780
- You've violated international law.
- Put down the gun!

453
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:08,668
Why won't it fire?
Did I forget to load it?

454
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,708
If you don't put it down,
I'll kill him!

455
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:13,983
Put down the gun!

456
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,621
You've offended a Chinese Official
in a forbidden area.

457
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,108
How will you explain that?

458
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,465
Don't let even one Chinese
leave alive.

459
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:41,385
Then I won't have to explain
anything to your Government!

460
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:51,427
You scum!
You don't have to explain!

461
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:08,704
- Your Excellency.
- You jumped from this height?

462
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:10,621
Child's play. No big deal.

463
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:15,030
Thank you, Your Excellency!

464
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,099
All credit to Master Wong.

465
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,862
- Don't mention it!
- Thanks, Master Wong!

466
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:38,021
China's changed so much.
How can I deal with it?

467
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:42,141
America?
Do they really have gold there?

468
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:47,820
If they really did have so much gold,
why would they come here?

469
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:51,304
Maybe we're standing on gold now.

470
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:22,548
After this ceremony,
you'll be my Master.

471
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:25,548
But 13th Aunt
and I are so close now...

472
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,905
We'll be together
from morning to night.

473
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:32,302
If one day she marries me,
then you'll have to call me Uncle.

474
01:03:32,389 --> 01:03:36,985
I'll be your senior
so you'll have to serve me.

475
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:40,106
Foon, what are you thinking?

476
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:42,742
Have some tea, Master!
