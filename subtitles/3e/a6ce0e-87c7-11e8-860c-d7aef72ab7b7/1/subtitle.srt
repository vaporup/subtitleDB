1
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,335
Man: Balance metric pressure at 057.

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,630
Man 2: Metric pressure
sustaining 057.

3
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,965
Releasing valves.

4
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,677
Man 1: Prepare to load M.R.D.

5
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,348
Man 2: Radioactivity meters online,
ready for exposure.

6
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,721
Man: Docking hatch open and clear.

7
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,060
M.R.D. removed from containment.

8
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,394
Preparing to load.

9
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,689
Hold full exposure duration
at no more than ten seconds.

10
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,359
Nine, eight...

11
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,569
seven, six...

12
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,947
five, four...

13
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,032
three, two...

14
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,575
one.

15
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,496
M.R.D. in place.

16
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,623
<i>Close hatch.</i>

17
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,459
<i>Turn handle left 45 degrees.</i>

18
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,171
<i>Lock it at high noon
to engage sequence.</i>

19
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,143
Left 45, then right.

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Left... right.

21
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,897
You just caused
a thermonuclear explosion,

22
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,816
wiped out the whole city.

23
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,569
Sorry, Jim.

24
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,571
I promise I'll get it right
on the day.

25
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,447
Jim: This is the day, Matty.

26
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,783
You want us to switch?

27
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,869
No, there's no time for him
to learn the meters.

28
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,829
I'll never understand
how you're able to solve

29
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,747
the most complex
mathematical equations,

30
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,125
but you can't tell
left from right.

31
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,585
It's a form of dyscalculia.

32
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,171
The parietal lobes
of my cerebral cortex--

33
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,589
Jim: Okay.

34
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,216
We have time for one more practice
run at this. Reset everything.

35
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,052
We've been at this
for 72 hours straight.

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,388
Only two more till we go live.

37
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,931
I'll get you some more coffee.

38
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,767
Coffee, amphetamines,
more coffee.

39
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,144
You're gonna kill yourself.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,564
We are precious moments
from a topological anomaly.

41
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,774
Is that what I should tell
everyone at your funeral?

42
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,067
No.

43
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,028
You signed
a confidentiality agreement.

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,246
Jim Beale, project log.

45
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,373
Part one of the experiment.

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,791
Tentative results.

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,128
Opening a traversable wormhole
in the space-time continuum,

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,130
first ever recorded.

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,636
This tear that I will create
in the fabric of the universe

50
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,304
is powered by M.R.D.

51
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,725
Extremely volatile,
radioactive substance,

52
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,894
so, of course,
all precautions will be taken.

53
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,649
Possible dangers range
from manageable radiation leak to...

54
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,569
well, the universe
collapsing onto itself.

55
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,990
It's now 47 minutes until we initiate
the first part of the sequence...

56
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,201
opening one end of the wormhole.

57
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,579
Okay. He should be here.

58
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,456
I'm gonna give him
the Big Bang speech.

59
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,876
Oh, Jim, give him the fireworks.
That's what he's here for.

60
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,962
Now, once opened, we should detect

61
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,923
a unique sequence
of particles sent through

62
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,509
from the other side,
a sequence so unique

63
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,345
that we will know that we
sent them to ourselves.

64
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,142
<i>And I will have
proof of the findings</i>

65
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,728
<i>to show our venture capitalist,
Klaus Meisner.</i>

66
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,400
<i>And he will then provide
the necessary M.R.D.</i>

67
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,068
<i>for us to open the other end.</i>

68
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,404
Let's see what I'm paying for.

69
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,115
Then we will send this unique
sequence of particles

70
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,491
back through to ourselves,

71
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,577
thereby proving that the project
is a success.

72
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,044
The Big Bang.
We have proven theories...

73
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,088
This isn't my ideal situation.

74
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,843
To have an investor be this kind
of major factor in an experiment.

75
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,929
<i>But I only have enough M.R.D.
to open one end.</i>

76
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,598
We are about to embark on a journey

77
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,560
- that's going to take--
- Enough of the physics lesson.

78
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,687
Get on with the light show.

79
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,231
This whole thing is
an experiment in certainty.

80
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,528
I'm certain it will work.

81
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,084
Jim: Balance metric pressure at 057.

82
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,796
Matty: Metric pressure
sustaining 057.

83
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,048
Releasing valves.

84
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,302
Docking hatch open and clear.

85
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,471
Jim: Prepare to load M.R.D.

86
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,730
M.R.D. removed from containment.

87
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,649
Hold full exposure no longer
than ten seconds.

88
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,737
Nine, eight...

89
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,156
seven, six...

90
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,117
five, four...

91
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,828
three, two...

92
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,206
one.

93
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,209
M.R.D. in place.

94
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,127
Close hatch.

95
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,800
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

96
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,390
Lock it at high noon.

97
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,894
Engage sequence.

98
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,858
Here we go.

99
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,758
Man: <i>Jim. Jim.</i>

100
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,139
We thought you were having a seizure.

101
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,767
- Did it work?
- Kept you from biting your tongue.

102
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,395
- No, the machine.
- The magnetic core melted.

103
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,106
- The regulator's blown.
- Where's Klaus?

104
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,900
He left when you were unconscious.

105
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,069
You can only burn a candle
at both ends for so long.

106
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,988
You should go home
and get some sleep.

107
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,865
I sold my home to pay you and Matty.

108
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,827
Maybe it was sabotage.

109
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,871
- Right.
- No, I'm serious.

110
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,415
Maybe it was visitors from the future

111
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,917
who came back to destroy our project

112
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,586
because it eventually leads
to some distant apocalypse.

113
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,547
It's a distinct possibility.

114
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,425
Guys.

115
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,471
Look what I found.

116
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,532
It's an exotic hybrid
of the dahlia genus.

117
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,994
There. Right there. That black speck.

118
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,789
Could be a missing pixel.

119
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,041
- It's moving.
- Yeah. There it goes.

120
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,544
Jim: There.

121
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,005
- I think that was Matty.
- No, no, I saw someone.

122
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,924
I saw it before I blacked out.

123
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,759
It looked like a person. Not Matty.

124
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,056
They went out the front.

125
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,625
Where did you just come from?

126
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,546
I should be asking you.
How did you do that?

127
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,964
- What?
- That.

128
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,465
How did you get here?

129
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,426
In a car. How did you get here?

130
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,303
You didn't just walk
through a wormhole?

131
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,971
You're making me feel like I did.

132
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,599
I just met you.

133
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,435
Then why are you acting
like you know me?

134
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,230
I don't.

135
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,791
You left before you could see.

136
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,044
It was a success.

137
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,879
Didn't appear
that way to me, Mr. Beale.

138
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,380
If you just come back
into the lab.

139
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,675
You've wasted my money.
Now you're wasting my time.

140
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,927
I can prove to you that it worked.

141
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,639
Look, I'm already late
for a previous engagement.

142
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,433
We made history tonight. I'm sure
whoever it is will understand.

143
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,101
"Whoever it is" is my wife.

144
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,353
She's already at the restaurant,

145
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,523
and I assure you,
she will not understand.

146
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,696
Why don't you
and your little friend join us

147
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,573
and we can discuss this over dinner?

148
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,367
We just met.

149
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,702
- Another time, then.
- No. no, no, no.

150
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,413
We would love to join you and your
wife for dinner, wouldn't we?

151
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,082
- Abby.
- Abby.

152
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,792
Abby.

153
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,420
What's going on, Jim?

154
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,422
Start running preliminary tests
on the flower.

155
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,549
I'm gonna go to dinner
with the Meisners and Abby.

156
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,718
Okay.

157
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,763
Who's Abby?

158
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,383
Jim: What we've done is folded

159
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,761
on top of itself
by forming a tunnel, a shortcut

160
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,265
between one location in space-time
to another light-years away.

161
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,143
But in order to traverse a wormhole,
you have to have two openings.

162
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,354
What we did tonight
was open one end of it.

163
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,772
Where's the other end?

164
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,066
We have to do it again to find out.

165
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,568
I'm not sure I follow.

166
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,570
The way it works is,

167
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,697
you need a transmitter
and a receiver.

168
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,116
Now, like a telephone...
I'm mixing metaphors here,

169
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,827
but you can't complete a call
without another phone involved.

170
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,787
We already have the receiver.

171
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,581
We got the call.

172
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,917
How much?

173
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,961
It's not capital I'm asking for.

174
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,671
No, for the whole project.

175
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,091
The research, the formulas,
the machine, everything. How much?

176
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,301
It's not for sale.

177
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,511
Then what do you want, Mr. Beale?

178
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,598
- Another unit of M.R.D.
- And for that I get what, 10%?

179
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,683
We're talking about
dangerous radioisotopes,

180
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,351
enriched uranium, yellowcake,

181
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,520
the sort of thing
countries go to war over.

182
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,731
Not anymore, once we have the ability

183
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,983
to answer the fundamental
questions of the universe.

184
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,611
But how will we make money
on our investment?

185
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,947
With all due respect,

186
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,075
we're not talking about
hover cars and x-ray goggles.

187
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,454
We're talking about an epoch
of human evolution.

188
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,998
Pardon my pedestrian
viewpoint, Mr. Beale,

189
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,959
but how do you plan to market that?

190
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,922
Pardon my pedestrian viewpoint
for a moment, Ms. Meisner.

191
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,673
Do you know
who pioneered electricity?

192
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,635
Of course.

193
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,428
Thomas Edison.

194
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,473
I thought so, too.

195
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,476
Until I stumbled upon a book
about Nikola Tesla.

196
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,482
You see, Tesla was working
towards a way

197
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,901
to get everyone
on the planet safe, free,

198
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,071
limitless electricity,
and he would have,

199
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,365
except Edison did everything
in his power

200
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,700
to discredit him
and crush his reputation.

201
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,118
Mm.

202
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,788
Edison's company developed a patent

203
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,290
for an inefficient current
you had to pay for.

204
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,960
Tesla wanted to better the world.

205
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,963
And Edison forced us all
to have a monthly power bill

206
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,423
because he was envious
of a profound idea.

207
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,011
Now, I don't have a horse
in this race,

208
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,681
but I would put my money on Jim,

209
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:11,726
because he's Tesla,
and Edison was a dick.

210
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,784
I'll supply you with the M.R.D.

211
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,829
But I want to own half the machine.

212
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,165
Can't do that.

213
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,587
Well, you see, my company
is in the enviable position

214
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,131
of being the sole
manufacturer of M.R.D.

215
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,260
So, best of luck.

216
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,097
Forty-nine percent.

217
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,600
And money for the repairs.

218
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,690
You have a week.

219
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,401
I won't sleep till it's complete.

220
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,537
Thank you.

221
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,998
Thank you.

222
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,184
You want to share a cab?

223
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,784
Jim: Was I playing the beard tonight?

224
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,664
Why do you ask?

225
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,540
Well, either you came
to the lab with Klaus

226
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,376
or you got there
through the wormhole.

227
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,713
I did arrive with Klaus.

228
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,716
But I'm leaving with you.

229
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,306
That kiss could've cost me
millions of dollars.

230
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,935
Would it have been worth it?

231
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,694
I'd have to do more research,
eliminate the variables.

232
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,987
Mm.

233
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,422
This is me.

234
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,844
You sure he won't mind?

235
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,262
He went home...

236
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,139
with his wife.

237
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,906
Drinks?

238
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,535
Black coffee for me.

239
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,382
KMC 0-14.

240
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,093
You like my dahlia?

241
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,765
Yeah. Where did you get it?

242
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,453
Sorry. I have to take this.

243
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,415
Chuck, what do you got?

244
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,042
<i>What are you doing?</i>

245
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,502
Uh, talking to you.

246
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,755
<i>What time do you have
exactly to the second?</i>

247
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,759
9:45:22, 23.

248
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,052
Come on, get on with it.

249
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,762
<i>When did you and I first meet?</i>

250
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,765
- What is this?
<i>- Just tell me. It's important.</i>

251
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:23,311
Uh, ten years ago at that karaoke bar
with the weird name. What's going on?

252
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,688
<i>So, we've known each other
a long time.</i>

253
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,482
<i>- We trust each other?</i>
- Yeah.

254
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,901
<i>Stay away from that girl.
She's no good for you.</i>

255
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,111
What?

256
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,532
<i>Just don't tell her
or anyone else about the experiment.</i>

257
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,910
<i>We're onto something
much bigger than we imagined.</i>

258
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,676
What are you doing here, Jim?

259
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,303
I went to the lab.
You guys were gone.

260
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,805
You should go back.
We'll meet you there.

261
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,558
No, no, no, you called. You said
something... We were onto something.

262
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,893
And what was this stuff about Abby?

263
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,319
My head is killing me.

264
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,654
See?

265
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,991
I told you, you need to stop popping
those pills and get some sleep.

266
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,328
What did you mean earlier
when you were talking about Abby?

267
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,038
Let me get you some pills.

268
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:10,084
Chuck. Chuck, I figured it out.
It makes sense.

269
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,669
I finally see it now.

270
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,588
Fucking intense.

271
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,470
Matty, stop.
You're giving Jim a headache.

272
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,389
This isn't a headache. This is
a lightning storm between my temples.

273
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,141
Just tell me,
what did you mean earlier

274
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,976
when you were talking about...

275
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:09,560
How long was I out?

276
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,313
Huh? Oh, Jim, you're awake.

277
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,359
Um, you were unconscious
for approximately 8.5 hours.

278
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,819
Why didn't you wake me?

279
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,072
Your biological imperative requires
a minimum amount of dormancy per day

280
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,865
in order to properly function.

281
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,827
But you should lie back down
in case of another--

282
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,495
I just needed some sleep.
I got plenty.

283
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,539
Where'd you get that jacket?

284
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,125
Haven't you considered
the correlation

285
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,712
between your episodes
and the arrival of KMC 0-14?

286
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,213
KMC 0...

287
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,215
The serial number of the dahlia.

288
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,179
We have to wait for Chuck
to get back.

289
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,099
You and Chuck meet me at the lab.

290
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,268
We have another wormhole to open.

291
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,647
We have to wait for Chuck.

292
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,755
Man: <i>Hey, did you forget your keys?</i>

293
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,882
Is this the residence of Abby Ross?

294
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,383
<i>She's not here.</i>

295
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,553
This is Jim Beale.
I'm a friend of hers.

296
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,847
Hey, sleepyhead, looking for me?

297
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
Is there a man in your place?

298
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,316
I guess you buzzed
my neighbor by accident.

299
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,777
I need to see your flower.

300
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,988
Wow, classy. I am a lady.

301
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,825
You can at least buy me
breakfast first.

302
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,301
Do they even serve breakfast here?

303
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,887
Two morning specials, Mike.

304
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,308
Your dahlia, where did you get it?

305
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,852
It was a gift.

306
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,608
Exotic plants like that are hard to
come by. It's an expensive present.

307
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,030
Ahh.

308
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,372
It was from someone who
gave me everything I wanted

309
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,124
except a minute of his time.

310
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,001
Well, time is our only real currency.

311
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,087
Hm.

312
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,389
Meeting you was the most
important part of my experiment.

313
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,016
Is that a fact?

314
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,726
Hm. No, it's not a fact.

315
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,146
I, uh, only meant to say
that your dahlia,

316
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,022
that may be important to my research.

317
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,566
Mm-hmm.

318
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,942
Hit me again, Mike.

319
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,696
Or maybe not, I don't know.
Right now it's just a theory.

320
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,130
So, what's all this fuss
about my dahlia?

321
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,883
How do I know I can really trust you?

322
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,553
The truth will set you free.

323
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,770
The ID number matches the one
that came through the wormhole.

324
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,150
But that's probably
just a coincidence.

325
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,569
You people don't believe
in coincidences.

326
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,405
Sure we do. Yeah.

327
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:53,659
Einstein himself said that they're
God's way of remaining anonymous.

328
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,208
So, your machine working
was total happenstance.

329
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,460
No. No, that was me. I did it.

330
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,338
I'm the one that came up
with the idea that made it work.

331
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,256
And what was that?

332
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,302
The rotation of the Earth.

333
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,888
The biggest obstacle
in opening a wormhole

334
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,264
is creating enough energy.

335
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,100
Not unlike
the tremendous amount of energy

336
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,103
that an entire planet makes
as it spins on its axis.

337
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,147
The power is there.

338
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,816
I didn't have to generate it.

339
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,277
I just thought of a way
to utilize it.

340
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,948
Kind of like us.

341
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,492
I mean, the energy's there.

342
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,578
We just got to think
of a way to use it.

343
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,527
Jim?

344
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:52,987
Are you okay?

345
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,238
Chuck.

346
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,240
You found me.

347
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,159
Technology's come a long way.

348
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,660
Not being found is hard.

349
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,039
I think we sent this to ourselves.

350
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,972
Chuck...

351
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,600
you were right about the girl.

352
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,313
Jim:...five, four...

353
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,358
three, two...

354
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,027
Chuck: Jim. Jim, Jim.

355
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,614
The pressure dropped below 029.
We have to abort.

356
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,368
All right, abort.
It's that damn bracket again.

357
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,370
We're gonna have
to reconfigure the output.

358
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,497
It might take a while to recalibrate.

359
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,457
Chuck: Why don't you take a break?

360
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,590
- Jim: <i>I like your lighter.
- Take it, it's yours.</i>

361
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,761
Needs fuel. Hand me those matches.

362
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,600
So, my flower's really the same one
that came through your wormhole?

363
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,646
I'd have to run some tests
to know for sure.

364
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,483
What's my finder's fee?

365
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,112
What?

366
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,781
Abby: <i>Okay, fine.</i>

367
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,784
<i>I'll settle for one butterfly kiss.</i>

368
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,972
It's a match, Jim.

369
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,391
Identical DNA match.

370
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,730
KMC 0-14, you're the first
organism to time-travel.

371
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,315
Yes, but in
a parallel-universe scenario,

372
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,068
we have to consider
that the Klaus Meisner Corporation

373
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,279
- may not have--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

374
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,282
- What did you just say?
- Parallel universe?

375
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,992
- We have to--
- No, no.

376
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,162
Klaus Meisner Corporation.

377
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,707
KMC 0-14.
Klaus Meisner Corporation 0-14.

378
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,251
They license exotic plants
and flowers for domestic use.

379
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,170
We have to take into account

380
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,255
the very distinct possibility

381
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,466
that these two plants
when they traversed--

382
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:19,717
Jim Beale.

383
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,552
Man: <i>I have Klaus Meisner for you.</i>

384
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,012
Yeah, put him through.

385
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,806
Klaus: <i>Mr. Beale, you have
the dahlia in your possession.</i>

386
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,934
Yes. Did she tell you that?

387
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,896
<i>I want you in my office
to go over the contracts.</i>

388
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,355
What's going on here?

389
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,940
<i>You're about to get fucked.</i>

390
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,598
Klaus: <i>Logic.</i>

391
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,560
<i>Rationale. Dignity.</i>

392
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,022
<i>All seem to disappear
with the scent of that perfume.</i>

393
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,360
<i>Good reason, common sense,
they just go by the wayside</i>

394
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,779
<i>'cause of the way her hair
breaks across her forehead</i>

395
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,280
<i>and frames her eyes.</i>

396
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,366
<i>The total reckless abandon</i>

397
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:29,036
that you have absolutely
no control over, Mr. Beale.

398
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,121
Have a seat.

399
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,499
I prefer to stand
when I'm getting it from behind.

400
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,125
You watch your tone.

401
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,586
If you're gonna come at me,
you better come hard and fast

402
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,089
and be willing to go all the way,
because I never lose.

403
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,299
Klaus, listen.

404
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,260
You call me Mr. Meisner.

405
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,930
My best friends and associates call
me Klaus, but you, sir, are neither.

406
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,890
You are an employee.

407
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,809
I don't work for you.

408
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,605
The hard cost of one unit of M.R.D.

409
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,691
is five million,
give or take a little.

410
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:03,654
What for you is a small fortune
is for me negligible.

411
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,825
I've lost larger sums
in the cushions of my sofa.

412
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:12,621
But you need M.R.D.
for your machine to work.

413
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,208
Therefore you come to me,
hat in hand, begging.

414
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,254
Forty-nine percent of my project
hardly makes you my boss.

415
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,424
This is true, but you need tangible
proof that your prototype works,

416
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:26,552
evidence that you've actually
created a traversable wormhole.

417
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,971
And to do that, you need to be able

418
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:33,392
to send the original specimen,
which is registered as KMC 0-14,

419
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,019
back through to the other side.

420
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,479
Now...

421
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,985
It just so happens
that I own all copyrights,

422
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:46,030
commercial and private,
for all KMC products,

423
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,489
which means...

424
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,576
this is your lucky day.

425
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,996
I'm willing to sell
to you those rights

426
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:58,083
for let's say, 50% of your operation.

427
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,962
Now, if you put that together
with the 49% I already own...

428
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,466
Let's crunch the numbers,
that leaves you with...

429
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,344
one percent for your efforts.

430
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,181
Now, if you want to
finish this experiment

431
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,850
that leads to the invention
of time travel,

432
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,810
then you, Mr. Beale, work for me.

433
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,938
You are an employee.

434
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,525
So, you slipped up.

435
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,653
Had a moment of weakness.

436
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,615
I have to admit,
she's an incredible piece of ass.

437
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,660
But you and I both know
you're not gonna walk away

438
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,078
from the find of the century

439
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,789
because of whose name's gonna
end up in the textbooks.

440
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,750
Like our little friend
said, you're Tesla,

441
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:43,629
and I'm quite content being just
another Edison of the world.

442
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,326
Jim Beale.

443
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,080
Project log, final entry
before zero hour of the experiment.

444
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,544
A piercing sound has been cutting
through every synapse of my brain

445
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,629
ever since I opened
the first end of the wormhole.

446
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,548
It's finally ceased.

447
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:29,842
Hopefully for good.

448
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,179
Klaus Meisner has me on the ropes.

449
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,558
<i>He knew that I needed
a correlative between side "a"</i>

450
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,768
<i>and side "b" to prove
that the machine works.</i>

451
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,354
Otherwise, it's just a bunch
of blinking lights.

452
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:46,442
<i>I mean, if I send the dahlia back
to myself, then he owns my machine.</i>

453
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,860
Wait, what are you doing?

454
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,695
I'm taking it back
to its rightful owner.

455
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,406
The one variable in this is Abby.

456
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,535
<i>And I need her to be a constant.</i>

457
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,164
<i>So if the fate of my machine
is predetermined,</i>

458
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,833
<i>it has to be because of her
that the dahlia goes through.</i>

459
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,753
She has to be the one to put it
through the wormhole.

460
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,842
<i>If she brings it to the lab,
if she comes there with Klaus...</i>

461
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:16,346
that is very fucking unfortunate,

462
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,599
but at least I will know.

463
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,705
Jim.

464
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,459
- I really wasn't expecting you.
- You don't have to invite me in.

465
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,712
Good. It's a bit of a mess
in there at the moment.

466
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,923
The gun is to my head.

467
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,593
But I'm sure as shit
not gonna pull the trigger myself.

468
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,720
This is yours.

469
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,723
You get to decide what happens.

470
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,520
In two days, I'm gonna
start the machine,

471
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,230
and I'll open the wormhole.

472
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,900
But now it's up to you
what goes through it.

473
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,488
You have to make the choice.

474
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,836
Mr. Meisner, would you be
so kind as to wait here

475
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,589
while I escort Ms. Ross
and her dahlia

476
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,090
to the lab floor?

477
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,393
So, this is the way it's gonna be?

478
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,813
It's the way it has to be.

479
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,148
The way it is.

480
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,775
It only seems that way now,

481
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,403
but eventually you will see it
in a different light.

482
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,242
We had our time together.

483
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,462
Goodbye, Jim.

484
00:36:58,592 --> 00:36:59,801
Put these on.

485
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,305
Wouldn't want you to miss a thing.

486
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,320
Five, four...

487
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,114
three, two...

488
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:22,908
one.

489
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,826
Matty: M.R.D. in place.

490
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,536
Jim: Close hatch.

491
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,624
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

492
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,047
Lock it at high noon.

493
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,509
Engage sequence.

494
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:58,110
Commence graviton resonance.

495
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,244
You may own the dahlia,
but you don't own me.

496
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,192
Do you have a light?

497
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,195
Matches?

498
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:06,696
Two sticks I can rub together?

499
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,031
Yeah.

500
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:17,582
Recognize that?

501
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,917
Should I?

502
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,377
It's yours.

503
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,754
It is now. Thanks.

504
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,635
What you and Klaus are doing
is wrong, and it has to stop.

505
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:30,720
- Excuse me?
- I know what you're up to,

506
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,305
and I'm not gonna
let it happen again.

507
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,892
That's none of your business.

508
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,520
It'll be my business if you
and I get involved.

509
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,190
Does this technique
usually work for you?

510
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,443
Or have you been cooped up
in the lab too long,

511
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,862
- you've forgotten how to flirt?
- Listen, I'm onto you.

512
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,990
I should have known that someone
as intelligent and as beautiful

513
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:53,326
as you are, I should have known
there had to be some kind of catch.

514
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,081
There is a catch. It's a big one.

515
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,309
Where did you just come from?

516
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,062
I should be asking you.
How did you do that?

517
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,981
- What?
- That.

518
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,942
How did you get here? You didn't
just walk through a wormhole?

519
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,111
You're making me feel like I did.

520
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:30,614
I just met you.

521
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,449
Then why are you
acting like you know me?

522
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,994
I don't.

523
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,445
- Tell me, Matty, again where it was.
- It was exactly right here.

524
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,239
You and I both almost stepped on it.

525
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:15,367
I didn't. I didn't see it when
I came in. I would've seen it, Matty.

526
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,495
When I was on the stairs, I came
here, and I almost tripped on it.

527
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:22,123
Jim? I thought you were
at dinner with Klaus.

528
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,125
I am.

529
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:27,879
Let's try this.

530
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:30,757
That's my phone.

531
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,133
Now, call it with yours.

532
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,646
It went to voicemail.

533
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,815
Right. Try it again.

534
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,862
It's ringing.

535
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,116
Jim: <i>Chuck, what do you got?</i>

536
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,786
- What are you doing?
<i>- Uh, talking to you.</i>

537
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,872
What time do you have
exactly to the second?

538
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,086
<i>What? 9:45:22, 23.
Come on, get on with it.</i>

539
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,379
It could be an imposter.

540
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,548
Ask him something
only you and I know.

541
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,884
Uh, when did you and I first meet?

542
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,303
<i>What is this?</i>

543
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,013
Just tell me. It's important.

544
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,098
<i>Uh, ten years ago at that karaoke bar</i>

545
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,808
<i>with the weird name.
What's going on?</i>

546
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,102
Ten years ago at the karaoke
bar with the weird name?

547
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,312
I didn't know that.

548
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,063
<i>Chuck, you there?</i>

549
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,774
Now, tell me not to trust Abby Ross.
She's just using me.

550
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,194
What? No.

551
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,989
You're my best friend.
I will understand.

552
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,287
So, we've been friends a long time.

553
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,873
- We trust each other?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

554
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,252
Stay away from that girl.
She's no good for you.

555
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,129
<i>What?</i>

556
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,091
Just don't tell her or anyone
else about the experiment.

557
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,845
We're onto something much bigger
than we imagined.

558
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,434
- So, that happened.
- What is it?

559
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,687
Matty, you ever been
to a Native American orgy?

560
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,315
- No.
- It's fucking intense.

561
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,109
I don't get it.

562
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,320
If I'm doing my math correctly,
then there is a good chance

563
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,030
that I'm on my way here right now.

564
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,699
- How do you know?
- 'Cause it's what I did before.

565
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,004
I'm telling you,
this is where I'm coming next.

566
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,589
We don't know that for sure.

567
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,966
We need to keep you
isolated from the world

568
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,761
as much as possible to avoid
any collisions of causality.

569
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,639
But my being here hasn't
effected any real change yet.

570
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,140
That we know about.

571
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,851
We have to make sure that the machine
doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

572
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,229
Uncover the conspiracy
before it's too late.

573
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,231
What are you now, a secret agent?

574
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,651
You're a scientist,
and as a man of science,

575
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:58,029
you need to step back, breathe,

576
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,574
and take a moment
to properly analyze the data.

577
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,035
Jim: Fine.

578
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:07,789
Let me stay here and observe this
strange new habitat I've encountered.

579
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:09,999
Oh.

580
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,668
What is this?

581
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:14,629
It's a remote control.

582
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,757
In our time, we use it
to operate the television.

583
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,384
Oh, wow.

584
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,095
In the future, we control
the TV with our minds.

585
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:25,223
Matty: Oh, right.

586
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,058
You're only five days ahead of us.

587
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,601
This isn't a game.

588
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,062
You're now part
of the experiment, Jim,

589
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:32,647
the same as the dahlia.

590
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:35,692
That means we have
to study you the same way,

591
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,527
follow the process.

592
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,821
I need you to go step by step

593
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:42,282
and tell us exactly
how you did it.

594
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,742
What did it feel like?

595
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,703
The wormhole opened. I jumped in.

596
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,998
I don't know why you're
being so obtuse.

597
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:53,918
Because we're wasting time
sitting around here yapping about it.

598
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,671
We must take action. I got duped.

599
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,465
We have to strike back.

600
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:02,010
We can't do anything until we
fully understand what happened.

601
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,430
We are messing with the primal
forces of nature here.

602
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,101
The primal forces of nature
are telling me I have to take a piss.

603
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,738
What are you doing here, Jim?

604
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,115
I went to the lab.
You guys were gone.

605
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,825
You should go back.
We'll meet you there.

606
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,661
No, no, no, you called. You said
something... We were onto something.

607
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,955
And what was this stuff about Abby?
And you were...

608
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,547
My head is killing me.

609
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,383
See? I told you, you need to stop
popping those pills

610
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:43,718
and get some sleep.

611
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,679
What did you mean earlier
when you were talking about Abby?

612
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,348
Let me get you some pills.

613
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,355
Stay in here. Don't come out,

614
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:58,358
no matter what you hear.
Give me the aspirin.

615
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,861
Matty: Chuck, I get it now.
It makes sense.

616
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,322
I finally see it now.
Fucking intense.

617
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,701
Matty, stop.
You're giving Jim a headache.

618
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:09,911
No, this isn't a headache.

619
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,747
This, this is a lightning storm
between my temples.

620
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,375
What were you saying earlier?

621
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:17,460
When we were on the phone, you said
something about not trusting Abby

622
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,213
and then we were
onto something bigger.

623
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,592
Matty: No, no, no.

624
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,010
- No, no, no, no.
- Matty.

625
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,638
- This is far too much to calculate.
- You have to keep it together.

626
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,391
- Matty, look at me.
- You can't... No, no.

627
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:34,060
Look at me. Sing the pi song.

628
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:37,564
<i>- ♪ 3. 14159 ♪</i>
- Yeah, there you go. Sing it.

629
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,441
<i>- ♪ 265358 ♪</i>
- Yeah.

630
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,777
<i>♪ 93238... ♪</i>

631
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,073
Jim.

632
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:52,996
Shit.

633
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,250
Time travel made that guy
a real asshole.

634
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,821
The drink offer is rescinded.

635
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,114
<i>Okay.</i>

636
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,910
<i>But what about coffee?
Does that count?</i>

637
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,621
<i>I never had a chance
to finish my coffee.</i>

638
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,623
What do you want, Jim?

639
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,042
<i>Look, I know I left
without saying goodbye,</i>

640
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,210
<i>but if you let me back up,
I just want a chance</i>

641
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,254
<i>to apologize for leaving
the way that I did.</i>

642
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:44,857
So, let's hear it.

643
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:50,071
It better be good if you want
to see what's underneath.

644
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,490
I know what's underneath... trouble.

645
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,119
Do I really have to explain
how this works?

646
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:58,162
You grovel at my feet.

647
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,498
And then...

648
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,291
I came here with a plan.

649
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,795
There's so much that I want to say.

650
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,050
I don't know where to start.

651
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:24,063
There's certain tribes in the Amazon
where women use shamanistic ritual

652
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,649
to control their men
by driving them to insanity.

653
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:29,861
Are you a shaman?

654
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,697
No, I'm just a girl.

655
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,785
I'm sorry.

656
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,497
I'll take it.

657
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,117
- Ow!
- Ow!

658
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,830
<i>Is this the residence
of Abby Ross?</i>

659
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:26,209
<i>She's not here.</i>

660
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,961
This is Jim Beale.
I'm a friend of hers.

661
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,673
Hey, sleepyhead, looking for me?

662
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,760
<i>Is there a man in your place?</i>

663
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,970
Abby: <i>I guess you buzzed
my neighbor by accident.</i>

664
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:42,642
<i>- I need to see your flower.
- Wow, classy. I am a lady.</i>

665
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,103
<i>You can at least buy me
breakfast first.</i>

666
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,456
Jim: <i>The biggest obstacle
in opening a wormhole</i>

667
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,874
<i>is creating enough energy.</i>

668
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,085
<i>Not unlike the tremendous
amount of energy</i>

669
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:12,004
<i>that an entire planet makes
as it spins on its axis.</i>

670
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,548
<i>The power is there.</i>

671
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,341
<i>I just thought of a way
to utilize it.</i>

672
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,190
Double or nothing if I hit it again.

673
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:32,650
I'll take those odds.

674
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,573
The booze just hit me.
Not much of a drinker.

675
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,520
Give me that.

676
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,567
Ready?

677
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,959
Not being found is hard.

678
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,420
Especially when there's two of you.

679
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,382
That's not me,
'cause I'm sitting right here.

680
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,426
He might as well be some other guy.

681
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,804
But it's not.
That is you a week younger.

682
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,265
But from now on,
she's only gonna be with me.

683
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,184
How can you know that?

684
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,604
Because that's what
I'm about to make sure of.

685
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,356
Whoa, Jim. Jim!

686
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,900
This isn't some relationship problem.

687
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,651
It's a little bigger than you
and that girl.

688
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,195
Not to me. Not anymore.

689
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:07,615
You can't go around changing the past
because you got your feelings hurt.

690
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,283
This is not the past for you.

691
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,619
I'm not changing
anyone's past but my own.

692
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:15,206
No matter what happens to that guy,
I'm still gonna feel this way, right?

693
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,626
I have no idea. You're the first
person to ever do this.

694
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:20,628
Well, then the only way that
I know how to fix my past

695
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,296
is by taking control of my future.

696
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,965
What about the fact that she's
using you to get to the machine?

697
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,010
She's not. She's using him.

698
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:31,305
And that puts me in a fantastic
position to turn it all around.

699
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,786
Jim?

700
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,704
You okay?

701
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,249
Chuck. You found me.

702
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,961
Technology's come a long way.
Not being found is hard.

703
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,779
You taste like ash.

704
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,119
Who's that?

705
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,915
Just ignore it. They'll go away.

706
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:42,460
Will they?

707
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:43,919
They will.

708
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:57,892
It's Klaus.

709
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,480
Then definitely ignore it.

710
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,941
Doesn't he know I'm here?

711
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,862
I don't care if he knows or not.

712
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,365
Well, tell him. Tell him everything
is going according to plan.

713
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,452
- What are you talking about?
- Answer it.

714
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,412
I want to hear what you two
have to say to each other.

715
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:20,956
Fine.

716
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,381
I can't invite you in, Klaus.
Jim Beale is here,

717
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,717
and he's about to fuck
the shit out of me again.

718
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,067
Well, what are you waiting for?

719
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,988
I just cut off my only source
of income for you,

720
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,407
so better make it worth it.

721
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,785
So you do work for him.

722
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,453
He was funding my research.

723
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,830
You're working
on a time-travel project for him.

724
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:05,501
- It's not for him.
- So why is he paying you for it?

725
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,963
You know, for a brilliant man,
you really are quite dim.

726
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,589
Please, enlighten me.

727
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,299
Don't make me say it.

728
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,468
Come on, the truth will
set you free, remember?

729
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,476
'Cause I was fucking him, all right?

730
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,021
Yeah, he paid my bills and my rent,

731
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:27,565
and whatever else I needed.

732
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,650
So then, why me?

733
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,737
It ended for me the night
you and I first met,

734
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,407
but it wasn't official
until right now.

735
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:39,118
So you jump at the first guy
who comes along?

736
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,956
I mean, you must have had ulterior
motives to fuck me like you did.

737
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,960
You are being a childish asshole.

738
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,509
And you're right.

739
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:57,052
I was using you.

740
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:59,388
I was using you for my research.

741
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:03,350
A ploy to steal my ideas
for your nefarious scheme.

742
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,937
So, what is it?

743
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:08,814
Let's get all the cards on the table.

744
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,985
It's... it's not done yet.

745
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:14,778
Waiting for my next move, huh?

746
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:16,864
Well, you're making it.

747
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,158
You want to see what I'm working on?

748
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,414
I'll be down at the pub
drinking this day off.

749
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,300
Abby: <i>Working in secret for two years</i>

750
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,677
<i>in a hidden lab
on the outskirts of the city,</i>

751
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,264
<i>John Bane's prototype
had become the stuff of legend.</i>

752
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,477
<i>They say he invented a time machine.</i>

753
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:51,649
<i>But what no one knew was that only
moments before I met him,</i>

754
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,400
<i>it had actually worked.</i>

755
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:54,985
Do you have a light?

756
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,445
<i>I knew everything
there was to know</i>

757
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,656
<i>about John Bane the physicist,</i>

758
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,701
<i>but I never imagined I would get
to know John Bane the man.</i>

759
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,748
Jim: A science fiction novel.

760
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,044
More of a novella at this point.

761
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,592
Your hero, John Bane,
that's supposed to be me.

762
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,974
There was an article about you
that inspired the idea, yeah.

763
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,559
<i>But once I met you...</i>

764
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,520
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

765
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,690
<i>John, a physicist named
John Bane.</i>

766
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,692
The whole story got
a lot more involved.

767
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,652
That's why it's not done yet.

768
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,196
<i>I wanted to see
how it played out.</i>

769
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,866
Yeah, but it's not actually me.

770
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,411
<i>It's just a version of me.</i>

771
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,038
<i>It doesn't have my memories
or feelings.</i>

772
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,419
That's unfortunate.

773
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,088
Abby: <i>If we only had time.</i>

774
01:01:57,673 --> 01:01:58,924
<i>Time to get closer.</i>

775
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:01,051
I'm just a girl.

776
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,095
The girl of my dreams.

777
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,849
<i>We could have a chance
of something real.</i>

778
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,397
<i>I led myself to believe
in serendipity.</i>

779
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,735
<i>But the cosmos had a cruel way
of making me believe otherwise.</i>

780
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,989
<i>As the day of the final
experiment grew near,</i>

781
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:24,199
<i>I wondered if we had
a future together.</i>

782
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,118
<i>Or would fate keep us apart?</i>

783
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,540
What happens from here
on out is up to me.

784
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,751
That's why I'm here
with you right now.

785
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,547
But you can't change fate.

786
01:02:38,714 --> 01:02:41,091
It's like trying to make
the sun set with your mind.

787
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:45,637
Who's to say I can't?

788
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,111
See that?

789
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,405
That right there... I did that.

790
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,199
Tell me I didn't.

791
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,743
Scientists and their God complex.

792
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,543
I'm supposed to be the smoker here.

793
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,892
- Are you okay?
- Chuck: Jim, are you okay?

794
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,762
- Jim?
<i>- It's not Jim.</i>

795
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,889
<i>It's Abby. There's something
wrong with Jim.</i>

796
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,766
<i>He's coughing up blood, and he's...</i>

797
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,935
<i>he's been having seizures,
and I don't know what to do.</i>

798
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:16,728
<i>Can you please...
can you please come?</i>

799
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,648
<i>He won't let me take him
to the hospital. I'm just--</i>

800
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:21,817
- Abby, Abby.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

801
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:25,612
Don't do anything until I get there.
Don't call anyone.

802
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,656
Don't do anything.

803
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,992
- I'm coming.
<i>- Okay.</i>

804
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,802
Wait, what are you doing?

805
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:52,764
Uh... Tell Jim Prime
I'm taking this to a specialist

806
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,600
for more
intensive examination.

807
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,442
Where's the other one?

808
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,737
Chuck took it to an examinist
for further specialization.

809
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:08,071
Must be who called.

810
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,449
Wait, what are you doing?

811
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,242
I'm taking it back
to its rightful owner.

812
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,419
Wormhole.

813
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,546
Such a weird word
when you think about it.

814
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,591
Chuck: Right now he's experiencing

815
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:30,844
what can only be described
as a kind of temporal feedback.

816
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:34,222
It seems that two beings
of the same consciousness

817
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,266
cannot exist in the same universe.

818
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:43,023
This must be nature's way
of correcting the anomaly.

819
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:46,109
That's your diagnosis?
Temporal feedback?

820
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:48,779
That makes the most sense
given what we know.

821
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:54,534
Okay, Dr. Chuck, if you're
such an expert on space cancer,

822
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,495
then what should
we expect from here?

823
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:00,749
If the rate of deterioration
stays in sync with 0-14,

824
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,335
terminus... that's what we call...

825
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:04,753
I get it. What?

826
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,340
He has about 48 hours, give or take.

827
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,052
Then his vital organs
will disintegrate

828
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:14,471
until his biological functions
shut down.

829
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,932
He's been chosen for extinction.

830
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:20,519
You have one hell
of a bedside manner.

831
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,939
I'm a physicist, not an M.D.

832
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:27,943
How am I supposed to believe
any of this?

833
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,838
Now's your chance.

834
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,423
This is your proof right here.

835
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,425
But please handle with care.

836
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,593
The fate of the universe
is in your hands.

837
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,689
Jim.

838
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:07,941
I really wasn't expecting you.

839
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:13,447
You might want to hide in
the other room in case he comes in.

840
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,407
He won't.
He thinks Klaus is in here.

841
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,617
No need to tell me who's in there.

842
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,287
- I have my theory.
- And what is that?

843
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:23,832
I'm not giving
any more theories to you.

844
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:27,502
It's not why I came here.
It's not what I want from this.

845
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,338
And what do you want from this?

846
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:34,384
To ignore the facts,
give you the benefit of the doubt.

847
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:37,929
All of the observable evidence

848
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:41,725
leads to the inevitable conclusion
that you are playing me.

849
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:44,853
But I refuse to accept it.

850
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,024
I barely know you.

851
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:53,612
But something happened in those
brief hours we spent together.

852
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,698
It was how you looked at me.

853
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,326
Like how you're looking at me now.

854
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,662
Is the pain worse when he's close by?

855
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:03,830
Yeah.

856
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,503
Proximity to him must be a factor.

857
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:13,215
The best course of action
is to get you out of town

858
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,717
as far as possible to alleviate
the effects of the feedback.

859
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:17,469
You mean prolong the inevitable.

860
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:20,514
So, here it is. My act of faith.

861
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:22,974
The gun is to my head.

862
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,770
I'm sure as shit not gonna
pull the trigger myself.

863
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:29,689
This is yours.

864
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,442
You get to decide what happens.

865
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:35,612
In two days, I'm gonna
start the machine,

866
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,364
and I'm gonna open the wormhole.

867
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,536
But it's now up to you
what goes through it.

868
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:05,517
Chuck, I want you to take your friend
and get the fuck out of here.

869
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,477
- Okay.
- Abby.

870
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,187
You lied to me.

871
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,730
Not about me and you.

872
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,400
Me and you is all
totally based on bullshit.

873
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:14,901
If you could just
see my logic on this.

874
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,069
Don't.

875
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,321
There's an explanation for all of it.

876
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,031
Not for how I feel.

877
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:22,951
I'm not even sure
who I'm talking to right now,

878
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,037
but whatever Jim you are,

879
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,747
I want you to get
the hell out of my house

880
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:31,334
before I contract
this psychotic disease.

881
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,046
I don't think that temporal
feedback is contagious.

882
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,214
No.

883
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,684
Matty? Where's Jim Prime?

884
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:52,647
I need you to slip away
and meet me at our place.

885
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,985
Tell him that you left
your reading glasses at home.

886
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:58,570
He knows you're useless without them.

887
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:03,074
Then break them and tell him you have
to go get your other pair.

888
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,368
Just do it, and...

889
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,456
...bring D-29B.

890
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:16,254
Dextro 29 boost. Still in beta.

891
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:21,635
It's a hybrid synthesis
of adrenal epinephrine secretions.

892
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,304
- Oh, yeah.
- It won't keep you alive.

893
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,848
But when you take it,
you won't know you're dying.

894
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:29,351
I'm dying. I'm dying, yes.

895
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,979
Yeah, okay. All right, what to do?

896
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,940
What to do? What to do? I'm dying.

897
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:37,484
Dying. Death, dead, 48 hours.

898
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:41,071
Forty eight hours. We have to prevent
that, don't we? We do. We should.

899
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:42,489
I say we don't do anything.

900
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:44,074
Don't open the other end
of the wormhole.

901
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,243
- Then it's like it never happened.
- Have you considered--

902
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,954
I'm here.
It happened. Yes... yes, it did.

903
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,872
- But have you considered--
- Yes, it did.

904
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:53,541
No, we roll up our sleeves.
We find a workable solution,

905
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,085
to explain the absence
of paradoxes--

906
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:56,878
We have to get one of you
out of here.

907
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:59,923
Let's come clean with Jim Prime.
He can go, and you can live.

908
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,967
He's not gonna do it
if he knows he will die.

909
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,718
Would you? No, you wouldn't.

910
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,929
I wouldn't.
I've been... I mean, I did.

911
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,014
- I'm here, so...
- There is the notion--

912
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,474
Maybe it should be me that goes.

913
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,142
And make things worse?

914
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,602
- The theory...
- Are you joking?

915
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,604
Is he joking? Make things worse?

916
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,732
I have less than two days to live.
I lost the rights to my life's work.

917
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,527
My girlfriend, she hates me, so how
could it possibly get any worse?

918
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:21,945
Parallel dimensions.

919
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:24,698
Parallel dimensions.

920
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:27,701
There exists not one
singular universe,

921
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,412
but an infinite number
of possibilities coinciding

922
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,706
simultaneously and eternally,

923
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,875
every conceivable version
of every being persisting forward

924
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,419
in a concurrent reality.

925
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:39,921
Your time-space excursion
was not to the past

926
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,548
of your present universe.

927
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:43,300
On the contrary, it was simply

928
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,218
a migration from
your plane of existence

929
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:46,720
to the one adjacent.

930
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,889
You're operating
independently of yourself

931
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,099
in an alternate timeline.

932
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,939
- No.
- But--

933
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,858
That's still hypothetical
at this point.

934
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:01,484
And, of course,
I already thought of that.

935
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,112
But being here, seeing it for myself,

936
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:05,905
everything played out
exactly the same.

937
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,533
But your journal accounted for--

938
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,784
What journal?

939
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,078
Where did you get this?

940
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,913
It was in your coat pocket
when you traversed.

941
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,665
And you've had this the whole time?

942
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,293
I was processing it as a data set.

943
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,879
- It's not my handwriting.
- You were both so busy.

944
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,923
- This is her book.
- Whose book?

945
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,300
Abby's.

946
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:27,594
- It was alarmingly accurate.
- Matty?

947
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,431
This is a made-up story,
a work of fiction,

948
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:33,183
and an incomplete one at that.

949
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,769
Okay, enough theorizing.

950
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,604
All right? The machine
should be up and running.

951
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:39,189
How much more of this
go juice do you have?

952
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:40,440
Enough.

953
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,317
All right, I'm pulling
the trigger on our best option.

954
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:45,153
Klaus only paid for
one unit of M.R.D.

955
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,613
We can't do this again.

956
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,031
If I go back through the wormhole

957
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,325
knowing what I know now
to that first day...

958
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,786
we won't have to do this ever again.

959
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,383
I can take over from here.

960
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,801
Where have you been?

961
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,053
Uh, our mass spectrometer
was on the fritz.

962
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:14,224
I wanted to take 0-14 over to
the institute for final evaluation.

963
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:16,267
- How's it doing?
- Clean bill of health.

964
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:18,561
But they're gonna keep it tonight

965
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,980
so that they can run it through
the liquid scintillation counter.

966
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,149
Okay, as long as
they don't know what it's for.

967
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:24,526
They think it's a sample.

968
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,736
We're almost online.

969
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,238
You want to do a practice run?

970
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:29,823
Absolutely.

971
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,103
Oh, and, Chuck,

972
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,689
dahlia 2.0 is also gone for now,

973
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:05,316
so we have to send something else
through the wormhole.

974
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,570
I think I can find a replacement.

975
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,243
Balance metric pressure at 057.

976
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,496
Chuck: Metric pressure
sustaining 057.

977
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:19,914
Releasing valves.

978
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,839
Man: Docking hatch open and clear.

979
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,216
Chuck: Radioactivity meters online.

980
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:31,593
Ready for exposure.

981
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,055
Prepare to load M.R.D.

982
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,547
M.R.D. removed from containment.

983
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,174
Preparing to load.

984
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,304
Keep full exposure duration
no more than ten seconds.

985
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:18,431
Nine, eight...

986
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:19,766
seven...

987
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:22,435
Insertion of M.R.D. commencing.

988
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,855
...five, four...

989
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,399
three, two...

990
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:29,817
one.

991
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:31,778
M.R.D. in place.

992
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,029
Close hatch.

993
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,491
Jim. Jim, Jim.

994
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:39,577
The pressure dropped below 029.

995
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,037
We have to abort.

996
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:45,458
All right, abort.
It's that damn bracket again.

997
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,585
We're gonna have
to reconfigure the output.

998
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:48,962
I know how to fix it.

999
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,673
It might take a while to recalibrate.
Why don't you take a break?

1000
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,716
I don't take breaks.

1001
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:58,263
What about that stack
of readouts in your office?

1002
01:15:58,429 --> 01:15:59,639
Have you gone through those yet?

1003
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,394
Oh.

1004
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:08,064
I see what you're doing.

1005
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,109
You do?

1006
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,194
You want me to sleep.

1007
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,490
You're onto me.

1008
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,701
Fine.

1009
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,621
I'll leave you be to work
on that for a bit.

1010
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:29,502
But I'm not napping.

1011
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,356
Okay, Jim, get ready.

1012
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,821
Matty, close the docking hatch.

1013
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,575
Handle left 45 degrees.

1014
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:01,743
Slide forward,

1015
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,871
then lock at high noon
and engage sequence.

1016
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:06,956
Chuck, I don't, uh...

1017
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,208
Matty, let's go.

1018
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,294
The left and right...

1019
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:14,130
Matty, he could come back any second.

1020
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,341
The left and right,
they're not, um...

1021
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,550
The left and right...

1022
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:19,636
Matty, you've done it
a thousand times.

1023
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:21,346
Do it now.

1024
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:38,005
You're still chasing after her, huh?

1025
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:43,928
I never realize that's what
I'm doing... until I do it.

1026
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,184
The power to cross
the universe in an instant.

1027
01:18:51,436 --> 01:18:53,354
The impossible dream
becomes possible.

1028
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:57,150
All the unbelievable things
you could accomplish,

1029
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,318
the eternal questions
you could answer.

1030
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,363
And you just want to get laid.

1031
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:06,033
- You'd do the same if it were you.
- You're probably right.

1032
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:09,829
The machine still works.

1033
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,914
But the M.R.D. is gone.

1034
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,834
We could try to find the money.

1035
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:17,545
Thirty six hours? I don't see how.

1036
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:19,547
What about Klaus?

1037
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,054
You have seen the future.

1038
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:30,349
Could buy some stocks,
play the over-under on a game.

1039
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,227
You didn't happen to catch
the news before you left?

1040
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,354
It's over.

1041
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,398
I'm done with the past.

1042
01:19:42,612 --> 01:19:44,113
If this is goodbye...

1043
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,367
...least I could do
is buy you dinner.

1044
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:52,705
Okay.

1045
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:13,726
We'll let Jim Prime
keep on without a clue,

1046
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,436
at least until you're gone.

1047
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,897
Yeah. Where's Matty?

1048
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,320
He was devastated by what he did.

1049
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,447
Didn't want to face you.

1050
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:35,248
This is you.

1051
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:37,375
I mean him.

1052
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,710
I should take this.

1053
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,088
Go ahead and order.
I'll be right back.

1054
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,355
Abby: It's not done yet.

1055
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:11,951
Chuck told me everything.

1056
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,162
Chuck is an asshole.

1057
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,249
I want to hear it from you.

1058
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:22,211
Why did you really
go through the wormhole?

1059
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,548
Because my heart was broken.

1060
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:31,012
And you blame me?

1061
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,765
Abby, the only one
to blame here is me.

1062
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,809
I did it to myself.

1063
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,903
I'm willing to let technology
take some of the fall here.

1064
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,202
So, I understand the only way

1065
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:57,496
to get the other Jim
into the wormhole

1066
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:01,459
is to show up tomorrow
with the dahlia and Klaus.

1067
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,128
That is one scenario, yeah.

1068
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,714
One that I would prefer
not to repeat.

1069
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:08,716
But if it would save your life...

1070
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:11,260
It wouldn't, because we're
about five million shy

1071
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:12,762
of there even being a wormhole.

1072
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:14,889
I can get the money.

1073
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:19,894
No.

1074
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:22,688
Waitress:
Any questions about the menu?

1075
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:27,026
Can you please give us a minute?

1076
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:31,697
But it would be for us.

1077
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,367
Then we can have more time together.

1078
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:37,244
Look! I'm not gonna let you do that.

1079
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,747
It's my choice, not yours.

1080
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:42,875
Then it'll be your choice.

1081
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,014
Take me as far as you can.

1082
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,733
Checking in?

1083
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:50,776
Yes.

1084
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,111
Name, please.

1085
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:53,654
James Beale.

1086
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:07,585
Seems you are already staying
with us, Mr. Beale.

1087
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:10,755
What?

1088
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,803
Right.

1089
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:19,889
I forgot my key card.

1090
01:24:21,057 --> 01:24:22,808
May I get a replacement, please?

1091
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,271
Of course.

1092
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,815
Matty: <i>There exists not one
singular universe,</i>

1093
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,318
<i>but an infinite number
of possibilities coinciding</i>

1094
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:39,737
<i>simultaneously and eternally.</i>

1095
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:52,166
<i>Every conceivable version
of every being persisting forward</i>

1096
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:55,377
<i>in a concurrent reality.
Your time-space excursion</i>

1097
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:57,963
<i>was not to the past
of your present universe.</i>

1098
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,965
<i>On the contrary,
it was simply</i>

1099
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,926
<i>a migration from
your plane of existence</i>

1100
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:03,260
<i>to the one adjacent.</i>

1101
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:11,518
Abby: <i>John Bane's time-space
excursion was not to his own past.</i>

1102
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:14,271
<i>Little did he realize
he had traveled to the past</i>

1103
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:15,940
<i>of a parallel universe...</i>

1104
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:19,401
<i>A timeline so similar to his own,</i>

1105
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,781
<i>he had simply overlooked
the differences.</i>

1106
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,035
<i>An infinite number of possibilities,</i>

1107
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,329
<i>an infinite number of choices,</i>

1108
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,748
<i>an infinite number of outcomes.</i>

1109
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:38,045
Take me to The Grand Hotel.

1110
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,786
Mr. Meisner, would you be so kind

1111
01:30:15,953 --> 01:30:19,373
as to wait here while I escort
Ms. Ross and her dahlia

1112
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:20,791
to the lab floor?

1113
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:32,052
Is this really what you want?

1114
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,097
Isn't there usually champagne
at these things?

1115
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:37,099
I could kill
a whole bottle right now.

1116
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,476
Oh, so, this is the way
it's gonna be.

1117
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:42,479
It's the way it has to be.

1118
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:43,981
The way it is.

1119
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,317
It only seems that way now,

1120
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:50,154
but eventually you'll see it
in a different light.

1121
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,947
So that's it, then? It meant nothing.

1122
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,831
Put these on.
I don't want you to miss a thing.

1123
01:31:49,213 --> 01:31:51,298
Jim: Turn handle left 45 degrees.

1124
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:53,842
Slide forward.

1125
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,762
Lock it at high noon.

1126
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,306
Engage sequence.

1127
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,248
I'm not interested,
so don't even try.

1128
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:36,046
It may not look like it,
but I'm actually working.

1129
01:34:36,213 --> 01:34:37,631
Do you know who I am?

1130
01:34:37,798 --> 01:34:38,965
Should I?

1131
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,388
Oh, my God.

1132
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:46,932
You look just like him.

1133
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,184
Who?

1134
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,145
John.

1135
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:55,524
A physicist named John Bane.

1136
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:59,653
What a coincidence. I'm a physicist.

1137
01:35:01,113 --> 01:35:03,115
They say he invented a time machine.

1138
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:04,908
Did he?

1139
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,245
No one knows.

1140
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:12,999
Anyways, he died in a lab explosion
before I got to interview him.

1141
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,251
Really?

1142
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:16,211
That's too bad.

1143
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:18,338
The fire destroyed all of his work.

1144
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:21,758
It's sad, really.

1145
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,928
To be so close to controlling time,

1146
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:28,682
and then poof... gone in an instant.

1147
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:33,437
Time is a great teacher

1148
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:35,355
that eventually kills
all of its students.

1149
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:41,987
I like that one. That's a good one.

1150
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,283
You have any more?

1151
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:50,954
Yeah. Have a drink with me.

1152
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:54,499
I'll tell you all about
my time-travel experiment.

1153
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:57,753
Mine would make
for a much better story.

1154
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:00,797
Your story is better?

1155
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:02,799
Is that a fact?

1156
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:06,178
No, just a theory.
