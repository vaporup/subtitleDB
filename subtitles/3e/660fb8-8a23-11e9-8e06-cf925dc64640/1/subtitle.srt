00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,740
<i>'Ben'</i>

2
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:24,282
Michelle, please don't hang up.

3
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,095
Just talk to me, okay?

4
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,909
I can't believe you just left.

5
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:31,389
Michelle

6
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:33,647
Come back.

7
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,162
Please say something.

8
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:41,113
Michelle? Talk to me.

9
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,442
Look, we had an argument, couples fight,
that is ..

10
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:47,144
No reason to just leave everything behind.

11
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,073
Running away isn't going to help anything.
Michelle, please ..

12
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,897
<i>Elsewhere today, power
has still not been</i>

13
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,153
<i>restored to many cities
on the Southern seaboard.</i>

14
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,593
<i>In the wake of this afternoon's
widespread blackout..</i>

15
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,318
<i>There has been some inclement
weather in the region,</i>

16
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:13,878
<i>Problems seem linked to what authorities
are calling a catastrophic power surge.</i>

17
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,029
<i>That has crippled traffic in the area.</i>

18
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:36,477
'NO SIGNAL'

19
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,873
Okay, ok .. please.

20
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:18,255
Please ..

21
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,220
Please don't hurt me.

22
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,304
Please,

23
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:32,447
Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anybody,
I promise.

24
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,855
Please just let me go. Please.

25
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,598
You need fluids.

26
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:39,420
You were in shock.

27
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,340
What're you going to do to me?

28
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:49,033
I'm going to keep you alive.

29
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:00,371
Work on getting handy with these.

30
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:07,687
My boyfriend was expecting me.

31
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,549
He'll send the cops looking.

32
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,287
I'm sorry ..

33
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,371
But no one is looking for you.

34
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,007
You got some fight in you.

35
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:03,758
I can respect that.

36
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:08,082
But don't even think
about trying that again.

37
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,873
You're lucky to be here at all.

38
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:16,998
My generosity only extends .. so far.

39
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:20,604
Eggs,

40
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,609
Tylenol to help with your pain.

41
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:28,978
Please .. please .. just let me go.

42
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,413
- Please.
- There's nowhere to go, Michelle.

43
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:37,218
That looks pretty.

44
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,058
Given it as how I saved your life,
I think that's acceptable.

45
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,373
You're lucky to be here at all.

46
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:47,635
- What do you mean?
- I found you.

47
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,466
And I saved your life,
by bringing you here.

48
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,822
I don't understand,

49
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,991
There's been an attack.

50
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:12,373
What?

51
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:15,080
An attack. A big one.

52
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,133
I'm not sure yet if it's
chemical, or nuclear.

53
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:20,813
But down here we're safe.

54
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,182
And where are we, exactly?

55
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:26,098
Underneath my farmhouse.

56
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:29,053
40 miles outside of Lake Charles.

57
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:34,662
- I .. was driving north of here.
- You were in an accident.

58
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:41,978
You were turned over on the side of the
road. I was driving by, and I saw you.

59
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:45,526
I saved your life, Michelle.

60
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:48,653
I couldn't just leave you there.

61
00:16:56,538 --> 00:17:00,333
Thank you so much, for saving my life. I ..

62
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,862
I guess I should, I should
go to a hospital, now.

63
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,422
You can't leave.

64
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,444
An attack means all of them.

65
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:17,844
Which contaminates the air above ground.
That's, that's how it works.

66
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:20,462
How, how long do we have
to wait until it's safe?

67
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:24,169
Depends on the proximity to the
closest blast. One year, maybe two.

68
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:29,893
And that's if we're, we're talking
about weapons that we know of.

69
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,649
Russians were developing
some nasty stuff. And

70
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:35,018
it the martians finally
found a way to get here.

71
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:40,133
Their weapons will, will make our nukes
look like, like sticks and stones.

72
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,809
Luckily,

73
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:47,386
I prepared for this.

74
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,622
I need to use your phone, then,

75
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:03,800
To call my family.
And, and tell them that I'm safe here.

76
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:07,515
- And make sure they're okay.
- Michelle, they're not okay.

77
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,773
How do you know that?

78
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,173
Everyone outside of here is dead.

79
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,342
What about you?
Don't you have a family?

80
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:30,228
No.

81
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,333
Who's that?

82
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,084
Excuse me.

83
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,312
What is it now?

84
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:48,849
Wait.

85
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:02,035
You know what, Michelle?
I'm going to tell you, what I told him..

86
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,595
You need to eat, you need to sleep,

87
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,609
And you need to start showing me a
little bit of appreciation.

88
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,262
My name is Howard, by the way.

89
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,586
God, oh shit.

90
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,818
I'm sorry,

91
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:11,258
Sorry about that. I didn't mean to ..

92
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:12,798
Scare you.

93
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,542
You, hmm, hmm, you hungry?

94
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,666
So how're you doing, huh? You okay?

95
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,693
What is this?

96
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,155
It's a bunker.

97
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,791
Your room is a bit of a fixer-upper, but ..

98
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:33,631
At least you got the door.

99
00:20:33,938 --> 00:20:36,191
A scary door, but you still got the door.

100
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,462
How long have you been down here?

101
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:43,618
A couple of days, I think. You know,
it's actually kind of hard to tell.

102
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:47,004
No windows, the sunlight, and everything.

103
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,168
I mean, how do we get out of here?

104
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,138
He didn't tell you?

105
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,213
About ..

106
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:00,306
Getting out of here,
is the last thing you want to do.

107
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,809
Cause the air out there,

108
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:04,893
It's contaminated.

109
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,388
I see you've met Emmett

110
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,758
- What happened to him?
- He did that to himself.

111
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:17,560
And his stumbling around
isn't helping anything.

112
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,133
What you heard earlier,

113
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,368
Was him knocking over a shelf with
a whole week's worth of food.

114
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:25,622
Which he's sorry for, correct?

115
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:28,938
Totally.

116
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:35,715
Let's go. Bathroom time.

117
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:51,653
This is the common are. Good for R&R.

118
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:54,968
As you can see, I've
planned for a long stay.

119
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,768
The applaponic system cleans
the air and keeps it fresh.

120
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:02,475
This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.

121
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,013
If you like to watch films,

122
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:08,004
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.

123
00:22:08,048 --> 00:22:11,711
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.

124
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:16,960
The kitchen is fully functional. There's
an electric stove, refrigerator.

125
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:19,324
Freezer, silverware.

126
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:22,958
And that table is a family heirloom,
which means watch your glasses.

127
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:26,040
Always use coasters and placemats.

128
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:29,049
Keep you hands to yourself!

129
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:32,951
Understand?

130
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,062
No touching.

131
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:37,724
Take a seat.

132
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:44,404
This way.

133
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:08,764
This is my private space

134
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:12,880
Off-limits,
unless I give express permission.

135
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,155
Go ahead.

136
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:20,302
- Nah, I don't need to.
- You will though.

137
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,982
And I've got to pace these things out,
so please.

138
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,769
- I need privacy.
- You're welcome to close the curtain.

139
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:35,129
I can't with you standing there.

140
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:40,560
And I can't trust you not to burn this
place down. This is for my own safety.

141
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:44,169
I'm not some .. pervert. Just go.

142
00:23:58,964 --> 00:24:00,849
Don't flush unless you've gone.

143
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:03,902
Can't afford wasting flushes.

144
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,391
Take a seat.

145
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:14,902
Are you hungry?

146
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,022
Those are Megan's.

147
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:26,733
She never went anywhere without two
or three of those things.

148
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:27,942
Who's Megan?

149
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:30,920
Megan's not with us anymore.

150
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,138
Don't worry. Just the generator.

151
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:44,582
Maybe it's a car up front.

152
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:49,840
- That's not possible.
- I heard one earlier.

153
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,129
Above my room.

154
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:54,391
If you had heard a car,
the driver would be long dead by now.

155
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:58,329
Shouldn't we at least try
.. to call the police?

156
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:01,511
Someone to find out
what actually happened?

157
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:02,840
There's no one left to call.

158
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:05,480
See that? Nothing's coming through.

159
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:14,453
You think I sound crazy.

160
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,462
It's amazing, you people..

161
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,733
You wear helmets when you ride your bikes,
you have seat-belts,

162
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:28,031
You're in your cars, you have alarm
systems to protect your homes.

163
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,071
But what do you do when
those alarms go off?

164
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:35,991
Crazy, is building your ark after
the flood is already come.

165
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:46,395
I think now might be time you
met Frank and Mildred.

166
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,314
Closest I can get to in airlock.

167
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:05,435
See?

168
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:10,493
What happened to them?

169
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,835
They weren't as lucky as you.

170
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,898
It's the air, Michelle.

171
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,118
That's what happens when you get exposed.

172
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:37,484
I keep this door sealed, at all times.

173
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:44,720
No one comes in or out.

174
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,124
Met Frank and Mildred, huh?

175
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:01,942
It's funny, right?

176
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:06,586
The whole world ends. And the thing's he's
most upset about is a pair of dead pigs.

177
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:11,009
You gonna need some ..
Uh, reading material.

178
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,195
That's all there is, sorry.

179
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:25,275
My idead of how to learn to do
a french braid, so..

180
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:27,426
If you want me to do that for you,
just let me know.

181
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,528
What do you know about him?

182
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:41,169
He was in the Navy, I know that.

183
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:45,635
I guess he did, uh,
some stuff with satellites.

184
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:48,511
What kinds of stuff?

185
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,249
Satellite .. stuff.

186
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,702
And what brought him out here?

187
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:56,622
I'm not sure.

188
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,026
He bought this property a whle back.

189
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:05,253
I never paid much attention, until he
hired me to help him get this place set up.

190
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,778
The work, was, uh..

191
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:11,031
Entertaining, though, that's for sure.

192
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:15,169
You know, Howard, is like a black belt
in conspiracy theories.

193
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,582
Plus, you know, how often do you get
hired to build the doomsday bunker?

194
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,978
He .. kidnapped you?

195
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
No.

196
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:32,293
What happened to your arm?
You were trying to escape?

197
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:34,049
I was trying to get in.

198
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:39,542
And I watched Howard build this
place, piece by piece, for years.

199
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,124
He was always talking about..

200
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,546
You know, possible attacks,

201
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:47,378
Al-Qeda, Russia, South Korea,

202
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:50,195
- You mean North Korea?
- The, the.. is that the Korean one?

203
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:53,880
Yeah, that one. Hmm ..

204
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,810
And, hmm, you know. Pour
all his money into this

205
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:58,955
place, took to it, like
his life depended on it.

206
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:03,115
Which,.. you know,

207
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,915
That stays with you.

208
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,933
So,

209
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:13,755
He told all this,

210
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:17,795
While you're building his bomb shelter,

211
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,675
And now he says that ..

212
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:22,373
The air is contaminated,
and everybody's dead.

213
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:27,204
Yeah, I know what you're getting at.
But there's more to it.

214
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:28,786
Howard abducted me.

215
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:33,342
He drove me off the road,
and he dragged me here.

216
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:37,635
So whatever he's telling you
about the .. air,

217
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,645
Some big attack. The purpose
of this shelter, is a lie.

218
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:42,809
No, no way.

219
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,480
The attack, I saw it myself.

220
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,240
What do you mean?

221
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:51,075
Coming on my way from work,

222
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,809
And, looked like a flash.

223
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:57,133
Bright red,

224
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,395
Like an explosion, from way far off.

225
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:03,853
Wasn't like fireworks,

226
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:08,960
No, it was more this like something
your read about in the bible.

227
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:15,355
So what you saw was a flashing light?
Lightning?

228
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,382
- Fire that cleared up?
- I'm not .. explaining it right.

229
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,191
This wasn't like anything I've ever seen.

230
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:51,649
Right here,

231
00:31:51,716 --> 00:31:52,716
Above us.

232
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,861
Did you hear someone?

233
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,249
Right above us.

234
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,561
That's impossible.

235
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:09,094
- The, the air, is ..
- What, it's contaminated?

236
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:13,054
- How do you know that?
- Because I told him.

237
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:16,698
Dinner's ready.

238
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:34,427
I see you two are getting along?

239
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,409
How's that sauce?

240
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:13,445
- It's fine,
- As cooks go, I'm okay.

241
00:33:14,512 --> 00:33:16,138
Not great, but okay.

242
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:18,921
Megan was a good cook.

243
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:22,574
You'll learn a little cooking.

244
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:34,494
It's delicious.

245
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:37,658
It's the best sauce I ever tasted.

246
00:33:38,303 --> 00:33:39,694
Are you being funny?

247
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:41,272
No, I mean ..

248
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:44,272
Considering the alternative,
which is, you know..

249
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:48,521
Get burned up in a chemical
attack, or nuclear ..

250
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,409
I say being alive, and down here is ..

251
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,832
It's made a fried turd taste
pretty good, so..

252
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:57,792
Best damn sauce I ever had.

253
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:05,045
And you point, and please watch
your language at the table.

254
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:07,805
Right.

255
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,734
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason.

256
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:16,543
Ever since I got down here,

257
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,267
Tatoos.

258
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:21,561
I always wanted one.

259
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,097
But I never got any. Because
everyone always said, nah,

260
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:27,329
no, Emmett you'll never get
a decent job if you got it.

261
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:28,854
Whatever

262
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:30,641
Like that matters now, right?

263
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:35,312
Tell you what, I had know this was coming,
I'd gotten like 50 of them.

264
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:37,156
That's where I'm at.

265
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:40,016
I would look like a circus
freak or something. I would

266
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:42,223
just be covered. Head to
toe, tattoos all over ..

267
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:46,521
Everywhere, face, shirt, right there.
Across my forehead.

268
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,947
Just my name, Emmett.

269
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:51,658
Or, you know..

270
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,587
"Thug Life"

271
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:55,898
- 'YOLO'

272
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:57,906
I don't even know what
that means, but, I hear

273
00:34:57,918 --> 00:34:59,983
people saying it all the time.
So it must be cool.

274
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:06,027
Hey, what about you, Howard?

275
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:11,134
Anything you wish you'd done?

276
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:16,885
In all honesty, no.

277
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:19,187
No?

278
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:22,934
No crazy nights in Vegas?,

279
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:27,485
Maybe, ah, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

280
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:32,014
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

281
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,961
I focused on being prepared.

282
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:36,503
And I was.

283
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:39,449
And here we are.

284
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,583
Oh, my goodness..

285
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:54,445
Is that Monopoly?

286
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,101
There we go.

287
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:59,427
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

288
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:03,916
I mean, what you say? We're going to be
down here like what, a year, two, three?

289
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:08,218
Bet you if we started a game right now,
we might even get halfway finished..

290
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:09,361
Stop talking!

291
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:21,463
You don't need to make jokes about how
long we're going to be down here.

292
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,818
When nobody knows how
long that's going to be.

293
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:26,356
You humor is not funny.

294
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:30,231
I don't appreciate it while I'm trying
to eat, and neither does Michelle.

295
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:33,418
Now please shut up, and
let us eat in peace.

296
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,112
Emmett?

297
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,987
Pass me a napkin.

298
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,636
I know what you're saying.

299
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:19,436
I never could finish Monopoly.

300
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,267
That game really does take forever, right?

301
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:24,903
For me though, it was .. hmm,

302
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,849
'Chutes, and Ladders'. Ahmm,

303
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:30,903
'Sorry',

304
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,627
and 'Trouble'.

305
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:36,498
And that thing with the dice, and that
thing that you press, what is that called?

306
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:39,814
That, that .. 'PoppleMatic Bubble!',
yeah, right!

307
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,596
You ever play that, what
was it, 'Operation'?

308
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,427
- "Loath 'Operation"
- Oh, man, I couldn't play that game.

309
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,667
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge, when..

310
00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:52,481
- Good lord,
- That was scary.

311
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,018
Can you give me the salt?

312
00:37:58,374 --> 00:37:59,374
Please?

313
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,809
Ah, shoot. Sorry.

314
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:09,352
I'm going to need the pepper also,

315
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:19,689
- What exactly do you think you're doing?
- I'm just asking for the pepper.

316
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:22,832
- The hell you were? What was that?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

317
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:24,707
You trying to insult me?

318
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:28,885
Here in a shelter that I built,
that's keeping you alive?

319
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:31,929
You don't think I see what you just did?

320
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,249
Is that how you thank me
for saving your life?

321
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:36,921
- Calm down.
- Shut Up!

322
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:39,231
Shut Up! And stay in your seat!

323
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:46,832
Is it?

324
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:49,072
Let me tell you,

325
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,241
I know what a traitor looks like,

326
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:53,596
Understand?

327
00:38:55,445 --> 00:39:00,427
I have shown you nothing but
generosity, and hospitality.

328
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:04,832
I want you to apologize.

329
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,952
And tell me you're going to behave.

330
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:12,992
I will.

331
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,556
You will what?

332
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,383
I'll behave.

333
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,227
And I'm so sorry.

334
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:58,778
You have to stay hydrated,.

335
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:07,761
It's easy to forget down here.

336
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:16,276
What's wrong?

337
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,567
Nothing

338
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,454
Where are my keys?

339
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:51,827
Michelle!

340
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:53,183
Stop!

341
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,907
Give me those keys!

342
00:41:08,405 --> 00:41:09,472
- Come on.
- I'm going.

343
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:10,711
No! No!

344
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,165
No! Don't do it!

345
00:41:27,214 --> 00:41:28,131
No!

346
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:29,641
Don't open that door!

347
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:34,383
It's a car!

348
00:41:34,907 --> 00:41:37,311
It's a car! I see a car!

349
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:39,067
Here! Here!

350
00:41:40,036 --> 00:41:41,218
Here!

351
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,917
Michelle, listen to me, don't do it!

352
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:48,289
Help me!

353
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:51,645
- There's a woman.
- Open the door.

354
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,304
I just.. I want
to come inside.

355
00:41:55,316 --> 00:41:57,661
She looks hurt, she
wants me to let her in!

356
00:41:57,707 --> 00:42:00,131
Do not let her in!

357
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:01,901
Look at her face, Michelle!

358
00:42:01,965 --> 00:42:06,241
No, no, no .. no, no.

359
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:09,811
Please open, I don't want to die.

360
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:12,571
Please, help me, I don't want to die.

361
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:18,453
Just a little, oh, please open the door.

362
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,489
- Open it.
- She's begging me!

363
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,191
You can't help her!

364
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:25,691
- Nobody can.
- It'll be okay.

365
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:29,631
It' be okay, all of us.

366
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:32,116
Open the door!

367
00:42:32,156 --> 00:42:33,301
Don't listen to her!

368
00:42:33,374 --> 00:42:36,001
Open the door, you bitch!

369
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:38,339
Let me in!

370
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:44,341
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

371
00:42:45,748 --> 00:42:47,181
Now!

372
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:49,681
Now. Now!

373
00:42:50,116 --> 00:42:51,711
Now!

374
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,951
Open!

375
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:23,611
I know it's hard.

376
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:27,338
Realizing they're all gone.

377
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,236
The ones you love.

378
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:42,818
I have something to confess to you.

379
00:43:45,098 --> 00:43:47,134
I crashed into your car.

380
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,481
Your accident.

381
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:52,369
Was my fault.

382
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:59,129
When I found out about the incoming
attack, I got frantic.

383
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,196
I knew I needed to get back here
as soon as possible,

384
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:04,623
Oh, I was driving like a maniac,

385
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:10,005
I tried to pass you, and..

386
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,609
I'm the reason you went off the road.

387
00:44:18,645 --> 00:44:21,441
And I know I seem like a sensible guy,

388
00:44:22,116 --> 00:44:24,903
But, at the time, I wasn't myself.

389
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,081
It was an accident. But it was my fault.

390
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:34,374
I was afraid to tell you.

391
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:40,191
I'm sorry.

392
00:44:50,171 --> 00:44:51,547
You should shower,

393
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:56,054
You had the smallest amount of air that
came through the hinges, could be toxic.

394
00:44:58,141 --> 00:44:59,765
These are Megan's.

395
00:45:00,854 --> 00:45:02,503
If you want them.

396
00:45:07,236 --> 00:45:09,312
I recognize that woman's car.

397
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:12,421
Her name was Leslie, I think.

398
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:15,587
You knew her?

399
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,609
She was a neighbor.

400
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,631
Emmett wasn't the only one
that knew about this place.

401
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:26,378
If any others somehow survived,
they could be coming here too.

402
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:32,947
As of Friday, kindness and generosity
are antiquated customs.

403
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,898
I'm going to need some stitches.

404
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:54,276
Why, you want me to..?

405
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:56,209
This is your doing, isn't it?

406
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:58,912
I mean,
I don't think I'm really qualified.

407
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:00,369
I'll walk you through it.

408
00:46:04,746 --> 00:46:05,746
Here.

409
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:10,774
Have a drink.

410
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:14,903
What is it?

411
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:17,334
Technically, it's ..

412
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:18,761
Vodka

413
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,983
Safe. I distill it myself.

414
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,279
- I just said I distill
it, I didn't say anything

415
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:40,269
about it tasting good....
Yeah, that's awful.

416
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,709
You want it on the rocks.

417
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:48,260
Little trick I taught
myself as a young man

418
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,744
stationed on a ship, with
way too much free time.

419
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:53,377
Every now and again, if
the CO was working us

420
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:55,824
too hard. We'd freeze
and snap the knob off..

421
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:58,242
The bathroom door while
they were still inside.

422
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:01,478
I guess it took an hour or two, to get out

423
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:06,260
I'm good.

424
00:47:06,386 --> 00:47:07,962
Suit yourself. Cheers.

425
00:47:17,226 --> 00:47:18,589
This is clean.

426
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:21,269
All you need to do is .. stitch.

427
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:45,282
You're doing fine.

428
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:51,362
Stuff I grabbed from your car.

429
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:53,793
Didn't have time to bring in the booze.

430
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,536
Sadly.

431
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:00,016
What is all that?

432
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,873
I wanted to design clothes.

433
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:08,064
No wonder you were so
good with the stiches.

434
00:48:10,731 --> 00:48:12,344
Megan wanted to be an artist.

435
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:16,793
- She was your daughter?
- Yeah

436
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:29,496
She was smart, loved to read,
the magazines or just for fun.

437
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:32,580
She inhaled books.
Anything with Paris.

438
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:35,713
She liked their movies.
Their culture, you know.

439
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:39,647
We used to have this little joke,
every once in a while, I'd ask her..

440
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,851
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

441
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:44,851
And you know what she'd say?

442
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:47,962
French.

443
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:50,802
Anyway,

444
00:48:51,758 --> 00:48:53,709
Her mother turned her against me.

445
00:48:53,826 --> 00:48:55,549
Took her off to Chicago.

446
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:59,366
People are strange creatures

447
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,504
You can't always convince them that
safety is in their own best interest

448
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:07,531
You don't know they're gone.

449
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,500
Anyway,

450
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:13,962
At least I tried to help them.

451
00:49:26,073 --> 00:49:28,771
Hey, you know there is nothing
you could've done for that woman

452
00:49:30,226 --> 00:49:32,838
Even if you had let her in,
she still would've died.

453
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:42,340
You asked earlier about .. regrets,

454
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:46,473
Yeah, I got some of those.

455
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:56,264
Welcome to the club.

456
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:02,642
I mean, I lived my life
in a 40-mile radius.

457
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:07,340
And that was by design,
I made sure that happened.

458
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,091
I was so fast in high school,

459
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,736
I even managed to outrun my bad grades.

460
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,327
I was all-state track,

461
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,220
Three years in a row.

462
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:27,247
Caught a full ride to Louisiana Tech
up there in Ruston.

463
00:50:31,509 --> 00:50:34,580
I remember I spent the last
two weeks of that summer,

464
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:39,242
Showing off the bus ticket they
sent me, to anybody who looked at it

465
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:43,927
And then came the night
before I was supposed to leave,

466
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:49,638
And I just got so worried,

467
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:55,331
About how bad I was
going to do up there

468
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:57,784
With all those smart kids

469
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:03,304
So I went out of my way

470
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,744
To get just pissed wasted, so bad that

471
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:10,626
There was no chance I was waking
up in in the morning.

472
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,420
So I missed the bus

473
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,833
I didn't buy a ticket for the next one

474
00:51:20,936 --> 00:51:22,660
Or the one after that.

475
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:28,300
Well, if you'd gone,
you might be dead now.

476
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:30,038
Well, lucky me, right?

477
00:51:33,136 --> 00:51:34,549
Lucky us.

478
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:43,300
A few, a few years ago,

479
00:51:43,624 --> 00:51:45,353
I was at a hardware store

480
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:49,966
And there was this little girl,
with her Dad.

481
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:53,824
And he was in a hurry,
and she wasn't keeping up.

482
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,376
And he kept

483
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:02,171
yanking on her arm,
really hard, you know.

484
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,047
Too hard.

485
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:10,989
You know that feeling?

486
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:19,549
When my Dad got that way,
my brother Collin was always there.

487
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:22,900
To take the worst of it.
For me.

488
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:28,976
And after seeing that little girl,
I thought maybe I could

489
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:30,878
do that

490
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,940
For her.

491
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:39,207
But I just kept watching

492
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:44,349
And they were about to leave,
and I'd done nothing.

493
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:48,491
And,

494
00:52:49,193 --> 00:52:50,736
she slips

495
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,278
And it throws him out off-balance
and he hits her

496
00:52:56,602 --> 00:52:59,233
And I wanted so badly to do something.

497
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:01,309
To help her, but

498
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:04,353
I do what I always do
when things get hard

499
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:09,153
I just panicked and ran.

500
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:15,571
Look,

501
00:53:15,678 --> 00:53:18,842
We're here, we're alive.

502
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:22,002
And that means something.

503
00:53:25,384 --> 00:53:26,607
Got it?

504
00:54:59,486 --> 00:55:01,131
You've got to be kidding me.

505
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:02,226
What?

506
00:55:02,593 --> 00:55:04,313
We're missing pieces here.

507
00:55:05,322 --> 00:55:06,887
Look at this poor cat.

508
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:09,700
He's been deformed,
he's got one eye.

509
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:13,056
About to go snorkling and
everything too.

510
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:16,593
What are you doing?

511
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:25,546
Ooh, cornering the market on
post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?

512
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:28,756
Needs more axes and chainsaws.

513
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:30,140
For what, she has a shotgun.

514
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:32,242
Yeah, what if up there it's like..

515
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:36,824
- Tracks?
- Zombies.

516
00:55:38,296 --> 00:55:40,989
Though even Howard doesn't
think that one's possible.

517
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,051
Though you should hear his theory
about mutant space-worms.

518
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:51,407
What is that? Howard?

519
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:53,429
Stay calm. We're okay.

520
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:01,931
- What was that?
- Quiet.

521
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:07,153
That sounds like helicopters.

522
00:56:08,189 --> 00:56:11,184
Could be military.
But not ours.

523
00:56:11,962 --> 00:56:13,402
How can you tell?

524
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:16,278
- 14 years in the Navy.
- What's happening up there?

525
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:21,944
My guess, those flashes that kicked
this all off,

526
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:24,256
That was phase 1.

527
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:28,816
Take out your opponent's population
centers, with big hits, all at once

528
00:56:29,722 --> 00:56:32,887
Fast.
And then for round 2.

529
00:56:33,127 --> 00:56:34,816
Ground sweeps.

530
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,896
The satellite log shows an
increase in coded traffic recently.

531
00:56:38,984 --> 00:56:41,596
Possibly extra-terrestrial signals.

532
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:46,033
I bet what we just heard were air-borne
patrols sent to hunt down

533
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,962
the remaining signs of life.
Like us.

534
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,664
Okay, oh boy..

535
00:56:58,762 --> 00:57:00,091
That's bad.

536
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:07,353
And that's worse.

537
00:57:08,536 --> 00:57:09,727
What was up there?

538
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,482
Air filtration system.

539
00:57:13,456 --> 00:57:17,291
I can't.. something is
blocking the hedge.

540
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:23,282
If we can't get it back up, we're
gonna run out of breathable air fast.

541
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:33,748
You're the only one
small enough to reach it.

542
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:35,550
Reach what?

543
00:57:35,593 --> 00:57:38,362
The filtration system.
Through there, the main duct.

544
00:57:38,464 --> 00:57:41,386
Someone needs to get in there
and re-start it.

545
00:57:45,226 --> 00:57:46,482
Give me a hand.

546
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:49,132
Let me go in, she won't
know her way around.

547
00:57:49,144 --> 00:57:51,426
You won't fit, plus your arm.
She'll be fine.

548
00:57:52,153 --> 00:57:58,506
Now, to re-start the unit, you just
swing the handle off and on. Off and on.

549
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:01,273
That should do it.

550
00:58:04,076 --> 00:58:07,318
And neither of us will be able
to go in and help you if you get stuck.

551
00:58:11,296 --> 00:58:12,656
Don't get stuck.

552
00:58:53,873 --> 00:58:54,949
Michelle?

553
00:58:55,353 --> 00:58:57,398
Everything okay up there?

554
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,635
Looks like a dead end.

555
00:59:00,816 --> 00:59:02,309
That's the incline.

556
00:59:02,396 --> 00:59:05,478
Climb up that,
and you're almost there.

557
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,269
Oh, this sucks.

558
01:01:21,113 --> 01:01:22,251
What's wrong?

559
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:27,798
He lied to you, he lied about Megan.

560
01:01:29,146 --> 01:01:30,500
What do you mean?

561
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,896
I think he did something horrible to her.

562
01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:35,816
How?

563
01:01:36,073 --> 01:01:38,607
His family moved to Chicago
years ago.

564
01:01:41,226 --> 01:01:42,513
What's this?

565
01:01:45,544 --> 01:01:47,033
Is that blood?

566
01:01:48,096 --> 01:01:49,322
Come with me.

567
01:01:58,306 --> 01:01:59,322
Wait, that's not Megan...

568
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:11,009
She went missing, two years back.

569
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:17,289
It was on the news and everything.
Most people just thought she skipped town.

570
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:21,297
There is a message up there.

571
01:02:22,382 --> 01:02:25,880
It said 'HELP'. It was scratched
on the inside of the window.

572
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:29,720
This earring was with it.

573
01:02:29,835 --> 01:02:32,013
Did she ever show up,
after she went missing?

574
01:02:36,195 --> 01:02:40,337
He said to me, he said to my face. He said
this is his daughter, he said this...

575
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,560
He took her and he killed her.

576
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,560
I was just thinking,

577
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:20,684
Maybe we

578
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:22,133
take away his gun

579
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,293
Tie him up, to confess. Whatever it is he's
done - What confess to who, the police?

580
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:30,297
Look, like I said,

581
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:33,244
We can't be the only survivors, right?

582
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:38,257
- The woman, she was able to get around a
little, right?... Yeah, till she died.

583
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:41,271
Directly above us, choking to death.

584
01:03:41,577 --> 01:03:42,893
Other people to save

585
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:45,419
Now, that's a great example of teamwork.

586
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,091
Very well done.
Feel like some music.

587
01:03:51,129 --> 01:03:53,804
Problem solving always puts me
in a musical mood.

588
01:03:58,289 --> 01:03:59,413
Michelle,

589
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:01,795
You should go shower, just in case.

590
01:04:04,946 --> 01:04:05,946
Sure

591
01:04:14,859 --> 01:04:22,859
<font color="#808080">The Exciters - Tell Him</font>

592
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:46,880
I think I might have an idea.

593
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,946
- '10 Better Ways to Style My Bangs'?
- No, not the article. This.

594
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:57,582
I think I can only make one.

595
01:04:57,889 --> 01:04:59,253
But it's a start.

596
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:00,329
No kidding.

597
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:09,409
Hey, Howard

598
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,776
What is this?
You're re-watching '16 Candles'?

599
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,551
'Pretty in Pink'

600
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,457
It was one of Megan's favorite movies.
Can I help you with something?

601
01:05:19,915 --> 01:05:22,982
No, no, I'm just grabbing some water.

602
01:05:57,284 --> 01:05:58,346
Say, ahmm,

603
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,933
You know, I was just thinking..

604
01:06:03,795 --> 01:06:06,253
Not, that I'm trying to tell
you how to run this place.

605
01:06:06,426 --> 01:06:08,084
But I am just,

606
01:06:08,946 --> 01:06:10,333
a bit curious

607
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,529
about Michelle

608
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:17,893
Say, how close do you think
she got to the air filtration unit?

609
01:06:18,062 --> 01:06:19,471
You think she touched it?

610
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:22,778
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.

611
01:06:24,804 --> 01:06:28,746
Yeah, I know she cleaned up after, and
everything.. But I'm just thinking..

612
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:32,875
Given that unit filter has
got god knows what from outside

613
01:06:32,942 --> 01:06:37,520
If she tracked anything back in with
her. It would be pretty concentrated

614
01:06:38,066 --> 01:06:38,789
And

615
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:43,099
Could be all over the shower,
and the sink, bathroom, right now.

616
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:48,099
Well, anyways, it's just a thought.

617
01:08:18,619 --> 01:08:20,622
Not bad so far, partner.

618
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,111
If Howard find this, he's going
to kill us.

619
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,964
Alright, so, we get the gun away from him,

620
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,862
Tie him up, make sure
he isn't going anywhere.

621
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:34,577
And then one of us

622
01:08:34,969 --> 01:08:35,969
just..

623
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,986
Goes out, and looks for help.

624
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:54,795
Ahmm, first word..

625
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,199
Tiny..

626
01:08:58,826 --> 01:09:00,564
Small, pygmie..

627
01:09:01,613 --> 01:09:02,849
- Little.
- Yup.

628
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,639
Alright, ahh

629
01:09:04,795 --> 01:09:05,871
Second word,

630
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:09,360
Michelle, is a..

631
01:09:12,435 --> 01:09:13,435
Ahmm, girl

632
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,266
hmm, a girl, a child

633
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:23,089
ahh, a girl.

634
01:09:23,422 --> 01:09:26,151
No, she's older, so she is a..

635
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:29,560
A little princess?

636
01:09:36,275 --> 01:09:37,333
Ahh, No. It was ..

637
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:39,053
Woman.

638
01:09:39,404 --> 01:09:40,649
'Little Women'..

639
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:43,355
Well,

640
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:44,653
a little woman,

641
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:50,809
Next time,

642
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:52,929
Try to be a little more .. specific.

643
01:10:09,799 --> 01:10:11,431
I'm always watching

644
01:10:12,706 --> 01:10:13,706
Always.

645
01:10:22,902 --> 01:10:23,902
Ahmm, god.

646
01:10:24,555 --> 01:10:26,589
I go wherever I want.

647
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,706
I mean, ah, I don't know.

648
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:34,266
I know what you're doing,
I see what you're doing.

649
01:10:37,853 --> 01:10:40,377
I know what you're up to.

650
01:10:40,609 --> 01:10:43,786
Look, Howard.
I don't know what you're getting at,

651
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:45,920
I see when you're sleeping

652
01:10:45,982 --> 01:10:48,382
- I don't know, what...
- I know what you're doing,

653
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:53,080
- ahh, I don't know..
- And I'm always watching. Always watching.

654
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,711
Santa Claus.
You're Santa Claus.

655
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,991
Yeah, Michelle, that's great.

656
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,737
Okay, except it was Emmett's turn.

657
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:09,040
- Yeah, I got a little excited...
- well, I'm keeping that point.

658
01:11:10,253 --> 01:11:11,760
Totally, you earned it.

659
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:37,259
Emmett?

660
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,009
Hey,

661
01:11:55,169 --> 01:11:57,084
I need your help with something.

662
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,350
Sure.

663
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,764
You. On deck.

664
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,712
What is this?

665
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:31,506
A barrel.

666
01:12:35,186 --> 01:12:36,955
Move it into the bathroom.

667
01:12:47,204 --> 01:12:49,589
This is sulphoric acid.

668
01:12:51,537 --> 01:12:53,364
Do either of you know what that is?

669
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,742
It's usually produced

670
01:12:57,862 --> 01:13:01,066
as a precursor to
ammonium proclorate.

671
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:03,169
Fuel.

672
01:13:04,226 --> 01:13:07,179
Used to launch naval cell
like the ones in North Harvard.

673
01:13:08,709 --> 01:13:10,986
It's highly corrosive.

674
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:18,124
Dissolves most biological
material on contact.

675
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:20,324
With humans,

676
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:23,084
Right down to the bone.

677
01:13:26,213 --> 01:13:27,613
Hey, Howard, ahh..

678
01:13:28,057 --> 01:13:29,986
What're you showing it
to us this for?

679
01:13:33,897 --> 01:13:35,453
You think I'm an idiot?

680
01:13:38,106 --> 01:13:40,786
Howard, please, you're going to have to
tell us what you're talking about.

681
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,297
I'm talking about getting
rid of some waste.

682
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,800
Tell me what you two
were doing with this.

683
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:57,629
You tell me what you two were planning.
Right now!

684
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,480
Take it easy, Calm down.

685
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,629
- Howard, please.
- I'm giving you one chance.

686
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:06,697
Howard, just calm down.

687
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,017
One chance!

688
01:14:08,217 --> 01:14:10,862
To answer with some
dignity or I swear to god

689
01:14:10,889 --> 01:14:13,351
You're going into this barrel
while you're alive to feel it.

690
01:14:13,386 --> 01:14:14,386
It was me.

691
01:14:18,146 --> 01:14:19,879
Alright, not her, It was just me.

692
01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:22,462
- No, no... Stay out of this.
She doesn't have a clue

693
01:14:22,515 --> 01:14:23,560
what she's talking about.

694
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,804
I wanted your gun.

695
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:29,195
And so I was,

696
01:14:29,991 --> 01:14:32,142
Thinking about making a weapon

697
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,431
To get it,

698
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:35,609
From you.

699
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:46,339
I want her to respect me,
the way she respects you.

700
01:14:50,164 --> 01:14:52,049
I'm not saying I was right, okay?

701
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:54,789
And I'm sorry.

702
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:01,937
- You're sorry?
- I am sorry.

703
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,844
I accept your apology.

704
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:27,044
He was going to hurt us.
He was going to hurt you.

705
01:15:27,084 --> 01:15:28,964
It's okay, this is okay.

706
01:15:29,009 --> 01:15:31,493
This is the way it was
always supposed to be.

707
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:32,659
You're safe now.

708
01:15:32,724 --> 01:15:34,659
Now, it's just you and me.

709
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:36,999
It's okay.

710
01:15:38,022 --> 01:15:40,729
Now, you should go to your room now.

711
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:44,339
This is not part of anything
you need to see.

712
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,400
Michelle?

713
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,280
Hey,

714
01:16:46,536 --> 01:16:49,304
I thought we'd change
things up tonight.

715
01:16:49,715 --> 01:16:51,760
And have dessert before dinner.

716
01:16:52,013 --> 01:16:54,551
After all, we can do
whatever we want now.

717
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:03,342
Would you like a cone or a bowl?

718
01:17:06,893 --> 01:17:08,769
Megan always wanted hers a bowl.

719
01:17:08,835 --> 01:17:10,897
The cones are too messy.

720
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:16,459
I know this is not the life you prefer.

721
01:17:17,559 --> 01:17:20,524
And it isn't easy for
you living down here.

722
01:17:21,177 --> 01:17:23,840
But I want us to be a happy family.

723
01:17:24,275 --> 01:17:25,351
You and me.

724
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:30,702
The mess is all taken care of.

725
01:17:31,609 --> 01:17:34,995
So, just hang loose, and
I'll go get dinner started.

726
01:18:40,626 --> 01:18:42,040
Everything alright?

727
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:45,079
Yeah, I was just about to do some reading.

728
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,133
It's time to set the table.

729
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:54,680
Supper is ready.

730
01:18:57,311 --> 01:18:59,724
- Yeah.
- Okay.

731
01:19:11,795 --> 01:19:13,579
Keeps doing that.
I don't know why.

732
01:19:26,902 --> 01:19:29,542
Michelle, Why is this loose?

733
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:34,999
Get up.

734
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:37,262
- Why?
- Get up.

735
01:19:37,457 --> 01:19:39,182
Get off the matress.
Now!

736
01:19:44,684 --> 01:19:45,684
Oh, shit.

737
01:20:09,817 --> 01:20:11,417
You're going to walk out on me?

738
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,039
After I saved you?

739
01:20:16,195 --> 01:20:17,755
And kept you safe?

740
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:19,514
This is how you re-pay me?

741
01:20:22,022 --> 01:20:23,022
No.

742
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,747
This is.

743
01:22:06,073 --> 01:22:07,540
Michelle!

744
01:22:32,854 --> 01:22:35,356
You don't know what's out there.

745
01:22:35,658 --> 01:22:38,364
You can't run from them.

746
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,307
Stay with me.

747
01:28:19,525 --> 01:28:20,874
Come on.

748
01:31:28,396 --> 01:31:30,834
Help! I'm out here, help!

749
01:34:45,094 --> 01:34:46,520
Oh, fuck.

750
01:36:25,078 --> 01:36:28,842
<i>But if you have any medical training
Or combat experience</i>

751
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:30,931
<li>We need help

752
01:36:31,211 --> 01:36:33,433
<i>There are people in Houston.</i>

753
01:36:36,571 --> 01:36:39,104
<i>There are survivors in Mercy Hospital</i>

754
01:36:45,847 --> 01:36:49,024

Who need our help</i>

755

<i>Come join us</i>

756

<i>We've taken back the Southern seaboard</i>

01:36:56,638 --> 01:36:57,851
<i>And we're winning.</i>

758
01:36:58,598 --> 01:37:02,149
<i>If you have any medical training
Or combat experience</i>

759
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,371
<i>There's survivors</i>
