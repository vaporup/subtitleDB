1
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,674
<i>Let me tell you about my day so far.</i>

2
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,676
<i>Coffee in Paris,
surfed the Maldives...</i>

3
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,178
<i>took a little nap
on Mount Kilimanjaro.</i>

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,181
<i>Oh, yeah, and I got digits
from this Polish chick in Rio.</i>

5
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,183
<i>And then I jumped back...</i>

6
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,027
<i>for the final quarter
of the N.B.A. finals...</i>

7
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:54,913
<i>courtside, of course.</i>

8
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,921
<i>And all that was before lunch.</i>

9
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,923
<i>I could go on,
but all I'm saying is...</i>

10
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,993
<i>I'm standing on top of the world.</i>

11
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,364
The lighter terrain here...

12
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,196
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

13
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,329
<i>Once I was a normal person,
a chump just like you.</i>

14
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,577
- Hey, Millie.
- Oh, hey, David.

15
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,240
You got a lot of cities there.

16
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,320
<i>Well, if you're gonna have a dream,
might as well dream big, right?</i>

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,320
<i>Right.</i>

18
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,322
See you later.

19
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,000
Hey, Millie.

20
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,065
Give me a sec.
Hey.

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,835
I wanted to give you this.

22
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,105
I picked it up at a
yard sale in Plymouth.

23
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,182
I- I thought you'd really like it.

24
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,585
It's a little dinged up
and it's missing a few steps, but...

25
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,489
I love it.

26
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,120
- You do?
- I do.

27
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,755
<i>Holy crap, Rice Bowl!</i>

28
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,699
- Mark.
- Hey, what's this?

29
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,702
- Christmas come early?
- Mark, stop it.

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,931
<i>- Mark, give it back to her.
- Holy crap!</i>

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,032
Look what David got Millie!
You guys like the Eiffel Tower?

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,051
Wow, if you shake this
thing hard enough,

33
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:26,772
you can hear the Eiffel Tower move.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,179
- Hey, who wants to give it a shake?
- Okay, that's enough!

35
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,649
- Stop it. Just give it back.
- All right.

36
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,720
Okay, I'm sorry.
Here.

37
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,492
Sorry, buddy.
Guess I don't know my own strength.

38
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,631
- I can't believe you're such a jerk!
- I was just playing around.

39
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,574
<i>- It wasn't funny.</i>

40
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,796
They thought
it was pretty funny.

41
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,932
<i>David?</i>

42
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,738
David, don't go out there.
It's not safe.

43
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,745
David, just forget about it.

44
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,179
Come on, Rice Bowl!
Don't be stupid!

45
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,616
David, come back. Come on.
Just let it go. It's okay!

46
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,120
<i>Stop! It's not worth it.
Just come back. Please?</i>

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,021
Come on, David!

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,430
<i>Be careful. Come on.</i>

49
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,864
<i>- All good. See?
- Great. Now come back.</i>

50
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,771
- David!
- Millie, don't go out there!

51
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,277
<i>David! David! Somebody...</i>

52
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,779
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

53
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,942
- David... Get help!
- Millie, get back here!

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,919
<i>Please help! David!</i>

55
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,751
<i>- Call 911! David!
- You can't help him!</i>

56
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,587
<i>- Millie, stop, stop, stop!
- David!</i>

57
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:12,918
<i>And that's how it
happened the first time.</i>

58
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,257
<i>One second I'm a goner,
and the next thing</i>

59
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:17,649
<i>I know I'm at the Ann
Arbor Public Library.</i>

60
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,265
<i>Home, sweet home.</i>

61
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,969
<i>Mom left when I was five.</i>

62
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:42,036
<i>As for Dad, well, let's just say
he wasn't much of one.</i>

63
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,453
<i>You're late.
Supper's cold.</i>

64
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,721
<i>Where you been, anyway?</i>

65
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,832
You know, when I ask a question,
I expect an answer. Okay?

66
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,095
Hey, hey, hey.
What happened to you?

67
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,171
Just kids at school.

68
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:12,006
Hey, David, get back down here,
get a mop and clean this crap up!

69
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,011
<i>David!</i>

70
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,206
<i>Don't make me come up there!</i>

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,807
<i>David?
Make the right choice!</i>

72
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,012
<i>David! David.</i>

73
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,180
Open the door.

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,277
Did I just teleport?

75
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,186
Great.

76
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,720
I teleported to the library.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,371
<i>Look... No, no, no.
I'm not going anywhere.</i>

78
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,054
<i>I don't care what you say.</i>

79
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,854
<i>And that's when it occurred to me.</i>

80
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,419
<i>This thing that just happened,
it could set me free.</i>

81
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,309
<i>And if she could run away,
so could I.</i>

82
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,282
You're okay.

83
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,718
<i>I wanted to tell her everything.</i>

84
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,797
David?

85
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,132
David?

86
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,862
<i>I mean, who would have
believed me anyway?</i>

87
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,902
<i>David!</i>

88
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,974
<i>I figured it was time to move on.</i>

89
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,103
Uh, I'd like a room.

90
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,536
You're not gonna be any trouble,
are you? No weird stuff?

91
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,337
Nope.
No weird stuff.

92
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,263
<i>And so there I was.</i>

93
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,028
<i>I had a million questions,
like how does this thing work?</i>

94
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,103
<i>How do I control it?</i>

95
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,277
Been there.

96
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,355
<i>Mommy, you can see
the ocean and everything!</i>

97
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,016
If we're lucky,
maybe we'll see King Kong.

98
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,025
Really?

99
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,563
- You got me?
- Oh, I got you. I'm not letting you go.

100
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,586
<i>I was 15.</i>

101
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,218
<i>Come on.
What would you have done?</i>

102
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,297
<i>I figured I'd pay it back someday.</i>

103
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,239
Is there a bathroom for customers?

104
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,581
Hey.
It's this way.

105
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,655
Yeah.

106
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,757
Make it quick.

107
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,986
No problem.
Thanks.

108
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,896
I'm gonna need a bigger bag.

109
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:57,276
<i># Hey, I'm not all alone #</i>

110
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,413
<i># Hey, you can tag along #</i>

111
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,890
<i># 'Cause I have
done it before #</i>

112
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,894
<i># And I can do it some more #</i>

113
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,725
<i># I got my eye on the score #</i>

114
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,493
<i># I'm gonna crash through the door
It's too late #</i>

115
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,568
Holy shit.

116
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,637
Whoo!

117
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,774
<i>Hey!</i>

118
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,313
I said no weird stuff.

119
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:28,336
Let's go... two days'
rent. You owe me rent.

120
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,347
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

121
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,168
The police and the F.B.I.
Have already been through here.

122
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,795
- Who are you with?
- N.S.A.

123
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,306
<i>They couldn't make
heads or tails of it.</i>

124
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,810
The vault has a time lock,
pressure mounts, steel plates.

125
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,812
- This guy didn't open a door.
- Open a door?

126
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,815
We didn't know we were robbed
until halfway through the day.

127
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,283
I want the security tapes
for the whole month.

128
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:11,288
And I need the name of everyone who has
a safety deposit box in that vault.

129
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,382
That's confidential.
Why do you need those names?

130
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,894
Whoever robbed your vault
has been in it before.

131
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,057
Now, I want those names,
and I want those tapes.

132
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,067
Today.

133
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,515
<i>So the story had a happy ending.</i>

134
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,318
<i>Rice Bowl was dead,
but I had never been more alive.</i>

135
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,827
<i>So now I'm living in New York.</i>

136
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,329
<i>But why settle in one place...</i>

137
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,729
<i>when you can have the whole world?</i>

138
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,237
<i># I was hip to the beat
on city streets #</i>

139
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,466
<i># I saw a signpost tellin'me
to pick my feet...</i>

140
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:04,105
<i>off the ground, y'all #</i>

141
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,004
<i># Said "I think"
to the shrink #</i>

142
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,640
<i># I tell her
well, 'bout my lover #</i>

143
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:15,084
<i># She tell me, "Get a dog
that says bow-wow-wow"#</i>

144
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,451
She floats into the river.

145
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,051
But as you can see, this flood became
more severe about 10 minutes ago.

146
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,291
The question now, Pat, is,
what will happen to these people?

147
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,492
<i>It would take a miracle
to get to them.</i>

148
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,821
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.</i>

149
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,661
- How they doin'?
- Down by six at the half.

150
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,668
Don't think you'll be
needing that umbrella.

151
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,000
You never know.

152
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,084
<i>- Watch it!
- You mind if I join you?</i>

153
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,814
<i>- No.
- What are you drinking?</i>

154
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,651
Gin and tonic.

155
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:03,091
Uh, Tanqueray and tonic.
Two of'em, please.

156
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,957
So, you live in London?

157
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,060
<i># We lay down the law #</i>

158
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,696
<i>- Taxi!
- # So what the hell are you here for #</i>

159
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,968
<i># We lay down the law #</i>

160
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,544
<i># So what you need me for #</i>

161
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,498
Shit.

162
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,079
Dude, this totally sucks.

163
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,615
Hey, I thought this was where the storm
was supposed to hit.

164
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,379
- I heard it hit Fiji.
- Fiji, huh?

165
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,251
Yeah. They got,
like, 30-foot swells.

166
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,017
Really?

167
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,631
Wh... Whoa!

168
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,179
Let's go.

169
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:19,522
<i>¿Por qué?
¿Por qué? Why?</i>

170
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,328
Because you are an abomination.

171
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,532
Only God should have the power...

172
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,405
to be all places at all times.

173
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,700
One less of you to worry about.

174
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,765
Cut him down!

175
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,501
Let's get the hell out of here.

176
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,804
<i>Yeah?</i>

177
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,812
We have a lead on the bank, sir.

178
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,439
I'll be on the next plane.

179
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,223
Hey, Angelo.
How'd they do?

180
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,225
- Not so good.
- Ah.

181
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,048
- Told you you wouldn't
be needing that umbrella.

182
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:26,286
Yeah. You were right.

183
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,410
<i>Don't run.</i>

184
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,890
Eight years
we've been looking for you.

185
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,125
And who are you?

186
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,198
My name's Roland.

187
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,626
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- Oh, we'll get to that.

188
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,306
What kind of crook...

189
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,378
leaves a note?

190
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,216
<i>- I think I need to talk to my lawyers.
- Why?</i>

191
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,047
You're not under arrest.

192
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,213
- You mean you're not the...
- Police? Mm-mmm.

193
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,223
Anybody can rob a bank.

194
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,506
What I'd like to know is
how you rob a bank...

195
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:29,817
without opening any doors.

196
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,828
<i>Come on.</i>

197
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,831
<i>I'm sure you can think of something.</i>

198
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,834
Look, uh,
if you're not the police...

199
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,633
and I'm not under arrest...

200
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,269
I think I'd like you to leave.

201
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,314
You need some help with that?

202
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,887
Been a while
since you used a door, huh?

203
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,960
Oh, I know who you are.

204
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,757
<i>And I know what you are.</i>

205
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,966
This conversation's over...

206
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,366
This conversation's not over...

207
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,371
until you answer my question!

208
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,806
Tell me, how'd you
last this long? Huh?

209
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,746
<i>Who's helping you?</i>

210
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,387
Jumpers.

211
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,385
<i>Kinda hard to jump with 1,000 volts of...</i>

212
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:40,661
<i>electricity passing
through your brain, huh?</i>

213
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,861
Perfect!

214
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:51,109
Who's protecting you?
Give me an answer so I can go home.

215
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,303
I hate Jumpers.

216
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,290
You think you could
go on like this forever...

217
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:12,830
<i>living like this
with no consequences? Hmm?</i>

218
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,134
There are always consequences.

219
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:25,603
Where you goin', huh?
I've got you now.

220
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,777
<i>You think you can hide behind a wall,
go anywhere, do anything?</i>

221
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,119
<i>Not anymore!</i>

222
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,534
Currently 66 degrees in...

223
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,003
David? David!

224
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,136
<i>That you?</i>

225
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,373
David! David!
Don't go!

226
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,383
Don't go. Just... Just...
Just hear me out.

227
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,510
Okay?

228
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,520
David...

229
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:14,649
I- I don't know if
I'm going crazy here or not.

230
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,059
I don't know a lot of things these days,
but if you can hear me...

231
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,155
Just wait, David! Don't go!
I gotta talk to ya!

232
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,767
David, if you can hear me, Son...

233
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,806
it's okay.

234
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,875
You can come home...

235
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,944
<i>anytime you want.</i>

236
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,408
You're not crazy.

237
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,587
- Telecommunications.
- This is Roland.

238
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,628
He got away.

239
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,130
We have his jump sites.

240
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,196
<i>I want everybody up and running.</i>

241
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,203
Everybody.

242
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:04,264
<i>Picking up transmission.</i>

243
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,658
Who is this?

244
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,981
May I help you?

245
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,608
Yeah, uh...

246
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,155
Hi, Mrs. Harris.
It's me, David.

247
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,282
David?
David Rice?

248
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,485
Millie was right.
You're not...

249
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,154
Dead. Yeah.
No, I'm not.

250
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,760
Actually, I was hoping
you could tell me where to find Millie.

251
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,236
Millie. She's got her own place
over on Morton.

252
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,239
Number 260.

253
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,400
- She's still here?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

254
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,707
She works at Houlihan's Bar
down by the campus.

255
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,813
<i>That's it!</i>

256
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,715
<i>Announcer]
He's carried the ball 20 times.</i>

257
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,850
<i>Millie, need those pitchers.</i>

258
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,054
<i>Announcer Continues]
- [Cheering, Chattering Continue]</i>

259
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,970
Okay, you saw her.

260
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,106
Holy crap!
Rice Bowl?

261
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,709
Mark!
Mark Kobold!

262
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,220
Sorry, man.
I don't know you.

263
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,349
Jesus Christ!
Am I seeing a ghost?

264
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,825
Is this some kind of
sixth-sense shit?

265
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,897
I don't know what you're
talking about. Okay?

266
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,124
Hey! Everybody!
It's Rice Bowl!

267
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,796
Come on, don't you wanna grab a beer
with an old buddy from high school?

268
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,567
<i>- I'm not this David...
- David?</i>

269
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,277
Yo, it's the Rice Cake.

270
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,676
- Millie?
- Hi!

271
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,048
You were gonna leave
without saying anything?

272
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,053
Uh...

273
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,749
- Sorry. I didn't see you.
- No?

274
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,986
Weren't you just up there
staring at me for the past 45 minutes?

275
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,797
Yeah, David.
Why didn't you say somethin'?

276
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,198
- I think you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk. Okay? I'm cool.

277
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,100
I am totally, 110% cool.

278
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,169
Yeah, that was really
cool. Why don't you...

279
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,005
go find a bench and sleep it off. Okay?

280
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,840
<i>Why don't you go make me
a drink, sweetheart? Huh?</i>

281
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,607
A little splash of that.

282
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,080
Hey! No!

283
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,845
<i>Fight! Come on! Fight!</i>

284
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,319
Come on.

285
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,790
<i>- Mark!
- Come on, man!</i>

286
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,860
<i>- Stop it, you guys!
- Yeah!</i>

287
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,328
Rice Bowl goes down!
Whoo!

288
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,535
Whoo!

289
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,334
Wh-What did you do to me?

290
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,414
Freak!

291
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,047
Guess I don't know my own strength.

292
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,656
Hey, wh...

293
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,565
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Hey.

294
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,570
Yeah.

295
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,163
Where's Mark?

296
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,505
- He took off.
- What?

297
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:36,047
Yeah, I don't think, uh, he's gonna
come back anytime soon.

298
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,411
Oh.

299
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,880
Bleeding a little.

300
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,390
We should take care of that.

301
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,460
Come on.

302
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,609
So, you saw me as soon as I came in?

303
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,679
Maybe.

304
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,750
I didn't know what to say.

305
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:18,312
How about, "Hi. Hello.
Been a long time. How are you?"

306
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,561
- Hi.
- Hello.

307
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,257
- Been a long time. How are you?
- I'm good.

308
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,265
How are you?

309
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,063
Why don't we skip this boring stuff?

310
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,037
You know, I didn't think,
uh, you'd still be here.

311
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,043
Where else would I be?

312
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,045
You had those lists, right?

313
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,275
And you were gonna
go travel the world and...

314
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,815
Things change.
We all need to grow up, right?

315
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,257
So what do you do?

316
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,120
Banking.
I'm in banking.

317
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,925
In banking?
How'd you get into that?

318
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,832
It's pretty easy, actually.
I just sort of landed in it.

319
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,301
Didn't you flunk algebra?

320
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,167
No.

321
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,244
- Fiona, I'm gonna take my break now.
- Yeah, sure. You bet.

322
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,574
<i>So, you're back.</i>

323
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,652
What now?
What's your plan?

324
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,946
Maybe gonna do some traveling.

325
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,358
I was thinking of maybe
checking out Rome, actually.

326
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,635
You were thinking
of checking out Rome?

327
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,706
You know that was my dream.
Don't try to rip me off. Okay?

328
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,009
- So come with me.
- So come with you?

329
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,309
- You're asking me to go to Rome?
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,976
I mean, only if you want to
skip the boring parts.

331
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,721
I got it.
I'll take it!

332
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,521
<i>- Thank you.
- As you like.</i>

333
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,095
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:43,256
Can you believe just 10 hours ago
we were in Ann Arbor?

335
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,302
Yeah.

336
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,836
<i>What does the C.I.A. Want with this?</i>

337
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,339
I'm afraid that's classified.

338
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,341
Really?

339
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,776
Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to see a federal warrant.

340
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,348
'Cause I don't believe you are
who you say you are.

341
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,110
Certainly.

342
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,129
Great.
Another cop.

343
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,637
So, Mark, tell me
what happened at the bank.

344
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,642
I told them already.

345
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,804
You're just another suit.
You're never gonna believe me.

346
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,718
It says here you were
beamed into the vault.

347
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:43,091
You wanna laugh about it?
Go ahead. Have a laugh.

348
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,295
You hear me laughing?

349
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,800
The girl's name is Millie Harris.

350
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,665
She boarded a plane
to Rome 16 hours ago,

351
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,362
and she didn't go alone.

352
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,289
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

353
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:21,858
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

354
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,863
What do you mean?

355
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,939
This room.

356
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,009
First class.

357
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,778
<i>Usually in my life,
when things seem too good to be true...</i>

358
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,781
it's because they are.

359
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,852
- I told you, I'm in banki...
- Banking?

360
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,657
<i>See, I know
that you flunked algebra.</i>

361
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,526
<i>If you don't wanna
tell me everything, that's fine.</i>

362
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,456
But just don't lie to me.

363
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,169
I'm not lying to you.

364
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,239
No?

365
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,149
Good.

366
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,634
Can't... reach it.

367
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,665
<i># If I don't say this now #</i>

368
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,765
<i># I will surely break #</i>

369
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,777
<i># As I'm meeting the world #</i>

370
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,006
<i># I wanna say #</i>

371
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,141
<i># Forget the urgency #</i>

372
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,186
<i># But hurry up and wait #</i>

373
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,983
<i># My heart has started #</i>

374
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,720
<i># To separate #</i>

375
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,922
<i># Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh #</i>

376
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,023
<i># Please, baby #</i>

377
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:07,298
<i># Oh-ohh, ohh-ohh #</i>

378
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,336
<i># Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh #</i>

379
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,638
<i># Please, baby #</i>

380
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:19,206
<i># I'll look after you #</i>

381
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,547
I could eat.

382
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,298
<i>You know, you could've just</i>

383
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:25,790
asked me out on a date.

384
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,915
<i># So few come and go, girl #</i>

385
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,187
<i># Will you, won't you #</i>

386
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,320
<i># Be the one
I'll always know #</i>

387
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,491
<i># When I'm losing my control #</i>

388
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,365
<i>- Grazie.
- # This head spins around #</i>

389
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,200
<i># You're the only one
who knows #</i>

390
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,106
<i># This slowing sound #</i>

391
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,111
<i># Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh #</i>

392
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,714
<i>You know, this has always been</i>

393
00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:52,984
number one on my list.

394
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,984
I know.

395
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,214
You must be pretty good
at this, huh?

396
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,291
Good at what?

397
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,758
<i># Please, baby #</i>

398
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:09,299
<i># I'll look after you #</i>

399
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,800
<i>- # Baby #
- Rookie.</i>

400
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,498
<i>- # Oh-ohh, ohh-ohh #
- No idea.</i>

401
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,337
<i>Whoa-whoa-whoa!</i>

402
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,343
- W-W-W-W-Wait!
- Sorry, sir.

403
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:23,017
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
No. No. It's impossible.

404
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:23,346
What?

405
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:24,307
- It's closed.

406
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:27,475
What do you mean, it's
closed? How is it closed?

407
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:31,453
- We just wanna go inside there.
- No, it's impossible. No, no.

408
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,184
- It's the Colosseum. How is it closed?
- It's impossible.

409
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,086
<i>David, it's okay. I got
to see it from outside.</i>

410
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:38,285
<i>That's good enough.</i>

411
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:41,376
- You know, she came all
this way to go inside.

412
00:36:41,476 --> 00:36:42,264
Hey, come on.

413
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,300
Sorry, he's... I don't know.

414
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,370
<i>- Ciao.
- Bye.</i>

415
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,709
<i>Millie!</i>

416
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,870
<i>- Come on.
- What?</i>

417
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,005
Come on.
How about a private tour?

418
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:01,176
It's closed. We can't
break into the Colosseum.

419
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,743
Who said it's closed?
The door was open.

420
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,824
Wanna see the Colosseum or not?

421
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,061
Come on.

422
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,630
We so should not be doing this.

423
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,124
<i>This place is amazing.</i>

424
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,215
<i>I wanted you to see this.</i>

425
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,124
You've gotta admit,
it's worth the risk.

426
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:48,132
Yeah.

427
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,539
- It's so cool!
- It is.

428
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:06,710
Down here is where they used to keep
the gladiators and the lions in cages?

429
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,378
- We should go down there.
- Can't go down there. It's off-limits.

430
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,082
- Even when it's open.
- Nothing's off-limits.

431
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,954
What?

432
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,459
Psst! Millie!

433
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,398
Did that door just open too?

434
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,439
- It's open now.
- Yeah.

435
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,306
You're gonna want to see this.
Trust me.

436
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,993
<i>Bet you that's worth something.</i>

437
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,392
<i>Maybe.</i>

438
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:02,265
Uh-oh.

439
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,500
I think he's telling you
do not enter.

440
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,705
You speak Italian?

441
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,713
No.

442
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,715
<i>- Well, uh, I'ingresso...
- Uh-huh?</i>

443
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,717
Means "come on in. "

444
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,050
Oh! I thought it meant "bullshit. "

445
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,056
Well, no, that means that you should
stay here while I go around...

446
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,558
and open it from the other side.

447
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,561
It's all right.
You'll catch on.

448
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,631
Mmm.

449
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,838
Thank you very much.
Next showing will be at 6:00.

450
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,007
Don't forget to tip your usher.

451
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,749
<i>- Oh, uh...
- Uh, do you mind, man?</i>

452
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,414
- Whoa!
- Just a little privacy, eh?

453
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,081
<i>- Sorry, man.
- Big Colosseum. Guy peein'?</i>

454
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,649
This isn't a fashion show.
I'm taking a piss. Do you mind?

455
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,490
Place is all yours.

456
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,441
Wouldn't open that door if I were you,

457
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,834
not if I wanted my girlfriend
to keep breathing.

458
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,286
<i>What are you gonna do anyway?</i>

459
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:13,501
<i>Bring her down, have a
nice, romantic picnic?</i>

460
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,512
Nice little tea party?
Is that what you think is gonna happen?

461
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,378
- If you so much as look at her wrong...
- You gonna jump me? Where?

462
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,688
Did you think you were the only one?

463
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,282
You really have no idea, do you?

464
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,292
You lead the life you live.

465
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,227
<i>You think you can just go on a little
Roman holiday and they wouldn't notice?</i>

466
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,231
Just jump
all over the place...

467
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,233
jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump...

468
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,303
and nothing's gonna happen?

469
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,071
Well, they've noticed.

470
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,801
Not me.

471
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,571
I mean I already knew.
I'm not talking about me, but them.

472
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,646
Down there.

473
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,985
Hello, boys.

474
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,390
Just me, then.

475
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,949
Huh. That's new.

476
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,141
Welcome to the war.

477
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,255
Just let me know if you guys
are gettin' tired.

478
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,262
- Close.
- David?

479
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,267
What's going on?

480
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,099
Great. Let's meet
the girlfriend, shall we?

481
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,267
No.

482
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,223
Who are these people?

483
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,225
Paladins.
Paladins killJumpers.

484
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,124
I kill Paladins.
Class dismissed.

485
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,136
<i>Polizia! Polizia!</i>

486
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,898
<i>- Polizia!
- Uh-oh.</i>

487
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,471
Wait!

488
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,709
I just came through your jump scar.

489
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,720
What do you think
you're doing here? Huh?

490
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,222
If I were you, I'd jump right back.

491
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,054
You're not supposed to see
all this stuff. Get out!

492
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:49,828
So if you'd like to
kindly fuck off, as in now.

493
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,368
Maybe your girlfriend's still alive.

494
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,268
- Hey.
- Hey.

495
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,934
- What happened to you?
- Uh, nothing.

496
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,173
Let's go. Come on.
I think we should just get out of here.

497
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,511
<i>That didn't sound like nothing.</i>

498
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:10,348
You were right. Okay? I shouldn't have
gone down there. Everything's fine.

499
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,446
Come on. We can
still make the museum.

500
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,863
<i>David?</i>

501
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,865
<i>Will you talk to me?
Please?</i>

502
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,867
Must be a cab around here somewhere.

503
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,369
Why aren't you talking to me?
Please talk to me.

504
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,562
- I'll tell you everything
back at the hotel. Okay?

505
00:43:29,662 --> 00:43:30,872
I'm not waiting for the hotel.

506
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,141
- Look, Millie, it's,
uh... it's all fine. Okay?

507
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:34,206
No, it's not all fine.

508
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,576
<i>I wasn't supposed to go back there.</i>

509
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,878
Huh?

510
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,885
<i>Uh, no comprende.</i>

511
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,751
No, I think you guys made a mistake.

512
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:46,362
- Be quiet.

513
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:48,381
You're looking for that guy over there.

514
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,945
I'm sorry. I know I wasn't

515
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,663
supposed to be back there.

516
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,892
<i>Calma, calma, calma, calma.</i>

517
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,834
Can't you just let us
off with a warning...

518
00:43:58,934 --> 00:43:59,629
Whoa! Okay, okay.

519
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,967
Okay, okay, okay.

520
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,787
- Millie, just go back
to the hotel. Okay?

521
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:05,166
No...

522
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,245
<i>- No, no, we're not together.
- I'm with him!</i>

523
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,643
I don't know her.
Millie, go back to the hotel.

524
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,149
No. No.

525
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,084
I told you.
I want to see Millie.

526
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,454
- Where is the body?
- I didn't do anything, okay?

527
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,586
I- I don't know how many times
you want me to tell you the same thing.

528
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,928
Do you know how much longer
he's gonna be back there?

529
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,004
<i>We wait for magistrato.</i>

530
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,130
<i>Yeah. I know. We've been waiting for
a magistrato all night.</i>

531
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,842
I don't speak your...
I don't know what you're saying.

532
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,007
Now you "seat," or we seat you.

533
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,107
- Okay.
- Seat!

534
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,345
I seat.

535
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,889
<i>- She's got
nothing to do with this.</i>

536
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,824
<i>Allora, the magistrate is here.
We will hold on to your passport.</i>

537
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:04,025
<i>Don't worry.
You won't need it where you're going.</i>

538
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,339
Hello, David.

539
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,088
<i>You've only got about 30 seconds before...</i>

540
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:21,907
<i>they come through that
door. You understand?</i>

541
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,987
You have to get out of here.

542
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,558
- Ditch the girl. If she's
with you, she's dead.

543
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:26,818
<i>Mom.</i>

544
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,825
- Mom.
- Twenty seconds, David.

545
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:35,264
Mom! Mom!

546
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,390
Hey!

547
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,681
Millie.

548
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,747
All done. You okay?

549
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,821
Mm-hmm. Hey.

550
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,719
- I'm free to walk.
- They just let you go?

551
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,657
- They just let me go.
- Just like that?

552
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,423
Just like that.
Come on.

553
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,631
If they just let you go,
why are we running?

554
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,464
Well, uh, they really strongly suggested
that we leave town now.

555
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,869
- But what did they say to you?
- Asked me some questions.

556
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,034
- For eight hours?
- They had a lot of questions.

557
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,578
I really want to trust you.
You're making it extremely difficult.

558
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,580
All right. So trust me.
Let's go.

559
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,919
Whoa!

560
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,055
Whoa! Hey.

561
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,955
<i>Can you take us? Yeah?</i>

562
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,257
Get in the cab, Millie.
Millie, get in the car.

563
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,425
Please.
Please get in the cab.

564
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,895
<i>That's yours.</i>

565
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,465
Remember how I told you you didn't
need to tell me everything?

566
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,803
I changed my mind.

567
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,876
What's in the backpack?

568
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,002
Where did you get that?

569
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,270
I don't want to lie to you.

570
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,513
But you don't want to
tell me the truth either.

571
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,316
I can't get on this flight
with you, Millie.

572
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,586
<i>This is as far as we go together.</i>

573
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,808
<i>- To Detroit?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

574
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,880
<i>Roland.</i>

575
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,956
We lost him, sir.

576
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,059
- How many did you send?
- Two men.

577
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,152
- I told you to send everybody.
- Well, she said two would be enough...

578
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,197
but, uh, they missed him.

579
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,961
It's like he knew we were coming.

580
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,866
We're searching the grid now.

581
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:04,702
Keep me informed.
I'm taking a different tack.

582
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,089
William Rice?

583
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,680
Yeah.

584
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,760
I.R.S.

585
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:28,361
Could we, uh, go inside and talk?

586
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,332
I don't have to ask.
That's a courtesy.

587
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,668
<i>So, what's this all about?</i>

588
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,934
Your son. David.

589
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,005
Why? Is he in some kind
of trouble or something?

590
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:50,216
This will go a lot swifter
if you let me ask the questions.

591
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,221
When's the last time
you saw your son?

592
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,792
Eight years ago.

593
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,264
Eight years?

594
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,333
That's right.

595
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,968
What about friends?

596
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,971
Anybody I can talk to?

597
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,268
He didn't have
a whole lot of friends.

598
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,038
I'd like to talk to
David's mother if I could.

599
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:19,206
Yeah, me too.
If you find her, tell her I said hello.

600
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,284
That her?

601
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,546
Mary Rice. At least that was
her name back then.

602
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,391
When's the last time you saw her?

603
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,962
She split when the kid turned five.

604
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,963
Five. Oh.

605
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,158
<i>Haven't heard a word since.</i>

606
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,735
If I hear anything,
I'll be sure to give you a holler.

607
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,941
- No, you won't.
- No. I won't.

608
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,782
Have you seen the special move
you can do on this new thing?

609
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,816
They've added this
new control and, like,

610
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:05,419
you just... If you... Just
double-click it. See that?

611
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,429
What do you say?
Whoa.

612
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,001
Still alive, are ya?

613
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,162
<i>Video Game
Machine Gun Fire]</i>

614
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,504
<i>- I'm hit!
- He's dead.</i>

615
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,545
- What? That's just great.
- There's more of them?

616
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,759
<i>Hundreds more. I'm
tracking 10 right now.</i>

617
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,708
<i>What do you care? There's lots more.</i>

618
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,548
- What about the rest?
- What about the rest?

619
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,713
Like I said, I hunt them.

620
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,791
<i>- Start again.
- So who are these guys?</i>

621
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,620
I told you.
They're Paladins.

622
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:40,322
Yeah, you told me their name.
You didn't tell me what they want.

623
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,651
<i>Well, it's pretty simple,</i>

624
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:43,901
isn't it? They want us dead.

625
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:47,129
- Didn't you figure that out yet?
- Yeah. No, I got that much.

626
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,137
- Good. I'm glad.
- Yeah. Thanks.

627
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,173
- Do you mind just, uh...
- Why?

628
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,174
Because we can do
whatever the hell we want.

629
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,176
- Now can you please just...
- I'm hit!

630
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,577
- He's dead.
- Great. Thanks.

631
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,912
You really don't get it, do you?

632
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:04,010
Paladins have been killing
Jumpers for years.

633
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,021
Way back since medieval times.

634
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,417
They're fanatics.
Religious nut jobs.

635
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,256
Inquisition. Witch hunts.
That was them.

636
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:16,321
Look. They're smart.
They're fast. They're organized.

637
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,867
No matter what, they'll kill anyone
that gets in their way.

638
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,769
Like your family.
Your friends.

639
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:26,604
That little girlfriend
you're traipsing around Rome with you.

640
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,942
They're dead.
All of'em.

641
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:33,642
Get used to it.
It's just a matter of time.

642
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,548
I'm gonna get some takeaway.
Do you want some?

643
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,150
He's your father.

644
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,317
I'm sorry. I talked to him,
but he wouldn't budge.

645
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:18,553
<i>He can be so stubborn.</i>

646
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,954
<i>I don't know how my
mother puts up with him.</i>

647
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,305
Somebody get some help!

648
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,243
<i>- Now!
- What happened?</i>

649
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,751
<i>What's going on in here?</i>

650
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,419
<i>Get the paddles.</i>

651
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,794
You okay? Stay still.

652
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,368
<i>I'm not getting a pulse.</i>

653
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,040
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

654
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,010
Oh!

655
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,843
<i>Mark.</i>

656
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:14,382
- Jesus Christ.
- What did you tell him?

657
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,475
- How did they know about Ann Arbor?
- Don't touch me.

658
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,248
- Who'd you tell?
- Stay the hell away from me.

659
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:22,382
Was it a black guy with white hair?
Was his name Roland?

660
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,392
Just answer the question...

661
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,689
or I'll drop you off the top
of Mount Everest, okay?

662
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,696
- What? What?
- What did you tell him?

663
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,130
I don't... What? Tell what?

664
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:33,134
I know you told him
about home, all right?

665
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:36,103
I know you told him about Ann Arbor.
Did you tell him about Millie?

666
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,867
I told him everything.

667
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,204
Why?
Why did you do that?

668
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,608
Why not?

669
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,646
<i>Who are you?</i>

670
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,481
Whoa! Whew!

671
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,490
Where'd the Paladin go?

672
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,060
- Swimming.
- Pacific?

673
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:01,756
No. Actually, Atlantic.
Nice little shark pit round Cuba.

674
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,763
<i>Uh, what do you think you're doing?</i>

675
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:06,695
- Put that stuff back!

676
00:55:06,795 --> 00:55:08,337
Actually, I need to borrow a few things.

677
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,770
Just stay away from the wall!

678
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,341
I'll cut your eyes out.

679
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,876
I need to find Roland.

680
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,310
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

681
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,473
- I only got eight hours.
- Eight hours?

682
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,517
There's a girl...
Her flight lands in eight hours.

683
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,415
Think that stuff's gonna help?
That stuff's four years old.

684
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,284
<i>Do you want me to jump you back to
high school so you can learn something?</i>

685
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,290
I've been tracking him for 10 years.
Look at this. Look.

686
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,759
You see this?
Our first round in Nepal.

687
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,094
You should see the one he gave me
back in Prague.

688
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,964
Look. Forget it.
Forget Roland.

689
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,038
Don't waste your time.

690
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,197
Just leave it to me.

691
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,287
- Do you mind?
- Look.

692
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,481
Little, uh... Little privacy here?

693
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,990
You know, this is
kind of my thing. Just...

694
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:06,688
Just... Get... You know, turn around.

695
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,764
Yeah.

696
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:13,165
I'm... I was thinking
that if we do this together...

697
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,170
we could get him.

698
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:17,365
What? You mean, like, you and me?

699
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,999
<i>- Yeah.
- Like we team up?</i>

700
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,772
Yeah.

701
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,370
Look. I'm sorry,
but I don't play well with others.

702
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:44,790
<i>Do me a favor, yeah?
Don't be here when I get back.</i>

703
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,563
Find a rock. Crawl under it.
Stay there.

704
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,637
<i>Joi woo, brother.</i>

705
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,216
That's "good-bye" in Chinese.

706
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,227
Yeah. No. I've been meaning to call.

707
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:31,109
Really. I still really
want to get the tattoo.

708
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,884
You can't keep following me.

709
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,715
<i>Actually...
I'm the one person who can.</i>

710
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,721
Yeah, lucky me.

711
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,301
Why are you walking?

712
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:32,705
I mean, I... I know Tokyo pretty well.
I got a lot of jump sites here.

713
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,009
You know, I-I... I like
walking for a change.

714
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:37,576
Makes me feel normal.

715
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,808
You, uh... You ever read
Marvel Team-up?

716
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,817
Yeah, I read it. And?

717
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:47,618
Two superheroes joining forces
for, like, uh, a limited run.

718
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,693
I see what you're trying to do, yeah?
I'm not buying it.

719
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:54,195
For your own sake, just go home.

720
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,095
- You live in a cave.
- It's called a lair.

721
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,168
And what's the point?

722
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:03,365
I'm just saying, you know.
We, uh, kind of have this common thing.

723
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,699
And I know where to find Roland.

724
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,223
So we doing this, or what?

725
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,071
<i>Whoo!</i>

726
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,443
Sorry. Clutch stuck.

727
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:53,251
- You're real subtle.

728
00:59:53,351 --> 00:59:55,280
Yeah, I'm not gonna
get rid of you, am I?

729
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,335
Whoa. Whoa.

730
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,741
You might want to hold on, son.

731
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,322
That was close.

732
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,092
Not bad.

733
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,397
This thing must be two tons, easy.
How are you, uh...

734
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,801
If it moves, I can jump it.

735
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:46,205
<i>Actually, I knew this Jumper once...
crazy bastard...</i>

736
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,573
tried to hop a whole building.

737
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:51,112
- Won't be trying that again.
- Why's that?

738
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,705
That's 'cause he's dead.
Killed him.

739
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,377
Still managed to shake it
a little though.

740
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,490
<i>So how long you been doing this for?</i>

741
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,255
- Doing what? Driving?
- No. Jumping.

742
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,296
<i>Since I was five.</i>

743
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,298
- Five?
- Yeah.

744
01:01:11,439 --> 01:01:13,801
How'd you keep it a secret from people?

745
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:14,957
<i>- Like your parents.</i>

746
01:01:15,057 --> 01:01:17,270
It's pretty easy when
they're not around.

747
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,637
<i>Where were they?</i>

748
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,710
Not around.

749
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,107
You know, my mom...
she took off when I was five.

750
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,950
<i>I know what it's like
to not, you know...</i>

751
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:35,490
My dad, he...

752
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:37,958
Did I ask about your family?

753
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,187
<i>I mean, are we on
Oprah here or...</i>

754
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,308
<i># Do you want it</i>

755
01:01:47,408 --> 01:01:48,371
<i>Do you need it #</i>

756
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,962
<i># Let me hear it
Ladies and gentlemen #</i>

757
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:53,872
<i>Griffin, I can't keep
doing this. I gotta go.</i>

758
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:56,741
Her flight lands any second.
I need an answer.

759
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:03,946
This is it, all right?
Marvel Team-up, now or never.

760
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,682
A very limited run, right?

761
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,782
Save her, kill him, you know.
We're done.

762
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,361
All right, Spidey.

763
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,164
Hey!

764
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:19,426
<i>Due to increased security
measures, all bags...</i>

765
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:19,897
- Hey!

766
01:02:19,997 --> 01:02:22,766
<i>Detroit International
Airport asks you...</i>

767
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:24,897
<i>to keep your bags in your
possession at all times.</i>

768
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:29,411
<i>Flight 427 to Cleveland
will now be boarding at Gate Number 5.</i>

769
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,188
- Hey.

770
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:34,513
The flight from Rome landed an hour ago.

771
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,585
Oh, no.

772
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,386
<i>You didn't check on the flight?</i>

773
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,857
All right. Well, we gotta find her,
you know.

774
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,986
You go find her. I'm gonna arm up.
Meet me back at the lair.

775
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,996
- All right?
- Fine.

776
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,502
What you looking at?

777
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,408
Boo!

778
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:09,417
Hey. Uh, I'm Millie's friend,
David. Is she here?

779
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,248
Last I checked she was with you.

780
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,852
Hey. Your friend came by.

781
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,045
- What are you talking about?

782
01:03:18,145 --> 01:03:20,323
Black guy, white hair.
You just missed him.

783
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,826
- Jesus.
- Hey.

784
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,834
<i>David, wh...</i>

785
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,962
What the hell are you doing here?

786
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,302
I buzzed, but you didn't pick up.

787
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,750
- So you just broke in?
- Yeah. Well, I needed to

788
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,245
make sure that you were okay.

789
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,906
<i>No, David. I'm not okay.
I got left in an airport in Rome.</i>

790
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,553
I'm sorry.

791
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,923
You're sorry.

792
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,924
Thank you.

793
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,364
I think you should leave.

794
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,606
<i>David, you need to leave!</i>

795
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,575
<i>Come on. Snap to it.
We don't have much time.</i>

796
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,941
- What? What are you doing?
- Uh...

797
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,947
- David, I told you to leave.
- Uh...

798
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,449
<i>- Um...
- "Um" what?</i>

799
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:53,750
- I'm not in banking, okay?
- No, really?

800
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,202
- I mean, the money did come
from a bank, you know.

801
01:04:56,302 --> 01:04:56,492
Yeah.

802
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,385
- Uh, a few banks, actually.

803
01:04:58,485 --> 01:05:01,529
Are... Are you telling
me you're a bank robber?

804
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,599
Small part. Uh...

805
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,930
Will you please get out of my house?

806
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,011
Uh-huh.

807
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,512
Millie, I'm sorry.

808
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:24,051
Wh... Oh, my God. Okay.

809
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,621
<i>- I'm really sorry, but we gotta go.
- Just go. Leave me alone.</i>

810
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,020
Come on.

811
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,786
This might hurt a little bit, okay?

812
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,193
- It's okay.
- Where am I?

813
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,030
Trust me, okay?

814
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,331
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Don't you even come near me.

815
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,463
- Millie.
- Don't even come near me.

816
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:50,668
I'm gonna explain this, all right?
I'm gonna explain everything.

817
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,818
In here.

818
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,867
Just, uh... Just stay
where you are, all right?

819
01:05:57,967 --> 01:05:58,853
Just stay right there.

820
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,549
- David?
- Hurry up. It's closing.

821
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,373
<i>Griffin.</i>

822
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,505
There's something I gotta tell ya.

823
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:27,259
- Did you find her?

824
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,914
There's something that's
gonna piss you off.

825
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,452
- Piss me off?
- David.

826
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,613
What is this?

827
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,452
- David?
- What's she doing here?

828
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,327
- This isn't some kind
of clubhouse, you know.

829
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:38,049
<i>What is going on?</i>

830
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,752
<i>- Stay inside.
- Wanna see the top of Everest?</i>

831
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,955
- I was trying to tell you.
- Maybe the bottom?

832
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,123
- What?
- Griffin, listen to me. I...

833
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,133
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

834
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,533
By bringing her down here, they can
follow you. They have a machine.

835
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,265
- It can open wormholes
and keep them open.

836
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:51,368
What are you talking about?

837
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,066
I'm saying they can
follow us anywhere.

838
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,200
And you brought her here.

839
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,655
- Shit.
- There's two of you?

840
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,661
David, what is going on?

841
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,254
Millie... Millie, stay right here.

842
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,265
No. No!

843
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,669
- What have you done?
- Griffin...

844
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,762
- Where does this thing go?
- We gotta go.

845
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,670
David, what did you do?

846
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,118
<i>Video Game

847
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,318
Holy shit.

848
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,836
<i>Mom?</i>

849
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:47,581
<i>Thanks for leading me to your friend.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you
doing this to me? I never hurt you.</i>

851
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,560
I never hurt anybody.

852
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,765
Not yet, but you will.

853
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,834
Sooner or later, you all go bad.

854
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,199
What if I'm different?

855
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,872
- You're not different.
- I'm different.

856
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,674
- Boo.
- Move!

857
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:31,765
<i>It's time to send you home to mommy.</i>

858
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,056
<i>David?</i>

859
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,428
<i>Millie.</i>

860
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,649
<i>David?</i>

861
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:33,158
Millie, get out of here.
Run, okay?

862
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,627
<i>Millie. Millie, run!</i>

863
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,726
I'm gonna get you down
so you can get me out of here.

864
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,302
Great.

865
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:18,037
<i>Geez.</i>

866
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,945
Can you take me now, please?

867
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:42,655
Okay.
I'll take you.

868
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:45,131
I'll leave you alone.

869
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,833
It was always you though.

870
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,769
Ever since we were five.

871
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,015
It was always you.

872
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,185
Please just take me.

873
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:09,049
Take a deep breath.

874
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,635
I got it.
I trapped them there.

875
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:23,637
<i>Without the machine,
they're screwed.</i>

876
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,270
No. Millie.

877
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,937
- Got her!
- No!

878
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,536
<i>Millie.</i>

879
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,242
<i>Buddy. Wow.</i>

880
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,819
Crap. I, uh... I didn't expect that.
I... I didn't know.

881
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:47,159
Now they have to come to us.

882
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:49,231
Let's get these fires out.

883
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,730
<i>What's that?</i>

884
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,636
- Huh? What?
- What are you doing?

885
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:01,403
Nothing. I was, uh,
thinking about going bowling.

886
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,789
- What?

887
01:13:01,889 --> 01:13:03,910
What? Roland's in there
with his whole army.

888
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:06,413
I'm gonna go back there and end this.
What do you think?

889
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,983
<i>- I'm gonna blow 'em to Timbuktu...
- Yeah, but Millie's in there.</i>

890
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,052
Well, yeah, there is that as well.

891
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:13,678
<i>- I gotta go... I gotta go get her.
- Huh?</i>

892
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,758
Griffin, it's my fault that she's there.
All right? You...

893
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,417
<i>- You can't just...
- What?</i>

894
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,722
<i>We gotta get her out.
We have to get her out.</i>

895
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,593
I can hear you! I'm not deaf.
I understand what you're saying.

896
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,167
- All right. Well...
- It's a crying shame. It really is.

897
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,709
But you know what? We all have to...

898
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:29,499
make sacrifices once
in a while. You know.

899
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:33,874
Where's the detonator?

900
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,705
<i>I don't see you making any.</i>

901
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:38,279
You know what?
I made mine.

902
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,280
All right?

903
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:42,282
When I was five.

904
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:45,012
Came to my house
and killed my parents.

905
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,890
David, David.

906
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,546
Yeah?

907
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:19,813
<i>Look. Before this gets out ofhand,
let's just talk about this.</i>

908
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,014
How about
this for talking, huh?

909
01:14:26,114 --> 01:14:28,195
Am I getting the message through to you?

910
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,197
I can't let you do this.

911
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:34,065
Look, David. You touch the safe again,
and I'm gonna kill you. Have you got it?

912
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,940
Give me the detonator, David!

913
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:49,745
- Give it back!
- Sorry, Griffin!

914
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,682
Give it back!

915
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,220
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

916
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,296
Don't.

917
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,231
Bad move.

918
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,455
Hey!

919
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:41,200
Oh, shit.

920
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:01,484
<i>God, I hate Chechnya.</i>

921
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,593
Where'd you go?

922
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:22,766
<i>Well, then, brother,
I guess our limited run's done.</i>

923
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,892
<i>The old electricity trick.
That's a nice move.</i>

924
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,614
- Thanks.

925
01:16:45,714 --> 01:16:49,130
Cut me down, and, uh, we
can finish this, yeah?

926
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:52,401
You know, it didn't have to be this way.

927
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:55,204
There's five of them back there.
You go back there alone, you're dead.

928
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,870
You hear me?
You can't win!

929
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:01,643
Get me down, David!
You do this alone, and you're dead.

930
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,718
You're not a hero, David!

931
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:07,812
You're a Jumper!
You don't save the girl!

932
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,857
Don't you get it?

933
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,492
Whoa.

934
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:14,061
<i>Out of the way!</i>

935
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:25,905
<i>- Move!
- Watch it!</i>

936
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,339
<i>Got him!</i>

937
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,439
No!

938
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,549
Shit.

939
01:17:47,017 --> 01:17:49,521
There's some things
you can't jump, David.

940
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:04,042
<i>Only God should have this power.</i>

941
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:06,307
Not you, David.

942
01:18:07,842 --> 01:18:10,374
David, I'm so sorry
about what I said before.

943
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,950
Take a deep breath.

944
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:25,851
David. Hey. Hey.

945
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:29,829
David? Hey. Hey.

946
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,161
David!

947
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,735
- Ooh.
- Shit. I'm sorry.

948
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,804
- Oh, you...
- I'm sorry.

949
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:39,533
<i>What's my dishwasher
doing in the library?</i>

950
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,442
Oh.

951
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,812
David!

952
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,552
<i>- I'm impressed.
- Stay here, okay?</i>

953
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:53,882
What?

954
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,924
<i>You've come a long way
from robbing banks.</i>

955
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,102
I told you I'm different.

956
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,566
I could have dropped you
with the sharks.

957
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,393
Hi.

958
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:12,262
Can I help you?

959
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,336
Is-Is Mary here?

960
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,932
Hey, Mom.

961
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:30,183
Honey, why don't you wait upstairs?

962
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:32,253
Okay.

963
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,547
You know, it wasn't
easy finding you.

964
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:38,626
You shouldn't be here.

965
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:45,025
So it's true.

966
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,932
You're one of them.

967
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:50,595
Yes, it's true.

968
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,702
<i>You were five years old
your first jump.</i>

969
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,778
<i>I only had two choices.</i>

970
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:59,506
Kill you, or leave you.

971
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,548
So you left.

972
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:06,111
<i>- To protect you.
- I was five.</i>

973
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:12,320
I did what I had to do.

974
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,396
I've never stopped thinking about you.
Not even for one day.

975
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,903
So I'm a Jumper.
You're a Paladin.

976
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,976
That's right.

977
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,974
What now?

978
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,578
I'm giving you a head start, Son...

979
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,051
because I love you.

980
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,330
Good luck.

981
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:21,863
<i>Hey.</i>

982
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:29,331
- You okay?
- Yeah.

983
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,504
You sure?

984
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,576
Yeah. I am.

985
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,712
Good.

986
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:43,045
'Cause I'm freezing.
Can we please go someplace warm?

987
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:47,053
- Where do you want to go?
- Surprise me.
