1
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:06,247
Oh, hello.

2
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:28,962
Jean Francois?

3
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,288
Jean Francois?

4
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,361
Jean Francois.

5
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,724
You in the robes. Put down
the weapon of mass destruction

6
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:38,844
and get on the ground.
You're under arrest.

7
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,847
Put down your weapons now!

8
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:56,602
Why can't they ever do this
the easy way?

9
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:07,728
World Police.
Get down on the ground!

10
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:19,003
Hey, terrorist.

11
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,848
Terrorise this.

12
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:34,926
All right, let's make this interesting.

13
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,290
You lose.

14
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:08,723
- He's getting away with the WMD!
- I got him.

15
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:21,361
Damn, I missed him.

16
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:24,001
Sarah, he's got the bomb.
You got a fix?

17
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:28,166
I got him, Carson.
He's heading for the Louvre.

18
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,205
Your plans are over.

19
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,682
- All right, Sarah.
- Yeah, all right, team!

20
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,564
Nothing to it.

21
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:48,848
All right.

22
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:54,925
Bonjour, everyone. Don't worry.
Everything is bon.

23
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:56,804
We stopped the terrorists.

24
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:10,045
I was doing a lot of thinking
on the ride over here.

25
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,805
Oh, yeah? About what?

26
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,921
I was thinking that I want you
to marry me.

27
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:19,767
- Don't joke about that.
- Who's joking?

28
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:25,764
Joe to Sarah. Looks like we may
need to order up a wedding cake.

29
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:29,442
- He finally popped the question?
- Lisa, you're an amazing woman.

30
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:34,043
And a damn fine cop. And I want
to spend the rest of my life with you.

31
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,967
Oh, Carson. Carson...

32
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,607
Carson!

33
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:48,324
No!

34
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,645
Carson.

35
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:59,363
- Feel so cold.
- You have to hang on, Carson.

36
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:03,568
Sorry, babe. Looks like this
was a one-way ticket.

37
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:05,291
No.

38
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:08,566
Lisa, you have to live on.

39
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:12,521
Find someone else who will love you.
Find someone else and be happy.

40
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,962
You deserve...

41
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,524
No!

42
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,844
No!

43
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:25,283
No!

44
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,650
Everyone has AIDS

45
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:52,729
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

46
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:56,005
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS

47
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:59,170
Everyone has AIDS

48
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:03,011
And so this is the end of our story

49
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:06,404
And everyone is dead from AIDS

50
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:09,172
It took from me my best friend

51
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,806
My only true pal

52
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,644
My only bright star

53
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,041
He died of AIDS

54
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,681
Well, I'm gonna march on Washington

55
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:20,042
Lead the fight
and charge the brigades

56
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:23,286
There's a hero inside of all of us

57
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:24,811
I'll make them see
everyone has AIDS

58
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,247
- My father
- AIDS

59
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:28,680
- My sister
- AIDS

60
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:31,571
My uncle and my cousin
and her best friend

61
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:34,889
The gays and the straights
and the whites and the spades

62
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:38,323
- Everyone has AIDS
- My grandma and my dog Ole Blue

63
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:41,211
- AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
- The pope has got it and so do you

64
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:44,445
Come on, everybody
we got quilting to do

65
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:46,331
We're gonna break down
these barricades

66
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,921
Everyone has
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

67
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:51,168
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

68
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:53,363
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS

69
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:04,691
- Great job, Gary.
- Thanks. You too, Steve.

70
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,803
That was the greatest acting
I've ever seen.

71
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,684
I just don't know how you do it, Gary.

72
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,723
How do you make yourself
so sombre and emotional

73
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,206
to make everybody cry like that?

74
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:18,009
It's not that hard, really. I just think
about the saddest moment in my life.

75
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:25,405
Man, wow.
Gary is such a great guy.

76
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:34,644
Gary. Oh, no.
Help me! Help me!

77
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:38,606
Get off of me!
Get this thing off of me! Gary!

78
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,970
Hello, young man. Congratulations
on a terrific performance.

79
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:46,249
Oh, thank you.
I don't believe we've met, Mr?

80
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:50,361
The name is Spottswoode.

81
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:54,529
- Well, nice to meet you.
- And you are Gary Johnston.

82
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:57,883
All-American actor who graduated
lowa University summa cum laude

83
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:00,726
with a double major in theatre
and world languages.

84
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,526
You've been at the top of every
acting class since you were a child.

85
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:06,804
Top-gun actor.

86
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:10,045
Hey, hold on a second,
are you from Hollywood?

87
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:15,764
I have an incredible offer for you, Gary.
If you're interested, follow me this way.

88
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,569
Please, Gary, step into my car.

89
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:40,005
Oh, I get it.

90
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,931
I'm supposed to get in your car
and let you put your finger inside me.

91
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,248
Then if I go down on you,
I get a movie part.

92
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,205
No, I just want to show
you something.

93
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:50,965
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.
- Please, Gary,

94
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:52,321
I'm not from Hollywood.

95
00:09:52,532 --> 00:09:56,366
I'm not going to fuck your mouth,
and my time is extremely valuable.

96
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:10,009
- Jesus, this is a nice limo.
- Yes, it is.

97
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,282
Now, suck my cock.

98
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,891
Just kidding.

99
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:24,212
All right, just what the hell
is this about?

100
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:27,006
I hate to break this to you, Gary,

101
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,680
but some people out there
want you dead.

102
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,482
- Dead?
- They're called terrorists, Gary.

103
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,688
And they hate everything about you.

104
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:38,767
Why? What did I do to them?
I'm just a Broadway actor.

105
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,446
It's not who you are, Gary,
it's what you stand for.

106
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,404
And every single minute
of every single day,

107
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:45,568
the terrorists are planning
new ways to kill you

108
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:49,242
and everyone else
who lives in a free country.

109
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:53,883
The only thing standing
in their way is us.

110
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,326
You?

111
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,167
Baxter, I think we can
"valmorphanize" safely now.

112
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:34,240
Okay, a limousine that can fly.
Now I have seen everything.

113
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,569
Really? Have you seen a man
eat his own head?

114
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:40,332
- No.
- So then you haven't seen everything.

115
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,363
And neither have we.

116
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,369
Last week in Paris,
we caught four terrorists

117
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:46,802
with a weapon of mass destruction.

118
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:50,607
The terrorists are planning
something very big.

119
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:53,087
And just what does this have
to do with me?

120
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,408
Our only hope is to have somebody
act like a terrorist

121
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:58,251
who wants to help them
carry out the attack.

122
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:03,048
An actor convincing enough to make
the terrorists think he's one of them.

123
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,720
This is crazy. I'm an actor, not a spy.

124
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:09,368
That's all spying is: Acting.
And they say you're the best.

125
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:12,405
An actor with a double major
in theatre and world languages?

126
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,843
Hell, you're the perfect weapon, Gary.

127
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,970
Look out!

128
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:51,764
Right this way,
you maverick renegade.

129
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:05,203
Welcome to Team Base.

130
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:09,291
Gary, this is Joe, all-star quarterback
from the University of Nebraska.

131
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:10,971
He's a natural-born leader.

132
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,128
I've heard a lot about your acting,
Mr Johnston.

133
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:16,927
- Hope it's as good as they say it is.
- And this is Sarah,

134
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:19,441
the top empath from Berkeley's
School for the Clairvoyant

135
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,051
in San Francisco.

136
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:25,570
I sense that you're slightly
confused right now.

137
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:29,771
That's supposed to be Carson's
replacement, a fucking actor?

138
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,480
Don't mind Chris.
He may be lacking courtesy,

139
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:35,565
but he's the best martial-arts expert
Detroit has to offer.

140
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:39,481
That's right, actor.
Just stay the fuck away from me.

141
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:44,330
And finally, we have our
psychology expert. Where's Lisa?

142
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,204
Right here.

143
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:57,810
Gary, this is Lisa. She specialises
in how the terrorists think.

144
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:01,806
Usually a case of malignant narcissism
brought on during childhood.

145
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,282
We've been doing our best
to keep the world safe, Gary.

146
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:07,444
But now somebody has supplied
the terrorists with WMDs.

147
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:10,086
And intelligence tells us
they plan to use them.

148
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,203
Isn't that right,
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E?

149
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:15,768
- That is affirmative.
- I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E?

150
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,486
The most sophisticated computer
in the world.

151
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,843
I've intercepted communications
that several terrorist groups

152
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:25,362
are being organised for one
massive worldwide attack.

153
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,369
From what I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.
has gathered,

154
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:30,006
it would be 9/11 times 100.

155
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:34,162
9/11 times 100?
Jesus, that's...

156
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:38,246
Yes, 91,100.

157
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:42,368
Basically, all the worst parts
of the Bible.

158
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:45,126
So now you see why we need you.

159
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:49,251
We will disguise you as a terrorist and
take you deep into the Middle East.

160
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:52,649
If your acting is successful, you'll be
able to get us all the information we need

161
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,008
to stop this whole thing
from happening.

162
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:57,806
Of course, if you're not interested...

163
00:14:58,012 --> 00:14:59,968
...there's the door.

164
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:03,927
All right. Thanks.

165
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:17,332
Gary. Hey, hold on a second.

166
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:20,848
Don't you understand?
Every country in the world is in danger.

167
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:23,566
How is it my responsibility
to do something?

168
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:27,811
Because like it or not, you're the one
with the power to do something.

169
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:33,881
I can't fight terrorists. I don't know
anything about guns or jets.

170
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:37,209
That doesn't matter.
If you wanna help people,

171
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:41,570
all that matters, Gary,
is what you have here.

172
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,928
Just think about it, okay?
Here, take this.

173
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:58,561
Baxter will take you wherever
you wanna go. Just remember:

174
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:01,650
Your freedom is at stake too.

175
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:15,281
What do you think Spottswoode
sees in him?

176
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:18,802
I don't know. But I think I see it too.

177
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,923
Hey, Baxter.

178
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:40,245
I wanna take a detour.

179
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:42,882
What would you do

180
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:47,608
If you were asked to give up
your dreams for freedom?

181
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,764
What would you do

182
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:54,011
If asked to make
the ultimate sacrifice?

183
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,409
Would you think about
all them people

184
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:01,207
who gave up everything they had?

185
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:04,609
Would you think about
all them war vets

186
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:09,010
and would you start to feel bad?

187
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,526
Freedom isn't free

188
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,327
It costs folks like you and me

189
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,602
And if we don't all chip in

190
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:24,283
we'll never pay that bill

191
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,210
Freedom isn't free

192
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:31,848
No, there's a hefty fucking fee

193
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:38,491
And if you don't throw in
your buck o'five, who will?

194
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,769
Buck o'five

195
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:46,841
Freedom costs a buck o'five

196
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:26,890
Our dear leader, Kim Jong II, says
the weapons of mass destruction

197
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,731
you requested are ready
for you to take.

198
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,564
I am still in the process of recruiting

199
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:33,967
and training new terrorists
for the attack.

200
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:36,640
We take weapons later.

201
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:46,285
He asks what part of the deal
you did not understand.

202
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,086
He says perhaps his translator
did not make it clear to you.

203
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:52,807
He says he should fire
his translator?

204
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:59,369
Do you have any idea
how fucking busy I am?

205
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:02,410
I cannot berieve that I have
a Chechnyan standing here terring me

206
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,404
when he's gonna take a derivery.

207
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:06,165
Herro?

208
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,761
Perhaps we can be ready sooner.

209
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:11,082
Yes, perhaps you can.

210
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:13,288
Now, take your weapons
of mass destruction

211
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:16,609
and get the fuck out of here.

212
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:35,810
I had to come back.

213
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:38,964
- I know you did, son.
- I still say this is a fucking mistake.

214
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,807
Stop it, Chris. I sense that you're
making him feel intimidated.

215
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,365
Gary, I'm afraid there's no time.

216
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:46,847
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.
tells us the attack is imminent.

217
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,805
We need you to act like
a Middle Eastern terrorist right away.

218
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:53,687
There's just one problem.
I don't look Middle Eastern.

219
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:57,726
Leave that to us.

220
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:09,732
Sarah's a professional at skin grafting
and laser "valmoriphication."

221
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:12,963
Sarah's a professional at skin grafting
and laser "valmoriphication."

222
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,043
Just try to be still.

223
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,884
Amazing.

224
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:53,645
The valmoriphication
completely worked.

225
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,808
Sit up and take a look, Gary.

226
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:03,291
It's uncanny.

227
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,646
You're going to fool everyone, Gary.

228
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:07,841
Or should I say...

229
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:10,202
...Hakmed.

230
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:14,168
All right, team, we've only got
one shot at this, so listen up.

231
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,528
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.
has intercepted communications

232
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,804
that terrorists from different countries
are gathering at a tavern here,

233
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,210
- in Cairo.
- Cairo. That's in Egypt.

234
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:25,965
Exactly right, Joe.

235
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:29,926
Now, team, your mission will be
to get Gary into that tavern.

236
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,965
And once he's on the inside,
cover his back.

237
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,163
Gary, you must use
your acting to find out

238
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:38,250
any information you can
from the terrorists.

239
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:42,850
Gary, if for some reason
your cover is blown

240
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,043
and the terrorists take you prisoner,

241
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:48,568
well, you'll probably want
to take your own life.

242
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,206
Here, you'd better have this.

243
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:58,925
All right, team, that's it.
We've got a job to do.

244
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:02,448
Let's go police the world.

245
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:05,729
America

246
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:09,004
America

247
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:11,812
America
Fuck, yeah

248
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,651
Coming again to save
the motherfucking day, yeah

249
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:17,320
America
Fuck, yeah

250
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:19,961
Freedom is the only way, yeah

251
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,606
Terrorists, your game is through

252
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:25,280
'Cause now you have to answer to

253
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:27,767
America
Fuck, yeah

254
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,886
So lick my butt
and suck on my balls

255
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,965
America
Fuck, yeah

256
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:38,081
What if the old man is wrong
about him, huh?

257
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:41,722
What if he's not the great actor
Spottswoode says he is?

258
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:45,810
Why don't you trust actors, Chris?

259
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,646
I got my reasons.

260
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,010
You all right, Gary?

261
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:57,650
I was just thinking.

262
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:01,128
On-stage, if I mess up a line,
it could mean a bad review.

263
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:03,323
If I mess up here,

264
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,363
we're all dead.

265
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:08,810
I believe you can do this, Gary.

266
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:12,249
Why? What reason do you
have to believe?

267
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:17,850
Sometimes believing is all we have.

268
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:12,684
Fear not, Muslim friends.
We're here to find terrorists.

269
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:16,089
I'm clearing your minds of all anxiety.

270
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,768
All right, good job, Sarah.
Now, everyone make for the tavern.

271
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,440
Let's get one thing straight, actor.
I don't trust you.

272
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:25,644
If you betray us, I'll rip your fucking
balls off and stuff them up your ass

273
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:28,730
so that the next time you shit,
you'll shit all over your balls, got it?

274
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:31,162
- What's your problem with me?
- Yeah, you wanna go?

275
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:32,407
Guys, guys, guys!

276
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:35,172
Don't you see this is just
what the terrorists want us to do?

277
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:39,763
The war is out there, man. Out there.
Now, pull it together.

278
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:44,526
All right, team, let's move
to the inner city. Keep it quiet.

279
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:56,567
- Clear.
- Clear.

280
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:57,727
- Clear.
- Clear.

281
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,570
Gary, you follow me.
The rest of the team,

282
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:02,570
take super-secret hiding positions
Alpha One.

283
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:07,360
All right, that's the tavern
with the blue door.

284
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:11,605
Act your way past those guards
and see what you can find out.

285
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:14,571
Remember, if you think they're
onto you, give us the signal.

286
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:16,967
You remember the signal?

287
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:21,768
That's right. All right, good luck.

288
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,411
Go get them, cowboy.

289
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:57,371
Oh, shit.

290
00:25:57,612 --> 00:26:00,080
Come on, Gary, act.
You have the power.

291
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:20,487
- All right, Gary!
- Told you he was top gun.

292
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:24,645
- I've never seen acting that good.
- He's amazing.

293
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:44,166
Yeah, no, I know.
It's terrible, terrible.

294
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:49,451
We are Bashir rebels from
the country of Somalia. Who are you?

295
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:55,164
My name is Hakmed.
I'm a terrorist.

296
00:26:57,052 --> 00:27:00,886
Anybody know of any terrorist attacks
coming up soon?

297
00:27:13,772 --> 00:27:16,809
I sense that I'm becoming
attracted to Gary.

298
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:20,850
My advice is not to get involved
with a team member, Sarah.

299
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:24,089
It's too painful to see them die.

300
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:26,607
I'm sorry, Lisa.
I didn't mean to bring up...

301
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:30,162
It's okay, Sarah.
I treasure your friendship.

302
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,767
I treasure yours, Lisa.

303
00:27:38,652 --> 00:27:42,361
Hey, have you ever thought
of telling Sarah how you feel?

304
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:47,370
What would a girl like Sarah want
with a simple Nebraska boy like me?

305
00:27:47,572 --> 00:27:50,803
I don't know nothing about fancy cars
and fancy restaurants.

306
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:56,202
Still, I'd love to show her
a full-moon night on the cornfields.

307
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:10,803
What do you know?

308
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:14,523
I heard there might be
a large terrorist attack.

309
00:28:14,732 --> 00:28:18,247
If you tell me what it is,
maybe I could help out.

310
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:21,689
Get out of here. We have put out
a jihad on the infidels

311
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,366
because they destroyed our lives.

312
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:28,566
What do you know
about pain and sadness?

313
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:32,570
Gary. Help me! Help me!

314
00:28:32,772 --> 00:28:36,481
Get him off!
Get this thing off of me! Gary!

315
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:41,085
I was just a boy when the infidels
came to my village

316
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:43,965
in their Black Hawk helicopters.

317
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:48,964
The infidels fired at the oil fields
and they lit up like the eyes of Allah.

318
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:52,642
Burning oil rained down from the sky
and cooked everything it touched.

319
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:55,650
I could only hide myself and cry
as my goats were consumed

320
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:57,649
by the fiery, black liquid death.

321
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,090
In the midst of the chaos,

322
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:06,729
I could swear that I heard my goats
screaming for help.

323
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:12,008
As quickly as they had come,
the infidels were gone.

324
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:16,524
It was on that day
I put a jihad on them.

325
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:22,930
And if you don't believe it,
then you better kill me now,

326
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:26,283
because I'll put a jihad on you too.

327
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:34,928
I like you. You have balls.

328
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:37,521
I like balls.

329
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:41,687
All right, listen carefully.
The WMDs are located

330
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,850
in a secret bunker 20 yards east
of this building.

331
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,441
You can help us by guarding it
and making...

332
00:29:51,252 --> 00:29:52,970
Come. They're onto us!

333
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:54,930
Hurry, friend.
We must make our escape.

334
00:29:58,772 --> 00:30:02,526
Shit. I've got five terrorists going
southeast on Baka laka daka Street.

335
00:30:02,892 --> 00:30:04,041
Don't let them get away.

336
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:12,002
I sense Gary's trapped
inside the tavern.

337
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:15,289
Copy, Sarah. You get Gary,
we'll go after the terrorists.

338
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:18,609
America

339
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:21,366
America
Fuck, yeah

340
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,291
Coming again to save
the motherfucking day, yeah

341
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:26,881
America
Fuck, yeah

342
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:30,243
Freedom is the only way, yeah

343
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:32,960
It's the dream that we all share

344
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:36,251
It's the hope for tomorrow

345
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:38,005
Go faster, you idiot.

346
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:45,811
Die! Infidels!

347
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:55,400
- They're not stopping.
- They had their chance.

348
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:05,331
Missed. Wide right.

349
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,882
One of the terrorists is trying
to tell us something.

350
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,130
It's me. It's me.

351
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:15,888
Looks like he's saying,
"Kiss me. Kiss me."

352
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:17,286
Smartass motherfucker.

353
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,361
- Gary?
- An infidel.

354
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:35,409
Kill her.

355
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:46,565
Gary?

356
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:53,649
- Sarah to Team America Four.
- What you got, Sarah?

357
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:57,089
Gary isn't in the tavern.
I think he may be with...

358
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,602
- Say again, Sarah. You're breaking up.
- Joe, do you copy?

359
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,412
- I'll get him.
- Lisa?

360
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,410
I lost her.

361
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:11,922
It's all right. We'll kill these guys,
then we'll find out what she wants.

362
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,645
Right.

363
00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:22,044
Hey, guys, I think
we should pull over.

364
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:23,890
Pull over? Yes, of course.

365
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,845
Pull over, let them pass us, and when
they turn around, we charge them.

366
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:28,565
I love your balls.

367
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:33,804
Shit, they got by me.

368
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:40,323
- What are we doing?
- This jeep is filled with explosives.

369
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:42,921
We're going to take their lives
and our own.

370
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:44,929
We're gonna what?

371
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:47,888
- Hang on, Joe.
- Die, infidels.

372
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:00,246
Surprise, cockfags!

373
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:19,848
All right. We fucking did it.

374
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:27,968
Spottswoode, it's Lisa. Gary found the
WMDs and the terrorists are down.

375
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,006
Great job, team. Head back to base
for debriefing and cocktails.

376
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:38,922
This is breaking news
with Peter Jennings.

377
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:42,684
Team America has once again
pissed off the entire world

378
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:44,644
after blowing up half of Cairo.

379
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:47,650
And now some Hollywood celebrities
are lashing out.

380
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:51,242
Alec Baldwin is head
of the Film Actors Guild.

381
00:33:52,012 --> 00:33:53,331
The Film Actors Guild believes

382
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,921
that what the world needs
is compassion, not violence.

383
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:59,807
All that Team America
does is create new enemies.

384
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:02,163
Let me explain to you
how this works.

385
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,523
You see, the corporations
finance Team America.

386
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:09,168
And then Team America goes out,
and the corporations sit there in their...

387
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:13,411
In their corporation buildings,
and, see, they're all corporation-y,

388
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:16,126
and they make money.

389
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:17,970
Last year I went to Iraq.

390
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:20,925
Before Team America showed up,
it was a happy place.

391
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,009
They had flowery meadows
and rainbow skies

392
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:25,362
and rivers made of chocolate,
where the children danced

393
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:28,609
and laughed and played
with gumdrop smiles.

394
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:30,609
The actors are calling
for an emergency meeting.

395
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:32,768
Already expected to attend
are Helen Hunt,

396
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:37,727
George Clooney, Liv Tyler,
Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,

397
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:40,241
Janeane Garofalo
and Matt Damon.

398
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:43,125
Matt Damon.

399
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:46,369
In the meantime, the world wants
to deal with dangerous individuals

400
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:47,800
their own way.

401
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:08,045
Hans Brix? Oh, no.

402
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:12,529
Oh, herro,
great to see you again, Hans.

403
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:16,088
Mr II, I was supposed to be allowed
to inspect your palace today,

404
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:19,329
and your guards won't let me into
certain areas.

405
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:22,683
Hans, Hans, Hans. We've been
through this a dozen times.

406
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:26,521
I don't have any weapons
of mass destruction, okay, Hans?

407
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:29,804
Then let me look around
so I can ease the UN's collective mind.

408
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:33,163
Hans, you're breaking my barrs here.
Hans, you're breaking my barrs.

409
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:35,966
I'm sorry, but the UN must be
firm with you.

410
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:39,130
Let me see your whole palace
or else.

411
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:41,368
Or else what?

412
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:45,360
Or else we will be very,
very angry with you.

413
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:49,645
And we will write you a letter
telling you how angry we are.

414
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:53,250
Okay, I'll show you, Hans.
You ready?

415
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,329
Stand a rittle to your reft.

416
00:35:57,412 --> 00:35:59,050
A rittle more.

417
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:01,331
Good.

418
00:36:07,012 --> 00:36:08,047
There you go, Hans Brix.

419
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:11,244
How you rike that,
you fucking cocksucker?

420
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:16,569
Do you have any idea
how fucking busy I am, Hans Brix?

421
00:36:16,812 --> 00:36:18,723
Well, fuck you.
You want inspection?

422
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:22,368
Well, inspect that,
you buttfucking piece of shit.

423
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:25,282
What, you think I'm just
a petty arms dearer?

424
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:27,050
I'm pranning the attack.

425
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:31,689
Congraturations, Team America,
you have stopped nothing.

426
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:53,242
Congratulations, Gary.
You've done an amazing thing.

427
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:57,081
It will be years before the terrorists
have the resources to attack again.

428
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:59,601
We're gonna be unstoppable
with you on the team, Gary.

429
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:02,406
Terrorists, your game is through.

430
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,445
You're the best, Gary.

431
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:09,204
So this terrorist is shooting at us
from the back of his jeep, and he...

432
00:37:09,412 --> 00:37:11,289
You might have all the others fooled,
but not me.

433
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:14,370
Your acting was reckless
and it put us all in danger.

434
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:17,723
The next time you pull a stunt like that,
I'll drill two holes through your dick

435
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:21,527
so that when you pee, it shoots out
in all different directions. You got it?

436
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:25,169
Hey, Sarah, do you mind
if I dance with you?

437
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:27,647
No, of course not, Joe.

438
00:37:36,812 --> 00:37:40,043
Joe, do you think it's okay
for team members to date?

439
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:43,082
Sarah, really?

440
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:44,930
Yeah. Do you think it's all right?

441
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:47,487
I think it's better than all right.
It's great!

442
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:49,842
Oh, good. I'm so glad you think so.

443
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:05,085
Gary? You okay?

444
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:11,167
I was just wondering if I can let go
of an old, painful memory.

445
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:14,121
Is it anything
that you wanna talk about?

446
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:18,691
When I was a kid, I always looked up
to my older brother, Tommy.

447
00:38:18,892 --> 00:38:21,929
He was the jock,
and I was the little performer.

448
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:24,962
We were all out at the zoo one day.

449
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:29,245
I was doing some acting, walking
on the railing of the gorilla exhibit.

450
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:31,170
I fell in.

451
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:34,523
Everyone screamed,
and Tommy jumped in after me,

452
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:37,849
forgetting that he had blueberries
in his front pocket.

453
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:40,803
The gorillas just went wild.

454
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:44,204
They jumped all over his body
and threw him around like a rag doll

455
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:46,050
to get to those blueberries.

456
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:50,325
One gorilla would throw him to another
gorilla, who tossed him to another.

457
00:38:52,812 --> 00:38:55,087
Everyone panicked and cried out
for somebody to help,

458
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,169
but it was too late.

459
00:38:57,372 --> 00:39:02,446
The gorillas beat him to death before
the zookeepers could gas them all.

460
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:07,005
My acting...

461
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,770
...got my brother killed.

462
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,610
I've had to live with that...

463
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:13,087
...every single day.

464
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:17,046
Gary, you can't blame yourself
for what gorillas did.

465
00:39:17,412 --> 00:39:19,767
I think I can finally let it go.

466
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:23,248
Because my acting
saved the entire world.

467
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:25,164
And something
even better happened.

468
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:26,851
What?

469
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:31,091
I met somebody
who took my breath away.

470
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:38,127
Gary, no.

471
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:39,647
I'm sorry.

472
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:43,527
It's just...
Things are really complicated, Gary.

473
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,609
I know about Carson.

474
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:48,167
I know how it feels.

475
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:50,363
God, I'm so confused.

476
00:39:50,572 --> 00:39:53,245
It's too soon to be
having feelings for you.

477
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:58,764
Maybe feelings are feelings
because we can't control them.

478
00:39:59,052 --> 00:40:00,610
But I have to control them

479
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:03,610
because I can't go through losing
somebody again. It's too painful.

480
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:06,121
So... So, what, you're just
gonna shut down?

481
00:40:06,332 --> 00:40:07,970
I really like you.

482
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,050
There's no chance
we can ever be together?

483
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:15,968
Only if you could promise me
you'll never die.

484
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:18,128
You know I can't promise that.

485
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,563
If you did that,
I would make love to you right now.

486
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:29,567
I promise. I will never die.

487
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:52,367
I need this, I need love
I need you

488
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:59,211
I don't need one heartbeat
I need two

489
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:03,044
There's an emptiness I need to fill

490
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,450
And only one emptiness will do

491
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:13,682
Only a woman
can brighten up my day

492
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:20,691
Only a woman
can touch me the right way, yeah

493
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:27,206
Only a woman
is allowed to touch me there

494
00:41:27,412 --> 00:41:31,371
All I ask
is that you're a woman

495
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,326
Lisa, you're the most amazing person
I've ever met.

496
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:39,201
It's only been a short time,
but I think that I'm completely in love...

497
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:41,767
Let's not talk.

498
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:43,963
I can't help it.
This just feels so right,

499
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,732
and I don't want anything
to mess it up.

500
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:53,164
There's not a thing in the world
that can mess this up.

501
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:39,611
Team, I'm afraid I have bad news.

502
00:43:39,812 --> 00:43:44,761
At 7:15 this morning,
the terrorists carried out their attack.

503
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:47,802
- What?
- But how can that be?

504
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:49,968
Gary stopped the terrorists
in Cairo.

505
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:52,208
It appears now that
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. was wrong

506
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,562
about the Chechnyans
being in charge.

507
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:56,603
That was bad,
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

508
00:43:56,812 --> 00:44:00,122
- Very bad I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.
- I'm sorry.

509
00:44:00,332 --> 00:44:03,722
We have to find out who did this
and take them down. Fast.

510
00:44:05,132 --> 00:44:08,442
Sir, I am intercepting communications
about the terrorists' identities.

511
00:44:08,652 --> 00:44:10,643
On screen.

512
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:14,049
This is breaking news
with Peter Jennings.

513
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,971
An attack in Panama today
has left thousands dead.

514
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:21,085
Taking credit were terrorists
from Derka Derkastan.

515
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,328
Of course, Derka Derkastan.

516
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:25,966
The terrorists claim that the attack
was a retaliation

517
00:44:26,172 --> 00:44:28,402
for Team America's actions in Cairo.

518
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:32,048
Alec Baldwin is rallying all
the members of the Film Actors Guild.

519
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,402
- Alec Baldwin?
- Gary?

520
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:36,330
He's my hero.

521
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:38,602
The single greatest actor
of all time.

522
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:42,169
Who is to blame for these attacks
in Panama?

523
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:43,600
The terrorists?

524
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:45,928
The person who supplied them
with WMDs?

525
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:49,727
No. Blame Team America.

526
00:44:50,612 --> 00:44:54,571
Their reckless disregard in Cairo
brought on this violence today.

527
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:59,971
Team America, the blood of the victims
of Panama is on your hands.

528
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:04,563
Moved by Baldwin's
impassioned speech,

529
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:07,764
hundreds of people turned out
at Mount Rushmore today to protest.

530
00:45:11,852 --> 00:45:13,683
Hey, that's here.

531
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:16,247
Tom, it looks like filmmaker
Michael Moore

532
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:20,047
is also jumping on the
"Fuck Team America" bandwagon.

533
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:22,450
Protesting is not enough.

534
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:26,486
We must take radical action against
the fascists in our own country.

535
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:29,889
Bring it down! Bring it all down!

536
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:38,170
Team, if the Derka Derkastanis
have weapons of mass destruction,

537
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:42,325
I'm afraid it could be
9/11 times 1,000.

538
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:44,244
- Jesus, you mean?
- Yes.

539
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:47,808
Nine hundred and eleven thousand.

540
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,889
Then forget all these assholes.
We got work to do.

541
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:53,085
Yes, let's get Gary valmorphanized
so he can use his acting.

542
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,691
My acting?

543
00:45:54,892 --> 00:45:58,328
My acting? My acting just got
a thousand people killed.

544
00:45:58,532 --> 00:45:59,931
Jesus, I've done it again.

545
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,204
Pull yourself together, Gary.
We need you now more than ever.

546
00:46:03,452 --> 00:46:05,488
- I'm through with this.
- Gary, you can't go.

547
00:46:05,692 --> 00:46:07,091
Without you, the team is doomed.

548
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:10,523
Remember, there is no "l"
in Team America.

549
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:12,609
Yes, there is.

550
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:16,811
I know it's hard, Gary.

551
00:46:17,012 --> 00:46:19,970
But you're still the only hope
to stop these newer terrorists.

552
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:22,845
Why me? Why am I the only one?

553
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:24,724
Because you're the one
with the power to...

554
00:46:24,932 --> 00:46:27,730
Well, I don't want the fucking power!

555
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:31,283
I don't want the guilt,
I don't want the shame

556
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:33,244
and I don't want the responsibility.

557
00:46:33,532 --> 00:46:36,171
Then what about all the things
you promised last night?

558
00:46:36,372 --> 00:46:38,044
You said you'd never leave.

559
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:43,323
I said I'd never die.
But now I'm dead inside.

560
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:46,442
You slept with Gary?

561
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,125
- Sarah.
- But you knew I liked Gary.

562
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:53,243
I told you.

563
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:56,012
You like Gary?

564
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:58,521
Oh, I see.

565
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:02,208
- I didn't plan on it happening, Sarah.
- Save it, Lisa.

566
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:07,168
You see? All I do is hurt people.

567
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:10,722
Gary, you didn't kill your brother.
Those gorillas did.

568
00:47:14,172 --> 00:47:16,766
I'm sorry I'm not the man
you think I am.

569
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:19,327
I'm just bad news.

570
00:47:20,252 --> 00:47:22,527
I'll never act again.

571
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:31,411
Fuck him. We don't need an actor.

572
00:47:31,612 --> 00:47:33,045
We can take out
the Derka Derkastanis

573
00:47:33,252 --> 00:47:34,844
the old-fashioned way.

574
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:37,128
No. It would be a suicide mission.

575
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:41,081
That's all right.
I feel a little bit like dying.

576
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:45,763
Goddamn it, Gary.

577
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:53,892
America
Fuck, yeah

578
00:47:53,892 --> 00:47:55,723
America
Fuck, yeah

579
00:47:56,812 --> 00:48:01,886
Coming again to save
the motherfucking day, yeah

580
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:06,404
America
Fuck, yeah

581
00:48:07,772 --> 00:48:13,085
Freedom is the only way
Yeah

582
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:18,207
Terrorists, your game is through

583
00:48:18,412 --> 00:48:22,849
'Cause now you have to answer to

584
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:29,125
America
Fuck, yeah

585
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:33,567
America
Fuck

586
00:48:33,772 --> 00:48:37,765
Gary! Help me!
Get this thing off of me! Gary!

587
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:44,408
All right, team.
We're nearing Derka Derkastan.

588
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:46,170
Let's get ready.

589
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:49,169
Look out! We've got terrorist aircraft.

590
00:48:55,652 --> 00:48:57,722
There's only five of them, team.
This should be easy.

591
00:48:57,972 --> 00:48:59,405
I've got Korean aircraft at 1 o'clock.

592
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:02,526
What are they doing here?

593
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:09,482
Shoot them down. Rike dogs.

594
00:49:09,732 --> 00:49:12,246
Kim Jong II?
Why is he helping terrorists?

595
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:21,525
I've got one on my tail!

596
00:49:23,652 --> 00:49:25,165
I got you, Sarah.

597
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:30,731
Bring in the submarines.

598
00:49:33,852 --> 00:49:37,208
What the hell? Something's shooting
at us from the water.

599
00:49:37,412 --> 00:49:40,529
- It must be a Korean sub.
- Chris, you've gotta take them out.

600
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:42,802
I'm already on it.

601
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:49,965
These guys really snuck up on us.

602
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:52,686
Yeah, there's a lot of that
going around lately.

603
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:55,247
Sarah, you know I didn't mean
to hurt you.

604
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:57,010
No, you just didn't care if you did.

605
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:00,730
Now, come on, Sarah,
that isn't fair.

606
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:03,207
Lisa can't help it
if Gary has feelings for her.

607
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:07,047
Just like nobody can help it
if you have feelings for Gary.

608
00:50:11,252 --> 00:50:12,731
What is that supposed to mean?

609
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:14,724
Oh, come on, Sarah.
You mean you never realised

610
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:16,604
Joe has feelings for you?

611
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:21,968
Joe? But you're like a brother to me.

612
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,969
That's all I ever am. Like a brother.
It isn't fair.

613
00:50:32,932 --> 00:50:35,207
Hang on, team.
Someone has broken into the hangar.

614
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:37,721
- Baxter?
- Hey, Team America.

615
00:50:37,972 --> 00:50:40,122
I got something for you.

616
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:43,489
- What the hell?
- Prepare to die.

617
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:49,086
Jesus titty-fucking...

618
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:53,561
...Christ!

619
00:50:54,212 --> 00:50:55,247
Spottswoode!

620
00:50:57,692 --> 00:50:59,125
Oh, my God!

621
00:51:00,652 --> 00:51:03,007
No. He can't be dead.

622
00:51:03,932 --> 00:51:05,809
We've lost I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

623
00:51:06,052 --> 00:51:08,361
I repeat,
we have no I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

624
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:11,570
Their computers are down.
Attack!

625
00:51:15,412 --> 00:51:17,972
- Sarah!
- I sense I'm going down.

626
00:51:20,252 --> 00:51:22,368
Sarah! God, Chris,
you gotta help her.

627
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,443
I'm on it. Just hang on, Sarah.

628
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,090
Oh, fuck, I've been hit.

629
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:31,688
Chris, come in.

630
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:34,082
- Oh, Jesus, I'm hit!
- Lisa!

631
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:35,287
- Going down.
- Goddamn it,

632
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,448
I'm gonna have to breach.

633
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:42,130
I'm gonna hit the water.

634
00:51:43,212 --> 00:51:44,884
Missile lock. I've got missile lock.

635
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:47,168
I've gotta bail out.

636
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:07,045
Salvage their ships. If you find anyone
arive, you know what to do with them.

637
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:12,169
Terrorists on screen.

638
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:16,921
Okay, who brew up Panama Canal?

639
00:52:17,172 --> 00:52:19,049
We were angry about Cairo.

640
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:21,288
Goddamn it, how many times
do I have to tell you?

641
00:52:21,492 --> 00:52:24,165
You don't use the WMDs
until you see the signal.

642
00:52:24,372 --> 00:52:26,044
I have worked ten years
on this pran.

643
00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:28,846
It is a very precise
and a compricated pran.

644
00:52:29,052 --> 00:52:31,088
I am sick of you terrorists
fucking it up.

645
00:52:31,332 --> 00:52:32,765
Now, take the weapons
where I told you

646
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:36,885
and wait for the goddamn signal
this time. Goodbye.

647
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:41,084
Why is everyone so fucking stupid?

648
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,646
Why aren't more people interrigent?
Rike me?

649
00:52:47,452 --> 00:52:51,365
I'm so ronery

650
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:53,403
So ronery

651
00:52:53,612 --> 00:52:57,161
So ronery and sadry arone

652
00:52:57,372 --> 00:53:01,650
There's no one
Just me onry

653
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:05,447
Sitting on my rittle throne

654
00:53:05,692 --> 00:53:09,367
I work rearry hard
and make up great prans

655
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:13,690
But nobody ristens
No one understands

656
00:53:13,892 --> 00:53:19,524
Seems rike no one
takes me seriousry

657
00:53:20,172 --> 00:53:21,651
And so

658
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:24,286
I'm ronery

659
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:27,123
A rittle ronery

660
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:32,004
Poor rittle me

661
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:41,482
There's nobody I can rerate to

662
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:45,208
Feel rike a bird in a cage

663
00:53:45,412 --> 00:53:48,643
It's kind of sirry
But not rearry

664
00:53:49,212 --> 00:53:53,091
Because it's firring my body
with rage

665
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:58,002
I'm the smartest, most crever,
most physicarry fit

666
00:53:58,252 --> 00:54:01,324
But nobody else seems to rearise it

667
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:07,641
When I change the world
maybe they'll notice me

668
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:09,251
And until then

669
00:54:09,452 --> 00:54:12,091
I'll just be ronery

670
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:15,805
Yeah, a rittle ronery

671
00:54:16,012 --> 00:54:20,802
Poor rittle me

672
00:54:24,532 --> 00:54:30,323
I'm so ronery

673
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:48,490
What would you do

674
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:53,083
If you were asked to give up
your dreams for freedom?

675
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:57,122
What would you do if asked
to make the ultimate sacrifice?

676
00:54:57,332 --> 00:55:00,085
Hey, weren't you the actor
in that Broadway show?

677
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:04,365
Hey, yeah, it is you. Do that scene
where everyone gets AIDS.

678
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:08,087
I don't act anymore.
I gave that up.

679
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:11,523
- Oh, come on, man, just a scene.
- I said, get away from me!

680
00:55:11,732 --> 00:55:15,247
I'm completely lost.
I've hit rock bottom.

681
00:55:15,452 --> 00:55:18,250
Easy, easy.
You gotta calm down there, Chuck.

682
00:55:18,452 --> 00:55:21,444
I hurt people. I'm a dick.

683
00:55:21,692 --> 00:55:24,001
Well, being a dick ain't so bad.

684
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:25,685
See, there are three kinds of people:

685
00:55:25,892 --> 00:55:28,247
Dicks, pussies and assholes.

686
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,928
Pussies think everyone can get along
and dicks just wanna fuck all the time

687
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:33,531
without thinking it through.

688
00:55:33,732 --> 00:55:35,927
But then you got your assholes,
Chuck.

689
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,169
And all the assholes want
is to shit all over everything.

690
00:55:39,932 --> 00:55:42,366
So pussies may get mad at dicks
once in a while

691
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,086
because pussies
get fucked by dicks.

692
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:48,762
But dicks also fuck assholes, Chuck.

693
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,401
And if they didn't fuck the assholes,
you know what you'd get?

694
00:55:51,612 --> 00:55:55,207
You'd get your dick and your pussy
all covered in shit.

695
00:55:56,692 --> 00:55:59,252
All right, that does it.
Get out of here, you drunk lowlife.

696
00:56:06,252 --> 00:56:07,890
Get out of here, I said.

697
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:17,884
Lisa!

698
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:22,002
Lisa. Lisa, are you here?

699
00:56:24,332 --> 00:56:26,527
Get out of the street,
you fucking bum!

700
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:34,291
You gave up on life, didn't you?

701
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:57,409
My fellow actors,
we live in a dark time.

702
00:57:57,652 --> 00:57:59,722
The world is becoming more
and more violent

703
00:57:59,932 --> 00:58:01,923
and the idiots in charge
are making it worse.

704
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:06,404
What the world needs is
an international advisory committee

705
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:08,722
who truly understands global politics.

706
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:11,162
Namely, us.

707
00:58:13,852 --> 00:58:16,082
The time has come for us
to start using our acting talents

708
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,327
in a different way.

709
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:21,685
Yes, we can use our powers
to change the world.

710
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:27,289
We will persuade everyone
to drive hybrid cars and stop smoking.

711
00:58:27,732 --> 00:58:29,927
If we focus our acting
on global politics,

712
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,521
we can change everything and stuff.

713
00:58:35,652 --> 00:58:39,122
As actors, it is our responsibility
to read the newspapers

714
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:43,450
and then say what we read
on television like it's our own opinion.

715
00:58:43,692 --> 00:58:45,762
Matt Damon.

716
00:58:46,012 --> 00:58:47,286
We've all done action films.

717
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:50,006
If anyone tries to get in our way,
we'll show them just how tough

718
00:58:50,212 --> 00:58:52,043
us actors really are.

719
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,729
I'm glad you all agree.

720
00:58:57,932 --> 00:59:01,686
Because I've just been contacted
by a very important political leader

721
00:59:01,892 --> 00:59:04,281
who is bringing all the
world leaders together

722
00:59:04,532 --> 00:59:07,365
for a massive
international peace conference.

723
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:11,685
And he wants us to be
the keynote speakers.

724
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:15,649
Matt Damon!

725
00:59:17,372 --> 00:59:19,840
Say hello to our new partner.

726
00:59:20,652 --> 00:59:22,768
Herro.

727
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:32,488
Stop it! Stop it, you're killing him!

728
00:59:34,932 --> 00:59:36,923
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

729
00:59:37,132 --> 00:59:42,525
You're not in a position to kill anyone,
my red, white and brue friend.

730
00:59:42,892 --> 00:59:46,362
So you're the bastard
planning 9/11 times 1,000.

731
00:59:46,612 --> 00:59:49,080
No. You think so small.

732
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:53,126
You see, I'm about to have
an eraborate peace ceremony.

733
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:57,365
And while all the world's most
important people are distracted here,

734
00:59:57,572 --> 00:59:59,563
I will detonate the WMDs

735
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:03,890
which I have given to terrorists
arr around the grobe.

736
01:00:04,652 --> 01:00:10,682
It will be 9/11 times 2,356.

737
01:00:10,932 --> 01:00:14,561
My God, that's...
I don't even know what that is.

738
01:00:15,372 --> 01:00:17,363
Nobody does.

739
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:19,967
You heartless bastard.
Why would you do such a thing?

740
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:22,203
Because then there will be barance.

741
01:00:22,412 --> 01:00:24,846
Every country will be
a Third World country.

742
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:26,889
Just imagine it.

743
01:00:27,092 --> 01:00:30,209
All around the world, there will be
massive exprosions.

744
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:31,726
With nobody to guide them,

745
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:35,845
the people will break out into panic
and rioting all over the earth.

746
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:39,044
The true nature of humanity
is unreashed.

747
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:41,766
Dog eats dog,
as everyone attacks everyone

748
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,088
and fends only for themselves.

749
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:46,681
Grobal stabirity unravels.

750
01:00:46,892 --> 01:00:51,682
By the time my show is over,
it will be far too rate.

751
01:00:58,052 --> 01:00:59,451
Your plan will fail.

752
01:00:59,692 --> 01:01:02,650
You'll never keep the world leaders
distracted here for nine hours.

753
01:01:02,852 --> 01:01:07,642
Oh, no? I've got Arec Barrwin.

754
01:01:07,892 --> 01:01:09,644
Dear God.

755
01:01:09,852 --> 01:01:14,846
You are the rast of a dying breed,
the frag-waving American.

756
01:01:15,052 --> 01:01:18,169
Well, your rittle dream
will soon be over.

757
01:01:19,252 --> 01:01:21,641
I must get back to pranning
the ceremony now.

758
01:01:21,892 --> 01:01:24,167
The film actors are on their way.

759
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:28,206
Perhaps they'll stop in and say herro.

760
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:33,886
Having so little faith in humanity
must make you a very lonely man.

761
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:43,566
You shall have a front-row seat.

762
01:01:43,772 --> 01:01:45,603
Bring her upstairs.

763
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:48,007
Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch!

764
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:51,483
Lisa, I treasure your friendship!

765
01:01:52,572 --> 01:01:55,450
Somebody has to stop this!

766
01:02:02,092 --> 01:02:06,529
I miss you more than Michael Bay
missed the mark

767
01:02:06,732 --> 01:02:09,405
when he made Pearl Harbor

768
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:14,447
I miss you more than that movie
missed the point

769
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:18,361
And that's an awful lot, girl
And now

770
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:21,564
Now you've gone away

771
01:02:22,132 --> 01:02:24,646
And all I'm trying to say

772
01:02:24,852 --> 01:02:27,650
Is Pearl Harbor sucked

773
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:31,447
And I miss you

774
01:02:33,372 --> 01:02:38,048
I need you like Ben Affleck
needs acting school

775
01:02:38,252 --> 01:02:41,289
He was terrible in that film

776
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:45,849
I need you like Cuba Gooding
needed a bigger part

777
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:49,840
He's way better than Ben Affleck
And now

778
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:53,488
All I can think about is your smile

779
01:02:53,692 --> 01:02:56,604
and that shitty movie too

780
01:02:56,852 --> 01:02:59,047
Pearl Harbor sucked

781
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:02,528
And I miss you

782
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,211
Pearl Harbor sucked

783
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:14,451
Just a little bit more
than I miss you

784
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:18,211
Oh, my God.
What the hell happened?

785
01:03:37,212 --> 01:03:39,885
Hello? Anybody?

786
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:44,964
Greetings, Mr Johnston.

787
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:47,123
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.,
what the hell happened?

788
01:03:47,372 --> 01:03:51,001
Our base was attacked by
a giant socialist weasel.

789
01:03:51,212 --> 01:03:52,850
But where's the team?

790
01:03:53,052 --> 01:03:56,840
They have been taken prisoner
by Kim Jong II in North Korea.

791
01:03:57,052 --> 01:03:59,964
I have intercepted communications
that he is planning

792
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:03,005
the massive attack
during a peace ceremony.

793
01:04:03,212 --> 01:04:06,488
Don't move, protester,
or I'll blow your commie brains out.

794
01:04:06,732 --> 01:04:09,371
- Spottswoode.
- Johnston?

795
01:04:09,572 --> 01:04:10,925
What the hell are you doing here?

796
01:04:11,132 --> 01:04:12,531
Get away from
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

797
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:14,404
I'm using it to blow up North Korea.

798
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:16,728
No! The team is in North Korea.

799
01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:21,250
I know. And so are the triggers
to WMDs poised all around the globe.

800
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:23,448
My only option now
is to blow up Kim Jong II

801
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:26,007
and everything around him
before he can set them off.

802
01:04:26,212 --> 01:04:28,931
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., initiate
detonation sequence on the ships.

803
01:04:29,172 --> 01:04:30,525
You'll kill them all.

804
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:32,649
It's what they would
want me to do, Gary.

805
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:35,207
They would happily give their lives
for the good of the world,

806
01:04:35,412 --> 01:04:38,245
- something you don't understand!
- There has to be another way.

807
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:41,290
There's nobody left
to stop Kim Jong II.

808
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:43,084
Let me go.

809
01:04:44,132 --> 01:04:46,885
You? You're a buttfucking quitter.

810
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,560
You walked out, Gary. The team went
on a mission without you.

811
01:04:49,772 --> 01:04:52,002
And without an actor,
they were like pigs to the slaughter.

812
01:04:52,212 --> 01:04:54,407
I'm supposed to leave
the fate of the world in your hands?

813
01:04:54,612 --> 01:04:57,080
I know I walked out,
but I'd do anything to take it back.

814
01:04:57,292 --> 01:05:00,329
- Please, just let me help.
- You've done enough.

815
01:05:00,532 --> 01:05:03,524
Please, Spottswoode,
you have to believe in me.

816
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:09,360
I want to believe in you, Gary,
I really do.

817
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,961
But you've let me down before.

818
01:05:12,292 --> 01:05:15,409
Please, how can I make you
trust me?

819
01:05:17,132 --> 01:05:19,566
I remember the first time we met.

820
01:05:19,772 --> 01:05:22,445
You were a simple Broadway actor
afraid to get in my limo

821
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,724
because you thought I wanted you
to perform oral sex on me.

822
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:27,923
Do you remember that?

823
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,963
Yeah.

824
01:05:30,172 --> 01:05:35,246
And now the tables are turned,
and I don't know if I can trust you.

825
01:05:36,612 --> 01:05:39,410
Just give me a chance.

826
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:45,281
All right, I'll trust you.

827
01:05:45,972 --> 01:05:47,803
But only if you...

828
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:50,845
...will perform oral sex on me.

829
01:05:52,332 --> 01:05:55,369
- What?
- Right here, right now.

830
01:05:57,572 --> 01:06:00,450
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, I am serious.

831
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:04,361
Look, this is my serious face.

832
01:06:05,812 --> 01:06:08,280
- What will that prove?
- It will prove that you are truly ready

833
01:06:08,492 --> 01:06:09,607
to lay everything on the line.

834
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:11,928
To throw away all your inhibitions
and give 100 percent.

835
01:06:12,132 --> 01:06:14,805
We must go back to that first night
we met, that first issue of trust.

836
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,572
- Don't you see?
- No. I thought you weren't gay.

837
01:06:17,812 --> 01:06:20,042
This isn't about sex, Gary,
it's about trust.

838
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:24,006
It's the eye of the needle, Gary,
and we must both pass through it.

839
01:06:28,012 --> 01:06:29,968
Okay, let's do it.

840
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:34,488
I'll make sure nobody's watching.

841
01:06:34,692 --> 01:06:36,569
Yeah, it looks clear.

842
01:06:36,772 --> 01:06:38,649
Okay, go.

843
01:06:40,172 --> 01:06:41,685
There must be another way.

844
01:06:42,412 --> 01:06:45,210
I guess you won't do everything
to take it all back, will you, Gary?

845
01:06:45,452 --> 01:06:47,488
No, no, no. Wait, wait, hold on.

846
01:06:47,692 --> 01:06:52,288
You're saying if I do that,
you'll let me help the team?

847
01:06:52,532 --> 01:06:55,490
I'll give you all the time I can.

848
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:00,492
Okay, let's do it.

849
01:07:00,692 --> 01:07:02,364
Here we go.

850
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:04,608
And go.

851
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,600
You are dedicated.

852
01:07:34,852 --> 01:07:36,205
Now, let's go get cleaned up.

853
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,807
If you're going to storm Kim Jong ll's
palace single-handed,

854
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:41,845
we have to make you
a complete soldier in very little time.

855
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:44,444
How we gonna do that?

856
01:07:44,692 --> 01:07:48,526
I think I know just what we need.

857
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:54,371
The hour's approaching
to give it your best

858
01:07:54,572 --> 01:07:57,803
and you've got to reach your prime

859
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:00,446
That's when you need
to put yourself to the test

860
01:08:00,652 --> 01:08:02,882
and show us a passage of time

861
01:08:03,092 --> 01:08:06,528
- We're gonna need a montage
- Montage

862
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:09,969
- It takes a montage
- Montage

863
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,567
Show a lot of things
happening at once

864
01:08:12,772 --> 01:08:15,491
Remind everyone
of what's going on

865
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:18,889
And with every shot
show a little improvement

866
01:08:19,092 --> 01:08:21,242
to show it all would take too long

867
01:08:21,452 --> 01:08:24,410
- That's called a montage
- Montage

868
01:08:24,612 --> 01:08:28,002
- Girl, we want a montage
- Montage

869
01:08:28,212 --> 01:08:30,965
In anything, if you want to go

870
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:33,606
From just a beginner to a pro

871
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:36,326
- You need a montage
- Montage

872
01:08:36,532 --> 01:08:40,571
- Even Rocky had a montage
- Montage

873
01:08:41,252 --> 01:08:45,882
- Always fade out in a montage
- Montage

874
01:08:46,092 --> 01:08:49,607
If you fade out
it seems like more time has passed

875
01:08:49,812 --> 01:08:52,724
- In a montage
- Montage

876
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:04,290
Radies and gentlemen.

877
01:09:04,492 --> 01:09:08,565
The Film Actors Guild and Kim Jong II
are preased to welcome you

878
01:09:08,772 --> 01:09:13,971
to the International
World Peace Ceremony.

879
01:09:14,172 --> 01:09:16,766
The most important people
from every country

880
01:09:16,972 --> 01:09:21,124
are gathered here in soridarity
to cerebrate peace.

881
01:09:21,332 --> 01:09:23,846
There will be music, dancing
and, of course,

882
01:09:24,052 --> 01:09:26,327
the biggest stars in Horrywood.

883
01:09:26,572 --> 01:09:30,485
In the box to your reft is the
mastermind of this spectacurar show,

884
01:09:30,732 --> 01:09:34,645
the multitarented Kim Jong II.

885
01:09:34,852 --> 01:09:37,241
Oh, herro.

886
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:43,290
And now we present to you
the very best in North Korean music.

887
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:04,083
Ten years of pranning,
and finarry the night is here.

888
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:07,887
The terrorists know to be in position by
the time Arec Barrwin takes the stage.

889
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:12,046
That's when I trigger all the WMDs
to go off at the same time.

890
01:10:12,252 --> 01:10:14,049
When you see Arec Barrwin,

891
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:18,484
you will see the true ugriness
of human nature.

892
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:21,724
Your plan will never work.
Something will stop it.

893
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:25,166
You stupid, naive Team Americans.

894
01:10:25,372 --> 01:10:27,408
You berieve in true rove
and happy endings

895
01:10:27,612 --> 01:10:30,410
even while the world around you
spirals downward.

896
01:10:31,412 --> 01:10:35,769
Sometimes believing is all we have.

897
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:40,084
And as the leaders of your countries,
you have the power

898
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:45,571
to bring the world together under
the principles of the Film Actors Guild.

899
01:10:45,812 --> 01:10:47,643
You're gonna
knock them dead, Alec.

900
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:51,206
Ten minutes, Mr Baldwin.

901
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:02,410
Who the hell you?

902
01:11:02,652 --> 01:11:05,883
I'm with the Film Actors Guild.
I'm here to help with the broadcast.

903
01:11:06,132 --> 01:11:07,326
Then you show credentials.

904
01:11:07,532 --> 01:11:09,284
Hey, you don't need to see
my credentials.

905
01:11:09,492 --> 01:11:12,211
I left them at home
and I'm running late.

906
01:11:12,452 --> 01:11:14,443
- I berieve him.
- Yeah, me too.

907
01:11:15,652 --> 01:11:17,131
Okay, have a nice day.

908
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:20,125
My God, his acting is better
than ever.

909
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:37,924
Don't worry, fellas,
I've got my pass right here.

910
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:49,360
Please, Mr Sheen, Mr Robbins,

911
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:51,881
you don't understand
what Kim Jong II is doing.

912
01:11:52,132 --> 01:11:55,647
Shut up. We have explicit instructions
to watch you.

913
01:11:55,892 --> 01:11:58,725
- Yeah. We're supposed to be guards.
- We're guards.

914
01:11:58,972 --> 01:12:02,408
- We're guards, huh? We're guards.
- We're guards.

915
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,371
Mr Sheen, Mr Robbins. Someone
has broken into the main hall.

916
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:08,291
What? Come on, Martin!

917
01:12:18,012 --> 01:12:20,480
- Gary?
- What the fuck are you doing here?

918
01:12:20,692 --> 01:12:23,081
Guys, are you all right?
Where's Lisa?

919
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:25,766
What the heck do you care?
You walked out on her.

920
01:12:26,012 --> 01:12:27,365
Look, I wanna make things right.

921
01:12:27,612 --> 01:12:29,091
Here, Spottswoode's monitoring
from the base.

922
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:32,210
- Spottswoode is dead, Gary.
- Not as dead as you think.

923
01:12:32,412 --> 01:12:35,324
- Spottswoode!
- Yes, I'm here, Joe.

924
01:12:35,572 --> 01:12:38,769
- All right, you're alive!
- Great to hear your voices again.

925
01:12:38,972 --> 01:12:41,611
Now we've got to get Lisa
and stop Kim Jong II.

926
01:12:41,852 --> 01:12:43,763
I'm not going anywhere
with this fucking traitor.

927
01:12:44,012 --> 01:12:45,730
What makes you think
we'll take you back, douchebag?

928
01:12:45,972 --> 01:12:48,327
- We're doing this without you!
- Now, hold on, team.

929
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,806
Gary has already proven to me

930
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:52,287
that he is 100 percent committed
to the team.

931
01:12:52,532 --> 01:12:55,922
He proved it last night
by sucking my cock.

932
01:12:59,332 --> 01:13:01,721
All right. Come on, team,
we gotta find that stage.

933
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:07,049
Rook how much they rove my show.
The entire audience is so captivated.

934
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:17,849
And now you see,
the new world is inevitabre.

935
01:13:18,052 --> 01:13:21,249
- It's what?
- Inevita... Inevitabre.

936
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:23,204
- One more time.
- Inevitabre!

937
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:25,801
Things are inevitabry
going to change.

938
01:13:26,012 --> 01:13:28,651
Goddamn it, open your fucking ears.

939
01:13:30,692 --> 01:13:32,842
- Five minutes, Mr Baldwin.
- Thank you.

940
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:36,880
- Alec, we have a problem.
- Team America escaped.

941
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:40,206
What? You fools.
They'll ruin everything.

942
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:42,880
We better warn everyone.
They'll be headed here.

943
01:13:43,092 --> 01:13:45,890
No. We can't look weak
and powerless.

944
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:49,209
If violence is all those bastards
understand, then violence they'll get.

945
01:13:49,412 --> 01:13:51,368
Every actor, grab a gun
and keep Team America

946
01:13:51,572 --> 01:13:54,291
from reaching this ceremony
at all costs.

947
01:13:54,612 --> 01:13:56,523
Qapla!

948
01:13:56,772 --> 01:13:58,444
Qapla!

949
01:13:58,692 --> 01:14:01,843
I swear they won't reach this stage.

950
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:20,210
Jesus! What have we got?

951
01:14:20,452 --> 01:14:23,205
Looks like George Clooney
and Liv Tyler, 20 yards.

952
01:14:24,892 --> 01:14:26,883
Look out, it's Ethan Hawke
and Janeane Garofalo.

953
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:34,611
Drop your weapons.

954
01:14:35,132 --> 01:14:36,531
Fucking die!

955
01:14:38,452 --> 01:14:39,521
We gotta split up.

956
01:14:39,772 --> 01:14:42,047
Sarah, you and Gary go that way.
Chris and I will go right.

957
01:14:42,252 --> 01:14:45,483
No, I think I'd rather team up
with you, Joe.

958
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:49,441
I guess you're with me, cockfag.

959
01:14:51,372 --> 01:14:52,521
- Danny Glover!
- Come on, Penn.

960
01:14:52,732 --> 01:14:55,565
- We must protect the show.
- Right.

961
01:14:56,172 --> 01:14:58,845
- The stage must be that way.
- No. Joe, Sarah, it's a trap!

962
01:15:05,012 --> 01:15:06,570
Very impressive, warmongers.

963
01:15:06,772 --> 01:15:10,208
Now let's see how Kim Jong ll's
panthers treat you.

964
01:15:13,892 --> 01:15:15,644
I went to Iraq, you know!

965
01:15:21,532 --> 01:15:23,887
- Susan Sarandon.
- Oh, thank God.

966
01:15:24,092 --> 01:15:26,526
We have to stop the ceremony.
Kim Jong II is mad.

967
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:28,962
Here, let me loose.
I'll show you where the theatre is.

968
01:15:29,212 --> 01:15:31,680
- All right.
- No, Chris, stay away from her.

969
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:36,084
- Fuck you. She wants to help us.
- No, Chris, she's acting.

970
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,570
I am not. The others tied me up

971
01:15:38,772 --> 01:15:40,842
because I wouldn't go along
with their plans.

972
01:15:41,092 --> 01:15:43,401
Your skills are fading with age,
Miss Sarandon.

973
01:15:44,972 --> 01:15:47,167
You shall die a peasant's death!

974
01:15:56,492 --> 01:15:57,686
Jesus titty-fucking Christ.

975
01:15:57,892 --> 01:16:00,486
I could've sworn
she was telling the truth.

976
01:16:00,732 --> 01:16:04,247
That's why they call it acting.
Come on, we gotta find Lisa.

977
01:16:04,452 --> 01:16:08,127
I was 19 years old when
the musical Cats came to our town.

978
01:16:08,692 --> 01:16:10,330
I couldn't wait to see it.

979
01:16:11,452 --> 01:16:13,568
After the show, I was asked
if I wanted to go meet

980
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:17,401
some of the performers backstage.
Man, I was thrilled.

981
01:16:17,612 --> 01:16:21,924
But when I got back there,
they were drunk and out of control.

982
01:16:22,132 --> 01:16:25,568
Rumpus cat and Macavity
kept feeling up my leg.

983
01:16:25,812 --> 01:16:29,407
I tried to leave, but Rumpleteazer
held me down and...

984
01:16:30,492 --> 01:16:33,689
...I was raped by Mr Mistoffelees.

985
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:39,282
That's why you don't trust actors.

986
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:45,048
I'm sorry I've been so hard on you.

987
01:16:45,252 --> 01:16:47,686
If there's still a world left
when this is all over,

988
01:16:47,932 --> 01:16:49,650
I'd like to buy you a beer.

989
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:54,283
Come on, let's go.
We're running out of time.

990
01:16:58,852 --> 01:17:02,561
Sarah, before we die, I want to
finally tell you that I love you.

991
01:17:03,732 --> 01:17:07,520
No. No, I'm not gonna
let it end like this.

992
01:17:07,732 --> 01:17:11,486
We are not your enemy, furry ones.
You will not attack us.

993
01:17:11,732 --> 01:17:15,407
Sarah, that isn't going to work.
You don't really have mental powers.

994
01:17:15,652 --> 01:17:19,167
Your captors are behind you, Shebas.
Show your anger to them.

995
01:17:39,852 --> 01:17:41,410
Sarah, you did it!

996
01:17:44,732 --> 01:17:45,926
Wait. Hold on.

997
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:49,761
Spottswoode, I think we just found
the entrance to the theatre.

998
01:17:49,972 --> 01:17:51,610
Have Sarah and Joe lock on to our...

999
01:17:52,612 --> 01:17:54,125
Gary!

1000
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:57,526
- Actors, ho!
- Helen Hunt.

1001
01:17:57,732 --> 01:17:59,643
Samuel Jackson.

1002
01:17:59,852 --> 01:18:01,843
Matt Damon.

1003
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:05,010
Motherfucker.

1004
01:18:06,172 --> 01:18:07,241
Gary, Chris, come in.

1005
01:18:09,972 --> 01:18:14,443
And now, radies and gentlemen,
Mr Arec Barrwin.

1006
01:18:25,772 --> 01:18:28,730
We are here to usher in a new era
without violence.

1007
01:18:28,972 --> 01:18:31,167
By following the rules
of the Film Actors Guild,

1008
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:33,363
the world can become a better place

1009
01:18:33,572 --> 01:18:37,485
that handles dangerous people
with talk and reasoning.

1010
01:18:37,732 --> 01:18:41,008
That is the F.A.G. Way.

1011
01:18:41,212 --> 01:18:45,125
One day you'll all look at the world
us actors created and say,

1012
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:48,887
"Wow. Good going, F.A.G.

1013
01:18:49,132 --> 01:18:53,125
You really made the world
a better place, didn't you, F.A.G?"

1014
01:18:53,372 --> 01:18:57,570
Yes, Arec Barrwin. Too bad
there won't be a world reft.

1015
01:18:57,812 --> 01:18:59,450
Oh, God, no.

1016
01:18:59,692 --> 01:19:04,083
You see? No Prince Charming rode in
on a white stallion to save the day.

1017
01:19:04,692 --> 01:19:06,887
This is the real world.

1018
01:19:07,092 --> 01:19:09,845
I'm afraid your world is over.

1019
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:12,651
In five minutes.

1020
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:18,490
Yes, the ticking crock.

1021
01:19:20,092 --> 01:19:24,324
Sorry, Team America, but you see,
we must live in a time of peace.

1022
01:19:24,532 --> 01:19:27,205
Put down the gas can now.

1023
01:19:27,452 --> 01:19:29,044
Kill them.

1024
01:19:33,012 --> 01:19:34,525
Jackson!

1025
01:19:36,932 --> 01:19:38,445
Team, you've got to hurry.

1026
01:19:44,172 --> 01:19:46,686
Let's go, bitch.
I've done action films.

1027
01:19:46,932 --> 01:19:48,411
Come on.

1028
01:20:09,732 --> 01:20:10,721
Matt Damon!

1029
01:20:21,612 --> 01:20:23,887
Come on, stop trying to hit me
and hit me.

1030
01:20:30,412 --> 01:20:32,289
Don't fucking move!

1031
01:20:32,972 --> 01:20:34,724
Now, isn't that a shame.

1032
01:20:34,932 --> 01:20:36,604
You came so close
to stopping peace.

1033
01:20:36,812 --> 01:20:39,929
But you see,
peace always finds a way.

1034
01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:42,003
Goodbye, Team America.

1035
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,851
I've just got one piece of bad news
for you, Robbins.

1036
01:20:45,212 --> 01:20:48,648
- What's that?
- I'm a smoker.

1037
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:08,528
Now that the world
is going to be run peacefully,

1038
01:21:08,732 --> 01:21:10,211
we should all drive hybrid cars.

1039
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,721
Right now famiries
are gathering in parks,

1040
01:21:12,972 --> 01:21:16,123
children are walking to school,
friends are sitting in movie theatres.

1041
01:21:16,332 --> 01:21:20,769
All compretery unaware that the world
is about to change forever.

1042
01:21:21,012 --> 01:21:22,923
All because of me.

1043
01:21:25,252 --> 01:21:26,731
Stop that man.

1044
01:21:28,572 --> 01:21:30,005
Gary!

1045
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:32,925
- Team America?
- Goddamn it.

1046
01:21:33,172 --> 01:21:35,208
Sorry to interrupt the show,
everyone, but Kim Jong II

1047
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:37,482
is an international criminal.
We're here to arrest him.

1048
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,444
Oh, no, you're not.

1049
01:21:39,692 --> 01:21:41,125
This is a peace conference.

1050
01:21:41,492 --> 01:21:44,052
And if you even try to touch
Kim Jong II,

1051
01:21:44,252 --> 01:21:47,847
this audience and I will rise up
against you.

1052
01:21:50,012 --> 01:21:51,684
Fuck off, Team America!

1053
01:21:51,892 --> 01:21:54,167
Team, there's no time.
You have to convince that audience

1054
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:56,647
to let you do your job.

1055
01:21:58,012 --> 01:22:02,164
- Gary, you've got to take the stage.
- No. I can't upstage Alec Baldwin.

1056
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:05,006
- He's the best actor in the world.
- You have to try.

1057
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:08,010
- I'm not that good.
- Actually...

1058
01:22:08,492 --> 01:22:11,882
...you're the finest actor
I've ever met.

1059
01:22:19,012 --> 01:22:21,651
Come on, Gary, hurry.
You've got to act fast.

1060
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:28,485
I know you all don't like Team America
a whole lot right now, but...

1061
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:31,207
Kim Jong II is a lot worse.

1062
01:22:34,612 --> 01:22:37,001
You can't outact me, boy.
Don't even try.

1063
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:42,362
For the truth is that Team America
fights for the billion-dollar corporations.

1064
01:22:42,612 --> 01:22:47,732
They are just as bad
as the enemies they fight.

1065
01:22:50,372 --> 01:22:54,126
Oh, no, we aren't. We're dicks!

1066
01:22:57,772 --> 01:23:00,684
We're reckless, arrogant,
stupid dicks.

1067
01:23:02,572 --> 01:23:06,451
And the Film Actors Guild
are pussies.

1068
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:11,242
And Kim Jong II is an asshole.

1069
01:23:13,892 --> 01:23:18,124
Pussies don't like dicks,
because pussies get fucked by dicks.

1070
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:22,041
But dicks also fuck assholes,

1071
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:25,648
assholes who just wanna shit
on everything.

1072
01:23:25,852 --> 01:23:29,049
Pussies may think they can deal
with assholes their way.

1073
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:31,283
But the only thing
that can fuck an asshole

1074
01:23:31,492 --> 01:23:34,564
is a dick with some balls.

1075
01:23:37,732 --> 01:23:41,202
The problem with dicks
is that sometimes they fuck too much.

1076
01:23:41,452 --> 01:23:45,764
- Or fuck when it isn't appropriate.
- Yes, Gary, yes.

1077
01:23:46,052 --> 01:23:48,964
And it takes a pussy
to show them that.

1078
01:23:49,212 --> 01:23:51,282
But sometimes pussies
get so full of shit

1079
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:54,126
that they become assholes
themselves.

1080
01:23:54,372 --> 01:23:57,444
Because pussies are only an
inch and a half away from assholes.

1081
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:02,762
I don't know much
in this crazy, crazy world...

1082
01:24:02,972 --> 01:24:08,444
...but I do know that if you don't
let us fuck this asshole...

1083
01:24:08,652 --> 01:24:11,928
...we are gonna have our dicks
and our pussies...

1084
01:24:12,132 --> 01:24:15,010
...all covered in shit.

1085
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:32,651
Show us what you're doing,
Kim Jong II.

1086
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:36,769
Do something, Arec Barrwin!

1087
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:40,960
The... Global warming and...
Corporate America...

1088
01:24:43,332 --> 01:24:45,163
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin.

1089
01:24:55,052 --> 01:24:58,283
Don't fucking move!
You were all going to be treated

1090
01:24:58,532 --> 01:25:00,204
to a faburous show.
But now party's over.

1091
01:25:00,452 --> 01:25:02,522
- For I am the great Kim Jong II.
- Lisa.

1092
01:25:02,772 --> 01:25:06,321
And I am the greatest terrorist
ever to have rived.

1093
01:25:06,572 --> 01:25:08,244
Terrorise this.

1094
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,283
- Lisa, are you okay?
- No, Gary, the countdown.

1095
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:26,971
You have to stop it.

1096
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:30,164
- What do I do?
- Hit the big "cancel" button!

1097
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:39,127
- Gary, how did you manage this?
- Spottswoode helped me.

1098
01:25:39,332 --> 01:25:40,970
Spottswoode? He's alive?

1099
01:25:41,212 --> 01:25:44,807
Lisa, I'm crazy about you.
Will you please forgive me if l...?

1100
01:25:45,052 --> 01:25:48,488
You had me at
"dicks fuck assholes."

1101
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:51,405
Attention. Attention, everyone.

1102
01:25:51,612 --> 01:25:53,967
All you in the audience should go
to your homes now.

1103
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:56,851
Your countries need you.
But the world will be safe,

1104
01:25:57,052 --> 01:26:00,806
thanks to a brilliant actor
named Gary Johnston.

1105
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:22,322
Let me explain to you
the kind of man Gary is.

1106
01:26:22,532 --> 01:26:23,521
He's a man who knows

1107
01:26:23,732 --> 01:26:26,929
that when you put another man's cock
in your mouth, you make a pact.

1108
01:26:27,172 --> 01:26:28,446
A bond that cannot be broken.

1109
01:26:29,092 --> 01:26:31,890
He's a man so dedicated that
he will get down on his knees

1110
01:26:32,092 --> 01:26:33,969
and put that cock
right in his mouth.

1111
01:26:36,612 --> 01:26:38,250
Wait a minute. Look!

1112
01:26:43,092 --> 01:26:46,050
You have not heard the rast
of Kim Jong II.

1113
01:26:46,252 --> 01:26:48,288
I will return!

1114
01:26:49,092 --> 01:26:53,244
You shall see. I will be back!

1115
01:26:58,692 --> 01:27:01,525
So rong, earthrings!

1116
01:27:03,012 --> 01:27:05,606
We'll be here waiting for you,
Kim Jong II.

1117
01:27:05,812 --> 01:27:08,167
All right, you guys, I hate to break up
this little party,

1118
01:27:08,372 --> 01:27:10,090
but there's still a lot of bad guys
out there.

1119
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:14,365
Well, then let's go show the bad guys
the police are back in force.

1120
01:27:14,612 --> 01:27:16,125
Fuck, yeah.

1121
01:27:16,372 --> 01:27:18,090
Fuck, yeah.

1122
01:27:19,012 --> 01:27:21,924

1124
01:27:25,252 --> 01:27:28,164
America
Fuck, yeah

1125
01:27:28,412 --> 01:27:30,880
Coming again to save
The motherfucking day, yeah

America
Fuck, yeah

Freedom is the only way
Yeah

1128
01:27:36,532 --> 01:27:38,841
Terrorists, your game is through

1129
01:27:39,052 --> 01:27:41,771
'Cause now you have to answer to

1130
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:44,128

America
Fuck, yeah

What you gonna do
When we come for you now?

1134
01:27:53,772 --> 01:27:56,240
It's the dream that we all share

1135
01:27:56,452 --> 01:28:01,082
- It's the hope for tomorrow
- Fuck, yeah

1136

- My grandma and my dog Ole Blue

01:28:32,452 --> 01:28:33,407
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

1150
01:28:33,612 --> 01:28:35,045
We're gonna break down
These barricades

1151
01:28:35,252 --> 01:28:37,368
Everyone has

AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

1154
01:28:42,092 --> 01:28:44,652
Freedom isn't free

1155
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:48,242
It costs folks like you and me

1156
01:28:48,452 --> 01:28:55,369
And if we don't all chip in
We'll never pay that bill

1157
01:28:56,532 --> 01:28:59,205
Freedom isn't free

1158
01:28:59,412 --> 01:29:02,882
No, there's a hefty fucking fee

1159
01:29:03,092 --> 01:29:06,767
And if you don't throw in
Your buck o'five

1160
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:09,770
Who will?

1161
01:29:10,932 --> 01:29:12,604
Buck o'five

1162
01:29:12,812 --> 01:29:17,727
Freedom costs a buck o'five

1163
01:29:18,652 --> 01:29:21,041
Only a woman

1164
01:29:21,252 --> 01:29:25,006
Can brighten up my day

1165
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:27,442
Only a woman

1166
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:31,645
Can touch me the right way
Yeah

1167
01:29:31,852 --> 01:29:33,888
Only a woman

01:29:34,092 --> 01:29:38,131
Is allowed to touch me there

1169
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:43,929

1178
01:30:17,652 --> 01:30:19,131
And so

1179
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:22,563
I'm ronery

1180
01:30:22,772 --> 01:30:25,047
A rittle ronery

1181
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:30,645
Poor rittle me

1182
01:30:40,492 --> 01:30:45,122
I need you like Ben Affleck
Needs acting school

1183
01:30:45,332 --> 01:30:48,324
He was terrible in that film

1184
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:52,969
I need you like Cuba Gooding
Needed a bigger part

1185
01:30:53,172 --> 01:30:56,926
He's way better than Ben Affleck
And now

1186
01:30:57,132 --> 01:31:03,401
All I can think about is your smile
And that shitty movie too

1187
01:31:03,612 --> 01:31:06,046
Pearl Harbor sucked

1188
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:10,450
And I miss you

1189
01:31:16,532 --> 01:31:22,562
Why does Michael Bay
Get to keep on making movies?

1190
01:31:22,772 --> 01:31:26,606
I guess Pearl Harbor sucked

1191
01:31:27,212 --> 01:31:32,764
Just a little bit more
Than I miss you

1192
01:31:39,492 --> 01:31:41,926
Show a lot of things
Happening at once

1193
01:31:42,132 --> 01:31:45,522
- Remind everyone of what's going on
- What's going on

1194
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:48,246
And with every shot
Show a little improvement

1195
01:31:48,452 --> 01:31:50,807
To show it all would take too long

1196
01:31:51,012 --> 01:31:53,765
- That's called a montage
- Montage

1197
01:31:53,972 --> 01:31:57,362
- Girl, we want a montage
- Montage

1198
01:31:57,572 --> 01:32:03,249
In anything, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro

1199
01:32:03,452 --> 01:32:05,727
- You need a montage
- Montage

1200
01:32:05,932 --> 01:32:09,971
- Even Rocky had a montage
- Montage

1201
01:32:10,172 --> 01:32:15,485
- Always fade out in a montage
- Montage

1202
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:18,252
If you fade out it seems like
More time has passed

1203
01:32:18,452 --> 01:32:22,331
I was sent from planet Gyron
To conquer the Earth

1204
01:32:22,532 --> 01:32:25,968
I had a terrific pran
I thought it would work

1205
01:32:26,172 --> 01:32:29,528
Tried to get the earthrings
All to kill each other, you see

1206
01:32:29,732 --> 01:32:33,850
But it all went wrong
And now I must decree

1207
01:32:34,052 --> 01:32:38,364
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin

1208
01:32:38,572 --> 01:32:42,247
You failed in every way
And now my stock in you has farren

1209
01:32:42,452 --> 01:32:45,762
Your career is starring
And you're worthress, Arec Barrwin

1210
01:32:45,972 --> 01:32:51,092
That's why I brew your head off
And your children are all bawring

1211
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:55,410
Pranet Gyron is inhabited
With Zypods rike me

1212
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:59,207
But also with Barmacks
Who are giant bees

1213
01:32:59,412 --> 01:33:02,848
The Zypods and the Barmacks
Are at constant war

1214
01:33:03,052 --> 01:33:07,364
So we wanted a new home
And that's what Earth was for

1215
01:33:07,572 --> 01:33:12,282
But you are worthress, Arec Barrwin
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin

1216
01:33:12,492 --> 01:33:13,845
You fucked up my whole pran

1217
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:16,771
And now Gyron is smeared
With Barmack porren

1218
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:20,521
Your garbage needs some hauring
And you're worthress, Arec Barrwin

1219
01:33:20,732 --> 01:33:23,804
Now I must return home a failure

1220
01:33:24,012 --> 01:33:30,008
I'm afraid the Pit of Cryrock
Is carring
