00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,045
Shizuoka, 1977

2
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:16,314
What's the situation?

3
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:20,015
The plane's damaged, no idea of survivor

4
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:25,993
3 hours after the crash, hard to survive

5
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:30,898
That's the worst scenario if all dead

6
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,068
(Help)

7
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,267
You hear that?

8
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:39,800
Yes, I heard it too. A child's voice

9
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:43,003
(Mommy, Daddy)

10
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:45,940
(Help me...)

11
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,753
(lt's so heavy, please move it away)

12
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,561
Here he is!

13
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,393
He's alive!

14
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,971
Headquarters, we've located one survivor

15
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,635
Send a rescue helicopter immediately!

16
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:18,272
You heard him screaming?

17
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,365
(Where's Mommy? Where's Daddy?)

18
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,691
(It's time to go home now)

19
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,773
That's not his voice

20
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,734
What...

21
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:48,173
That's his thoughts reaching our brains

22
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:49,674
Impossible

23
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,713
We have an emergency

24
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,213
Report to the General immediately

25
00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:00,188
Discovered one Transparent at crash site

26
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:05,291
Found a Transparent, request protection

27
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,063
A stretcher! Now!

31
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:33,889
You report to the Protection Committee

Prime Minister's Office, Tokyo, 2000

33
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:12,993
I'm Komatsu Yoko of #1 Support Regiment

34
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:16,099
#1 Division, Eastern Battalion

35
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:18,300
Welcome

36
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:22,835
I'm Kunimitsu, Chief of Escort Division

37
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,233
What about this female soldier

38
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,968
Awfully dainty

39
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:29,737
Has she got what it takes?

40
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:33,106
After Military Medical Institute,

41
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:38,720
She's been a staff psychiatrist

42
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,291
Yes, I'm making a clinical study of PTSD

43
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:46,726
for disorder, and counseling soldiers

44
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:48,129
Excellent

45
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,128
You should be familiar with Transparent?

46
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:56,763
Bulesis Transmission Disorder

47
00:05:56,874 --> 00:06:04,371
Inner thoughts expose to nearby peopl

48
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,409
Unfortunately, I've never met one

49
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:11,276
It is the mission of this Committee...

50
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,956
to protect and supervise Transparents

51
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:20,356
For years, being supported by government

52
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:25,398
We have promotion for Transparent

53
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:30,440
To enhance the public acceptance

54
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:40,375
Transparent's thoughts can reach 10m far

55
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,716
If you suddenly get another's thoughts

56
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:50,059
Don't panic, but react normally instead

57
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,197
Transparents are invaluable resources

58
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:10,906
don't reveal this knowledge to them

59
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:16,017
From the Specially Gifted Committee

60
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,622
Transparents never know their condition

61
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:22,214
Yes. When a Transparent discovers it

62
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,687
The psychological stress has sometimes...

63
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,059
...led to suicide. I know a case

64
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,927
Our first Transparent

65
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,995
A most unfortunate incident

66
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:41,107
Now, there are 7 Transparents in Japan

67
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,743
And their I.Q. are above 180

68
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:49,483
Look at this

69
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:02,294
#5, a genius on environment engineering

70
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,693
analyzed carbon dioxide with silicon

71
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:14,202
Reducing 5% in CO2 emissions mandated by

72
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:16,571
International Global Warming Guidelines

73
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:22,686
This increased our domestic GNP by 23%

74
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:28,181
Case #1, a genius on Quantum Physics

75
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:33,589
Case #4 proved the Hertz Moeler Theorem

76
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:37,629
Case #3 designed our 1st space station

77
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:44,799
All Transparents have great contribution

78
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:49,310
Some of them may seem of dubious value,

79
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:54,484
But Transparents are valuable resources

80
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:58,255
This is why our mission to protect...

81
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:01,850
and supervise Transparents

82
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:09,693
Transparents have been assigned to towns

83
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,962
Transparents live like average citizens

84
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:19,540
That's your new posting Where Case #7,

85
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:23,372
The 7th Transparent resides

86
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,577
We'll look forward to your reports

87
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:28,785
Yes

88
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,488
Case #7. His name is Satomi Kenichi

89
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,398
Born in 1973, he lost both his parents

90
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,732
In an airplane crash when he was 3

91
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:56,876
His grandma Satomi Kiyo lived in Okumino

92
00:09:57,314 --> 00:10:00,715
A town for Transparent Protection,

93
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,843
Kiyo was allowed to adopt him

94
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:11,761
Case #7, his first day of primary school

95
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,832
Kenichi, your lunch

96
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:26,599
Graduating with top grades in school

97
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:32,346
Want to be a doctor and took the exam

98
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,826
You may begin

99
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:53,799
Passing the test with top scores

100
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:58,139
He passed the Medical Boards 6 yrs later

101
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:04,471
Now, Kenichi sit here. Got to tell them

102
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,662
After his residency, Case #7 worked

103
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:26,028
as a young doctor at the Mino hospital

104
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,038
Make him give up medical practice?

105
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:32,739
Yes

106
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,168
But why?

107
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:40,648
This drug is for Athlete's foot

108
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,317
What does that...

109
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,544
I've used it personally

110
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:50,293
It was Case #7, who discovered...

111
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,559
this hit product during medical school

112
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:58,832
Given more time in a real research,

113
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:02,836
He might find cures for cancer or AIDS

114
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:05,635
Actually, he has to

115
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,143
So, Transparents are national resources

116
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:14,773
Why he quit research and be a doctor?

117
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,883
Under the Transparent Protection Act,

118
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:21,785
Transparent's wishes shall be respected

119
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:30,858
Therefore, we let him to become a doctor

120
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:37,405
We have to make him change his mind

121
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,066
So he can carry on researching new drugs

122
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:44,708
That's where you come into the picture

123
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:47,715
In other words, I get close to #7,

124
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,044
In order to discover exactly why

125
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,451
He wants to be a practicing doctor

126
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,622
Precisely

127
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,759
You are psychiatrist. We have confidence

128
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:08,729
Sir, I'm glad to study a Transparent

129
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:17,304
We land in Okumino in 5 minutes

130
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,440
What's it like?

131
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,580
No local specialties nor any hot springs

132
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:29,016
Otherwise, they'd never have volunteered

133
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:30,460
Volunteer for having a Transparent?

134
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:35,360
They take in one Transparent to cut tax

135
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:38,328
Suddenly, their public works are funded

136
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:45,738
So, this town lives off that Transparent

137
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:12,131
TRANSPARENT

138
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,250
Thank you for coming. Oh, allow me

139
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,110
Thanks

140
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:31,710
I'm Homma. Nice to meet you

141
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:38,091
The Committee told us to help you,

142
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:41,593
You have new identity as an observer

143
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,959
Amazing hospital

144
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,835
The Committee built it

145
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:47,761
I see

146
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:51,102
This is built for Satomi Kenichi

147
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,403
It's a Transparent Public Works project

148
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,381
The medical unit

149
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:05,980
Good morning

150
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,064
This is Dr. Azuma, our Chief of Surgery

151
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,763
He supervises Satomi Kenichi

152
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:19,868
Nice to meet you

153
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:24,941
Dr. Satomi around?

154
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:37,682
This is Komatsu Yoko

155
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,686
She's here as an observer

156
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,017
Nice to meet you

157
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,881
Nice to meet you

158
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:44,385
Observer?

159
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:47,127
Actually the Committee's new spy

160
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,899
(Damn! I'm late again)

161
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,366
He just passed me. He'll arrive in 10sec

162
00:15:56,607 --> 00:16:00,304
(Oh, shit! I'll never make it!)

163
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:02,677
At the door

164
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,813
Lobby area ready, Ready to escort

165
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:18,057
(Why do I turn off my alarm! Stupid)

166
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:23,324
(Jerk!)

167
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,534
(Jerk, you better watch those corners)

168
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,104
Don't bother!

169
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,464
He'll be here any minute now, sorry

170
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:34,242
(Shit, it's hopeless I'm totally late)

171
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:35,470
That was...

172
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,907
Seems he's arrived

173
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:38,941
What?

174
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:41,810
(Move! Move! Move, dammit!)

175
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,178
Unbelievable

176
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:48,782
(I'll get yelled at again)

177
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:53,420
I'm sorry, I'm late

178
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:56,356
(Here we go. What a drag...)

179
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:01,166
Satomi, this is the doctor I told you

180
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,035
Komatsu Yoko, here as an observer

181
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,804
Nice to meet you. I'm Satomi Kenichi

182
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:07,976
Nice to meet you, too

183
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:09,277
(Shoot)

184
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:13,674
(I thought she'd be younger. No chicken)

185
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:14,947
No chicken...

186
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:18,882
Oh, sorry, I just...

187
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:24,921
(What a mess)

188
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,163
(This morning, I have to order CAT scan)

189
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,564
(After that, it's rounds and conference)

190
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,302
(Make an intern do that crap)

191
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,635
His thoughts are crystal clear

192
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:45,511
I could never have imagined this

193
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,680
It's OK to broadcast that?

194
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:52,217
Apparently...

195
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:00,662
Case #7 has knowledge of Transparents

196
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:04,624
It would be natural to let him know

197
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:09,631
Because he doesn't know he's Transparent

198
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,200
And you are?

199
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:15,105
We're Special Police assigned to him

200
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,476
We always disguise as staff and patients

201
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:21,341
For the Unexpected

202
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:22,645
The Unexpected?

203
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:25,588
(Ouch!)

204
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:26,586
Are you OK?

205
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,190
(How dare you, you idiot!)

206
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,990
(God, how embarrassing...)

207
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:35,861
(How tacky. That hurts...)

208
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,660
Case #7 is a valuable national resource

209
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:43,697
Violating the Act is a criminal offense,

210
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:49,837
Someone might point out he's Transparent

211
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:53,612
So we have him under 24hour surveillance

212
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:55,880
So I see

213
00:18:57,187 --> 00:19:00,350
He may be a genius,

214
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:05,022
But he causes trouble in this hospital

215
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,656
Trouble?

216
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:14,301
We shall begin Dr. Takemura's rounds

217
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:16,332
Rounds

218
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,076
How are you?

219
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,403
Fine, thank you

220
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:22,944
Oh, good. His chart...

221
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,347
(Chart, chart... here)

222
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:31,550
This patient has swelling in the neck,

223
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:35,016
Protruding eyeball and weight loss

224
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,190
What is the correct diagnosis? You

225
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,295
Yes... Aggravation of Thyroid function

226
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:47,128
(But first, you should do a scintigram)

227
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:49,836
(and check hormone levels in his blood)

228
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,974
But... first I'd do a scintigram,

229
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,373
and check hormone levels in his blood

230
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:58,072
Good. And an effective treatment?

231
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:01,177
Isotopic Therapy. Radioiodine

232
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:05,846
Collects in the thyroid

233
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:09,049
(lsotopic Therapy can reap benefits)

234
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:13,720
(with no radiation side-effects)

235
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,530
(Any idiot knows that)

236
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:18,223
Although it offers short-term benefits

237
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:23,363
You risk thyroid deterioration

238
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,100
You're Mita, right...

239
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,276
I see you study hard

240
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,542
Who's next?

241
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,211
Hirayama san's waiting for you

242
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:41,948
Yasuba san, with your good test results,

243
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,754
Doesn't mean you should smoke

244
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:47,128
(Lung cancer'll kill you)

245
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,231
It's hard to give up...

246
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:55,728
Listen, this hospital serves good food

247
00:20:55,872 --> 00:20:59,706
Nice nurses. Maybe I'll move in for good

248
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,878
Well, don't overdo it

249
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:09,409
(Try to trick him with dirty old move)

250
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:26,100
(Damn I'm hungry What to eat...)

251
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,903
(Today's special is...)

252
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,200
Here he is

253
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:34,467
I'd like the special

254
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:36,170
One special coming up

255
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,642
here you are

256
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,123
Thanks for the food

257
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:00,770
(Lousy...)

258
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:57,221
Thank you, teacher

259
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:04,657
Kiyo san, you're so generous

260
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:09,431
You do not charge for lessons

261
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:13,036
But my Kenichi is a nuisance for others,

262
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:16,144
Giving lessons is the least I can do

263
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:21,242
No, We have life easy because of Kenichi

264
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:24,650
We can get gas lines and a sewage system

265
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,586
And big tax breaks to boot

266
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:31,792
No harm in hearing a few pesky voices

267
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:34,863
Compared to him, my son is a real leech

268
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:38,590
Might as well have been born Transparent

269
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:40,258
I mean, Transparents...

270
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:44,367
Excuse me, sorry to butt in

271
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,370
Why, Town Councilman

272
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:49,878
I'm sorry I have to be the one, Kiyo san

273
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:52,977
But your Kenichi's, what d'you call 'em?

274
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:53,878
Thought Waves!

275
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:55,379
That's right!

276
00:23:55,518 --> 00:24:00,649
Your neighbors hear them all night long,

277
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:05,621
I'm so sorry for all the trouble...

278
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,361
The Case #7's thoughts are special

279
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:18,162
Everyone around him at the hospital

280
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:23,141
suffers extreme stress by his thoughts

281
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:28,275
It's obvious that Transparents can only

282
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:32,677
co-exist with citizens if they cooperate

283
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,587
Case #7's qualifications on surgical...

284
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:43,493
(Not again...)

285
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:50,172
(Still no surgery for me What is this?)

286
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,601
Good morning

287
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:53,999
You've got a gall bladder next week

288
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,711
It's your fifth case since coming here

289
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:01,242
You're the star of Surgery

290
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,314
(Why don't I get a bladder)

291
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,384
Sorry

292
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,923
(I can handle a gall bladder)

293
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:20,502
No way, because you're Transparent

294
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:23,670
Excuse me

295
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,340
Dr. Azuma

296
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:31,138
I saw the surgery schedule

297
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:32,775
(I'm better)

298
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,717
And?

299
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:39,922
You scheduled Dr. Mita for operations

300
00:25:40,924 --> 00:25:42,357
Why can't I operate?

301
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:43,823
(Of course I'm better than he is)

302
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:46,684
Doctor

303
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,066
There's reason why you're not fit for it

304
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,638
(What's that?) What's that?

305
00:25:56,673 --> 00:25:59,471
You lack the experience to be a surgeon

306
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:00,700
Excuse me

307
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:12,214
Because his thoughts are so transparent?

308
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:15,858
Not fit to handle really sick patients?

309
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:20,619
Although there is Informed Consent,

310
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:24,891
Patient should not hear every detail

311
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:30,232
Say the patient is a politician

312
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:34,575
His medical condition might affect a lot

313
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,312
If Transparent doctor leaks it to others

314
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,541
doctor-patient confidentiality is ajoke

315
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,077
I understand

316
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:51,851
Kenichi isn't suitable for clinical work

317
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:06,999
(Extraction of a gall bladder is speed)

318
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:09,669
(The approach I'd...)

319
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,746
(Why won't they let me...)

320
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:14,747
Good morning

321
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,045
Good morning

322
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:18,779
(What does she want?)

323
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:25,422
How come you want to be a surgeon?

324
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:28,256
Why...

325
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:29,262
(Wow, that's Megumi)

326
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:34,394
(In a mini-skirt She looks so cute...)

327
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,202
Your reaction's abnormal

328
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:39,000
Sorry

329
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,611
(Girls like presents)

330
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:53,517
(A present... a pendant... Or a ring?)

331
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:57,390
(That's it!)

332
00:27:58,294 --> 00:28:01,821
(Act naturally)

333
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:05,096
Hey, there

334
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:06,766
Yes

335
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:10,099
Do you prefer pendants or rings?

336
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,998
What?

337
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:17,405
I wonder which you'd like for present

338
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:19,109
No!

339
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:20,141
(Why not?)

340
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,349
you know... as an aspiring physician,

341
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:31,652
Wear things might pose risk to patients

342
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:36,898
So I never, ever, wear rings

343
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,890
Of course

344
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:40,800
(Of course)

345
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:44,104
Oops, I have to run to an examination

346
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,032
Excuse me

347
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,237
(She realized the dangers of a ring)

348
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:55,845
(I never even thought about it)

349
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:02,691
Who's she?

350
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,854
Kawakami Megumi, an intern here

351
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,156
She's 3 years younger than him

352
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:18,169
Definitely he's a Transparent

353
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:20,906
Well, everybody knows that

354
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,001
That's just it Everybody'll know

355
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:26,479
What if I date him. Not just our talk,

356
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:32,415
but if we had sex and how many times,

357
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,589
and whether it felt good or...

358
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:36,885
Just, just calm down now

359
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:43,158
The next day, all will know my business

360
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,993
I can't stand that even if I love him

361
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,330
Well then, why not just turn him down?

362
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:53,833
If he says he loves me, I can refuse him

363
00:29:54,277 --> 00:30:02,013
How can I ask Do you love me?

364
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:04,313
You've got a point...

365
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:08,021
Please, give me a chance to reject him

366
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:10,917
Me?

367
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:15,795
Please

368
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,703
Right now, the biggest concern

369
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:31,503
Is that Case #7 seems to love Megumi

370
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:38,884
No Transparent has ever loved a human

371
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:42,919
Clearly, we must solve it quickly,

372
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,495
Consideration to Megumi's feelings

373
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,897
Under the Transparent Protection Act,

374
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,461
Transparent's thoughts subject others to

375
00:30:53,803 --> 00:31:00,231
stress violates another's privacy,

376
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:02,504
the situation must quickly be defused

377
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,245
So, we need an immediate solution

378
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,441
I say let the hospital fire him,

379
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:11,109
and send him to the research facility

380
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:15,114
The Ministry controls teaching hospitals

381
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:19,692
The Ministry should cancel his license

382
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:24,689
There you go passing the buck as usual

383
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,996
You're out of your mind!

384
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:28,661
I understand

385
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:33,205
Given our Committee's record,

386
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:36,940
It's no trouble to break Case #7's heart

387
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,074
Thank you so much

388
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:44,512
But we'll need... your cooperation

389
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:46,279
Cooperation?

390
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,454
A date?

391
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:52,958
Will you mind if we had a date tomorrow?

392
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:54,623
What a surprise

393
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,095
(Does she have the hots for me?)

394
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,702
No, I will be with Megumi tomorrow

395
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:04,771
and I thought, the more the merrier!

396
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:06,739
(Megumi!)

397
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:10,202
I'm available, definitely!

398
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,211
(Go for it! Excellent!)

399
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:16,317
(Where? A date, let's see Where to go...)

400
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:18,810
I, um, hadn't decided...

401
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:20,279
(Where)

402
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:31,460
Oh, I see

403
00:32:32,835 --> 00:32:38,705
You have a date? Where?

404
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:47,114
A festival in the next town?

405
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:51,344
There's fireworks, and it's tomorrow!

406
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:55,856
Get me the Cabinet Secretary for meeting

407
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,757
Interrupt him! This is a real emergency!

408
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:17,979
On the double! Clock's ticking!

409
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:28,090
The load-in is complete Next, the Team!

410
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:40,625
Why do we have to dress up this way...

411
00:33:41,237 --> 00:33:45,697
Well, it is a festival

412
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:48,606
Not exactly my style...

413
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:53,673
(Damn! I'm late! I'm totally late!)

414
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,779
(Why'd I turn off my alarm!)

415
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:58,580
Sorry, I'm late Oh, no...

416
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:03,387
You look great in that

417
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:05,621
Oh, not at all

418
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:08,926
(She looks so cute in that)

419
00:34:09,832 --> 00:34:11,561
What about me?

420
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,937
I'm sorry, there's no time

421
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:24,210
You are bribing us with cheap sake!

422
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,280
I'm sorry, it won't be long

423
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:29,012
You jerk! Everyone we need your...

424
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:50,299
(She can't drop a pendant even at work)

425
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:55,307
(She won't be scolded, it's perfect)

426
00:34:56,512 --> 00:35:00,073
(I hope Megumi'll wear it...)

427
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,349
But, is this OK?

428
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,915
What's OK?

429
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,020
It's so sudden and so far

430
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:16,597
It is a date. It's just one town away

431
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:19,195
I heard once,

432
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:24,439
that Satomi's never go out of Okumino

433
00:35:25,408 --> 00:35:26,238
What?

434
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:45,426
A Transparent will join you today,

435
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:50,923
be sure not to speak anything to him

436
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:59,600
And even if you do overhear his thoughts

437
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:07,009
If you break rules, you'll be arrested

438
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,874
so you must obey

439
00:36:33,642 --> 00:36:34,973
Roger, report to me

440
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:39,480
We're doing our best, but something else

441
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:40,307
What?

442
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,882
Director Kunimitsu hasn't arrived

443
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:44,615
Why not?

444
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:49,615
How'd they end up at a festival!

445
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:50,623
Hey, hurry!

446
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,656
They've made me assistant Scout master...

447
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,313
Hey! That's it! Hurry! Hurry!

448
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:21,214
Chase it! Get ahead of it!

449
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:24,288
Get there faster! Hurry! Faster!

450
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:31,965
(When shall I give her the pendant)

451
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:35,564
(That's when I just tell her how I feel)

452
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:39,499
(God, it makes me nervous)

453
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,878
Just passed Point F

454
00:37:59,795 --> 00:38:03,390
Go faster! We're out of time!

455
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,466
We need your cooperation

456
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,361
Faster!

457
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:39,817
(I've got a good feeling...

458
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,757
(I think today's the right day...)

459
00:39:58,113 --> 00:39:59,410
Just in time

460
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:12,726
Protection Manual #17. Stage 1 begin

461
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:16,961
There we are

462
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:17,861
Hello

463
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,930
Hello

464
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:20,967
(Who's this guy?)

465
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:26,966
Let me introduce This is Takahashi san,

466
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,409
and we've been...

467
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:33,345
I'm Takahashi, Megumi's boyfriend

468
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,339
(... for real?)

469
00:40:38,554 --> 00:40:39,316
OK

470
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:40,885
Stage 2

471
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:48,596
(What does he means, boyfriend...)

472
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:51,565
What kind of work do you do?

473
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:55,170
A friend and I started an IT firm

474
00:40:55,404 --> 00:40:57,395
and it's finally up and running

475
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,799
He's the President

476
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:02,407
Wow, a real entrepreneur

477
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:06,508
(Entrepreneur! He's just nouveau riche!)

478
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,913
I heard your father's a lawyer?

479
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:14,919
Yes, I come from a family of lawyers

480
00:41:15,324 --> 00:41:17,622
They still want him to become one, too

481
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:20,222
From a good family I'm envious

482
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,301
(Good family. Kind of spoiled rich kid)

483
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:30,530
(selfish, bratty and full of himself)

484
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:36,970
OK, now call Children 1 through 3

485
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,138
Children 1 through 3 standing by

486
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:45,379
5 seconds, 4, 3, 2, 1

487
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:47,386
Off you go!

488
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,189
No, I hate this color!

489
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:51,349
What? I said, just go!

490
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:56,595
Oh, it's Takahashi and his girlfriend

491
00:41:56,865 --> 00:41:59,800
Hey, guys, Way cool

492
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:01,797
You're popular with kids

493
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:04,799
I volunteer as an assistant Scout master

494
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:07,703
So I take them camping and hiking

495
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:11,575
(So he's popular with kids...)

496
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:12,611
Assistant Scout master!

497
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,280
Yes, shall we go?

498
00:42:16,552 --> 00:42:19,316
(So kids like him, big deal)

499
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:23,988
Not just kids Seniors A and B

500
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:25,919
Seniors A and B, standing by

501
00:42:26,395 --> 00:42:31,526
5 seconds, 4, 3, 2, 1

502
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:35,894
Oh, Takahashi san

503
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:37,130
Hello

504
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,763
Thank you for the other day

505
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:40,364
The pleasure was all mine

506
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:44,241
I'll give you croquet tips. Come again

507
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:49,409
Right, stop teasing me...

508
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:57,488
(Maybe he's a decent guy, after all)

509
00:42:58,026 --> 00:43:01,621
Site 5 passed. We follow the Manual

510
00:43:03,632 --> 00:43:05,065
This is Site 4

511
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:08,265
Is the drunk on the main path?

512
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:10,869
Drunk?

513
00:43:11,306 --> 00:43:15,800
Well, damn this Transparent

514
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:21,111
He ruined all the fun at the festival

515
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:26,753
Where's this Transparent of yours?

516
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,858
Emergency! Captain Komatsu, you're on!

517
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:48,765
Check the area! On the double!

518
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:50,168
I'm on...

519
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:52,537
Stumble!

520
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:56,874
Just stumble!

521
00:43:57,586 --> 00:43:58,484
Yes

522
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,727
Dr. Komatsu!

523
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:08,887
Dr. Komatsu!

524
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,200
Hey, Transpa...

525
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:24,240
Are you OK?

526
00:44:24,513 --> 00:44:25,673
Just in time

527
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,139
(ls she nuts?)

528
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:29,145
Let's go on up

529
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,279
(What's with her?)

530
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:45,496
That was a close call

531
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,870
Moving onto Site 7. Pick it up at shrine

532
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,872
You gave him the ring?

533
00:44:52,241 --> 00:44:53,401
I checked

534
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,248
Oh, sorry

535
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:36,411
(I wish I hadn't... come today)

536
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:42,420
(Me and my lousy luck)

537
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,756
(What am I doing here?)

538
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:56,495
There you are

539
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:58,596
Oh, good, I thought we lost you

540
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:03,109
Is everything OK? You seem a little down

541
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:05,707
Oh, no...

542
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:09,006
We're at a festival, let's have fun

543
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:13,349
(Right, if I'm down...)

544
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:16,189
(lt's no fun for them either)

545
00:46:16,892 --> 00:46:19,656
The drums and fireworks will start soon

546
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:22,355
Followed by the dancing You must stay

547
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:25,065
(I've got to say something...)

548
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:28,795
Everybody will dance I've never seen it

549
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:30,161
What fun

550
00:46:30,272 --> 00:46:33,673
(I've got to say something...)

551
00:46:41,116 --> 00:46:44,279
We don't have a good view, let's move up

552
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:45,149
Sure

553
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:49,382
#7's watching you, get closer

554
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,342
Nice and romantic, let's go

555
00:47:13,648 --> 00:47:19,848
5 seconds to fireworks,4, 3, 2, 1

556
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:44,067
(Oh... a ring...)

557
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:15,403
As a doctor, I never wear anything...

558
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:20,714
So I never, ever, wear rings

559
00:48:37,466 --> 00:48:39,093
I'm going home

560
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:40,723
But the dancing...

561
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:45,103
I've just remembered something, goodbye

562
00:49:21,743 --> 00:49:23,176
Great job

563
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:27,640
Thank you

564
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,148
Keep communication. Call off the alert

565
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:08,251
I just came to drop something off

566
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:12,651
Please

567
00:50:16,731 --> 00:50:18,892
You're with the Committee?

568
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:21,027
You can tell?

569
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:26,266
None of his friends or colleagues

570
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:30,068
have ever come to visit him before, so...

571
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,174
I see

572
00:50:33,481 --> 00:50:37,440
He's a grown man with a child's heart

573
00:50:38,153 --> 00:50:42,385
He's never really dated a woman.

574
00:50:42,657 --> 00:50:46,115
Actually, today he...

575
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:51,155
Sounds like he was jilted by Kawakami

576
00:50:53,168 --> 00:50:55,102
I heard him

577
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:05,039
I realized you suffer more than anyone

578
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:09,915
You're with him 24 hours a day

579
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:13,253
ut pretend you don't hear a thing

580
00:51:13,922 --> 00:51:17,517
We can't imagine how difficult it is

581
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:20,287
I'm not pretending

582
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:28,729
He's just an honest boy

583
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:37,808
Excuse me

584
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:40,715
Dr. Komatsu

585
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:44,619
Give me just a second?

586
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,116
I'm sorry to barge in

587
00:51:46,154 --> 00:51:48,054
No, sorry for the mess

588
00:51:48,223 --> 00:51:49,190
Oh, no

589
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:51,750
Please

590
00:51:53,261 --> 00:51:54,193
Say...

591
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,127
What is it?

592
00:51:56,231 --> 00:52:00,691
You left this behind

593
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:06,364
Oh... I'm sorry

594
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:07,797
For what?

595
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:12,004
For dragging you along

596
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,143
Were you bored?

597
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:17,184
Bored? Why no...

598
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:22,222
Actually

599
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:26,286
Actually I was in love with Megumi

600
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:31,430
Oh, I see... I had no idea

601
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:36,025
So I was thrilled when you invited me

602
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:41,265
My first real date I was all excited

603
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:47,077
I wanted to show her my feelings with it

604
00:52:49,117 --> 00:52:50,141
But...

605
00:52:50,552 --> 00:52:59,790
(I'm glad he seems like such a nice guy)

606
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:07,293
I mean, no use dwelling on it, right?

607
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:12,072
Besides, I think you're looking good

608
00:53:12,574 --> 00:53:14,474
They just don't know it yet

609
00:53:15,176 --> 00:53:21,274
Someday, you will find someone perfect

610
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:23,540
No, I... It's OK...

611
00:53:24,486 --> 00:53:25,680
(Nobody ever said that)

612
00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:29,482
(Dr. Komatsu's kind of...)

613
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:33,718
(Hey, I'm...)

614
00:53:34,929 --> 00:53:36,829
(all nervous)

615
00:53:39,367 --> 00:53:41,767
(I think she's kinda cute)

616
00:53:44,706 --> 00:53:48,767
(Maybe... Maybe I...)

617
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:54,678
(In love...)

618
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:59,382
Not again?

619
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:23,943
Give me a present which is for other?

620
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,654
(Why isn't she wearing it?)

621
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,596
(She accepted. It means she likes me)

622
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,028
(Hey, is she being shy?)

623
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:55,876
(She's so cute)

624
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:06,744
Hear those thought waves?

625
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:09,279
Say, did you hear the latest?

626
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:13,756
Transparent's got a girlfriend?

627
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:16,022
Can you believe it?

628
00:55:22,704 --> 00:55:26,936
I've heard, Yoko san You're so brave

629
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:39,275
Are you crazy! Why should Satomi Kenichi

630
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:41,546
and I go on vacation together!

631
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:43,387
Not so loud

632
00:55:43,725 --> 00:55:45,716
What is the Committee thinking?

633
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:49,287
We must consider our employees' welfare

634
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:55,235
The Special Police who are covering #7

635
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:58,300
are exhausted from years of duty

636
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:00,374
What does that have to do with me?

637
00:56:00,808 --> 00:56:03,777
It's even worse wherever Kenichi is

638
00:56:03,978 --> 00:56:06,037
And so we've devised

639
00:56:06,214 --> 00:56:11,584
solution to kill two-birds-with-a-stone

640
00:56:14,255 --> 00:56:16,280
Here... But why me?

641
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:19,286
Your profession is...

642
00:56:19,727 --> 00:56:20,887
Psychiatry...

643
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:23,387
Your specialty?

644
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,557
Research on Transmission Disorder

645
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:28,628
As a Transparent, Case #7 is also...

646
00:56:29,671 --> 00:56:32,367
...categorized as Transmission Disorder

647
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:34,704
It's extremely rare

648
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:36,368
Only 7 cases in the country

649
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:39,045
What researcher would throw away this

650
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:45,485
first hand, round-the-clock observation

651
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:47,818
No one

652
00:56:52,593 --> 00:56:53,924
In that case, here

653
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,197
But that's not the...

654
00:57:00,902 --> 00:57:04,633
I want you to know, this is an order

655
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:24,186
A deserted island I hadn't thought of it

656
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:29,425
Bringing him when he's wiped out from

657
00:57:29,664 --> 00:57:31,291
an extended shift is a nice touch

658
00:57:31,632 --> 00:57:33,224
Thank you

659
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:36,429
The island is 8kms around

660
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:42,308
There's an old ruin on the north side

661
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:46,945
No one will overhear his thoughts there

662
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,648
You can relax

663
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:51,881
If anything should happen...

664
00:57:57,492 --> 00:57:59,892
Anything should happen...

665
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,049
I'm done! I'm going in!

666
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,053
Wait!

667
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:47,665
(lt's so salty. So this is the ocean)

668
00:58:49,043 --> 00:58:50,704
(Wow! I'm glad to be alive!)

669
00:58:58,052 --> 00:59:00,577
C'mon, let's swim together

670
00:59:02,156 --> 00:59:04,989
Exposing myself at this age takes...

671
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:20,504
Satomi!

672
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:25,771
Gotcha!

673
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,308
No fair!

674
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:37,107
Thanks for the meal

675
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:41,877
(Lousy)

676
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,455
It's good and spicy

677
01:00:45,693 --> 01:00:46,955
Too spicy?
