1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,391
How beautiful

2
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:28,472
(Yoko and I are alone on this island)

3
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:34,278
(Does that make us Adam and Eve...)

4
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:38,188
I knew he'd get there

5
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:42,486
We're like Adam and Eve, aren't we?

6
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:49,366
Didn't think he'd actually say it

7
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:18,863
Actually I've never traveled

8
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:24,400
I traveled with my parents when small

9
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,901
but I don't remember

10
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,913
When I was 3, I was in a plane crash

11
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,676
That was the last time

12
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:40,349
Oh, I see

13
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:48,086
My parents died in that crash

14
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:51,124
I was the only survivor

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,861
(I wonder why I was the only one)

16
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:59,433
When I learned I was the only survivor

17
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,104
I began to wonder why...

18
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:07,871
Why it was me... and only me...

19
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:10,644
I don't believe in God especially

20
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:17,383
but there's a reason why I'm alive here

21
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:19,588
And I still think so

22
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:53,419
What?

23
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:39,728
(Please... be quiet)

24
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:50,639
A Transparent

25
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:21,064
I'm sorry I had to be rough

26
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:28,640
Come in, Please

27
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:44,331
But I had no choice

28
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:49,670
(He won't overhear my thoughts I'm safe)

29
00:05:55,911 --> 00:06:01,042
Excuse me. You are...

30
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,686
Shigefumi Japan's 1st Transparent

31
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,390
30 years ago,

32
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,134
when I was in fear of my abnormality

33
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:25,806
the government asked me to help create

34
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,203
the Committee and the Protection Act

35
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:33,981
I thought the 1st Transparent suicide

36
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:43,319
When I found that I was a Transparent

37
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:48,859
And I did consider suicide

38
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:54,460
(How to live with every thought exposed)

39
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:05,135
But the Committee knew those thoughts

40
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:11,483
Ironically, because I was a Transparent,

41
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,886
I couldn't even kill myself

42
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,557
And by the time they let me out,

43
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,222
I'd lost the will to do it

44
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:30,060
So you've been all alone on this island

45
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:36,139
Life's gotten awfully convenient

46
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:39,511
I can do things without personal contact

47
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,551
and get most things I need

48
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,678
(I've never given one to someone)

49
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,717
I never intended to meet anyone

50
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:34,192
Do you know Medusa from Greek?

51
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:42,033
Everyone sees her turns to stone

52
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:47,813
Transparents are a kind of Medusa

53
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,684
Whatever they think about another,

54
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,285
good or bad, it's all exposed

55
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,155
Their thoughts freeze everyone near them

56
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:06,299
No one wants to turn into stone

57
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,793
So someone like me,

58
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,541
has no choice but to live this way

59
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:20,841
(Thank God I was right)

60
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,283
(Talk to someone... who's with me)

61
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,185
I'm so glad I met you

62
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,381
and talked to you like this

63
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,654
(lt's so lonely being all alone)

64
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,695
I'd better be getting back

65
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:19,465
Wait, a little...

66
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,577
Yoko san

67
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:49,062
Go, now!

68
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,237
Shiraki san!

69
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,296
Forget it, just get out of here!

70
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,865
Don't come any closer

71
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:57,767
What's wrong!

72
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:01,479
I just touched your skin

73
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:05,942
The touch and warmth of human skin

74
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:10,752
It's been so many years since I felt it

75
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:20,990
I've tried not to think about it

76
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:24,666
Now that I have, I can't stop myself

77
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,330
(Your... your body...)

78
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:30,908
(I want your naked...)

79
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:32,945
Shiraki San

80
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:37,707
You can hear me,

81
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:44,018
how I imagine taking you inside my head,

82
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:45,886
(Breasts... lips... naked)

83
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,621
Even darker emotions...

84
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,162
I can't bear for you to know

85
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:55,232
Don't listen to my thoughts, get out

86
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,702
Please calm down, I'm a psychiatrist

87
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:02,934
I understand how you suffer

88
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,911
Just get out! Go!

89
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:08,510
Stop! Enough!

90
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:16,451
Yoko san!

91
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,789
You need help

92
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:26,899
Stay away!

93
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:35,976
You know nothing!

94
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:40,474
Your words won't help me

95
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:44,150
You can't imagine how terrible it is

96
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:48,014
Nobody can help me

97
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:58,156
Now you know The Transparent...

98
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,132
is the Medusa

99
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:16,406
I'm sorry. Please get out of here

100
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:22,790
Not for your sake, but for mine

101
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:34,563
...but I'm sure there's a reason

102
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,162
why I'm alive now, I still believe that

103
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:56,517
Yoko san

104
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:20,680
Where were you? I was so worried

105
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:26,915
(I'm so happy she's here)

106
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:31,616
(Oh, thank God she's back)

107
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:33,523
What were you doing?

108
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:37,825
(I woke up and she was gone)

109
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:43,262
(I was so worried and lonely)

110
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:45,736
(So all alone)

111
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:54,206
(So lonely, lonely...)

112
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,280
(Don't go anywhere again)

113
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:10,622
Yoko san?

114
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,765
(Why's she crying?)

115
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,639
(What happened?)

116
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:29,073
(Don't cry, please)

117
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:31,678
(Don't cry...)

118
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:39,588
Let's leave

119
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:41,191
What?

120
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:58,138
On that island, I learned

121
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:01,278
that I know absolutely nothing

122
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:05,276
of the overwhelming loneliness

123
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:10,386
Nor did I understand

124
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:22,766
why I had held Satomi Kenichi

125
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:33,604
in my arms or how I should behave

126
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:56,765
Excuse me...

127
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:00,402
(Did I do something wrong?)

128
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:03,434
(I don't get it)

129
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:07,213
(What happened?)

130
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,840
(Why did she cry?)

131
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,420
(What happened? I don't get it)

132
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,717
Kenichi

133
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:23,761
(I don't get it)

134
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:27,098
Kenichi!

135
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:29,533
What?

136
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:33,637
What are you dreaming about? Not in love

137
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:37,710
Give me a break and leave me alone!

138
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:40,443
Eat it while it's hot

139
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:43,306
What is this!

140
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:44,145
I'm sorry

141
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:47,948
Are you all right? What are you doing?

142
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:49,453
Dammit, it's hot!

143
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:51,251
Whatever am I doing?

144
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,393
Messing up my room

145
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,023
I'll do it

146
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,027
No, I'll do it

147
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,328
I will!

148
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:04,796
Let me do it You'll ruin the tatami mat

149
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:08,902
Oh, dear me, I made quite a mess

150
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:17,241
(Was grandma always this tiny?)

151
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,926
Let me do it, grandma

152
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,323
You're getting old, grandma

153
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:33,091
Just a little tired, that's all

154
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:36,765
You should have an exam at our hospital

155
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:39,002
I'll arrange it at the Health Center

156
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:42,704
There's nothing wrong with me

157
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,334
Just in case

158
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:02,521
Pancreatic cancer

159
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:06,932
The permeation is apparent

160
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,827
There's no doubt

161
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:12,895
Given its size, it's quite advanced

162
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:14,808
Any family?

163
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,870
Case #7 is her only family

164
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:20,045
Dr. Satomi...

165
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:23,708
We can't tell him He's a Transparent

166
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,517
We've told that she got hyperlipidemia

167
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,883
and we're admitting her for tests

168
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,419
I understand

169
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:37,360
We've to get Dr. Satomi out of hospital,

170
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:40,365
His grandma may find out what's wrong

171
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:44,268
The Committee has to make a move

172
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,168
that Transparent into research

173
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:49,500
What a blessing for us

174
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:51,176
That's right, yes

175
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,708
Thank you for being good to my grandson

176
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,647
Why, of course

177
00:19:57,852 --> 00:20:01,413
Please continue your kindness

178
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,484
Grandma, what are you doing!

179
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,817
Thanking your colleagues

180
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:09,486
You don't need to

181
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,224
But I thought I would

182
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,892
OKay, that's enough Go to your room

183
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:17,064
(She's so embarrassing)

184
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:50,834
About the island...

185
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:56,904
I'm sorry

186
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:00,870
You don't have to apologize

187
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,046
(What happened...)

188
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,152
It's so inconvenient with grandma gone

189
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:14,983
Yes

190
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:19,389
can't hospitalize her for cholesterol

191
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:23,566
(I'm so relieved it's nothing serious)

192
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,502
You've always lived with her

193
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:39,049
That's why you're so close I'm jealous

194
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,353
Remember you asked me why to be surgeon?

195
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,167
It's before I went to elementary school

196
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:58,262
One night I got a terrible fever

197
00:21:58,672 --> 00:21:59,604
It hurts, grandma, it hurts

198
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:04,733
You'll be OK, Kenichi

199
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,672
Kenichi, you'll be OK

200
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,110
Grandma'll take care of you

201
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:23,327
When grandma saved me that night,

202
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:25,531
I was just so happy what She did but...

203
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,396
I was so deeply grateful to her

204
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:36,235
But I didn't know how to tell her

205
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,678
That's why

206
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:44,910
That's why I decided to be a doctor

207
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,944
to help other people as well

208
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,756
That's the reason why I'm alive here

209
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:14,014
The Drug Research Lab has requested

210
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:19,848
you to join their staff the earliest

211
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:23,487
They want you to leave here

212
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:26,685
for new Lab job by the end of the month

213
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:31,491
But I've got to consider grandma

214
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:35,297
Then let me be frank

215
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:44,402
Our hospital has financial problems

216
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:52,843
The Board has ordered us to cut doctors

217
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:55,547
Surgery has to comply as well

218
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:58,888
You're eliminating me?

219
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:04,457
I would definitely cut you from surgery

220
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:08,468
(That's what you think of me)

221
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:12,431
Developing new drugs is important,

222
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:18,274
you'll help many more people

223
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:25,112
Can I think it over?

224
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,194
I'll report to the Committee

225
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:51,335
Recently,

226
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:56,742
I wonder what if I were a Transparent

227
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:03,789
That way, I'd never have to lie,

228
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:07,888
never have to hurt anyone

229
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:14,893
It's not just others who you hurt

230
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:20,462
Lying to others is not most difficult

231
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:28,544
They're the ones we tell ourselves

232
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:46,365
Grandma, the thing is,

233
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:50,833
I've been invited to the Research Lab

234
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:52,467
Really?

235
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:56,406
Researching new drugs is important work

236
00:25:57,678 --> 00:26:02,138
If I succeed, I can help lots of people

237
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:09,051
I'm more suited to that work

238
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,582
Why that's wonderful

239
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,362
You should work hard

240
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:27,964
If you want to go,

241
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:31,205
you should do what you want

242
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:38,376
Oh, dear, I'm quite tired today

243
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:40,811
I'll lie down

244
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:45,191
Have a good rest

245
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:52,588
(Grandma, I'm sorry)

246
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,702
(I couldn't become a doctor)

247
00:27:13,587 --> 00:27:17,353
Thank God, he will go to research lab

248
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:21,019
We'll be free of all his thoughts

249
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:25,298
Finally, it's back to business as usual

250
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:29,557
Don't tell about his grandma's cancer?

251
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:36,334
This shouldn't be told to a Transparent

252
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,081
He's leaving for the Research Lab today

253
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:56,255
Soon, they'll operate on Satomi Kiyo

254
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,657
This is the Committee's best plan

255
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:07,032
You've completed your mission as well

256
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:08,864
It's over, over

257
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,203
Finally, it's all settled

258
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:14,175
We should've sent him to the Lab earlier

259
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:15,508
Exactly

260
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:35,996
Please wait!

261
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:41,298
Given Case #7's psychological state,

262
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:44,872
you should postpone his transfer to Lab

263
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:46,674
What are you saying?

264
00:28:47,347 --> 00:28:50,510
The transfer's cleared the Ministry

265
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:53,042
It's too late to change now

266
00:28:53,186 --> 00:28:55,177
Taking him away from Kiyo

267
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:58,489
isn't necessarily the best idea

268
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,819
Let him stay until the operation finish

269
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:07,994
Don't consider the Transparent's wishes?

270
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:14,563
If he insists on staying as a doctor

271
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:19,704
We shouldn't ruin his dream of surgeon

272
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:23,407
A Transparent's still a Transparent

273
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,880
Transparents are humans, too

274
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:42,132
Even when they make the wrong choices,

275
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:46,662
they have the right to explore

276
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:55,014
Let him stay longer

277
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:58,948
Please

278
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:02,286
Unfortunately, that's impossible

279
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:05,315
Why is that?

280
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,620
As long as Case #7 is a Transparent,

281
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:12,228
we need to protect him

282
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,200
It's our duty

283
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:20,864
and it's the interests of his happiness

284
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:27,741
Trapping him in a cage is happiness?

285
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:17,994
OK, thank you

286
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:23,897
Dr. Azuma

287
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:25,396
Yes?

288
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,141
I'm very sick, aren't I?

289
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,803
We'll heal you over time

290
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,789
Can't you let my boy operate on me?

291
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:47,515
That's...

292
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:50,490
Maybe it's just family prejudice,

293
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:55,561
but he's worked so hard all these years

294
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,765
night after night,

295
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:02,465
chained to his desk...

296
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:07,472
All he wants is to become a doctor

297
00:32:07,814 --> 00:32:10,214
who can help people

298
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:11,948
But...

299
00:32:12,552 --> 00:32:14,042
I can't bear the thought of his

300
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:20,083
Hard work and devotion going to waste

301
00:32:25,198 --> 00:32:28,861
But it's impossible

302
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:35,406
I'm sorry

303
00:32:36,243 --> 00:32:39,303
I guess I shouldn't have brought it up

304
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,934
Thanks for everything

305
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:08,139
Work hard over there

306
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,654
Where's Dr. Satomi?

307
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:27,156
He just left for the Lab

308
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:42,832
Wait!

309
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:35,023
Kenichi

310
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:38,223
Stop, you have to follow our orders!

311
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:42,459
Don't worry, grandma'll look after you

312
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:44,559
You'll be fine

313
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:54,445
What happened?

314
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:20,634
Are you sure this is what you want?

315
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:22,638
I want? What?

316
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:26,303
Are you happy leaving this for the Lab?

317
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:31,006
Yeah, I'll be better at research anyway

318
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:33,409
(I can't be a surgeon)

319
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,155
Your grandma inspired you by saving you

320
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:39,384
Isn't it your turn to save her?

321
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:43,192
That's impossible I will join the Lab

322
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:45,626
(Why are you saying this?)

323
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,760
You're lying, Satomi

324
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:51,669
It's not like you to lie

325
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:53,136
I'm not lying

326
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:57,573
(Don't confuse me anymore Stop it)

327
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:03,480
Your grandmother has pancreatic cancer

328
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:04,479
What?

329
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:07,314
(Impossible... The test results...)

330
00:36:09,055 --> 00:36:13,219
People at the hospital hide it from you

331
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:14,517
But why...

332
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:17,459
(Because I'm a failure as a doctor)

333
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:19,292
No, that's not...

334
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:24,198
This is not your fault

335
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:30,670
You should know what you have to do

336
00:36:31,678 --> 00:36:36,012
Why are you alive here and now?

337
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:42,311
(The reason I'm alive here

338
00:36:56,302 --> 00:37:00,864
Case #7 is heading back surveillance

339
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:17,447
Dr. Azuma

340
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:23,552
What, leave something behind?

341
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:27,324
Please let me treat my grandmother

342
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:30,764
What's this? You're no longer part...

343
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:39,368
So you know about her illness

344
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:40,909
Yes

345
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:44,711
(Pancreatic cancer... And terminal)

346
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:49,278
And you still want to treat her?

347
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:51,385
Yes

348
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:07,564
(I'll save her life... i will)

349
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:13,009
(Grandma... I swear I will)

350
00:38:14,614 --> 00:38:17,811
(I swear)

351
00:38:21,888 --> 00:38:30,455
(I become a doctor because of you)

352
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:33,625
Please let me operate

353
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:43,970
Do you know why I never let you operate

354
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:45,976
No

355
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:51,445
Because you're far better than I am

356
00:38:57,924 --> 00:39:00,518
I was jealous

357
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:05,429
I didn't want to admit it,

358
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,830
so I lied to myself

359
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:16,507
You'll still have to leave the hospital

360
00:39:17,844 --> 00:39:21,746
It'll be your first and last operation

361
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,209
I'll make up your lack of experience

362
00:39:27,387 --> 00:39:29,878
It'll be tough, but go ahead

363
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:34,450
Yes, thank you

364
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:39,663
Dr. Mita

365
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,436
We've assigned a new surgeon

366
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,997
Yes Hurry, Dr. Mita

367
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:48,937
I understand

368
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:50,303
Wrong chart, Dr.

369
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,972
Is this Anesthesiology?

370
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:56,376
The surgery's assigned to other doctor

371
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,019
That's right, it's Dr. Satomi

372
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:09,291
It's just a little lump in your stomach

373
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:13,423
It's a simple procedure to remove it

374
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,899
(It's cancer...)

375
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,333
When it's gone, you'll live many years

376
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:22,900
I guarantee that

377
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:27,407
(Pancreatic cancer)

378
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:35,577
What's wrong, grandma?

379
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:41,326
You're so grown up

380
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:47,355
You were just a little boy

381
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,367
Thank you, doctor

382
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:09,854
(Sure)

383
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:14,793
(I swear I'll save your life)

384
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:26,272
Hurry

385
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:32,210
Back-up Team's here

386
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:38,641
We're scheduled for 13:00

387
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:42,488
No idea how forceful is his thoughts

388
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:49,159
We'll make security around 100m radius

389
00:41:49,762 --> 00:41:50,592
Got that?

390
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:51,695
Yes!

391
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:45,250
(Once I open, I check primary lesion,)

392
00:42:45,585 --> 00:42:50,522
(check hepatic metastasis)

393
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,781
(Mobilize the duodenum)

394
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:56,985
(Separate pancreas from peritoneum)

395
00:42:57,263 --> 00:43:00,630
(After cutting away the stomach,)

396
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:06,828
(Separate the pancreas at the SMV

397
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:11,905
(Tape the hepatic artery, portal vein)

398
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:14,237
(and excise the stomach)

399
00:43:38,638 --> 00:43:39,502
Sir

400
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:42,631
Why is Case #7 in the operating room!

401
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:49,537
Please, just be quiet and observe

402
00:44:03,963 --> 00:44:07,956
I'm ready to begin Anesthesiology

403
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:08,893
Please

404
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:10,591
Scalpel

405
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:16,968
(You can make it, grandma)

406
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,542
Here we go, everyone

407
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:52,711
No obvious hepatic eventration

408
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:54,309
Right

409
00:44:56,349 --> 00:45:00,285
The primary carcinoma's severe

410
00:45:02,255 --> 00:45:03,051
Yes

411
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:08,785
(Grandma, I'll get it all out of you)

412
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:14,123
(Steady now)

413
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:18,670
(I shouldn't damage the portal vein)

414
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,286
(I've removed the pancreas)

415
00:45:41,527 --> 00:45:44,724
(but the connective tissue inflamed,)

416
00:45:44,864 --> 00:45:48,925
(and it's hemorrhaging Stay calm, now)

417
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:52,437
(Carefully suture one area at a time)

418
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:09,078
(Damn, there's permeation of nerves)

419
00:46:09,822 --> 00:46:12,086
(I have to cut the advential tissue)

420
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:17,060
(Hang in, grandma It won't be long)

421
00:46:17,663 --> 00:46:19,028
Stable now

422
00:46:58,137 --> 00:47:02,335
(I just have to remove the jejunum)

423
00:47:06,812 --> 00:47:07,938
Specimen

424
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:11,811
Specimen, please confirm

425
00:47:11,951 --> 00:47:13,680
(Hang in there, grandma)

426
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,359
The carcinoma's out Now,

427
00:47:26,132 --> 00:47:27,190
Amazing

428
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:28,793
What's going on?

429
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:33,828
His first surgery is so precise

430
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:37,407
Dr. Azuma

431
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,034
Can you take a look?

432
00:47:39,712 --> 00:47:40,406
What?

433
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:43,210
Here Metastasization to the peritoneum

434
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:47,376
What happened?

435
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:51,251
What's wrong?

436
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:56,358
(It's too late...)

437
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,993
(we cut now, it'll recur)

438
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,269
It's really too bad

439
00:48:08,574 --> 00:48:09,598
Yes

440
00:48:11,343 --> 00:48:13,811
I'll repair and suture

441
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:20,414
30 Proline

442
00:48:31,197 --> 00:48:36,032
(Grandma, I'm sewing you up)

443
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:41,364
(I'm sorry, grandma)

444
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:49,304
(I was so near you, but I never...)

445
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:54,480
(I never noticed you were sick)

446
00:48:57,289 --> 00:48:58,586
(Grandma)

447
00:49:00,426 --> 00:49:04,829
(I'm so sorry I cut you open)

448
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:11,801
(Cut you so badly)

449
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:22,778
(I'm so sorry, grandma)

450
00:49:25,217 --> 00:49:26,411
(Grandma)

451
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:31,221
(I never even noticed)

452
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:33,253
Operation complete

453
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,618
Resume routine protective surveillance

454
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:44,894
(We lived together all that time)

455
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:58,041
(Why didn't I notice before it's late)

456
00:49:59,485 --> 00:50:01,578
(I'm so sorry, grandma)

457
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:08,792
(It's too late. Too late)

458
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:16,161
(Forgive me, grandma Forgive me)

459
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,038
There are alternative treatments

460
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:04,747
It's your duty as physician to see her

461
00:51:05,517 --> 00:51:06,882
What should I do?

462
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:13,855
Tell her what you have to

463
00:51:14,627 --> 00:51:15,753
Yes

464
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:08,602
It's done, grandma

465
00:52:09,748 --> 00:52:12,546
We got that lump out of you,

466
00:52:13,852 --> 00:52:15,444
so you'll be fine

467
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:18,614
I see

468
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:24,355
I'm glad

469
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:30,567
You were great

470
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:43,281
Thank you, Kenichi

471
00:52:48,654 --> 00:52:52,021
I have to go now

472
00:53:13,245 --> 00:53:16,703
You're all grown up

473
00:54:44,837 --> 00:54:48,000
(I couldn't save you... Grandma)

474
00:54:50,509 --> 00:54:53,842
(Don't thank me...)

475
00:54:58,283 --> 00:54:59,477
(Grandma...)

476
00:55:01,587 --> 00:55:05,318
(Grandma...)

477
00:55:08,026 --> 00:55:11,427
(Don't thank me)

478
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:18,235
(I was right there)

479
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:21,872
(But I couldn't help you)

480
00:55:24,843 --> 00:55:27,141
(Forgive me, grandma)

481
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:34,046
(I couldn't do...)

482
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:40,057
(A thing for you)

483
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:45,795
(Forgive me, grandma)

484
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:58,939
(Why didn't I notice before it's late)

485
00:56:01,313 --> 00:56:05,511
(Forgive me, grandma)

486
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:16,221
(I'm so sorry, grandma)

487
00:56:18,163 --> 00:56:20,597
(Forgive me)

488
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:31,674
(Grandma...)

489
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:06,835
Dr. Azuma

490
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:21,652
How did my grandson do?

491
00:57:23,428 --> 00:57:28,024
I've never met a more skillful surgeon

492
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:31,528
Oh, good

493
00:57:33,538 --> 00:57:37,907
Now I have no regrets...

494
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:42,175
Don't say that, Satomi san

495
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:46,516
There are many other treatments

496
00:57:47,886 --> 00:57:50,787
I'm in your hands

497
00:58:00,098 --> 00:58:03,033
We'll lick this thing together

498
00:58:04,436 --> 00:58:09,430
Thank you for everything

499
00:58:54,186 --> 00:58:55,847
For the next 6 months,

500
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:59,213
Kenichi acts as his grandma's physician

501
00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:03,318
He oversaw many treatments

502
00:59:03,495 --> 00:59:06,157
He was always by her side

503
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:11,594
You could say that Kenichi failed

504
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:15,398
to save his grandmother's life

505
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:18,705
But his surgery had consequences

506
00:59:19,544 --> 00:59:24,311
none of us could have dreamed of

507
00:59:25,617 --> 00:59:28,381
Unfortunately, you have a tumor

508
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,478
It's malignant, but at an early stage

509
00:59:32,824 --> 00:59:34,917
We consider it operable

510
00:59:37,562 --> 00:59:38,551
Excuse me... Um...

511
00:59:38,864 --> 00:59:40,126
Yes, what is it?

512
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:45,225
Can I request Dr. Satomi to operate?

513
00:59:47,939 --> 00:59:52,603
He's a Transparent. Do you get it?

514
00:59:52,944 --> 00:59:54,036
Yes... But,

515
00:59:54,913 --> 00:59:59,714
I want Kenichi to operate on me

516
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,284
Well, he's... certainly a fine surgeon

517
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:09,921
You have to fill out consent forms

518
01:00:25,977 --> 01:00:28,377
That's the 26th request this month

519
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,676
I won't send him to the Lab for awhile

520
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:36,346
And the Ministry of Health?

521
01:00:36,788 --> 01:00:39,689
I'll explain and offer an apology

522
01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:43,326
The Cabinet Secretary's furious with me

523
01:00:44,696 --> 01:00:48,132
That man keeps increasing my workload

524
01:00:50,936 --> 01:00:51,960
What?

525
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:57,941
The 1st time you refer Case #7 as a man

526
01:00:59,845 --> 01:01:03,008
Did I... say that?

527
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:26,001
There's more to the myth about Medusa

528
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:31,175
When the hero Perseus slays Medusa,

529
01:01:31,776 --> 01:01:36,679
Pegasus is born of her blood

530
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:42,916
Good morning

531
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:52,318
Thank you

532
01:01:52,464 --> 01:01:53,692
How wonderful

533
01:01:59,204 --> 01:02:01,001
Your patient, Dr. Mita

534
01:02:01,206 --> 01:02:02,002
Right

535
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,768
In the modern age, as words proliferate

536
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,315
it is difficult to know people's hearts

537
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:14,751
And many people suffer because of this

538
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:24,294
Maybe the modern age needs Transparents

539
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:26,319
Is Dr. Satomi in?

540
01:02:26,464 --> 01:02:28,022
May I help you?

541
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,965
Not you, again!

542
01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:35,902
I just want him to examine me

543
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:56,054
If we all accept Transparents as normal

544
01:02:57,395 --> 01:03:00,887
perhaps we'll have ushered in a new age

545
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:17,814
As Pegasus born from Medusa's blood,

546
01:03:18,683 --> 01:03:23,746
spread his wings across endless skies

547
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,327
So I have come to believe

548
01:04:27,419 --> 01:04:29,182
We're almost there, grandma

549
01:04:29,854 --> 01:04:31,651
Don't worry

550
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,426
Don't worry

551
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:42,300
Everybody knows you're a wonderful boy

552
01:04:43,435 --> 01:04:44,959
What are you talking about?

553
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:47,834
(What are you talking about?)

554
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:54,873
Look, grandma It's so beautiful

555
01:05:10,662 --> 01:05:14,257
Grandma Grandma
