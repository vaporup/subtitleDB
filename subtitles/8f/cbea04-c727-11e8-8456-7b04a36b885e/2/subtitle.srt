1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Want a room? Yes

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,270
A deluxe room for two

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,670
Please give us two seperate rooms

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,550
Two rooms, yes of course

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,910
Enjoy

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,110
The moment when we strike

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,430
you leave first, alright

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,510
We have someone seated at this table already

9
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,630
Would you mind...

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
I want to sit here for the fireworks

11
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,040
This Inn is for everybody

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,270
That is alright

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,990
I would like a new friend

14
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,150
I don't need friends

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,400
I have this whole Inn for tonight

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,950
But...

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,590
I've been following that tribe of merchants for a long time

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,190
Don't you dare touch them

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,310
Since I have the chance to meet Qinglong today

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,230
I, the Judge of the Desert, must see how great he is

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,110
Before it goes down, I will beat you

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,200
Go

23
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,310
Are you alright

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,550
Yes

25
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,590
No problem

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,310
Before this bowl stops spinning

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,150
I will beat you...

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,030
as well

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,030
Don't move

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,510
Qinglong

31
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,270
Draw your sword

32
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,310
I have no wish to fight you

33
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,390
But I will tell you this

34
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,040
They have a thousand taels of gold

35
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,590
They may win in numbers

36
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,070
But we can work together

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,510
Here is the map to the post

38
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,070
Let an arrow be our signal

39
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,270
to attack

40
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,590
How will we split it

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,910
I don't want any of it

42
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,110
I want something else from them

43
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,670
Why should I trust you

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,150
If the plan fails

45
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,470
I'll end my own life

46
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,470
We Sky Eagles have our own rules

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,790
The day

48
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,870
we rob something that is worth giving up our lives for

49
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,950
That is the day we turn in to righteous bandits

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,070
Qinglong

51
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,110
What are you after?

52
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,590
My dignity

53
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,550
Let's go  Go

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,750
Yes Sir

55
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,670


56
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,110


57
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,160


58
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,670


59
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,040


60
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,340


61
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,870


62
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,910


63
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,510
He said if I were ever to come, I should stay here with him

64
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,910
He said he would make up for everything he has ever done

65
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,870
I'm really here now

66
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,950
But with a Jinyiwei instead

67
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,790
Here is the money that I owe you

68
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,590
Go look for your fiance tomorrow

69
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,910
You want me to go back to him

70
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,110
Am I of no use to you now

71
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,350
you are of no use to me now

72
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
I took advantage and now finished

73
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,380
Why are you here alone?

74
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,680
I do not have family

75
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,470
Who am I here with if it weren't with myself

76
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,630
I am fortunate to have your company tonight

77
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,270
Many are after me

78
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,310
but their luck runs out

79
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,950
and I am always the only one left

80
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,790
That is depressing

81
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,670
The ones after you don't have it easy either

82
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,550
The more you understand the one you are looking for

83
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,310
The more you will treat him as a friend

84
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,790
Watching your friend goes down

85
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,520
How is that for depressing

86
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,350
The worst occassion

87
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,510
was when I killed my own brother

88
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,950
Do not worry

89
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,870
Your nightmare will soon end

90
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,310
I am mentally prepared each day

91
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,870
That before I go down

92
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,990
I must complete what I have set out to do

93
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,270
Whom ever stands in my way

94
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,390
No matter friend or foe

95
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,190
Will have to go down first

96
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,150
Fireworks have started

97
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,590
Take this inside

98
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,950
Where did you come from

99
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,230
Do not play here

100
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,790
Outside Outside

101
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,790
Big sister, our money

102
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,030
Thank you, big sister

103
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,870
Captain it must have been a long trip for you

104
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,790
Assisting Prince Qing to acquire three districts

105
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,910
Took me a lot of effort

106
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,710
My deepest gratitude, Sir Jia

107
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,510
I thank you on behalf of Prince Qing

108
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,710
Has Sir Jia brought

109
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,710
what we wanted

110
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,910
Is the Scroll here

111
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,550
I must take a routine look at it

112
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,110
Sir Jia, before I left

113
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,150
Prince Qing made some amends to the Scroll

114
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,510
It is Mid-Autumn Festival

115
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,990
Our first Emperor made his move on this day

116
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,110
and founded the Ming Dynasty

117
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,110
Prince Qing wants

118
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,590
the Imperial Seal of Approval on this Scroll

119
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,180
So that he can come forth into the city

120
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,510
What rubbish

121
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,980
This is a blatant revolt

122
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,510
You dare not to be understanding

123
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,670
Do you not fear for your head?

124
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,260
Xuan Wu, take the Seal

125
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,980
Xuan Wu, you...

126
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,310
Sir Jia

127
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,510
Did you not once say

128
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,110
When people see the glory of your success

129
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,070
They will forget the sinister nature of your means

130
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,110
I work for Prince Qing now

131
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,760
Sir Jia, thank you for teaching me that

132
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,870
Ready

133
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,630
Shoot

134
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,790
Tell our men to be on guard and secure this place

135
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,750
Kill anyone who comes in

136
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,350
Yes

137
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,270
Captain, Please hand me the Scroll

138
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,350
We should stamp it with the Seal

139
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,270
Kill

140
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,630
Kill

141
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,790
Here comes the Sky Eagles

142
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,110
Qinglong

143
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,150
Captain

144
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,790
This is family business for the Jinyiwei

145
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,230
Whomever stands in my way today

146
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,670
Will go down

147
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,670
I am stronger than any one of you

148
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,430
Am I wrong to pursue what I want

149
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,680
I know

150
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,790
You have always treated me like a brother

151
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,910
But did you not

152
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,710
kill your own brother too

153
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,120
Yes, and that has left me

154
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,030
a life more painful than death

155
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,590
The suffering

156
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,870
is a nightmare

157
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,630
that will never end

158
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,880
You will not want a life like mine

159
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,160


160
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,190
Kill him

161
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,550
I hate bullies

162
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,670
Judge of the Desert

163
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,950
I thought you only knew how to rob

164
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,030
I love to rob

165
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,270
but I love to fight more

166
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,240
Take this

167
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,390
Your carriage is behind the guard post

168
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,030
There is food and water

169
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,110
Enough for five days

170
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,350
Here is your gold

171
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,820
It is all mine?

172
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,550
It is all yours

173
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,030
The concept of robbing for anything other than riches

174
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,310
I really do not understand

175
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,710
If you've ever up for something like this again

176
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,830
Remember me

177
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,630
I will

178
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,420
Leave

179
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,070
Qinglong

180
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,630
Leave quickly

181
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,670
Go without me, leave quickly

182
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,110
Quickly

183
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,870
Quinglong, we count to three

184
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,350


185
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,270
One

186
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,550
Two

187
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,830
He will not

188
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,910
give up the Seal for me

189
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,670
Three

190
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,350
I'm sorry

191
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,310
Because of me, you lost the Seal

192
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,110
Did you not once say that everyone has a choice

193
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,040
How did she manage to capture you

194
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,270
After I went to find my fiance

195
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,510
I went back to find you

196
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,270
That is how she got me

197
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,470
Sorry

198
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,830
I shouldn't have asked you to find him

199
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,080
I should've personally delivered you to him

200
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,350
This is where...

201
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,830
we saw Qinglong fight with the girl from the West

202
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,110
Qinglong lost and he fled in our carriage

203
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,110
Brothers from the desert in the North also saw

204
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,230
war drums hoisted by Prince Qing's palace

205
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,310
A troop of ten thousand were standing by

206
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,030
ready to attack

207
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,710
At the same time, there were about three hundred fire shooters

208
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,510
aiming towards the City of Sky Wolves

209
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,510
Their intention unknown

210
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,480
The entire city is trembling in fear

211
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,240
Zhao Shenyan is to be excuted for losing the Imperial Seal

212
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,790
Qinglong has lost the same item during his mission in the city

213
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,110
Then

214
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,070
it must be the same Seal that Qinglong has taken back

215
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,790
It's not only the Seal

216
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,990
that Qinglong is after

217
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,270
The fourteenth and the last blade of the Jinyiwei:

218
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,350
Fulfill your mission or, failing that, lay down your life

219
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
Taking back the Seal doesn't just concern you alone

220
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,070
Qinglong, although you are the best fighter among us

221
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,710
There is one thing that we excel in

222
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,550
And that is we know our way

223
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,360
We know routes inside and out

224
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,400
There is no time... so let us help you

225
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,390
Yes

226
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,200
If they stamp the Seal on the forged Scroll

227
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,310
Prince Qing will be able to take his men into the city

228
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,430
The people will suffer a long and painful war

229
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,510
So before the Seal passes through the border

230
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,830
We must take it back

231
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,390
For Tuo Tuo to pass through

232
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,430
She must go through City of Sky Wolves

233
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,510
Prince Qing is careful

234
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,390
He will do everything to aid her

235
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,960
Do you have an idea?

236
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,110
Must draw Tuo Tuo away

237
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,150
Divert their attention and the Seal

238
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,720
City of Sky Wolves is famous for its labyrinthian passage

239
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,710
I know a shortcut

240
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,670
that will enable us to pass them

241
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,870
Brothers we must hurry

242
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
CITY OF SKY WOLVES

243
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,670
Stop

244
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,910
Xuan Wu

245
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,990
You deliver the Seal

246
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,820
I will take care of Qinglong

247
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,880
Let's go

248
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,070
Check it out

249
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,000
HERE LIES THE BODY OF XUAN WU

250
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,710
Have the fire shooters dimount and chase

251
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,430
Up

252
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,150
Go after them   Yes

253
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,470
Let us split up here

254
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,590
Go  Yes

255
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,790
Fire

256
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,680
Cease fire

257
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,390
Retreat

258
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,830
Charge

259
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,390
Charge

260
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,830
The Seal is here

261
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,120
I cannot turn back now

262
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,950
Kill me

263
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,870
Brother

264
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,630
Qinglong, go to Qao Hua quickly

265
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,550
We will handle this here

266
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,110
Qinglong fooled you into dying for him

267
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,990
Here comes the Sky Eagles

268
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,060
Judge

269
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,110
Judge

270
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,710
I said scram

271
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,110
Scram

272
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,710
Tell Qinglong for me

273
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,670
If you see me upon this sandy horizon again

274
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,310
Do not be overyjoyed

275
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,830
It is she that you see

276
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,710
After going through here

277
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,950
You can pass through the border

278
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,270
Aren't you coming with me

279
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,990
The road for a Jinyiwei is short

280
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,030
Mine has come to its end today

281
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,630
You told me

282
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,150
We would deliver the Seal together

283
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,550
And then you would leave with me

284
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,230
I promise you

285
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,790
From now on, if you need me

286
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,430
You only need to ring the bell on your wrist

287
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,310
And I will be there for you

288
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,790
Let me tell you a secret

289
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,110
That day

290
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,230
After I saw my fiance

291
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,110
I came back for you

292
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,070
I wanted to tell you

293
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,150
I have declined the proposal

294
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,390
Whatever you tell me to do

295
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,230
I will do it

296
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,350
No matter if you are lying to me

297
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,350
I will wait for you

298
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,160


299
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,070


300
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,270


301
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,070
After I take care of Tuo Tuo, I will come immediately

302
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,590
Wait for me

303
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,270
Before I complete my task

304
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,520
Whomever stands in my way

305
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,670
No matter friend or foe

306
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,560
Will have to go down first

307
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,110
In the end, I safely delivered the Seal to General of the West

308
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,190
Just like I promised Qinglong

309
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,590
The conspiracy was found out

310
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,870
Prince Qing killed himself before execution

311
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,470
It is rumored

312
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,350
that Prince Qing has never cried in his life

313
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,750
But upon hearing the death of Tuo Tuo

314
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,030
He shed a tear

315
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,990
The people were most thrilled

316
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,070
that the Emperor held court again

317
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,630
Sir Zhao was released

318
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,630
Brother Huang, this way

319
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,310
Yes, boss

320
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,030
Prepare food fast

321
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,920
Must continue after lunch

322
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,390
Hurry, hurry

323
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,710
Before father passed away

324
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,440
he said that Justice Escorts

325
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,470
must remain open

326
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,390
For all that is just and

327
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,230
fair in the world

328
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,830


329
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,310
He also let me know a secret

330
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,310
That his wine is not for bruises and wounds

331
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,790
But for him to remember

332
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,230
The sweet memories of the past

333
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,470
When I drink this wine

334
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,750
I am reminded of a friend I met in the desert

335
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,230
I feel very fortunate to have met him

336
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,390
Because I am witness that the Judge

337
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,600
has turned for the good

338
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,630
Of course, I will also think of him

339
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,110
And the roads we have traveled together

340
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,230
I may not know the ways of the world

341
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,540
He once told me that I only need to ring a bell on my wrist

342
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,230
And he will appear

343
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,830
Whatever he tells me to do, I will do it

344
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,790
No matter if he lying to me or not

345
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,260
It is fortunate to have hope
