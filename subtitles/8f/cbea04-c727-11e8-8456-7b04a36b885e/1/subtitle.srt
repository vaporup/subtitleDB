1
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,790
Dai Minh Khai country,
going from extremity

2
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,500
To strengthen Jiangshan

3
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,870
Emperor set a home network protection
provides security seriously

4
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,950
He trains street orphans under
 a strict totalitarian
regime

5
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,990
Within the law, these
 secret guards bypass
judiciary procedure

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,540
Outside of the court, they 
have their own code of law

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,790
They are called JINYIWEI,
 The Brocade Guards

8
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,830
Their commander

9
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,270
and the best fighter

10
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,950
is given the name QINGLONG

11
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,900
He was granted

12
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,990
the FOURTEEN BLADES

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,870
Inside this box houses 
fourteen different
steel blades

14
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,990
Eight of these blades are marked:

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,350
Sky, Earth, Rank, Law, Wisdom, Trust, 
Benevolence, Bravery

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,870
That are used for interrogation

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,910
The remaining six are used execution

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,070
First to kill those who disobey
the court and the emperor

19
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,070
Second to kill those who interfere
with the imperial administration

20
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,030
Third to kill those who 
practice grafting
and bend the law

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,950
Fourth to kill those who commit treason

22
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,950
Fifth to kill guards who lay their
Jinyiwei brothers

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,830
The last of them, a Golden Sword:

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,820
Fulfill your mission or,
failing that lay down your life

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,460
These orphans are alone in the world

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,230
Under wise rule

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,430
They defend the country

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,790
Yet under fatuous rule

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,830
They become a walking terror to
the people

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,390
In JINYIWEI are involved in highly
military and political affairs

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,590
When missions go awry, they often
lose their lives

32
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:15,120
Meeting their sorrowful fate

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,120
THE NORTH
PRINCE QING'S ROYAL CITY

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Prince Qing is the uncle of the
Emperor

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,000
During the last Emperor's reign, he led the army in a failed revolt

36
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,800
Which cost him both his legs

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,500
And resulting in his exile

38
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,830
My Lord

39
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,870
All is arranged regarding our plan

40
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,350
has presented an satisfied

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,110
with Jia Jingzhong

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,430
But I am digusted at the thought of his greedy face

43
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,270
More disgusting is the fact that

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,790
he is the reason I am still alive

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,790
Indeed you've given him what you've promised

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,750
Now he even wants more

47
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,190
Greedy souls are what I'm after

48
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,670
Money is countable

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,030
Nothing but some numbers

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,390
What I loathe are unsettled debts

51
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,280
THE FORBIDDEN CITY QIANQING PALACE

52
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,070
Your loyal slave Jia Jingzhong

53
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,030
is here to wish your Majesty a long and healthful life

54
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,030
Tuo is here, noble Father

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,820
Tuo Tuo

56
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,910
Do you know why I have called for you?

57
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,710
I shall fulfill your wish, my beloved, adoptive Father

58
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,430
My Lord

59
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,500
JINYIWEI HEADQUARTERS

60
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,590
Qinglong

61
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,750
Our kingdom is under siege

62
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,740
Zhao Shenyan is conspiring to revolt

63
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,670
You must reclaim the treasure box that the emperor has bestowed upon him

64
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,550
In it is solid proff of his treason

65
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,270
Do you have the Emperor's Order

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,750
General Qinglong, bow to your order

67
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,750
Emperor Secret Order

68
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,910
Counselor Zhao Shenyan is conspiring to revolt

69
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,230
The Emperor has ordered for Jinyiwei Qinglong to execute the mission

70
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,870
Bai Hu and Zhu Que

71
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,550
will take lead in your absence

72
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,470
Xuan Wu will be re-stationed at the East Chamber

73
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,270
With his Majesty's Royal Blessing

74
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,150
General Qinglong receives his Majesty's Order

75
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,500
THE COUNSELOR'S RESIDENCE

76
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,630
Father, I am afraid

77
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,990
It is alright, Shouzheng

78
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,030
Shenyan

79
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,270
Let us leave together

80
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,270
Madame, I cannot do that

81
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,230
Is it because of the box

82
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,270
It must be the Jinyiwei

83
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,310
General Huang

84
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,030
You must escort Madame out of the city tonight

85
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,750
Yes

86
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,950
Father...Father

87
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,950
Father...

88
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,560
promise me

89
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,870
You must come for us

90
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,190
I promise you son

91
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,270
Father...don't forget

92
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,030
Now quickly, to the study

93
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,670
Mum, I'm afraid

94
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,510
Don't be afraid

95
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,310
Brothers

96
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,430
Do not make me strike

97
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,870
Kill

98
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,020
Councilor

99
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,510
please hand over his Majesty's treasure box

100
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,070
You should know

101
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,190
I would rather die

102
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,270
than surrender

103
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,310
to this corrupt court

104
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,310
Show yourself

105
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,350
Shouzheng

106
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,670
Father..Father

107
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,670
Let him go, let him go

108
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,060
You are despicable

109
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,950
I know I will not get it out of you

110
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,190
Forgive me, for I am here on a mission

111
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,510
I'll have to ask him

112
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,790
Shouzheng, don't be afraid

113
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,800
Listen to me

114
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,940
Shouzheng, he is lying to you

115
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,950
Tell me

116
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,230
Shouzheng, you must not tell

117
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,310
I said you must not tell

118
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,190
I didn't tell

119
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,590
Uncle said he will grant me any wish

120
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,190
I said..

121
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,590
I said

122
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,870
I wanted you back

123
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,270
Did Jia Jingzhong not tell you

124
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,110
the Imperial Seal is in the box

125
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,310
Qinglong

126
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,860
Did you ever think

127
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,590
If this seal were to fall into the wrong hands

128
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,870
How many lives

129
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,300
would be sacrificed and killed

130
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,350
Enough

131
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,110
To protect this Seal

132
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,390
It is your duty as Jinyiwei

133
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,310
Greetings to General Xuan Wu

134
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,350
Xuan Wu

135
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,040
Xuan Wu

136
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,870
You bastard

137
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,670
Let me out if you dare

138
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,510
I will kill you

139
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,900
Xuan Wu

140
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,070
You are wasting your breath

141
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,580
Kill them

142
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,860
Xuan Wu, when people see the glory of your success

143
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,620
They will forget the sinister nature of your means

144
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,190
I was right

145
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,790
Guards, release Bai Hu

146
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,630
Tuo Tuo is here on behalf of my Father

147
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,630
Coming to Sir Jia's aid

148
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,310
We know of Qinglong's escape and to avoid unnecesary trouble

149
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,670
I will help Sir Jia to get rid of Qinglong

150
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,990
Do you have proof

151
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,950
That you are indeed Prince Qing's daughter

152
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,590
Yours

153
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,710

154
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,670

156
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,670
You even give us the dowry

157
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,430
When they come for you

158
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,780
What will you give them

159
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,470
Don't worry

160
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,670
I can handle it

161
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,950

We are disbanded

164
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,670
What about this flag

165
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,950
Keep it

166
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,880
There won't be...

167
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,670
a Justice Escorts ever again

168
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,540
We could have kept going

169
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,780
We have been in debt too long

170
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,910
We can't possible keep up

171
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,910

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,470
We are all getting old

173
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,150
I could come with you

174
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,630
Father

175
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,340
I don't want to marry

176
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,310
Haven't the debtors already come?

177
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,430
We said we would pay them in two days

178
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,110

179
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,710

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,950
When all is done

186
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,340
You get an additional three hundred

187
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,830

00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,670
Quickly

194
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,150
Everyone

195
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,870
is to be searched thoroughly today

196
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,630
Wait

197
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,990
Sir Yang

198
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,070
Boss Yong

199
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,790
Why all the strict searching today

200
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,750
What happened

201
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,060
Jinyiwei Qinglong

202
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,470
is on arrest for treason

203
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,790
The Emperor has ordered

204
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,150
execution to anyone

205
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,550
who let him go at the gate

206
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,710


207
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,350


208
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,180
My daughter is getting married

209
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,080
Married

210
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,230
Didn't she get married last year

211
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,110


212
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,950
Let's

213
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,390
not talk about it

214
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,350
Oh.. right, right

215
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,550
Sir Yang, won't you help us out

216
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,020
We are in a hurry

217
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,390
Please let us through

218
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,150
Surely

219
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,910
But I'll have to search first

220
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,390
Sir Yang

221
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,710
Sir Yang

222
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,150


223
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,350
Uncle Yang

224
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,110
My niece is prettier every time I see

225
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,910
Uncle Yang, you sure know how to joke

226
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,110
Alright, I've searched this one

227
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,070
Turn around, I'll escort you myself

228
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,030
You can let go of my hand

229
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,630
If it doesn't work out this time either

230
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,150
you should marry me

231
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,230
Quick

232
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,830
Come on

233
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,950
Go

234
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,550
Boss, it's our own wine

235
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,390
Give some to everyone

236
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,150
Order from Boss, we've had a long day

237
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,790
Sir, have some food

238
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,880
This is aged wine specially brewed

239
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,150
It is good for bruises

240
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,910
Have some

241
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,350
It will be good to your wounds

242
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,870
My Father started brewing this since he founded Justice

243
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,390
It's been forty-six years

244
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,270
When I was young,

245
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,190
I couldn't understand

246
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,310
When I grew older

247
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,590
and watched him

248
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,910
tolerating the ways of this world

249
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,590
I finally understood that the wine didn't help him

250
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,710
with bruises and wounds

251
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,660
I want to help him

252
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,590
But he refuses me

253
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,190
If it weren't for my marriage

254
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,830
He would never have let me come

255
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,630
I really wish

256
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,990
A hero in this world

257
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,430
Can take over Justice

258
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,470
What fragrant wine

259
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,830
Who...

260
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,470
is the boss around here

261
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,590
It's me. Qiao Yong from Justice Escorts in the city

262
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,030
We are new here, excuse us

263
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,110
We are the Sky Eagle Clan

264
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,430
He is the famous

265
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,710
"Blade Number One" The Judge of the Desert

266
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,150
Today, we Sky Eagles give you face

267
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,390
Why do people like to bully others Eighty taels of white silver

268
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,350
You will not pass if it is one tael less

269
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,150
Right

270
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,790
Has this world changed?

271
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,910
Must we common folk live without any respect and dignity?

272
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,980
Do not touch my flag

273
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,790
Flag Bearer

274
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,110
Boss

275
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,030
Dignity is within oneself

276
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,750
No one can take it away from you

277
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,270
Don't

278
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,910
You're risking your life

279
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,910
Charge

280
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,310
Who's there

281
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,110
Charge

282
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,310
Who would have thought

283
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,740
I didn't see

284
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,270
Sorry, boss

285
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,510
Sorry, boss... retreat

286
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,430
Boss, I saw the Jinyiwei plaque around
his wait with my own eyes

287
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,510
Go, go go..

288
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,270
Don't

289
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,150
He is in the carriage

290
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,270
I've been waiting for you

291
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,590
Jinyiwei Formation

292
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,590
Do you know I was the one who created this

293
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,590
Qiao Hua

294
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,590
Let me go

295
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,070
 Let me go

296
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,990
Let me go

297
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,830
Jinyiwei Qinglong

298
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,950
Sir Jia thinks too highly of you

299
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,460
He's Qinglong

300
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,790
First kill, interfering with the higher power

301
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,550
Second kill, brother killing brother

302
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,860
I'll tell...I'll tell

303
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,590
It was Xuan Wu...he made me come after you

304
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,070
Who killed Bai Hu and Zhu Que?

305
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,830
Xuan Wu killed Zhu Que

306
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,550
Bia Hu was killed

307
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,390
by a girl from the West

308
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,270
sent by Prince Qing

309
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,630
Her sword was incredibly quick

310
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,470
Her name is Tuo Tuo

311
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,180
Go back to Jia Jingzhong

312
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,950
Tell him there's no longer a Qinglong from Jinyiwei

313
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,270
Tell him to leave me alone

314
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,310
Yes yes yes

315
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,190
Scram

316
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,710
Scram

317
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,750
Since you are a Jinyiwei

318
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,590
Our services to you end here

319
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,990
Your money

320
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,310
Please take it back

321
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,750
You will not harm my father

322
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,230
Let's talk about it

323
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,030
I only have one daughter

324
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,550
Please I beg you

325
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,030
You must travel to the East

326
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,950
And casually mention my name wherever you visit

327
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,470
to divert attention away from me

328
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,670
3 days later, at Cotton Village

329
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,630
You will have two choices

330
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,310
One

331
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,950
Have your daughter back

332
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,670
Two

333
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,150
Have her corpse back

334
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,550
Father..Father

335
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,710
Qiao Hua... Qiao Hua

336
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,590
Father, Father

337
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,910
You were peeking

338
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,030
I need to pee

339
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,590
What are you doing

340
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,310
Go

341
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,310
You may eat after you finish daming

342
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,750
We have guests

343
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,670
Papa, look

344
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,310
Come on, have a hug

345
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,110
Take a seat

346
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,310
Sir and Miss

347
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,870
We have some excellent broiled beef here,
would you like to try some

348
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,350
Yes, could we have half a kilo please

349
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,830
Let's have some on the juicy side, it would smell lovely

350
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,580
We also have some stewed goat's hooves in garlic

351
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,510
We'll have half a kilo of that too

352
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,710
Could you put more onion in it

353
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,070
Goat is a bit much for me

354
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,230
Surely

355
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,820
We have some grape wine as well

356
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,150
We don't want grape wine

357
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,150
I don't want wine from the West either

358
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,310
Half a kilo of white wine

359
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,510
We're hungry...get on it

360
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,230
Right away

361
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,190
Yes

362
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,110
Please enjoy

363
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,980
I may not know the ways of the world,
but I know my way around the table

364
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,110
I can't eat if you touch it..

365
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,430
take this

366
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,420
Check please

367
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,950
Everything Satisfactory, sir and miss

368
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,590
Yes

369
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,390
We have unbeatable prices too... just on tael and four pence

370
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,950
I don't have money

371
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,910
I'm your hostage

372
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,670
I gave it all to your father

373
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,950
Do you have money or not?

374
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,870
I knew by the looks of you two

375
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,550
That is was too good to be true

376
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,190
Boss, you just wait. I'm taking them to the guards

377
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,870
Wait just one minute

378
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,150
Do you know who he is

379
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,870
He is a Jin...

380
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,830
My family name is Jin

381
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,390
I'm sorry, we really don't have money with us

382
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,790
I hope this gold medallion will be enough

383
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,430
I knew that you had it all along, I'll get you change right away

384
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,270
What are you doing

385
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,750
We could have easily bought ten horses
with the money you gave them

386
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,390
Is Qinglong your real name

387
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,030
This is what they call me.. I don't have a name

388
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,510
How did you become a Jinyiwei

389
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,150
Brother

390
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,710
Brother

391
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,430
Brother, brother

392
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,020
I have no choice

393
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,550
Don't you think it is a sin

394
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,830
to have killed so many

395
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,070
I never ask why

396
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,980
I only ask when, where and who

397
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,100
Have you thought of quitting

398
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,550
There is no quitting in the life of a Jinyiwei

399
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,140
Our path is a short one

400
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,550
I will be done soon

401
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,710
If no one is after you

402
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,630
You could leave

403
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,110
To finish a mission is the only dignity for a Jinyiwei

404
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,070
Knowing fully well

405
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,630
my fiance is cheating behind my back

406
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,030
Having to feign ignorace and go forth with a wedding

407
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,670
How's that for no dignity

408
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,630
I wanted to devote myself to a man I love

409
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,590
But alas, his heart is not mine to have

410
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,150
I also wish for

411
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,150
a hero in this world

412
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,750
But alas, he kills without compassion

413
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,740
Still I have hope for the future

414
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,150
My mother used to tell me

415
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,910
It is fortunate to have hope

416
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,190
Everyone has chosen their own path

417
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,030
Quiglong, taht goes for you too

418
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,990
As long as you keep walking

419
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,750
You will see blue sky

420
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,620
Take this food

421
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,190
to the table

422
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,950
Go now

423
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,550


424
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,070
Here is our honey chicken

425
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,380
And this is toasted bread

426
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,550
And here, is our home brew wine

427
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,870
Let me know if you need anything else

428
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Scram

429
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,230
Sir

430
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,540
Has the secret document arrived?

431
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,150
Yes it has

432
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,150


433
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,910
Let's get you some new clothes

434
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,020
Miss, you look gorgeous in this

435
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,790
It suits you well

436
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,830
Why don't you try this head scart too.. they match together

437
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,940
You look pretty

438
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,660
Try on another

439
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,750
I think this one looks even better

440
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,550
Can you do something for me

441
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:05,790
What is it

442
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:06,910
Go to the guard post

443
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,390
And find a man call Jia Jingzhong

444
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,870
If they ask you who you are

445
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,630
Give them this letter

446
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,070
But a woman walking into a guard post...

447
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,030
You'll look like a man in this

448
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,590
I have something else to take care of

449
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,430
I will come for you afterwards

450
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:33,990
Yes

451
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,590
What are you here for

452
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,910
I am here for Jia Jingzhong

453
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,310
Who are you

454
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,870
Surround him

455
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,980
Qinglong

456
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,670
When you could stay in heaven

457
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,950
Why invite yourself to hell

458
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,630
There is no quitting in the life of a JInyiwei

459
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:45,150
There is no quitting in the life of a Jinyiwei

460
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,300
What business do you ahve with Sir Jia

461
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,060
We Jinyiwei

462
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,230
never ask why

463
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,910
Only when, where, and who

464
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,270
Jia Jingzhong is planning to sell the three districts

465
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,640
And the gold will be delivered by Captain Xiahou himself

466
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,750
The twelfth day of this month

467
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,590
That is today

468
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,230
Qinglong, do you think you can do
whatever you want around here

469
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,270
To finish a mission

470
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,190
is the only dignity for a Jinyiwei

471
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,510
Capture him

00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,510

473
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,630

480
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,340
Did I ask for your help?

481
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,950
