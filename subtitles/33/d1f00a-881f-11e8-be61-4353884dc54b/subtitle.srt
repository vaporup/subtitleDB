{6739}{6839}Happy birthday, Daddy!
{7029}{7067}Make a wish!
{7073}{7123}I wish...|I'm not going to tell you.
{7129}{7211}Come on, blow them out!
{7296}{7339}Give me some sugar, girl.
{7345}{7453}One more candle and the smoke alarm|would've gone off.
{7521}{7594}The big 5-0.
{7600}{7685}You know, your beard's getting gray.|Kind of makes you look old.
{7691}{7763}It's all right. I still love you.
{7769}{7839}Bye, Pa.
{10393}{10458}Good morning!
{10464}{10556}- Where's Rianne?|- She's upstairs.
{10562}{10602}Good morning.
{10608}{10656}- That's my bacon!|- It's mine now.
{10662}{10713}Don't you close doors around here?
{10719}{10790}Baby, what's this on my tie?
{10796}{10834}That is an ugly spot.
{10840}{10894}Thanks. Sharp as a tack.
{10900}{10966}I'm thinking of going on "Jeopardy".
{10972}{11067}Just don't take any questions|about cooking.
{11136}{11203}Don't step in the egg!
{11209}{11329}What am I thinking? I should have|checked the floor for egg!
{11336}{11458}Do you know a man named|Michael Hunsaker?
{11493}{11543}Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!
{11549}{11597}- What did he want?|- Your office called.
{11603}{11654}He's tried to reach you|for three days.
{11660}{11741}I haven't talked to him in...
{11747}{11793}...12 years!
{11799}{11830}Wait a minute.
{11836}{11902}That would make me...
{11908}{11950}...50!
{11956}{12011}That means that you're...
{12017}{12054}We're not gonna discuss it.
{12060}{12137}Forget the eggs.
{12188}{12244}How come I never heard|of Michael Hunsaker?
{12250}{12291}Just never talked about him.
{12297}{12334}Vietnam buddy?
{12340}{12425}Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.
{12433}{12476}Nick and the kids|left without me.
{12482}{12564}He left without you? Come on,|I never get enough of my baby.

{12664}{12734}It's beautiful.
{12743}{12824}Have a good birthday.
{12992}{13069}Goddamn heartbreaker!
{13822}{13920}{y:i}A lot of people think|{y:i}this is a Superbowl. They're wrong.

{18016}{18054}How good a shot is he?
{18060}{18135}- What do you mean?|- Is he random or specific?
{18141}{18170}He shot at random.
{18176}{18210}- You make the weapon?|- Automatic.

{21300}{21334}We got a hooker.
{21340}{21430}No, it's Dixie. Would you please|tell these bozos to lay off?
{21436}{21462}You bozos, lay off.
{21468}{21534}Had a jumper here last night.|She saw it happen.
{21540}{21586}Get her statement, send her home.
{21592}{21667}Thanks. I'm beat.|You know how it is.
{21673}{21731}All dressed up, no one to blow.

{22242}{22291}You know them?
{22297}{22370}Right. Find out who bought it,|who's paying the bills.
{22376}{22475}- That will take some looking into.|- So look!
{23087}{23143}Hello, honey.
{23149}{23210}Give me the number|for Michael Hunsaker.
{23216}{23279}{y:i}The man we talked about?|{y:i}Your Vietnam buddy?

{24033}{24116}Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?
{24153}{24231}- Yeah, that's good.|- You better fucking believe it.
{24237}{24277}Let's do it. How much?
{24283}{24336}How much for how much?
{24342}{24370}For all of it.
{24376}{24449}You want it all? He wants it all.
{24455}{24538}- All right!|- Maybe a nice tree to put it under.
{24544}{24579}You want a tree?
{24585}{24623}I'll tell you what.
{24629}{24707}I'll give you the best tree|on the lot for nothing.
{24713}{24775}But the shit's gonna cost you...
{24781}{24810}...a hundred.
{24816}{24838}That much?
{24844}{24923}That's a fair price.
{24943}{24988}You only live once.
{24994}{25054}Get this together here.

{25139}{25241}- What the fuck?|- Hey, man!
{25247}{25284}Shut up, I'm losing count.
{25290}{25355}93, 94, 95, 96...
{25361}{25401}Forget it, dumbshit!
{25407}{25451}One hundred thousand!
{25457}{25543}One hundred thousand dollars!
{25549}{25587}A hundred thousand?
{25593}{25703}I can't afford that. Not on my salary.|But look, I got a better idea.
{25709}{25836}Let me say I take the whole stash|off your hands for free...
{25842}{25950}...and you assholes go to jail.|What do you say?
{25957}{26094}I could read you your rights, but you|already know what your rights are.
{26148}{26188}This badge ain't real.
{26194}{26220}You ain't real.
{26226}{26321}You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.
{26342}{26386}I'm crazy?
{26392}{26440}You think I am crazy?
{26446}{26522}I'll show you...
{26573}{26669}That's a real badge, I'm a real cop|and this is a real gun.
{26675}{26701}Okay, pal.

{28008}{28096}Shoot me! Shoot him!
{28240}{28303}Get him out of there.
{28309}{28382}It ain't worth it.
{28840}{28895}Come on, Sam. Thattaboy.
{28901}{28977}Hey, guys.
{28999}{29097}Up you go, Sam. Come on.
{29131}{29183}How you been there, Sam?
{29189}{29228}Been catching mice today?
{29234}{29274}What kind of a day did you have?
{29280}{29346}You haven't been doing anything,|lazy son of a bitch.
{29352}{29477}I'll get you a sandwich,|because that's all there is.
{29496}{29553}Beer for me.
{29559}{29654}Looks like turkey.|I got us a surprise.
{29660}{29790}Thirteen-inch color TV set.|We can watch reruns of "Lassie".
{29796}{29868}Hey, wait up already!
{33362}{33439}{y:i}Merry Christmas!
{34080}{34160}I miss you...
{34187}{34264}...Victoria Lynn.
{34562}{34647}That's silly, isn't it?
{34749}{34829}I'll see you later.
{34836}{34919}I'll see you much later.
{35030}{35111}Once more with feeling on three.
{35117}{35250}Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,|or go on the street.
{35324}{35404}{y:i}Silent night
{35410}{35475}Are you telling me|Riggs is playing a game?
{35481}{35563}Sure. He wants the cash.|But he'll come around.
{35569}{35623}That's a very dangerous|attitude to take.
{35629}{35744}Remember, his wife of 11 years|was just killed in a car accident.
{35750}{35841}- He pulls his gun when he shouldn't.|- I know all about him.
{35847}{35875}He's a tough bastard.
{35881}{35958}He's on the edge. I'm telling you,|he may be psychotic.
{35964}{36010}That's a bunch of psych bullshit.
{36016}{36087}You're making a mistake|by keeping him in the field.
{36093}{36133}The man is suicidal.
{36139}{36207}You're sure of that diagnosis?|You have no doubts?
{36213}{36253}There are no absolutes in life.
{36259}{36323}End of discussion.|We're going to wait.
{36329}{36391}If he offs himself,|then we'll know I was wrong.
{36397}{36514}You're making a mistake,|because if you're wrong...
{36649}{36696}Asshole!
{36702}{36765}Roger, you're|way behind the times.
{36771}{36868}The guys in the '80s aren't tough.|They're sensitive people.
{36874}{36983}They show emotions around women,|shit like that.
{36988}{37025}I think I'm an '80s man.
{37031}{37067}How do you figure?
{37073}{37111}Last night...
{37117}{37202}...I cried in bed. How's that?
{37238}{37283}Were you with a woman?
{37289}{37372}I was alone. Why do you think|I was crying? Merry Christmas.
{37378}{37443}Sounds like an '80s man to me.
{37449}{37505}- News on the Hunsaker case.|- That was quick.
{37511}{37602}So was the autopsy.|They're not calling it a suicide.
{37608}{37713}Surprise, surprise. The coroner|found evidence she used barbiturates.
{37719}{37754}Brilliant detective work.
{37760}{37802}There were pills all over.
{37808}{37866}Right. That's not the surprise.
{37872}{37939}The surprise is|the pills were doctored.
{37945}{38004}The capsules were loaded|with drain cleaner.
{38010}{38038}She'd have died anyway.
{38044}{38068}This case stinks.
{38074}{38173}You know,|you looked younger with the beard.
{38179}{38249}Thanks, captain.
{38256}{38287}You shaved the beard.
{38293}{38330}Some detective.
{38336}{38383}Two more things.
{38389}{38450}The condition|of the sheets indicates...
{38456}{38527}...someone else was|in bed with Amanda. That's "A".
{38533}{38558}What's "B"?
{38564}{38645}"B" is, you're breaking in|a new partner on this.
{38651}{38675}Partner again?
{38681}{38766}Some cat on loan from Dope.|Real burnout, on the edge.
{38772}{38834}Perfect.
{38860}{38920}Gun!
{39049}{39127}Rog, meet your new partner.
{39181}{39282}I'm too old for this shit.
{39348}{39407}There are those who|say you're a good cop.
{39413}{39457}I try.
{39463}{39596}I heard about the little|stunt yesterday. Pretty heroic.
{39613}{39655}I pulled your file.
{39661}{39750}Said you worked in the Phoenix|project in Vietnam. That right?
{39756}{39833}Assassination stuff.|It's over, you know.
{39839}{39881}What is?
{39887}{39911}The war.
{39917}{39957}Yes, I know.
{39963}{40040}Just thought I'd remind you.
{40054}{40139}That's some serious shit you carry.
{40145}{40222}Be my guest.
{40301}{40393}9mm Beretta. Takes 15 in the mag,|one up the pipe...
{40399}{40489}...wide ejection port, no feed jams.
{40495}{40521}What have you got?
{40527}{40591}Four-inch Smith.
{40591}{40654}Six-shooter?
{40655}{40730}A lot of old-timers carry those.
{40798}{40861}File also said you're heavy|into martial arts.
{40867}{40950}Tai chi and all that killer stuff.
{40956}{41049}I suppose we have to register you|as a lethal weapon.
{41055}{41147}Let's just cut the shit.|We both know why I was transferred.
{41153}{41257}Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,|so nobody wants to work with me.
{41263}{41322}Some think I'm faking|to draw psycho pension...
{41328}{41422}...so nobody wants to work with me.|Basically, I'm fucked.
{41428}{41457}Guess what?
{41463}{41497}I don't want to work with you.
{41503}{41525}Then don't.
{41531}{41628}Ain't got no choice.|Looks like we both got fucked.
{41634}{41694}Terrific.
{41758}{41821}God hates me is what it is.
{41827}{41917}Hate him back. It works for me.
{42314}{42373}- Good afternoon, Mr. Mendez.|- How you doing?
{42379}{42409}Did you pat him down?
{42415}{42481}- We went through this already.|- Go through it again.
{42487}{42518}Who are you?
{42524}{42595}That's hardly important,|but you may call me Mr. Joshua.
{42601}{42625}Let's go.
{42631}{42724}Great, swell. Mr. Joshua, huh?
{42801}{42884}General, Mr. Mendez is here.
{42935}{43029}You call this music? I can get|a better band for half the price.
{43035}{43160}I don't want to hear any of this shit.|Let's get it right.
{43177}{43231}Mr. Mendez, how are you?
{43237}{43274}I'm fine.
{43280}{43338}Where did you get him?|Psychos "R" Us?
{43344}{43377}I don't think you're funny.
{43383}{43449}I don't think this whole|goddamn setup is funny.
{43455}{43523}You're using mercenaries.|Tell me I'm wrong!
{43529}{43561}You're not wrong.
{43567}{43622}And you expect me to trust these bozos?
{43628}{43685}My people are loyal to me.
{43691}{43730}Bullshit.
{43736}{43763}Do you smoke?
{43769}{43817}What does that have to do with it?
{43823}{43881}Do you smoke?!
{43898}{43936}Give me your lighter.
{43942}{43989}- My lighter?|- Your lighter!
{43995}{44036}Okay. Right here.
{44042}{44067}Here. Take it.
{44073}{44141}What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
{44147}{44178}Shut your mouth!
{44184}{44221}Shut up!
{44227}{44296}And don't move.
{44359}{44457}Mr. Joshua, your left arm, please.
{44631}{44733}Hey, you guys are fucking gone.|You know what I am saying?
{44739}{44805}Jesus Christ, man!
{44811}{44928}You guys are fucking|crazy, man. Come on!
{45005}{45093}Have Endo look at that, Mr. Joshua.
{45106}{45166}Yes, sir.
{45172}{45223}You wish to do business with us, yes?
{45229}{45257}Jesus Christ!
{45263}{45346}You wish to make a purchase, yes?
{45352}{45441}Yes, yes! Jesus Christ, yes.
{45461}{45545}You guys are out there like|fucking Pluto, man. You're gone!
{45551}{45651}The heroin will be here Friday night.|We'll make delivery at that time.
{45657}{45709}Have the money ready, and no tricks.
{45715}{45817}If you try anything,|you'll have to talk to Mr. Joshua.
{45823}{45897}Right. Joshua. I got you.
{45903}{45938}Merry Christmas.
{45944}{46052}Yeah, right. You too, pal.
{46297}{46349}Mike...
{46355}{46486}...the autopsy report showed|that Amanda was poisoned.
{46492}{46586}Even if she hadn't jumped,|she'd still be dead.
{46591}{46692}She was murdered.
{46761}{46832}Jesus!
{46902}{47009}I can't take this.|I just can't take this.
{47068}{47156}Why did you try|to get in touch with me?
{47211}{47285}I heard that you were...
{47291}{47396}Somebody told me you were|working out here.
{47413}{47466}I thought you could get her out.
{47472}{47547}Get her out of what?
{47580}{47699}Get her out of the stuff she was into.|She was making...
{47705}{47776}...videotapes.
{47784}{47841}Pornographic...
{47847}{47897}...videotapes.
{47903}{48037}I thought maybe you could just|get her out. Help her.
{48331}{48400}Easy, Mike.
{48530}{48594}You owe me, Roger.
{48600}{48661}Remember?
{48802}{48848}I remember.
{48854}{48953}I want you to find whoever's|responsible for this...
{48959}{49052}...however many of them there are.
{49080}{49174}I know you can do it.|Just find them and kill them.
{49180}{49213}I'm a police officer.
{49219}{49295}I don't give a shit|that you're a police officer!
{49301}{49366}Kill them! Just kill them!
{49372}{49414}Wait. Wait, Rog.
{49420}{49480}Come on. You find them|and you kill them.
{49486}{49597}You can do that. You owe me.
{49657}{49726}I owe you.
{49740}{49817}Gotta go, man.
{49961}{50026}What did he mean|when he said you owed him?

{50097}{50186}La Drang Valley. Saved my life.|Took a bayonet in the lungs.
{50192}{50258}- That was nice of him.|- I thought so.
{50264}{50339}- Want me to drive?|- You're supposed to be suicidal.

{52429}{52510}He's over there on the ledge.
{52746}{52795}Merry Christmas.
{52801}{52856}Leave me alone!
{52862}{52889}What are you doing?
{52895}{52941}None of your damn business!
{52947}{52994}Fair enough.
{53000}{53065}I'm just going to|come out there, okay?
{53071}{53169}Don't!|You touch me, I'm gonna jump!
{53172}{53222}Take it easy, for chrissake!
{53228}{53296}I don't like this|any better than you do.
{53302}{53345}I can't stand heights.
{53351}{53380}This makes me dizzy.
{53386}{53482}Just give me a chance|to talk to you.
{53511}{53565}I'm gonna stand|on the ledge with you.
{53571}{53646}Don't go. Not out on the ledge.
{53652}{53734}You're not the first guy|to think of this, you know.
{53740}{53819}A lot of people got problems|during this season.
{53825}{53895}- You know shit!|- No, you're wrong, pal.
{53901}{53958}You know nothing! Don't touch me!
{53964}{54002}I didn't do anything wrong!
{54008}{54078}I know that. It's not like|you're murdering anyone.
{54084}{54135}- That's right!|- That's right.
{54141}{54200}The only one I hurt is me! Me!
{54206}{54291}That's right. I know|you're hurting. I get it.
{54297}{54337}Don't come near me!
{54343}{54400}Give me a break.|My boss is watching me.
{54406}{54489}I got to make it look|like I'm trying to save you.
{54495}{54552}Come on.
{54554}{54646}I'm just gonna stand here|and talk to you. That's all.
{54652}{54711}You won't try nothing?
{54717}{54776}I'm square with you.|I won't try a thing.
{54782}{54904}You think I want to fall off?|I promise, I'll just talk to you.
{54910}{54944}All right.
{54950}{55064}Here, you want a cigarette?|Come on, let's smoke, okay?
{55070}{55096}Go on, take it.
{55102}{55195}Take our time and both die of cancer.
{55548}{55588}See this key?
{55594}{55630}Bye-bye!
{55636}{55661}You're crazy!
{55667}{55762}You can jump, but you'd take me|with you, making you a murderer.
{55768}{55820}- You bastard!|- You'd be killing a cop.
{55826}{55863}Yeah, a psycho nut cop!
{55869}{55920}I'm still a cop.|You coming in?
{55926}{55988}- I'm jumping!|- Do you really want to jump?
{55994}{56077}Do you want to?|That's fine with me. Come on!
{56083}{56121}Let's do it, asshole.
{56127}{56203}I want to do it.
{56475}{56543}Shit!
{56685}{56723}You want to go up again?
{56729}{56807}Come on, it was great.
{56826}{56889}Help me! Help me loose!
{56895}{56937}He's trying to kill me!
{56943}{57024}Did you see that?|He's out of his mind! He's crazy!
{57030}{57084}I want my cuffs back.
{57090}{57164}- Don't you touch me!|- What the fuck did you just do?
{57170}{57246}I controlled the jump!|You wanted him down? He's down!
{57252}{57284}Come here!
{57290}{57364}Come here with me!
{57590}{57649}Get in here!
{57731}{57826}Okay, no bullshit!|You want to kill yourself?
{57832}{57897}Shut up! Yes or no?|You want to die?
{57903}{57945}I got the job done!
{57951}{57994}Just answer the question!
{58000}{58045}What do you want to hear, man?
{58051}{58140}That sometimes I think about|eating a bullet?
{58146}{58176}Well, I do!
{58182}{58261}I got a special one for the occasion,|with a hollow point.
{58267}{58351}Make sure it blows|the back of my goddamn head out!
{58357}{58431}Every day I wake up and think|of a reason not to do it.
{58437}{58501}Every single day.
{58507}{58586}And you know why I don't?|This is gonna make you laugh.
{58592}{58673}The job. Doing the job.|That's the reason.
{58679}{58766}- You want to die!|- I don't. I'm not afraid of it.
{58772}{58863}Here, take my gun. Don't nibble|on the barrel, pull the trigger.
{58869}{58930}Be my guest!|Go ahead, if you're serious!
{58936}{58991}You shouldn't tempt me.
{58997}{59091}In your mouth. Bullet may go|through your ear and not kill you.
{59097}{59182}Under the chin's just as good!
{59552}{59663}You're not trying|to draw a psycho pension.
{59667}{59752}You really are crazy.
{59821}{59958}I'm hungry. I'm gonna go|and get something to eat.
{60180}{60304}{y:i}I don't know. He's hurting. There's|{y:i}something eating away at this guy.
{60310}{60420}{y:i}I think he's on the edge.|{y:i}I think Riggs has a death wish.
{60426}{60540}Terrific. So you're|saying I should worry?
{60546}{60585}I think you should worry.
{60591}{60646}{y:i}When he goes,|{y:i}you don't want to be near him.
{60652}{60725}Thank you, doctor.|You've been very helpful.
{60731}{60802}You're welcome.
{60882}{60977}I'm too old for this shit.
{61006}{61035}You hungry?
{61041}{61089}No! I'm not hungry.
{61095}{61156}- Want me to drive?|- No! I'll drive!
{61162}{61188}Get in that side!
{61194}{61262}You drive.
{61395}{61514}You get a bad personal call? What|is it? Did the stock market crash?
{61520}{61612}Don't worry. Here, have a French fry.
{61730}{61832}Fifty years old. What a birthday.|Fifty years old!
{61838}{61956}Been on the force 20 years, not|a scratch on me. Got a wife, kids...
{61962}{62078}...house, boat. I can kiss it all|goodbye because of your death wish.
{62084}{62108}My life is over.
{62114}{62153}Would you just shut up here?
{62159}{62267}Why are you talking to me anyway?|I'm a dead man!
{62271}{62397}I was driving before you were|an itch in your daddy's pants.
{62471}{62511}- I didn't know that.|- Know what?
{62517}{62584}That it was your birthday today.
{62590}{62640}It was yesterday.
{62646}{62752}Well, happy birthday for yesterday.
{62791}{62841}Sincerely. Happy birthday, man.
{62847}{62911}Thanks.
{62938}{63067}Maybe we'll stay alive long enough|for me to buy you a present.
{63085}{63128}Don't thank me now.
{63134}{63267}It's the least I can do after|all the kindness you've shown me.
{63532}{63610}Are you gonna tell me|where we're going?
{63616}{63669}Are we together on this?
{63675}{63780}Beverly Hills. We got an address|on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.
{63786}{63846}Remember, he's not a suspect yet.
{63852}{63909}So we question him, not damage him.
{63915}{63976}I won't hurt. You do all the talking.
{63982}{64016}Let me do all the talking.
{64022}{64106}Experience counts here.
{64134}{64243}- You're not going to smoke in the car.|- Well, I am.
{64244}{64289}What? Does this bother you?
{64295}{64316}It bothers me.
{64322}{64397}- Does it?|- Yeah.
{64401}{64441}I'll open a window.
{64447}{64576}That's not the point. I have to watch|out for my lungs, take care of myself.
{64582}{64635}4241 coming up.
{64641}{64697}Bingo.
{64703}{64805}- Do we have a warrant?|- We don't need one with the gate club.
{64811}{64897}Didn't take them long, huh?
{64957}{65027}Hey, guys, go on in!|Make yourselves at home!
{65033}{65101}Merry Christmas!
{65124}{65217}Don't need a warrant|with an invitation.
{65222}{65342}I saw this place on|"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless".
{65542}{65613}Get the door.
{65862}{65947}Nice and easy.
{65978}{66083}- Looks like the Garden of Eden.|- Look at this!
{66089}{66161}Paradise.
{66202}{66245}Isn't that sweet?
{66251}{66345}I'm thinking probable cause.
{66608}{66672}Get the girls!
{66678}{66721}Okay, asshole!
{66727}{66769}Move! Come on! Get out!
{66775}{66843}Fast! Move!
{66849}{66919}Get your hands on that tree|and face each other!
{66925}{66961}Hands in front of you!
{66967}{67063}- My leg...|- Don't move it, or I'll break your arm.
{67069}{67127}Got them!
{67168}{67208}Show me your hands!
{67214}{67258}Right now!
{67264}{67345}Put your hands out there!
{67426}{67457}See how easy that was?
{67463}{67549}Boom! Still alive.|Now we question him. You know why?
{67555}{67633}Because I didn't shoot him|or jump off a building with him.
{67639}{67673}The building guy lived.
{67679}{67721}The point being, no killing.
{67727}{67776}- No killing, right.|- Right.
{67782}{67831}Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.
{67837}{67938}Read him his rights.|I'll stand here being happy.
{67962}{68025}He's got a gun!
{69038}{69138}You ever met anybody you didn't kill?
{69177}{69270}Well, I haven't killed you yet.
{69290}{69332}Don't do me no favors.
{69338}{69412}Don't you worry.
{69662}{69788}The coroner gave the body|a ride downtown.
{69801}{69886}I guess we can get out of here.
{69970}{70066}I'm sorry about that shit|I said out there.
{70077}{70178}You saved my life. Thank you.
{70293}{70365}I bet that hurt to say.
{70389}{70456}You'll never know.
{70469}{70504}Let's get a bite to eat.
{70510}{70579}Get my shoes on.
{70805}{70908}- Mom, Rog is coming.|- Okay, Carrie.
{71090}{71186}Here's my welcoming committee!|Where's my daughter? Which one...?
{71192}{71288}- Come on, Daddy.|- This one's my daughter!
{71294}{71359}Home, both of you. Dinnertime.
{71365}{71399}How are you doing?
{71405}{71443}I am doing all right.
{71449}{71495}Is that a crook?
{71501}{71599}No, this is my new partner, Martin.
{71655}{71710}I'm glad you're home|at a sensible hour.
{71716}{71784}Well, I try to be a sensible dad.
{71790}{71843}Come on in, Martin.
{71849}{71905}Yeah, close the door.
{71911}{72043}Hello, Nick. Get your legs|off the arm of the couch.
{72048}{72179}How you doing? Is Mommy|in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.
{72268}{72339}Hello, baby!|I want you to meet...
{72345}{72412}I'd like you to meet|Daddy's new partner.
{72418}{72456}- Martin Riggs.|- How are you?
{72462}{72534}- This is my wife, Trish.|- Pleased to meet you.
{72540}{72591}Martin's going to join us for dinner.
{72597}{72671}- Roast okay with you?|- What's for dinner?
{72677}{72747}We'll see what's for dinner.
{72753}{72827}This is a brown, sticky...
{72833}{72867}It's roast.
{72873}{72930}How about a brown|roast-like substance?
{72936}{73007}- Roger, you're being an asshole.|- I try not to be.
{73013}{73054}- Want a drink?|- What do you got?
{73060}{73124}We have Canadian Mist...
{73130}{73253}- You like Canadian Mist?|- Honey, it's in the back.
{73269}{73351}How come we didn't have fish?|I thought we had fish tonight.
{73357}{73395}Don't worry about the fish.
{73401}{73450}Getting defensive...|Ever go fishing?
{73456}{73564}Not since I was a kid.|I used to go spearfishing.
{73573}{73643}All I caught was a cold.
{73665}{73706}I got that boat out there.
{73712}{73763}Rianne, get the dessert.
{73769}{73845}Rianne! Your mother said|get the dessert.
{73851}{73927}- Get the dessert. Get to it!|- Shut up.
{73933}{74044}Catalina Island. Nothing exciting,|but I catch my allotment.
{74050}{74192}You can catch a few things out there.|I caught my wife out there.
{74192}{74232}Nice fishing out there.
{74238}{74280}Mr. Riggs, care for a tart?
{74286}{74363}Thank you, yes. Call me Martin.
{74370}{74412}Mr. Riggs.
{74418}{74473}Sit down.
{74479}{74581}Rianne, it's not the first time|we've had company.
{74681}{74775}{y:i}My name is Carrie, I'm no fairy|{y:i}My sister's cherry
{74781}{74864}{y:i}She's in love with a guy|{y:i}named Martin...
{74870}{74893}Nicholas!
{74899}{74964}Come on. It was really good!
{74970}{75032}Yeah, Dad! Why don't you try it?
{75038}{75097}It was good.
{75122}{75159}Yeah, there you go.
{75165}{75227}{y:i}I'm gonna find a partner|{y:i}My name is Roger
{75233}{75332}{y:i}And I need to be modger|{y:i}And a secret hodger
{75338}{75373}You need some help.
{75379}{75450}I am awful!
{75753}{75851}Hey, sarge! Thanks for|taking out the garbage.
{75857}{75962}But, honey,|I'm entertaining our guest.
{76012}{76056}What do you think?
{76062}{76128}It's nice. You know|anything about boats?
{76134}{76205}- I know what they cost.|- Can you sail this?
{76211}{76288}What's wrong with you?|It's not a sailboat.
{76294}{76327}That's what I thought.
{76333}{76450}There's no trick. That's the front,|that's the back, water all around.
{76456}{76557}Why you gotta make things|so complicated?
{76617}{76712}I don't. Things get complicated|all by themselves.
{76718}{76773}You mean Amanda Hunsaker's|murder, huh?
{76779}{76847}Did I mention that? I didn't.
{76853}{76938}Didn't have to.|I can read your mind.
{76946}{77007}What's the matter with you?
{77013}{77066}- Why is there a problem?|- There's no problem.
{77072}{77125}You got one dead girl|and one dead guy.
{77131}{77241}The guy kills the girl. We kill him|because he wants us to be dead guys.
{77247}{77315}That's easy for you to say.
{77321}{77366}A sugar daddy is dealing drugs.
{77372}{77456}She said, did or saw something|she wasn't supposed to.
{77462}{77561}He pitches her off the balcony|into the sweet by-and-by.
{77567}{77621}That's why he came at us|with a shotgun today.
{77627}{77727}I'm sorry. It's just a little|too neat. I can't swallow it.
{77733}{77855}Of course it's neat.|What's wrong with neat? I like neat.
{77861}{77955}By neat, you mean simple.
{77981}{78031}- You okay?|- Watch out!
{78037}{78095}What button did you push?
{78101}{78171}Where's my manual?
{78177}{78232}Is this what you're|looking for, captain?
{78238}{78283}You asshole!
{78289}{78395}Didn't mean to interrupt one of those|intellectual conversations...
{78401}{78457}Mark asked me to a club|tomorrow night.
{78463}{78536}- You're grounded. You know that.|- Please, Daddy?
{78542}{78569}Which one is Mark?
{78575}{78639}- The blond one.|- With pits in his face?
{78645}{78677}Those are dimples.
{78683}{78787}Pits. When he smiles, I can see|through his head. The answer is no.
{78793}{78821}Have a heart, Rog.
{78827}{78911}Hey, buddy. She smoked pot|in the house. She's grounded.
{78917}{79006}Why can I have a beer|and I can't smoke a joint?
{79012}{79042}It's not coke, you know.
{79048}{79143}I'll tell you why.|Because now, at this moment...
{79149}{79229}...beer is legal, grass ain't.|Right or wrong?
{79235}{79258}It's wrong.
{79264}{79321}Right.
{79431}{79533}They sit there drinking six-packs|and I get grounded.
{79536}{79587}I'm gonna go home.
{79593}{79650}Did we resolve anything here tonight?
{79656}{79724}Yeah, we resolved plenty.
{79730}{79790}We know your wife|takes out the garbage...
{79796}{79887}...your daughter smokes grass|and it's illegal...
{79893}{79998}...and you don't know|a lot about boats.
{80066}{80124}You got a hell of a nice family there.
{80130}{80170}Thank you.
{80176}{80224}I enjoyed the meal. Thanks a lot.
{80230}{80346}Bullshit. But thanks anyway.
{80460}{80532}You don't trust me at all, do you?
{80538}{80652}I tell you what. You make it through|tomorrow without killing anybody...
{80658}{80790}...especially me or yourself,|then I'll start trusting you.
{80808}{80878}Fair enough.
{80964}{81009}I do it real good, you know.
{81015}{81073}Do what?
{81116}{81222}When I was 19, I did a guy|in Laos from 1000 yards out.
{81228}{81318}A rifle shot in high wind.
{81340}{81383}Maybe eight...
{81389}{81502}...or even 10 guys in the world|could have made that shot.
{81574}{81673}It's the only thing I was ever good at.
{81698}{81762}See you tomorrow.
{81771}{81848}Yeah, see you.
{81977}{82063}You really like my wife's cooking?
{82184}{82230}No.
{82236}{82303}See you tomorrow.
{83368}{83422}- You looking for something?|- Aren't we all?
{83428}{83553}You affiliated with any|law enforcement organization?
{83677}{83716}How old are you?
{83722}{83771}- Twenty-two.|- Bullshit.
{83777}{83841}- Why? You like them younger?|- Yeah.
{83847}{83923}Sixteen.
{84001}{84067}A hundred bucks?|What'd you have in mind?
{84073}{84167}I want you to come home|and watch television with me.
{84173}{84289}- That's all?|- Yeah, "Three Stooges" are coming on.
{84295}{84418}- Are you serious?|- Sure, I'm serious.
{84793}{84878}Get out of there, Burbank.
{85312}{85395}This is cute.
{85449}{85550}What have we got here?|"Police evidence".
{87862}{87932}Morning, Roger.|Here, have some coffee.
{87938}{88055}I've been doing a lot of thinking|about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.
{88061}{88105}- How did you get in?|- Trish let me in.
{88111}{88163}- What time is it?|- Daytime.
{88169}{88239}The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she...
{88245}{88316}What was the name of that hooker|who witnessed the jump?
{88322}{88407}Come on, we got to get up|and catch bad guys today.
{88413}{88450}I'll get a shower.
{88456}{88521}What was the name of that hooker?
{88527}{88607}- Century City isn't her usual turf.|- Her name is Dixie!
{88613}{88726}Give me that cup.|And get out of here!
{88810}{88884}Someone was in bed with Amanda|the night she died.
{88890}{88944}Until now, we assumed it was a man.
{88950}{88990}Suppose it was Dixie.
{88996}{89096}Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie|put the drain cleaner in her pills.
{89102}{89137}Say someone paid her.
{89143}{89265}She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple|downers and she's dead." Then Dixie...
{89271}{89295}If it was her.
{89301}{89423}If it was her. She's got time|to spritz the place up and get out.
{89429}{89480}But Amanda jumps out the window.
{89486}{89530}Or Dixie pushes her.
{89536}{89606}She has to make a quick exit|because the body's public.
{89612}{89648}So she hauls ass downstairs.
{89654}{89702}People are saying, "What happened?"
{89708}{89768}Somebody spots her,|and she says, "Shit!"
{89774}{89825}That's right, she says, "Shit!"
{89831}{89940}The point being that now|she has to cover her ass.
{89950}{90088}So she grabs a flatfoot and says,|"Officer, I saw the whole thing."
{90094}{90163}Right.
{90218}{90256}That's pretty fucking thin.
{90262}{90294}That's very thin.
{90300}{90340}Thin's my middle name.
{90346}{90432}Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.
{90438}{90478}- What?|- Nothing.
{90484}{90570}Those remarks won't get you|invited to Christmas dinner.
{90576}{90678}My luck's changing|for the better every day.
{90694}{90791}All right, baby, come to Roger.
{90810}{90883}Center mass.
{90994}{91076}Read them and weep.
{91118}{91177}Do you sleep with that thing?
{91183}{91222}I would if I slept.
{91228}{91320}Step back. Let me show|what an old man can do.
{91326}{91416}Just warming up,|just warming up.
{91562}{91637}Watch carefully.
{91926}{92016}Hey! Look at that, will you?|Not bad for an old man.
{92022}{92111}Step aside, old man.
{93421}{93501}Have a nice day.
{93601}{93672}Shit!
{93721}{93795}Uh-oh! The policemen are here!
{93801}{93918}Yeah, you're right.|Hello, policemen!
{94005}{94054}- How you doing?|- Fine.
{94060}{94124}Are you going to bust Dixie?
{94130}{94196}We're just going over there|for a cup of coffee.
{94202}{94254}We're going over here|to have breakfast.
{94260}{94313}You're gonna bust Dixie!
{94319}{94416}You're gonna bust Dixie!
{94508}{94621}- Like I said, thin.|- Probably nothing.
{94895}{94990}Did you see that? Wasn't that great?
{95041}{95076}What are you, a fag?
{95082}{95160}Your coat's on fire!
{95228}{95345}- Probably nothing.|- Thin. Very thin.
{95361}{95428}You guys okay? Got all|your fingers and toes?
{95434}{95486}Three-William-56.
{95492}{95563}We got a fire and explosion|at 111 th and Larch.
{95569}{95643}Request ambulance and fire department.
{95649}{95707}Do it again! Do it again!
{95713}{95783}- Give me a break, guys.|- Enough, enough!
{95789}{95880}Do you think Dixie was home?
{96108}{96164}What you got?
{96170}{96204}Part of the device.
{96210}{96268}This is artwork.|This is goddamn artwork.
{96274}{96426}This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen|anything like this since the war.
{96432}{96513}The CIA used to hire mercs.|They used the exact same setup.
{96519}{96626}Mercury switches, gaflooey!|That's heavy shit.
{96627}{96735}We got something.|The detective wants to see you.
{96942}{96968}Okay, here it is.
{96974}{97015}Some kids playing this morning...
{97021}{97072}...one saw a guy checking the meter.
{97078}{97129}- Where?|- Here at Dixie's.
{97135}{97239}He was playing under the porch.|Says he saw the guy pretty good.
{97245}{97327}- It could be a break.|- Those kids are 6 years old.
{97333}{97395}- You call the gas company?|- Sure did.
{97401}{97515}No one's supposed to check|that meter for at least a month.
{97521}{97593}- Let me handle this.|- Be my guest.
{97599}{97676}He's the little fellow|that saw the guy.
{97682}{97753}My name is Detective Murtaugh.|What's yours?
{97759}{97839}- Don't tell him your name.|- He'll put you in jail.
{97845}{97876}You won't see your mom.
{97882}{97973}It's all right. I won't|put you in jail. What's your name?
{97979}{98059}- Don't tell him, Alfred.|- Alfred!
{98065}{98145}This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.|This is Alfred.
{98151}{98217}Alfred, hi! How old are you?
{98223}{98254}Six.
{98260}{98346}Six years old. I bet you like Go-Bots.
{98352}{98391}Is that a real gun?
{98397}{98449}Yeah, this is a real gun.
{98455}{98484}Do you kill people?
{98490}{98593}No. If some guy is hurting someone,|I try to shoot him in the leg...
{98599}{98631}...just to stop him.
{98637}{98698}Mama says policemen|shoot black people.
{98704}{98749}- Is it true?|- Yeah, is it true?
{98755}{98835}Is that true?
{98861}{98919}Maybe we ought to get|the kids some...
{98925}{98958}Ice cream.
{98964}{99026}You like ice cream?
{99145}{99245}No, not you, Alfred.
{99309}{99389}The man you saw,|did you get a good look at him?
{99395}{99460}- I saw him.|- Great!
{99466}{99576}Picture him in your head.|Close your eyes.
{99582}{99638}Think what he looks like.
{99644}{99676}Got it?
{99682}{99747}Can you draw him?
{99753}{99830}Give me some drawing paper|and crayons.
{99836}{99891}- This is good.|- Can it, man.
{99897}{99956}We're gonna put out|an APB on Big Bird.
{99962}{100032}"All units. Large|yellow bird, silly voice."
{100038}{100105}You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.
{100111}{100176}Tell me what he looks like.
{100182}{100231}Was he black?
{100237}{100299}Was he white?
{100334}{100381}Was he tall?
{100387}{100423}Tall like me?
{100429}{100503}What color was his hair? Brown?
{100509}{100551}Black?
{100557}{100591}Blond?
{100597}{100654}His hair was blond.
{100660}{100741}What did he have on?|Did he have jeans on?
{100747}{100777}It was paint.
{100783}{100823}Pained?
{100829}{100890}I don't know.
{100916}{100962}Painted?
{100968}{101050}Painted. A tattoo?
{101052}{101151}Like Popeye?|A tattoo like Popeye? No?
{101157}{101222}It was that.
{101245}{101290}Like that?
{101296}{101369}Exactly like that?
{101372}{101426}I saw it good. This is it.
{101432}{101470}I remember.
{101476}{101514}Are you sure?
{101520}{101588}It had a knife, even.
{101828}{101914}Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.
{101920}{101985}Really?
{101989}{102109}A Special Forces tattoo,|mercury switches...
{102168}{102267}What the hell|have we gotten into here?
{102300}{102417}Wonder if there's an opening|in the fire department.
{102625}{102659}Want to tell me about it?
{102665}{102722}- About what?|- Don't bullshit me.
{102728}{102810}Your daughter wasn't killed|for something she was into.
{102816}{102906}She was killed|for something you're into.
{102911}{102966}Stop me if I'm wrong.
{102972}{103043}I don't know what you mean.
{103049}{103129}Keep your hands|away from your pocket, okay?
{103135}{103154}Easy, man.
{103160}{103217}Fuck easy.
{103253}{103346}You called me the other day|to blow the whistle, right?
{103352}{103389}Blow the whistle on what?
{103395}{103474}You were going to tell all,|so they killed your daughter.
{103480}{103546}Tell me if I'm wrong.|Talk to me!
{103552}{103605}They killed your daughter.
{103611}{103685}They paid off a hooker to poison|your little girl.
{103691}{103740}Chrissake!|I've got another daughter.
{103746}{103831}- She'll be protected.|- You don't know these people.
{103837}{103917}Acquaint me with them.
{103965}{104043}It goes back to the war.
{104083}{104222}I worked with a group called|"Air America". CIA front.
{104240}{104314}They secretly ran|the entire war out of Laos.
{104320}{104422}I was with a special unit called|"Shadow Company". Trained killers.
{104428}{104512}When Charlie brought in heroin|to finance the VC government...
{104518}{104590}...Shadow Company burned|the whole thing down.
{104596}{104677}We killed everybody.
{104761}{104807}We also formed a plan.
{104813}{104877}Keep talking.
{104989}{105074}A few years ago, Shadow Company|got together again.
{105080}{105138}The war was over.
{105144}{105231}But we still had our sources in Asia.
{105237}{105289}We've been bringing it in|ever since.
{105295}{105346}Bringing in what?
{105352}{105390}Heroin.
{105396}{105487}Two major shipments a year.
{105532}{105602}It's all run by ex-CIA.
{105608}{105670}Soldiers, mercs.
{105676}{105725}You son of a bitch!
{105731}{105824}If you had cold feet, why did|they kill Amanda? Why not you?
{105830}{105888}- They can't. They need me.|- Why?
{105894}{106052}My company is a perfect front. Makes|everything look great on tax reports.
{106104}{106197}This is big business, Roger.
{106276}{106334}Not anymore.
{106340}{106387}I'm gonna burn it down.
{106393}{106445}You can't. It's too big.
{106451}{106529}These people are trained,|expert killers.
{106535}{106633}Tell me about your next shipment:|Where it's coming in, how many...
{106639}{106714}I can't tell you that, Roger.|I can't.
{106720}{106868}I have another daughter. You can't|protect her. I'm in this too deep.
{107293}{107417}Heroin.|You got off easy, you son of a bitch!
{107876}{107907}You through?
{107913}{107962}I haven't even started.
{107968}{108083}{y:i}Gen. McAllister, this is Delta One.|{y:i}We're coming in. Over.
{108089}{108147}- So your mission is accomplished?|{y:i}- Yes, sir.
{108153}{108206}{y:i}Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.
{108212}{108281}{y:i}I'm afraid, however,|{y:i}that another problem exists.
{108287}{108325}{y:i}What is it? Explain.
{108331}{108380}{y:i}Hunsaker spoke to the police.
{108386}{108465}{y:i}- Are they dead?|{y:i}- No, I missed the opportunity.
{108471}{108563}{y:i}Very disappointing. So the police|{y:i}may know the whole operation?
{108569}{108618}{y:i}That is correct, sir.
{108624}{108681}Joshua, it's time|we turned up the heat.
{108687}{108758}Come on home.
{109160}{109229}What's a nice Irish girl|like you doing out here?
{109235}{109308}I'm looking for a guy,|had this girl in his stable.
{109314}{109389}- Never seen her.|- She's in your line of work. You sure?
{109395}{109454}- Sure. Why?|- I'm a police officer.
{109460}{109561}Don't worry, I won't drag your|ass to jail...
{110184}{110237}You wore your vest!
{110243}{110336}That was smart, kid. Come on.
{110352}{110445}Hold on! I'm on your side.
{110472}{110540}Son of a bitch, that hurts!
{110546}{110642}I'm pissed, Roger! Now I'm pissed.
{110649}{110685}Look at your face!
{110691}{110741}Two inches higher,|he'd have hit your head.
{110747}{110808}Two inches lower,|I'd be a falsetto for life.
{110814}{110897}I bet you'd sound nice too.
{110902}{110987}- Where's my gun?|- Here.
{111024}{111079}Oh, shit! Roger!
{111085}{111144}The guy who shot me...
{111150}{111232}The same albino jackrabbit|son of a bitch that did Hunsaker.
{111238}{111262}You sure?
{111268}{111330}I'm sure, man.|I never forget an asshole.
{111336}{111388}I got an idea.
{111394}{111480}We fly first class to Detroit|and lay low for a couple weeks.
{111486}{111542}Come on, be serious.|What do we do?
{111548}{111575}What else?
{111581}{111644}We bury the fuckers.|And you know what else?
{111650}{111762}We do this right, we get famous.|Do shaving ads. Girls. Money.
{111768}{111831}With our luck, we'll do|Forest Lawn commercials.
{111837}{111912}Bullshit! We got the edge.
{111918}{112042}Roger, they think I'm dead.|I'm a corpse.
{112155}{112226}Brilliant.
{112238}{112317}Brilliant shit!
{112351}{112392}{y:i}We got a body for you.
{112398}{112482}He was at Hunsaker's place.|I saw him, he saw me.
{112488}{112538}Get someone else to do it, okay?
{112544}{112649}{y:i}Captain says give it to you.|{y:i}About two blocks from your house.
{112655}{112746}Yeah, sure. He's probably blond|with big dimples.
{112752}{112845}{y:i}How did you know that, sarge?
{112853}{112905}Get in here!
{112911}{112973}Trouble.
{113016}{113146}They just gave a description|of the kid my daughter's dating.
{113768}{113857}Let's be dark and quiet.
{114811}{114901}The bastards got my daughter.
{115139}{115174}What is it?
{115180}{115199}Nothing.
{115205}{115242}- What is it?!|- Nothing!
{115248}{115351}Get back in your room.|Back in your room!
{115729}{115775}{y:i}You have a beautiful daughter.
{115781}{115901}{y:i}I'd stick by the phone to find out|{y:i}where to meet us.
{116008}{116087}They got my kid.
{116092}{116179}Bastards took my baby.
{116705}{116782}{y:i}Sgt. McCaskey, pick up line three.
{116788}{116829}Homicide, McCaskey speaking.
{116835}{116866}This is KCOP news.
{116872}{116977}We heard an officer was shot tonight.|Can you give us more information?
{116983}{117072}Sgt. Martin Riggs was shot and killed.|Who is this?
{117078}{117162}We'll send somebody right over.
{117233}{117298}Bingo! Riggs is out of the picture.
{117304}{117353}I want Murtaugh taken alive.
{117359}{117418}He may not talk.
{117424}{117507}We have his little girl.|He'll talk.
{117856}{117961}You know they're gonna kill her,|don't you?
{118003}{118111}And if you want her back,|you'll have to take her away from them.
{118117}{118185}I know.
{118278}{118378}We do this my way.|You shoot and you shoot to kill.
{118384}{118490}Get as many as you can.|All you got to do is just not miss.
{118496}{118570}I won't miss.
{118581}{118688}We're going to get bloody on this one.
{118751}{118829}Are you really crazy?
{118858}{118950}Or are you as good|as you say you are?
{118964}{119046}You're gonna have to trust me.
{119105}{119174}Here we go.
{119298}{119399}{y:i}We don't want your daughter.|{y:i}We want to know what Hunsaker told you.
{119405}{119539}{y:i}Dry Lake. Victorville.|{y:i}Sunrise tomorrow. Be there.
{123938}{123979}Murtaugh!
{123985}{124019}Yes, that's right.
{124025}{124074}Show me my daughter!
{124080}{124185}Let me see her,|then I'll come quietly.
{124315}{124354}He wants to see the girl.
{124360}{124427}Get out.
{124522}{124558}Daddy!
{124564}{124626}Okay, baby! I'm here.
{124632}{124678}Okay, it's all right.
{124684}{124726}Simple exchange.
{124732}{124818}You come with us,|the girl takes a walk.
{124824}{124896}Let her go now.
{124913}{124998}As I say, take your hands|out of your pockets.
{125004}{125081}Sure thing, pal.
{125136}{125197}It's alive.
{125220}{125297}Let her go now, or we all die.
{125303}{125331}Take him!
{125337}{125367}He has a grenade!
{125373}{125457}He's bluffing!|He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.
{125463}{125500}If she's gonna die...
{125506}{125625}...she's gonna die with me.|My way, not yours.
{125712}{125817}Come on, Roger, get out of the way.|Move to your left. Come on!
{125823}{125864}Put the pin back in.
{125870}{125964}Officer Murtaugh, don't be foolish.|Look at the hardware.
{125970}{126046}Move to your left.
{126145}{126232}Look at the firepower.|You're grounded. Riggs is gone.
{126238}{126289}Put the pin back in the grenade.
{126295}{126339}If you come closer...
{126345}{126377}...then we all die.
{126383}{126490}No! I don't think so.
{126645}{126725}Come on, honey.
{126738}{126762}Just a smoker.
{126768}{126825}Bingo.
{126921}{126941}Where is he?
{126947}{127004}It's Riggs.
{127025}{127118}Rianne, get in the car!
{127121}{127199}Get in the fucking car!
{127593}{127631}Go, Rianne, go!
{127637}{127732}Come on, cottontail,|stick your head up.
{127738}{127835}That's it, you son of a bitch.|Good night.
{127886}{127988}Don't try it, son.|You're not that fast.
{127999}{128042}{y:i}Hello, Joshua. Hello, Joshua.
{128048}{128103}- Yes, sir.|{y:i}- I got Riggs.
{128109}{128211}He's got Riggs. Go get the girl!
{129023}{129071}Throw your weapon down!
{129077}{129170}Put your hands behind your head!
{129231}{129323}You're Gen. Peter McAllister,|commander of Shadow Company.
{129329}{129392}I see we've heard of each other.
{129398}{129499}Yep. It'll almost be a shame|when I nail you.
{129505}{129610}I ran into some of those Shadow Company|pussies in Saigon in '69.
{129616}{129684}You did, did you?
{130777}{130858}Leave me alone!
{131462}{131521}Save your strength.|You'll need it.
{131527}{131573}Who's the Chin?
{131579}{131662}Endo, meet Mr. Martin Riggs.
{131668}{131738}Endo has forgotten more|about dispensing pain...
{131744}{131811}...than we'll ever know.
{131819}{131860}See, we have a problem.
{131866}{131916}Since we have Murtaugh...
{131922}{131955}...we don't need you.
{131961}{132079}- I believe in being thorough.|- I've heard that about you.
{132095}{132171}Our problem, and yours too...
{132177}{132248}...is we have a shipment|of merchandise to deliver.
{132254}{132336}Why don't you just call it heroin?
{132339}{132413}It's rather large, this shipment.
{132419}{132464}It would be unfortunate...
{132470}{132546}...if we showed up|to deliver our heroin...
{132552}{132593}...and were surrounded by 50 cops.
{132599}{132628}That would be too bad.
{132634}{132688}Yes, it would be.
{132694}{132763}So we have to find out|all the cops know.
{132769}{132877}We don't know shit.|You did Hunsaker before he could say...
{132897}{133019}I wish I could believe you.|Unfortunately, I don't.
{133105}{133174}Now, if you tell me|everything you know...
{133180}{133272}...I promise you I'll kill you quick.
{133287}{133366}I told you everything I know.
{133501}{133575}What is that thing?
{133584}{133634}I'll tell you.
{133640}{133726}It's electric shock treatment.
{133737}{133848}We're in for a long night,|because I don't know shit.
{133867}{133937}We'll see.
{134110}{134169}Hit him again!
{134375}{134432}Again!
{134525}{134599}Tell me about the shipment!
{134620}{134681}I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!
{134687}{134781}Very funny.|What about the shipment?
{134880}{134935}The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh.
{134941}{135011}Go spit!
{135017}{135076}Salt.
{135411}{135517}Go spit, you son of a bitch.|Fuck you!
{135523}{135561}This is getting nowhere.
{135567}{135632}Mr. Large.
{135769}{135800}He knows shit. We're safe.
{135806}{135886}He'd have told us.|Nobody can take that.
{135892}{135923}Fine.
{135929}{136000}Badass soldier, huh?
{136314}{136379}Get her up.
{136465}{136528}Untie me and I'll kill|all of you bastards!
{136534}{136575}Tell me what you know.
{136581}{136683}Fuck you, bastard!|I'll kill you!
{136825}{136905}Sorry, pal.|Say good night.
{137392}{137469}That's a real good-looking|young woman...
{137475}{137569}...you got there, Mr. Murtaugh.
{137602}{137630}I've told you everything.
{137636}{137671}We'll soon know, won't we?
{137677}{137720}I'm warning you.
{137726}{137751}Don't.
{137757}{137816}Spare me, son. It's over.
{137822}{137918}There's no more heroes|left in the world.
{138012}{138079}Kill that son of a bitch!
{138317}{138357}That asshole's getting away!
{138363}{138416}Who's fucking next?
{138422}{138459}McAllister!
{138465}{138530}Who's next?
{138567}{138605}Pretty thin, huh?
{138611}{138683}Anorexic.
{138826}{138880}- Let's do what the shepherd did.|- What?
{138886}{138966}Get the flock out of here.
{139215}{139250}Is it him?
{139256}{139344}No. It's not Joshua.
{141151}{141194}Halt! Stop! Stop!
{141200}{141303}Get out of the fucking car!|Come on, now!
{141334}{141397}Police officers!
{141757}{141912}I'm a police officer. Give me|some backup and take care of the girl.
{142596}{142640}He's going for the freeway!
{142646}{142703}You okay?
{142774}{142907}Cut over the 3rd Street bridge!|You'll get ahead of him.
{142945}{143026}General McAllister...
{143029}{143115}...time for you to die.
{144239}{144304}Hold it!
{144812}{144891}Get back in your car!
{145384}{145472}Mind if I test drive your Audi?
{145522}{145612}Stop the son of a bitch!
{145697}{145756}Shit!
{145770}{145839}He got my car!
{145870}{145957}- Get back!|- Hey, man, I'm cool.
{146187}{146263}Let's get out of here!
{146325}{146386}Open the door!
{146591}{146683}Kill that cop son of a bitch!
{146704}{146799}No way you live. No way.
{148826}{148878}- Gangway!|- Hold it now.
{148884}{148972}- Police officer.|- Go ahead.
{149066}{149142}Well, shit!|What now, kid?
{149148}{149218}First thing, we get you to a hospital.
{149224}{149279}Come on. Let's go.
{149285}{149352}Don't breathe this stuff.|You'll see pink elephants.
{149358}{149405}The slippery son of a bitch got away!
{149411}{149512}- What do you mean he got away?|- Hey, fire me.
{149551}{149581}Where you going?
{149587}{149632}Sarge, I'm commandeering your car.
{149638}{149668}What's the matter?
{149674}{149735}My home!|The bastard knows where I live.
{149741}{149805}I'll drive, Cochise.
{149811}{149912}- I gotta look at him!|- He's all right.
{149956}{150022}3-W-30 en route to|Sgt. Murtaugh's residence.
{150028}{150120}Requesting additional units.
{150893}{150943}Excuse me, sir.|May we help you?

{152358}{152448}Crazy son of a bitch!
{152880}{152956}Give me that. Drop it.
{153152}{153217}Looking for the general?
{153223}{153352}He's barbecuing his nuts|on Hollywood Boulevard.
{153501}{153563}What do you say, Jack?
{153569}{153629}Like a shot at the title?
{153635}{153712}Don't mind if I do.
{154075}{154194}Okay, men! I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.|My responsibility here!

{163579}{163694}- You mind if I bring a friend?|- Of course, bring a friend.
{163859}{163912}I don't think the cat|will like this.
{163918}{164004}I'll put five on the mutt.
{164181}{164271}I'm too old for this.
