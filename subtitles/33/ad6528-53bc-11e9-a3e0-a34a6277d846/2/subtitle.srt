1
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,793
Is it true that there are some
Han Chinese staying at our inn?

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,953
They're all from the Hua Mountain Sect.
I heard they're here to harvest herbs.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,878
While travelling,

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,430
I discovered many scouts from the
Eastern Imperial Secretariat following us.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,470
Maybe it's due to the success of our Sun
Moon Sect's trade in smuggled salt.

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,550
They want a share of the pie,
so that's why they attacked us.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,119
Blue Phoenix!

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,753
Your bad habits are showing again!

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,510
Like a cat thinking of fish,
you think of men all the time.

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,672
Right now, the Han Chinese are outside,
wanting to take advantage of us.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,752
If you don't behave, I'll punish you
severely according to our rules.

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,512
I, Blue Phoenix, understand.

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,554
I wonder where Skinny Boy went?

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,878
Hey, Skinny Boy!

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,191
What do you think you're doing?

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,069
Brother, I like you.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,591
Little Brother, I haven't seen you before.
Where are you from?

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,230
What's going on?
You're a woman!

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,592
Who asked you to enter?
Leave now!

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,432
Did you understand what I said?
Leave!

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,432
You're Han Chinese!

22
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,438
A snake!

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,909
Get out!

24
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,830
- Elder Brother?
- Elder Brother?

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,232
Hua Mountain Sect is a renowned
sect in the martial arts world.

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,150
We have 333 rules.

27
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,192
We adhere to them strictly.

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,672
If anyone breaches a rule,
then I won't let him get away with it!

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,551
You're a student of the Hua Mountain
Sect. You have to beware of your sifu.

30
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,233
He's not as righteous as he seems.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,592
Blue Phoenix.

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,751
I told you
not to mingle with men outside,

33
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,871
yet you've lost us face
to the Han Chinese.

34
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,990
If you don't change,
I'll lock you up.

35
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,551
But he was a woman.

36
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,036
Chief!

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,959
Our men have discovered
the scouts have surrounded our inn.

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,509
It appears that they've come for us.

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,751
Tell everyone
to be prepared and alert.

40
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,599
Steal all the weapons
from the Han Chinese.

41
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,190
Drug their wine.

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,914
When they've passed out,
tie them up.

43
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,552
If the scouts dare to approach,
kill them.

44
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,318
We understand.

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,159
This is a chance for you
to redeem yourself.

46
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,038
I understand.

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,878
Your punishment is to return to
Hua Mountain for three years.

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,429
Yes.
I understand.

49
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,750
A symbol of our sacred Sect?

50
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,000
- Get out.
- Yes, sifu.

51
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,790
Did Uncle Lam say anything
before he passed away?

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,877
Yes. He asked me to do
something very important.

53
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,314
What was it?
Sit down.

54
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,152
Tell me
the details of what happened.

55
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,471
Sifu, Hua Mountain teachers
and students aren't equals.

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,598
Then stand and tell me.

57
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,393
You can tell me now.

58
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,276
I still can't tell you.

59
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,032
Why not? Not telling your sifu is disloyalty,
a serious violation of the rules.

60
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,949
I know, but I swore to Mr. Lam on my life
that I would only tell his son, Lam Ping Ji.

61
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,310
If I violate an oath,
I would be breaking rule 58.

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,592
I would be lying to the heavens,
and would have to unlearn my martial arts.

63
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,312
Rule 58?

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,270
You're right, but if this message is critical
to Hua Mountain Sect's existence,

65
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,072
then we must make an exception.

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,152
That won't work either.
I'll be in violation of rule 79.

67
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,750
If I break my promise to save myself,
I'll be excommunicated by the Sect.

68
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,914
But rule 26 states that if one repents and
is willing to change, forgiveness is granted.

69
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,839
A gentleman may be forced
to be acquiescent to the situation.

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,152
Then, if one repents and is willing to
change, forgiveness is still granted. You...

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,874
That's even more serious.
I would be lying to my sifu.

72
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,598
It violates rule 83.

73
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,469
Deceiving a teacher means
condemnation and heavenly annihilation.

74
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,358
Good! Good!

75
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,351
You are indeed a top student.

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,432
I tested you on purpose to see
if you did adhere to our rules.

77
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,200
Had you told me, you'd have
violated his trust and your faith.

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,271
Sifu would have been
the first to destroy you.

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,200
That was a close call.

80
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,475
Your test is over.
You can go to see Lam Ping Ji now.

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,998
Where am I supposed to find him?

82
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,070
He's just next door.

83
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,269
The next room?

84
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,392
- Quickly tell him the secret.
- So much for a long journey.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,390
The Elder Kuk's qin.
Why does he have it?

86
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,230
Blue Phoenix. You need to first deduce
if this person is a friend or foe.

87
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,198
- Put the qin back where it was.
- I understand.

88
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,918
Don't alert him.

89
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,833
Tell the kitchen not to use
the 7-day sleeping draught yet.

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,151
When we know the whereabouts of
the Elder Kuk, we'll make a decision then.

91
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,116
We understand.

92
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,150
You're...

93
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,758
I'm Lam Ping Ji.

94
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,078
- And you are...?
- Ling Wu Chung.

95
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,190
The walls have ears.
Come here a moment.

96
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,319
Before he died, your father
told me to tell you a secret.

97
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,831
He said there's a Lam family treasure
hidden under your family's waterwheel.

98
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,193
Brother Ling Wu, allow me
to bow to you in thanks.

99
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,839
Don't mention it.

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,992
Brother Ling Wu, I know you like
drinking wine. Wait a moment.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,913
With a Miao wedding taking place,
I'll use this occasion to gift you this wine.

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,317
How did you know
I liked drinking wine?

103
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,351
It smells so good.

104
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,749
Sifu would like you to dine
with him downstairs

105
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,630
when our brother
has finished talking to you.

106
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,512
Okay.

107
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,593
But our brother and sister must remain
in their rooms as punishment.

108
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,469
- I'll deliver dinner to you later.
- Even better! I can savour this wine alone.

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,950
- Smells great.
- Bullshit.

110
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,833
The moonlight shines
in front of my bed

111
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,952
I raise my head
to look at the moon

112
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,709
I bow my head and
think of home, think of home...

113
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,632
Nephew...

114
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,669
Where are you rushing off to?

115
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,632
In two days, it will be one week
since my father's death.

116
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,070
I want to rush back
to arrange his funeral.

117
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,554
Such filial piety.

118
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,439
But it should be arranged
by an elder like me.

119
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,993
There's an Uncle Lam managing
the funeral arrangements at home.

120
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,152
Uncle?
You have an uncle?

121
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,828
I have to speak with him.
I'll take you home.

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,592
- Sifu.
- Sifu.

123
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,869
I can pass on your message. If! bring him
the message, it will save you a trip.

124
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,471
It's no bother, no bother.
Sit. All of you, sit.

125
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,272
- Take a seat.
- Take a seat.

126
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,352
Uncle Ngok, you don't know my uncle.
And my uncle doesn't know you.

127
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,279
What's so important that you must
discuss with him and not with me?

128
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,318
For example,
wedding arrangements.

129
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,471
I must discuss these with your elder.

130
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Why would I discuss it
with you? Right?

131
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,839
A wedding?

132
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,073
I plan to arrange a marriage between
my daughter Ling San and you.

133
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,910
Uncle, I'm in mourning. It would be
unwise for me to discuss marriage.

134
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,080
Why don't we discuss this
in a year or so?

135
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,472
No, it can't wait.
You can't get out of it that easily.

136
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,470
I'll stand in for your father and take care
of you. I'll help make the right decisions.

137
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,634
You can't object. Be obedient
and do what I say, or I'll get angry!

138
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,990
- Let's dine.
- Dad! I don't want to get married!

139
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,349
- Nonsense!
- I won't...

140
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,080
You cannot speak out!
Without me, you wouldn't exist.

141
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,151
This doesn't concern you.
Upstairs!

142
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,673
This is for your own good!

143
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,150
- Lam Ping Ji eats dog shit!
- Nonsense! See if! don't kill you!

144
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,309
She's so spoiled.

145
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,948
Uncle Ngok, thankfully you're here,
or there would've been a scene.

146
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,270
Without a doubt!
One's guard must not be dropped!

147
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,791
Who is it?

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,752
- Open up, it's me.
- Okay.

149
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,758
There's no need to hide any more.
My sister's here.

150
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,630
If you knew I was there,
why didn't you say something?

151
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,912
If you knew I was sitting on you,
why did you let me?

152
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,913
Leave now!

153
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,876
Hurry! Hurry!

154
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,150
- Don't tell my Chief.
- Okay. Leave!

155
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,348
Look me up when you're free
and I'll sing for you again.

156
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,669
- Coming!
- Brother!

157
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,389
Brother, sifu is planning to arrange for
our sister to marry Lam Ping Ji.

158
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,278
Hurry up
and think of something!

159
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,431
Even a tomboy can get married?!
Who's the unlucky guy?

160
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,279
I don't know him.
If! have to marry, I'd rather marry you.

161
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
I've always treated you as a brother.
I don't see you as a woman.

162
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,514
How can you marry me?

163
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,069
Even though I don't act like a woman,
I can learn.

164
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,673
I can learn to be more feminine.

165
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,071
So what? I've never fantasised
about you in that way.

166
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,191
We've been brothers for so long!
What about loyalty?

167
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,193
Look how fierce you can be! You're lucky
if someone wants to marry you.

168
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,430
Will you two stop arguing!

169
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,393
When dawn breaks,
we have to go to the Lam family's home.

170
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,109
If you don't think of something soon,
then it really will be too late!

171
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,029
You're still drinking? Once you get drunk,
Lam Ping Ji can carry you away!

172
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,478
If we go,
we'll have to wander forever.

173
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,632
Have you considered we'd never
be able to return to Hua Mountain?

174
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,189
Never go back?

175
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,079
Yeah. Make up your mind soon.
Run away or get married.

176
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,878
Don't delay.
Run now, plan later.

177
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,429
By the time you've come to a decision,
it'll be dawn!

178
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,190
You're still drinking?
Hurry up and pack your bags!

179
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,833
Be at the big forest before dawn.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,231
Whoever doesn't turn up
will be a nincompoop!

181
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,869
Why are you not drinking the wine?

182
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,469
I don't know how to appreciate wine.
I'm giving it back to you.

183
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,114
Blue Phoenix.

184
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,679
Who told you to drug him?

185
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,159
I didn't.

186
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,835
Chief, he's not been given a sleeping
draught, but a very strong poison.

187
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,191
And it's spread to all the different
meridian points already.

188
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,670
If we don't do anything to save him
in the next four hours,

189
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,031
he may lose
all his martial arts skills.

190
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,790
Damn! Why did you sit on my head
and play music?

191
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,189
What did you say about a head?

192
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,472
Nothing. I said the poison
has gone to his head.

193
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,830
He's been seriously poisoned.

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,274
- Bring him back round.
- Yes.

195
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,159
Show me later how to play
the qin with your head!

196
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,439
Do you still want to drink
some more?

197
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,989
I can't. I can't drink anymore.

198
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,071
You drunk almost all the wine
available here.

199
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,834
Keep an eye on him.
Don't let him make trouble in his state.

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,513
- Yes, sifu.
- Yes, sifu.

201
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,470
The Han Chinese are leaving.
Detain them!

202
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,991
The Han Chinese!

203
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,152
Wait, Chief! If you kill him,

204
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,511
no-one will be able to tell us what
happened to venerable elder Kuk.

205
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,671
Feed him the poisonous worm so that
he'll tell us about our venerable elder Kuk.

206
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,030
Chief, if we feed him
the poisonous worm,

207
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,312
he may become physically handicapped
for the rest of his life.

208
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,754
You're still asking
for mercy on his behalf?!

209
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,718
I dare not, Chief.

210
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,431
These Han Chinese
are working against us.

211
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,751
Cut him up after you
finish questioning him.

212
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,634
Bury him with our dead brothers.

213
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,311
The blue seas laugh

214
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,792
Surging against both shores

215
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,430
We are carried by the waves

216
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,911
We are only concerned with
the here and now

217
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,390
The azure skies laugh

218
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,913
LAUGHING PROUD
WORLD OF MARTIAL ARTS

219
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,071
At the disorder in the world

220
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,670
Only the heavens know

221
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,912
Who will win
and who will lose

222
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,318
The rivers
and mountains laugh

223
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,232
The clouds and rain
are far away

224
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,438
After the billowing waves
are spent

225
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,310
How beautiful the vulgar world
of mortals seems

226
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,160
The clear breezes laugh

227
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,511
And they provoke
feelings of solitude

228
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,229
Noble sentiments
even leave us melancholic

229
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,432
Like a long stretch
of moonlit nights

230
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,548
The green earth laughs

231
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,831
Solitude is no more

232
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,151
Noble sentiments
still make us laugh like we don't care

233
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,518
Mr. Kuk!

234
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,349
Chief!

235
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,030
This man turned out to be
a good friend of our venerable elder Kuk.

236
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,948
Give him the antidote!

237
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,231
If we don't first balance
his inner constitution,

238
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,433
and give him the antidote now,
he won't be able to handle it, and will die.

239
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,429
Quickly render him conscious,
or else I'll kill you all!

240
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,913
One minute she says kill him,
the next save him.

241
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,911
Pay close attention
to Chief's orders.

242
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,513
Otherwise,
if you can't save him,

243
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,470
she'll blame you
for the rest of your life.

244
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,272
The Sect's rules
will be relaxed from now on.

245
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,911
The brave heroes from the Five Mountain
Ranges are indestructible!

246
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,238
Those from the Five Mountain Ranges
are condemned by heaven and earth!

247
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,793
Keep your inner chi steady.
Listen to my calming music.

248
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,668
Chief! Your playing
is less steady than his inner chi.

249
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,153
You talk about being indestructible,
but you're dead afterjust one move.

250
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,117
One arm
in exchange for your life!

251
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,430
Evil... cult!

252
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,551
"Venomous snake rattles his tail."

253
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,551
You have an iron claw!

254
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,349
You have similar weaponry.

255
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,629
We must force out the poisonous worm.

256
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,271
You witch, you're shameless!

257
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,832
Imperial dog!
You're in my way!

258
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,557
- Leave Ling Wu Chung here!
- Leave this place!

259
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,991
- Still trying to escape?!
- Get lost!

260
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,153
- Take this blow!
- Get down!

261
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,832
Now it's my turn to play! Come on!

262
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,828
You still dare to laugh?!

263
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,714
"Cold ice that takes lives!"

264
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,631
Poisonous bees?!

265
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,032
You witch! You cultists!
Call off the poisonous bees!

266
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,711
I, Jo Lang Sim,
will definitely kill all Miao people!

267
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,790
Jo Lang Sim, on behalf of our venerable
Elder Kuk, I'm sending you to hell!

268
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,710
Your Eminence.
Official Au Yeung has arrived,

269
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,831
accompanied by
the Hua Mountain people.

270
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,560
Tell the imperial soldiers
outside to hide immediately!

271
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,029
Have all imperial guards
change into servants' clothing.

272
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,996
- Yes!
- Hurry up!

273
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,269
- Cheung Biu! Li Yee!
- Present!

274
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,110
Find me civilian clothes!

275
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,799
- Yes!
- Hurry!

276
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,029
- Uncle!
- Uncle?!

277
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,912
It's been four or five years!

278
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,318
I appreciate you coming
to arrange the funeral of my father.

279
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,232
Ngok Bat Kwan
from Hua Mountain Sect,

280
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,231
insisted on coming with me
to meet you.

281
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,472
He says he has urgent matters
to discuss with you, sir.

282
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,789
Why haven't you set up
a mourning hall? How strange!

283
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,869
We of the Lam family want
to keep a low profile.

284
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,271
We're afraid that if our enemies find out,
they'll come to exterminate us.

285
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,833
That's why we haven't set up a mourning
hall, but we mourn in our hearts.

286
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,439
Then you're really under duress.

287
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,070
Let us all pray to
Brother Jan Nam in heaven.

288
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,839
We'll all knee! and swear an oath.

289
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,710
To the heavens above.

290
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,877
To the heavens above.

291
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,589
We swear to revenge the Lam family's
loss by shedding their enemies' blood.

292
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,549
We swear to revenge the Lam family's
loss by shedding their enemies' blood.

293
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,231
We must tear their enemies to pieces,
so their corpses remain unburied.

294
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,433
We must tear their enemies to pieces,
so their corpses remain unburied.

295
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,830
Brother Jan Nam,
you who art in heaven,

296
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,429
bless us so that we may find
your murderers and revenge you.

297
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,989
Bow to the heavens three times.
First bow.

298
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,111
Another bow.

299
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,791
Third bow.

300
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,952
We will bow three times in the direction of
Brother Jan Nam's bedchamber.

301
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,759
First bow.

302
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,272
Another bow.

303
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,591
Third bow.

304
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,792
Doesn't Lam family tradition include
bowing to the guests in gratitude?

305
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,114
Family... bow to them in thanks.

306
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,668
First bow.

307
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,471
Another bow.

308
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,551
Third bow.

309
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,910
Your Eminence!

310
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,712
What games are you up to?

311
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,712
This wily old fox wants to arrange
a marriage between his daughter and I.

312
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,313
Even I ran out of ideas!

313
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,948
Then what about Ling Wu Chung?

314
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,830
I eliminated him with a poisoned wine.

315
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,959
What about the whereabouts of
the Prized Sunflower Volume?

316
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,120
I still haven't found out where it is.

317
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,949
The treasure
is under the water wheel.

318
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,430
Damned thief!
Where do you think you're going?

319
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,190
Take this blow!

320
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,430
There's a thief! There's a thief!

321
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,269
Still trying to get away?!

322
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,429
Take this!

323
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,513
Don't try to escape!

324
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,479
The sword energy?

325
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,479
Are you from the Hua Mountain Sect?

326
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,431
"Lower-the-sword manoeuvre."

327
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,950
PRIZED SUNFLOWER
VOLUME

328
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,839
What kind of manoeuvre is that?

329
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,399
Sifu?

330
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,588
Ling Wu Chung,

331
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,911
Hua Mountain Sect's survival
depends on this. You have not seen me.

332
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,151
Where did it go?

333
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,751
PRIZED SUNFLOWER
VOLUME

334
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,474
- Thief? Where's the thief?
- Where's the thief? Where's the thief?

335
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,551
Elder Brother!

336
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,190
Careful! There are many
imperial soldiers outside.

337
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,038
Some may be impersonating
Lam family members.

338
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,952
Everyone, be on alert!

339
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,348
- Who is it?
- Sifu, it's Luk Dai Yau.

340
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,592
- There's something going on downstairs.
- Come in and swear an oath.

341
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,440
Take this scroll
and prepare to leave at once.

342
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,591
This mission
affects the fate of Hua Mountain.

343
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,870
If you have to sacrifice yourself,
do not reveal this secret.

344
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,911
Yes, sifu!

345
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,559
Skinny Boy!

346
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,237
I hope you've been okay.

347
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,993
What are you doing?
What is it?

348
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,072
This is the Prized Sunflower Volume.
Hide it and don't tell anyone.

349
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,593
Why are you mad?

350
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,839
What, you nincompoop!

351
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,989
Nincompoop?

352
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,590
You said whoever didn't show up at
the forest would be a nincompoop!

353
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,509
Didn't he say he'd poisoned
Ling Wu Chung to death?

354
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,879
Arrest him!

355
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,991
Lam Ping Ji! You're mistaken! I'm not
the thief! It was I who called out "thief!"

356
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,590
You'll see the Lam family
treasure is still there.

357
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,991
Stop bullshitting! I know you're
involved with the Sun Moon Sect.

358
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,794
You're the main culprit
who murdered our family!

359
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,429
Didn't you just mention some treasure
of our Lam family?

360
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,319
What do you mean?

361
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,198
- Arrest him!
- Yes!

362
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,551
He's the last descendant of the Lam family.
Why do you want to arrest him?

363
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,920
He's the last descendant
of the Lam family?

364
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,232
There are a lot of people in the Lam family
before him. He'd have to wait his turn.

365
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,072
Do you know where the Lam family
treasure is hidden?

366
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,273
I promised his father I could only tell him.
After doing that, I've forgotten it all.

367
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,277
If you want to know,
ask him yourself.

368
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,954
Uncle, don't let him divide us!

369
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,193
Have mercy!

370
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,591
Uncle, your rules are strict.
We as outsiders don't want to get involved.

371
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,199
Why don't you teach him
a good lesson?

372
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,237
A river doesn't
interfere with a well, right?

373
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,470
Let's help sifu pack
and leave for Hua Mountain.

374
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,437
We take our leave.
Allow me to return this.

375
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,591
- No need to see us off.
- Ling Wu Chung!

376
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,510
Did you yell out
there was a thief?

377
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,908
Yes, uncle.

378
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,150
Then why didn't you grab him?

379
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,914
I wasn't a good enough
martial artist, uncle.

380
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,669
If you, a senior pupil of the Hua Mountain
Sect, weren't a match for him,

381
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,199
who's better at martial arts,
except for your sifu?!

382
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,071
What nonsense!
How dare you! Rubbish!

383
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,752
Why are you all kneeling?
What are you up to?

384
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,109
Inner chi is like bubbling,
flowing water.

385
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,714
Inner peace
is like an immobile mountain.

386
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,757
We sit and meditate
to gather our chi.

387
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,512
So much shouting,
yet Grand Master Ngok,

388
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,309
you're a skilled martial artist,
you should have heard the commotion.

389
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,033
Why were you so late in reacting?

390
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,909
Uncle, why would there be a thief?
Don't listen to Ling Wu Chung's chatter.

391
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,590
He's very fond of lying and deceit,
causing confusion all over the place.

392
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,638
Ling Wu Chung! You've broken
the rules of Hua Mountain Sect.

393
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,712
I'm expelling you immediately!
Leave now!

394
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,756
- Father!
- Sifu! Sifu!

395
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,836
Stop!

396
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,600
No-one here tonight may leave!

397
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,910
Each country has its laws,
each family its rules.

398
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,594
This is a matter for Hua Mountain Sect,
and not the Lam family.

399
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,673
You want to talk about laws of a country?
Fine, then I'll discuss law with you!

400
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,871
- Cheung Biu! Li Yee!
- Present!

401
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,310
Put on your uniforms
and prepare for a formal edict!

402
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,708
- Understood!
- Understood!

403
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,669
Traitor!

404
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,508
The Grand Master of Hua Mountain Sect,
Ngok Bat Kwan!

405
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,750
Knee! to receive an imperial edict!

406
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,078
Ngok Bat Kwan
accepts the imperial edict!

407
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,832
The imperial court needs able men.

408
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,913
I appoint you as my personal security
official, to assist with my activities.

409
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,999
From now on, you will obey my wishes
and carry out my actions.

410
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,032
I, Ngok Bat Kwan, am a country peasant.
I'm afraid I won't be up to the task.

411
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,639
Nonsense!

412
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,270
If you won't accept, it means you're
discontented with the Imperial Court.

413
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,310
That means you want to rebel.

414
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,314
Is your inner chi like
bubbling, flowing water,

415
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,233
or is your inner peace
like an immobile mountain?

416
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,789
I know in my heart
who's loyal and who's not.

417
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,231
Official Ngok,
from now on, you're my man.

418
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,030
If you don't do as I say,
then you're being disloyal.

419
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,752
The punishment is to have
your head chopped off!

420
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,350
We, in the Imperial Court,
have our rules.

421
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,590
You must kowtow to me 1000 times.

422
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,399
Commence to kowtow!

423
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,431
Ngok Bat Kwan!
Commence your 1000 kowtows!

424
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,957
- Kowtow!
- Kowtow! Kowtow!

425
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,918
- Kowtow! Kowtow!
- Kowtow! Kowtow!

426
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,829
One.

427
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,033
Two.

428
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,077
Three.

429
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,071
FouL

430
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,031
Five.

431
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,353
Six.

432
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,356
Seven.

433
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,593
Reporting! We caught a beggar who's
actually a Hua Mountain Sect student.

434
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,871
It's Luk Dai Yau?

435
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,469
Your Eminence.

436
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,910
Official Ngok, let me see
how you handle this matter.

437
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,189
Traitor!

438
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,352
Stealing from the Lam family
means stealing from the Imperial Court.

439
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,239
I'm going to destroy
your ability to do martial arts.

440
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,834
Bring me a sword!

441
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,149
Move!

442
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,119
This book doesn't belong to
the Imperial Court.

443
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,191
It's a music score
given to me by an elder.

444
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,590
It's called The Laughing Proud
World of Martial Arts.

445
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,309
If you don't believe me, I can play it
according to the music score.

446
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,559
If you're interested,
you can sing along with me.

447
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,033
The blue seas laugh

448
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,149
Surging against both shores

449
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,630
We are carried by the waves

450
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,912
We are only concerned
with the here and now

451
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,358
The azure skies laugh

452
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,351
At the disorder in the world

453
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,070
Only the heavens know

454
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,789
Who will win
and who will lose

455
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,399
The rivers and mountains laugh

456
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,870
The clouds and rain are far away

457
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,470
After the billowing waves are spent

458
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,110
- How beautiful the...
- Stop singing!

459
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,759
Ling Wu Chung! Luk Dai Yau!

460
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,434
You're working with the Sun Moon Sect
and have betrayed us.

461
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,556
According to Hua Mountain Sect rules,
your martial arts must be destroyed.

462
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,789
You have to be expelled to appease
our Hua Mountain ancestors!

463
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,230
Execute the rules of our Sect!

464
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,678
My brothers, take action!

465
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,831
Sacrificing myself
for the Hua Mountain Sect,

466
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,831
I, Luk Dai Yau,
will receive glory in death!

467
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,231
Don't sacrifice yourself for nothing!
Sit down!

468
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,673
Is this a mutiny? Do you want me
to destroy all your martial arts?

469
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,751
- "Hua Mountain Sword Trap", en garde!
- Yes!

470
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,272
Elder brother, be careful!

471
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,399
Brother, be careful!

472
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,917
You be careful too!

473
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,952
"Seven swords joining together!"
Is everyone all right?

474
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,118
Kill him!

475
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,718
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

476
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,871
Here we come!

477
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,349
Let's go!

478
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,271
Our sister is down there!

479
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,432
Dai Yau, are you okay?

480
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,238
I'm fine.

481
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,472
Father!

482
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,238
- Sifu!
- Sifu!

483
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,312
Destroy all our martial arts abilities
and let them go!

484
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,471
You make me lose face
in front of outsiders!

485
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,070
There are so many other Hua Mountain
Sect students. I shall destroy all of you!

486
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,989
Father! Please let them go!
I have my brother's stuff!

487
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,631
Grab our sister!

488
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,509
Oops! I lost my hold on her!

489
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,871
You're...

490
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,113
Don't worry. We came to
check on your brother's health.

491
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,029
You dare disobey me! Die!

492
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,671
Die!

493
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,959
You can't die!

494
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,470
Dai Yau, it's dangerous!
Come over here!

495
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,393
Save your lives!
Protect the Hua Mountain!

496
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,276
Hide behind me!

497
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,958
Father!

498
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,799
A two-headed snake!

499
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,837
Ngok Bat Kwan! You hypocrite!

500
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,230
You're just like this snake!
You're double-faced!

501
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,231
You're my official,
yet you work against me?

502
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,712
You mandarins, you're always
considered to be in the right!

503
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,239
Think whatever you like!

504
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,910
Your sifu won't let you go free.

505
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,072
He's already sold out
all your brothers!

506
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,989
If you want to live,
you have to fight your way out!

507
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,548
Brothers, protect our sister,
and leave here first!

508
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,876
Hurry up!

509
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,709
Give up the Prized Sunflower Volume!

510
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,640
I'm such a powerful mandarin!
How do you expect to fight me?

511
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,119
I'm taking the scroll
to see the Emperor!

512
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,913
"Two columns supporting the sky!"

513
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,629
Quickly untie me!

514
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,159
Hurry up!

515
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,230
Untie me!

516
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,714
THE PRIZED SUNFLOWER VOLUME

517
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,870
Who are you people?
Why are you fighting against me?

518
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,630
You don't know?
We are of the Sun Moon Sect!

519
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,272
Skinny Boy! Go up there!

520
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,399
You ignorant youngsters!

521
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,593
You overestimate your own abilities!

522
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,149
If you manage to
get away from me today,

523
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,949
I'll let you write my name,
Gu Gam Fok, backwards!

524
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,678
Fine.
I'll write it backwards for you!

525
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,676
Elder Brother!

526
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,519
Why are you still here?
Get away now!

527
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,873
Old eunuch!

528
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,670
How do you read
your name backwards?

529
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,189
Ifl don't kill you old eunuch, then I'll write
my name, Blue Phoenix, backwards!

530
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,073
The Prized Sunflower Scroll?

531
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,549
It's all right! It's all right!

532
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,589
So much bloodshed, yet the Prized
Sunflower Volume hasn't been sullied.

533
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,751
My position in the Imperial Court
is secure now!

534
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,672
- Don't move!
- Lam Ping Ji!

535
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,990
I'm not Lam Ping Ji!
I'm Au Yeung Chun.

536
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,031
Your Eminence! Kill them all!

537
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,389
Ling Wu Chung,
when you were singing that song,

538
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,318
you laughed at everything
under the sky.

539
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,552
Do you really think that everyone
has a right to laugh?

540
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,320
There are some things which
can't be laughed at.

541
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,472
If you laugh at the wrong thing,
you could lose your head!

542
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,309
So that's why I am eligible
to have the last laugh!

543
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,390
Remember.

544
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,869
Once under my command, if you're
disloyal, there's no second chance.

545
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,119
I will have your head chopped off!

546
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,034
The Prized Sunflower Volume?!

547
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,513
The person most worthy
of being laughed at is himself.

548
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,272
Are we going back
to the Hua Mountain?

549
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,271
Are we still allowed to go back?

550
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,673
We may end up as nomads
like the Miao people.

551
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,070
Elder Brother...

552
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,671
I found your scroll amongst the rubble.
I'm returning it to you now.

553
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,750
The Prized Sunflower Volume!

554
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,191
No, it's "The Laughing Proud
World of Martial Arts," you idiot!

555
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,998
You dare work against me!
Prepare to die!

556
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,589
A student fighting his teacher!
Despicable!

557
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,633
I am no longer part of
the Hua Mountain Sect. I'll fight you!

558
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,033
- I want to ask you a question!
- Keep quiet!

559
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,876
Who's Fung Ching Yeung?

560
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,192
Fung Ching Yeung is my great uncle
within my Hua Mountain Sect.

561
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,833
You shameless youngster,

562
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,673
on what basis do you dare to ask me about
matters concerning Hua Mountain Sect?

563
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,231
On what basis? We're sworn brothers.
That means I'm your step great uncle!

564
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,110
How dare you!
You dare discuss rank with me?

565
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,149
You're wrong to have
betrayed so many people!

566
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,669
Hua Mountain Sect cannot be
sacrificed for you!

567
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,072
You traitor!
I'll kill you as a warning to others!

568
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,110
You don't even have
a third of my sword chi!

569
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,790
If you have the ability to penetrate
10 feet of my sword chi, then fight me!

570
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,990
"Wave-like sword manoeuvre!"

571
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,670
Throw! Throw! Throw! Throw! Throw!

572
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,552
- What kind of swordplay is this?
- "The Nine Solitary Swordplays!"

573
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,556
Father!

574
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,878
Father!

575
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,989
Let him go!

576
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,958
You've already severed
the meridian points on his wrist.

577
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,313
Hua Mountain
doesn't belong to him.

578
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,393
He sacrificed so many innocent lives
to gain power, he's the real traitor.

579
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,878
The blue seas laugh

580
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,672
Surging against both shores

581
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,993
We are carried by the waves

582
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,113
We are only concerned with
the here and now

583
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,550
The azure skies laugh

584
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,871
At the disorder in the world

585
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,669
Only the heavens know

586
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,991
Who will win
and who will lose

587
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,710
The rivers and mountains laugh

588
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,072
The clouds and rain are far away

589
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,790
After the billowing waves are spent

590
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,549
THE LAUGHING PROUD WORLD
OF MARTIAL ARTS

591
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,472
The clear breezes laugh

592
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,800
And they provoke feelings of solitude

593
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:24,637
Noble sentiments leave us melancholic
like a stretch of moonlit nights

594
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,872
The green earth laughs

595
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,478
Solitude is no more

596
00:54:53,080 --> 00:55:00,191
Noble sentiments still make
us laugh like we don't care
