00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,030
MING DYNASTY
DURING WAN LI PERIOD

2
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,353
THE FORBIDDEN PALACE
THE IMPERIAL LIBRARY

3
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,068
THE PRIZED SUNFLOWER VOLUME

4
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,111
THE IMPERIAL LIBRARY

5
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,679
I found it.

6
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,948
The Prized Sunflower Volume?

7
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,953
Leave us!

8
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,033
The Prized Sunflower Volume
is a secret volume of martial arts.

9
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,038
It was written in the third year of the
Hong Wu period. It contains mystical...

10
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,792
Enough!

11
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,990
This is a very serious issue.

12
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,112
The Western Imperial Secretariat
has always worked against us.

13
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,353
If they found out that this has occurred
in an area under ourjurisdiction,

14
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,472
they will definitely go to the emperor
and tell him everything.

15
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,552
If the emperor takes any notice,
it will be the end of us.

16
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,558
There has been so much turmoil
in the Imperial household,

17
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,633
and now with trouble ahead,
I doubt we'll be able to avoid recrimination.

18
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,750
Do you need me
to make preparations...

19
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,993
...to find a scapegoat?

20
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,559
The Forbidden Palace
is extremely well guarded.

21
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,631
An outsider would not be able
to enter and steal things.

22
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,270
Check and see if any Imperial officials
have recently retired or asked for leave.

23
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,316
Be mindful not to involve too many
strangers in this issue.

24
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,151
I understand.

25
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,228
To avoid complications,
we'll only involve our own people.

26
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,951
FUJIAN PROVINCE,
FUZHOU DISTRICT

27
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,199
In the past ten days, two people left the
Imperial Household. One died from illness.

28
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,430
The other is Imperial official
Lam Jan Nam.

29
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,549
His arch rival became his supervisor.
That was his reason for resigning.

30
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,638
He didn't retire then,
but instead waited to retire three days ago.

31
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,233
He's our prime suspect.

32
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,311
This is his ancestral home.

33
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,590
Lam Jan Nam is inside the house.

34
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,109
We've blocked off the surrounding roads.

35
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,589
We've arrested everyone
coming in and out of the house.

36
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,229
Now all that's left to do
is for Your Eminence to seize him.

37
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,593
Sir, as we control this area, why are we
still so cautious, when we can attack?

38
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,432
If we raise the pennant
of the Eastern Imperial Secretariat,

39
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,592
and our retrieval fails, and rumour of it
gets out, how am I to explain it?

40
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,030
We must blame it on someone else.

41
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,113
Lam Jan Nam's family
won't make it through the night.

42
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,951
Why the panic?
What's the problem?

43
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,310
Sir, someone has crossed
our defensive line.

44
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,509
Quickly unblock
their meridian points!

45
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,789
Yes!

46
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,518
We have a martial arts expert.

47
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,672
- What happened?
- Someone's gone into the house.

48
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,030
Everyone, be on your guard.
Someone has crossed the line.

49
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,670
We don't know who it is. Quickly hide
the gunpowder and arm yourselves!

50
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,068
Arm yourselves with swords and knives.
Be alert! Hurry up!

51
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,279
- Be careful!
- Okay!

52
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,593
Sir, didn't you ask
some people to come to help us?

53
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,671
Could it be them?

54
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,548
Soldiers have to be deceitful. We need to
stay calm and see whether it's friend or foe.

55
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,871
Is it Grand Master Ngok?

56
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,754
Are you from Hua Mountain Sect?

57
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,070
I'm Ling Wu Chung of Hua Mountain!

58
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,192
What the...?

59
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,789
I'm under orders to request an audience
with Official Lam Jan Nam.

60
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,389
Shoot!

61
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,149
Shoot!

62
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,472
Hey, hurry up!
We've got their full attention!

63
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,517
How can we be this discourteous?

64
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,113
May I ask who in this crowd
is Official Lam Jan Nam?

65
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,429
I am no longer an Imperial official. There's
no need to extend me that courtesy.

66
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,278
Then why so many
officials and soldiers outside?

67
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,429
Are they your men?

68
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,440
- They are...
- Wait... You're correct.

69
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,149
You have already resigned,
yet you can still mobilise so many troops.

70
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,117
We almost couldn't get in!

71
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,193
We who have been officials
naturally have many enemies.

72
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,071
The Imperial Court values me,
so it sent troops to protect us.

73
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,153
So you two are...

74
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,993
Like I said before,
I'm Ling Wu Chung of Hua Mountain.

75
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,550
- I'm from Hua Mountain...
- Ajunior student. He's like a brother to me.

76
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,792
I blocked two of your men's meridian
points. Let me go and unblock them.

77
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,029
No, don't bother.

78
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,708
They have not studied martial arts
well enough. Let them suffer.

79
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,792
Guards, take them to the kitchen,
and feed them if they're hungry.

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,911
- Yes!
- Yes!

81
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,950
Our sifu sent us to deliver
something to you, Mr. Lam,

82
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,032
but there's also a letter. You have to read
the letter before opening the package.

83
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,838
- Ngan, get it out.
- Okay.

84
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,872
My sifu said I had to hand it directly
to Official Lam, I mean, Mr. Lam.

85
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,151
Bring it over.

86
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,191
Hurry up!

87
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,271
What were you thinking?
Where did you put it?

88
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,948
It's not here?
I think I gave it to you.

89
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,873
- When did you ever give it to me?
- I'm sure I did!

90
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,349
I was afraid to lose it,
so that's why I gave it back to you!

91
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,590
- Where is it?!
- So sorry for keeping you waiting.

92
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,151
Reporting in, your Eminence.
We found a letter on the mountain.

93
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,709
The martial arts expert
must have dropped it.

94
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,429
"My dear friend Jan Nam.

95
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,433
Due to other matters,
my arrival has been delayed,

96
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,397
so I sent a senior student,
Ling Wu Chung,

97
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,870
to deliver a box of sleeping gas,
to aid you against your enemies.

98
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,150
Don't forget that
the box is booby-trapped.

99
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,551
Please do not open it
unless it's absolutely necessary.

100
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,310
Your Eminence,

101
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,192
look at the smoke.
There must be a problem.

102
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,828
If we attack them while they are helpless,
we'll be sure to overcome them.

103
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,913
This is obviously a trap!
They want to trick me with a letter!

104
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,479
We will do nothing!

105
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,108
Your Eminence is right.
We almost fell into a trap.

106
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,751
Put out the fire!
Put out the fire!

107
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,480
Quickly, get lots of water!
Hurry up! Get water!

108
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,358
There's gunpowder here!
Don't use water!

109
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,839
Use cloth to extinguish the smoke!

110
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,671
Ifound it! Ifound it!

111
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,269
This isn't it.

112
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,510
That's a fortune-telling note?

113
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,597
You airhead!
Find the letter!

114
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,352
- Grab those two!
- Yes!

115
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,753
Who are you people?

116
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,672
Forgotten already?
We're from the Hua Mountain Sect.

117
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,556
Yeah.

118
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,829
How do I know you're not fakes?

119
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,399
- What do you mean fakes?
- Wait...

120
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,913
You can test us.

121
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,479
As Mr. Lam is good friends
with my sifu,

122
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,471
he must recognise
Hua Mountain Sect swordplay.

123
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,471
Let me demonstrate,
then you can all pass judgement.

124
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,392
Please step aside,
there isn't enough space.

125
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,951
Up on the tall mountain peaks,

126
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,270
travelling alone on the plains,

127
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,871
the wind blows away
the fallen leaves,

128
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,230
making the bare branches
look even more lonely.

129
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,550
The angry sword
makes the skies tremble.

130
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,830
The thunder echoes
in the softly falling rain.

131
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,510
There is no stronger warrior
in the Shu kingdom.

132
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,511
I turn to attack,

133
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,431
I gaze upwards to the moon,
I gaze downwards and reminisce...

134
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,233
Be careful with the flame!

135
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,269
I got confused!

136
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,829
In my excitement, I added my own moves.
It wasn't Hua Mountain style.

137
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,399
- Let me restart!
- It's enough.

138
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,551
I believe you're
Hua Mountain Sect students.

139
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,233
If it's enough, then I'll stop.

140
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,992
Brother...

141
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,999
Is there something
you have difficulty expressing?

142
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,310
What's important is not whether
we are students from Hua Mountain,

143
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,829
but whether you are really
the venerable Mr. Lam,

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,560
because our sifu has a message
which we have to communicate personally.

145
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,713
All right.
The Lam family's "Iron Palm",

146
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,350
including the move "Razing mountains,
draining seas" is relatively well-known.

147
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,312
I defer to your judgement.

148
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,792
Bravo! "Razing mountains, draining seas"
lives up to its name! Very powerful!

149
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,474
He did it behind his back.
How could you tell that was it?

150
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,710
He's got himself out of breath.

151
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,593
If you don't applaud, and are so tactless,
how are you going to progress in society?

152
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,079
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo! Bravo!

153
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,356
Hurry up! Hurry up!

154
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,630
I've shown myself to be Lam Jam Nam.
What is the message?

155
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,869
He said...

156
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,718
- He said he...
- Come down quickly!

157
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,199
Say it louder. I can't hear you.

158
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,918
Hurry up! Move it! Move it!

159
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,069
Can you be more quiet?

160
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,669
- Everyone, be quiet fora moment!
- Please repeat what you said.

161
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,673
My sifu says he's busy and
he'll come next time. Did you hear that?

162
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,999
- Let's continue what we're doing.
- That's it?

163
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,798
- Yeah.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

164
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,069
Escort the guests upstairs!

165
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,070
Apologies for not taking care of you
properly. Please rest upstairs.

166
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,552
Escort the guests upstairs!

167
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,191
Please.

168
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,590
Don't worry.
We won't come down.

169
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,391
Come and practice singing
together! Hurry up!

170
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,278
I haven't even caught my breath yet.
Must we keep practising?

171
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,113
Practise less? We're surrounded
by four-sided Chu songs.

172
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,598
What's a four-sided Chu song?
How do we sing that?

173
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,274
Sing?! We're surrounded
by enemies inside and outside.

174
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,749
We're pretending to sing to pretend
everything's okay, that's all.

175
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,591
I see.

176
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,313
Actually...

177
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,869
There are two groups of people,
inside and outside.

178
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,071
Once they start fighting,
we need to leave immediately!

179
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,633
Wow, it's so exciting!

180
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,189
It's really been a trip
well worth the effort!

181
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,951
I'm going to stay and watch.

182
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,431
Hey! Continue playing!

183
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,678
You're a good enough
fighter to stay and watch?

184
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,512
Sifu doesn't know
you came with me.

185
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,831
If something happens to you, I'll never be
able to go back to Hua Mountain again.

186
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,513
Then why don't we leave now?

187
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,829
I don't want to get you banished.

188
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,952
I've no idea how many
martial arts experts are outside!

189
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,390
If it's that simple to leave,
everyone would have left already.

190
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,037
We'll wait till it gets dark,
then it'll be easier to leave.

191
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,759
Yes.

192
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,150
Something's wrong. There may be
another martial arts expert coming.

193
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,594
- Protect his Eminence!
- Yes!

194
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,637
Protect his Eminence!

195
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,873
Protect his Eminence!

196
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,951
I, Jo Lang Sim, Five Mountain
Ranges chief, pay my respects.

197
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,310
Be careful!
He's behind the screen!

198
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,231
"Cold Ice That Takes Lives!"

199
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,671
"Driving Great Waves
to Rise Up!"

200
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,751
I, Jo Lang Sim, Chief of the Five Mountain
Ranges, pay my respects to Lord Gu!

201
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,513
Lord Gu!

202
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,433
- Your Eminence!
- Lord Gu!

203
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,631
- Rise, everyone.
- Yes!

204
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,191
Fall back.

205
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,071
I am fully aware of who's loyal to me.

206
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,673
Although you're a practitioner of dark arts,
you've worked hard as my advocate.

207
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,071
I'm just a loyal dog playing fetch. Serving
your Lordship means my future is limitless.

208
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,629
This time your Lordship

209
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,434
wants me to retrieve a book called
The Prized Sunflower Volume.

210
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,319
I've not had much chance to study,
to avoid making a blunder.

211
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,558
May I ask what kind of book
the Prized Sunflower Volume is?

212
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,389
Hey!

213
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,079
It's a hand-written scroll.

214
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,069
It only teaches the art of gardening.

215
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,392
If it's only about gardening,
then it will be an easyjob.

216
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,830
I will do as Your Eminence wishes,
down to the last detail.

217
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,631
You don't have to know what
the Prized Sunflower Volume is.

218
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,432
You have my warrant issued
by the Imperial Court.

219
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,238
Acting according to
my wishes will suffice.

220
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,712
Rest assured, Your Eminence, I will do
my utmost. Should I leave anyone alive?

221
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,114
- Try your best to avoid complications.
- As you wish.

222
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,191
I'll begin at nightfall.

223
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,553
Brother, the water's really cold.

224
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,789
You're not dressed!

225
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,872
Who wears clothes to bathe?
Quickly bring my robes over here.

226
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,672
Still you rely on others!

227
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,751
You should have got
some clean clothes ready.

228
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,831
All this just because I asked you
to get me some clothes?

229
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,679
If you don't, what am I going to wear?
Hurry up, I'm cold.

230
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,398
Please don't.

231
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,950
No. If! help you once, you'll rely on me
every time. Get them yourself.

232
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,717
You even said
we were like brothers!

233
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,791
Who is it?

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,991
- I've come to deliver dinner.
- Coming!

235
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,959
Put on your clothes.

236
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,958
Coming! Coming!

237
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,471
They're trousers!

238
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,033
They're also trousers!

239
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,511
My guests!

240
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,390
Give it to me.

241
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,309
As we're in the countryside,
we go to bed early. Please retire early.

242
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,396
Okay, okay.

243
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,353
As we're renovating downstairs,
you'll have to dine in your quarters.

244
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,192
Renovating?
I thought you were demolishing.

245
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,432
See if the water's cold.
If it is, add some hot water.

246
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,278
Yes.

247
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,149
Don't come here! The water's hot enough.
Do you want me to boil to death?

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,991
Don't come over here!

249
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,070
Leave me alone!

250
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,318
He's boiling with rage! The water's
hot enough. You don't have to add more.

251
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,472
Okay, we won't add any then.
Enjoy your dinner.

252
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,159
Okay, okay.

253
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,038
It's getting dark.
Put your clothes on, quick!

254
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,192
If you're going to be disguised
as a man again, don't bathe, skinny boy!

255
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,510
Wow!
There's so many people here!

256
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,951
Are you all waiting to leave too?

257
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,634
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

258
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,037
Hurry up
and extinguish the light first!

259
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,790
You have the guts to knock,
but not to show your face?!

260
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,430
If you prefer to be a coward,
then stay out and freeze!

261
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,870
The Chief of the Five
Mountain Ranges has arrived!

262
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,274
I am Jo Lang Sim, the Chief of
the Five Mountain Ranges.

263
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,111
Last month
we fed to the crocodiles

264
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,629
a man masquerading
as the leader of the Five Lakes.

265
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,950
The Five Mountain Ranges area
produces many heroes.

266
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,270
On what grounds are you
the leader of the Five Mountain Ranges?

267
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,109
With no obvious grasp of humility,
why don't you just call yourself king?!

268
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,672
Lam Jan Nam, I'm not going to waste time
talking to a useless fool like you.

269
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,189
Quickly surrender the scroll!

270
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,278
If you were well-educated and well-bred,
you wouldn't be seen as a shit-eating dog!

271
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,351
A shit-eating dog
is better than being dead!

272
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,232
Light the gunpowder fuse
when the innkeeper turns around.

273
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,033
Hey, I dropped something.

274
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,599
Pick it up quickly!

275
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,231
Brother, I think I lit
the gunpowder!

276
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,232
Did you hide
a lot of gunpowder here?

277
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,310
- Yes.
- Yes.

278
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,239
- Let's run away quickly!
- Hurry up! Let's go!

279
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,557
The gunpowder will explode!
Let's go quickly!

280
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,950
We can't! There are still people inside.
We have to let them know!

281
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,912
Are we going to make it in time?

282
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,428
Fine. As you're illiterate, you can take
a lucky guess from all my books.

283
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,072
The gunpowder's been lit!
Get away quickly! Get away quickly!

284
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,312
It's been lit?

285
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,669
Let's go!

286
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,836
It's a trap!

287
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,149
He was just supposed to keep the heat
off us, but he's done this instead!

288
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,594
- Extinguish the fire!
- Yes!

289
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,629
- The Hua Mountain style swordplay?
- Skinny boy!

290
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,670
Don't fight one of your own!

291
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,871
Mr. Lam? Your leg!

292
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,309
I'm injured.
We can't stay here long.

293
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,233
Have you seen my wife
and son, Lam Ping Ji?

294
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,278
Lam Jan Nam! I know
you're hiding in the reeds!

295
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,919
Jan Nam!

296
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,236
Jan Nam!

297
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,309
My lady!

298
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,634
Hurry up and show yourself!
Let's make a deal!

299
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,439
Let's see what you have to offer!

300
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,033
If you want a sample of what I have,
I'll show you!

301
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,430
- Jan Nam!
- Don't make a move!

302
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,149
For their safety, we decided
to take separate escape routes,

303
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,351
but it's been
to their detriment instead.

304
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,590
You won't be able to save them.
Let's think of something else.

305
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,910
I'm really at a disadvantage now!

306
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,473
You want to bargain?!

307
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,392
Take action! Break her arms!

308
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,437
Help!

309
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,231
Jo Lang Sim! You're a member
of the martial arts world!

310
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,352
How dare you use such despicable
methods against an unarmed old lady!

311
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,590
I have no mercy for criminals
condemned by the imperial court!

312
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,279
Jan Nam!

313
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,748
Catch!

314
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,032
What is it?

315
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,111
It's... an eyeball.

316
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,029
Jo Lang Sim! Stop immediately!
I'll come out now!

317
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,796
It's almost dawn now.

318
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,719
My men are very good at qing gong.
Very soon you won't be able to hide!

319
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,553
I've been in a sea of danger
my whole life.

320
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,711
Now that I've lost my position
in the imperial court,

321
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,230
I was afraid my descendants
would be under threat from my enemies.

322
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,391
This is why I wanted
a means for self-defence.

323
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,552
I didn't think it would result in
the family break-up and death.

324
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,270
Ling Wu Chung,
if I don't make it out alive today,

325
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,792
then I need to ask you
to fulfil my last wish.

326
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,639
Mr. Lam, I'll do as you wish.

327
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,552
But you have to swear to the heavens
to keep your promise.

328
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,193
I, Ling Wu Chung, swear to the heavens,
if I break my promise,

329
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,079
bolts of lightning will kill me and
my corpse will remain unburied.

330
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,872
Tell my son, Lam Ping Ji, that I hid our
family treasure under the water wheel.

331
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,589
Remember that.

332
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,833
My son's left shoulder has a scar
shaped like a cross

333
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,189
from a martial arts accident.

334
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,189
Lam Jan Nam!

335
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,631
You're heartless like a wolf!
Don't you want your woman anymore?!

336
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,993
You animal!

337
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,310
Why haven't you stopped?!

338
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,109
I've already cut out her tongue. Even if
she wants to scream, she can't anymore!

339
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,512
Fight me to the end!

340
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,393
You have to make the best of the situation,
and leave this place by yourself.

341
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,913
No, I want to be with you!

342
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,149
I have to go save them!

343
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,510
Sifu didn't realise it would be this serious
when he asked me to come.

344
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,749
Find him and tell him.
I'll going!

345
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,029
Brother!

346
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,519
Mr. Lam!

347
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,474
Chief! I think there's a student
of the Hua Mountain Sect behind Lam.

348
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,039
Bow and arrow!

349
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,194
Mr. Lam!

350
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,879
An arrow!

351
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,472
Mr. Lam!

352
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,871
Remember my message...

353
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,750
As long as you're able to tell
my son Lam Ping Ji,

354
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,949
then my death
will be worth something...

355
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,949
Mr. Lam!

356
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,039
Mr. Lam!

357
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,277
Skinny Boy! Let's go!

358
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,830
Your Eminence!

359
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,359
You've done very well.

360
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,149
You've burned all the corpses of the Lam
family, but as so many people have died,

361
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,153
sooner or later,
the local magistrates will be alerted.

362
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,118
Don't worry, Your Eminence.
I've arranged matters with my men.

363
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,271
There's a Sun Moon Sect here,
a Miao minority group.

364
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,034
They specialise
in smuggling salt in this area.

365
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,553
We can blame them.

366
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,951
If the local magistrates pursue this
Han Chinese and Miao minority conflict,

367
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,996
the Miao could rebel.

368
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,189
SUN MOON KILLS LAM FAMILY

369
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,311
Someone will be punished
when news reaches the capital.

370
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,351
They won't be able to take
responsibility for this.

371
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,910
It won't matter.
It'll just be forgotten in the end.

372
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,111
You really know how to react quickly.

373
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,953
You react so quickly. If I'm not careful,
then you might even get ahead of me!

374
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,073
Please forgive me for making decisions
without first consulting you.

375
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,630
Young man, if you take on too much
yourself, you might lose your head!

376
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,239
- Get up.
- Yes, Your Eminence.

377
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,073
WANTED:
SUN MOON SECT CRIMINAL

378
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,872
Uncle, there's so many people
on the pier. Is the boat late?

379
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,198
They're sending someone off.

380
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,671
- Oh...
- The Head of Seun Fung Tong is retiring.

381
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,469
After he leaves, no-one knows
what will happen in the future.

382
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,438
We don't know how long
the new Head will last.

383
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,078
We all grew up
relying on this body of water.

384
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,792
I've been in service 41 years, and although
not everyone is in harmony with each other

385
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,350
there are only minor eddies of dissension
between each other,

386
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,432
and we haven't had to
weather a storm yet.

387
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,870
Hey! I think I've seen these people
in the Lam family home.

388
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,553
- Let's leave quickly!
- Yeah.

389
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,590
Where's the backpack?

390
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,396
Who is it?

391
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,229
- If you want to know, ask him yourself.
- Fine!

392
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,389
Without conflict, there would be no world of
martial arts. There would be no heroes.

393
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,591
I am now relinquishing the burdens.

394
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,109
I'm handing over the management
of Seun Fung Tong to you now.

395
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,350
Venerable Head of the Tong,
don't worry.

396
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,909
In the past few years,
more boats are travelling on this river,

397
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,833
and the imperial court is also
paying close attention to our well-being.

398
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,992
I won't make major changes,
just minor adjustments,

399
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,798
so that we can all lead
peaceful lives.

400
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,474
Iwill not lead us against the tide.

401
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,234
Whatever the tides are like,
it's the people who are most important.

402
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,868
- Leave!
- Get out of the way!

403
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,190
No-one may leave this place!

404
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,111
Our officials are here attending
a ceremony! Do not cause a scene!

405
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,159
I want to search your boat.

406
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,678
I suspect this boat is carrying someone
from the Sun Moon Sect.

407
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,908
Don't worry, uncle. We're not members
of the Sun Moon Sect.

408
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,672
lam.

409
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,993
I have an old friend on the boat.
I don't want him to be disturbed.

410
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,798
These upstarts
aren't from round here.

411
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,191
If we give them some money,
they'll go away.

412
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,951
- Master Chau, I'll take my leave.
- Please take care of yourself.

413
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,710
I'm Ah Sei, the head guard.

414
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,309
If you want to cause a scene,
come with me to the courthouse.

415
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,754
- Come! Come!
- Someone's causing trouble!

416
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,831
Kuk Yeung, you're a member of
the Sun Moon Sect. Don't come out.

417
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,876
Set Sail!

418
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,990
I have a warrant from the imperial court.
Anyone in my way will be seen as a rebel.

419
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,474
Although there's more of you,

420
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,349
to us from the imperial court,
you're just a handful of people.

421
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,434
Don't try to catch the arrow!
He's has a lot of nei Ii!

422
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,908
The dog trying to catch the cat
has instead caught a mouse!

423
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,832
There was a Sun Moon Sect
member on board.

424
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,390
He's Jo Lang Sim,
a practitioner of dark arts.

425
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,913
The Imperial Eastern
Secretariat minion.

426
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,638
He killed the Lam family!

427
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,519
What? Luckily he doesn't know how
to swim. He won't dare to give chase.

428
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,033
What conspiracy is this now?

429
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,431
Unfounded hearsay is the reason why
we haven't met in over 40 years.

430
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,711
Over 40 years have passed.
At least we can both retire today.

431
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,034
This is a problematic district.
We shouldn't come back here anymore.

432
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,871
We haven't seen each other in so long.
Remember the song from our youth?

433
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,993
Hey, we haven't played music
together in a long time.

434
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,713
Young man, we composed this song
together when we were young.

435
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,950
You can sing along with us.

436
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,389
THE PROUD LAUGHING
WORLD OF MARTIAL ARTS

437
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,551
The blue seas laugh

438
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,833
Surging against both shores

439
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,030
We are carried by the waves

440
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,272
We are only concerned with
the here and now

441
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,792
The azure skies laugh

442
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,790
At the disorder in the world

443
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,509
Only the heavens know

444
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,592
Who will win and who will lose

445
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,674
The rivers and mountains laugh

446
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,912
The clouds and rain are far away

447
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,590
After the billowing waves are spent

448
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,110
How beautiful the vulgar
world of mortals seems

449
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,232
The clear breezes laugh

450
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,151
And they provoke feelings of solitude

451
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,279
Noble sentiments leave us melancholic
like a long stretch of moonlit nights

452
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,998
MANUAL FOR PLAYING THE QIN

453
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,952
The green earth laughs

454
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,831
Solitude is no more

455
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,709
Noble sentiments still make us laugh
like we don't care

456
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,272
It's Seun Fung Tong's big boat!

457
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,992
Small boat in front!
Lower your sail!

458
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,229
Hey, lower your sail!

459
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,029
- Turn the rudder!
- Yes!

460
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,792
- Ram the small boat!
- Yes!

461
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,394
Who's on the big boat?
We're also from Suen Fung Tong!

462
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,391
Ignore him! Ram the boat!

463
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,349
Come with me!

464
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,593
Jo Lang Sim, take this!

465
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,150
The way of heaven brings prosperity,
rebellion brings death.

466
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,311
- You're spineless!
- That's how things are!

467
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,350
You traitor!

468
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,357
I'm clearing the way
for the Imperial Court.

469
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,198
Jo Lang Sim!
You son of a bitch!

470
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,191
"Storm Clouds covering the Skies."

471
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,919
- Let's go!
- Into the water!

472
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,829
Take this!

473
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,150
Old friend!

474
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,550
Old Kuk! Old Kuk!
Are you all right?

475
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,952
Old friend, I'm okay.
You be careful!

476
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,551
The boat has a hole!
Quickly, seal it!

477
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,951
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up and seal it! Hurry up!

478
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,910
- Venerable Mr. Kuk, your arm!
- Look after my old friend. I'm managing.

479
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,149
Brother!
They're both badly injured.

480
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,560
I understand. I'm looking
for a place to go ashore.

481
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,791
No need, young man.

482
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,990
Everywhere is the same. Look at how nice
the wide sea and blue skies are...

483
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,190
We don't have much time left.

484
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,191
Old Kuk, we haven't finished singing
"Proud Laughing World of Martial Arts."

485
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,629
Old friend, I'm really useless.
Come over and help me.

486
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,072
After all these years, I've never heard
you call yourself useless.

487
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,679
You're admitting
you're getting old, huh?

488
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,633
The blue seas laugh

489
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,031
Surging against both shores

490
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,998
We are carried by the waves...

491
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,833
We are only concerned
with the here and now

492
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,671
The azure skies laugh

493
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,308
At the disorder in the world

494
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,233
Only the heavens know

495
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,709
Who will win
and who will lose

496
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,677
The rivers
and mountains laugh

497
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,388
The clouds and rain
are far away

498
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,551
After the billowing waves
are spent,

499
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,399
How beautiful the vulgar world
of mortals seems...

500
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,758
Brother!

501
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,149
Venerable Mr. Lau, he's...

502
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,792
- Sir, we've reached the shore.
- Take it slow and easy.

503
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,318
I'm not going back.

504
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,593
I give to you this qin and "The Proud
Laughing World of Martial Arts."

505
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,669
Consider it fate, the fact that we were able
to be together and share a boat ride.

506
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,512
In the future, when you find
an audience for it, pass it on.

507
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,190
I hope that you young people
will be able to achieve

508
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,353
what we, the older generation,
haven't been able to do.

509
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,748
Old friend, I hope that we haven't
given the qin to the wrong people.

510
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,390
We'll use up this barrel of wine.

511
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,914
SUN MOON SECT HAS
DESTROYED THE LAM FAMILY

512
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,158
He's dead.

513
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,993
Have you found
all the weapons yet?

514
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,309
We've found all of them.

515
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,277
- Continue the search.
- Yes.

516
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,031
Official Au Yeung.

517
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,951
Official Au Yeung.

518
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,712
Your Eminence, Lam Ping Ji is dead.

519
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,712
We still don't know the whereabouts of
the Prized Sunflower Volume.

520
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,873
But before he died,

521
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,759
he did reveal that the two who escaped
were Hua Mountain Sect students.

522
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,832
One of them
is called Ling Wu Chung.

523
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,713
From the Hua Mountain Sect?

524
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,999
The Shaolin have fist-fighting,
the Hua Mountain Sect their swordplay.

525
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,790
I fear that a dog like Jo Lang Sim
won't be able to bite them.

526
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,797
I'm not sure what he's up to.

527
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,520
In the beginning, we only used him
to keep the heat off us.

528
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,478
But instead, he's flashing the warrant
we gave him all over the place.

529
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,269
As a precaution,
should we do away with him?

530
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,431
You're a very practical man.

531
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,830
It's not easy to keep
a useful, obedient dog like him.

532
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,953
If you kill him, who will guard our door
and bark at strangers?

533
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,228
As you're so able, why don't you
make the decision for me!

534
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,910
I don't dare.
I know he's like a dog,

535
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,798
but a dog will bite anyone
when cornered.

536
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,473
We've mobilised
so many people this time,

537
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,393
could we be over-exaggerating
and risking not getting the right result?

538
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,108
You are indeed a miscreant!
So many suggestions.

539
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,353
You just want to know what
the Prized Sunflower Volume is.

540
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,469
Thank you, Your Eminence,
for enlightening me.

541
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,709
The Prized Sunflower Volume

542
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,992
is rumoured to be a record of the Sunflower
Modus of Telekinesis and Teleportation.

543
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,513
Martial arts folklore says that

544
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,151
someone who has telekinesis,
can teleport through walls.

545
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,789
He can use his powers from afar.
It's hard to believe.

546
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,993
But I heard that our Emperor
has witnessed it himself.

547
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,671
Ifl had known earlier that
the Forbidden Palace had such a book...

548
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,434
You may not believe it,

549
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,990
but in martial arts, masterful experts
are often surpassed.

550
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,512
Some think that
they can do something very unique.

551
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,240
But they don't realise
there are others who can!

552
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,949
Take this!

553
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,719
Our opponent is a very skilled swordsman.
Be careful, everyone!

554
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,791
There's no need to give chase.

555
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,712
That person has a lot of nei Ii.

556
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,952
He evaded my attack, which means
he's more than a match for any of you.

557
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,039
Lam Jan Nam must want
to use him to deal with us.

558
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,996
Au Yeung Chun!

559
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,431
Take a few men. Try to blend in with the
Hua Mountain Sect crowd on the way!

560
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,591
Capture Ling Wu Chung
and bring him back to me!

561
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,230
Yes, Your Eminence.

562
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,390
Skinny Boy, are you all right?

563
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,874
- Brother...
- How are you feeling?

564
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,909
Brother...
I want to return to Hua Mountain.

565
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,349
The world of martial arts
is too scary...

566
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,670
Don't talk so much. You've got a fever.
Rest a bit, then we'll talk later.

567
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,871
If sifu hasn't arrived
at the Lam family home,

568
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,712
he must still be harvesting herbs.

569
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,598
We'll find him and
return to Hua Mountain together.

570
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,239
Don't dwell on things too much, okay!

571
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,072
Press down on
your Hegu meridian point.

572
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,879
- Yes, like that. Good girl.
- I want to go back to Hua Mountain.

573
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,268
Someone's coming!

574
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,553
Who's there?

575
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,871
Old uncle, it's very dangerous here!
Don't be around us!

576
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,519
Get away quickly!

577
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,240
I'm already running away.
Now you're asking me to leave.

578
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,039
I'm so old,
where do you expect me to go?

579
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,630
Old uncle, what are you doing here?

580
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,152
I'm cooking.
May I fill my stomach before I leave?

581
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,193
Look at your friend. He must have
got sick from a lack of food.

582
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,033
Don't panic. The world is a big place.
There must be somewhere you can go.

583
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,078
By starting a fire here, the smoke
could easily alarm the animals outside.

584
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,116
I have dry rations with me.

585
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,550
You put out the fire,
and I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

586
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,909
That's settled then!

587
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,672
Be my guest.

588
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,831
You're still very warm!

589
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,269
I don't even know if I'm biting into
your bun, or if your bun is biting into me!

590
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,352
It's tougher than my old bones!

591
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,873
What's wrong?

592
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,949
Old uncle,
we have to get away from some people.

593
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,198
Once you get out in the open,
go west.

594
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,238
When the sun has risen behind your back,
then you can return.

595
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,870
As long as you're not with us,
you'll be all right.

596
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,269
I still have some dry rations.

597
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,717
Skinny boy, I'm going to go out
and divert them.

598
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,713
Make your getaway east, that way,
so you don't run into the old uncle.

599
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,950
I'll be able
to find you again, okay!

600
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,550
- Brother! Be careful!
- I'll be fine.

601
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,798
Old uncle,
you were meant to go west!

602
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,269
It's pitch black.
I can't tell which way's which.

603
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,880
I don't know him! I'm Ling Wu Chung
of the Hua Mountain Sect!

604
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,758
If you need something,
just ask me!

605
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,319
You've got fair, smooth skin.
You're quite to my taste.

606
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,311
"Coiled dragon swallows tree."

607
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,920
Go back and practice
with your delicate fingers!

608
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,112
Wow! The yin energy
from his palm is so strong.

609
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,632
Kid, your trouser belt has come off!

610
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,071
You're lucky I'm here,
or you would have flashed your bottom!

611
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,800
But you leaped out pretty well.

612
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,791
"A large roc spreads its wings."

613
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,511
We'll throw...

614
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,712
throw, throw, throw, throw, throw, throw,
throw, throw, throw, throw, throw...

615
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,392
Sword! Sword! My sword!

616
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,470
- Leader, shall we...?
- Yes.

617
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,229
Reverse!

618
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,238
Ling Wu Chung!
Observe carefully!

619
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,549
"Swinging sword manoeuvre."

620
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,278
"Wave-like sword manoeuvre."

621
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,077
"Lower-the-sword manoeuvre."

622
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,158
"Whirling sword manoeuvre."

623
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,718
You may not leave!

624
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,519
- Let's do it together!
- Okay!

625
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,711
"Hacking sword manoeuvre."

626
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,719
"Splitting sword manoeuvre."

627
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,478
Yet another group to lose
their souls by the sword.

628
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,393
We are all flesh and blood.

629
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,394
Why do we have to make
such a mess of the world?

630
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,791
Sir, may I ask which sect
you are the grandmaster of?

631
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,952
Brother, what's the point of caring
so much about reputation and fame?

632
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,711
It is the cause of countless disasters
and turmoil in the world.

633
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,478
Sir, your martial arts are so skilful.

634
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,552
Why do you still live
such an itinerant life?

635
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,588
What's the use of
being skilful in martial arts?

636
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,830
Even heroes
are made of flesh and blood.

637
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,113
Once the corrupt and the wicked
have captured your family

638
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,551
then you just become their pawn.

639
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,192
For their safety, I retired from the
martial arts world, and left my family.

640
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,433
Emotions are stronger
than any martial art.

641
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,800
You're a student of the
Hua Mountain Sect.

642
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,278
You have to beware of your sifu.

643
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,351
He's not as righteous as he seems.

644
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,552
Why do you say such things
about my sifu?

645
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,951
So many sects in the martial arts world
advocate righteous platitudes,

646
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,832
but it's just power play.

647
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,990
Years ago, due to differences in opinion
about martial arts in Hua Mountain,

648
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,679
there was
an internal power struggle.

649
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,990
Students were divided into
the chi and the sword sects.

650
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,036
From verbal combat
to physical combat,

651
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,991
the result was dead bodies
strewn all over the place.

652
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,431
At the heart of the matter was
a power struggle to become leader.

653
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,553
Your sifu sacrificed many students to
fulfil his ambition to become leader.

654
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,832
That's why you need to be careful.

655
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,273
How come you know so much
about the Hua Mountain Sect?

656
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,510
If you have a chance in the future,
ask your sifu.

657
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,871
Ask him who Fung Ching Yeung is.

658
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,911
Fung Ching Yeung?

659
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,909
The sword manoeuvres I taught you
are called "Nine Solitary Swordplays."

660
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,311
Each manoeuvre evolved from
manoeuvres that had met with defeat.

661
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,230
In martial arts, how many are willing
to study unsuccessful manoeuvres?

662
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,631
You have to remember them.
Maybe they'll be useful in the future.

663
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,831
Although I did
teach you a few things,

664
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,309
we needn't formalise
a teacher-student relationship.

665
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,069
Let's just acknowledge each other
and be good brothers.

666
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,717
Fung...
Old brother Fung!

667
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,834
MIAO REGION

668
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,790
Sir, we've discovered the Hua Mountain
Sect people are staying in a barbarian inn.

669
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,549
- Stay here, everyone...
- Sir, the civilian clothes are ready.

670
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,879
Change into them.

671
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,199
Think of some way to lure
the Han Chinese to the barbarian inn.

672
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,748
There are strangers downstairs.
I smell blood.

673
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,629
Sifu, we haven't heard from our brother
Ling Wu Chung and sister for so long.

674
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,358
Could it be them?

675
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,670
I'll go down and take a look.

676
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:35,473
Inner chi is like bubbling, flowing water.
Inner peace is like an immobile mountain.

677
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,111
Be patient.

678
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,112
Everyone, sit and meditate
to gather your chi.

679
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,636
Damn!

680
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,319
Is this what you call service?!

681
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,839
There are Han Chinese.

682
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,549
Sifu, do you think
it's our brother?

683
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,239
Help!

684
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,590
Sifu! I'll go downstairs
to check it out!

685
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,398
He's not dead yet.
Carry him upstairs!

686
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,950
You've had a close call.

687
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,229
Thank you.

688
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,270
- Take them all away.
- Yes.

689
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,912
Sifu, as per your instructions,
we've buried the two dead people.

690
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,559
We also found something on them.

691
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,631
Sifu!

692
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,228
It's a warrant issued by
the Imperial Court.

693
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,159
We, from the martial arts world,
never discuss politics.

694
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,550
Just as a river
doesn't interfere with a well,

695
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,751
I don't want to know
about your affairs.

696
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,399
If you don't mind,

697
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,831
please leave
as quickly as possible.

698
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,830
We of the Lam family have suffered
the pains of extermination.

699
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,554
I don't want more people to sacrifice
themselves for me.

700
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,872
Kind sir, I will never forget this
benevolent deed of saving my life.

701
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,589
I'll repay you one day.
Goodbye!

702
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,031
Brother,

703
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,108
take this money with you.

704
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,670
There may still be people who want to
harm you. Buy a sword to defend yourself.

705
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,237
Take it.

706
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,311
You've been too kind to me.

707
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,432
Someday, I will repay
your kindness.

708
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,630
All you kind sirs! Please accept
three bows from me, Lam Ping Ji.

709
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,149
Lam Ping Ji?
The descendant of Mr. Lam?

710
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,709
Lam Ping Ji?
You've been resurrected?!

711
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,631
Ping Ji!

712
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,351
You're Lam Ping Ji?

713
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,911
How time flies.

714
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,230
I haven't seen you
in more than a decade.

715
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,709
- We don't recognise each other any more.
- You are?

716
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,952
I'm Uncle Ngok from Hua Mountain,
Ngok Bat Kwan.

717
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,037
You're Ngok Bat Kwan!

718
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,278
Uncle Ngok, there's hope after all.

719
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,670
You're my only kinsman now.

720
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:57,953
A decade or so ago,
I, Ping Ji, was young and ignorant.

721
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,838
I didn't realise how dangerous
and perilous the world was.

722
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,389
Now, everything's been
distorted beyond recognition.

723
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,279
I, Ping Ji,
am no longer the same Ping Ji!

724
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,832
I understand.

725
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,919
I understand.

726
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,470
What's all this noise about?

727
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,437
The Miao people are having a wedding.

728
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,070
Don't speak so loudly in Chinese here.
Let's split up and look for our sifu.

729
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,593
As the sun and moon bring each new day,
our gods bless our tribe.

730
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,552
The Chief is risen again!

731
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,273
The fake groom doesn't need
to pretend any longer.

732
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,749
Let's inspect the goods
that have been delivered.

733
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,678
Yes.
