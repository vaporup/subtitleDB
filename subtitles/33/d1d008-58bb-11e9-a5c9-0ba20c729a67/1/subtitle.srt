1
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:55,666
This is Media-Break.

2
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:59,308
You give us three minutes
and we'll give you the world.

3
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,438
Good morning, I'm Casey Wong
with Jess Perkins.

4
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,408
Top story, Pretoria.

5
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:08,448
The threat of nuclear confrontation
in South Africa escalated today...

6
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,246
...when the military government
of that besieged city-state...

7
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,753
...unveiled a French-made
neutron bomb...

8
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:20,260
...and affirmed that it would use
it as the city's last line of defense.

9
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:25,667
The president's first press conference
from the Star Wars Peace Platform...

10
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,838
...got off to a shaky start
when power failed...

11
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:34,203
...causing a period of weightlessness
for the president and his staff.

12
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,708
We'll be back in a moment.

13
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:39,178
Is it time for that operation?

14
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:42,813
This may be the most important
decision of your life.

15
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,386
So come down and talk to one of our
qualified surgeons...

16
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:48,352
...at the Family Heart Center.

17
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:54,457
We feature the complete line
of hearts by Jensen and Yamaha.

18
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:56,256
You pick the heart.

19
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,559
Extended warranties. Financing.

20
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:01,032
Qualifies for health tax credit.

21
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,840
And remember, we care.

22
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:09,804
Three dead police officers,
one critically injured.

23
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:13,471
Police leaders blame
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

24
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:18,052
...the firm which recently agreed
with the city to fund and run...

25
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,449
...the Detroit Metro
Police Department.

26
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,921
Dick Jones, president of OCP.

27
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:27,460
Every policeman knows
there are inherent risks in his job.

28
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:31,430
If you can't stand the heat,
you better stay out of the kitchen.

29
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:36,970
Although wounded, Officer Frederickson
escaped and identified this man.

30
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:41,234
Clarence Boddicker, unofficial
crime boss of Old Detroit...

31
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:44,845
...sought in connection with
the deaths of 31 officers.

32
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:48,643
Today he is free while doctors
at Henry Ford Hospital...

33
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:52,083
...fight to save
Officer Frank Frederickson.

34
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,255
Good luck, Frank.

35
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,132
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

36
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,429
This violates
my client's civil rights.

37
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:12,130
Make it assault and I can make
bail in cash, now.

38
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,210
Listen, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag...

39
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,471
...and scumbags see the judge.

40
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:22,742
Now get out of my police station
and take Laughing Boy with you.

41
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:31,686
Hi.

42
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,423
Murphy, transferring in
from Metro South.

43
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,657
Nice precinct.

44
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,232
Yeah, pretty good.

45
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:42,227
You work for a living down here.

46
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:43,769
Get your armor and suit up.

47
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:53,346
- No, you can't get a cup of coffee.
- Oh, sarge.

48
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:57,311
- Stark, any word on Frederickson?
- Still listed as critical.

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,579
His wife must be going crazy.

50
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,222
- Murphy?
- Yeah, that's me.

51
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:02,288
- Manson.
- Hi.

52
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,119
What brings you to paradise?

53
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,955
I think the OCP's moving
a lot of new guys here.

54
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,998
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

55
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:16,194
They're gonna manage this department
right into the ground.

56
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,964
- Where you from?
- Metro South.

57
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,106
Welcome to hell.

58
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:20,469
- Murphy?
- Yo.

59
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,239
- Cut 10 guys loose on the east side.
- Try to get up when you're in a jam.

60
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,939
Try to get a Medevac
after you been jammed.

61
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,643
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike.

62
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:46,433
The funeral is tomorrow.

63
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:52,268
Department requests all officers
not on duty to attend.

64
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:57,276
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil as usual.

65
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,544
I don't want to hear any more
talk about strike.

66
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:06,417
We're not plumbers,
we're police officers.

67
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,383
And police officers don't strike.

68
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:16,023
Murphy. Front and center.

69
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,681
Ooh, tiger!

70
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:56,701
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

71
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,005
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

72
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,681
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighborhood.

73
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,748
Glad to know you, Murphy.

74
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:10,285
Pretty neat.

75
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,853
I better drive
until you know your way around.

76
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,262
I usually drive
when I'm breaking in a new partner.

77
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:43,947
You really think
the old man will be there?

78
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,518
Why invite us?

79
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:49,817
All the division heads are bringing
their support teams. It's big.

80
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,857
They're green lighting Delta City.

81
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,996
No way. They never
move ahead of schedule.

82
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,656
Jones has the 209 series ready
and wants to show off.

83
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:01,569
- Tough break, Bob.
- What?

84
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:05,707
When ED 209 ran into serious delays...

85
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,035
...the old man ordered a backup plan.

86
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:10,007
95th floor, have a nice day.

87
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:12,613
Probably to light a fire
under Jones' ass.

88
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,648
- Yeah.
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.

89
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:19,450
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

90
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,749
Fucking Jones, I'd go
straight to the old man if I could.

91
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,086
Don't mess with Jones.

92
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,229
Be careful, man.
I hear Jones is a real shark.

93
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,023
- Who asked you, twerp?
- Bob.

94
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,133
What's the problem with the police?

95
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:36,431
Their union's been bitching ever since
we took over. The usual stuff.

96
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,573
But we'll turn things around.

97
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:42,005
Good. Very good.
Let's get started.

98
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,448
My friends.

99
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,855
I've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

100
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,260
A dream which I've invited
you all to share with me.

101
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:05,032
In six months
we begin construction...

102
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,895
...of Delta City.

103
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:10,495
Where Old Detroit now stands.

104
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,974
Old Detroit has a cancer.

105
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,476
The cancer is crime.

106
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,979
It must be cut out before we
employ the 2 million...

107
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,618
...workers to breathe life
back into the city.

108
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,911
Yes.

109
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:34,321
Shifts in tax structure have made the
economy ideal for corporate growth.

110
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,795
But community services,
in this case law enforcement...

111
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:39,934
...have suffered.

112
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,730
I think it's time
we gave something back.

113
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:02,388
Take a close look
at the track record of this company.

114
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:05,418
You'll see that we've gambled...

115
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,290
...in markets usually regarded
as nonprofit.

116
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:13,431
Hospitals. Prisons.
Space exploration.

117
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,366
I say, good business
is where you find it.

118
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:24,270
As you know, we now have a contract
to run local law enforcement.

119
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,075
But at Security Concepts...

120
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:31,549
...we believe an efficient police
force is only part of the solution.

121
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,780
No, we need something more.

122
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,017
We need a 24-hour-a-day
police officer.

123
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:41,219
A cop who doesn't need
to eat or sleep.

124
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,026
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

125
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,528
Fellow executives...

126
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:53,340
...it's a pleasure to introduce you
to the future of law enforcement.

127
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,908
ED 209.

128
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,617
The Enforcement Droid series 209...

129
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,449
...is a self-sufficient
law enforcement robot.

130
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:45,753
209 is programmed for urban
pacification, but that's just a start.

131
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:49,193
After a successful
tour in Old Detroit...

132
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:54,734
...we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

133
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,406
- Dr. McNamara.
- We'll need a subject.

134
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:58,800
- Mr. Kinney.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,272
- Will you give us a hand?
- Yes, sir.

136
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:06,346
Mr. Kinney will help us simulate a
typical arrest and disarming procedure.

137
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:10,451
Mr. Kinney, use your gun
in a threatening manner.

138
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:14,084
- Point it at ED 209.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:24,625
Please put down your weapon.

140
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:28,201
You have 20 seconds to comply.

141
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:31,566
I think you better
do what he says.

142
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,472
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

143
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:45,816
You are in direct violation
of penal code 113, section 9.

144
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,081
- You have five seconds to comply.
- Help me!

145
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,658
- Four, three, two, one.
- Help me! Help!

146
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:56,525
I am now authorized
to use physical force.

147
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,847
Somebody want to call a paramedic?

148
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:23,149
- Let's go, Johnson.
- You pull the plug on this thing?

149
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,759
All right, don't touch him.

150
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:29,396
- Don't touch him!
- He didn't hear the gun drop.

151
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,065
He didn't hear it?!

152
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:36,337
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

153
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:40,765
It's only a glitch.
A temporary setback.

154
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,341
You call this a glitch?

155
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,473
We're to begin
construction in six months.

156
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,618
This setback could cost us
millions in interest costs alone.

157
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,378
Not necessarily, sir.

158
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:54,385
There's a Robocop program...

159
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,151
...I developed as a contingency
against just this sort of thing.

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,021
Thank you for your concern.

161
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,562
- This is something we could...
- Wait a minute. Dick!

162
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:09,366
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

163
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:12,302
Tell me about your plan.
How long will it take?

164
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:17,241
We've restructured the police
department with some good candidates.

165
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,846
We can go to prototype
within 90 days.

166
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,141
Very good.

167
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,343
Get your staff together. I'll expect
a presentation in 20 minutes.

168
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,545
Thank you, sir.

169
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:38,300
That's how it is in the big leagues.
You see an opening, you go for it.

170
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,400
Watch your back,
Jones will be looking for you.

171
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:46,701
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

172
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,411
Too bad about Kinney, huh?

173
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,705
That's life in the big city.

174
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,407
When do we start?

175
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:57,211
As soon as some schmuck volunteers.

176
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,228
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

177
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:20,039
My son watches this cop show,
TJ Lazer.

178
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:22,836
Lazer does this whenever
he kills a bad guy.

179
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:26,674
- My kid thinks every good cop...
- You don't want to disappoint him.

180
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:32,517
Yeah, well, role models can be
very important to a boy.

181
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,522
Okay, I get a kick out of it.

182
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,993
All units, sector nine...

183
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,665
Well, that's...

184
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,224
Why don't you drive?

185
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,137
Shit!

186
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,504
- I don't believe it!
- What?

187
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,114
You burnt the fucking money!

188
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,182
I had to blow the door!

189
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:05,216
It's as good as marked, asshole.

190
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,946
You stupid, stupid asshole!

191
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,523
- Clarence!
- What do you want?!

192
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:12,717
We got a cop on our tail.

193
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,963
- Come on, speed it up.
- Move it!

194
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,696
- We ain't gonna outrun a cop.
- Slow down.

195
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:28,240
- Are you crazy?
- Shut the fuck up and do it!

196
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:29,274
Just do it!

197
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:33,778
This is 154. We're in pursuit
of suspect. Request backup.

198
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:37,146
- Roger, 154. Backup unavailable.
- Give me your piece.

199
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:41,086
Backup ETA, 15 minutes.

200
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,587
Bobby, get the door!

201
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,555
- Everybody load up!
- Let's go, come on.

202
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,996
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

203
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,902
- What the fuck?
- Where'd he go?

204
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:01,167
Emil!

205
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,435
He's up here!

206
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:18,855
Get him!

207
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,798
Shit, Clarence, my leg.

208
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:30,904
Leon, pick him up.

209
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,336
- Ready?
- Nope, hang on.

210
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:34,975
Bobby.

211
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,078
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no!

212
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,646
Hit it!

213
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:10,903
This is 154. We've located that van
in sector 3D. Where's backup?

214
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,948
Backup unavailable. Estimate 20
minutes before units can arrive.

215
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,544
Well, you call it.

216
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,884
- Let's's do it.
- Okay.

217
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:30,654
Go.

218
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,201
Stay in touch.

219
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:17,109
Freeze.

220
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,977
Okay, let's see those hands.

221
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,378
Nice and easy.

222
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:25,818
Sure.

223
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,422
Mind if I zip this up?

224
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,008
We rob banks, but never
get to keep the money.

225
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,912
We steal money to buy coke,
then sell the coke to make more money.

226
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:59,645
- Capital investment, man.
- Why bother? We could just steal it.

227
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,522
No better way to steal
than free enterprise.

228
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,748
Smoke?

229
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,393
No, those things will kill you.

230
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,655
You want to live forever?

231
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,707
Don't move.

232
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,814
Go ahead and do it.

233
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,322
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

234
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:41,890
Lewis?

235
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,358
Lewis!

236
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,129
I got a situation in here.

237
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,531
Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!

238
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:52,263
Turn around and spread your legs.
That's right.

239
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,836
Lewis, where are you?
You all right?

240
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,144
Hands on your head.

241
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,645
Lewis.

242
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,783
Let us take over from here, Emil.

243
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,170
Your ass is mine.

244
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:28,775
No!

245
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:31,941
Not yet, it ain't.

246
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:46,322
Well, what have we here?

247
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:51,491
You a good cop, hotshot?

248
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,961
Sure you are.

249
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,401
You gotta be some kind of great cop.

250
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,599
Come in here all by yourself.

251
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:06,979
Where's your partner?

252
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,013
Where's your partner?

253
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,515
Guys, the other one was upstairs.

254
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,120
She was sweet.

255
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:17,415
I took her out.

256
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,622
I bet that really pisses you off.

257
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:32,640
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

258
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,038
Do you?

259
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:36,076
I think you're slime.

260
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,783
See, I got this problem.

261
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:45,880
Cops don't like me.

262
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:49,387
So I don't like cops.

263
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,438
Well, give the man a hand.

264
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:11,976
He's all yours.

265
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,524
- Look out.
- Turn around, man.

266
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:29,959
Hey, pretty boy. Hey, over here.

267
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,840
I'm out of ammo.

268
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,847
Me too.

269
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,316
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

270
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:01,425
Okay, fun's over.

271
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:06,998
Okay, let's get out of here.

272
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,165
Good night, sweet prince.

273
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,509
Hey, wait up. Wait up.

274
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,389
Murphy.

275
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,445
- Get him over.
- Clear.

276
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,512
Ventilate him. Get the mask.

277
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,162
Okay, hit the door.

278
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,169
- Let me get pressure.
- Mask him.

279
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:23,842
Got a pressure of 60 pel.

280
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,411
We're gonna have to
intubate this guy.

281
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,578
All right, I got it in.
Breath sounds?

282
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:35,619
- You're in.
- Other side.

283
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,185
- Let's get the mask trousers up.
- Get the clothes off.

284
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,955
Clothes off. Prep him
for a central line.

285
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:47,124
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

286
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,707
Pressure's dropping.

287
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,309
Central line's in, getting
pressure back. Normal saline.

288
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,603
Can you do that, Dad?

289
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,950
- I really have to tell you something.
- Blood pressure?

290
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:06,143
- I've got 40 pel.
- All right.

291
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,863
Coarse D-fib.
Okay, we gotta shock him.

292
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:23,695
Put the Foley in.
Let's blow the mask trousers.

293
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:25,668
- Okay.
- Stand clear.

294
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,807
Coarse D-fib.
Let's shock him again.

295
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:32,843
Clear.

296
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,075
Flat line. Let's go,
intracardiac epinephrine.

297
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:46,288
- All right, it's in.
- No pulse.

298
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:49,463
Let's go ahead and shock
a flat line and then quit.

299
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:51,859
- Okay, everybody stand clear.
- Clear.

300
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:01,674
All right, that's all we can do.
Let's call it.

301
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,468
What's the time?

302
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,107
6:15.

303
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,396
Sharp.

304
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:25,088
It's starting to roll.

305
00:26:27,602 --> 00:26:28,432
Shit!

306
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,803
Bring in the L.E.D.

307
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,409
Lock it down.

308
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,552
- He's on.
- What's the story?

309
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:50,247
- We saved the left arm.
- What?

310
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,825
We agreed on total body prosthesis.
Now lose the arm.

311
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,929
Jesus, Morton.

312
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:00,765
- Can he understand?
- We'll blank his memory, anyway.

313
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:03,403
We should lose the arm.
What do you think?

314
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:07,166
He signed a release when he joined
the force. And he's dead.

315
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,866
We can do pretty much what we want.

316
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,607
Lose the arm.

317
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,849
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

318
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,435
The outer skin will be like this.

319
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,767
It's titanium, laminated with Kevlar.

320
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,308
Go ahead, shake his hand.

321
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,939
Come here often? How you doing?

322
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,852
Got a hell of a grip.

323
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,682
It's 400 foot-pounds.

324
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,017
He could crush
every bone in your hand.

325
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,456
All right, attach it to his shoulder.

326
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,352
I like that.

327
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,400
You're gonna be a bad motherfucker!

328
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:04,439
Hey, hey. Look, he's watching us!

329
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,751
This is for you.

330
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,423
Happy New Year.

331
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,661
We get the best of both worlds.

332
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,063
The fastest reflexes possible today...

333
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,136
...computer-assisted memory...

334
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,433
...and a lifetime of on-the-street
officer programming.

335
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,477
It is my great pleasure
to present to you...

336
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,204
...Robocop.

337
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,881
Come on, come on.

338
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,613
That's for you.

339
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,222
- That's for you.
- Go, Robo.

340
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,078
I'm what you call a repeat offender.

341
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,474
I will offend again.

342
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,912
I get my orders from a higher source.

343
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,949
Shut up, asshole.

344
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,590
- Go through the side.
- A cell is set for observation.

345
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,625
What's this all about?

346
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,888
- Who's this?
- Sergeant John Reed.

347
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,625
It's official OCP business,
so please, get lost.

348
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:34,669
- We got four or five days...
- Hey, this is bullshit!

349
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,068
I take my orders from...

350
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,891
What is this shit?

351
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,744
When at rest, you'll sit in a chair.

352
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,781
Yes, I understand.

353
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,179
What about tracking?

354
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,220
We check his exact location
with one of these.

355
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,055
How does he eat?

356
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,386
His digestive system is simple.

357
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:34,861
This processor dispenses a paste
that sustains his organic systems.

358
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,000
It tastes like baby food.

359
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,068
Knock yourself out.

360
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,281
- Let's start with tracking.
- Give me a grid.

361
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,652
- Got it?
- Clear.

362
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,725
- Target.
- Check.

363
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,294
- Target.
- Check.

364
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,987
Now follow.

365
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,160
Check.

366
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,767
Voice stress analyzer.

367
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,338
- It's up.
- One, two...

368
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,136
...three.

369
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,866
- Check.
- Record.

370
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,242
- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50%.

371
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,047
Full frame.

372
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,607
I think he's ready.

373
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,751
- We got it.
- All right, clear out.

374
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,416
What are your prime directives?

375
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,614
Serve the public trust.

376
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,293
Protect the innocent. Uphold the law.

377
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,220
That's good.

378
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,032
That's very good.

379
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,409
I fucking love that guy.

380
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,714
- It's Supercop.
- Look at that fucking gun.

381
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,025
Shit!

382
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,366
- This guy is good.
- He's not a guy, he's a machine.

383
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,871
What are they gonna do?
Replace us?

384
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,275
Come on.

385
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:12,916
- Reed.
- Yeah.

386
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,591
He needs a car.

387
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,461
Thank you.

388
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,685
Sure.

389
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,057
Anytime.

390
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,825
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy.

391
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,435
I'd buy that for a dollar.

392
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,040
And guess what I'm going to do now?

393
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,545
Happy birthday, Bixby.

394
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,378
Is there anything else, sir?

395
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,248
Empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

396
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,684
Excuse me?

397
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,258
I said, give me your money, all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

398
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,959
Now move!

399
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,455
Open the safe, pops.

400
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,898
Open the goddamn safe!

401
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,228
- We don't have a safe.
- Shit.

402
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,634
There's your goddamned safe!
Now open the son of a bitch.

403
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,209
Quit stalling.
You better open that son of a bitch!

404
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,274
Come on!

405
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,575
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

406
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,713
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

407
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,951
You better open that on the count
of three. One, two...

408
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,752
Fuck me.

409
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,459
Drop the gun. You are under arrest.

410
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,530
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

411
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,852
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.

412
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,658
I'll buy that for a dollar!

413
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,130
No, please!

414
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:47,902
Don't touch me!

415
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,775
- Get away! Get away!
- We don't want your money!

416
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,413
Take it easy.
We don't want to hurt you.

417
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,782
Too much hair.

418
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,754
I know! We'll give her a haircut.

419
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,156
- Hey, hey!
- What?

420
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,764
There's more hair down there!

421
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,935
No! Don't!

422
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,030
Please.

423
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,448
Let the woman go.
You are under arrest.

424
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,641
Shit.

425
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,281
You better back up, pal,
because he's gonna do her!

426
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,719
He's gonna kill her!

427
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,855
He's gonna kill her!

428
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,508
Your move, creep.

429
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,344
No problem. It's okay.

430
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,808
Thank God.

431
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:03,111
I was so scared. Thank you.

432
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,954
Thank you.

433
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,152
Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.

434
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,261
I will notify a rape crisis center.

435
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,067
All units, sector six.
Please close intersections...

436
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,979
I don't care.
Get those men by the stairs, now.

437
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,420
Terrorism has never been a factor
in city politics before.

438
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,754
That changed today
when former councilman...

439
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,123
...Ron Miller entered
City Hall with a gun.

440
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,662
He's on the second floor...

441
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,266
...holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

442
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,132
We do believe that Miller
has killed one of the hostages.

443
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,540
- Lieutenant, what's next?
- We wait. Terrorism is very tricky.

444
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,680
Massive and immediate retaliation
is the best policy. Unfortunately...

445
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,577
- Excuse us.
- Wait, where you going?

446
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,653
Statement, please.

447
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:18,651
Hey, let's have some crowd control.
Come on, get these people back!

448
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,523
- Where the hell are you going?
- Keep him talking.

449
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,331
One quick question here!

450
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,832
Who made you?

451
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,105
Are you invincible?

452
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,771
Okay, Miller. Don't hurt the mayor.

453
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,914
We'll give you whatever you want.

454
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,480
First, don't fuck with me.

455
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,346
I'm a desperate man.

456
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:46,050
And second, I want some fresh coffee.

457
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,422
And third, I want a recount.

458
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,390
No matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back.

459
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,429
- Okay.
- And I want a bigger office.

460
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,700
And I want a new car!
And I want the city to pay for it all!

461
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,567
- What kind of car, Miller?
- One with reclining leather seats...

462
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,868
...that goes really fast
and gets really shitty gas mileage.

463
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,070
How about the 6000 SUX?

464
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:11,943
Yeah.

465
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,910
Okay, sure.

466
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,011
What about cruise control?
Does it have cruise control?

467
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,787
No problem, Miller.

468
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,448
Let the mayor go,
we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

469
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,096
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

470
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,865
When people jerk me off, I kill them!

471
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,958
You want to see?

472
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,266
Get up, Your Honor. Get up!

473
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,637
Get up. Your public wants to see you.

474
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,707
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

475
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,210
We'll get serious now...

476
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,943
...and kiss the mayor's ass goodbye!

477
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,864
Robocop. Who is he? What is he?

478
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,660
Where does he come from?

479
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,565
He is OCP's newest soldier...

480
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,536
...in their revolutionary
crime management program.

481
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,005
OCP spokesmen claim
the fearless machine...

482
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,235
...has crooks on the run
in Old Detroit.

483
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:19,143
Today, kids at Lee lacocca Elementary
got to meet in person...

484
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,148
...what their parents only
read about in comic books.

485
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,445
Excuse me, Robo...

486
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,748
...any special message for all
the kids watching at home?

487
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,851
Stay out of trouble.

488
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,353
More fighting in the Mexican crisis...

489
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,965
...when American troops joined
in a raid with Mexican Nationals...

490
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,399
...against rebel rocket
positions in Acapulco.

491
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,696
Now this.

492
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,136
Red alert. Red alert.

493
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,606
You crossed my line of death.

494
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,308
You haven't dismantled
your MX stockpile.

495
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,482
Pakistan is threatening my border!

496
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,049
That's it, buster.
No more military aid.

497
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,347
Nukem.

498
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,218
Get them before they get you.

499
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,622
Another quality home game
from Butler Brothers.

500
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:09,360
Today labor leaders agreed to sanction
construction of OCP's Delta City...

501
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,593
...thereby creating one million
much-needed new jobs...

502
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,569
...despite questions about worker
safety in dangerous Old Detroit.

503
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,437
Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.

504
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,375
I can't comment on Delta City.
But I will tell you this:

505
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:29,884
Security Concepts projects the end of
crime in Old Detroit within 40 days.

506
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,515
There's a new guy in town.
His name's Robocop.

507
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:39,789
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby-boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

508
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,693
- Handball Tuesday night?
- I would, Bill...

509
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,460
...but I've got some models
coming to my place.

510
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,762
I'd buy that for a dollar.

511
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,305
Welcome to the club, Bob.

512
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:00,880
You're making a name for yourself
in Security Concepts with Robocop.

513
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,347
I try.

514
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,680
Let me in on the bottom line, pal.

515
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,914
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

516
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,719
You know, he's got this killer rep,
but it's a smoke screen.

517
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,694
He's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

518
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,094
Are we talking about
the same Dick Jones?

519
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,532
He's old, we're young. That's life.

520
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,274
I gotta go. I got a meeting.

521
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,125
Congratulations, Bob.

522
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,092
Thanks.

523
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,793
I remember when I was
a young executive at this company.

524
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,265
We used to call
the old man funny names.

525
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,064
"Iron Butt."

526
00:42:58,709 --> 00:42:59,971
"Boner."

527
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,070
Once I even called him...

528
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,313
..."asshole."

529
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,579
But there was always respect.

530
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,915
I always knew
where the line was drawn.

531
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,092
And you just stepped over it,
buddy-boy.

532
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,995
You've insulted me.

533
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,832
And you've insulted this company
with your bastard creation.

534
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,098
I had a guaranteed
military sale with ED 209.

535
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,673
Renovation program.

536
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,037
Spare parts for 25 years.

537
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,645
Who cares if it worked or not?

538
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,484
The old man thought
it was pretty important, Dick.

539
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,022
You know...

540
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,093
...he's a sweet old man.

541
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,597
And he means well.

542
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,431
But he's not gonna live forever.

543
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,701
And I'm number two around here.

544
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,746
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

545
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,878
You just...

546
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,518
...fucked with the wrong guy.

547
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,714
You're out of your fucking mind.

548
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,165
You better pray...

549
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:33,432
...that that unholy monster
of yours doesn't screw up.

550
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,916
You hungry?

551
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,557
No, thanks.

552
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,867
Oh, no.

553
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,642
Damn rebels blew up
the airport in Acapulco.

554
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,938
Great, we were going there next week.
Hey, what was that?

555
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,013
Hey, look.

556
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,522
Bucket-boy's online.

557
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,403
Hey. Hey!

558
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,869
Halt. Stop!

559
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,439
Wait a minute!

560
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,507
- What's going on?
- I don't know. He just left.

561
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,271
He just left?

562
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,081
Roosevelt!

563
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,243
We got a problem.

564
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,491
Out of the way.

565
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:36,289
Take a look at this.

566
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,558
Shit! Call Bob Morton.

567
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,336
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

568
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:00,906
Hello.

569
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,882
I haven't really had a chance
to introduce myself.

570
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:05,816
I'm Anne Lewis.

571
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,949
Do you have a name?

572
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,559
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

573
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,631
That's not really what I meant.

574
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,135
Don't you have a name?

575
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,807
Hold it. Sign right here.

576
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,908
You don't understand. I'm OCP.

577
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,643
Murphy.

578
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,311
It's you.

579
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,018
You really don't remember me?

580
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,578
Excuse me.

581
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:41,891
I have to go.

582
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,556
Somewhere, there is a crime happening.

583
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,023
Stop!

584
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,232
- What did you talk to him about?
- Nothing.

585
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,095
- Shit.
- Shit.

586
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,228
Stop!

587
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,772
Hey, you there! Stop!

588
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,074
You're in a lot of trouble, officer.

589
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,778
Come on.

590
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,848
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct.

591
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,024
One of your grunts screws it up,
I'll have your job!

592
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,920
- What's the update?
- Hard to know.

593
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,426
- We have a glitch or what?
- He wasn't designed for somatic rest.

594
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,292
He had a dream. A dream.

595
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,760
This cop questioned him.

596
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,199
I didn't question him.
I asked his name. He didn't know.

597
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,394
Oh, great.

598
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:33,702
Let me make it clear. He doesn't
have a name, he has a program.

599
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,241
He's product.

600
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,379
- Is that clear?
- Sure.

601
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,072
Pull him in.
Run a systems check, the works.

602
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,650
Take him offline
because he had a dream?

603
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,343
What, are you kidding?

604
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,055
Let's get out of here.

605
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:47,612
Listen, Reed.

606
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,519
Try to keep one thing in mind:

607
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:53,059
This project doesn't concern cops.
It's classified.

608
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,697
It's OCP. You got it, mister?

609
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,760
Yeah, I got it.

610
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,327
Good.

611
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,398
Sorry, sarge.

612
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,804
I fucked up.

613
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,674
Forget it, kid.
This guy's a serious asshole.

614
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,785
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

615
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,649
Now fill it up on number seven.

616
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,958
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

617
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:07,992
I'm a good shot.

618
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,605
I can hit you from here.

619
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,949
Hey, man...

620
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,916
...what you reading in there?

621
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,562
You a college boy or something?

622
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:42,600
I'll bet you think you're smart.
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

623
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,834
What do you say we find out, huh?

624
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,903
I'm talking to you!
What do you say, huh?

625
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,611
I'm talking to you!

626
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,247
Drop it.

627
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,124
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

628
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,290
I know you.

629
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:09,465
You're dead.

630
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,658
We killed you.

631
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,661
We killed you.

632
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,666
We killed you!

633
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:33,945
We killed you.

634
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,862
Who are you?

635
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,735
Who are you?

636
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,916
Can I help you, sir?

637
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,315
No.

638
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,122
What is it exactly that you want?

639
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,490
Hey.

640
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,165
You can't enter here.

641
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,864
Wait a second. Hey, just a minute.

642
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,233
This is a restricted area.

643
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:05,874
He's in.

644
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,206
Murphy, it's you.

645
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,742
Murphy, it's you.

646
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:11,204
Welcome, shopper. Let's take
a stroll through your new home.

647
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,835
This is a one-family house
built by ZM Industries.

648
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,013
Situated near schools and shops...

649
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:21,149
...this progressive development
has a growth factor of seven.

650
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,196
Wow.

651
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,902
Can you do that, Dad?

652
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,780
Say, it doesn't matter
who cooks in your family...

653
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,513
...because this kitchen
by Food Concepts...

654
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,420
...makes everything a snap.

655
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,145
Dad.

656
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,379
Come on, get your hat on.
Isn't he cute?

657
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:32,384
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

658
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,906
I really have to tell you something.

659
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,305
I love you.

660
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,584
The master bedroom.

661
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,526
Functional space
with a touch of elegance.

662
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,925
Hey, have you thought it all over?
Why not make me an offer?

663
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,588
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

664
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,103
Okay.

665
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,009
- Shit.
- Let's talk.

666
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,113
Son of a bitch!

667
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,128
There's just something
about the way it sounds:

668
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,392
"Vice president."

669
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,326
It just turns me on.

670
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,367
God, you girls are so great.

671
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,664
I love to be with intelligent women.

672
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,843
Smart is so sexy.

673
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,340
I know.

674
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,405
Sometimes, I could just
think of something...

675
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:42,642
...and it could just get me so horny.

676
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:48,083
Yeah, well, a mind is
a terrible thing to waste.

677
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,350
I get bored so easily.

678
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,799
And you need lots
of stimulation, Bobby.

679
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,961
Yes, I do.

680
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,068
- Don't move.
- I won't.

681
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,242
Bob, save some for me.

682
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,674
Don't worry.

683
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,047
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

684
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,555
How you doing?

685
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,758
Bitches, leave.

686
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,566
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

687
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,934
You gonna call me?

688
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,241
The fuck are you doing?

689
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,973
Do you know who I am?

690
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,640
If you think you'll get away
with this, you got...

691
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,240
Goddamn it!

692
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:53,444
Stop!

693
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:57,459
I'll give you anything you want.
Just, please, don't kill me.

694
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,863
Hello, buddy-boy.

695
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,590
Dick Jones here.

696
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,802
I guess you're on
your knees about now...

697
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,836
...begging for your life.

698
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,306
Pathetic.

699
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,668
You don't feel so cocky now, do you?

700
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:19,006
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it right now.

701
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,206
You know what the tragedy is here?

702
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,078
We could have been friends.

703
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:28,249
But you wouldn't go
through proper channels.

704
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,582
You went over my head.

705
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,487
That hurt.

706
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:39,296
But life goes on. It's an old story,
the fight for love and glory.

707
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,068
It helps if you think of it as a game.

708
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,308
Every game has a winner...

709
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,542
...and a loser.

710
01:00:56,753 --> 01:01:00,382
I'm cashing you out, Bob.

711
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,192
I don't think I want to pay that, Sal.

712
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:29,433
I don't give a shit what you want.
I set the prices here.

713
01:01:29,636 --> 01:01:34,039
Listen, Sal, maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy who owns Detroit.

714
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,299
You want space in my marketplace...

715
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:39,103
...you'll have to give me
a volume discount.

716
01:01:39,312 --> 01:01:41,678
Not into discounts.

717
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:45,647
Joe, show the man what we brought him
for Christmas.

718
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:57,195
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

719
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:06,505
Okay, let me try
to put this in perspective.

720
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,942
You've killed a bunch of cops.

721
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:14,812
Word around is that you've got a lot
of heavy connections downtown.

722
01:02:15,915 --> 01:02:17,974
You make a lot of my friends nervous.

723
01:02:21,921 --> 01:02:23,286
A lot of people...

724
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:25,686
...want to see a guy like me...

725
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:28,823
...put a guy like you out of business.

726
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:30,752
I don't know.

727
01:02:31,064 --> 01:02:32,429
I don't know.

728
01:02:32,732 --> 01:02:35,895
Maybe I'm just not
making myself clear.

729
01:02:38,271 --> 01:02:40,637
I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

730
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,938
But I got the connections.

731
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,574
I got the sales organization.

732
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:49,775
I got the muscle
to shove enough of this factory...

733
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:52,213
...so far up your stupid wop ass...

734
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:54,712
...that you'll shit snow for a year.

735
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:57,014
Frankie,
blow this cocksucker's head off.

736
01:02:59,059 --> 01:03:02,187
Guns, guns, guns!

737
01:03:03,463 --> 01:03:04,953
Come on, Sal!

738
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:08,191
The Tigers are playing tonight.

739
01:03:09,469 --> 01:03:11,266
I never miss a game.

740
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:17,965
Just kidding.

741
01:03:31,658 --> 01:03:32,716
Go!

742
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:59,410
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

743
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:02,945
Fuck you!

744
01:05:15,962 --> 01:05:17,361
Oh, shit!

745
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:40,180
Clarence Boddicker...

746
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,245
...you are under arrest.

747
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:44,184
You have the right to remain silent.

748
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:47,220
Fuck you!

749
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:54,730
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

750
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:57,331
I'm protected, man.
I've got protection!

751
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,404
- You have the right to an attorney.
- What is this shit?!

752
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,675
Goddamn it.

753
01:06:06,946 --> 01:06:10,746
Goddamn it! Listen to me!
Listen to me, you fuck!

754
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:15,751
It's another guy! He's OCP.
He's the senior president.

755
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,853
Anything you say
may be used against you.

756
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,423
It's Dick Jones!

757
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,094
Don't you care, you cocksucker?

758
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:31,062
I work for Dick Jones!

759
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:32,898
Dick Jones!

760
01:06:33,106 --> 01:06:37,839
He's the number two guy at OCP!
OCP runs the cops!

761
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,069
You're a cop!

762
01:06:43,683 --> 01:06:44,650
Cop...

763
01:06:55,628 --> 01:06:58,825
Yes, I am a cop.

764
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:04,436
I don't like it either, but listen!

765
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:06,264
You listen to me, asshole!

766
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:10,306
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force!

767
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,741
Without cops,
this city would tear itself apart!

768
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,540
The union voted for a strike
last night!

769
01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:18,080
We lost five guys last week!

770
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,252
We're getting creamed out there.

771
01:07:30,063 --> 01:07:31,257
Book him.

772
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:32,893
What's the charge?

773
01:07:37,103 --> 01:07:38,934
He's a cop killer.

774
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,869
Shit!

775
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,015
Just give me my fucking phone call.

776
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,482
I understand. The lawyers
will have you out in 24 hours.

777
01:08:00,693 --> 01:08:02,684
Just don't say anything else.

778
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:05,758
Jesus, you really screwed up.

779
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:09,483
Don't you care?

780
01:09:09,996 --> 01:09:13,056
I work for Dick Jones! Dick Jones!

781
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:18,359
I work for Dick Jones!

782
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,734
He runs OCP! OCP runs the cops!

783
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,511
Come in, officer.

784
01:09:27,713 --> 01:09:30,045
I don't usually see anyone
without an appointment...

785
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,716
...but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

786
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,317
You are under arrest.

787
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,709
On what charge?

788
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,049
Aiding and abetting a known felon.

789
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:41,587
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

790
01:09:43,563 --> 01:09:44,587
Better take me in.

791
01:09:44,897 --> 01:09:46,455
I will.

792
01:09:59,912 --> 01:10:01,470
What's the matter, officer?

793
01:10:04,217 --> 01:10:06,014
I'll tell you what's the matter.

794
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:10,222
It's a little insurance policy
called "Directive 4."

795
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,550
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

796
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:20,264
Any attempt to arrest a senior officer
of OCP results in shutdown.

797
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:24,736
What did you think?

798
01:10:26,539 --> 01:10:28,973
That you were
an ordinary police officer?

799
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:31,034
You're our product...

800
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:34,304
...and we can't have our products
turning against us.

801
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:41,342
Still a little fight left in you.

802
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:49,054
Maybe you'd like to meet
a friend of mine.

803
01:10:55,868 --> 01:10:58,428
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

804
01:10:58,638 --> 01:11:01,766
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

805
01:12:12,044 --> 01:12:14,604
Get me Hedgecock!
There's trouble in the tower!

806
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,314
Prepare to fire.

807
01:13:30,022 --> 01:13:32,820
- Wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sake!

808
01:13:33,025 --> 01:13:35,289
- You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it!

809
01:13:35,528 --> 01:13:37,689
- Oh, shit!
- You're maniacs!

810
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:39,427
Fire at will!

811
01:13:58,084 --> 01:13:59,142
Move in!

812
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:00,608
Murphy, it's me.

813
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:05,115
Lewis.

814
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:21,531
Level three! He's on level three!

815
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:22,894
Over here, over here!

816
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,195
Open fire!

817
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,388
It's back.

818
01:15:45,024 --> 01:15:47,356
Big is back.
Because bigger is better.

819
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,360
6000 SUX,
an American tradition.

820
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,425
Good evening.
I'm Jess Perkins with Casey Wong.

821
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,601
Top story: Santa Barbara.

822
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,066
Ten thousand acres
of wooded residential land...

823
01:15:59,271 --> 01:16:01,831
...were scorched in an instant
when a laser canon...

824
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,669
...aboard the Strategic Defense
Peace Platform...

825
01:16:04,877 --> 01:16:06,970
...misfired today
during routine tests.

826
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,173
It was a day of mourning
for the families...

827
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:12,646
...of 113 people known dead
at this hour.

828
01:16:12,852 --> 01:16:15,150
Among them, two former
U.S. presidents...

829
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:17,652
...who had retired
in the Santa Barbara area.

830
01:16:17,857 --> 01:16:20,121
A day of mourning for a country.

831
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:24,092
Police union representatives and OCP
continued negotiations today...

832
01:16:24,296 --> 01:16:27,424
...in hopes of averting
a citywide strike by police...

833
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:30,227
...scheduled to begin
tomorrow at midnight.

834
01:16:30,436 --> 01:16:31,960
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

835
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:35,072
They're still on duty.
But what about tomorrow?

836
01:16:35,274 --> 01:16:38,641
That's the question we put to people
in the crime-plagued Lexington area.

837
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,642
They're public servants.
They got job security.

838
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,644
They're not supposed to strike.

839
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,646
It's a free society.

840
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:49,378
Except there ain't nothing free,
because there's no guarantees.

841
01:16:49,588 --> 01:16:53,080
You're on your own.
That's the law of the jungle.

842
01:16:57,396 --> 01:17:00,058
- Be very careful.
- Excuse me, please.

843
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,358
Remodeling.

844
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,865
Hi, Barbara.

845
01:17:11,977 --> 01:17:14,775
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

846
01:17:15,114 --> 01:17:17,878
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

847
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:21,416
Maybe you could fit me in.

848
01:17:22,955 --> 01:17:24,980
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

849
01:17:28,994 --> 01:17:30,188
You can keep the gum.

850
01:17:38,037 --> 01:17:40,505
Hey, Dickie-boy. How's tricks?

851
01:17:40,706 --> 01:17:42,731
That thing is still alive.

852
01:17:43,108 --> 01:17:44,439
What are you talking about?

853
01:17:44,643 --> 01:17:48,238
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

854
01:17:50,316 --> 01:17:55,117
Take a look at my face, Dick.
He was trying to kill me.

855
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:58,051
He's a cyborg, you idiot!

856
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:01,523
He recorded every word you said.

857
01:18:01,827 --> 01:18:04,387
His memory's admissible as evidence!

858
01:18:05,064 --> 01:18:06,361
You involved me!

859
01:18:08,801 --> 01:18:10,530
You'll have to kill it.

860
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:15,973
Well, listen, chief.

861
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:20,239
Your company built the fucking thing.

862
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,380
Now I gotta deal with it?

863
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:25,544
I don't have time for this bullshit!

864
01:18:25,985 --> 01:18:29,682
Suit yourself. But Delta City
begins construction in two months.

865
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:32,448
That's 2 million workers
living in trailers.

866
01:18:32,658 --> 01:18:37,220
That means drugs,
gambling, prostitution.

867
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:41,829
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

868
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:44,768
One man could control it all...

869
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:46,769
...Clarence.

870
01:18:47,706 --> 01:18:50,573
Well, I guess we're gonna
be friends after all.

871
01:18:51,677 --> 01:18:52,769
Richard.

872
01:19:00,285 --> 01:19:01,809
Destroy it.

873
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,018
Gonna need some major firepower.

874
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,287
You got access to military weaponry?

875
01:19:11,864 --> 01:19:14,264
We practically are the military.

876
01:19:52,604 --> 01:19:54,094
Did you bring the gun?

877
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:58,174
The precinct was deserted. Half the
force didn't show up for work today.

878
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:01,835
Everyone else walks out at midnight.
I guess we're on strike.

879
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,015
I wasn't sure what you needed.

880
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,184
I sort of grabbed things.

881
01:20:08,353 --> 01:20:09,752
Your gun.

882
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,815
You asked for this?

883
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:18,725
I brought you some food.

884
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:21,631
No, thank you.

885
01:20:21,934 --> 01:20:23,458
I'm not hungry.

886
01:20:46,325 --> 01:20:48,225
You may not like
what you're going to see.

887
01:21:23,562 --> 01:21:26,190
It's really good
to see you again, Murphy.

888
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,703
Murphy had a wife and son.
Where are they?

889
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:37,665
Well, after the funeral...

890
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:41,045
...she moved away.
- Where did they go?

891
01:21:42,714 --> 01:21:44,113
She thought you were dead.

892
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,974
She started over again.

893
01:21:49,354 --> 01:21:51,219
I can feel them.

894
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,251
But I can't remember them.

895
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,635
Leave me alone.

896
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:55,714
Happy birthday, Dave. She's from me.

897
01:22:57,089 --> 01:22:59,182
Well, hey, can I have you both?

898
01:22:59,825 --> 01:23:01,258
Sure!

899
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,758
We've had our shots.

900
01:23:04,997 --> 01:23:06,988
I'd buy that for a dollar.

901
01:23:12,838 --> 01:23:15,739
Hey, Emil. How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

902
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:20,002
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.
And nobody popped my cherry.

903
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:22,806
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

904
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:28,511
I get out of jail for free, then
I find this in the prison parking lot.

905
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:32,781
A brand-new 6000 SUX.
Still got the factory sticker on it!

906
01:23:32,991 --> 01:23:34,083
Hey, Clarence!

907
01:23:34,726 --> 01:23:37,286
Joey's got a car just like yours, man!

908
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:40,360
Clarence, what do you think, buddy?

909
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:49,630
What do you got there, Clarence, huh?

910
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:54,071
Whoa, a new toy. Can I play?

911
01:23:56,882 --> 01:23:58,213
Watch this.

912
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:00,078
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

913
01:24:02,487 --> 01:24:03,784
Aw, shit!

914
01:24:06,558 --> 01:24:08,253
- Fuck!
- Nice car, Joe.

915
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,655
- Fuck you, Clarence.
- Let me try that.

916
01:24:10,862 --> 01:24:14,298
Cobra assault canon.
State-of-the-art. Bang, bang.

917
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,968
I like it!

918
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:27,474
- Give it up, faggot little man.
- Get your own!

919
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,112
Come on!

920
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,016
Do it, Emil!

921
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,632
Check this out!
Heads up, you guys!

922
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:01,670
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

923
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,678
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

924
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:06,680
Come on, Emil!
Get your ass in the van.

925
01:25:06,885 --> 01:25:08,910
Come on, lard-ass! Let's move it!

926
01:25:09,121 --> 01:25:11,419
Forget you, faggot!

927
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:06,366
What are you doing?

928
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,779
My targeting system
is a little messed up.

929
01:26:13,985 --> 01:26:15,350
Can I help you?

930
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,787
Aim for me.

931
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,633
- Are you locked in now?
- Yes.

932
01:26:32,637 --> 01:26:34,298
A little more to the left.

933
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,297
Here.

934
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:47,279
- I figure that's dead-on.
- Thank you.

935
01:27:06,338 --> 01:27:08,568
Come on, man, let's smoke him!

936
01:27:10,175 --> 01:27:13,076
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that mother...?

937
01:27:13,278 --> 01:27:15,246
Give that up, man!

938
01:27:15,914 --> 01:27:18,712
Nothing fancy. Just kill him. Emil!

939
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:20,908
- What?
- In the van.

940
01:27:23,388 --> 01:27:27,347
- You should get out of here now.
- Hey, we're partners.

941
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:29,426
Get the car.

942
01:28:05,463 --> 01:28:06,953
Damn it. Shit!

943
01:28:07,165 --> 01:28:08,154
Looking for me?

944
01:28:21,513 --> 01:28:22,480
Cut him off!

945
01:28:22,681 --> 01:28:27,345
Come on! Go on! Cut him off! Go, go!

946
01:28:58,316 --> 01:29:00,750
Okay! Now I got you!

947
01:30:03,381 --> 01:30:04,370
Help me.

948
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:07,411
Don't touch me, man!

949
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,019
Help me.

950
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,129
Shit!

951
01:30:58,069 --> 01:31:00,663
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Clarence!

952
01:31:26,865 --> 01:31:27,889
Okay.

953
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:29,933
I give up.

954
01:31:30,135 --> 01:31:32,069
I'm not arresting you anymore.

955
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:34,564
Hey. Now, wait a second.

956
01:31:41,379 --> 01:31:44,576
Wait a minute. You're taking
this kind of personal.

957
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:46,844
Come on, man.

958
01:31:47,352 --> 01:31:50,549
You're making me nervous.
Come on, you can't do this.

959
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,349
Come on now! Don't mess around!
Hey. Hey!

960
01:31:55,126 --> 01:31:56,354
Now, don't get cute!

961
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:02,896
Die, you bastard!

962
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:05,433
Yeah! Yeah!

963
01:32:05,637 --> 01:32:07,537
All right! All right!

964
01:32:08,072 --> 01:32:10,370
I got him, Clarence! I got him!

965
01:32:37,702 --> 01:32:39,829
Sayonara, Robocop!

966
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:55,676
Lewis!

967
01:32:57,622 --> 01:32:58,714
Lewis!

968
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,822
Murphy, I'm a mess.

969
01:33:07,565 --> 01:33:09,089
They'll fix you.

970
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,866
They fix everything.

971
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:23,743
The police strike could work for us.

972
01:33:23,948 --> 01:33:26,815
We can have ED 209s
in place all over the city...

973
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,213
...and expect immediate
public support.

974
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:32,082
I've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

975
01:33:39,564 --> 01:33:42,727
You're illegally parked
on private property.

976
01:33:42,934 --> 01:33:45,835
You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.

977
01:34:21,339 --> 01:34:22,772
Whatever happens...

978
01:34:22,974 --> 01:34:26,137
...this corporation will live up
to its guiding principles:

979
01:34:26,344 --> 01:34:30,246
Courage, strength, conviction.

980
01:34:32,784 --> 01:34:37,721
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

981
01:34:47,165 --> 01:34:48,757
How can we help you, officer?

982
01:34:49,334 --> 01:34:51,598
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

983
01:34:51,869 --> 01:34:56,329
This is absurd! That thing is
a violent mechanical psychopath!

984
01:34:56,541 --> 01:35:00,978
My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.

985
01:35:01,379 --> 01:35:04,439
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

986
01:35:14,892 --> 01:35:18,089
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

987
01:35:19,097 --> 01:35:21,998
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

988
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:25,959
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

989
01:35:27,105 --> 01:35:29,505
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

990
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,142
I want a chopper! Now!

991
01:35:36,414 --> 01:35:39,042
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

992
01:35:39,417 --> 01:35:42,682
I will board the chopper
with my hostage.

993
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:46,449
Anybody tries to stop me...

994
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:49,285
...the old geezer gets it.

995
01:35:52,363 --> 01:35:55,093
Dick, you're fired!

996
01:35:56,267 --> 01:35:57,325
Thank you.

997
01:36:22,627 --> 01:36:24,857
Nice shooting, son. What's your name?

998
01:36:28,132 --> 01:36:29,224
Murphy.
