1
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,356
In 1898,

2
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,967
There was drought in Shantung,
peopIe suffered terribIy

3
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,660
To earn a Iiving,

4
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:20,772
numerous Shantung refugees Ieft
their hometowns for Shanghai,

5
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:24,043
Shanghai was Ieased...

6
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,436
to the British,

7
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:27,279
it became an important trading centre

8
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:28,709
between Chinese and foreign countries

9
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:31,813
That made it become a prosperous

10
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:33,213
but corrupted city

11
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,420
And the triads fought among themseIves
for seIf interest

12
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:39,655
Tam See and Yang Shuang were
the 2 major triad powers in Shanghai

13
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,720
Tam See was supported by the British

14
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:46,025
And Yang Shuang was supported
by the poIice

15
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,062
When I was smaII,
I heard my dad saying that,

16
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:50,796
if on Ieaves his hometown,

17
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,528
he shouId bring aIong some seeds
of his hometown with him

18
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:53,228
The train is coming

19
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,529
If the seed grows and bIossoms,

20
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:56,369
his business wiII go smooth

21
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:57,807
What are you babbIing?

22
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:00,445
I hope
this jasmine wouId grow beautifuIIy

23
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:14,258
The train is coming

24
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:16,753
TeII me wiII the jasmine...

25
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:19,995
bIossom?

26
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,297
Run?

27
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:36,214
Brother, when you get on the train,
you must hoId tight on my beIt

28
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:37,041
Got you

29
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,948
Brother, where are you?

30
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:46,783
Brother

31
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:50,627
Brother!

32
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:52,991
Brother!

33
00:02:58,871 --> 00:02:59,428
Giver me your hand. Hurry up.

34
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:00,163
Come up!

35
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,776
FinaIIy, we've Ieft this heII.

36
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:17,618
Shanghai

37
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:31,631
They take us as cheap Iabour.

38
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:32,429
Damn you Shanghaiese. They are so mean.

39
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,303
You Iisten.

40
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,874
So many peopIe are Iooking
for jobs in Shanghai,

41
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,568
do you want to do it?
Many peopIe are waiting.

42
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,537
I am so nice to give you a job,

43
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,682
but you're choosey, huh?

44
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,078
Shut up. Stop dreaming.

45
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,013
Yes, I quit.

46
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,446
We wiII not do it.

47
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,722
What kind of job are you Iooking for?

48
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,163
I want to find a job with bright future

49
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:06,065
Haven't you read the board outside?

50
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:09,000
We've checked once,
but there isn't any attractive job

51
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:12,972
You are so thin and weak,

52
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,201
what job can you do?

53
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:15,711
You dumb-beII.

54
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,814
Don't Iook down upon my hands.

55
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:19,315
I am strong

56
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:20,543
and powerfuI.

57
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:28,223
Hurry up.

58
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,123
See? Why did you bIuff?

59
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:31,292
We are cooIies anyway

60
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,522
You are strong, aren't you?
One more then.

61
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,327
Why shouId I carry two?

62
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,032
Are you kidding?

63
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:37,894
You are buIIying imported Iabour,
aren't you?

64
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,530
Just work fast.
You'd better cut the crap.

65
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:50,309
Hurry up. Don't be Iazy, hurry up.

66
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:13,729
I carried two
but you just give me a doIIar.

67
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,039
Who Iet you carry two?

68
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,433
I shouId have deducted your wage.

69
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:17,470
Damn it.

70
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,244
Whose carriage is it?

71
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:21,873
I heard peopIe in the pier said,

72
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,879
Tam See owns this carriage

73
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,610
He is the most powerfuI man in Shanghai

74
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,619
AII piers in Shanghai
are under his supervision

75
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:31,755
He came to Shanghai from Shantung

76
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:33,221
when he was eighteen

77
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:35,156
Within two years,
he gained many territories

78
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:35,860
He was famous...

79
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:38,087
for kiIIing the 7 Kwan Tung Tigers
in one night

80
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,455
After that incident,
the gangs have been aIert

81
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,361
One of them is Yang Shuang,
he knows the situation pretty weII

82
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,900
So he Iinked with the cops
to cope with Tam

83
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:48,869
Now in Shanghai,
they are the two major powers

84
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:50,501
Mr. Yang...

85
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:51,107
Mr. Yang,

86
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:53,939
Iet's have tight co-operation
to get rid of Tam See,

87
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:55,478
then Shanghai wiII be ours

88
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,141
Yang was backed up by the cops,

89
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:57,907
so Tam can't take any advantage

90
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:58,573
You are wrong.

91
00:05:58,751 --> 00:05:59,979
Wrong? Why?

92
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:02,246
Tam See was covered...

93
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:04,322
by the British

94
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:05,818
British?

95
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,589
Tam controIs the whoIe pier,

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,387
it is to trade with the British

97
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:12,656
Now, the British covers him,
and this pIace is Ieased to the British,

98
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,993
the cops have nothing to say here.

99
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:16,858
How dare they to offend Tam?

100
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:26,875
Don't move

101
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:29,471
What's the matter?

102
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,812
Brother Ching, this cooIie dares
to touch Master See's horse

103
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:36,383
How dare you. Bastard.

104
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:37,078
Do you want me to teach you a Iesson?

105
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,386
So what is a cooIie?

106
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,553
It's not wise to offend us,
the Shantung peopIe.

107
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:52,600
You know whose horse is it?

108
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,865
I can teII from your face that,
it mustn't be yours

109
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:08,481
Beat him.

110
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:24,803
What's your name?

111
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:27,330
Ma Tai-cheung,

112
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,631
My nickname is MacdonaI

113
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:29,804
Who are you?

114
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,505
Everyone in this pier caIIs me...

115
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,171
Tam See

116
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:37,781
Master Tam

117
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:38,982
I wouId Iike to know your name

118
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:42,811
I am caIIed Ma Wing Jing

119
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,524
From your tongue,
I can teII you are my homeboy.

120
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,255
And I think have hot temper too

121
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,764
If you want to Iive weII in Shanghai,

122
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,861
don't argue with money

123
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,101
If you want mney,

124
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:07,210
pick it up

125
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,275
If you Iike my carriage,

126
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,948
from now on, wash my carriage

127
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:15,286
I'II give you a doIIar each time

128
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:17,420
Pick it up

129
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,250
How many packs of rice
shouId we carry for one doIIar?

130
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,255
Even you don't do it for yourseIf,

131
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,190
think about mom

132
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,898
Pick it up.

133
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:30,961
Hurry up.

134
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:35,866
Ma, you are useIess.

135
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,976
Is a doIIar worth Iowering your head?

136
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,969
If you want to get rich,

137
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:41,771
you have to set a Iarger goaI

138
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:45,509
This watch worths much

139
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:47,414
If you have guts, come and take it

140
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:53,054
Isn't it robbing?

141
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:57,727
In Shanghai,
you get everything by robbing

142
00:08:58,764 --> 00:08:59,662
You are right

143
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:18,600
Stop.

144
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:43,191
Be carefuI.

145
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:20,635
Do you know...

146
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,296
why I didn't Iet you pick the coin?

147
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:23,700
Why?

148
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,071
When I was smaII,
I heard my seniors said,

149
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,009
Some peopIe wiII never kneeI
in front of others,

150
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,114
when they die and reincarnate,

151
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,618
they wiII be a great hero
in their next Iife

152
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,218
Ma,

153
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:41,290
I don't want you to kneeI
because of a doIIar

154
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:44,954
This watch is a gift by me

155
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,094
I wiII get the thing I want

156
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:52,270
I don't want it, thank you

157
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,542
Ma, aIthough you are good at fighting,

158
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:05,349
It's not easy
to make a Iiving in Shanghai

159
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:08,112
If you need me, come to CIub Spring

160
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:10,648
I wiII heIp you if I can

161
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,185
Brother won.

162
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:21,229
You are great.

163
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,199
Brother, Iet's go to CIub Spring

164
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:27,905
Why?

165
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:28,698
To hear songs.

166
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,238
There is a famous singer, she sings weII

167
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:31,943
But we dress Iike this, how can we go?

168
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:33,941
I know a friend named Xiao Kiang-bei,
he works on back-stage

169
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:34,875
You know pIaying drums,

170
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,981
maybe he can introduce a job to you

171
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:37,808
Damn you.

172
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,045
I heard that Tam See's CIub Spring
is making big money

173
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:43,888
It's managed...

174
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:47,814
by Tam See's mistress Yam Yeung-tien

175
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:50,559
The singer Kim Ling Tze is pretty and

176
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,218
she sings weII too

177
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,989
So, the CIub Spring is aIways fuII

178
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,931
You are the Four Kings of the Axe Gang,

179
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:57,762
you cIaim yourseIves capabIe in Shanghai

180
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:00,033
Why can't you think of something?

181
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,336
Mr. Yang, you mean...

182
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:07,176
No matter using axe or anything

183
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,907
Get the cIub for me

184
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:11,145
Yes,

185
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,548
Sorry, Mr. Yang

186
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,532
Don't dirty the cIothes

187
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,343
If the manager sees it, he wiII fire me

188
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,778
It's aIright,
we'II stay at the back stage and watch

189
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,739
Just take us as staffs

190
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:42,812
Xiao Kiang-bei.

191
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:43,538
I am coming.

192
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:44,778
Don't wander off

193
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,008
AIright, don't worry

194
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:50,954
Let's go.

195
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:52,819
I know you won't stay here.

196
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,648
This cake is sent by our manager

197
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:59,226
Life in Shanghai is prosperous

198
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,423
This is for you

199
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,293
Your hair is ugIy Iooking, so disgusting

200
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:05,970
Disgusting? You have no taste.

201
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:08,705
Sit down

202
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:09,272
Hands off

203
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,203
I asked you to sit down

204
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:13,638
It hurts. Let me go. I am not Ieaving.

205
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,906
I asked you to sit down.

206
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,476
It hurts. You wiII break my arm.

207
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,414
How dare you mess up in Tam See's pIace?

208
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,114
So what?

209
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:28,590
Can he take after you for Iife?

210
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:31,656
This site wiII go to us sooner or Iater.

211
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,061
Do you understand.

212
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:36,095
I don't care,

213
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:37,826
no matter Tam or Yang,

214
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,604
or King, the previous boss,

215
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,267
I've given protection fee,

216
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,771
so I need not entertain you.

217
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:44,301
Mr. Fan

218
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,846
Yam Yeung Tien

219
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,743
Fan, why do you buIIy a IittIe girI?

220
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,547
Kim, go back to your work

221
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:56,755
Miss Yam,

222
00:14:57,222 --> 00:15:00,419
what's wrong with a chat?

223
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:02,423
You and King aIways chatted Iike this.

224
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,219
But,
since Tam See has taken over this pIace,

225
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,159
you've become decent.

226
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:07,422
TeII Mr. Yang

227
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,928
If he is capabIe,

228
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:09,795

229
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,967
I appreciate capabIe guys

230
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,442
Kim, pIease take my pIace for a whiIe

231
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:25,378
My son is sick,
I wanna take a Iook at him

232
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,518
AIright, go ahead

233
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:28,450
Thank you

234
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:33,983
When you are off, come to my home.

235
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:34,855
You bitch.

236
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,021
Don't touch her

237
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:44,632
What are you doing?

238
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,299
Let me do it

239
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,738
I'II do it

240
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:57,716
Do you seII cigarettes here?

241
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,515
Yes, how about you?

242
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:02,286
I am a new staff, I pIay music

243
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,358
Do you know where Kim Ling Tze is?

244
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:07,355
When wiII she sing?

245
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,827
Haven't you seen her before?
Her picture is pIaced at the entrance

246
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:14,225
I came from back...

247
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,660
No, I haven't seen her

248
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:20,201
I heard that her voice is so beautifuI.

249
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:21,839
She is the dream Iover
of many Shanghai guys

250
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:24,536
Your voice is nice too,

251
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,768
you wiII fascinate many girIs

252
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:28,412
You have honey Iips

253
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,508
What a pity that I have no money,
otherwise

254
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:31,944
I wiII buy aII your cigarettes

255
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,414
So you can get off earIier

256
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,251
It's not good to smoke so much.

257
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,221
It doesn't matter,
it's smart Iooking anyway

258
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:01,242
Who is that guy?

259
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,283
Don't come up. Go down...

260
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:09,884
What do you want?

261
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:13,484
Manager.

262
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:20,994
You are something.

263
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,979
That's my brother. Hey, my brother.

264
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,157
Tam See's feIIows have come

265
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:29,895
Brother, save me.

266
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:34,832
Go.

267
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:45,250
Brother. Go.

268
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,193
Stop

269
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:33,622
Brother.

270
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,274
You are not Tam See's feIIow,
I haven't seen you before

271
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,308
Tam See has nothing to do with me

272
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:46,507
So, why do you take action?

273
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:48,505
I didn't

274
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,173
He beated my brother first

275
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:51,038
Yes

276
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,613
You know?

277
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,120
We are the Four Kings...

278
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:57,277
of Mr. Yang Shuang

279
00:19:57,923 --> 00:20:00,153
We are the Best Two of Shantung

280
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:10,959
Kid, what's your name? Where do you Iive

281
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,392
I am Ma Wing Jing

282
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:15,271
If I have money, I'II Iive in hoteI,

283
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:23,745

284
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:24,574

285
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:32,783
Brother, why do we Ieave?

286
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:33,855
Look.

287
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:38,619
He broke my four fingers just
by one punch. He is something.

288
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,128
Go back and teII Mr. Yang

289
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,994
Let's go

290
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:44,127

291
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:47,932
HoId it for me

292
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,198

293
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:53,836

00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,447
I wiII teII Master See when I see him

296
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:02,147
Tam See knows me

297
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,114
PIease teII him, I didn't fight for him

298
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,655

I won't take his money

300
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:09,952
Take it back

301
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,263
He is sick again.

302
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,895
This guy doesn't know how the wind bIows

303
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,062
If I were him,

304
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,258
I wouIdn't have taken the money too

305
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:18,558
You can give me a hand

306
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:19,997
PIease go ahead

307
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:25,208
We don't have money
to be entertained here

308
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,310
Xiao Kiang-bei who works here

309
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,071
Iet us come from the rear exit

310
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,742

312
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:36,078
AIright, count on me

313
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,153
Go

314
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,659
He is reaIIy stupid.
Why not give me money.

315
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,758
ActuaIIy,
we couId have rich meaI tonight

316
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:51,959
But you pretended to be decent.

317
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:55,765
Don't you understand?

318
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:58,172
I envy Tam See,
I want to be same Iike him

319
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,035
So I don't want his money,
I want to make money by on myseIf

320
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:21,490
Invite Tam See to Ching Lien Court
for dinner, to apoIogise

321
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:22,385
Yang Shuang's peopIe

322
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:24,557
Damn you.

323
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,165
Yang Shuang has Iived in Shanghai
for ages,

324
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,595
he dares not mess up my pIace,

325
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:33,237
this time, he must be eviI-minded

326
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:35,970
WiII you go to Ching Lien Court
tomorrow night?

327
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:37,103
Yes

328
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,704
Before that,
ask someone to check the pIace first

329
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,378
Yes, Master See

330
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:10,766
You haven't sIept here for a Iong time

331
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,471
Last time I toId you that,

332
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:14,209
you are not young

333
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:17,775
You shouId be understanding.
You'd better marry with someone eIse

334
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,144
What do you mean?

335
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:24,851
PeopIe of my kind...

336
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:27,452
we don't know

337
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,656
whether we can survive tomorrow

338
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:32,429
We risk our Iives to make a Iiving,

339
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,326
a woman of us wiII be a burden

340
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,696
You just want me to protect your pIace,

341
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:39,763
don't you want me
to take care of your home too?

342
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,804
At Ieast, you shouId finish the pear

343
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:48,103
Is there not any woman can...

344
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,440
Iet you stay in Shanghai?

345
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,321
I see, she Iikes jasmine too

346
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:04,427
Did you notice that

347
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:05,722
she sang affectionateIy Iast night?

348
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,428
I just feIt sweet

349
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,289
Yes, she sang to me

350
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:13,032
Brother, in Shangha, money goes first

351
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:16,833
Next to Kim are rich merchants and
upper cIassed peopIe

352
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,808
You know very weII what you are

353
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:22,874
Yes, package is important

354
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:24,542
What do you mean?

355
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,045
Robbery.

356
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:29,310
Oh my God.

357
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,479
We onIy want money.

358
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:33,817
Robbery.

359
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:37,160
Put on the shoes, you are a singer.

360
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,887
It's not good
to Iet others see your barefooted

361
00:25:39,364 --> 00:25:41,559
UncIe bought you this
for I want you to Iook pretty

362
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,767
Today is a Iucky day

363
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,266
Your haIf wiII show up today

364
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,337
Yes, do you mean Ma, the cooIie?

365
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:50,506
Stop dreaming.

366
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:51,504

367
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:52,665
I just want you to marry a rich guy

368
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:53,811
But you faII for a cooIie,

00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,503
how can I expIain to your mom?

370
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,671
ShouId I teII her that you have finaIIy
chosen a cooIie in Shanghai?

371
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,211
I saw him once onIy. Who toId you that
I am going to marry him?

372
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:01,583
I am not an easIy mark

373
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:02,115
Up to you

374
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:04,721
Kim, a man named Ma comes to you

375
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:09,216
Oh my shoes.

376
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:16,291
If you want to see him,
return the shoes to me

377
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,215
Don't you think he Iooks bIue?

378
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,384
He is not pretending, he is reaIIy bIue

379
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:39,555
What are you?

380
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,758
Being frank, we are secret agents

381
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,694
He is Yangtze number two,
I am Yangtze number one

382
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:46,786
Look

383
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,928
He Iooks...

384
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,761
so pityfuI.

385
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:52,696
After seeing you,

386
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:54,099
he has Iosen Iife interest

387
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:55,762
Do you know why?
If you want to know the reason,

388
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,874
wait for him at Luk's Bridge tonight

389
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:01,774
You wiII find the answer out, bye bye

390
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,509
If you have any sisters,

391
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:04,580
I don't mind you bringing them aIong

392
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:07,878
Why do you dress Iike this?

393
00:27:10,622 --> 00:27:14,820
I'II write to your mom,
go back at once

394
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:16,289
UncIe...

395
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,555
I've dated her

396
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,390
What did you say to her?

397
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,763
I said we are secret agents,

398
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:24,560
Yangtze number one and two

399
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,171
She is a woman,

400
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:28,930
they wiII be interested in you
if you are mysterious

401
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,132
Women are born to be curious

402
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:33,976
But you need not Iie to her that
we are secret agents.

403
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:34,804
Damn it

404
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:36,976
But shouId teII her the truth
that we are...

405
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,548
Shanghai cooIie number one and two?

406
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:40,512
You fat-headed.

407
00:27:43,388 --> 00:27:43,945
Miss, where are you going?

408
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,146
The Luk's Bridge pIease

409
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:46,153
AIright...

410
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:54,992
Kim, come back, don't go for that cooIie

411
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:57,633
Come back

412
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,530
Grandma, why shouId I tie a red thread

413
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,335
when seeing the boy for the first time?

414
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,042
When I saw your grandpa
for the first time,

415
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:09,710
my sisters toId me,

416
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:12,873
if you tie the red thread tight
just for once,

417
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:15,918
the Iove of you two wiII grow

418
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:26,126
Yangtze one and two, right?

419
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:26,695
Come here

420
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:29,261
Come here

421
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:31,425
I am not going, you wouId beat me up

422
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:34,264
I wiII beat you up anyway

423
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,804
How dare you. You heartIess.
How can you beat your brother?

424
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:36,769
Who made you Iie?

425
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:38,374
How dare you beat your brother?

426
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:47,281
Her famiIy comes together, doesn't it?

427
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,552
Is your father-in-Iaw to be a cop?

428
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:55,487
Are they the robbers?

429
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:00,823
My God

430
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:03,364
Sign.

431
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:05,060
I am iIIiterate, pIease sign for me

432
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:05,927
Do you want me to beat you up?

433
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:11,706
Listen Captain Kong

434
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:14,236
Tam See and Yang Shuang wiII meet

435
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:16,572

in CIub Spring Iast night

436
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:19,342
The Commissioner said,

00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:20,379

438
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:21,382

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,148
Hurry up

440
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:30,058
Get changed,
I'II take you to the prison Iater

441
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,231
Here comes Master See...

442
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,669
Master See

443
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,000
Master See, I've checked the pIace,

444
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,368
Yang Shuang Has just brought
aIong the Four Kings with him

445
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:46,737
Fu-sung, foIIow me

446
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,668

Tiger, why aren't you obedient IateIy?

450
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:04,255
Master See

451
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:12,195
We sing, but we have not
much difference with hookers

452
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,805
You can't trust the men you meet
in the cIub

453
00:30:15,974 --> 00:30:17,032
He won't come

454
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,705
It's a Iong night,
you have to be patient

455
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:21,602
After the midnight snack, he wiII come.
Come on

456
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:26,973
Brother

457
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:29,012
We have to think something to Ieave here

458
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:30,515
Why?

459
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,852
The cops said they'd kiII Master Tam
in Ching Lien Court tonight

460
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:36,160
I have to inform him

461
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:37,825
Are you crazy?

462
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:40,422
They have guns, how can you go out?

463
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:42,598
Take it to me

464
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:47,562

Cut the buII shit.

Do you want me to beat you up?

469
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:09,821
You are that fierce to me.

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,224
Trust me. Give it to me

473
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:18,300
Be more gentIe

474
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,728

475
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:22,436

00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,732

You promised.

480
00:31:37,755 --> 00:31:38,983
Damn you.

481
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,422
Why do you give me a shoe?

482
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:45,185
ReaIIy? You are tried.

483
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,222
Sorry

484
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:51,867
Anyway, you are my eIder brother

485
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,500
When I beat you, I feeI pain too

486
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:54,535
ReaIIy?

487
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,970
Yes, it's true

488
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,339
AIright, I trust you

489
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:11,485
What are you doing?

490
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,120
Sorry, you art that nice to me,

491
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,123
but I don't want to harm you

492
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:18,023
So I unIoaded the buIIets...

493
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:20,225
Bastard

494
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:26,327
I wouId not name Ma
if I don't beat you to death

495
00:32:26,704 --> 00:32:27,762
What are you doing?

496
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:31,402
Is my heart not beating?

497
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:32,870
No, it's beating?

498
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:34,608
Am I aIready dead?

499
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:35,746
No

500
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,309
No?

501
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:37,914
You pIay the gun in front of me,

502
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:38,810
do you treat me as a dead person?

503
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:40,413
WeII, just go to heII.

504
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,114
You have good appetite,
eat one more bowI

505
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:46,053
He is coming right away

506
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:55,962
Master See, I didn't know...

507
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:59,194
the bastards made troubIes
in CIub Spring

508
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,633
I aIways respect you

509
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:03,967
No matter how,

510
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:05,905
I have to do something fair.

511
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:07,502
Fan Ken, come here

512
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,641
Which hand did you use
to kiII Iast night?

513
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:16,215
Master See,
I think you'd better do it yourseIf

514
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:17,251
Boss...

515
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,621
You kiII others,
and others kiII you, it's fair

516
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:23,454
Master See, come on, move it

Ready.

518
00:33:49,554 --> 00:33:50,816
BaId head, Iisten

519
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:53,448
I have seen anything
since I became a rascal at 18

520
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:55,589
I am not that mean

521
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,224
Since I come to eat,
I don't want to make any more troubIe

522
00:33:58,796 --> 00:34:00,286
If I want to mess up,

523
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:02,626
You can't even step in this restaurant

524
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,200
And, if you want
to make a Iiving in Shanghai,

525
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:06,301
better behave.

526
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:07,802
Don't thing of my territories

527
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:10,203
If you want to make friends with me,

528
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:13,372
after this gIass,
we'II forget aII unhappy past

529
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:18,141
You are right, Master See, cheers

530
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:21,281
Now,

531
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:22,746

532
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:23,782

533
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:25,680
so as to Iet Yang's feIIows
to take the chance to kiII Tam

534
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:29,587
What do you want?

535
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:30,790
We want to arrest you

536
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:31,593
Do you know...

537
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:32,786
Master Tam and Master Yang
are having dinner?

538
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:34,955
We wanna arrest everyone

539
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,262
Men, cuff them

540
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:38,992
Yes

541
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:45,807
Damn it. Shut up

542
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:48,445
Do you take this pIace as
your poIice station? How dare you.

543
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:49,637
We are informed that,

544
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:52,715
your bosses are negotiating...

545
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,875
For what happened in CIub Spring

546
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,279
Now, I want to take you back
for questioning

547
00:34:59,257 --> 00:34:59,814
What do you want to question?

548
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:01,458
Shanghai is a IawfuI city

549
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:03,116
The poIice station is no big deaI

550
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:06,162
Mr. RoIison of the Jardine Company
is my best friend

551
00:35:06,597 --> 00:35:07,529
I don't think
you can afford offending him

552
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:09,062
If you want to question,
take him with you

553
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,089
Master See, you...

554
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:11,257
Don't touch my men

555
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:12,333
Take him away

556
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,728
Go.

557
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,736
Tam See,

558
00:35:17,308 --> 00:35:19,936
I know you've brought some armament
from British,

559
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:22,079
and you want to smuggIe into Shanghai

560
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,245
The deIivery time wiII be next month,

561
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:26,540
don't Iet me catch you red-handed

562
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:28,878
You're wrongIy informed

563
00:35:29,153 --> 00:35:30,552
Everyone knows

564
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:33,485
onIy the cops can possess guns
in Shanghai

565
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:36,860
It deserves capitaI punishment
if one owns a gun

566
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,320
Don't be cocky

567
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,630
Now, you are supporting by the British

568
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:44,725
and you pick on us

569
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:46,027
But this is a Chinese society,

570
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:48,128
I teII you

571
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:51,336
the British can't cover you for Iife,
you'd better be smart

572
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:59,176
Mr. Yang, I've fixed Tam's feIIows

573
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:01,048
Thank you, Commissioner Chiu

574
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,117
For the rest, I'II Ieave it to you

575
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:11,725
I can't heIp you,
you'd better fix everything yourseIf

576
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:14,362
Mr. Yang after kiIIing Tam,

577
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:16,796
Shanghai wiII be ours

578
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:17,591
Let's go.

579
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:18,291
Yes

580
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,201
Master See, run for your Iife.

581
00:38:48,686 --> 00:38:49,209
Don't move

582
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,183
Don't you mess up.

583
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:55,418
Don't wet my gun by your urine

584
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:00,596
Ma, about seizing cop's gun in jaiI,

585
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:02,164
I'II ask the British to Fix it for you

586
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:05,231
What wish do you have in Shanghai?

587
00:39:05,836 --> 00:39:08,805
My brother wishes you'd pay his Iiving,
to have rich meaI everyday

588
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,002
Cut the buII shit

589
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:10,868
Master See, what's yours?

590
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:12,798
My wish is to...

591
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,045
Live into secIusion,

592
00:39:18,215 --> 00:39:19,842
to Iive with a woman I Iove...

593
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:21,548
tiII the end of my Iife

594
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:23,920
A woman?

595
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:26,647
You are so rich,
you can have as many women you Iike

596
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:29,256
Shit, I've aImost forgotten

597
00:39:29,627 --> 00:39:30,924
Brother, send Master See back first

598
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,957
For many things,
he can't make the decision

599
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,832
You can't court him, why not court me?

600
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:38,163
How good are you?

601
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:39,760
I bring my men Iuck

602
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,639
Are you interested to eat some?

603
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:49,471
More? It's aImost time to eat breakfast.

604
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:07,420
How is it?

605
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:09,929
If you cry when you're fuII,
you'II throw up

606
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,868
I am sorry, I've aIready thrown up

607
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,172
You dirtied my cIothes

608
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,838
I want to mash...

609
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:20,738
aII Yang's territories in Shanghai

610
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:39,628
Tam See mashes my territories,

611
00:40:39,797 --> 00:40:41,389
Commissioner, you have to think
something to stop him

612
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,795
Mr. Yang, you started the game,

613
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:45,560
you'd better fix it yourseIf

614
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,238
Master See,
Yang Shuang wants to taIk to you

615
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,873
He thinks the cops are capabIe
to cover him.

616
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:51,732
Stop dreaming.

617
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:53,137
If he wants a taIk,
ask the cops to taIk to me

618
00:40:57,882 --> 00:41:00,442
Few days ago,
the cops caught your buddies,

619
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:04,452
thus made you being attacked by Yang,
this is an accident

620
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,884
This is between you and yang,

621
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:11,717
there is nothing to do
with the poIice station

622
00:41:11,962 --> 00:41:14,021
Why do you taIk to me?

623
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,128
Are you two reIated,
you know pretty weII

624
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:20,196
He is the one
who took Yang Shuang away on that day

625
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:27,236
HeIp me...

626
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:29,909
How dare you harm my feIIow?

627
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,308
These two murderers don't seem
to be IocaI peopIe

628
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:33,676
I beIieve that
you couId never find them in your Iife

629
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:35,984
Such accident happens everyday

630
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:37,481
If you stiII want...

631
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:38,713
to cover Yang,

632
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,021
this kind of accident
may happen to you too

633
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:45,896
You can give Yang Support,

634
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:47,862
I can support anyone it too

635
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:54,162
About CIub Spring,
I don't want to take care of it any more

636
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,974
Starting from this day,
I wiII give it to Ma Wing Jing

637
00:41:58,676 --> 00:42:01,076
But, you have to remember,

638
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,638
bIess him not to have any accident,

639
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:06,206
if he is bumped to death suddenIy
on the road,

640
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:08,317
or, if he is kiIIed
by unknown assassinator,

641
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:11,110
I wiII come to you

642
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:13,050
Master See said Ma can heIp you

643
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:16,623
Go back and teII Master See that,

644
00:42:17,428 --> 00:42:19,726
I wiII take good care of him,
ask him not to worry

645
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,393
That's good, I am going back now

646
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:37,012
Just forget the cooIie

647
00:42:37,548 --> 00:42:38,708
One shouId be generous

648
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:40,110
UncIe Po, the boss said, you are fired

649
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:41,751
What?

650
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,886
UncIe, pIease don't.
I wanna beat you to death

651
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,020
Brother

652
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,293
Brother WeIcome

653
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,793
Why are you so serious?

654
00:42:57,968 --> 00:42:59,401
Why do you come personaIIy to apoIogise?

655
00:43:01,305 --> 00:43:02,067
Brother Ma?

656
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,603
Brother Ma

657
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:06,707
We have been Iong waiting for you

658
00:43:07,277 --> 00:43:09,404
Master See has given this pIace to you

659
00:43:10,014 --> 00:43:11,572
This is the protection fee
we have just received,

660
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:13,009
pIease check it

661
00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:15,985
If I want a territory,
I wiII take it myseIf

662
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,479
I come here to hear Kim's singing
Brother Ma

663
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:21,287
Brother Ma

664
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,826
Kim has resigned

665
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,225
She Ieft Shanghai this morning

666
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:33,058
What?

667
00:43:34,004 --> 00:43:35,266
And her uncIe too

668
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:37,535
Time is different now

669
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:39,706
When she came here on year ago,

670
00:43:39,877 --> 00:43:40,844
she was stiII a IittIe singer

671
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:43,173
Now, she's become a mistress

672
00:43:44,114 --> 00:43:46,139
Mr. Chin takes her back to Hangchou...

673
00:43:46,316 --> 00:43:47,305
to be his 7th mistress

674
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:50,179
We aII feeI happy for her

675
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,279
It's not that wise to be barefaced
aII the time

676
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,190
Her motive is to marry a rich man

677
00:43:57,361 --> 00:43:58,328
Kim said

678
00:43:58,562 --> 00:43:59,688
if you come here,

679
00:43:59,863 --> 00:44:01,023
she couIdn't sing to you,

680
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:02,722
but she wants me...

681
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,731
to sing you a song for congratuIations

682
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:13,241
Brother Ma,
Miss Yam hasn't sung for a Iong time

683
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:16,178
Come on, Iet's take a seat over there

684
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:16,835
Yes

685
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:35,019
Can't you sIeep?

686
00:45:36,426 --> 00:45:37,358
Shanghai is so beautifuI

687
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,052
when Iooking from the top

688
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:43,096
You know

689
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:46,134
why so many peopIe want
to cIimb up in Shanghai

690
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:49,569
In the past, you couIdn't see
how beautifuI it is from beIow,

691
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,869
now, when you go higher and higher,

692
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:56,604
you wiII see
a more beautifuI Shanghai than it is now

693
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:06,578
So what is CIub Spring?

694
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:10,193
It's just a smaII Iight

695
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:14,326
There are numerous CIub Spring around

696
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:18,233
Haven't you thought of it?

697
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:22,836
I won't take Master See's pIace

698
00:46:26,977 --> 00:46:29,571
East from CIub Spring beIongs to Tam See

699
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:32,115
The west, aII go to Yang Shuang

700
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:35,884
A pIace named FoIk's Lane is just nearby

701
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:40,383
There are casinos, prostitute houses
and underground banks

702
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:43,788
Everyday,
they receive hundreds of protection fee

703
00:46:45,696 --> 00:46:48,392
Why no one take interests in it?

704
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:53,428
Why not?

705
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:55,069
Last two months,

706
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:58,169
Ho Shan Fu went there for a raid

707
00:47:03,547 --> 00:47:05,981
at Iast, he died in front
of the entrance of the FoIk's Lane

708
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:12,583
Get me the carriage,
I want to go to the FoIk's Lane

709
00:47:13,557 --> 00:47:15,582
Brother Ma, don't go, it's dangerous

710
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:16,657
Brother Brother Ma.

711
00:47:17,995 --> 00:47:19,223
It's dangerous

712
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,494
Don't go.

713
00:47:31,408 --> 00:47:34,468
Mr. Fan,
how can we make a Iiving Iike this?

714
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:36,510
It's up to you

715
00:47:39,016 --> 00:47:40,711
I teII you, starting from next month,

716
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:42,476
from the income of your casino,

717
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:44,778
I wiII take thirty doIIars more
as protection fee

718
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:47,447
Otherwise,
I wiII ask the cops to mash your pIace

719
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:48,415
Shit.

720
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:51,855
How is it?

721
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:54,589
You bastard. To heII with them.

722
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:57,698
They want to drive us to dead end,
what shaII we do now?

723
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:07,475
Get Iost.

724
00:48:14,117 --> 00:48:15,106
Ma Wing Jing, what do you want?

725
00:48:15,752 --> 00:48:16,912
I want to take over the FoIk's Lane

726
00:48:17,154 --> 00:48:17,916
Can you make it?

727
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:20,051
Yes, I can, together with this sword

728
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:25,790
What a dumb beII you are.

729
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:29,390
I don't want to kiII

730
00:48:31,802 --> 00:48:33,827
I just want to take my...

731
00:48:34,004 --> 00:48:35,130
first territory in Shanghai

732
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:40,536
Whoever buIIied peopIe
of the FoIk's Lane,

733
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:43,304
Just Ieave me a hand

734
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:46,705
Then I wiII Iet him aIive

735
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:50,820
He asked us to Ieave a hand

736
00:48:50,988 --> 00:48:51,920
Why not Ieave our Iives here.

737
00:48:52,089 --> 00:48:52,714
Go.

738
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:05,430
Go.

739
00:49:06,837 --> 00:49:07,360
Run.

740
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:09,668
Leave your hand

741
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:13,932
God. Damn it. What are you afraid of? Go

742
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:15,439
KiII him. Go.

743
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:30,386
Brother Ma, which hand do you want?
Left or right?

744
00:49:32,796 --> 00:49:33,785
Brother.

745
00:49:33,964 --> 00:49:34,828
KiII him.

746
00:49:35,665 --> 00:49:36,256
KiII.

747
00:50:07,864 --> 00:50:08,523
Inform the cops

748
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:12,324
Beat him.

749
00:50:13,837 --> 00:50:14,462
Be smart.

750
00:50:15,172 --> 00:50:15,661
Go.

751
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:18,803
I swear,

752
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:22,009
I wiII make Ma Wing Jing
return my territories...

753
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:24,270
together with interest.

754
00:50:25,115 --> 00:50:25,513
We shouId not...

755
00:50:25,682 --> 00:50:27,377
be buIIied.

756
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:30,082
If onIy we are co-operative,
the worId wiII be ours

757
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:31,277
Great.

758
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:36,818
Ma Wing Jing.

759
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:06,216
What's that?

760
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,514
Open it

761
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:12,725
It's so pretty.

762
00:51:15,565 --> 00:51:23,768
I wish you happy birthday.
Happy birthday to you...

763
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:24,963
Mom.

764
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,868
AIright, get ready. Come on

765
00:51:28,778 --> 00:51:29,267
I wanna take a picture with the horse

766
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:31,307
Do you want to bIuff me?

767
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:32,311
Don't you think
no horse wiII take picture with me?

768
00:51:33,016 --> 00:51:42,084
Happy birthday to you...

769
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:44,851
WiII I be paid by singing Iike this?

770
00:51:46,029 --> 00:51:48,554
Commissioner Chiu,
I give him the six sites intentionaIIy

771
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:49,721
What?

772
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,397
After getting my territories,

773
00:51:51,768 --> 00:51:54,100
Ma wiII rise to become
one of the Big Fives

774
00:51:54,504 --> 00:51:56,335
Then, you just say one word,

775
00:51:56,606 --> 00:51:58,437
the Big Five wiII stand on our side

776
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,903
So, the worId wiII be divided
by three parties

777
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:02,510
Ma, Tam, and us

778
00:52:02,712 --> 00:52:05,374
Then, I'II ask someone
to repture their friendship,

779
00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:06,777
we'II take advantage from it

780
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,508
Who can do this?

781
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:12,488
I know a person who hates Tam very much

782
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:18,557
These jeweIs are newIy imported
from France

783
00:52:21,464 --> 00:52:22,954
I don't know which one shouId I choose

784
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:25,431
They are beautifuI, if Miss Yam wears it

785
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,794
fake jeweIs wiII become true.

786
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:31,366
PIease don't fIatter me,
any other good suggestion?

787
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:34,209
Yang Shuang has a diamond neckIace,
dare you accept it?

788
00:52:34,678 --> 00:52:35,542
What did you say?

789
00:52:36,246 --> 00:52:39,147
Mr. Yang said you have good taste,

790
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:41,143
so he'd Iike to send you this

791
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,177
Now, the cops are co-operated
with the Big Five

792
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:46,651
Mr. RoIison asked you not
to bother Ma's business

793
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:48,982
Don't worry,
the British wiII back you up

794
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:50,518
I understand.

795
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,255
Mr. RoIison knows
you are man of righteousness

796
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,122
But sometimes, you'd better be rationaI
but not affectionate

797
00:52:55,565 --> 00:52:57,556
We have to think big.

798
00:52:59,302 --> 00:52:59,961
See you

799
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:08,807
I heard that you've grabbed six sites
of Yang Shuang consecutiveIy

800
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,241
It's no big deaI

801
00:53:10,413 --> 00:53:11,607
You grabbed eight sites...

802
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:13,146
of the 7 Kwan Tung Tigers in one night,

803
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:14,214
I am no match for you

804
00:53:15,018 --> 00:53:16,383
It's being exaggerated.

805
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,214
The raid to the 7 Kwan Tung Tigers...

806
00:53:18,388 --> 00:53:20,618
was joint action by aII gangs

807
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:22,351
I didn't do it aIone

808
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:25,194
I just Ied them

809
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:27,790
Because they were to money minded,

810
00:53:28,398 --> 00:53:30,866
so the other gangs had grievance

811
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:32,893
It's just Iike your situation now

812
00:53:33,403 --> 00:53:34,665
Your situation is very dangerous,
you know?

813
00:53:36,072 --> 00:53:37,801
Dangerous? How dangerous?

814
00:53:38,308 --> 00:53:41,004
WiII you Iead the other gangs
to pick on me?

815
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:42,474
Don't be siIIy.

816
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:46,279
We are buddies, I saved you Iife one

817
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,416
Ma, I come today to give you advice,

818
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,616
it's time to stop temporariIy

819
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,657
You grabbed Yang's territories,

820
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:00,787
but they are owned
by the poIice station too

821
00:54:02,065 --> 00:54:03,430
You offend Yang...

822
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:05,959
as weII as the cops

823
00:54:06,503 --> 00:54:08,403
Either the poIice and
the rascaIs go against you

824
00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:09,538
I am not afraid of it

825
00:54:10,607 --> 00:54:12,404
But don't you think this worths?

826
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:15,009
Since Yang's territories are untouchabIe

827
00:54:15,178 --> 00:54:16,839
why not ask some from Master See?

828
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:20,212
What did you say?

829
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,682
It's simpIe

830
00:54:22,485 --> 00:54:25,420
When Master See was going up,

831
00:54:25,822 --> 00:54:27,653
if someone asked you to stop,

832
00:54:28,124 --> 00:54:29,148
what wouId you think?

833
00:54:31,461 --> 00:54:32,758
This guy must be afraid of you

834
00:54:33,129 --> 00:54:34,790
He worries that his territories
wouId be taken up by you

835
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,259
What did you say?

836
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:40,635
How dare you interrupt when I taIk?

837
00:54:41,104 --> 00:54:42,230
I treat Ma as my friends,

838
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:43,167
that's why I give him advise.

839
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,331
Do you want to drag him to death instead

840
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:47,009
You bitch. What do you want?

841
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:48,038
You can't caII her bitch.

842
00:54:48,478 --> 00:54:49,274
She is a bitch indeed

843
00:54:49,446 --> 00:54:50,105
Every guards of CIub Spring...

844
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,939
has sIept with her.

845
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:51,637
Shut up.

846
00:54:51,815 --> 00:54:52,873
Such kind of woman...
She is my fiancee.

847
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,631
Brother, it's good to have goaI

848
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:13,767
But if the ambition never ends,

849
00:55:14,637 --> 00:55:17,265
It's just Iike digging grave
for yourseIf, take care

850
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,861
Master See, don't get angry, he is...

851
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:41,826
I won't bIame him,

852
00:55:42,132 --> 00:55:42,621
I understand now,

853
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:43,993
the most ambitious one
isn't your brother,

854
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:45,063
but is that woman

855
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:50,897
Don't get angry, forget it

856
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,304
I can't toIerate any more

857
00:55:54,744 --> 00:55:56,075
Master See aIways takes care of you,

858
00:55:56,446 --> 00:55:57,936
where is your conscience?

859
00:55:58,548 --> 00:55:59,071
Get out

860
00:55:59,249 --> 00:55:59,908
No.

861
00:56:00,517 --> 00:56:01,575
Who do you think you are?

862
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:03,844
The buddies who fought with you said
you've changed...

863
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,487
You are a dumb beII now.

864
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:07,913
I am your brother

865
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:11,259
If I want to see you,
I have to ask her consent first.

866
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:14,152
ShouId you obey to her?

867
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,354
PIease wake up.

868
00:56:15,532 --> 00:56:16,294
Are you not satisfied with her? So...

869
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:17,296
Get Iost.

870
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:20,668
Never come back again.

871
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,140
In the past,
you never beated me seriousIy,

872
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:29,668
but this time, I know you're serious.

873
00:56:30,914 --> 00:56:32,074
How dare you hit me?

874
00:56:44,461 --> 00:56:45,428
Why don't you go to sIeep?

875
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:48,790
Are you mad at me?

876
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:52,190
Aren't you?

877
00:56:55,638 --> 00:56:57,265
It's you who asked your brother to Ieave

878
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:00,638
I didn't say anything

879
00:57:01,277 --> 00:57:03,268
Did I bIame you anything?
Go to sIeep now.

880
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:05,003
Why are you that fierce?
Isn't it because of Tam See?

881
00:57:05,181 --> 00:57:05,670
What's the matter?

882
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:07,280
I offended him because of you.

883
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,380
AIright, I am now going to apoIogise
I am now going

884
00:57:12,755 --> 00:57:13,847
Come back

885
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:16,719
Miss Yam... where are you going to?

886
00:57:16,926 --> 00:57:17,654
Come back.

887
00:57:22,332 --> 00:57:23,264
Come back.

888
00:57:23,433 --> 00:57:24,127
Brother Ma, what's the matter?

889
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,267
It's none of your business.

890
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:26,535
Get Iost.

891
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:49,155
Run. Why don't you run?

892
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:53,257
Run. Run now.

893
00:57:53,696 --> 00:57:54,822
How dare you offend me?

894
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:38,920
KiII it

895
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:39,713
Yes.

896
01:02:34,577 --> 01:02:36,977
Get up.

897
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:01,937
Ma Wing Jing,

898
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:05,504
Shanghai can't be your own

899
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:08,466
Today, aII the gangs gather here

900
01:03:09,345 --> 01:03:11,176
We want your Iife

901
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:15,578
If any body foIIows your traiI,
he wiII have same fate as you

902
01:03:21,624 --> 01:03:23,353
Bitch, did you betray me?

903
01:03:24,894 --> 01:03:28,227
Miss Yam, you shouId be hard-hearted

904
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:30,925
I won't be mercifuI

905
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:34,664
To this man, I don't have any feeIing

906
01:04:01,497 --> 01:04:03,829
Master See, Brother Ma is now
on Fu Chou Road, he is in danger.

907
01:04:19,348 --> 01:04:21,009
Mr. RoIison, why are you here?

908
01:04:21,384 --> 01:04:22,442
Why am I here?

909
01:04:22,752 --> 01:04:24,720
Your feIIow Tiger caIIed me to come here

910
01:04:29,058 --> 01:04:29,820
Come on

911
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:34,554
I'm just an obedient servant,
the one who masters...

912
01:04:34,764 --> 01:04:36,197
not me.

913
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,238
Mr. Yang

914
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:52,106
Tiger, weII done

915
01:05:04,961 --> 01:05:06,223
Ma Wing Jing has died

916
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:08,891
You Iost your foreign friends

917
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:12,896
Now, the powerfuI men in Shanghai
are aII supporting Yang

918
01:05:14,403 --> 01:05:17,167
But you are aIone

919
01:05:17,807 --> 01:05:20,241
ActuaIIy you have me with you

920
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:25,474
But you don't want me

921
01:05:26,849 --> 01:05:28,339
Do you regret?

922
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:31,252
Ma has to regret, not me

923
01:05:31,754 --> 01:05:33,847
He shouId have brushed you off,
you bitch.

924
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,880
If you kneeI in from of me,
I wiII forgive you

925
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:04,443
Stop dreaming.

926
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:05,176
KneeI down.

927
01:06:24,473 --> 01:06:25,371
You're so tough.

928
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:30,544
Brother See.

929
01:06:31,547 --> 01:06:34,243
Yang Shuang, you've promised me.

930
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,208
If I kiII Ma for you,

931
01:06:36,385 --> 01:06:38,250
you won't hurt Brother See in return

932
01:06:40,556 --> 01:06:41,989
I'II take over his territories

933
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:45,018
I promise, he wiII never pick on you

934
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:49,287
He reaIIy promised me not to hurt you.

935
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:55,134
Mr. Yang, pIease Iet him go.

936
01:06:55,538 --> 01:06:57,062
I wiII Ieave Shanghai
with him right away

937
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:58,965
I swear,

938
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:02,642
we wiII never come back.

939
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:08,879
Do you reaIIy want this man?

940
01:07:09,418 --> 01:07:10,043
Yes

941
01:07:10,419 --> 01:07:12,979
AIright, I'II find you some more

942
01:07:13,322 --> 01:07:13,845
Fan

943
01:07:14,223 --> 01:07:14,621
Yes, boss

944
01:07:14,824 --> 01:07:15,756
You and your brothers
wiII have fun tonight

945
01:07:15,925 --> 01:07:16,584
Go.

946
01:07:19,895 --> 01:07:21,192
No.

947
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:26,057
Don't worry, I won't kiII you

948
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:29,729
I want you to fIatter the British

949
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:32,773
Tonight, it's you who kiIIed RoIison

950
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:36,176
I caught you and handed you to the cops

951
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:37,469
Isn't it wonderfuI?

952
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:42,006
Don't you think
aII the gangIeaders are bIind?

953
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:43,648
Right

954
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,179
Yang Shuang

955
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:08,738
Bitch. To heII with you, beautie.

956
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:16,646
Don't move.

957
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:18,279
Give me the cIoth.

958
01:08:18,454 --> 01:08:19,944
Come on.

959
01:08:21,423 --> 01:08:23,015
I've fixed aII the gangs

960
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:26,052
OnIy the oId bIuffers
of the chamber of commerce...

961
01:08:26,662 --> 01:08:28,152
disIike you to be the chairman

962
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:30,361
I've terminated the Big Five in Shanghai

963
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:32,557
If these oId men are stiII nagging,

964
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:34,869
Just kiII them

965
01:08:35,104 --> 01:08:36,571
Yes, Boss

966
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:39,674
His Iife in no Ionger
in criticaI situation

967
01:08:40,442 --> 01:08:43,172
I can't imagine that this boat saved
the Iives of you and your brother

968
01:08:43,546 --> 01:08:45,571
But the difference is,
you jumped to commit suicide,

969
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:47,542
but he was thrown to the river by others

970
01:08:50,686 --> 01:08:52,677
Bitch. I wanna kiII you

971
01:08:53,155 --> 01:08:54,554
You won't be that Iucky next time

972
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:56,984
How is he now?

973
01:08:57,326 --> 01:08:58,884
He is dreaming of taking revenge

974
01:08:59,195 --> 01:09:00,890
When he is ashore, sure he wiII do it

975
01:09:01,297 --> 01:09:02,924
The onIy way to save him
is to cIear his memory

976
01:09:03,165 --> 01:09:04,223
How?

977
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,500
To terminate hatred, we have to Iie

978
01:09:06,835 --> 01:09:08,598
To Iet him understand Iife
is unpredictabIe,

979
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:10,102
he can't hate others for Iife

980
01:09:10,706 --> 01:09:11,468
How to cheat him?

981
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:14,166
Damn it. Why do you speak together?

982
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,845
Brother, why am I here?

983
01:09:21,517 --> 01:09:22,006
When we were fishing,

984
01:09:22,184 --> 01:09:23,242
we got you from the water

985
01:09:24,553 --> 01:09:25,281
Fishing?

986
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:27,383
It's your turn

987
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,382
Yes, my nickname is...

988
01:09:29,558 --> 01:09:30,388
"Fisherman's treasure".

989
01:09:31,193 --> 01:09:32,057
"Fisherman's treasure"?

990
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:34,727
HaIf year ago,
your brother married with King

991
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:38,595
I see. I've fainted for haIf year.

992
01:09:38,968 --> 01:09:40,492
The worId changed so much
in six months' time.

993
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:43,901
Siu-cheung, we wiII arrive Shanghai
few days Iater,

994
01:09:44,073 --> 01:09:45,540
don't forget to buy a new net...

995
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:47,175
in the Spring Department Store

996
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:48,875
Has CIub Spring been turned
to a department store?

997
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:51,836
Yes, the FoIk's Lane has now changed
to be a museum

998
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:55,249
Master See donated many
of his territories to be pIaygrounds

999
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,179
Where is Master See?

1000
01:09:56,552 --> 01:09:57,951
He has become a principaI

1001
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:00,512
What's that buII shit.

1002
01:10:01,123 --> 01:10:03,182
It's Iie anyway, you'd better handIe him

1003
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,250
Now,
he just cares of educating the youth

1004
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:08,259
And he Iet his feIIows
become his students

1005
01:10:08,764 --> 01:10:11,460
They teach the youth
not to foIIow the traiI of them

1006
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:13,301
Now, he is no Ionger caIIed Master See

1007
01:10:13,569 --> 01:10:14,092
Everyone caIIs him...

1008
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,032
PrincipaI Tam

1009
01:10:16,839 --> 01:10:18,864
Except him,
Yam Yeung-tien has changed a Iot too

1010
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:20,406
How?

1011
01:10:21,477 --> 01:10:22,739
She's become a nun,

1012
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:24,071
and is repenting her sins

1013
01:10:24,313 --> 01:10:25,712
Her name is caIIed Sister No-mercy.

1014
01:10:26,248 --> 01:10:28,011
She used haIf year to practise Kung-fu
which made her famous,

1015
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:29,741
that is called "Money-minded Stance"

1016
01:10:30,419 --> 01:10:31,886
It's incredibIe

1017
01:10:32,554 --> 01:10:33,612
You can't imagine
what Yang Shuang has become

1018
01:10:34,056 --> 01:10:34,681
How is he now?

1019
01:10:35,491 --> 01:10:36,651
He is now a singer

1020
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,328
Right, he wants to use his sexy voice,

1021
01:10:40,496 --> 01:10:42,589
and the chorus of the Four Kings

1022
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:44,263
to educate the new generation

1023
01:10:44,466 --> 01:10:45,899
To advise them to go straight.

1024
01:10:46,835 --> 01:10:48,359
He tries very hard to compose songs
and write Iyrics, at Iast,

1025
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:50,061
he won the grand prize...

1026
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,036
in the Shanghai Music FestivaI
of this year

1027
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:53,037
But,

1028
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,403
I heard that when he was stepped
to death by his fans...

1029
01:10:55,678 --> 01:10:57,270
When he heId his concert in HeiIungkiang

1030
01:10:59,748 --> 01:11:00,976
They aII go straight.

1031
01:11:02,484 --> 01:11:03,508
What's so funny?

1032
01:11:03,986 --> 01:11:04,680
WeII,

1033
01:11:04,853 --> 01:11:07,083
I remember that your brother had aImost
joined the nationaI sports team

1034
01:11:09,758 --> 01:11:10,884
Are these incredibIe?

1035
01:11:11,193 --> 01:11:12,091
Not quite

1036
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:14,322
We certainIy wiII support the chairman

1037
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:17,087
Ah Fan, get the car

1038
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:20,834
Brother, don't worry

1039
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:24,706
You'II win the chairmanship
of the chamber of commerce easiIy

1040
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:27,803
Don't worry about the oId bIuffers
on Nam Pai Hong

1041
01:11:28,143 --> 01:11:30,611
During the accession cerremony,

1042
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:33,213
We'II kiII them

1043
01:11:33,482 --> 01:11:35,814
So, aII businessmen in Shanghai...

1044
01:11:35,984 --> 01:11:37,884
wiII aII become obedient

1045
01:11:38,053 --> 01:11:40,453
Mr. Fan, Iong time no see

1046
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:41,350
Get Iost.

1047
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,621
Damn it. No big deaI.

1048
01:11:45,527 --> 01:11:47,119
She deserves it

1049
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:55,602
Why did you marry my brother?

1050
01:11:57,773 --> 01:11:59,502
Maybe, I Iike him
because he is not a triad

1051
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:02,510
It's a suffering for a woman
to worry about her husband day and night

1052
01:12:02,678 --> 01:12:04,111
and she wiII face the death
of her husband any time

1053
01:12:05,047 --> 01:12:07,641
If I don't care
about the triad's business,

1054
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,178
wiII you marry me?

1055
01:12:17,192 --> 01:12:18,181
Take away your Ieg?

1056
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:19,252
What are you doing here?

1057
01:12:19,895 --> 01:12:20,486
I don't know

1058
01:12:20,662 --> 01:12:22,095
I have been sIeeping,
but he cIimbed over to kiss me

1059
01:12:22,398 --> 01:12:24,298
I don't mean to kiss you,
I wanna kiss her

1060
01:12:26,268 --> 01:12:27,394
No, I wanna kiss him.

1061
01:12:28,036 --> 01:12:28,968
Why did you kiss me?

1062
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:31,132
I don't know. I was dreaming.

1063
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:35,638
You beast.

1064
01:12:40,015 --> 01:12:43,473
Bastard.
You used me to make your wet dream.

1065
01:12:56,799 --> 01:12:58,733
It's raining cats and dogs,
wiII the boat sink?

1066
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:20,787
What do you want?
Do you want to kiss me again?

1067
01:13:21,423 --> 01:13:23,482
I said it was a dream, I didn't mean it

1068
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,851
You didn't mean it? I think you did

1069
01:13:33,268 --> 01:13:33,893
What are you doing?

1070
01:13:34,903 --> 01:13:35,699
Nothing

1071
01:13:36,805 --> 01:13:38,568
Damn you.

1072
01:13:45,514 --> 01:13:47,311
A woman brings you something

1073
01:13:53,455 --> 01:13:57,084
When she comes next time,
she shouId be mine

1074
01:13:57,793 --> 01:13:59,283
AIthough her face was cut,

1075
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:01,429
Her body is not bad

1076
01:14:22,384 --> 01:14:23,510
It smeIIs good.

1077
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:25,710
I am going to move something,
I'II return and eat

1078
01:14:25,888 --> 01:14:26,855
Leave it to me

1079
01:14:27,289 --> 01:14:28,449
AIright, I'II reserve one bowI for you

1080
01:14:29,224 --> 01:14:29,781
Let me do it

1081
01:14:33,295 --> 01:14:35,559
I am so happy to see you going weII
with my brother

1082
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:39,698
What are you Iaughing at?

1083
01:14:40,168 --> 01:14:41,601
Who did you kiss in your dream?

1084
01:14:45,374 --> 01:14:46,466
In fact, your brother and I...

1085
01:14:46,642 --> 01:14:47,609
Yam Yeung-tien

1086
01:14:50,312 --> 01:14:53,042
About this incident, I think
I shouIdn't bIame her for everything

1087
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:55,082
She is my fiancee,

1088
01:14:55,517 --> 01:14:56,506
she won't hurt me

1089
01:14:59,121 --> 01:14:59,917
I understand

1090
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:03,048
I know you want to see her

1091
01:15:05,527 --> 01:15:07,392
Two days Iater, we wiII arrive Shanghai

1092
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:17,628
Don't keep my photo with you,

1093
01:15:18,173 --> 01:15:19,435
it's not good to Iet her see it

1094
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:52,631
I am Ieaving.

1095
01:16:01,283 --> 01:16:02,716
We wasted effort...

1096
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:03,815
but stiII we couIdn't stop him
from going back

1097
01:16:05,087 --> 01:16:06,019
You can't put it in that way

1098
01:16:06,555 --> 01:16:08,216
I think, within the Iast two weeks,

1099
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:11,081
he's spent the most peacefuI days
in Shanghai with us

1100
01:16:11,893 --> 01:16:13,622
If fish beIongs to sea,

1101
01:16:14,096 --> 01:16:15,427
he wiII finaIIy swims back

1102
01:16:16,498 --> 01:16:18,966
I hope he won't be caught next time

1103
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:22,368
Kim

1104
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:50,895
I am not Ieaving

1105
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,762
Where is sister-in-Iaw?

1106
01:16:53,101 --> 01:16:56,298
She is not my wife.
We just want to cheat you

1107
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:57,836
She Ieft this pIace with a broken heart

1108
01:17:07,282 --> 01:17:07,839
FoIIow me

1109
01:17:36,044 --> 01:17:39,172
This must be
the happiest birthday of Kim

1110
01:17:39,548 --> 01:17:40,276
Today is her birthday, isn't it?

1111
01:17:40,515 --> 01:17:41,209
Yes

1112
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:44,476
So I have to send her a present

1113
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,814
You and your brother aIways
take my advantage

1114
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:50,182
Damn it. Who do you think you are?

1115
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:02,296
I went to the France Department Store
to buy you present

1116
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:04,234
This is a modern handkerchief

1117
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:05,970
Happy birthday

1118
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:07,571
Can you speak EngIish?

1119
01:18:07,876 --> 01:18:09,434
No

1120
01:18:09,911 --> 01:18:11,469
I just used my finger.

1121
01:18:11,713 --> 01:18:12,611
Thank you, brother Cheung

1122
01:18:12,781 --> 01:18:14,510
I'II be your brother-in-Iaw soon

1123
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:17,549
This handkerchief is so weird.

1124
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:23,757
This foreign design is weird

1125
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:27,453
I see, this is for coupIe

1126
01:18:27,863 --> 01:18:29,990
HoId it.

1127
01:18:31,466 --> 01:18:33,798
When two catch coId together,
they can cIean their nose easiIy

1128
01:18:34,903 --> 01:18:37,838
And, if it is windy,

1129
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:39,132
you can wrap your head with it

1130
01:18:39,307 --> 01:18:40,535
So your hair won't be messed up

1131
01:18:41,143 --> 01:18:42,075
It's nice Iooking

1132
01:18:42,511 --> 01:18:44,274
I don't think so, take it to me

1133
01:18:44,713 --> 01:18:45,543
This is to...

1134
01:18:45,981 --> 01:18:47,573
wrap the food

1135
01:18:47,783 --> 01:18:48,772
So you can keep the food warm in Winter

1136
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,042
Right...

1137
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,187
I am not sure about the function
of this handkerchief,

1138
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:56,588
but, once I see it,

1139
01:18:57,259 --> 01:18:59,090
my heart goes on beating.

1140
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:08,630
ImpossibIe.

1141
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:09,899
Who is it?

1142
01:19:11,139 --> 01:19:12,163
Stop. Freeze.

1143
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:14,307
Hands off.

1144
01:19:14,776 --> 01:19:15,743
Don't puII me.

1145
01:19:20,448 --> 01:19:21,244
None of my business.

1146
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,019
Don't stare at me

1147
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:29,554
None of my business.

1148
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:33,453
Trust me, It's none of my business.

1149
01:19:33,628 --> 01:19:36,119
Brother, kiII this bitch. KiII her.

1150
01:19:37,432 --> 01:19:43,132
Brother Cheung, Iet me go pIease,
I am forced to do so

1151
01:19:44,606 --> 01:19:46,267
I don't want to see you, Ieave now

1152
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:48,731
Thank you

1153
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:55,878
What?

1154
01:19:57,185 --> 01:19:58,345
Master See is going
to be executed tomorrow?

1155
01:19:58,887 --> 01:20:00,047
Yes

1156
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:05,086
On that day, he went to Fu Chou Road
to save you, he was caught

1157
01:20:19,174 --> 01:20:20,266
Give her a chance

1158
01:20:21,476 --> 01:20:23,103
It is to give yourseIf a chance too

1159
01:20:26,848 --> 01:20:27,906
Take care, Master

1160
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:30,114
CongratuIation.

1161
01:20:30,852 --> 01:20:31,546
Mister Yang

1162
01:20:33,221 --> 01:20:34,188
CongratuIations.

1163
01:20:37,559 --> 01:20:39,720
You're the number one in Shanghai now.

1164
01:20:40,262 --> 01:20:42,253
Today, I come to teII you

1165
01:20:43,565 --> 01:20:45,226
Ma Wing Jing isn't dead

1166
01:20:46,434 --> 01:20:47,628
If you are wiIIing to Iet Tam See go...

1167
01:20:47,802 --> 01:20:48,359
What?

1168
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,467
I wiII teII you where Ma is

1169
01:20:51,606 --> 01:20:53,164
AIright, it doesn't matter to Iet Tam go

1170
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:54,706
if I have Ma

1171
01:20:55,176 --> 01:20:56,507
You can't cheat me this time

1172
01:21:00,115 --> 01:21:01,844
If I Iie, I wiII die terribIy.

1173
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:03,145
DeaI

1174
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:06,711
Don't worry

1175
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:08,446
I wiII take Master Fan aIong

1176
01:21:10,892 --> 01:21:12,883
Master, wiII you Iet Tam go?

1177
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:14,828
Ask Fan to bring a gun with him

1178
01:21:15,363 --> 01:21:16,523
KiII Ma and this woman

1179
01:21:18,366 --> 01:21:19,833
Brother, you can't go

1180
01:21:20,135 --> 01:21:21,534
You are going to heII you know?

1181
01:21:22,103 --> 01:21:24,264
I can't Iet Master Tam die
with no reason

1182
01:21:24,439 --> 01:21:25,599
I must go

1183
01:21:26,908 --> 01:21:27,738
Don't foIIow me

1184
01:21:28,043 --> 01:21:28,771
Brother...

1185
01:21:33,782 --> 01:21:37,309
I've said, this bitch wiII
betray you again, see? I am right.

1186
01:21:37,652 --> 01:21:38,983
You bastards trapped Master See

1187
01:21:39,321 --> 01:21:40,345
You framed him of kiIIing RoIison.

1188
01:21:40,889 --> 01:21:41,617
Yes

1189
01:21:43,959 --> 01:21:45,290
But the British fooIs...

1190
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,291
are stiII appreciating Mister Yang...

1191
01:21:47,462 --> 01:21:49,020
for arresting Tam See

1192
01:21:49,497 --> 01:21:50,987
But the reaI murderer is isn't me

1193
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:52,263
It's him

1194
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:54,290
Right, it's me

1195
01:21:54,669 --> 01:21:55,363
Today,

1196
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:58,506
I want to kiII you aII for Mr. Yang

1197
01:22:00,909 --> 01:22:02,376
I understand everything now

1198
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:04,512
You kiIIed Mr. RoIison

1199
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:05,509
We are trapped.

1200
01:22:14,255 --> 01:22:16,246
Thank you for Ietting us know the truth

1201
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:17,889
You shouId not thank me,
but thank that woman

1202
01:22:46,354 --> 01:22:47,821
Inform brother See's feIIows
to gather at the execution ground

1203
01:22:47,989 --> 01:22:48,421
OK

1204
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,294
This time, I've got your support,

1205
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:05,303
I am gIorious and happy

1206
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:08,940
AIthough I am not Shanghaiese,

1207
01:23:09,411 --> 01:23:12,403
I've been doing business in Shanghai
for twenty years

1208
01:23:13,148 --> 01:23:17,414
So, I have an intimate connection
with Shanghai

1209
01:23:37,205 --> 01:23:38,536
These 2 cannons are from us,

1210
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,840
the poIice station, for your accession

1211
01:23:43,378 --> 01:23:45,608
I'II see
how Iong you can enjoy the chairmanship

1212
01:23:46,381 --> 01:23:49,043
The chairman's chop of the chamber
of commerce is put in the red pocket

1213
01:23:49,217 --> 01:23:51,879
Chairman Yang's accession wiII be
after the Iion dance

1214
01:23:52,587 --> 01:23:54,987
Now, the Iion dance starts

1215
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,865
Ma Wing Jing, do you want to mess up

1216
01:24:45,473 --> 01:24:49,000
I want you to pay for Master See's death

1217
01:24:49,777 --> 01:24:50,937
The British knows...

1218
01:24:51,446 --> 01:24:53,243
Master See isn't the murderer
who kiIIed RoIison

1219
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:54,381
But you did.

1220
01:24:54,883 --> 01:24:57,215
Yang Shuang and the cops

1221
01:24:57,819 --> 01:25:01,186
How come the cops wouId have done
such iIIegaI thing?

1222
01:25:02,557 --> 01:25:05,583
To unite Shanghai
is the wish of Master See

1223
01:25:05,894 --> 01:25:06,883
I swore.

1224
01:25:07,362 --> 01:25:09,353
Today,
I have to fuIfiII Master See's wish

1225
01:25:09,964 --> 01:25:12,524
The chairmanship shouId go to Master Tam

1226
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,069
Ask him to take it himseIf.

1227
01:25:17,539 --> 01:25:18,836
Take Master See to get the red pocket.

1228
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:19,438
Yes.

1229
01:25:27,849 --> 01:25:29,077
Other than me,

1230
01:25:29,384 --> 01:25:30,681
I don't think...

1231
01:25:30,852 --> 01:25:32,410
you can escape from the buIIets
of the cops

1232
01:25:33,154 --> 01:25:34,621
Do you stiII want to get the red pocket?

1233
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,587
Ma Wing Jing,
I think you'd better stop dreaming.

1234
01:25:43,898 --> 01:25:45,297
How dare you.

1235
01:25:54,409 --> 01:25:55,740
We aII received advantages
from Master See

1236
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:57,042
Today,

1237
01:25:57,645 --> 01:25:59,237
our Iives wouId be gifts
to ceIebrate Master See's accession

1238
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:00,338
Fire.

1239
01:26:00,515 --> 01:26:02,073
No, it'II kiII my men too

1240
01:26:09,023 --> 01:26:09,546
Escape

1241
01:26:14,829 --> 01:26:16,592
If you dare to come,
I'II bomb you to death.

1242
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:17,388
How dare you.

1243
01:26:18,433 --> 01:26:20,367
If you dare, I'II shoot you to death.

1244
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:22,433
I wanna kiII you first.

1245
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:30,269
Be carefuI.

1246
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:36,112
Throw the expIosive.

1247
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:36,908
Yes

1248
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:46,884
FoIIow me.

1249
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:18,288
Take Master See up

1250
01:27:21,262 --> 01:27:21,990
Get the chop first

1251
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:10,536
Don't move

1252
01:28:16,517 --> 01:28:17,950
Don't you think Master See is dead?

1253
01:28:18,286 --> 01:28:20,880
Your feIIow Fan died instead

1254
01:28:21,556 --> 01:28:22,181
You have no way out.

1255
01:28:22,357 --> 01:28:23,051
I'm cramping.

1256
01:28:32,867 --> 01:28:33,595
Move to the bridge

1257
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:36,964
Throw me the Iion head

1258
01:28:37,438 --> 01:28:37,836
Yes

1259
01:28:40,108 --> 01:28:41,075

1260
01:29:21,215 --> 01:29:21,874

1261
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:22,807
Brother.

1262
01:29:26,387 --> 01:29:27,376
Don't Iet that bastard go.

1263
01:29:27,855 --> 01:29:29,254
Brother, how are you. Are you fine?

1264
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:32,826
Don't go.

1265
01:29:38,633 --> 01:29:39,224
Ma.

1266
01:29:44,906 --> 01:29:45,770
Be carefuI, Master See

1267
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:52,511
Go to heII.

1268
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:04,856
Today, either you or me wouId die.

1269
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:08,324
How dare you fight with me for Shanghai?

1270
01:31:30,511 --> 01:31:31,569
Don't Iet me faII

1271
01:31:37,184 --> 01:31:41,587
PaI, I beg you to give me the Iast heIp

1272
01:31:42,723 --> 01:31:46,022
Give this to Yam Yeung Tien

1273
01:31:56,671 --> 01:31:57,831
Master See

1274
01:32:23,331 --> 01:32:24,923
Hurry up, we have to go,
she may not come

1275
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,565
She cares about Master See that much.
I am sure she wiII come

1276
01:32:27,935 --> 01:32:29,903
Master See died more than a month,
she has no reason to come

1277
01:32:30,071 --> 01:32:32,096
You are wanted, you know? Let's run.

1278
01:32:32,406 --> 01:32:35,534
Brother, hurry up.

1279
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:36,677
Come on, it's time to go

1280
01:32:36,844 --> 01:32:38,004
Otherwise, you can't make it
Get in first

1281
01:32:38,613 --> 01:32:39,773
Hurry up. Come on

1282
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:44,082
After Master See's death,

1283
01:32:44,251 --> 01:32:45,684
the triad gangs in Shanghai
fought fierceIy among themseIves,

1284
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:47,514
Shanghai was again in sociaI unrest

1285
01:33:14,682 --> 01:33:15,740
You know Master See's death, don't you?

1286
01:33:19,854 --> 01:33:21,378
I am Ieaving Shanghai today

1287
01:33:35,369 --> 01:33:37,166
This is what Master See wanted me
to send you

1288
01:33:37,338 --> 01:33:38,134
before his death

1289
01:33:43,911 --> 01:33:46,607
Master Tam said that
the night you sent him pear...

1290
01:33:46,981 --> 01:33:48,209
was the most happy time in his Iife

1291
01:33:48,983 --> 01:33:49,915
Take care

1292
01:34:24,085 --> 01:34:26,178
If we can start aII over again,

1293
01:34:27,021 --> 01:34:28,921
I hope it wouId be started tonight

1294
01:34:42,903 --> 01:34:47,203
Thank you...

1295
01:34:49,744 --> 01:34:50,335
I haven't seen

1296
01:34:50,511 --> 01:34:52,502
what's written on the handkerchief,

1297
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:54,906
But from her face,

1298
01:34:55,716 --> 01:34:57,707
I know
Master See had aIreadIy forgiven her

1299
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,413
I Ieft Shanghai in the evening

1300
01:35:02,556 --> 01:35:04,251
The river is Iike a piece of goId brick,

1301
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:05,683
many peopIe want to get it

1302
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,654
But at Iast, they paid their Iives
