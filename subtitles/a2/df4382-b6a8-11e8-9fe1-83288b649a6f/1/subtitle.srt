1
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,713
- Good sleep?
- Not bad.

2
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:36,298
So where are we?

3
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:37,591
Where you from?

4
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,926
San Diego.
Left yesterday.

5
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:42,971
So you came Honolulu-Guam-Pago-here?

6
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,390
Long trip.

7
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,058
What do you do?

8
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:49,185
I'm a psychologist.

9
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:51,229
Hey, a shrink.

10
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,565
They've called in everything else.

11
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:54,774
How do you mean?

12
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,527
We've ferried people out of Guam
for the last 2 days.

13
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,488
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians,
you name it.

14
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,992
Everybody being flown to the middle
of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.

15
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,243
What's going on?

16
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:09,497
They're not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?

17
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,082
There was a plane crash.

18
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:13,001
Do you get called in on crashes?

19
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:17,463
I'm on a list of psychologists the FAA
brings in when a plane goes down.

20
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,258
So where exactly are we now?

21
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:22,468
That's where we're headed.
Over there.

22
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:23,803
Here.

23
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,096
Take a look.

24
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:27,890
What is that?

25
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,772
All that for a plane crash?

26
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:37,275
I never mentioned a plane crash.

27
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:54,876
- Any other gear? Watch your step.
- I'd like to call my family.

28
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:58,170
We'll get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.

29
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,715
- I'd like to get started.
- We'll send for you.

30
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,341
- It's critical I see them...
- Who?

31
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:05,011
The survivors. If I don't get to them
in the first 24 hours...

32
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,263
- What survivors?
- The survivors of the plane crash.

33
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:08,889
Plane crash?

34
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,351
I deal in post-traumatic stress
and survival guilt.

35
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,895
Maybe I should talk to someone
who knows what's going on here.

36
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:17,023
- Talk to the ship's psychiatrist.
- I'm a psychologist.

37
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,566
That's why I was sent here.

38
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,484
I told you people I need a phone.

39
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:22,027
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.

40
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,905
That's fine.
Give me a phone, I'll call him.

41
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:26,073
Why are you here?

42
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:28,993
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?

43
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:30,828
Tell him the name
of the book you wrote.

44
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:33,956
Astrophysics You Can Use. It was a
Book-of-the-Month Club Main Selection.

45
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:35,875
Never heard of it.

46
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,170
You really thought he read your book.
You haven't changed.

47
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:41,797
It was written for the layman.

48
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,090
He's not impressed.

49
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,758
Is there a phone in here?

50
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,013
- I've been trying to call my wife.
- Would you stop touching me?

51
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,305
Wait a minute.

52
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:52,141
Beth?

53
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:58,397
Flight quarters.
All units make your flight quarters...

54
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:02,734
...condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail...

55
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,572
Goodman, you been here long?

56
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:08,407
- I've been here 3 hours.
- Welcome aboard.

57
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:10,659
This thing scares the hell out of me.

58
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,996
It's already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...

59
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:17,416
...because the damage is done
to the survivors already.

60
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,335
- Hold on. We'll get to that.
- I don't even know who you are.

61
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,586
I know who you are.

62
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:24,631
Who are you? Navy? Military?
What are you?

63
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:26,591
You ever hear of the OSSA?

64
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:29,469
They don't know who I am.
That should reassure you.

65
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,097
You haven't talked to anyone about this?

66
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:34,975
- I talked to the helicopter pilot.
- What'd you tell him?

67
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:38,770
I told him I was here to see
the plane crash. That's my job.

68
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,148
Plane crash. Good.

69
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:44,192
There was no plane crash.

70
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,403
Spacecraft.

71
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:49,447
A spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.

72
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:51,449
- NASA?
- That doesn't surprise you?

73
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,410
At least it explains the secrecy.

74
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:57,163
The secrecy's critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.

75
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:00,083
What report?

76
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,751
ULF.

77
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,088
I wrote that
for the Bush administration.

78
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,923
And that's our bible here.

79
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:11,678
But that was a report about a possible
encounter with an alien being.

80
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,391
You want to come with me?

81
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:20,603
Oh, boy.

82
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:22,021
About 3 weeks ago...

83
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:25,942
...a ship laying fiber-optic cable
between Honolulu and Sydney...

84
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,736
...hit an obstruction
1,000 feet underwater.

85
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:31,739
Cut this cable here
clean as a shears.

86
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,617
The Navy got interested,
sent out a search ship.

87
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:37,203
It turned out that what did it...

88
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:38,830
...was this.

89
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,124
We took this with side-looking sonar.

90
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,127
This is an aerodynamic fin
longer than a football field...

91
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:45,920
...bigger than any known wingspan.

92
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:48,047
This is the fuselage.

93
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:52,343
This is ultrahigh-res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.

94
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:55,721
There it is, buried
under about 8 yards of coral.

95
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,432
Something's wrong
with that measurement.

96
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:02,270
Pacific coral grows an inch a year.
You can set your watch by it.

97
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,521
That's right.

98
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,608
So you're saying this spacecraft
crashed in the year...

99
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,068
1709.

100
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:12,029
So you're saying this spacecraft crashed
300 years ago?

101
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,739
288.

102
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,907
That's impossible.

103
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:18,577
It's not impossible if this spacecraft
came from an alien civilization.

104
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,372
Wait a minute.

105
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:23,207
You think this is an alien spacecraft?

106
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:25,084
It's not impossible.
It's ridiculous.

107
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:29,088
We think there's an Unknown Life Form on
the spacecraft. That's why you're here.

108
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,134
You are the contact team that
was recommended in the Goodman Report.

109
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,344
We have a biochemist...

110
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:38,264
...to assess the physiology
of the Unknown Life Form.

111
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:41,642
A mathematician, because that'll
probably be our common language.

112
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:45,020
And we have an astrophysicist
to locate its place in the cosmos.

113
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:46,939
- Led by a psychologist.
- Right.

114
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:50,526
Nowadays, the little green men say,
"Take me to your therapist"?

115
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,611
Listen up.

116
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:56,281
"Contact teams meeting
an Unknown Life Form or ULF...

117
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:59,076
...must be prepared
for severe psychological impact.

118
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:03,247
Stress reaction of confronting such life
has not been sufficiently studied...

119
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,916
...and cannot be
entirely predicted in advance.

120
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,002
But the most likely consequence
of contact is...

121
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:10,587
...absolute terror. "

122
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,297
That's from Norman's report.

123
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:15,175
I'm sorry, are these parameters correct?

124
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:19,805
You're saying that you have a spacecraft
over a half a mile long...

125
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,225
...that crashed into the ocean 300 years
ago and it's completely intact?

126
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:24,768
That's right.

127
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:28,981
And the kicker is, our sonar
is picking up a low-level hum.

128
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:30,482
Something's still running inside.

129
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:33,652
There's no way this coral could've grown
faster than an inch a year?

130
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,196
That's what we're going there to see.

131
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:37,239
What?

132
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:38,365
Who says?

133
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,784
Harry, that's a joke, right?

134
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:44,329
This is the greatest scientific
discovery since Copernicus. Bigger!

135
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:47,415
The idea that we're not alone,
it'll change everything.

136
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:51,586
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don't want to see that?

137
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:55,298
I got to say that I resent
this briefing very much.

138
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:56,675
And how's that?

139
00:09:57,217 --> 00:10:00,220
If Norman's report calls for a biologist,
a mathematician...

140
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,639
...an astrophysicist
and a psychologist...

141
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:04,099
...why are you here?

142
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:07,560
Physical protocols
start in a half an hour.

143
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,396
You always wear glasses?

144
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:11,940
I just started wearing these.

145
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:15,985
Are the glasses a problem?
I don't actually need them.

146
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:17,320
They're just for reading.

147
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,864
And they're more of a crutch.
I see fine without them.

148
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:24,536
But they didn't anticipate
I'd be going 1,000 feet under the water.

149
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,204
Do you take prescription medication?

150
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:27,372
No.

151
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:29,249
None at all?

152
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,212
Once in a while
sometimes I might take like a...

153
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:37,340
...a piece of Xanax
or something if I'm nervous.

154
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,883
Something like that.

155
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,218
But not...

156
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:41,970
...much.

157
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,224
Knee surgery. Complete reconstruction
of ACL, right knee.

158
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:50,603
Still have steel pin here, steel pin
here, little medial collateral damage.

159
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:53,231
I see that you have a scar
on your neck.

160
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:54,899
Car accident.

161
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,443
- Were you drinking?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:58,986
But I wasn't driving.

163
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:04,075
Wait, I just want to apologize
for putting your name on the list.

164
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:05,201
Why?

165
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:09,372
When I made the report a few years ago,
I picked names of people I knew.

166
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:10,456
And?

167
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:13,876
I know Ted because of his father.

168
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:15,920
- Yeah, so what?
- Beth was a patient.

169
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:17,713
It's a bogus report.

170
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:20,299
What? Did you tell Barnes?

171
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:23,135
You can't do that.
That's fraud.

172
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:27,223
They came to me, new administration,
right? Political agenda.

173
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:30,810
They said, in case of an alien invasion,
do's and don'ts.

174
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,186
Why didn't you just say no?

175
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,814
$35,000.

176
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:36,357
It paid the down payment
on my house.

177
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:39,568
New administration wanted to prove
they're doing something new.

178
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,071
How'd you come up with this team...

179
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:45,199
...of a biologist, an astrophysicist
and a mathematician?

180
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:46,492
Right.

181
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,494
- How?
- I don't know.

182
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:52,081
It sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.

183
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:54,708
I forgive you, Norman.
I forgive you!

184
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,045
But I don't forgive you for Ted.
He's a pain in the ass.

185
00:11:58,295 --> 00:11:59,546
I'll talk to him.

186
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:01,882
We'll be there 2 hours.
You don't have to be around him.

187
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:05,427
He idolizes you anyways, but I'll talk
to him. I'll buy you dinner.

188
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:09,056
- I'm sorry.
- Your secret's safe with me. Come on.

189
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,309
I can't believe this thing could...
Like a dream.

190
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,228
Have you called your wife?

191
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,646
Why not?

192
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:19,149
This'll be a saturation dive.

193
00:12:19,483 --> 00:12:22,236
You'll be going to a habitat
in 1,000 feet of water.

194
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:25,197
A sub will take you to the Habitat
and you'll transfer aboard.

195
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:29,076
At 1,000 feet, your body
will be pressurized for that depth.

196
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:32,621
You could actually take a quick dip.
The pressure wouldn't bother you.

197
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:36,166
Although I wouldn't recommend it
because the water's so cold...

198
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,294
...you'd freeze to death
in less than 2 minutes.

199
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:41,380
That's the reason for the diving suits.

200
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,549
Your helmet has a rebreather
for your air supply.

201
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,762
Following this briefing, I'll take you
to an onboard dive tank.

202
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:50,472
For the next 8 hours...

203
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:54,142
...you'll train in deep-saturation dive
techniques and emergency procedures.

204
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:56,520
Once you've gone down 1,000 feet...

205
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,273
...if you surface, you'll have to commit
to several days of decompression.

206
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:04,361
There is no real quick return.

207
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:05,946
However, there is a mini-sub...

208
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,490
...that may be used as an emergency
escape vehicle.

209
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,409
But there must be a ship at the surface
to mate to for decompression.

210
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,080
Without decompression,
your body would literally burst.

211
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:18,500
Under these circumstances,
you're very well-controlled.

212
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,212
The dive has been planned well
and professionally monitored.

213
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:48,613
The descent will take about 13 minutes,
descending at 80 feet a minute.

214
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:52,116
It's going to get chilly.

215
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:55,787
Try to relax.

216
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,416
Next time, just tell us
when you're going to push the button.

217
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,426
Mozart...

218
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:12,845
...Horn Concerto in E-flat...

219
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,847
...K-447.

220
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:40,081
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?

221
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,749
- I'm loose.
- You're loose?

222
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,209
I'm loose. I'm loose.

223
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:44,919
I'm uptight.

224
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,046
- We okay?
- We're in the river now.

225
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,255
What river?

226
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:50,758
It's a temperature/salinity
differential.

227
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:53,177
It flows like a river
inside the ocean.

228
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,097
- Under the ocean and there's a river.
- That's right.

229
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:03,479
You okay?

230
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:06,273
Right now, I'm not okay.
Would you please not touch me?

231
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,776
We're both nervous. Yes?

232
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,155
Would you cut that out, please?

233
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:16,700
You're having a stress reaction.
That's Harry's stress reaction.

234
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,207
Those noises we're hearing,
that's normal?

235
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:27,711
Those noises are the water pressure
attacking the sub's integrity.

236
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,298
You know a little something about that,
don't you, Norman?

237
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:34,092
How the pressure
can attack your integrity.

238
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,512
Come on, you be nice this trip.

239
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:39,848
Were you nice last time?

240
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,937
You two want to sit together?

241
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,150
My God!

242
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,903
Norman, look at this, look at this.

243
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,448
Jesus! That's just the fin.

244
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,359
That's the Habitat.

245
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:37,405
The Navy moved it in sections
and set it up as a base...

246
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:40,074
...as soon as the spaceship
was discovered.

247
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:42,452
It's manned by 2 naval personnel.

248
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,164
It will be your home-away-from-home
while we investigate the spacecraft.

249
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,000
It ain't the Motel 6.

250
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:03,347
Approaching docking bay from R-4.

251
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:25,077
All personnel, descent sub one
engaging lock area.

252
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:30,750
You are now depressurized.

253
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,061
We're going to pressurize you now.

254
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:55,316
It's hot in there, but you're going to
feel coolness. That's the helium.

255
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,444
- Helium?
- Was I the only one paying attention?

256
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:02,990
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same
family as fluorine and chlorine...

257
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,034
...hydrochloric acid,
hydrofluoric acid.

258
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,036
That's why we're breathing helium.

259
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,831
Because oxygen at any level
higher than 2.3 becomes toxic.

260
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:14,668
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don't speak balloon.

261
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,920
What?

262
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:20,883
That's my voice. The helium resonates
differently with my vocal chords.

263
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:22,968
"Follow the yellow brick road. "

264
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:25,429
Kiddies, cut it out.

265
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,973
The voice regulators are behind you.
Put them on.

266
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:31,977
The Navy dive team is setting up
a hydraulic robot...

267
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,354
...in the air lock
outside the spacecraft.

268
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,857
We'll use that to open its door.

269
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,735
Is that the door?

270
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:44,573
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint
it before the divers went down.

271
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,410
- How tall is that robot?
- Five feet.

272
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,455
And it's roughly the same size
as an airplane door, isn't it?

273
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:54,166
- Excuse me, Ted.
- I think that's worth taking note of.

274
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,711
Excuse me. Tell them our team
is in place and ready, okay?

275
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,963
This is Habitat to Navy dive.

276
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,175
Has it occurred to anyone
maybe we shouldn't open that door?

277
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:05,093
Why do you say that?

278
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,970
We assume they'll be green...

279
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,680
...or insect-like,
but basically human.

280
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,017
But what if they inhale air
and exhale cyanide gas? It's plausible.

281
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,561
Or live forever,
like a virus or a yeast.

282
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:18,023
But why would you assume that a ULF
would want to kill us?

283
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,609
An immortal creature wouldn't think
killing was right or wrong.

284
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,235
It'd have no concept of it.

285
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:25,488
Instant eradication. It's what all the
serious scientific stuff talks about.

286
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,157
What little there is on the subject.

287
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,325
You did put that in your report?

288
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,910
It's in there.

289
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:37,542
Get us the ETD for team's departure
to surface.

290
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,752
Tell them we're in ready
and thank them.

291
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:42,589
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team's ready to take over.

292
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,425
Descent sub ready
for your return to surface.

293
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:48,595
Thanks for all your help.
We'll let you know what we find.

294
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:02,775
I'm not too thrilled
at the prospect of this.

295
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,944
What if you have to go to the bathroom?

296
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:06,571
Just go down your leg, Ted.

297
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,448
Really?

298
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:10,074
You can urinate in these?

299
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:11,242
You can.

300
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:13,953
The question is, do you want to?

301
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,967
Where's the switch?

302
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,308
Okay, let's go.

303
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,132
All right, Fletcher...

304
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:11,844
...we're at 1,022 feet.

305
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:15,597
The ambient temperature,
34 degrees.

306
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,017
Heading out north-northwest...

307
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,019
...330.

308
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:22,354
It's a firm bottom.

309
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:23,731
Intermittent coral.

310
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:28,527
This is great, you guys.

311
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,053
Look at the size of that thing!

312
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:02,394
My God!

313
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,527
You see that tunnel?

314
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:13,405
That's where we're going.

315
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:17,284
Into the heart of darkness.

316
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,302
We're in the coral pipe now, Fletcher,
approaching the air lock.

317
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:39,431
I'm feeling pressure in my ears.
Is that normal?

318
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:41,766
Just use your equalizer.

319
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:43,977
A little better.

320
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:47,939
The most toxic creatures on Earth
live down here.

321
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:51,484
The venom of the land animal
is nothing by comparison.

322
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:55,613
Even the weakest sea snake
is invariably lethal.

323
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,366
Is that supposed to make me
feel good, Beth?

324
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:01,953
This is our air lock.

325
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,499
It'll take us from a wet
to a dry environment.

326
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,086
We're assuming the inside
of the ship is sealed.

327
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,296
This thing is enormous.

328
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,619
That's not budging, is it?

329
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:27,871
- Turn it at 45 degrees.
- What's happening here?

330
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:29,248
Is that piston broken?

331
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:32,209
Can you get the suction cup
flat to the plane of the door?

332
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,919
Maybe it's the hydraulics.

333
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:36,672
The pressure messes everything up
at this depth.

334
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:40,843
Time for a demonstration
in basic physics, gentlemen.

335
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,101
What is it, Harry?

336
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:50,519
Take a look.

337
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:51,853
It's chipped.

338
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:53,438
All right, it's chipped.
So what?

339
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:56,400
I thought you said this thing
wasn't damaged when it crashed...

340
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,195
...that this titanium alloy was
so super-strong, you can't hurt it.

341
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:01,780
I did.

342
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:05,075
So why does it chip when this scientist
just bangs it with a hammer?

343
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:06,827
Is there heat coming off this thing?

344
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:10,247
You're right. Get out of there.
Back up.

345
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:11,790
Just a minute.

346
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:13,834
I mean, get back now!
Get back.

347
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:16,586
Jesus.

348
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:32,686
Anybody else wonder who the hell
opened that door?

349
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:36,940
How did that happen?

350
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:42,153
I'm not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.

351
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:43,571
All right.

352
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:46,116
We come in peace.

353
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:49,452
Always wanted to say that.

354
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:57,252
Fletcher, inform the Navy
we've gained access...

355
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:59,337
...to the spacecraft.

356
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:02,215
There's a hell of a lot of
radiation shielding in here.

357
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:07,303
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...

358
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:11,057
...and a lot of steam.

359
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,186
It's endless.
We'll stay in touch here.

360
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:28,241
Somebody's been here.

361
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:32,161
There's footsteps
and they ain't ours.

362
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,626
So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?

363
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,211
I'm a little curious.

364
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,006
Break up into 2 squads. We'll
never cover the territory otherwise.

365
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:45,174
Split up?

366
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:49,136
He's got a point. We've only got about
a half-hour of breathing time left.

367
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:51,514
Ted and Harry,
you come with me.

368
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:54,684
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.

369
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:57,895
I think the people who built this place
would call that "divide and conquer. "

370
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:01,482
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead,
we'd be dead already.

371
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:07,822
These guys offer a federal grant to
study the effects of an alien invasion.

372
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:09,740
I told all this to Harry.

373
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,283
You made up the report?

374
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:14,078
No, not all of it. I mean,
I did research on half of it.

375
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:15,454
Who did the other half?

376
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:18,999
I borrowed from, you know,
good writers.

377
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,627
Isaac Asimov, Rod Serling...

378
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:23,629
Rod Serling?

379
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:28,050
Who would've thought anyone even reads
those government reports. You know?

380
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,095
I show up here,
half the Pacific fleet is here.

381
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:34,431
I just didn't know what to do.
I wanted to tell you, that's all.

382
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:38,852
Is this in the same category as,
"Beth, I thought you knew I was married"?

383
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,607
I don't think we have enough oxygen...

384
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,989
- Oh, my God.
- Did you push something?

385
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:53,367
No. It did it on its own.

386
00:28:23,814 --> 00:28:24,981
That must be the cockpit.

387
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:27,359
Hold on.

388
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,741
Look at this. Cross-stress bracing
on the outer hulls.

389
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:37,118
All axes supported.
Look at this stuff.

390
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:40,997
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.

391
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:44,125
It's, like, better than rubber,
better than steel.

392
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:45,752
You know a lot
about this stuff.

393
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:48,505
I studied aeronautical engineering
at M.I.T.

394
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:50,507
Isn't that where you got your Ph. D.?

395
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:53,218
It's where I got mine.
All 3 of them.

396
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:54,636
I hated M.I.T.

397
00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:55,512
Envy?

398
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:56,513
Puberty.

399
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:57,555
How old?

400
00:28:58,056 --> 00:28:59,682
First Ph. D., 18.

401
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:00,892
Damn.

402
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:03,394
One year, Harry.
You beat me by one year.

403
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,313
Let's push on.

404
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:06,606
Let's go.

405
00:29:06,856 --> 00:29:10,235
Man, they didn't tell you how heavy
these things were out of the water.

406
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:14,781
Look at this.

407
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:16,407
Come here.

408
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:21,954
"Trash. "

409
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:23,373
"Basura. "

410
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:25,833
Trash?

411
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:40,765
Oh, God.

412
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:45,353
Jesus!

413
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:48,898
It's human.

414
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:51,275
You mean humanoid.

415
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,445
No, Norman, I mean human.

416
00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:56,030
Blunt force trauma.

417
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:58,908
You can see by the direction
that the fracture runs...

418
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,701
...that he was hit
in the back of the head.

419
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:02,411
What's in his hand?

420
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:04,330
I don't know.

421
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:08,709
What is it?

422
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:14,256
"Smokehouse Almonds"?

423
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,594
My God, it's an American spaceship.

424
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:20,513
It can't be
an American spaceship.

425
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:23,557
It's 300 years old. There weren't
even Americans, let alone spaceships.

426
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,809
It can't be, but it is.

427
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:30,022
Let's see if there's some kind of
flight recorder or data computer...

428
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:32,608
...where we can ring up
some kind...

429
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:34,777
...of a flight history.
I mean...

430
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,368
Look at this. It's in English.
Come here.

431
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:46,830
Okay, good.

432
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:49,208
Right there.

433
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,043
And there.

434
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,509
Look at the dates!

435
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:01,345
Can't be.

436
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:03,597
Could be.

437
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,058
It could be 2043 or 1643.

438
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:08,018
I don't know
which one is weirder.

439
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:18,028
"Unknown Entry Event. "
Press it.

440
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:21,490
You sure?

441
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:28,848
This is Barnes, Norman.

442
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:31,017
Yeah, I can hear you.

443
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:37,315
I can't explain it, but I think
we're inside an American spaceship.

444
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:39,942
It gets better.

445
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:48,201
What the hell is it?

446
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:51,871
Whatever it is, it seems to be
what this bird was designed to do.

447
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:55,917
Go out into space and gather
things like this up and bring it back.

448
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:57,752
Yeah, but back from where?

449
00:32:58,002 --> 00:32:59,503
Don't get too excited, Ted.

450
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:03,215
Turn this thing over,
it'll probably say "Made in Korea. "

451
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:05,009
Somehow I doubt that.

452
00:33:05,343 --> 00:33:06,677
No doors.

453
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:08,971
No hinges of any kind.

454
00:33:10,598 --> 00:33:14,977
I'll bet if you put a laser micrometer
on this, it'd be a perfect sphere.

455
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:19,940
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That's a message in and of itself.

456
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:21,984
- Really?
- What do you mean?

457
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:27,489
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto
to prove his worth as an artist...

458
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:30,993
...Giotto drew a perfect circle...

459
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:32,870
...freehand.

460
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:36,081
Perfection.
It's a powerful message.

461
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,877
- I know what the Zen masters would say.
- What's that?

462
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:43,005
"This ball wants to be caught. "

463
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:46,425
Nobody built this thing
looking into their third eye.

464
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:49,386
They went to a lot of trouble
and they didn't do it for nothing.

465
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:52,890
Something put this thing out there
to get picked up and brought back here.

466
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:56,268
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.

467
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:58,228
Don't you think
that's a little paranoid?

468
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:02,107
No, I'm going to put a video camera
on this thing and keep an eye on it.

469
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,944
Can I ask you something
about this reflective surface?

470
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,447
Yeah, it appears to be mercury,
doesn't it?

471
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:11,033
Except mercury's liquid
at this temperature.

472
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,909
That's not what I'm talking about.

473
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:17,080
What worries me is that
it's reflecting everything but us.

474
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:24,629
I hate to be the one non-scientist
that picks this up, guys.

475
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:26,631
You know what I mean?

476
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:29,801
What do you think it is?

477
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:32,971
I don't know.

478
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,515
Whatever it is...

479
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:38,059
...it's alien.

480
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,988
Okay, an American spacecraft,
materials, technology...

481
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:52,907
...more advanced than what we know,
crashes into the ocean.

482
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,284
Why wasn't it damaged?

483
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:57,287
The materials are
obviously super-strong.

484
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,664
If that's true, why did it chip
when you hit it?

485
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,504
Better:

486
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,339
It didn't crash.

487
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,258
It arrived...

488
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,218
...300 years ago.

489
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:14,637
- From where?
- Not "where. " When.

490
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,348
So you're saying this thing
took a wrong turn?

491
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,601
That's right.
I mean, what if the craft...

492
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,103
...inadvertently flew
into a black hole?

493
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,106
It arrived in our past from its present.

494
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,816
The dates
in the flight record...

495
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:28,484
43, 47.

496
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:31,154
That has to be 2043, 2047.

497
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,573
The image you saw,
what you described...

498
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:36,075
...sounds like a black hole,
a tear in the space...

499
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:37,869
We know
what a black hole is.

500
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,203
I don't know.

501
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:43,291
It's a collapsed star with so much
gravity it's like a vacuum cleaner...

502
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,461
...sucking everything into it,
light, interstellar dust, time...

503
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,754
- Time?
- It's possible, but not plausible.

504
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:51,674
It's more than probable.
It's rudimentary astrophysics.

505
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:54,635
We just haven't been able
to fly into one and prove it.

506
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:17,116
I just got off the horn topside.
They're expecting a bad blow up there.

507
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,118
And they're pulling us out.

508
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,496
Pulling us out? Wait a minute!
What do you mean?

509
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,582
What part of "pull out"
don't you understand?

510
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,584
Extraction.
We're leaving.

511
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:30,379
That's ridiculous. We haven't even
begun to scratch the surface here.

512
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:35,092
If you've ever seen a Pacific cyclone,
what we call a tornado is a little fart.

513
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:38,596
So I suggest you go back
to the dormitory and take a nap.

514
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:41,765
You need to lower your metabolism
before we start the decompression.

515
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:44,935
You're leaving a time-traveling
spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?

516
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:46,603
I'm just following my orders.

517
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,481
We're the aliens' Welcome Wagons.
But, no aliens.

518
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:51,567
- It was made in America.
- What's your point?

519
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:54,778
My point is, I'm a biochemist
and there's no life down here.

520
00:36:55,237 --> 00:36:56,405
What is wrong with you?!

521
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:59,450
That doesn't mean there's
nothing to learn, to explore!

522
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,701
She's right.

523
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:04,496
You guys are the human contact team
for an Unknown Life Form.

524
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:08,167
There is no Unknown Life Form,
so we pull out at 0900.

525
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,210
- Please say something to him.
- What?

526
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,629
I don't know. Do you not have
an opinion about this?

527
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:14,172
I'm delighted
we're going back up top.

528
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:16,008
You know what I mean?

529
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:19,052
This may look like a roadside diner,
but in the meantime...

530
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,055
...my ears won't pop and if I pull
this thing away from my neck...

531
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,600
...I sound like someone's squeezing
my testicles. Let's go home.

532
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:32,816
Barnes is wrong, you know.

533
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,444
You mean,
wrong about the storm?

534
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:38,822
No, about the Sphere.

535
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:41,158
What about the Sphere?

536
00:37:41,408 --> 00:37:42,701
It's alive.

537
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,503
Why do you say that?

538
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:57,632
There's something inside it.

539
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:02,012
How can there be anything inside it?
There's no door, no seams.

540
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:06,307
The Sphere chooses what it will
and won't reflect.

541
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:09,686
Doesn't that seem like the actions
of a conscious being to you?

542
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:15,358
Pop psychology. I think,
for whatever it's worth, you're angry...

543
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:18,153
...towards our friend Ted in there...

544
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:20,530
...because he figured this out
before you did.

545
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:24,576
You really think so?

546
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:27,287
I don't know. This is
my first underwater session.

547
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,627
You're right.

548
00:38:36,296 --> 00:38:38,548
Ted did figure it out first,
didn't he?

549
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:40,967
Good shrinkage.

550
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:51,686
We're all going to die down here,
you know.

551
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:55,273
What?

552
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:57,817
What?

553
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:03,155
You see, it's curious.

554
00:39:04,615 --> 00:39:05,950
Ted did figure it out.

555
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:09,787
Time travel. And when we get back,
we're going to tell everyone...

556
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:13,332
...how it's possible, how it's done,
what the dangers are.

557
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:16,711
But why 50 years in the future, when the
spacecraft encounters a black hole...

558
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:19,505
...does the computer call it
an "Unknown Entry Event"?

559
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,215
Why don't they know?

560
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:22,633
If they don't know...

561
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:25,428
...it means we never told anyone.

562
00:39:25,678 --> 00:39:27,680
And if we never told anyone...

563
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,057
...it means we never made it back.

564
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,433
Hence...

565
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:33,686
...we die down here.

566
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,897
Just as a matter
of deductive logic, Norman.

567
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:47,449
Damn, I wish I could
get inside that Sphere.

568
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,087
- What's wrong?
- Talk to Mr. Barnes.

569
00:40:00,337 --> 00:40:01,880
- Where is he?
- Video feed room.

570
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:04,842
Where is that? I don't know
where the hell anything is.

571
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:06,593
Where am I?

572
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,345
Where?

573
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,681
What's going on?

574
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:12,307
I don't know.
You tell me.

575
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:18,397
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know.

576
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:20,649
Do you know what he's doing?

577
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:22,693
- I need to know what you know.
- Nothing.

578
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,111
He wanted to go inside.

579
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:26,488
We are inside.
You mean outside?

580
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:29,408
- He said, "inside. "
- What? Inside the spacecraft?

581
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,868
I think inside the Sphere.

582
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:24,754
Holy shit!

583
00:41:25,755 --> 00:41:26,714
My God.

584
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:28,299
Did he go inside?

585
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:31,970
- I don't think so.
- What the hell's going on?

586
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:33,221
He didn't just disappear.

587
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:35,640
I think it's a glitch in the video.

588
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:37,642
Give me playback on that.

589
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,394
You'll have it in a minute.

590
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:41,437
You knew he was doing this
and you said nothing.

591
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,190
- You didn't think!
- I didn't think it possible.

592
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:45,483
Where are Beth and Ted?

593
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:49,696
I don't know. I woke up, I heard
bells ringing and I started running...

594
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:51,906
I'm not getting an image
on the sub.

595
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:54,700
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!

596
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,285
They'll be here in 25 minutes or less!

597
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:59,455
The only logical explanation
is that the sub is still at the surface.

598
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:01,749
Is it also logically possible
your sonar is messed up?!

599
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:03,793
Let's just calm down, all right?

600
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:06,712
He didn't just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.

601
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:10,841
You got that right. I am not going to
lose a civilian on my watch.

602
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:13,177
You have just screwed up
our trip to the surface.

603
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:14,804
We are not going up to the surface.

604
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:16,847
Harry!
We are not going up!

605
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:18,599
Harry!
Can you hear me?

606
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:20,559
Harry, can you hear me?

607
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,938
Norman, this is not a triage situation.

608
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:29,276
Go find me Ted and Beth.

609
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:38,702
Norman, stop.

610
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:58,055
Still no reading on the sub.

611
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,683
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.

612
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:05,104
When Beth and Ted get here, make sure
they don't go anywhere. All right?

613
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:52,192
What the hell?

614
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:53,819
Can you hear me?

615
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,960
Is he alive?

616
00:44:10,418 --> 00:44:13,588
We have a problem.
Harry's out cold. His pulse is normal.

617
00:44:14,047 --> 00:44:16,216
All his vitals are normal...

618
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:18,051
...but I don't get it.

619
00:44:36,402 --> 00:44:38,029
Hello. Hello!

620
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:51,709
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here. Can you hear me?

621
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,506
- That tears it.
- What, sir?

622
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:58,466
We're on internal power.

623
00:44:59,217 --> 00:45:00,093
I don't follow you.

624
00:45:00,593 --> 00:45:04,597
They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.

625
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:06,891
Break out your 5-day deodorant pads.

626
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:08,935
We're here for the duration.

627
00:45:18,444 --> 00:45:19,779
Everything's normal.

628
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:29,121
What's going on?
Is he all right?

629
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:31,957
Is it true? Did he go inside?
What did he say?

630
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:35,419
He didn't say.
He's aphasic.

631
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:37,046
He's asleep, Ted.

632
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:40,174
I can't believe he went inside.
He didn't say anything?

633
00:45:40,508 --> 00:45:42,843
There's no door, no entry.
How did he get in?

634
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,896
Can I have your attention, please?

635
00:45:54,146 --> 00:45:56,023
We've lost contact with the surface.

636
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:59,610
The Habitat is now operating
solely under internal power.

637
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:02,655
We have plenty of food, oxygen
and fresh water...

638
00:46:02,905 --> 00:46:04,865
...to sustain us
until the storm is over...

639
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:07,743
...and we reestablish contact
with the surface.

640
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:11,413
But until that time,
this mission is subject...

641
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:14,041
...to emergency authority
under my command.

642
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:43,987
I'm taking this out
to the mini-sub.

643
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:47,032
- Are you up on the duty roster?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:50,535
Where's she going?

645
00:46:50,827 --> 00:46:54,164
It's procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.

646
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:59,544
Every 12 hours we take the videos to
the mini-sub and press the reset button.

647
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:03,048
The idea is, if something happens to us
and we don't reset it...

648
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:06,051
...the sub goes to the surface
automatically.

649
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:10,347
If we're all dead, they at least have
a partial record of what went wrong.

650
00:47:11,222 --> 00:47:12,807
Cheerful thought, huh?

651
00:47:13,892 --> 00:47:15,393
Mind the store a minute.

652
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:18,146
I'm going to the head.

653
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,939
What the hell's that?

654
00:48:11,616 --> 00:48:13,326
It's so beautiful down here.

655
00:48:13,743 --> 00:48:15,536
It's so tranquil.

656
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:19,540
This is beautiful.

657
00:48:19,749 --> 00:48:22,627
It's hard to believe we have a typhoon
1,000 feet above our heads.

658
00:48:23,628 --> 00:48:25,838
Hey, it's snowing down here.

659
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:28,799
You see them?
There's got to be a million...

660
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:30,468
...jellyfish down here.

661
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:33,596
Man, this is really beautiful.

662
00:48:36,474 --> 00:48:39,351
These jellyfish are getting
a little friendly.

663
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:42,021
Having a hard time seeing.

664
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:47,109
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It's getting thick down here.

665
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,903
Hello, hello.

666
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:53,365
I can't see what I'm doing.

667
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:58,537
They're sticking to my faceplate.

668
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:02,541
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding. Just
swim through them. They're harmless.

669
00:49:04,043 --> 00:49:06,920
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.

670
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:10,132
Fletcher, get out of there.

671
00:49:10,424 --> 00:49:12,176
What are jellyfish doing at 1,000 feet?

672
00:49:12,426 --> 00:49:14,845
I think they feel
the heat from my body.

673
00:49:16,555 --> 00:49:18,182
I can't get them off me!

674
00:49:20,476 --> 00:49:22,519
They're stinging through my suit!

675
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,605
Get back to the Habitat
on the double.

676
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:27,691
I can't move my legs!

677
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,444
Come back to the Habitat.

678
00:49:30,903 --> 00:49:32,696
They're inside my suit!

679
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:35,616
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!

680
00:49:43,874 --> 00:49:45,250
Help me!

681
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:23,663
Jesus, Barnes, she's dead!
There's no bubbles.

682
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:34,090
Edmunds.

683
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:35,091
Yes, sir?

684
00:50:35,592 --> 00:50:37,135
Come on down here.

685
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:38,761
Something...

686
00:50:39,012 --> 00:50:40,555
...happened to Fletcher.

687
00:51:10,084 --> 00:51:11,127
God!

688
00:51:14,005 --> 00:51:16,924
When I was 5 years old
I went out on a boat with my father.

689
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:21,304
He told me not to jump in the water,
so of course I did and...

690
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:26,142
Oh, my!

691
00:51:26,642 --> 00:51:29,186
I jumped right into a school
of these guys.

692
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,063
Not this big, though.

693
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:35,609
I think every one had a shot at me.
I don't know what this lady felt...

694
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,697
...but, man, it went beyond pain.
I've been...

695
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,866
...afraid of them since.

696
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:45,369
Would you feel any better if I told you
this wasn't exactly a jellyfish?

697
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:46,287
You mean...?

698
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:50,166
I mean, jellyfish like this
are unheard of.

699
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:54,044
I don't know what this is,
but it isn't God's creation.

700
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:10,185
Here I am
Your special island

701
00:52:12,146 --> 00:52:13,981
Come to me

702
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,694
Bali Ha'i

703
00:52:30,456 --> 00:52:31,874
You can come in.

704
00:52:36,545 --> 00:52:39,131
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?

705
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:41,717
- No, thanks.
- How well do you know Dr. Halperin?

706
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:45,512
I used to teach at UC San Diego
years ago. She came for her master's.

707
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:49,933
Don't take it personally, but I assume
she wasn't a romantic interest.

708
00:52:50,183 --> 00:52:51,476
Don't take what personally?

709
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:53,729
She's a tall, vibrant,
younger woman.

710
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:54,980
What's your point?

711
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,314
You knew her as a patient.

712
00:52:56,523 --> 00:52:59,067
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.

713
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:02,821
I understand an exotic-gas environment
1,000 feet under water...

714
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:04,448
...with no lifeline to the surface...

715
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,534
...is about the most dangerous
environment on the planet.

716
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,744
If there's a problem,
I got to know about it.

717
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:12,414
- Beth is fine.
- "Beth is fine. "

718
00:53:12,914 --> 00:53:14,291
- Beth's fine.
- She's very fine.

719
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:17,335
Would you like to read this
and tell me what it says?

720
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,671
- Are these my actual notes?
- What does it say?

721
00:53:19,879 --> 00:53:22,591
- How in the world did you get...
- Does it say "suicide attempt"?

722
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:25,635
"Electroshock therapy"?
Isn't that what it says?

723
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:26,720
What's your point?

724
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,264
Didn't it seem important enough
to tell somebody?

725
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,516
You were willing to jeopardize
these people's lives...

726
00:53:31,766 --> 00:53:34,811
...to have someone here
who could be mentally unstable?

727
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,563
Are you aware of the term,
"overreact"?

728
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:38,064
We're 160 fathoms down.

729
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:41,192
And we've got a nutbag down here
who can flip out and crack up.

730
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:43,570
You selected the team.
Why didn't you tell me?

731
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,281
When I wrote this, I didn't know
the team would be 1,000...

732
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:50,618
1,000 or 10, it makes no difference!
Why didn't you tell me about Beth?

733
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:51,911
It wasn't pertinent.

734
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:53,538
That was not your call to make!

735
00:53:53,788 --> 00:53:55,915
Yes, it was and it still is.
It was a passive attempt.

736
00:53:56,165 --> 00:53:57,125
A passive attempt?!

737
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,962
Those who really want to kill themselves
shoot themselves or go over a bridge.

738
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:04,716
They don't call their boyfriend and say,
"I just took 20 Nebutol. Help me. "

739
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,969
She took 20 yellows,
and you're telling me she's perfect.

740
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:09,303
What is it?
Come in.

741
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:12,640
It's Harry.

742
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,016
What?
He's awake?

743
00:54:14,225 --> 00:54:15,184
He's really awake.

744
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:19,147
Man, oh, man!

745
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,024
You're going to have
a problem with me.

746
00:54:22,233 --> 00:54:25,319
If my good buddy Norman keeps cooking
like this, I ain't going nowhere.

747
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,071
This toast is good.

748
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:29,574
Bacon? Better.

749
00:54:29,824 --> 00:54:33,953
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!

750
00:54:34,787 --> 00:54:36,872
Norman, what did you put
in these eggs?

751
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:39,375
No, no, wait.
Don't tell me.

752
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:42,837
Parsley.

753
00:54:43,087 --> 00:54:45,673
Chives.
Tarragon and...

754
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:47,466
What is that?

755
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:49,844
Chervil?
Is that chervil?

756
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:51,220
Yes, it is.

757
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,556
I'm glad you like it, Harry.

758
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:55,516
I love eggs!

759
00:54:57,643 --> 00:54:59,145
They sure seem
to cheer you up.

760
00:54:59,353 --> 00:55:00,938
Do you remember what happened?

761
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:04,441
Yeah. I went inside.

762
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:07,278
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.

763
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:11,240
There are doors all over this place
and we can't get out.

764
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,367
- We're still here.
- Yes, we are.

765
00:55:13,617 --> 00:55:15,327
You didn't answer my question.

766
00:55:17,788 --> 00:55:19,206
Why are you looking
at me like that?

767
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:24,044
Harry, are you saying
we shouldn't still be here?

768
00:55:24,378 --> 00:55:26,839
Where's Teeny?
I thought she did all the cooking.

769
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:30,300
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.

770
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:33,137
Killed? How?

771
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,431
Jellyfish.

772
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:40,602
Jellyfish?

773
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:42,020
That's strange.

774
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:43,856
Yes, it is strange, isn't it?

775
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:45,858
Here you go, Harry.

776
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:50,320
- Little onion rings. Look at that.
- It's not onion rings.

777
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:51,989
Good, though.

778
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:53,657
Guess what it is.

779
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:54,866
Calamari!

780
00:55:59,663 --> 00:56:01,081
You all right?

781
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:04,042
Cough, cough, cough.

782
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:07,379
- No, you're doing it wrong.
- I know what I'm doing.

783
00:56:07,462 --> 00:56:08,505
Bring it up.

784
00:56:09,631 --> 00:56:10,674
Come on, bring it up.

785
00:56:11,216 --> 00:56:13,927
He's trying to say something.
He's trying to talk.

786
00:56:15,595 --> 00:56:17,889
You don't listen.
He wants to say something!

787
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:21,268
- I'm not choking, you asshole!
- See?

788
00:56:21,518 --> 00:56:22,894
I hate squid.

789
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:27,023
I hate squid.

790
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,403
I'm sorry.

791
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:33,238
I was trying to help.

792
00:56:39,202 --> 00:56:40,161
You okay?

793
00:56:42,622 --> 00:56:44,416
Harry, let me ask you something.

794
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:49,254
Before you went in the Sphere,
you were convinced we would die here.

795
00:56:50,713 --> 00:56:52,132
Yeah, I remember that.

796
00:56:54,884 --> 00:56:56,094
You still believe it?

797
00:57:00,014 --> 00:57:02,141
You afraid of dying, Norman?

798
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,000
Bullshit!
He's hiding something and you know it.

799
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:31,170
He went inside the Sphere and whatever
it is he saw, he won't tell us.

800
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,173
- He said he doesn't remember anything.
- You bought that?

801
00:57:35,424 --> 00:57:37,385
The whole food thing
was all a diversion.

802
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:40,721
The guy's willing to put
all of our lives on the line...

803
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:43,099
...because he doesn't want
to share information.

804
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:46,811
I can see it. He's making notes for a
book. He wants to win the Nobel Prize.

805
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:48,312
And you don't?

806
00:57:50,564 --> 00:57:53,317
Norman, you've known me
since I was 17 years old.

807
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:55,611
I would love to be
the guy who gets...

808
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:57,196
Do you know
how respected...

809
00:57:57,446 --> 00:58:02,368
I'm not! I've written one
"Fun With Dick and Jane" book on physics.

810
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:04,120
I mean, Niels Bohr...

811
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,165
...he published "The Quantum Theory
of Atomic Structure" at 28.

812
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:11,961
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.

813
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:15,881
In physics, if you haven't done it
by 35, chances are you never will.

814
00:58:16,131 --> 00:58:19,885
This doesn't have anything to do
with your competitiveness with Harry?

815
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:22,137
19. Wunderkind!

816
00:58:22,388 --> 00:58:23,764
I rest my case.

817
00:58:24,348 --> 00:58:25,933
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.

818
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:26,892
Why?

819
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:29,103
Something's wrong
with the computer system.

820
00:58:38,445 --> 00:58:41,532
- Try purging it.
- I tried. It just keeps coming back.

821
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:43,408
Discharge from the buffer memory?

822
00:58:43,617 --> 00:58:45,494
I ruled that out.

823
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:49,414
The helium is getting to the chips.
It's probably a saturation effect.

824
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:53,001
- If that's true, what are our options?
- You have to change all the chips.

825
00:58:53,252 --> 00:58:56,463
Forget it. Run this place on manual?
It's going to be a long 4 days.

826
00:58:56,797 --> 00:58:58,131
Hey, boss.

827
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:02,427
- Figured that out yet?
- It's a saturation effect.

828
00:59:02,678 --> 00:59:06,765
I don't think so. If it's a saturation
effect, it would be random.

829
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,475
What do you mean?

830
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:10,894
This has a pattern.

831
00:59:18,985 --> 00:59:20,654
See? It's like a code.

832
00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:22,405
A code from where?

833
00:59:24,616 --> 00:59:25,534
How'd you do that?

834
00:59:25,825 --> 00:59:26,701
How'd you see that?

835
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,161
Try binary.

836
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,504
See? Letter breaks.

837
00:59:48,223 --> 00:59:50,183
You think this is coming
from the Sphere?

838
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:51,559
Don't know.

839
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:56,231
This mission is ultra top-secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.

840
00:59:58,024 --> 01:00:00,985
If you were it,
how would you know our alphabet?

841
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:03,488
Same way it's configured on a keyboard.

842
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,200
But reflected in an orb,
spherically.

843
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,994
A keyboard, but spherical.

844
01:00:10,578 --> 01:00:12,038
Take a keyboard...

845
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,665
...wrap it around a sphere...

846
01:00:13,915 --> 01:00:16,709
...then starting at the center key, G,
number the letters...

847
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,836
...spiraling out.

848
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:21,631
- You the man!
- I still got it.

849
01:00:21,964 --> 01:00:23,674
I still got the juice.

850
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:31,390
Keyboard.

851
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,184
They let you keep those?

852
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:35,394
Here, you want them?

853
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,900
All we got to do now
is plug in the numbers.

854
01:01:07,218 --> 01:01:08,385
Friends...

855
01:01:08,844 --> 01:01:13,182
...in the 8,000 years
of recorded history, this is a first.

856
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:17,561
You're now on-line
with an alien intelligence.

857
01:01:18,354 --> 01:01:21,148
You got to be kidding.
You must've messed up the translation.

858
01:01:21,357 --> 01:01:22,358
I don't think so.

859
01:01:22,566 --> 01:01:25,152
If this is right,
this alien sounds like an idiot.

860
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:29,698
That's something to consider.
A stupid alien. They must have them.

861
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:34,411
I will admit the message is childlike,
but actually it's quite perfect.

862
01:01:34,703 --> 01:01:36,955
It's short, to the point,
non-threatening...

863
01:01:37,206 --> 01:01:39,958
...kind of the way you talk
to a small child or a dog.

864
01:01:42,419 --> 01:01:43,796
Look at this.

865
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:47,132
He's making a speech.

866
01:01:58,602 --> 01:02:00,062
Ask him for his last name.

867
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:01,188
What?

868
01:02:01,438 --> 01:02:03,815
I want a full name for my report.

869
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:08,070
I'm not putting in my report I lost
a crew member on a deepsat expedition...

870
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,780
...to find an alien named Jerry.

871
01:02:09,988 --> 01:02:11,031
Please! "Jerry"?

872
01:02:11,281 --> 01:02:13,575
We ought to tell him
that we're enjoying it too.

873
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:15,535
Ask him where he's from.

874
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:19,831
Where are you from?

875
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:29,758
"I make a journey. You make a journey.
We make a journey together. "

876
01:02:30,008 --> 01:02:32,802
I think Jerry's channeling
Deepak Chopra.

877
01:02:33,762 --> 01:02:35,513
A journey from where?

878
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:51,029
He's happy.

879
01:02:51,613 --> 01:02:52,614
He's crafty.

880
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:57,243
What happened?

881
01:02:57,952 --> 01:02:59,704
Damn, I think we lost him.

882
01:03:01,372 --> 01:03:02,832
We're not alone.

883
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:05,543
We are definitely...

884
01:03:05,793 --> 01:03:07,170
...not alone.

885
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,923
It's trying to make contact with us.

886
01:03:10,506 --> 01:03:14,928
Whatever it is, it was inside
that Sphere. Now it's out, free to act.

887
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:16,346
What do you mean by that?

888
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:18,389
Free to take over our computers...

889
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,143
...call us on the phone,
come knock on the door if it wants to.

890
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:24,520
A physical presence.

891
01:03:24,937 --> 01:03:26,272
What are you thinking about?

892
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:28,149
That last part where he said,
"I am happy. "

893
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:30,318
Don't you want Jerry to be happy?

894
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:31,903
Honestly?

895
01:03:32,195 --> 01:03:33,196
What's on your mind?

896
01:03:33,404 --> 01:03:36,532
I would be happy if Jerry
had no emotions whatsoever.

897
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:39,285
Because the thing of it is,
here's Jerry...

898
01:03:39,535 --> 01:03:44,499
...an emotional being, cooped up
for 300 years with no one to talk to...

899
01:03:44,749 --> 01:03:47,418
...none of the socialization,
the emotional growth...

900
01:03:47,668 --> 01:03:50,296
...that comes from contact
with other emotional beings...

901
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:51,923
So?

902
01:03:52,882 --> 01:03:55,343
What happens if Jerry gets mad?

903
01:04:15,529 --> 01:04:16,906
What is that sound?

904
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:18,532
Did you hear it?

905
01:04:19,742 --> 01:04:20,784
You hear that thump?

906
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:22,369
What is that sound?

907
01:04:23,412 --> 01:04:26,415
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?

908
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,168
You are a hell of a woman.

909
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:32,254
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were...

910
01:04:32,504 --> 01:04:34,923
Norman told you what?

911
01:04:36,592 --> 01:04:40,512
Let's put it this way,
that if Jerry could read your mind...

912
01:04:40,763 --> 01:04:42,848
...he'd be bored with ours.

913
01:04:46,018 --> 01:04:47,936
What is that sound?

914
01:04:48,729 --> 01:04:50,147
Can you hear me?

915
01:04:53,317 --> 01:04:54,693
This is Norman.

916
01:04:54,943 --> 01:04:58,906
I get no answer from Edmunds and there's
strange noises. Something's going on.

917
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:14,212
It looks like Edmunds is up
on the side of the Habitat.

918
01:05:16,757 --> 01:05:20,469
I'm not getting anything on sonar,
but watch yourselves out there.

919
01:05:34,816 --> 01:05:36,860
Would you hit
your callback buttons, please?

920
01:05:37,694 --> 01:05:39,362
What'd you tell Barnes?

921
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:41,197
About what?

922
01:05:41,865 --> 01:05:43,116
About me.

923
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:48,246
You told him I took 20 Nebutol
and tried to kill myself.

924
01:05:48,496 --> 01:05:49,456
Didn't you?

925
01:05:49,706 --> 01:05:51,791
He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?

926
01:05:53,877 --> 01:05:56,171
Did you tell him who I called?

927
01:06:03,386 --> 01:06:04,554
Oh, God.

928
01:06:14,689 --> 01:06:15,899
Come in.

929
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:38,254
Did you guys find that thumping yet?

930
01:07:09,535 --> 01:07:12,329
I don't get it.
What could've done this to her?

931
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:19,962
My God!

932
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:24,717
She's like a rag doll.

933
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:28,470
Her body's been completely pulverized.

934
01:07:28,804 --> 01:07:29,889
My God.

935
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,103
"... tentacles 27 feet long.
That would make a formidable monster. "

936
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:43,444
Let's go. Come on.
What?

937
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:47,948
What is that?

938
01:07:51,827 --> 01:07:53,245
What does this mean?

939
01:07:53,954 --> 01:07:55,205
Talk to me.

940
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:57,332
What does this mean, Beth?

941
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:59,626
There's something up there!

942
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:02,754
Guys, I'm getting
a reading on the sonar.

943
01:08:04,339 --> 01:08:05,674
You're not alone out there.

944
01:08:06,008 --> 01:08:09,386
What the hell makes eggs this size?!
Come on! Jesus, let's go!

945
01:08:09,761 --> 01:08:11,054
All right!

946
01:08:15,684 --> 01:08:18,312
Norman, let's go.
Come on. Let's go!

947
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:24,109
What the hell is going on?

948
01:08:26,611 --> 01:08:28,447
It's 80 yards and closing.

949
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:30,157
Get out of there.

950
01:08:32,701 --> 01:08:33,702
What the hell?

951
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:36,913
What the hell is it?!

952
01:08:37,164 --> 01:08:39,666
Come on, Norman!
Come on, let's go!

953
01:08:40,292 --> 01:08:42,085
60 yards.
How close are you?

954
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:46,172
What is it?

955
01:08:47,299 --> 01:08:49,134
What the hell is it?!

956
01:08:49,676 --> 01:08:51,469
40 yards. Move, move!

957
01:08:52,637 --> 01:08:55,015
Come on. It's something big!
Let's go!

958
01:08:55,807 --> 01:08:58,184
Where is it?
What is it?

959
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,353
20 yards! Move!

960
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,803
I need a report.

961
01:09:34,053 --> 01:09:37,181
I don't know what's going on out there.
There are eggs everywhere.

962
01:09:37,432 --> 01:09:39,100
You should've brought one back.

963
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,645
I wasn't up for an Easter egg hunt.
Maybe that's what Edmunds was doing.

964
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,314
I want to talk to Jerry.

965
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:55,324
If we're going to talk to this thing,
we got to have a game plan.

966
01:09:55,575 --> 01:09:56,784
Specific.

967
01:09:56,993 --> 01:10:00,037
We have to have an objective.
We have to know what we're addressing.

968
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,084
Jesus.

969
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:14,969
Can you hear me?

970
01:10:17,722 --> 01:10:20,015
You've heard everything
we've talked about.

971
01:10:21,308 --> 01:10:22,560
That's great.

972
01:10:25,104 --> 01:10:26,230
This is Ted here.

973
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:31,068
I'm the guy who decoded
the keyboard thing that you...

974
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:32,945
Shut up!

975
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,447
Tell him we need to discuss this alone.

976
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:39,451
Use your words.

977
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:42,413
He's mad.

978
01:10:42,746 --> 01:10:45,207
- Use your words.
- Let's just pull the plug.

979
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:46,792
It may not be that simple.

980
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:49,795
It's that easy. We leave him alone,
he leaves us alone.

981
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,214
Maybe he doesn't want to be left alone.

982
01:10:52,464 --> 01:10:57,720
He's been down here in isolation
for 300 years. Maybe Jerry's lonely.

983
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:04,518
What's that?

984
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:08,897
It's our sonar picking up
something outside.

985
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:14,444
Jerry, we all think
that you're a fascinating...

986
01:11:14,695 --> 01:11:15,737
...and wonderful entity...

987
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:19,825
...and wish to talk to you for hours.
You know that, don't you?

988
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,870
In your great understanding
and wisdom...

989
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:27,040
...you must know that
entities such as ourselves...

990
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:31,169
...need to be private.
We have to talk alone sometime.

991
01:11:34,297 --> 01:11:35,632
You know what it is?

992
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:41,888
Where'd he go?

993
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:43,265
Shit!

994
01:11:46,309 --> 01:11:49,020
Something's clogging everything up
out there.

995
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:58,363
It's back.

996
01:12:00,073 --> 01:12:02,367
Positive thermals
on the in-line perimeter.

997
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:06,788
What's that?

998
01:12:07,706 --> 01:12:09,249
Something is hitting the sensor grid.

999
01:12:09,749 --> 01:12:10,834
Do we have any defenses?

1000
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:14,421
We can run a high-voltage current
on the skin of the Habitat.

1001
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:16,881
But every time we try it,
we start an electrical fire.

1002
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:20,802
Peripheral sensor's activated. I'll try
to image it on the fast-acting sonar.

1003
01:12:21,553 --> 01:12:22,512
Building an image.

1004
01:12:23,054 --> 01:12:24,806
80 yards, closing fast.

1005
01:12:25,598 --> 01:12:27,600
Jesus Christ, it's 40 feet long.

1006
01:12:28,017 --> 01:12:29,018
50 yards.

1007
01:12:29,227 --> 01:12:30,353
Re-imaging.

1008
01:12:30,562 --> 01:12:33,273
That's the same image I saw
when you were looking for Edmunds.

1009
01:12:33,523 --> 01:12:35,316
It looks like a giant squid.

1010
01:12:35,608 --> 01:12:38,736
A squid the size of the entire Habitat?
There's no such animal.

1011
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:41,197
That may be,
but that doesn't mean it isn't here.

1012
01:12:42,281 --> 01:12:44,450
Re-imaging. 30 yards.

1013
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:48,329
What the hell is going on?

1014
01:12:54,335 --> 01:12:57,547
Jerry, if you can hear me,
it's Norman.

1015
01:12:57,797 --> 01:12:59,924
If we've made you angry...

1016
01:13:00,216 --> 01:13:01,342
We got a pressure drop.

1017
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:03,052
Go to the control room and wait for me!

1018
01:13:03,302 --> 01:13:04,929
Just go, please!

1019
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:06,764
Go! I'll tell you!

1020
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,142
What's that sound?
What is that?

1021
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:11,686
It sounds like it's right above us.

1022
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:14,480
I know where it is,
but what is it?

1023
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:50,432
I'm in the control shaft!
We got a leak in here!

1024
01:13:50,849 --> 01:13:52,309
Hello?!

1025
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:05,697
Holy shit!

1026
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:07,491
Do you hear me?

1027
01:14:08,617 --> 01:14:12,496
You got to increase the positive
air pressure and drive the water out.

1028
01:14:12,788 --> 01:14:16,041
Increase the pressure?
Won't that use up our air supply?

1029
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:19,378
If the Habitat is full of water,
you'll be dead.

1030
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:21,338
Open the red gate valve.

1031
01:14:23,799 --> 01:14:26,843
The pressure is dropping!
We'll be crushed like a tin can!

1032
01:14:27,219 --> 01:14:30,263
Find the red knob!
It's the only one in the room!

1033
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:31,890
Got it!

1034
01:14:35,852 --> 01:14:36,937
Good.

1035
01:14:37,521 --> 01:14:39,231
We're getting positive pressure.

1036
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:43,360
Not too much.

1037
01:14:43,568 --> 01:14:45,112
Start to ease it back.

1038
01:14:57,707 --> 01:14:59,042
Turn it back!

1039
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:01,419
The pressure is too high!

1040
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:03,630
We'll explode!
Can you hear me?

1041
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:06,716
Turn it back!

1042
01:15:18,645 --> 01:15:19,854
We're here!

1043
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:20,897
Jesus!

1044
01:15:21,106 --> 01:15:22,065
Can you hear me?

1045
01:15:22,273 --> 01:15:23,566
I got him!

1046
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,028
Turn the red gate valve.

1047
01:15:27,237 --> 01:15:28,196
Which way?

1048
01:15:28,446 --> 01:15:29,572
Clockwise.
Close it.

1049
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:37,455
Done!

1050
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,709
We're still leaking!

1051
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,337
It's not the shell.
It's the internal pipes.

1052
01:15:44,587 --> 01:15:45,672
We're okay.

1053
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:51,719
What the hell is out there?!

1054
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:57,475
Listen to me.

1055
01:15:57,725 --> 01:15:59,352
Whatever it is,
it's not letting go.

1056
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:02,563
Pull the green lever marked
"high-voltage defense system. "

1057
01:16:02,855 --> 01:16:05,733
He said it would start a fire!
Don't do it!

1058
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:07,568
You said it would start a fire!

1059
01:16:07,777 --> 01:16:10,112
We're going to die down here.
Pull it.

1060
01:16:10,488 --> 01:16:11,781
Barnes, do you hear her?

1061
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:14,367
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.
Pull the green lever.

1062
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:21,040
Pull the lever!

1063
01:16:21,332 --> 01:16:23,918
He's trying to pull something!
Don't do it!

1064
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:25,252
Do you hear her?!

1065
01:16:25,503 --> 01:16:27,755
Don't listen to her.
Pull the goddamn lever!

1066
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:30,049
Don't do it.
If we start a fire...

1067
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,010
...it'll eat up all of our oxygen!

1068
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,804
Don't do it!

1069
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:44,271
We've got failures all over the place!
We're taking on water!

1070
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:46,565
It'll set a fire!
There's no way out!

1071
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:48,651
Shut up!
What am I going to do?!

1072
01:16:49,568 --> 01:16:51,445
You're going to be squid food!
Pull it!

1073
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:54,114
What am I going to do?
We're falling apart!

1074
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:11,715
We're okay.

1075
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:15,177
You don't have to be right all the time.

1076
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,098
Anybody got some Advil?

1077
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:24,019
We got a fire in the comm room.

1078
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:27,272
Get up there. I'll meet you
with gas masks, in case we need them.

1079
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:44,164
Extinguishers?!

1080
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:45,707
There's one there.

1081
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:46,917
I got it!

1082
01:17:47,834 --> 01:17:50,253
- How do you work it?
- Pull the pin.

1083
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:57,010
Are there any more?

1084
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:58,261
In the dorm.

1085
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,606
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1086
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:13,068
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors secured.

1087
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:17,197
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1088
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:26,956
Wake up!

1089
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:28,625
What are you doing?

1090
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,460
Harry, wake up!

1091
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:32,086
Shit!

1092
01:18:58,654 --> 01:19:01,657
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1093
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:06,078
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1094
01:19:06,412 --> 01:19:07,622
Doors secured.

1095
01:19:09,248 --> 01:19:13,961
It's coming through the ceiling panels.
Try to get it through the cafeteria!

1096
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:16,923
Okay, I'm going up.
Get back!

1097
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,646
Don't, Jerry!
Don't.

1098
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:47,119
You okay?

1099
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:48,245
Hang on!

1100
01:19:54,251 --> 01:19:55,502
Get out!

1101
01:20:11,643 --> 01:20:12,853
Get out!

1102
01:21:13,663 --> 01:21:15,665
This is Norman, Jerry.
Can you hear me?

1103
01:21:18,376 --> 01:21:21,087
It's Norman.
Is that you, Jerry?

1104
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:23,673
Who put out the fire?

1105
01:21:25,008 --> 01:21:26,926
Who put the fire out?

1106
01:21:33,475 --> 01:21:36,352
He's dead. Barnes is dead.
He got cut in half by the door.

1107
01:21:36,603 --> 01:21:38,521
Beth and I put him
in a body bag.

1108
01:21:41,441 --> 01:21:43,776
I know. Something
happened to Ted, Jerry.

1109
01:21:46,404 --> 01:21:47,614
I can't.

1110
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:52,660
It's not in my power.

1111
01:21:54,829 --> 01:21:56,623
There was a fire and...

1112
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:01,711
And I froze.

1113
01:22:03,796 --> 01:22:05,339
I didn't help him.

1114
01:22:07,341 --> 01:22:09,802
I wanted to,
but I didn't help him.

1115
01:22:14,432 --> 01:22:17,810
I knew him since he was 17 years old,
and I let him go.

1116
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,771
But I'd like to just deal with this
at a later time.

1117
01:22:27,111 --> 01:22:28,696
You made that, Jerry?

1118
01:22:36,871 --> 01:22:38,289
No, that's all right.

1119
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:42,543
Very important.
Nothing more right now. Please.

1120
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,337
You have to stop.

1121
01:22:45,629 --> 01:22:46,881
Listen to me.

1122
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:49,258
This is critical.

1123
01:22:54,763 --> 01:22:57,641
Your manifestations injure our entities.

1124
01:22:57,975 --> 01:23:01,312
And pretty soon there'll be
no more entities left to play with...

1125
01:23:01,562 --> 01:23:04,106
...and you'll be all alone again...

1126
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,650
...because you can't control yourself.

1127
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:11,780
Because with all your power, you
don't have the power to stop, do you?

1128
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:21,373
What name do you want?

1129
01:23:24,126 --> 01:23:25,711
What name do you want?

1130
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:55,323
Hi, Harry.
How you doing?

1131
01:23:58,034 --> 01:23:59,286
Can you believe what happened?

1132
01:23:59,536 --> 01:24:00,495
What?

1133
01:24:00,746 --> 01:24:03,165
You know, the attack on the Habitat.

1134
01:24:05,459 --> 01:24:07,836
You know there was an attack
on this place?

1135
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:11,298
I must've slept through it.

1136
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:14,801
- You slept through it.
- I was dead tired.

1137
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:19,931
Smoke didn't bother you?

1138
01:24:20,974 --> 01:24:22,517
All the leaking?

1139
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:26,438
You ever read this book,
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea?

1140
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:30,358
I found it in the john.
Someone's misguided attempt at levity.

1141
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:32,944
I always loved this book.

1142
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:35,989
Could never get past page 87 though.
Too scary.

1143
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:38,825
You seem strangely detached,
given our predicament.

1144
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:40,827
I don't know, Norman.

1145
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:44,414
With all your running around,
what have you accomplished?

1146
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:46,833
You knew I was running around?

1147
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,504
Have you seen Beth?

1148
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,631
No. Thought she's
with the others.

1149
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:56,968
What others?
Barnes and Ted are dead, Harry.

1150
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:01,723
There's nobody left down here
that knows how to run the place.

1151
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:03,141
Right?

1152
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:06,102
The fire screwed up the electronics.

1153
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:08,604
We've used up...

1154
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,149
...most of our reserve gas.

1155
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:14,360
You're reading your book.

1156
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:21,492
Somebody has to go reset the mini-sub.

1157
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:24,829
If you don't reset it every 12 hours,
it'll float to the surface.

1158
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:26,664
I'll go.

1159
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:29,542
- I'll go.
- You sure?

1160
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:32,587
If the storm clears...

1161
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,839
...it might be our only way out.

1162
01:25:35,089 --> 01:25:37,008
Can I talk to you for a second?

1163
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:41,053
I don't want Harry anywhere near
that mini-sub.

1164
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,513
Think he'll leave without us?

1165
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:46,308
I think he already left without us.
Harry's in a whole other place.

1166
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:51,105
He slept through the attack.
You don't find that a little strange?

1167
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,650
I guess it's just you and me, babe.

1168
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:57,444
You and me?

1169
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,157
I'll keep my eye on you
from the control room.

1170
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,561
Reset.

1171
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:33,188
Reset, where are you?

1172
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,065
There you are.

1173
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,213
Are there supposed to be bubbles...

1174
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,090
...coming out of...

1175
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,676
...out of here too?

1176
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,516
I think I have bubbles coming out
of my hose or something.

1177
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:16,773
Can you tell me what to do?
It's fogging me all up here.

1178
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,819
There's something wrong here!

1179
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:23,989
I got to get out of here!
Tell me what to do! What do I push?

1180
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,615
Where the hell are you?

1181
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:26,992
Help me.

1182
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:34,541
I don't think I'll ever get back!

1183
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:41,965
Tell me what to do!

1184
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,135
I can't breathe!

1185
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,303
Watch out for that rock.

1186
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:51,099
It's me, Harry.
Come around the rock.

1187
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:53,560
Go to the right of the stanchion.

1188
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:55,770
Tell me what to do.
I'm hurting.

1189
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,106
Come around which way?

1190
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,441
I can't breathe!

1191
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,318
Yes, you can breathe.

1192
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:05,989
It's just a faulty valve.
It won't kill you. You got plenty of gas.

1193
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,657
I can't tell which way I'm going!

1194
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:10,368
See the air lock?
Right in front of you.

1195
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:14,122
I can't bear the feeling in my ears!

1196
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:15,915
And I can't breathe.

1197
01:28:40,564 --> 01:28:42,275
- Where is she?
- Slow your breathing.

1198
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:45,861
- You'll hyperventilate.
- She said she'd keep an eye out for me.

1199
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:49,281
I looked all over the Habitat for her.
I thought she was with you.

1200
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:53,369
Where is she?

1201
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:55,037
Where is she?!

1202
01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:07,007
Did she tell you she was going out?

1203
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:11,512
I can't hear you.

1204
01:29:11,762 --> 01:29:13,305
If she can't hear,
why'd she answer?

1205
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:14,682
What are you doing?

1206
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:17,393
I went looking for food.
We're out of food.

1207
01:29:18,143 --> 01:29:21,438
I was just up there. Stuff all over,
but there's plenty of food.

1208
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:25,109
You went to look for food in the
spacecraft. That seems a little odd.

1209
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:26,985
No. What seems odd about it?

1210
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:30,823
Even if there was food,
wouldn't it be at least 300 years old?

1211
01:29:31,156 --> 01:29:33,700
I was hoping for a cryogenic freezer,
you know?

1212
01:29:34,034 --> 01:29:35,911
Maybe a bottle of Bordeaux.

1213
01:29:36,495 --> 01:29:38,956
She's lying.
She's lying about everything.

1214
01:29:39,581 --> 01:29:41,416
Is Harry up there with you?

1215
01:29:46,088 --> 01:29:49,508
Why don't we talk when you get back.
Meet me in the galley.

1216
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:53,178
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
There's still coffee, isn't there?

1217
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:57,391
Very funny. I'll take mine black,
like my mood.

1218
01:29:57,641 --> 01:29:59,351
All right. See you soon.

1219
01:30:01,269 --> 01:30:05,357
We got 2 ingredients here:
Beth and this underwater environment.

1220
01:30:05,607 --> 01:30:08,860
Put them together,
you got one big-ass bomb.

1221
01:30:18,578 --> 01:30:20,288
How did it go in the mini-sub?

1222
01:30:20,747 --> 01:30:22,791
It was a little disconcerting
out there, actually.

1223
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:26,753
Weren't you supposed to be watching out
for me from the control room?

1224
01:30:26,962 --> 01:30:28,380
Yeah, but...

1225
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:32,717
...Harry said he'd take over for me.
You sat down at the monitors.

1226
01:30:35,345 --> 01:30:36,388
What happened?

1227
01:30:37,555 --> 01:30:38,848
I was in trouble.

1228
01:30:39,099 --> 01:30:40,100
Where were you?

1229
01:30:43,103 --> 01:30:45,438
- What's going on?
- "What's going on?"

1230
01:30:45,855 --> 01:30:48,983
Going out to look for 300-year-old food
in that spaceship...

1231
01:30:49,234 --> 01:30:52,237
...when there's plenty of food here
isn't exactly normal.

1232
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:53,822
"Plenty of food"?

1233
01:30:54,072 --> 01:30:55,865
There isn't any...

1234
01:31:02,205 --> 01:31:03,831
A veritable horn of plenty.

1235
01:31:16,427 --> 01:31:17,428
He must have hidden it.

1236
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:19,597
You think I hid all that food?

1237
01:31:20,306 --> 01:31:21,682
I don't know what's going on.

1238
01:31:24,852 --> 01:31:26,229
I was standing right here.

1239
01:31:26,813 --> 01:31:28,981
And there was no food
in the cupboards.

1240
01:31:31,984 --> 01:31:33,903
And there was no food
in the fridge.

1241
01:31:34,153 --> 01:31:35,112
Why?

1242
01:31:35,363 --> 01:31:38,032
Why would Harry do that?
Why would he set you up?

1243
01:31:38,366 --> 01:31:39,992
I don't know.

1244
01:31:41,827 --> 01:31:42,870
You don't know?

1245
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,455
I'm telling you...

1246
01:31:44,705 --> 01:31:46,540
...I was standing here...

1247
01:31:46,874 --> 01:31:48,709
...and this food was not here!

1248
01:31:49,001 --> 01:31:52,672
Calling Dr. Halperin. Dr. Beth
Halperin. Please return to reality.

1249
01:31:53,047 --> 01:31:54,423
Shut up.

1250
01:31:54,757 --> 01:31:56,550
You can see what he's doing to me.

1251
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:58,677
You said you'd watch me.
You didn't.

1252
01:31:58,928 --> 01:32:00,721
You think Harry
said something he didn't...

1253
01:32:00,971 --> 01:32:02,681
...that cupboards are empty
when they're full.

1254
01:32:02,932 --> 01:32:06,644
Clinically, we would call that
evidence of a psychotic break.

1255
01:32:07,019 --> 01:32:08,562
I am not crazy, Norman!

1256
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,482
You going to write me a prescription?

1257
01:32:11,732 --> 01:32:15,903
And just get rid of me again?
It's not that convenient down here!

1258
01:32:16,153 --> 01:32:17,404
I am not psychotic!

1259
01:32:17,696 --> 01:32:19,031
How about a mini-psychotic break?

1260
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,366
That's not fair.

1261
01:32:20,574 --> 01:32:21,408
What?!

1262
01:32:21,617 --> 01:32:25,913
I'm down there. I can't breathe.
I'm hyperventilating. The man saved me.

1263
01:32:26,413 --> 01:32:27,498
Wait a minute!

1264
01:32:27,748 --> 01:32:30,209
You want me to believe
that he set you up! Why?

1265
01:32:30,584 --> 01:32:32,419
This isn't Alice In Wonderland!

1266
01:32:32,628 --> 01:32:34,546
Remember, " just you and me, babe"?

1267
01:32:35,464 --> 01:32:37,883
Is it unrealistic to think
that at this point...

1268
01:32:38,133 --> 01:32:41,178
...you are a danger to yourself,
to all of us...

1269
01:32:41,553 --> 01:32:45,849
...because of your anger toward me,
which happened 10 or 15 years ago...

1270
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:47,810
...which is so distorted
in your head!

1271
01:32:48,602 --> 01:32:49,645
I was out there.

1272
01:32:49,853 --> 01:32:51,605
You almost got me killed!

1273
01:32:51,897 --> 01:32:55,567
The man tried to save my life!
You now want me to disbelieve Harry?!

1274
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:59,029
Yes, I want you to disbelieve Harry!
I want you...

1275
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:01,949
...to look at me
and believe for one time.

1276
01:33:04,368 --> 01:33:06,203
Look at me.
Am I telling you the truth?

1277
01:33:06,411 --> 01:33:07,579
You weren't there.

1278
01:33:09,122 --> 01:33:13,126
You want to believe Harry,
then that's fine.

1279
01:33:13,627 --> 01:33:17,130
Because he's done everything but part
the sea for you since we've been here.

1280
01:33:18,924 --> 01:33:20,717
But I'm telling you...

1281
01:33:21,092 --> 01:33:22,636
...that he is not...

1282
01:33:22,886 --> 01:33:25,013
...telling you the truth.

1283
01:33:25,388 --> 01:33:26,598
This is not about Harry.

1284
01:33:27,933 --> 01:33:28,975
Is it?

1285
01:33:30,435 --> 01:33:31,937
Who's this about?

1286
01:33:34,147 --> 01:33:37,067
He didn't tell you what's
inside the Sphere, did he?

1287
01:33:38,234 --> 01:33:41,863
You didn't tell him
what's inside the Sphere.

1288
01:33:43,156 --> 01:33:45,325
And how would you know that?

1289
01:33:51,206 --> 01:33:52,290
Did you go inside?

1290
01:33:56,669 --> 01:33:59,005
Answer me.
Did you go inside the Sphere?

1291
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:05,386
Why won't you answer me?

1292
01:34:09,182 --> 01:34:10,266
It's a question.

1293
01:34:10,516 --> 01:34:12,393
You don't want to talk to me.

1294
01:34:12,644 --> 01:34:13,853
Remember?

1295
01:34:15,229 --> 01:34:16,689
Answer a question.

1296
01:34:21,694 --> 01:34:23,154
What do you think?

1297
01:34:24,822 --> 01:34:26,866
You think she went in the Sphere?

1298
01:34:38,711 --> 01:34:39,879
Here.

1299
01:34:40,254 --> 01:34:41,964
You dropped your book.

1300
01:36:16,558 --> 01:36:18,185
What isn't Harry telling me?

1301
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:21,271
I know you're there.
You're always there.

1302
01:36:23,148 --> 01:36:25,108
What's inside the Sphere?

1303
01:36:26,485 --> 01:36:28,904
Harry is reading this book...

1304
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:31,573
...Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea.

1305
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,951
What makes me nervous
is that after page...

1306
01:36:35,202 --> 01:36:36,870
...87...

1307
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:43,668
...it's all blank pages.

1308
01:36:47,922 --> 01:36:49,090
Why?

1309
01:36:51,343 --> 01:36:53,553
Why did he go into the Sphere...

1310
01:36:57,015 --> 01:36:58,892
...and come out like this?
Why?

1311
01:36:59,267 --> 01:37:00,727
Why?
Why, Jerry?

1312
01:37:01,019 --> 01:37:03,062
Why is this book half a book, Jerry?

1313
01:37:04,063 --> 01:37:05,273
Why? Why?

1314
01:37:05,607 --> 01:37:07,192
What's going on?

1315
01:37:12,697 --> 01:37:15,283
He's got G equals one.

1316
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:17,368
That's right.

1317
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:21,080
He's got B equals two.

1318
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:24,834
He's got...

1319
01:37:25,043 --> 01:37:27,086
...H equals three.

1320
01:37:28,087 --> 01:37:29,380
That's not right.

1321
01:37:29,881 --> 01:37:31,924
Harry's got the code wrong.

1322
01:37:32,175 --> 01:37:34,469
H doesn't equal three.

1323
01:38:55,299 --> 01:38:58,677
Harry not only makes it real
for himself, Beth.

1324
01:38:58,927 --> 01:39:01,388
He makes it real for you.
He makes it real for me.

1325
01:39:01,638 --> 01:39:04,016
He has made it real for everybody.

1326
01:39:04,308 --> 01:39:08,520
It's really frightening because you
don't know whether it's really real...

1327
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:13,317
...or whether he's made it real
for us to believe it's real.

1328
01:39:14,401 --> 01:39:16,403
And it's because of the Sphere.

1329
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,700
Our Harry is Jerry?

1330
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:24,703
Come on, I'm just as tired
as you are.

1331
01:39:25,328 --> 01:39:27,247
I know you can get this.
Okay?

1332
01:39:29,332 --> 01:39:34,337
Harry said he couldn't get past page 87
because he said it was too scary.

1333
01:39:34,713 --> 01:39:36,798
There's nothing on the pages.
Where's the rest?

1334
01:39:37,215 --> 01:39:38,884
Read what's on page 87.

1335
01:39:40,343 --> 01:39:42,512
"According to calculations
of some naturalists...

1336
01:39:42,762 --> 01:39:47,100
...one of these animals, only 6 feet
long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.

1337
01:39:47,809 --> 01:39:49,894
That would make a formidable monster. "

1338
01:39:50,645 --> 01:39:52,230
What does Harry hate?

1339
01:39:52,772 --> 01:39:54,190
Squid.

1340
01:39:54,566 --> 01:39:56,609
And when he read that,
it scared him.

1341
01:39:57,444 --> 01:39:58,862
Getting the picture?

1342
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:00,989
Remember all those...

1343
01:40:01,239 --> 01:40:02,991
...jellyfish that attacked?

1344
01:40:03,241 --> 01:40:05,034
What was Harry doing then?

1345
01:40:05,535 --> 01:40:06,494
Sleeping.

1346
01:40:06,703 --> 01:40:08,204
He was dreaming.

1347
01:40:09,664 --> 01:40:12,208
And this is the really wild part:

1348
01:40:12,876 --> 01:40:13,835
What he dreamed...

1349
01:40:14,085 --> 01:40:15,003
Happened?

1350
01:40:15,295 --> 01:40:16,838
It happened.

1351
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:19,924
You're telling me that...

1352
01:40:20,174 --> 01:40:24,554
...because Harry went inside the Sphere,
he now has the power to manifest...

1353
01:40:24,804 --> 01:40:27,557
...his dreams, his fantasies...

1354
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:29,726
Manifest.
He manifested it.

1355
01:40:29,976 --> 01:40:31,227
He made it happen.

1356
01:40:31,477 --> 01:40:32,895
We better not piss him off.

1357
01:40:33,104 --> 01:40:35,773
It's not that different
from a child, right?

1358
01:40:36,107 --> 01:40:39,694
A child imagines that
what it's imagining happens.

1359
01:40:39,944 --> 01:40:41,070
But it doesn't.

1360
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,072
But with Harry, it does.

1361
01:40:43,322 --> 01:40:46,784
In fact, it's so real, it's not only
real to Harry, it's real to all of us.

1362
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:50,079
And what I can't understand is that
ever since he went in the Sphere...

1363
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:51,914
...the Sphere has a power...

1364
01:40:52,165 --> 01:40:55,835
...that projects every subconscious
thought Harry has onto the computer.

1365
01:40:56,168 --> 01:40:58,588
It prints it out
and we interact with it.

1366
01:40:58,838 --> 01:41:02,008
We thought it was Jerry.
It's not Jerry. It's Harry.

1367
01:41:02,341 --> 01:41:03,551
Harry's Jerry.

1368
01:41:03,801 --> 01:41:05,344
Does Harry know this?

1369
01:41:05,594 --> 01:41:08,264
But you went in the Sphere
and nothing happened.

1370
01:41:08,597 --> 01:41:10,725
Obviously, I didn't go in the Sphere.

1371
01:41:10,975 --> 01:41:15,271
You never went inside the Sphere?
You didn't go in there?

1372
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,858
I was so angry at you.

1373
01:41:20,109 --> 01:41:22,194
I wanted you to be scared.

1374
01:41:23,237 --> 01:41:24,655
Maybe you had a right to be.

1375
01:41:25,281 --> 01:41:26,615
Thanks.

1376
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:29,618
You sure you didn't go in there?

1377
01:41:32,246 --> 01:41:35,249
I don't know about you,
but I don't feel like dying down here.

1378
01:41:35,624 --> 01:41:37,918
What we're going to do
is find something to put Harry under.

1379
01:41:38,168 --> 01:41:41,297
We can put him in some
kind of deep unconscious sleep.

1380
01:41:41,547 --> 01:41:42,965
Dreamless sleep, I hope.

1381
01:41:43,215 --> 01:41:45,050
A dreamless sleep, yes.

1382
01:41:45,301 --> 01:41:46,802
How do we do that?

1383
01:41:47,052 --> 01:41:48,804
I got a bunch of drugs up there.

1384
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,806
Fancy that.

1385
01:41:51,056 --> 01:41:52,599
- "Diphenylpyraline. "
- Burns.

1386
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:55,227
- "Ephedrine hydrochloride. "
- Motion sickness.

1387
01:41:55,477 --> 01:41:57,062
"Valdomet"?

1388
01:41:57,312 --> 01:41:59,857
- Ulcers. You might want to keep that.
- "Sintag. "

1389
01:42:00,107 --> 01:42:03,527
Sintag is a synthetic opiate.
It's a painkiller.

1390
01:42:03,777 --> 01:42:05,237
I might want to keep that.

1391
01:42:05,487 --> 01:42:07,948
- What about "parasolutrine"?
- Really?

1392
01:42:08,198 --> 01:42:11,034
I got paracin trichloride.
That's an anesthetic.

1393
01:42:11,285 --> 01:42:12,452
Do you combine it?

1394
01:42:12,703 --> 01:42:15,455
You give about 20 cc's of this one,
6 of this one.

1395
01:42:15,706 --> 01:42:16,623
You're in business.

1396
01:42:16,873 --> 01:42:18,458
Here's some more paracin trichloride.

1397
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:21,586
Good. We'll knock him out
for about 3 to 6 hours.

1398
01:42:34,182 --> 01:42:36,059
I'm going to hold him.

1399
01:42:44,901 --> 01:42:45,861
What's going on?

1400
01:42:46,111 --> 01:42:47,362
Go back to sleep.

1401
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:55,704
I didn't know
it would be that fast-acting.

1402
01:42:57,038 --> 01:42:58,581
We didn't kill him, did we?

1403
01:42:58,832 --> 01:43:00,375
I don't think so.

1404
01:43:03,211 --> 01:43:04,295
Okay.

1405
01:43:12,554 --> 01:43:14,514
Come on, come on.

1406
01:43:19,978 --> 01:43:21,062
Here we go.

1407
01:43:25,775 --> 01:43:26,859
It's a code.

1408
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:34,450
How the hell are we supposed...

1409
01:43:34,701 --> 01:43:36,244
It's decoding itself.

1410
01:43:38,246 --> 01:43:41,749
"Weather normal.
Surface support vessels return. "

1411
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,711
6 hours and counting,
we're out of here.

1412
01:43:46,254 --> 01:43:47,588
It's over.

1413
01:43:53,594 --> 01:43:55,263
If you trust it.

1414
01:43:56,597 --> 01:43:58,933
You know me,
I believe everything.

1415
01:45:19,763 --> 01:45:20,847
Get out!

1416
01:45:21,306 --> 01:45:22,641
Get off!

1417
01:45:47,791 --> 01:45:49,501
They're Belcher sea snakes, Norman.

1418
01:45:49,751 --> 01:45:51,461
The most poisonous snakes in the world.

1419
01:45:52,337 --> 01:45:54,839
But they're nocturnal.
They're only dangerous at night.

1420
01:46:06,726 --> 01:46:09,270
Norman, can you meet me
at the lab, please?

1421
01:46:09,521 --> 01:46:11,981
I have something
I need to show you.

1422
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:34,921
What are you doing?
I'm here.

1423
01:46:37,048 --> 01:46:38,091
What are you doing?

1424
01:46:47,016 --> 01:46:48,476
Why are you locking me in?

1425
01:47:00,571 --> 01:47:02,406
You manifested the snakes.

1426
01:47:03,491 --> 01:47:05,034
Norman, up here.

1427
01:47:05,368 --> 01:47:08,579
You're the only one
who could be manifesting these snakes.

1428
01:47:08,913 --> 01:47:12,708
Turn around.
Turn around and look on the table.

1429
01:47:16,879 --> 01:47:18,881
- See the hypodermic needle?
- Yeah.

1430
01:47:19,173 --> 01:47:21,175
I want you to inject yourself.

1431
01:47:22,885 --> 01:47:24,095
It's the same thing...

1432
01:47:24,303 --> 01:47:25,805
...that we used to inject Harry.

1433
01:47:26,013 --> 01:47:30,393
We gave Harry this stuff because
he was manifesting and we wanted to...

1434
01:47:30,768 --> 01:47:33,145
You're manifesting your fears...

1435
01:47:33,646 --> 01:47:34,814
...the jellyfish...

1436
01:47:35,064 --> 01:47:36,607
...now the snakes.

1437
01:47:36,857 --> 01:47:39,235
The squid thing was Harry,
but he's asleep.

1438
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:43,989
He's in a dreamless sleep. It couldn't
be him. You are the only one left.

1439
01:47:44,406 --> 01:47:48,285
What would the snakes have to do
with me? I didn't go in the Sphere.

1440
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:50,412
See the jars?

1441
01:47:50,663 --> 01:47:54,917
I put the snakes in there and they
disappeared in front of my eyes.

1442
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:57,503
Who's manifesting them, Norman?

1443
01:47:58,003 --> 01:47:58,962
You are.

1444
01:47:59,254 --> 01:48:00,839
I don't have anything
to do with snakes.

1445
01:48:01,048 --> 01:48:05,052
If you don't use the hypodermic needle,
I'm going to have to defend myself.

1446
01:48:05,427 --> 01:48:07,221
I'd remember
if I went in the Sphere!

1447
01:48:07,429 --> 01:48:10,349
Don't make me do this.
I don't want to do this.

1448
01:48:10,641 --> 01:48:11,850
I didn't manifest anything.

1449
01:48:12,059 --> 01:48:15,312
I didn't manifest the squid.
I didn't manifest the...

1450
01:48:15,562 --> 01:48:17,231
I shouldn't be
talking to you like this.

1451
01:48:19,274 --> 01:48:22,027
Why are you taking the gas out
of the room? That's my air.

1452
01:48:33,205 --> 01:48:35,123
What's with this water?!

1453
01:48:35,457 --> 01:48:38,919
Think it through. Whose childhood fears
were the jellyfish?

1454
01:48:39,252 --> 01:48:40,712
- Jellyfish?
- Remember, Norman?

1455
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:43,006
I'm not the only one
who's afraid of jellyfish.

1456
01:48:43,215 --> 01:48:44,841
This wasn't exactly a jellyfish.

1457
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:46,551
Jellyfish like this are unheard of.

1458
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,136
Anybody can be...

1459
01:48:49,387 --> 01:48:52,182
...afraid of jellyfish.
A lot of people are afraid of them.

1460
01:48:52,682 --> 01:48:56,269
Isn't it possible
that you went inside the Sphere...

1461
01:48:56,978 --> 01:48:58,772
...and you just don't remember?

1462
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:02,067
I didn't go inside the Sphere!
You would've seen it on the video!

1463
01:49:03,235 --> 01:49:04,861
I didn't go inside the Sphere.

1464
01:49:05,111 --> 01:49:05,946
Yes, you did.

1465
01:49:06,154 --> 01:49:07,197
Is he alive?

1466
01:49:07,405 --> 01:49:08,490
You went inside the Sphere...

1467
01:49:08,782 --> 01:49:11,660
...and you just don't remember.
That's the problem.

1468
01:49:15,955 --> 01:49:18,041
It's not me!
I'm not going to use it!

1469
01:49:18,375 --> 01:49:20,794
Inject yourself
with the hypodermic needle.

1470
01:49:27,342 --> 01:49:28,885
It's your snakes.
See?

1471
01:49:29,093 --> 01:49:30,804
It's all a fear.
It's just a fear.

1472
01:49:31,262 --> 01:49:34,307
You can make it go away.
Just use the hypodermic needle.

1473
01:49:34,641 --> 01:49:37,727
And the ships will come
and we'll get out of here.

1474
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:41,898
What are you doing?!
You're going to kill me!

1475
01:49:46,152 --> 01:49:47,278
You can stop it.

1476
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,032
Try to pull yourself together.

1477
01:49:52,367 --> 01:49:54,410
Your fears are going to kill
all of us.

1478
01:50:08,758 --> 01:50:10,676
Please, don't open the hatch.

1479
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:13,429
You'll freeze to death in the water.

1480
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:20,645
You'll kill yourself!
Don't open the hatch!

1481
01:50:50,883 --> 01:50:52,676
I know enough
not to get killed down here.

1482
01:50:52,885 --> 01:50:55,095
Are you the most qualified
in your field?

1483
01:50:55,304 --> 01:50:57,681
What exactly are your qualifications?
Why are you here?

1484
01:50:57,932 --> 01:50:59,934
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

1485
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:04,605
Are you the most qualified?

1486
01:51:04,897 --> 01:51:07,608
You almost got me killed.

1487
01:51:09,151 --> 01:51:10,444
You're a danger to all of us.

1488
01:51:11,862 --> 01:51:13,530
Come back to reality.

1489
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,884
What are you doing?

1490
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:09,330
Are you real?

1491
01:54:15,252 --> 01:54:18,047
As real as the water
that almost drowned me.

1492
01:54:21,467 --> 01:54:23,218
You tried to kill me.

1493
01:54:27,556 --> 01:54:29,057
What are you doing there?

1494
01:54:33,437 --> 01:54:36,106
Beth, you went into the Sphere.

1495
01:54:39,818 --> 01:54:40,986
Didn't you?

1496
01:55:04,759 --> 01:55:05,844
Answer me.

1497
01:55:06,094 --> 01:55:09,389
I don't know what to think.
I feel like I can't breathe.

1498
01:55:10,515 --> 01:55:12,559
I'm losing it, you know?

1499
01:55:13,393 --> 01:55:16,354
I'm trying to keep it together, but...

1500
01:55:17,606 --> 01:55:18,982
What's going on?

1501
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:20,734
Why'd you put me out?

1502
01:55:21,901 --> 01:55:23,903
What are you guys up to?

1503
01:55:24,446 --> 01:55:26,114
You went in the Sphere, Harry.

1504
01:55:26,573 --> 01:55:27,824
So did Beth.

1505
01:55:28,283 --> 01:55:29,492
So did I.

1506
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:31,202
I think.

1507
01:55:31,786 --> 01:55:33,538
And if so, what?

1508
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:36,166
Everything that we feel or think...

1509
01:55:36,458 --> 01:55:37,417
...just...

1510
01:55:37,667 --> 01:55:38,793
...happens.

1511
01:55:39,043 --> 01:55:41,212
That's what happened
to the astronauts.

1512
01:55:41,421 --> 01:55:44,591
The astronaut in the chair,
what did you say about his head?

1513
01:55:45,133 --> 01:55:46,301
He had...

1514
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:49,512
...blunt force trauma.
He got hit in the head.

1515
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,681
They went into the Sphere one by one...

1516
01:55:51,931 --> 01:55:55,059
...became afraid of each other,
till they killed each other off.

1517
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:57,562
And we're doing the same thing.

1518
01:55:58,646 --> 01:56:00,273
I don't want to kill you.

1519
01:56:03,693 --> 01:56:05,445
Your attention, please.

1520
01:56:05,611 --> 01:56:08,990
All construction personnel
must exit the blast area...

1521
01:56:09,323 --> 01:56:10,283
...immediately.

1522
01:56:10,533 --> 01:56:13,411
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1523
01:56:13,661 --> 01:56:16,247
Mark 13 minutes and counting.

1524
01:56:16,998 --> 01:56:18,791
Want to tell me who that voice is?

1525
01:56:19,625 --> 01:56:23,504
They had explosives down here
to blow up the coral.

1526
01:56:23,754 --> 01:56:28,634
So when I went out before, I set up a
defense perimeter around the spaceship.

1527
01:56:28,968 --> 01:56:30,428
Something must have triggered it.

1528
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:33,556
Something from inside the Sphere.

1529
01:56:33,764 --> 01:56:37,685
- Nothing in the Sphere. You know that.
- Then what?

1530
01:56:38,227 --> 01:56:38,978
I don't know.

1531
01:56:40,938 --> 01:56:41,939
Then who?

1532
01:56:46,527 --> 01:56:47,820
It's me.

1533
01:56:48,863 --> 01:56:50,322
Oh, God.

1534
01:56:50,906 --> 01:56:53,784
I was just thinking
about the explosives.

1535
01:56:54,034 --> 01:56:57,371
It just flashed inside my mind.
It must've triggered them.

1536
01:57:03,586 --> 01:57:05,588
I was thinking about wanting to die.

1537
01:57:07,047 --> 01:57:09,258
You put explosives near the spacecraft?

1538
01:57:10,175 --> 01:57:11,593
Yeah, I did.

1539
01:57:13,053 --> 01:57:15,055
But they're about 100 yards away.

1540
01:57:15,723 --> 01:57:18,642
There's a lot of liquid hydrogen
left on that spacecraft.

1541
01:57:18,934 --> 01:57:21,186
If it explodes,
it'll disintegrate everything.

1542
01:57:24,189 --> 01:57:26,108
Mini-sub, now!
Let's go!

1543
01:57:30,237 --> 01:57:32,364
I hope there's a ship up there.

1544
01:57:34,825 --> 01:57:36,034
Your attention, please.

1545
01:57:36,243 --> 01:57:41,039
All construction personnel must exit
the blast area immediately.

1546
01:57:41,373 --> 01:57:44,501
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1547
01:57:44,876 --> 01:57:47,004
Mark 10 minutes and counting.

1548
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:00,434
Let's go! Let's go!

1549
01:58:01,268 --> 01:58:02,310
Come on, come on!

1550
01:58:09,276 --> 01:58:10,652
Come on, move!

1551
01:58:10,986 --> 01:58:11,987
Keep moving.

1552
01:58:12,779 --> 01:58:14,573
We're not going to make it!

1553
01:58:18,618 --> 01:58:20,912
There's not enough time.

1554
01:58:21,162 --> 01:58:22,414
Just keep moving.

1555
01:58:22,706 --> 01:58:25,917
We're not out of time. We're
not going to die here. Keep moving.

1556
01:58:39,806 --> 01:58:41,433
Let's go, Norman.

1557
01:58:41,933 --> 01:58:44,018
It's not like I drive subs, okay?

1558
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:45,520
You're driving one now.

1559
01:58:49,524 --> 01:58:50,859
Oh, my God!

1560
01:58:51,526 --> 01:58:52,819
What's going on?

1561
01:58:53,111 --> 01:58:54,070
I don't know.

1562
01:58:54,487 --> 01:58:55,947
Why are we inside the spaceship?

1563
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,240
I don't know.

1564
01:58:58,616 --> 01:58:59,284
Let's go!

1565
01:58:59,867 --> 01:59:03,121
Now alert, alert.
5 minutes and counting.

1566
01:59:04,956 --> 01:59:07,667
We're not moving.
Anybody hit the button?

1567
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:10,003
What the hell?

1568
01:59:11,838 --> 01:59:14,424
Wait a minute,
this was an elevator before, right?

1569
01:59:14,674 --> 01:59:16,843
Which one of us is doing this?

1570
01:59:17,093 --> 01:59:17,969
Oh, God.

1571
01:59:18,469 --> 01:59:21,055
Alert, alert.
Panther explosives armed.

1572
01:59:21,305 --> 01:59:23,182
Wait, wait.
We were here already!

1573
01:59:25,309 --> 01:59:27,353
How much time we got?!
Come on!

1574
01:59:28,062 --> 01:59:28,938
It's a dead end.

1575
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,648
Where are we?

1576
01:59:31,023 --> 01:59:31,983
An illusion.

1577
01:59:32,233 --> 01:59:33,818
Doesn't look like it.

1578
01:59:34,068 --> 01:59:37,196
Beth, which way?
Harry, where do we go?

1579
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:39,323
Where?
Where's where, Norman?

1580
01:59:39,573 --> 01:59:41,242
Around that corner?

1581
01:59:41,575 --> 01:59:42,785
And what's there?

1582
01:59:43,035 --> 01:59:46,539
Just another blind alley
in the maze of our minds. Illusion.

1583
01:59:46,872 --> 01:59:47,832
Maybe he's right.

1584
01:59:48,082 --> 01:59:49,959
We believe that,
we're dead.

1585
01:59:50,292 --> 01:59:52,044
Just go on. Leave me.

1586
01:59:52,378 --> 01:59:56,799
You're not going to die down here.
I'm not going to let you die. Come on.

1587
01:59:58,509 --> 02:00:00,219
I'm not going to die.

1588
02:00:03,055 --> 02:00:04,723
You have to push the button.

1589
02:00:05,057 --> 02:00:06,183
I can't see a button.

1590
02:00:06,433 --> 02:00:07,560
I can't see the button.

1591
02:00:07,810 --> 02:00:09,019
I can't see the button.

1592
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:10,688
It's no use.

1593
02:00:11,063 --> 02:00:12,523
We die down here.

1594
02:00:13,691 --> 02:00:15,859
We're running out of time.
They all look the same.

1595
02:00:17,319 --> 02:00:19,154
I don't know where we are
or what we're stuck in.

1596
02:00:19,405 --> 02:00:22,533
Where we are is stuck in the illusion
that we can change the future.

1597
02:00:22,825 --> 02:00:24,076
It's a dead end.

1598
02:00:24,451 --> 02:00:26,704
Just like I said all along:

1599
02:00:27,246 --> 02:00:28,247
We die down here.

1600
02:00:28,497 --> 02:00:29,832
Maybe he's right.

1601
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:31,333
Maybe he's right.

1602
02:00:31,583 --> 02:00:32,918
I'm not going to die.

1603
02:00:33,168 --> 02:00:34,211
Beth's not going to die.

1604
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:35,921
And you're not going to die.

1605
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:37,714
Look, just leave me.

1606
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:42,094
We're not in the spacecraft!
We're in the mini-sub! This isn't real!

1607
02:00:42,344 --> 02:00:44,471
This is your manifestation!
Let it go!

1608
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,347
It's a dead end.

1609
02:00:45,556 --> 02:00:47,099
We're not going to die here.

1610
02:00:47,349 --> 02:00:48,225
It's not our time.

1611
02:01:06,368 --> 02:01:07,786
Thank God, we're out of here.

1612
02:01:07,994 --> 02:01:09,496
Don't start celebrating yet.

1613
02:01:09,704 --> 02:01:10,288
Why not?

1614
02:01:10,497 --> 02:01:12,249
I don't think
we're going fast enough.

1615
02:01:12,499 --> 02:01:13,458
For what?

1616
02:01:13,708 --> 02:01:16,711
An underwater blast creates a suction.
It'll suck us into it.

1617
02:01:17,087 --> 02:01:19,130
That is, if the shock wave
doesn't kill us first.

1618
02:01:20,257 --> 02:01:23,635
Alert, alert.
Mark 20 seconds and counting.

1619
02:01:23,927 --> 02:01:26,179
Panther explosives are now activated.

1620
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:33,937
640 feet.

1621
02:01:34,187 --> 02:01:34,896
630.

1622
02:01:35,647 --> 02:01:36,898
620.

1623
02:01:43,988 --> 02:01:46,116
610. You a religious man, Norman?

1624
02:01:46,366 --> 02:01:48,660
Atheist. But I'm flexible.

1625
02:02:18,606 --> 02:02:20,483
Pull up, Norman!
Pull up!

1626
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,822
Come on, pull up!

1627
02:02:54,892 --> 02:02:56,394
This is Escort 7.

1628
02:02:56,644 --> 02:03:00,022
We have sighted OSSA mini-sub,
bearing 105.

1629
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:01,273
Repeat. Bearing 105.

1630
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:05,569
Preparing to make contact
for decompression procedure.

1631
02:03:18,624 --> 02:03:19,875
What's going on?

1632
02:03:20,125 --> 02:03:21,669
More of nothing.

1633
02:03:26,507 --> 02:03:29,385
I want to thank you for saving my life.

1634
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:33,097
Interesting life to save.

1635
02:03:38,102 --> 02:03:39,061
You get some sleep.

1636
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:42,481
I have no idea what to tell them
when they debrief us.

1637
02:03:53,951 --> 02:03:55,535
My back is killing me.

1638
02:03:56,119 --> 02:04:00,332
Next time I have to remember to stretch
before I jettison from a mini-sub.

1639
02:04:12,969 --> 02:04:15,639
We've been trapped in here
for about 3 days.

1640
02:04:15,972 --> 02:04:19,434
They want an explanation. We ought
to figure out what we want to tell them.

1641
02:04:20,018 --> 02:04:22,938
Killer jellyfish, squid, sea snakes...

1642
02:04:23,188 --> 02:04:27,609
...and an alien being in the form
of a giant totemic golden ball? Please.

1643
02:04:28,693 --> 02:04:33,323
We destroyed $100 million worth
of equipment down there and people died.

1644
02:04:34,157 --> 02:04:36,576
They want answers.
What do you guys want to tell them?

1645
02:04:38,453 --> 02:04:39,496
Why aren't we dead?

1646
02:04:39,871 --> 02:04:40,830
What?

1647
02:04:41,081 --> 02:04:41,873
You said...

1648
02:04:42,207 --> 02:04:44,000
"The future can't be changed. "

1649
02:04:44,834 --> 02:04:46,127
It can't.

1650
02:04:46,503 --> 02:04:49,964
But in the spaceship they called it
an Unknown Entry Event.

1651
02:04:50,715 --> 02:04:54,344
Like we never got here alive
to tell them about it.

1652
02:04:54,969 --> 02:04:59,766
You said we wouldn't survive. If you
can't change the future, we'd be dead.

1653
02:05:00,725 --> 02:05:02,477
We're alive.
We're not dead.

1654
02:05:04,646 --> 02:05:07,774
And in 2 minutes we'll be in a room
full of military guys.

1655
02:05:08,024 --> 02:05:09,776
They know about the Sphere.

1656
02:05:10,026 --> 02:05:14,113
We know Barnes got ahold of them
before we lost contact to the surface.

1657
02:05:14,364 --> 02:05:15,448
What do you want to tell them?

1658
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:18,576
Why bother?
The Sphere's destroyed.

1659
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:21,287
But we still have the power,
am I right?

1660
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:27,126
I don't know if I trust them with it.
I don't know if I trust you.

1661
02:05:27,502 --> 02:05:31,672
I don't want to not be able to sleep,
afraid I'll wake up...

1662
02:05:31,923 --> 02:05:34,091
...having manifested
some nightmare...

1663
02:05:34,342 --> 02:05:37,178
...and there's all kinds
of weird things in my apartment.

1664
02:05:37,553 --> 02:05:38,763
That's a frightening thought.

1665
02:05:39,013 --> 02:05:40,264
No kidding.

1666
02:05:41,432 --> 02:05:42,558
So...

1667
02:05:43,893 --> 02:05:45,686
...if we still have the power...

1668
02:05:47,021 --> 02:05:48,689
...what do you want to do with it?

1669
02:05:54,195 --> 02:05:55,905
God knows what they'll do with it.

1670
02:05:56,697 --> 02:06:00,576
Are you worried what will happen
if it falls into the wrong hands?

1671
02:06:00,910 --> 02:06:03,454
Yeah. Frankly, I don't know
what the wrong hands are.

1672
02:06:03,704 --> 02:06:06,332
Or what's worse:
the wrong hands or our hands.

1673
02:06:06,582 --> 02:06:08,375
We are the wrong hands.

1674
02:06:09,043 --> 02:06:10,461
We proved it.

1675
02:06:10,753 --> 02:06:15,299
You know, the 3 of us are enlightened
people, we're intelligent...

1676
02:06:15,549 --> 02:06:17,718
...we even recycle
our cans and bottles.

1677
02:06:18,093 --> 02:06:22,014
But when we got our shot,
we manifested every mean...

1678
02:06:22,264 --> 02:06:26,518
...distorting, vengeful,
paranoid thought you could think of.

1679
02:06:27,061 --> 02:06:28,228
We did.

1680
02:06:28,479 --> 02:06:29,063
Right?

1681
02:06:29,605 --> 02:06:31,440
You believe we still have the power.

1682
02:06:32,066 --> 02:06:34,777
Of course we still have it.

1683
02:06:35,611 --> 02:06:38,155
And that's the answer to the equation.

1684
02:06:38,781 --> 02:06:40,574
We can't change the future.

1685
02:06:40,824 --> 02:06:44,369
We're not dead.
But they don't know. Why?

1686
02:06:46,121 --> 02:06:47,164
I'm not following you.

1687
02:06:47,998 --> 02:06:50,792
Because we have the power...

1688
02:06:51,293 --> 02:06:52,753
...to forget.

1689
02:06:55,631 --> 02:06:56,965
To forget.

1690
02:06:57,591 --> 02:06:59,509
You want us to agree to forget?

1691
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:02,679
Wait a minute, are we sure
that we want to do this?

1692
02:07:03,013 --> 02:07:04,264
Yes.

1693
02:07:07,434 --> 02:07:09,978
This is the greatest discovery
in the history of mankind.

1694
02:07:10,228 --> 02:07:12,689
We're just going to white it out
like it's a typing error?

1695
02:07:14,191 --> 02:07:15,484
I'm sure.

1696
02:07:18,153 --> 02:07:19,613
What about you, Beth?

1697
02:07:20,489 --> 02:07:22,073
What's the matter, Norman?

1698
02:07:22,324 --> 02:07:24,409
It's a little hard to let go of.

1699
02:07:24,659 --> 02:07:25,994
Something that could've been...

1700
02:07:26,995 --> 02:07:28,497
...this gift?

1701
02:07:28,955 --> 02:07:31,291
The power to make your dreams
come true.

1702
02:07:31,833 --> 02:07:34,794
We're given the greatest gift
in the history of mankind.

1703
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:36,796
We're given this magic ball.

1704
02:07:37,047 --> 02:07:38,089
And it says...

1705
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:42,677
"Imagine what you will
and you can have it. "

1706
02:07:44,137 --> 02:07:47,557
That's an extraordinary gift,
but we're so primitive we...

1707
02:07:49,642 --> 02:07:52,854
We manifested the worst in us,
because what we have inside us...

1708
02:07:53,104 --> 02:07:57,442
...is what we have inside of us, instead
of the best of us. What does that say?

1709
02:08:00,069 --> 02:08:01,821
We weren't ready, Norman.

1710
02:08:02,989 --> 02:08:05,867
We have what's called an imagination.

1711
02:08:08,036 --> 02:08:11,289
I mean, look what we're capable of.

1712
02:08:11,539 --> 02:08:12,707
We can...

1713
02:08:18,755 --> 02:08:20,173
We're not ready.

1714
02:08:26,095 --> 02:08:27,722
A long time ago...

1715
02:08:29,057 --> 02:08:31,059
...I did something very...

1716
02:08:31,392 --> 02:08:34,312
...very inappropriate with you,
and I'm sorry.

1717
02:08:35,605 --> 02:08:36,564
Okay?

1718
02:08:36,814 --> 02:08:37,732
Okay.

1719
02:08:38,733 --> 02:08:42,862
I don't have any answers, Norman,
but these guys are coming so let's...

1720
02:08:43,362 --> 02:08:46,365
Okay, we're going to agree to forget...

1721
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,367
...the Sphere...

1722
02:08:49,076 --> 02:08:50,286
...the power...

1723
02:08:51,078 --> 02:08:52,580
...all that ever was.

1724
02:08:59,045 --> 02:09:02,298
I don't know how to get this going.
You're the mathematician.

1725
02:09:02,631 --> 02:09:04,175
How about we just count to 3?

1726
02:09:04,592 --> 02:09:06,385
I couldn't have come up with that.

1727
02:09:09,722 --> 02:09:11,098
I'll start.

1728
02:09:14,769 --> 02:09:15,436
One.

1729
02:09:22,735 --> 02:09:23,736
Two.

1730
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:28,073
Three.

1731
02:09:37,583 --> 02:09:40,711
Can somebody tell me
what the hell that's supposed to be?

1732
02:09:50,262 --> 02:09:51,764
Why are you holding my hand?

1733
02:09:52,014 --> 02:09:54,391
No, you were holding my hand.
