1
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,367
I'm sorry.

2
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:58,686
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

3
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,000
Sir, she's breaking out!

4
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,207
What are we looking for?

5
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:33,566
She jumped over the fence!

6
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:47,518
A couple of trains came through here
about the time she escaped.

7
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,801
Do you think she could have
gotten this far in that time?

8
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,441
Is she that fast?

9
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,440
She is that fast.

10
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,641
And this too.

11
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:41,640
- $3.10.
- Three dollars and ten cents?

12
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,076
- Your change.
- Thank you.

13
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:48,876
Can I help you?

14
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,159
The total is $ 17.95.

15
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,447
Here's your card.

16
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,085
Are you gonna buy those?

17
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,846
Have a nice trip.

18
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:25,639
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?

19
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:29,158
- Sir, it's not here.
- The porter said he put it on the cart.

20
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,285
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.

21
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:55,926
<i>Government authorities said it was
the largest earthquake to strike...</i>

22
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,926
<i>He's riding Greased Lightning.</i>

23
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,324
<i>That was Shorty Kincaid.</i>

24
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,086
Enjoy the view.

25
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,357
Excuse me.

26
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:52,441
<i>We shouldn 't be seen together.</i>

27
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:56,044
<i>Father hasn 't been dead long.
Do you think Arlen suspects?</i>

28
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,280
<i>No. It's not too soon
for us to be together.</i>

29
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:02,763
Tickets.

30
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:07,445
Are you traveling by yourself?

31
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,037
You're 12?

32
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,523
Someone meeting you
in Los Angeles?

33
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,202
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.

34
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:39,720
Our little girl did this?

35
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,287
She's not a little girl.

36
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:45,084
DNA typing and material found in
those wounds proves it was her.

37
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:49,082
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.

38
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:50,522
We should stop the trains.

39
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,397
And have the railroad and police
ask questions we can't answer?

40
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,400
We'll put key personnel at
every stop along these lines.

41
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,759
I want a team to track her.

42
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:02,157
Hunt her down.

43
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:05,846
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.

44
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:10,405
- Thanks for taking care of my cat.
- We'll take good care of him.

45
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,280
I won't be gone very long.

46
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,007
Take care.

47
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,523
Bye-bye.

48
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:19,447
Are you still having problems
with the people at work?

49
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,525
They point their finger
at me saying...

50
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:25,758
...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.

51
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,085
Why? Because I have feelings?

52
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:29,687
Because I feel?

53
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:34,487
There's someone at the door.

54
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:39,527
I won't answer that. Whoever it is
can come back at the end of the hour.

55
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:41,677
That's for me.

56
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:46,002
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.

57
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:47,997
I know.

58
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:50,681
Gotta go.

59
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:52,166
Mr. Fitch will be with you all
in just a moment.

60
00:14:58,848 --> 00:14:59,997
Well...

61
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,768
I guess we all must be here
for the same reason...

62
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,283
...whatever that is.

63
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,916
I'm Dan Smithson...

64
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,923
...and I don't know why
I'm here either.

65
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,359
But they said they needed me and
it was important, so I came.

66
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,527
What do you do, Dan?

67
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,037
I'm an empath.

68
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:26,843
Sometimes they show me awful things
people have done.

69
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,326
I try to tell them why they did it.

70
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,565
What qualifies you for that?

71
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:35,285
I feel things deeply, that's all.

72
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,165
What am I feeling now?

73
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:47,120
You wanna believe that
nothing affects you...

74
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,125
...that you're not afraid of anything.

75
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:53,767
But you're curious...

76
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,639
...just like the rest of us.

77
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:01,407
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.

78
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:03,286
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.

79
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:06,241
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.

80
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,322
And who are you,
and what do you do?

81
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,567
Preston Lennox.

82
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:14,887
And if I'm here...

83
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,284
...the shit has hit the fan.

84
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:20,561
What exactly is your area
of specialty, Mr. Lennox?

85
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:24,798
I'm a freelance solution to
our government's problems.

86
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:27,526
What exactly might they be?

87
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:32,081
The kind people don't usually
like to talk about.

88
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:35,760
You hunt people, don't you?

89
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,676
I guess so.

90
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,643
You in here? It's a little late for TV.

91
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:00,407
You in here, honey?

92
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,962
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.

93
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:54,966
I'm in charge of this operation.

94
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:57,204
Would you sit a little closer, please?

95
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:09,122
In November of 1974...

96
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:11,958
...a small group from S.E.T. I...

97
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,120
...S- E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...

98
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,558
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...

99
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:19,719
...to send a message to whoever
was listening.

100
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,528
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...

101
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,236
...including structure
of human DNA...

102
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,444
...a map of our solar system...

103
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,640
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.

104
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:37,207
In January of 1993, Arecibo
received a message back...

105
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:39,561
...from an extra terrestrial...

106
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:41,281
...unknown source.

107
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:42,643
That's great.

108
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,198
Intelligent life beyond this planet?

109
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:46,557
Yes.

110
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:49,198
There were two communications.

111
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:53,765
The first message turned out to be
a superior catalyst for methane.

112
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,202
We now have the potential...

113
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:58,480
...to produce infinite energy
from this clean-burning fuel.

114
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:02,479
This convinced us we were dealing
with a friendly intelligence.

115
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:06,960
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA...

116
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:10,281
...with friendly instructions
on how to combine it with ours.

117
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:14,322
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.

118
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:15,603
Basically...

119
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:19,118
...the new combined
DNA sequence...

120
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,484
...was injected into 100...

121
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,886
...human ova.

122
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:28,043
We got 7...

123
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:29,357
...to divide.

124
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:31,087
Four petered out.

125
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,524
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

126
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,084
And we allowed one to grow.

127
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,964
Its code name is "Sil."

128
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:41,841
That's after 2 hours.

129
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:44,443
One day.

130
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,123
Two days.

131
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:49,677
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

132
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:51,287
A week.

133
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:54,003
- It's a girl.
- Yes.

134
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:58,801
We decided to make it female
so it would be more docile...

135
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:01,881
...and controllable.
- More docile and controllable, huh?

136
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:05,122
Well, I guess you guys
don't get out much.

137
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,725
That's her 1 month
after she was born.

138
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,756
So you kept her caged in there?

139
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:15,277
It was safer to keep her isolated.

140
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,525
She didn't like being locked up.

141
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,441
She didn't like being alone.

142
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,122
Didn't she?

143
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:28,001
She's hiding something.
Something inside.

144
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:30,007
You're right, Dan.

145
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:34,236
This is three months after
she was born. Watch carefully.

146
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:37,926
What the hell was that?

147
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,517
Back the tape up.

148
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,167
Watch her eyes.

149
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:47,043
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.

150
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,366
- She's having horrible nightmares.
- It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

151
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,082
Got me a little anxious.

152
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:58,161
It made the research team
a little anxious too...

153
00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:01,600
...so the decision was made
to terminate the experiment...

154
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,597
...to run more research to see
what we were dealing with.

155
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:09,525
You were going to gas her?

156
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:11,646
That was the decision.

157
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:14,841
It makes you feel mad.

158
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,757
You feel mad that you had to
kill her, don't you?

159
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:20,236
I don't know.

160
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,556
Yes.

161
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:38,486
Yesterday the body of a transient was
found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

162
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,323
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

163
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:44,600
...he was killed by our creation,
by our Sil.

164
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,241
Found any other bodies?

165
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:47,887
- Not yet.
- You will.

166
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:49,681
She's a predator.

167
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,520
Her eyes are in front...

168
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,521
...so she can judge the distance
to her prey.

169
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:56,797
That's right.

170
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:58,322
Where'd you learn that?

171
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:01,601
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

172
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,965
I caught that show myself.

173
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:07,997
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?

174
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,561
As the...

175
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,557
...non-scientist amongst us,
are you clear about what's going on?

176
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:15,637
I think so.

177
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,119
You created a monster...

178
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:22,202
...with a formula you got
from outer space.

179
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:26,324
The damn thing got away. Now you
want us to hunt it down and kill it.

180
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:29,201
Now, is that pretty close?

181
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,047
I guess.

182
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:32,437
You don't want us...

183
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,606
...to capture her alive
so that we can study her?

184
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:41,120
Laura, I think this is strictly a
search and destroy operation.

185
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,645
Nobody ever asked me to find
anything they didn't want dead.

186
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:48,083
I'm sorry for you.

187
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,960
Yeah, well...

188
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:52,567
Thank you, Dan.

189
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:54,961
I'm sorry for her.

190
00:22:57,568 --> 00:22:59,604
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

191
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:03,847
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles. This is
the terminal stop for the Desert Star.</i>

192
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,477
<i>All passengers please disembark.</i>

193
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,925
Something bad happened here.

194
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:26,006
- No shit.
- Crushed her larynx.

195
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,800
She was afraid.

196
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:30,323
She's scared, frightened.

197
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:33,281
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.

198
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,003
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

199
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,318
She's storing calories for something.

200
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:40,887
Any ideas?

201
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,597
Oh, my...

202
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:46,960
Well, that's...

203
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:49,365
That looks like some sort of...

204
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:52,276
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

205
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:54,798
What are we looking for,
a giant moth?

206
00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:59,040
If that is a cocoon...

207
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,637
...she'll be fully-grown now.
- Fully-grown.

208
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:04,203
Maybe that's how
she got by our people.

209
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:05,961
They were looking for a child.

210
00:25:06,328 --> 00:25:07,761
She is a child.

211
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:11,641
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

212
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:22,123
Get the conductors' ID and credit card
numbers on your computer.

213
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,279
There's no sign of them on the train.

214
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:27,282
- Let's assume she took them.
- I'll see to that.

215
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,086
She kills if she's threatened.

216
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,567
And she has no remorse about it.
None.

217
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:35,003
Of course, Los Angeles
is perfect for her.

218
00:25:35,328 --> 00:25:36,727
It's a city of the future.

219
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:38,077
Anything goes.

220
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,927
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.

221
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:43,080
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

222
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:45,199
Whatever she does,
no one will notice her.

223
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:47,478
Well, whatever. So...

224
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:51,286
Los Angeles is where the battle
will be fought...

225
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:53,876
...and won.

226
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:20,280
You look very pretty.

227
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:23,447
Do you have a hundred?

228
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,037
Here we are.

229
00:26:28,608 --> 00:26:32,726
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.

230
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,047
Are you foreign?

231
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:41,357
Do you speak English?

232
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:45,679
- Yes.
- Here. You keep this.

233
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:49,124
Here, let me take this.

234
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,557
Be careful here.

235
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:53,037
Yes.

236
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:00,486
Watch your step.

237
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:14,324
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

238
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:18,806
...is being moved to some empty virus
research labs at the university.

239
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:22,364
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.

240
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,680
Check into your rooms. Everyone out
front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

241
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:27,287
What will we do?

242
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:29,683
Process the evidence from the train.

243
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:33,244
Could we try growing this creature
with its own DNA?

244
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:38,363
We do a version without ours this time
and investigate its vulnerabilities.

245
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:39,597
That'd be good.

246
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:42,198
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.

247
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:45,042
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage...

248
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:48,081
You're right. At least we'd know
what we were dealing with.

249
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:46,804
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.

250
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:50,161
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
- I want a room.

251
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:55,004
62, including tax. That'll just
about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

252
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:15,286
<i>Hi. Come here often?</i>

253
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,716
<i>What's your sign?</i>

254
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:29,405
<i>Tired of brunette?</i>

255
00:29:29,888 --> 00:29:31,241
<i>Change.</i>

256
00:29:31,488 --> 00:29:33,683
<i>Change the color of your hair.</i>

257
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:35,122
<i>Color-Tress.</i>

258
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,243
I've increased the magnification.

259
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:54,198
When I pierce the cell,
the foreign DNA will be introduced.

260
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:05,957
Shit!

261
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:08,286
The camera's gone down.

262
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,443
Excuse me.

263
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:12,727
Do you have a replacement camera?

264
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:16,404
We do, but it'll take time for
the technician to replace it.

265
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,118
No. This happens in my lab
all the time. It's simple to replace it.

266
00:30:20,328 --> 00:30:21,966
You saying you can do it?

267
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,802
Sure I can. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

268
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:28,080
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.

269
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,477
I'll do it.

270
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:32,123
I'll do it.

271
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:35,126
- Man of action, I like that.
- That's me.

272
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,119
Can you get that one for me?

273
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:11,399
Give me the camera.

274
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:26,206
Something's... Something's wrong.

275
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:33,646
Christ, It's started already.

276
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:37,167
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?

277
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:39,359
Laura, Press, get the top back on.

278
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,836
Here you go.

279
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,686
She must have penetrated the cell.

280
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:47,603
- Shit.
- What was that?

281
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:48,843
He dropped the bolt.

282
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:53,327
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

283
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,607
Can they hear me in there?

284
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:58,002
Laura, Press...

285
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:01,161
...get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?

286
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:07,562
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?

287
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,004
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.

288
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,647
- No, can't get it!
- Press...

289
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,566
...you gotta get the bolt!

290
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,443
- Can't get it. The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.

291
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,321
Press. Oh, my God.

292
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,564
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Holy shit.

293
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:26,082
I can't let them out.

294
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:28,597
- Press, look.
- Come on.

295
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,447
Fitch, let us out of here!

296
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:33,441
Open the goddamn door!

297
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:36,680
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!

298
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,321
- Let them out.
- I can't!

299
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:40,678
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!

300
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:44,563
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!

301
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,400
Open up the door!

302
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:51,007
Press, Press.

303
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:53,767
What the fuck is that?!

304
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:56,238
Laura, get to the other door!

305
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:58,399
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't!

306
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,360
- Let her out!
- I can't!

307
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:02,166
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!

308
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:04,723
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!

309
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:06,162
Get out of the way!

310
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:08,245
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!

311
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,766
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!

312
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,040
I have to do it!

313
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,641
You have two minutes to kill it.

314
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:21,921
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.

315
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:30,247
Laura, watch out!

316
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:34,601
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!

317
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,247
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

318
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:41,526
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

319
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,567
Laura...

320
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:57,203
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.

321
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:00,120
It's dead! Open the door!

322
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,006
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

323
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:08,527
Oh, God, it's not dead.

324
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:17,639
- Shit.
- What'll we do?

325
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,287
<i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

326
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:22,002
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!

327
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,846
- Let them out.
- I can't do that.

328
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:25,885
- I have to follow protocol!
- What protocol?!

329
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:27,800
The protocols by which
we're doing this!

330
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:30,562
You didn't tell them that
before they went in.

331
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,118
<i>- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10...</i>

332
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:35,762
- Fitch, let them out!
- I must follow protocol.

333
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:37,162
Let them out, Fitch!

334
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:39,604
Go. Get out of there!

335
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,643
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

336
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,520
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.

337
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:47,959
The protocol is to burn the room
if anything went wrong!

338
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:09,839
Where's a good place
to find a man?

339
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:13,923
There's plenty of guys at the Id
around the corner. It's a club.

340
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:16,363
You won't have trouble
meeting somebody there.

341
00:35:16,568 --> 00:35:17,523
Thank you.

342
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,119
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.

343
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,324
I need your credit card...

344
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:26,044
...for room incidentals,
long distance calls and so forth.

345
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:27,926
Credit card? Zip zap?

346
00:35:28,368 --> 00:35:30,484
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?

347
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:33,283
There you go. Thanks. All right.

348
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:34,563
Thank you.

349
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:36,716
Wait a minute!

350
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,681
You don't want this falling
into the wrong hands.

351
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,282
No.

352
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:50,564
<i>Here's Justin Crawl. It's through
and it's covered by the goalie.</i>

353
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:53,723
Yeah?

354
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,640
The conductor's credit card
turned up...

355
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:58,362
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.

356
00:35:58,608 --> 00:35:59,757
<i>Let's go.</i>

357
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,397
You two.

358
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,796
Enjoy yourselves.

359
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:14,320
You, legs. You're in. Go on.

360
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:37,366
Where are you from?

361
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:40,758
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?

362
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:42,964
- I'm foreign.
- Really?

363
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:44,877
Easy, easy.

364
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:47,807
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

365
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,327
I'll take you.

366
00:36:49,528 --> 00:36:50,881
- You will?
- Yeah.

367
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:53,044
Okay. I'm going
to the little girls' room.

368
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:55,846
Wait right here.

369
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:57,687
I'll be right back.

370
00:36:57,888 --> 00:36:59,287
I'll be right here.

371
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:19,325
Whatever it takes, right?

372
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,604
All's fair in love and war.

373
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,242
Can't see much on that.

374
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:51,002
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

375
00:37:51,448 --> 00:37:53,086
See if we can get a better look.

376
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,007
She looks nice.

377
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:57,519
Do you have any idea
where she went?

378
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:01,124
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.

379
00:38:01,368 --> 00:38:03,962
I suggested a club called
the Id around the corner.

380
00:38:05,888 --> 00:38:07,162
Get the tape.

381
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,442
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

382
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:30,640
Where is this party?

383
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:32,443
I don't know.

384
00:38:41,888 --> 00:38:43,924
Whoa, you can't park there!

385
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,807
Back that out!

386
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,525
- No, you can't go in there.
- What's going on?!

387
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:07,445
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

388
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,362
There's always some action
in this part of town.

389
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:26,963
<i>Blue-eyed blonde.</i>

390
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:30,962
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10"
tall. Who'd she leave with?

391
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,676
Blonde leaves with a guy
is hardly news around here.

392
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:35,759
Name the top attractions. No losers.

393
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:38,203
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.

394
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:40,364
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

395
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:42,166
I'm thinking.

396
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:45,003
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

397
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,237
That's him.

398
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:50,003
Come on. Let me show you
the rest of the house.

399
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,883
I'm still sweaty from that place.

400
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:54,481
It's so crowded.

401
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:00,763
Like it?

402
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:03,123
Yes.

403
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,761
I feel like a shower.

404
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:06,843
You want one?

405
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:09,043
Tell you what.

406
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:10,641
I'm taking one.

407
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:12,480
You wanna take one later...

408
00:40:12,768 --> 00:40:14,087
...no problem.

409
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,846
Take off your clothes.

410
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:01,042
I want to see you.

411
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:09,681
Very nice.

412
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:21,122
Take me back.

413
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:23,159
What are you talking about?

414
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,086
You know why we came here.

415
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:26,963
I've changed my mind.

416
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,477
All right. You said "no."

417
00:41:30,008 --> 00:41:32,158
It's duly noted. Come here.

418
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:33,397
I wanna go!

419
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:36,520
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!

420
00:41:39,368 --> 00:41:41,962
- All right.
- That's better.

421
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:10,684
What's happening? Kills a girl
at the club, kills this guy.

422
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:13,806
I'd say she fits the definition
of a psychopath.

423
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:15,766
Nothing inhibits her.

424
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,563
No moral sense, no social structure.

425
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:22,764
She wasn't exactly smothered with a
mother's love or taught good manners.

426
00:43:23,008 --> 00:43:24,646
I asked what was happening.

427
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:26,920
He did something, she was angry.

428
00:43:27,168 --> 00:43:29,966
She'll kill if she's threatened
or if anyone gets in her way.

429
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,323
Of what?

430
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:32,717
Her life cycle.

431
00:43:33,008 --> 00:43:34,964
I think she's trying to mate.

432
00:43:35,328 --> 00:43:36,283
Reproduce.

433
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:37,842
Okay.

434
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,720
So why did she kill the girl?

435
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:41,640
Sexual competition.

436
00:43:41,888 --> 00:43:43,321
She's hard on the competition.

437
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:44,882
Now she managed to mate.

438
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:49,003
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.

439
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:51,398
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

440
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:54,116
What's her problem?
She was here with him.

441
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:55,881
Maybe she rejected him.

442
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:57,925
She probably has special senses.

443
00:43:58,128 --> 00:44:02,201
Rats can sense diseased or genetic
damage in their potential mates...

444
00:44:02,448 --> 00:44:03,801
...so we can test his body...

445
00:44:04,048 --> 00:44:08,405
...for hereditary diseases or defects
that would make him a loser...

446
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:09,836
...essentially.

447
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:11,277
Needles.

448
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:14,880
Maybe he was a doper,
or a diabetic.

449
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:17,841
Either way would make him
unacceptable. Excuse me.

450
00:44:19,888 --> 00:44:21,037
All right.

451
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:25,364
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

452
00:44:25,568 --> 00:44:28,128
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?

453
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:30,359
He pissed her off.

454
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:32,917
Some men, when rejected,
get insistent.

455
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:35,636
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.

456
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:38,721
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.

457
00:44:39,088 --> 00:44:41,841
More docile and controllable,
huh, Fitch?

458
00:44:55,848 --> 00:44:58,237
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?

459
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:01,682
I think she'd want to be alone now.

460
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:05,525
She won't come here with
all these cars outside.

461
00:45:05,728 --> 00:45:08,561
You're assuming she could
find her way back here.

462
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:09,917
She could.

463
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:11,677
What is it?

464
00:45:13,248 --> 00:45:15,079
Maybe menstrual blood.

465
00:45:15,968 --> 00:45:18,482
If she's menstruating,
she can reproduce.

466
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:19,882
Yes, I know.

467
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,996
Shit.

468
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:00,727
Oh, Jesus.

469
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:02,117
Excuse me.

470
00:47:03,048 --> 00:47:05,687
Call a paramedic! Anybody
got a phone?

471
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:13,767
<i>If your commute takes you westbound
on the 10 freeway...</i>

472
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:15,441
<i>... expect an hour delay.</i>

473
00:47:15,688 --> 00:47:17,963
<i>The drive will be slow to Malibu.</i>

474
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:27,037
The video enhancement
is not that great.

475
00:47:27,288 --> 00:47:29,324
How old do you think she is?
Twenty, 23?

476
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:33,483
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

477
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:35,605
Her biological clock must be
in hyperdrive.

478
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:36,883
She wants a baby.

479
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,682
If she has a child our problems
have just begun.

480
00:47:39,928 --> 00:47:42,840
If her offspring is male and develops
at the same rate as Sil...

481
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:46,522
...it could reproduce in 6 months.

482
00:47:47,848 --> 00:47:50,203
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

483
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:51,807
Fitch.

484
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:56,239
When a predatory species
is introduced...

485
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:58,006
...into a closed ecological system...

486
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,120
...the extinction of the weaker species
is inevitable.

487
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:03,922
They found the murdered guy's BMW,
out of gas in Santa Monica.

488
00:48:04,288 --> 00:48:05,323
What's her name?

489
00:48:05,568 --> 00:48:07,604
- I don't know.
- Who are you?

490
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:11,727
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.

491
00:48:11,968 --> 00:48:13,640
You think she's got insurance?

492
00:48:13,888 --> 00:48:17,244
I don't know. Just put it on
my credit card for now.

493
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:21,238
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.

494
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:30,677
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

495
00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:36,042
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.

496
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,518
It looks like a scapula fracture.

497
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:49,206
Your shoulder wound.

498
00:48:52,448 --> 00:48:54,166
What's going on here?

499
00:48:59,368 --> 00:49:01,802
Doctor, we need you now.
A child burn victim just came in.

500
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:03,760
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.

501
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:06,436
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?

502
00:49:06,648 --> 00:49:08,604
Please. We need you immediately.

503
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:18,356
You're okay.

504
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:19,723
I'm okay.

505
00:49:19,968 --> 00:49:22,357
I was sure you were
seriously injured.

506
00:49:22,888 --> 00:49:23,957
I'm okay.

507
00:49:24,288 --> 00:49:26,165
You are. It's a miracle.

508
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,083
Can we go?

509
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:30,922
Did the doctor say you could go?

510
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,283
Yes.

511
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:36,037
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.

512
00:49:38,688 --> 00:49:42,966
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital
called in with some weird story.

513
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:45,204
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.

514
00:49:45,568 --> 00:49:46,762
Laura...

515
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,204
...Press, take a car, check it out.

516
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:51,876
- Parkbay Hospital?
- Yeah, Parkbay.

517
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:55,283
She walked.

518
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:57,283
She walked.

519
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:00,236
She walked that way...

520
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:02,956
...not too long ago.

521
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:12,686
Got some fruit and cheese.

522
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:15,997
What is that?

523
00:50:16,408 --> 00:50:17,841
You mean the hot tub?

524
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:19,923
A hot tub.

525
00:50:20,448 --> 00:50:21,722
I love this place.

526
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:24,681
It's away from the traffic
and business and people.

527
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:27,562
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. Anymore.

528
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:29,203
Here.

529
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:31,246
We'll immortalize the moment.

530
00:50:40,968 --> 00:50:42,196
Look at the camera.

531
00:50:47,488 --> 00:50:50,764
- This girl literally reformed her bones.
- It's her.

532
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:52,996
Who checked her in?

533
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:55,040
I don't know. Let's find out.

534
00:50:55,288 --> 00:50:58,519
She had no insurance so this guy
put it on his own credit card.

535
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:02,603
Here's the file. John F. Carey.

536
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:07,283
You don't have a driver's license
or home address?

537
00:51:07,488 --> 00:51:10,844
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.

538
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,759
Give us a printout
of what you've got.

539
00:51:14,008 --> 00:51:15,236
No problem.

540
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:19,517
Some candy?

541
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,245
It's in the Palisades and
he's got a phone number.

542
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:35,806
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to get John Carey on the line.

543
00:52:04,648 --> 00:52:06,366
I'd better get the phone.

544
00:52:13,408 --> 00:52:15,638
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?

545
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:17,076
Yeah.

546
00:52:17,288 --> 00:52:20,564
Tell him he's about to copulate
with a creature from outer space.

547
00:52:21,568 --> 00:52:23,320
- Copulate, huh?
- Yeah.

548
00:52:24,928 --> 00:52:26,077
I like you.

549
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:27,517
I know.

550
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:34,404
It's not too soon for us
to be together.

551
00:52:35,888 --> 00:52:37,606
No, it's not too soon.

552
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:40,967
You don't need these.

553
00:52:41,248 --> 00:52:43,318
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

554
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:57,436
What's the matter?

555
00:52:58,048 --> 00:52:59,276
Take it easy.

556
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:03,447
Just relax.

557
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:06,316
There's plenty of time.

558
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:15,917
What is it?

559
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,439
I think someone's at the door.

560
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:21,797
Don't go.

561
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:24,519
Please. I want a baby.

562
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:26,964
What?! Excuse me?

563
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:38,486
Let's go around the side.

564
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:21,203
<i>Outside.</i>

565
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:17,005
- What happened?
- A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

566
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:19,556
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.

567
00:56:19,807 --> 00:56:21,843
I wanna make sure
she's not still here.

568
00:56:47,927 --> 00:56:50,999
Perhaps we should check the body
for evidence that they've had sex.

569
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,362
I used to be scared
at the sight of blood.

570
00:57:01,207 --> 00:57:02,925
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

571
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:05,566
Oh, yes.

572
00:57:30,327 --> 00:57:32,966
- Help me, please!
- Oh, my God. What's the matter?

573
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:35,685
We found this in the living room.

574
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:38,721
She liked him.

575
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:42,125
Well, not enough.

576
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:45,765
Can't see any more on that than
we did on the video monitor.

577
00:57:46,287 --> 00:57:48,118
He didn't get a good picture of her.

578
00:57:48,327 --> 00:57:51,239
There's no evidence of semen
in the hot tub water.

579
00:57:51,727 --> 00:57:53,160
Maybe she took it with.

580
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,403
So she probably
hasn't managed to mate.

581
00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:58,565
- We interrupted her.
- Yes, I think we did.

582
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,684
Give me something I can use.

583
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:03,879
What have you
come up with lately, Fitch?

584
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:10,766
She's not scared of us.

585
00:58:11,207 --> 00:58:12,356
That's for sure.

586
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:17,526
We're all beat.

587
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:19,639
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

588
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,000
Tomorrow night...

589
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:24,045
...we'll go back to the club.

590
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:26,765
<i>- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.</i>

591
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:30,916
She's not stupid.

592
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:32,560
She won't repeat herself.

593
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:35,879
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.

594
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:37,082
I'm not sure.

595
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:39,887
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.

596
00:58:40,087 --> 00:58:41,679
I'd rather try the club...

597
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:46,125
...than sit at the command center
reminiscing about how close we got.

598
00:58:59,007 --> 00:59:01,646
She would make one excellent
biological weapon.

599
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:05,641
If someone thought we were some
kind of galactic weed that would...

600
00:59:05,887 --> 00:59:07,764
...spread through the universe.

601
00:59:08,887 --> 00:59:10,957
So what you're saying is that...

602
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:13,477
...she's the cure and
we're the disease.

603
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:15,406
That's well said.

604
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:17,920
"Baker, Laura.

605
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:21,682
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi Valley, California."

606
00:59:21,927 --> 00:59:23,246
That's you, right?

607
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:25,645
Last time I checked.

608
00:59:26,087 --> 00:59:27,918
What do you do for kicks out there?

609
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:31,998
Pine for guys like you.

610
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:34,283
That's what I thought.

611
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:55,641
So anyone hungry?

612
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:59,877
No, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

613
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,197
- Good night.
- Yeah. Night.

614
01:00:03,487 --> 01:00:06,479
- I'll have something to eat with you.
- Thanks, Dan.

615
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:08,916
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

616
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:11,718
Please untie my hands.

617
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,800
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
- I have them.

618
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:19,646
I think they tell me who I am.

619
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:22,125
Why are you doing this to me?

620
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:26,439
I don't know why I'm here.

621
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,996
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

622
01:01:30,807 --> 01:01:32,684
- Do you?
- No!

623
01:01:36,087 --> 01:01:38,920
- Why do you think you're here?
- I don't know.

624
01:01:39,927 --> 01:01:41,440
Please let me go.

625
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:43,917
Please. Please, let me go.

626
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,044
I wouldn't hurt you.

627
01:01:48,407 --> 01:01:49,886
I promise.

628
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:52,123
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Yes, you would.

629
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,366
You just don't know it yet.

630
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:57,483
No, I wouldn't!

631
01:01:57,687 --> 01:01:59,006
Please!

632
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:02,842
My hands are hurting me.

633
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:08,195
Thank you.

634
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:10,281
Thank you.

635
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:18,160
Oh, my God!

636
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:35,166
Oh, my God, no!

637
01:02:36,407 --> 01:02:38,716
No! No!

638
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:34,844
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

639
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:37,039
They just don't like to show
how they feel.

640
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:38,521
What?

641
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,796
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

642
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:43,845
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

643
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:47,079
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

644
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:51,446
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a
rest. This is a complete waste of time.

645
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:55,959
Get a feeling you're on
a wild goose chase?

646
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:57,486
Yeah.

647
01:04:58,647 --> 01:04:59,762
Excuse me.

648
01:05:58,007 --> 01:06:00,680
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

649
01:06:11,527 --> 01:06:12,676
It's you.

650
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:20,682
Hey!

651
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,523
She's here! Hey!

652
01:06:29,647 --> 01:06:31,399
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.

653
01:06:31,607 --> 01:06:32,722
Here.

654
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:40,446
Get in the van.

655
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:44,164
Everybody get in the van!

656
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:55,240
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.

657
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:10,645
We're going up Nichols Canyon. One
of you try to block her at Mulholland.

658
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:28,366
Watch it!

659
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:29,039
Oh, my God!

660
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:06,316
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.

661
01:09:06,567 --> 01:09:09,286
Tell them what you want,
just don't tell them the truth.

662
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:12,599
I don't buy her showing up at
the club. It's too damn convenient.

663
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:15,522
Seeing is believing or
don't you trust your eyes?

664
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:17,803
Get back! Get all these people back!

665
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,920
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

666
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:22,436
Sir!

667
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:26,162
We found a severed thumb in
one of the doors that got ripped off.

668
01:09:26,407 --> 01:09:29,444
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.

669
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:31,564
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

670
01:09:32,007 --> 01:09:34,885
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.

671
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:37,282
Tomorrow you can go back
to your lives.

672
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:39,722
Congratulations on a job well done.

673
01:09:43,127 --> 01:09:45,004
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

674
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:47,086
I don't think so.

675
01:09:57,407 --> 01:10:00,843
<i>Leave me a message.
And Frank, I'm going to dinner.</i>

676
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:03,561
<i>Where are we meeting?
Bye, sweetie.</i>

677
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,282
Waiter.

678
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:10,120
Well, I guess we won.

679
01:10:11,447 --> 01:10:15,281
- We won, science lost.
- I didn't think we'd get her this way.

680
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:18,238
- Not that easy.
- You sound like you'll miss her.

681
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,516
I guess I will.

682
01:10:20,447 --> 01:10:22,005
I think I respected her.

683
01:10:24,407 --> 01:10:28,525
I know this was a hellish job, but I
really enjoyed working with you three.

684
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:31,520
And since Uncle Sam is buying,
let's have another round.

685
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:32,682
Waiter!

686
01:10:33,007 --> 01:10:34,759
I don't... I don't drink.

687
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:36,640
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

688
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:40,046
You wanna dance?

689
01:10:40,247 --> 01:10:42,238
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

690
01:10:45,327 --> 01:10:47,363
- All right.
- Okay.

691
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:07,204
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

692
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:11,523
I guess I've had a few, but
they don't hang around very long.

693
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:14,403
I guess I keep too many secrets.

694
01:11:15,047 --> 01:11:16,366
You wanna share one with me?

695
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:18,601
- Right now?
- Yeah.

696
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:27,158
I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

697
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:29,477
- Really?
- No.

698
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:31,605
Well, it does most people.

699
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:38,402
I wouldn't wanna
never see you again.

700
01:11:45,447 --> 01:11:46,596
- Hey.
- What are you...?

701
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:50,516
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

702
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,046
I'm sorry.

703
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:55,076
You okay?

704
01:11:55,287 --> 01:11:57,755
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.

705
01:11:58,007 --> 01:11:59,406
She's dead, Press.

706
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,996
The tests on the thumb
proved it was her.

707
01:12:02,247 --> 01:12:05,284
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.

708
01:12:06,007 --> 01:12:09,795
I think as long as you feel
she's out there, you got a mission.

709
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:12,362
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

710
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:15,163
Well, maybe not. So what?

711
01:12:18,487 --> 01:12:20,045
Thanks for the dance.

712
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:35,082
Good night.

713
01:12:41,887 --> 01:12:43,036
What do you call this?

714
01:12:43,447 --> 01:12:45,483
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

715
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:47,995
It's got tea in it?

716
01:12:49,007 --> 01:12:50,122
Nope.

717
01:13:06,927 --> 01:13:08,804
Smells nice, can I try some?

718
01:13:09,647 --> 01:13:11,046
Help yourself.

719
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:17,759
Does it work on your boyfriend?

720
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,838
Yeah. As a repellent.

721
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:26,883
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably
good shape for a man his age.

722
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:40,083
One Long Island Ice Tea.

723
01:13:42,287 --> 01:13:44,403
I like these cups of tea.

724
01:13:46,647 --> 01:13:48,524
- What?
- That's great.

725
01:13:54,327 --> 01:13:56,079
Hey, give me one of those.

726
01:13:56,927 --> 01:13:59,395
I like these cups of tea, man.

727
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:02,437
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

728
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:06,802
So?

729
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:09,641
She's going to bed.

730
01:14:09,887 --> 01:14:11,115
I guess.

731
01:14:13,087 --> 01:14:14,645
She still...

732
01:14:15,607 --> 01:14:17,279
...wants to see you though.

733
01:14:20,887 --> 01:14:23,242
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right about that.

734
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:50,363
I'd hate to be in here
during an earthquake.

735
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:51,795
Yeah.

736
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:53,726
What floor do you want?

737
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:55,725
Ten, please.

738
01:15:05,207 --> 01:15:07,163
I like your perfume.

739
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:08,882
You do?

740
01:15:09,527 --> 01:15:12,599
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I get out here.

741
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:17,796
Good night.

742
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:55,198
- Hi.
- Hi.

743
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,646
Did you want something?

744
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:16,922
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

745
01:17:00,687 --> 01:17:02,200
Housekeeping.

746
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:06,405
Dan. Dan.

747
01:17:06,607 --> 01:17:09,599
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.

748
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,679
Women think I'm strange.

749
01:17:13,207 --> 01:17:14,481
I don't feel well.

750
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,486
Don't be silly.

751
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,963
Just go over there and talk to them.

752
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:22,239
I have to go. And I think
you should leave with me, okay?

753
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:27,002
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

754
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:30,642
Okay.

755
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:33,046
I'll see you tomorrow.

756
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:37,719
Housekeeping.

757
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:52,881
- Hi.
- Hi.

758
01:17:53,087 --> 01:17:55,362
I was sitting over there, wondering...

759
01:17:55,607 --> 01:17:58,963
...what two intelligent, glamorous
women were doing without dates.

760
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,640
My name's Stephen Arden.

761
01:18:00,887 --> 01:18:02,878
I teach anthropology at Harvard.

762
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:04,640
- I lived in Boston once.
- Yeah?

763
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:06,002
For a year.

764
01:18:06,207 --> 01:18:08,960
- Froze my butt off.
- It's cold in Boston.

765
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:11,482
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.

766
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:18,406
Cute little socks.

767
01:18:20,087 --> 01:18:21,440
Stand up.

768
01:18:59,807 --> 01:19:01,286
How'd you get in here?

769
01:19:01,647 --> 01:19:03,717
- I stole the key.
- What?

770
01:19:04,247 --> 01:19:06,886
I saw you downstairs, but
you were with all those people.

771
01:19:07,727 --> 01:19:09,319
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

772
01:19:12,847 --> 01:19:15,042
This kind of thing doesn't
usually happen to me.

773
01:19:16,847 --> 01:19:18,280
I just want to be with you.

774
01:19:28,487 --> 01:19:29,966
Oh, yes.

775
01:19:43,727 --> 01:19:45,046
What about protection?

776
01:20:38,207 --> 01:20:40,084
She's here. She's here.

777
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:09,320
Press?

778
01:21:09,687 --> 01:21:11,279
Someone's at the door.

779
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:14,122
Who's there?

780
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:15,516
Press, Laura.

781
01:21:15,727 --> 01:21:17,638
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

782
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:20,356
Christ, what does he want?

783
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:32,646
- What's the problem, Dan?
- I just got this terrible feeling.

784
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:35,845
I get this strange thought,
this image of Sil with Arden.

785
01:21:36,087 --> 01:21:37,406
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.

786
01:21:37,847 --> 01:21:39,997
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.

787
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:43,877
I went to his room and there's
someone in there with him.

788
01:21:44,087 --> 01:21:47,443
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

789
01:21:47,727 --> 01:21:51,322
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.

790
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:53,603
I know it's Sil, I know it!

791
01:21:54,207 --> 01:21:55,162
Okay.

792
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:57,478
I believe you. I'll get dressed.

793
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:14,645
I enjoyed that immensely.

794
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,915
- I felt it.
- What?

795
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:39,561
It's started.

796
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:42,080
What's started?

797
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:43,242
Life.

798
01:22:44,527 --> 01:22:46,438
Oh, my darling girl.

799
01:22:47,007 --> 01:22:50,966
In some cultures, women believe
they know the moment of conception...

800
01:22:51,207 --> 01:22:52,765
Don't you believe me? Feel.

801
01:22:58,087 --> 01:22:59,566
Holy shit!

802
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:07,164
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

803
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:21,322
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.

804
01:23:21,527 --> 01:23:22,846
Laura, come with me!

805
01:23:23,087 --> 01:23:24,202
Come on!

806
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:31,046
If she's pregnant, we gotta
get to her before she gives birth.

807
01:23:31,247 --> 01:23:34,000
God. We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

808
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:37,882
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!

809
01:23:38,087 --> 01:23:41,238
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

810
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:43,079
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

811
01:23:43,287 --> 01:23:47,678
We can trap her. The fire door opens
from the inside at the bottom exit.

812
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:48,882
Then what?

813
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:52,436
Holy shit.

814
01:23:52,647 --> 01:23:55,605
- Oh, my God.
- The bitch went through a steel door!

815
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:58,606
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!

816
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:11,956
- You saw her?
- She was gone before we got here.

817
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:13,759
- Here.
- You saw her!

818
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,884
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?

819
01:24:16,127 --> 01:24:18,357
- Where's Press?
- He took off down that tunnel.

820
01:24:32,807 --> 01:24:35,640
She kills if she feels threatened.

821
01:24:35,847 --> 01:24:37,883
She kills if she feels threatened.

822
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,158
She must've come through here.

823
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:24,678
She went down here.
There's no other way.

824
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:26,240
Yeah, she's down there.

825
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:28,636
Let's go.

826
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,362
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

827
01:26:22,447 --> 01:26:24,483
Which way did she go, Dan?

828
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:27,524
- I don't know.
- What?

829
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:29,638
I'm not sure. She's here.

830
01:26:29,887 --> 01:26:34,563
Think. You're supposed to have some
extrasensory power! Which way?

831
01:26:35,367 --> 01:26:39,406
- Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know! I don't know!

832
01:26:42,487 --> 01:26:45,160
- I think she went that way.
- That's good enough for me.

833
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,085
You think she went that way?

834
01:26:48,367 --> 01:26:50,927
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.

835
01:26:51,127 --> 01:26:53,402
I'll go this way. You come with me.

836
01:26:53,647 --> 01:26:55,638
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.

837
01:26:57,367 --> 01:26:59,005
I think she went this way.

838
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:17,441
Dan?

839
01:27:20,887 --> 01:27:22,115
Dan?

840
01:27:57,887 --> 01:27:59,036
Fitch. Fitch.

841
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:01,886
Dan?

842
01:28:04,447 --> 01:28:05,721
What happened?

843
01:28:14,647 --> 01:28:15,875
I can feel her.

844
01:28:16,567 --> 01:28:17,795
She's that way.

845
01:28:18,567 --> 01:28:20,046
She's that way.

846
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:26,441
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.

847
01:28:26,847 --> 01:28:28,405
Never thought I'd want to.

848
01:29:02,407 --> 01:29:05,240
It's this way. It's back here.

849
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:37,237
Hey, she went in here.

850
01:29:42,327 --> 01:29:44,602
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

851
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:47,565
Okay, stand back.

852
01:31:00,527 --> 01:31:01,642
Is that oil?

853
01:31:01,967 --> 01:31:03,195
Looks like it.

854
01:31:10,607 --> 01:31:13,644
I'm going back there to see
if I can flush her out.

855
01:31:13,847 --> 01:31:16,520
If she comes back through here,
let her have it.

856
01:31:31,207 --> 01:31:33,004
Dan. Dan!

857
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:33,319
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.

858
01:32:33,527 --> 01:32:34,755
I don't know.

859
01:33:33,047 --> 01:33:34,241
Dan.

860
01:33:54,887 --> 01:33:56,366
Okay.

861
01:33:58,247 --> 01:33:59,441
It's okay.

862
01:34:01,047 --> 01:34:02,241
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

863
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:04,236
You come here.

864
01:34:06,487 --> 01:34:08,364
Come on. I got you.

865
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:15,442
Press, something's happened
to Dan!

866
01:34:16,447 --> 01:34:17,800
You okay?

867
01:34:20,647 --> 01:34:21,875
Shit!

868
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:25,366
Dan?

869
01:34:26,367 --> 01:34:27,925
Dan?

870
01:34:28,767 --> 01:34:29,995
I'm stuck!

871
01:34:34,887 --> 01:34:37,321
I need your help! I'm stuck!

872
01:35:05,207 --> 01:35:07,084
Dan, you gotta hang on!

873
01:35:14,127 --> 01:35:15,640
Press!

874
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:20,796
Dan, keep on.

875
01:35:34,407 --> 01:35:36,841
Press!

876
01:36:24,727 --> 01:36:25,921
Hang on, Dan!

877
01:36:28,207 --> 01:36:29,322
Hang on!

878
01:36:30,527 --> 01:36:31,482
I got you.

879
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:35,204
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

880
01:36:35,927 --> 01:36:37,201
Shit.

881
01:36:44,527 --> 01:36:45,926
Hang on!

882
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:48,996
Hang on, Dan!

883
01:36:53,167 --> 01:36:54,964
Get rid of her, Press!

884
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:00,442
Duck your head.

885
01:37:02,007 --> 01:37:04,157
Let go, you motherfucker.

886
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:09,201
- I got you. Hold on, I got you.
- Shit.

887
01:37:14,647 --> 01:37:16,160
I thought I was dead.

888
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:22,604
I thought you'd drank your
last Long Island Ice Tea.

889
01:37:22,807 --> 01:37:24,081
Yeah, I thought we all had.

890
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,477
Hey, you okay?

891
01:37:29,007 --> 01:37:30,156
Yeah, I'm okay.

892
01:37:31,327 --> 01:37:33,124
My pants are a little messed up.

893
01:37:33,727 --> 01:37:34,955
But I'm okay.

894
01:37:37,327 --> 01:37:39,682
She was half us,
half something else.

895
01:37:40,527 --> 01:37:42,563
I wonder which was
the predatory half.

896
01:37:43,887 --> 01:37:45,366
The dead half.

897
01:37:45,727 --> 01:37:47,126
Let's get the hell out of here.

898
01:38:29,847 --> 01:38:33,044
I never thought I'd be so happy
to be back in a sewer.

899
01:43:36,527 --> 01:43:38,483
