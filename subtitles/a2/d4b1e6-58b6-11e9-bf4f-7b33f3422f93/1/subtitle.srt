1
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,691
Okay, thanks for the lift.

2
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:37,165
Where you going to look for him?

3
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,135
l don't know, but if l find
a pink Cadillac,

4
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,397
he'll be around somewhere.

5
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:43,537
So long.

6
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:57,779
Who's that?

7
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,845
lt's Lon.

8
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,220
Hi, Lonnie.
l'm making chili.

9
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:02,191
But if you want breakfast,
l'll come out.

10
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:03,250
No, thanks.

11
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:05,022
Daisy, you seen my Uncle Hud?

12
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:06,222
l chicken-fried him

13
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:08,128
a steak last night, about 7:00.

14
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:09,530
Haven't seen him since.

15
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,534
All right.

16
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,661
Daisy, l'm taking two doughnuts.

17
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:14,830
Okay, honey.

18
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:16,840
Just leave a dime
on the counter.

19
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:18,068
All right.

20
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,842
lt's 26 after 6:00

21
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:31,446
on a Thursday, and 7 1 degrees
in the good ol' summertime.

22
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:34,150
On the <i>Bobby Don Brewer Show.</i>

23
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,728
Must have had quite a brawl
in here last night.

24
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:53,072
l had Hud in here last night
is what l had.

25
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,909
Sure looks it.

26
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,552
Mr. Larker!

27
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:05,578
Hey, there, Mr. Larker!

28
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:06,782
Hey, there, Lon!

29
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:09,257
You gonna rodeo this year, Lon?

30
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,989
Not me. l ain't looking to get
my stomach stepped on.

31
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:13,792
What you doing
in town this early?

32
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,024
Trying to run down Hud.

33
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:17,465
Hud? Didn't l see
that big Cadillac car of his

34
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,991
parked right down the street?

35
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,230
Pretty sure l did.

36
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,669
l don't know if l'd go

37
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:23,605
disturbing him, if l was you.

38
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,302
Well, l ain't dying to,
but l've been told to get him.

39
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,315
Hud?

40
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,745
Hud?

41
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:32,569
Honcho...

42
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:36,010
l just hope for your sake
that this house is on fire.

43
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,513
Well, l'm sorry
to roust you out, Hud,

44
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:38,809
but we got trouble at the ranch.

45
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,750
Well, you've got trouble
right here, bub.

46
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:43,719
l was just getting
nicely tucked in.

47
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:45,847
You come tiptoeing
through the tulips.

48
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,153
Granddad wants you,
and he said right now.

49
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:51,024
Oh, he said, ''right now''?

50
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:52,289
Well, do you think maybe

51
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:54,455
it would be all right
with my old daddy

52
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,295
if l stopped to button up
my shirt?

53
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,527
Oh, come on, will you, Hud?

54
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:01,799
You got me out of the wrong side
of bed this morning.

55
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:03,897
Don't go snapping at my heels.

56
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,670
Just liable to turn around
and bite you.

57
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,817
Hud?

58
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:24,650
Thank you, honey.

59
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,214
Hey. Hi, Joe.

60
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,457
Which one of you two

61
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:01,726
is coming out of my house
at 6:00 in the morning?

62
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:06,892
l asked you a question.
Which one, damn it?

63
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:09,064
Well, l hate
to have to tell you,

64
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,403
seeing it's my own nephew,

65
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,737
but it's
this snot-nosed kid here.

66
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:12,742
Been lookin' for him all night.

67
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,243
Just flushed him out
a couple of minutes ago.

68
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:15,608
- l'll kill the little punk.
- Oh, now, Joe...

69
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:16,873
- Just let me at that kid.
- Wait a minute.

70
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:18,403
- l'll kill him, l'll kill him.
- Now Joe, you know

71
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:19,745
you got sugar diabetes.
Just take it easy.

72
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:20,772
l'll handle this thing for you.

73
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,114
l don't need any help from you.

74
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:23,915
l can do it myself.
Now, you get out of my way.

75
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:27,117
Now, Joe, you can't afford
to get worked-up, buddy boy.

76
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,125
l ain't gonna let
that kid get away...

77
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,719
l'll lower his temperature
some, l promise you.

78
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,995
All right, hotshot.

79
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,556
You and l are gonna finish
this little discussion

80
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:39,592
behind the woodshed.

81
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,642
Thank you.
Thanks a whole lot.

82
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,840
Relax.

83
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:53,372
Be able to charge a stud fee

84
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,646
by the time that story
gets around town.

85
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,084
Yeah, if l'm still alive.

86
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,987
l could have gotten hurt
back there, you know that?

87
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,684
So could l.

88
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,886
Ain't it lucky you were handy?

89
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,590
Well, maybe you ought to take
me along as a regular thing.

90
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,327
The pace would kill you, sonny.

91
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,328
And now that
the dust has settled,

92
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,667
what's so red-hot important

93
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:17,002
that my daddy has to drag
me back on my day off?

94
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,974
Wants to ask your advice
about something.

95
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,533
Ask me?

96
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:23,808
He hasn't asked me about
anything in 15 years.

97
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:27,578
Just work out there from
the shoulders down, myself.

98
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,881
You gonna be able
to make it all day,

99
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,751
after a night
like you put in?

100
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,756
At a hundred years
old like him,

101
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,258
l don't need a week's
sleep to be fresh.

102
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,988
He can't help being
an old man, Hud.

103
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,767
Boy, you sure do drive
this thing, don't you?

104
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:25,405
That'll be Hud.

105
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,142
He's parked right
in my flower bed.

106
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,653
Good morning, Hud.

107
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:47,856
Morning.

108
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,024
l'm sorry to cut
into your time off.

109
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,533
Lonnie, close
that screen door.

110
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,263
We're getting
a lot of flies in here.

111
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,270
Well, l see the house
is still standing,

112
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:57,829
and you're pouring coffee
in your saucer, as usual.

113
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,967
How come you pushed
the panic button on me?

114
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,877
We come up with
a dead heifer in the night.

115
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:05,710
ls that what you dragged me
back here for? A dead cow?

116
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:07,444
l'm kinda worried
about this one.

117
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:10,180
She wasn't cut
or crippled-looking.

118
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,710
No swellin' on her.

119
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:14,451
Was there any Johnson grass
or milkweed around?

120
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:17,688
Nothing. This may be something
l ought to know about.

121
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,753
Jose and Jesse are out there
now, keeping off the buzzards.

122
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,162
Lon, stay out of those berries.

123
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:23,563
They're going in the pie.

124
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,795
Well, let's not stand around
here till dinnertime.

125
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,234
l got other things
to do today.

126
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,430
Watch that cigarette ash.

127
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:29,665
lt's going in the pot.

128
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:33,164
l'll go bring the pickup around.

129
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,177
How come you're always

130
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:43,981
running your car
over my zinnias?

131
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,987
l've been trying to get

132
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:46,648
those things to come up
for two weeks.

133
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,715
Don't plant 'em where l park.

134
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:50,726
You're cheerful this morning.

135
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,819
Missy, your job
is to keep house,

136
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,830
not worry
about my disposition.

137
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,058
Frying pan's still on.

138
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:57,327
Want a couple of eggs?

139
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,062
Or did you have
breakfast in bed?

140
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,471
Nope. l didn't quite
get around to breakfast.

141
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,517
Morning, boys.

142
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,719
Mr. Bannon.

143
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,920
Morning, Mr. Bannon.

144
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:33,724
Pretty hard to keep
them birds away.

145
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,890
Had to use a flashlight
most of the night.

146
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,339
Ah, look at them buzzards.

147
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,536
They'll be back.

148
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:50,341
You couldn't scare 'em off
with artillery.

149
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:52,346
l wish you wouldn't
do that, Hud.

150
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:54,042
They keep the country clean.

151
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,109
Besides, there's a law
against killing buzzards.

152
00:11:57,153 --> 00:12:00,486
Well, l always say the law
was meant to be interpreted

153
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:02,616
in a lenient manner.

154
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:03,955
And that's what l try to do.

155
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,620
Sometimes l lean
to one side of it.

156
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:07,094
Sometimes l lean to the other.

157
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,290
l don't like to break the law

158
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:10,797
on my place, Hud.

159
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,332
Well, she ain't gonna sit up
and tell us herself.

160
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:45,363
Well, what do you think, Hud?

161
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:48,196
l don't know.

162
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:50,501
She looks clean to me.

163
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,008
Well, something killed her.

164
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,907
l think l'll call up
the state vet.

165
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:55,911
He might know.

166
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:56,912
Well, what for?

167
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:58,004
This is our land.

168
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,674
l don't want
any government men on it--

169
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,012
any time, any place, anywhere.

170
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,142
This ain't nothing.

171
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,277
Just leave her lay.
Let the buzzards have her.

172
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,289
No, l don't believe l will.

173
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,416
Before l go to bed,
l'll call the government man

174
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,551
and ask him to come out
and take a look at her.

175
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:14,162
Yeah, that's the stuff.

176
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,288
Bring some jellybean in here

177
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:17,127
to tell you how to run
your own business.

178
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,963
Only don't ask me
what l think from now on.

179
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:22,300
l'd like for you and Lon
to stay out here for a while.

180
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:24,306
l'll take these boys
back with me

181
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,170
so they can snooze a little.

182
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,008
Lon, you take that water bag
so you won't parch.

183
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:04,273
Honcho, why don't you sit up
with our sick friend here?

184
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:06,975
l got a healthy one in town
that won't wait.

185
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,284
Hyah!

186
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:15,585
Come on, hyah.

187
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:47,315
Hey!

188
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:48,948
Hey! Hey!

189
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,520
Boy, it's a good thing
you showed up.

190
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:53,960
We blew a tire on the pickup,

191
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,328
and l got to get this stuff
back for dinner.

192
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,060
Need any help, there, Jesse?

193
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,829
l'm all right, Hud. Thanks.

194
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:08,666
You think your hand
would fall off

195
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:09,700
if you opened the door?

196
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,286
You pick up my beer?

197
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,294
Two six-packs.

198
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:28,956
That ought to see you
till tomorrow.

199
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:30,295
Keeping count on me?

200
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:31,959
l keep tripping
over those empties,

201
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:32,990
l know that.

202
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:40,840
Boy, somebody in this car
smells of Chanel No. 5,

203
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,003
and it isn't me--
l can't afford it.

204
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,443
Well, you sure
weren't riding the range

205
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,642
this afternoon, were you?

206
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,310
l sure wasn't.

207
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,319
No.

208
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:53,321
l just wish l knew
where some gals

209
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:54,982
get the time during the day.

210
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:56,889
l don't know--
by the time l get through

211
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,520
scrubbing the kitchen floor,
cleaning out the bathtub

212
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:00,790
and hanging up the clothes...

213
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,730
They just drop
everything, honey.

214
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:04,926
l suppose it does
beat housework.

215
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,264
Want an orange?

216
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:07,269
No.

217
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:08,270
l'll peel it for you.

218
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,931
No, thanks.

219
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:13,271
H-Hey, look,
it says ''Florida'' on it.

220
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,140
We grow 'em
right here in Texas,

221
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:17,611
and then they send 'em in
all the way from Florida.

222
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:19,807
That makes sense,
doesn't it?

223
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,044
Yeah.

224
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:28,813
Oh, uh, the checker
at the A&P market,

225
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:31,952
he said it's Truman Peters' wife
you're seeing.

226
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:34,121
ls that what he says?

227
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,290
Mm-hmm.

228
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:38,926
Uh, he says she's got
a bad temper.

229
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:43,632
He says her maid quit her
'cause she hollers so much.

230
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,537
Well, our maid's
gonna get canned

231
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,269
'cause she's talking too much.

232
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:51,040
Hey, you want a Fig Newton?

233
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,071
Nope.

234
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,680
Just leave a little something

235
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,188
for dinner, will ya?

236
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,495
l don't believe it.

237
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,826
You're still eating bread?

238
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,593
After l gave you steak
and flour gravy

239
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,293
and hominy and fried okra
and onions

240
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,460
and hot rolls?

241
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,470
Well, it looked like a
lot when we set down,

242
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,630
but it sure melted away.

243
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,640
Hud didn't want any dinner?

244
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,641
He's prettying up.

245
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,767
Said he'd eat later.

246
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,300
What's for dessert?

247
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,108
You think a big freezer full

248
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,308
of peach ice cream
would hold you?

249
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,078
Boy, l've been waiting
all winter long

250
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,277
for those locker-plaid
Alberta peaches.

251
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,979
Oh, is that what
you've been waiting

252
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,044
all winter for, sugar?

253
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,453
How 'bout
those peachy pinups

254
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,787
you keep hidden in
with your shorts and socks?

255
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,156
That's my private drawer.

256
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,660
You stay out of there, Alma.

257
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,787
l'm a girl, honey.

258
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,989
They don't do a thing for me.

259
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,622
l'll dish up
the ice cream, Mr. Bannon.

260
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,530
You have it on the
front porch. lt's cooler.

261
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,092
That'll be fine, Alma.

262
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,899
Go on, before you wet
your didie.

263
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,808
Alma!

264
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,282
Alma.

265
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,944
Yeah?

266
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,283
Alma!

267
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,289
Yeah!

268
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,121
Give me a clean, white shirt.

269
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,285
Boy, you're real big

270
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,295
with the ''please''
and ''thank you,'' aren't you?

271
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,956
Please get up
off your lazy butt

272
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,626
and get me a clean,
white shirt. Thank you.

273
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,775
Had a little trouble

274
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,648
getting the lipstick
out of this one.

275
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,176
Just try the brand
you're wearing.

276
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,483
Maybe it'll wash out easier.

277
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,511
Let's not.

278
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,881
Look, you ain't getting
any younger.

279
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,222
What are you saving it for?

280
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,888
The tabs are in the collar.

281
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,332
Hear the whippoorwill?

282
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,531
l think
there's two of them.

283
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,903
You know, l've never seen

284
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,931
one of those birds
in my whole life.

285
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,945
All l do is hear them
calling across the flat.

286
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,277
What are you
thinking about, Lon?

287
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,874
Oh, l don't know.

288
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,044
Just looking up ahead, l guess.

289
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,951
You know, to what's coming.

290
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,923
Thinking about your worries
and your ambitions, are you?

291
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,151
Yeah, that,

292
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,286
having a car of my own
to tear around in,

293
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,625
and girls.

294
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,622
Well, l expect you'll get
your share of what's good,

295
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,635
and a boy like you deserves it.

296
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,102
Hey, it's getting late.

297
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,631
Boy, my daddy sure looks
like his collar was choking him.

298
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,041
Those were his Sunday best.

299
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,637
l don't remember him any.

300
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,978
l do.

301
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,644
You don't carry a picture
of Hud around with you, do you?

302
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,313
No, l don't.

303
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,322
But he's your son,
same as my dad was.

304
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,654
Yep, he is.

305
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,160
What are you holding
against him, Granddad?

306
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,426
He knows,
and you don't need to.

307
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,726
Here you go.

308
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,734
Ah.

309
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,735
Thanks.

310
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,736
Ain't you having any?

311
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,862
A little too
many calories.

312
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,531
l'm trying to lose
a couple of pounds.

313
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,165
Listen, Mr. Bannon,
if you don't mind,

314
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,937
l'm gonna leave those
dishes till later.

315
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,341
l just gotta get off these feet.

316
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,901
The kitchen's
your department, Alma.

317
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,709
Yeah, l've seen enough
of it for today.

318
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,185
Hud, are you planning on
going back to town tonight?

319
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,589
Well, l didn't get washed up

320
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,355
to sit on the front porch
and listen to the frogs mate.

321
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,361
l'd like for you

322
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,158
to make it back here
before morning.

323
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,687
The vet'll be here early.

324
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,359
All right.

325
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,368
lt's pretty good. Peachy.

326
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,700
Oh, you can't get much air
through this nylon.

327
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,171
Well, you ought to go around

328
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,073
in a sarong, Alma,
like they do in the South Seas.

329
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,077
Oh, yeah,
that'd be a lot of laughs.

330
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,676
You're half native already.

331
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,477
l haven't seen you
in a pair of shoes

332
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,914
since you come to work here.

333
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,042
Oh, l wore 'em once.

334
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,350
l've things to get married in--
black satin pumps.

335
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,288
l don't have 'em anymore
or the man either.

336
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,350
l'm going to get to town.

337
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,330
Alma, you want to blow
some foam off of some beer?

338
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,525
No, thanks.

339
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,330
l'm going to get up
out of this swing.

340
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,337
Set some biscuits, go to bed.

341
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,430
l'll settle
for half that action.

342
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,236
l'll go with you, Hud.

343
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,343
Well, what big deal
you got lined up, sport?

344
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,353
A snow cone or something?

345
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,354
No, l just thought

346
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,879
l'd catch a ride with you,
that's all.

347
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,392
All right, come on,
let's make tracks.

348
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,556
You didn't need me for anything,
did you, Granddad?

349
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,827
No. No, you go on, if you like.

350
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,595
Just be careful.

351
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,144
You drive, sport.

352
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,213
What was that all about?

353
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,738
lt's a story l'll tell you
someday when l'm drunk.

354
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,274
Come on, gig this thing
a little, will you?

355
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,472
Eh, it's a lonesome old night,
isn't it?

356
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,570
Ain't they all.

357
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,153
Boy, l love that sound.

358
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,988
Goes right through me.

359
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:18,258
lt scares the hell
out of the cattle.

360
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,628
Know what trains always
make me think about?

361
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,725
No, but l got a strong feeling
you're going to tell me.

362
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,834
l guess l just like
'em, that's all.

363
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,892
Keys.

364
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,292
Well, golly.

365
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,030
Boy, just look at that
Las Vegas saddle.

366
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,802
You couldn't lift
that hunk of junk

367
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,069
on a horse with a crane.

368
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,077
Yeah, it is pretty noisy.

369
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,874
Where you think you're going?

370
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,108
- l'm just tagging along.
- Not with me, you ain't.

371
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,911
You go tie on a
couple of Dr Peppers.

372
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,418
l'll see ya.

373
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,887
Hey, come up here and
have a drink with us!

374
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,981
Come on, now!

375
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,187
Hi, Mr. Kirby.

376
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,755
Hi.

377
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,642
Read that one?

378
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,077
Yeah, twice.

379
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,774
lt's about the best book
you ever had

380
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,076
on your paperback stand.

381
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,880
Pretty steamy, ain't it?

382
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,647
Oh, l don't know.

383
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,155
People in it seem
a lot like the ones l see.

384
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,656
Did you read the part

385
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,216
where the sergeant gets her
for the first time?

386
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,321
Yeah, l read that part.

387
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,805
Hi.

388
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,550
l sure have seen
an awful lot of you

389
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,747
for one night.

390
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,586
l'm just headed for
the square, is all.

391
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,827
Where are you headed?

392
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,726
Well, just to keep you
up-to-date,

393
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,493
l am making my way
to Mrs. Reuben Fletcher's house.

394
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,330
l don't think that's a house

395
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,893
you're likely to have heard
very much about.

396
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,837
Well, l've heard some.

397
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,670
l am out of my three-
cornered pants, you know.

398
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,266
l have been for some time.

399
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,641
How old are you?

400
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,475
Fantan-- a fast 1 7.

401
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,174
Boy, when l...

402
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,814
When l was your age,

403
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,183
l couldn't get enough
of anything.

404
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,246
That was the summer
you were born.

405
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,689
Your ma died...

406
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:04,889
and your daddy was feeling
a little wild about things.

407
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,898
He bought us a '27 Chevy.

408
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,957
Kept it tied together
with baling wire,

409
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,764
hit every honky-tonk
in the country.

410
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,464
l don't know which
we run the hardest--

411
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,304
that car or them country girls

412
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,277
who came to them dances.

413
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,837
Boy! We do-si-do'd
and chased a lot

414
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,975
of girlish butts around
that summer.

415
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,145
Now, l wouldn't mind
going that route myself.

416
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,048
Come on along.

417
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,262
No, l don't think so.

418
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,235
All right.

419
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,279
Hey, wake up.

420
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,289
Come on, Lonnie.

421
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,291
Open your eyes.

422
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,952
You going to stay here
till dinnertime?

423
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,291
What do you want?

424
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,955
l want you to get up.

425
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,964
l can't stay here

426
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,625
rasslin' around with you
all morning.

427
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,792
Why not? l kind of like it.

428
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah, l bet you do.

429
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,162
That's enough out of you.

430
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,966
Now, come on, get up.

431
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,131
Can't do that, Alma.

432
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,639
Are you sleeping
in the raw again?

433
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,641
Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,642
Listen, l got two pair

435
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,234
of nice, ironed
cotton pajamas in there.

436
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,472
How come you're not using them?

437
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,809
l don't know, they strangle me.

438
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,314
Mm-hmm. Come on.

439
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,975
What do you sleep in?

440
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,884
ln my own room,
with the door locked.

441
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,911
You ever wear any of those
little, uh, shorty things?

442
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,321
What kind of question is that?

443
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,483
Just wonder.

444
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,925
Does your mind usually run
in that direction?

445
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,929
Yeah, it seems to.

446
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,658
Boys with impure thoughts
come out in acne.

447
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,995
Did you know that?

448
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,467
Oh, that's all bull, Alma.

449
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,336
Keep it up, you'll see.

450
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,704
Hurry up.

451
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,372
The vet's coming
this morning.

452
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:22,024
Well, let's get away
from this stink.

453
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:24,053
l got all l need here.

454
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:27,595
Mr. Bannon...

455
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:30,195
l'm going to ask you
to get your cattle together,

456
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,329
all of them.

457
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:33,067
l'm going to have
to make an inspection.

458
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:34,836
An inspection for what?

459
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,241
Well, for what killed
that heifer.

460
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:38,870
l hope l'm wrong,
but l'm very much afraid

461
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:40,073
you got the worst kind
of trouble

462
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:42,139
a cattle man can have.

463
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:45,209
l think that cow died
of foot-and-mouth disease.

464
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:52,817
Oh, me.

465
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,354
l never thought
it'd be anything like that.

466
00:28:57,398 --> 00:28:58,695
Well, let's have it.

467
00:28:58,732 --> 00:28:59,858
What are we in for?

468
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,765
Well, y'all get
your herds together.

469
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,235
We're going to have
to take some samples.

470
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,294
Bring in a few healthy calves

471
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:05,702
and a couple of
horses from outside,

472
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:06,797
infect them artificially,

473
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,966
and then...

474
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:09,532
just wait and see what happens.

475
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:10,703
l'll tell you what'll happen--

476
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:11,870
they turn up sick,
you kill them.

477
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:13,140
That's right, isn't it, mister?

478
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,841
lf the calves turn up sick
and the horses don't,

479
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:16,474
it's foot-and-mouth--
you got to.

480
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,043
The last bad outbreak
in the United States,

481
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:23,614
the government had to kill
over 77,000 head of cattle,

482
00:29:23,657 --> 00:29:25,090
plus that many sheep and goats.

483
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,252
Even 20,000 deer.

484
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:29,524
lt's a terrible thing.

485
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:33,499
l just bought me 20 head
of Mexican cows down South.

486
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:35,695
Could they be the bad ones?

487
00:29:35,736 --> 00:29:37,226
Uh, could be.

488
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:38,898
lf there were, you're going
to have to get rid

489
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:40,964
of every cow that's been
in contact with them.

490
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:46,072
Well, you're talking about
all the animals l own.

491
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:50,210
l know l am.

492
00:29:50,251 --> 00:29:51,548
l hope l'm wrong.

493
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:54,486
l hope it turns out
to be something else,

494
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,354
so we won't ever have
to talk about it again.

495
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:06,129
Looks like l landed in
the wrong place again.

496
00:30:07,468 --> 00:30:09,527
Uh, you guys get on.
There's some fence to fix.

497
00:30:24,952 --> 00:30:26,886
Yeah, how 'bout that?

498
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:31,847
You going to let them
shoot your cows

499
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:32,859
out from underneath you

500
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:35,384
on account of a
schoolbook disease?

501
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:38,124
You getting that old, Homer?

502
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:42,499
l wonder if a long quarantine
wouldn't satisfy him.

503
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,867
You think they'd agree to that?

504
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:45,633
Yeah, they don't have
to agree to nothing--

505
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:47,038
they're the law.

506
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:49,065
You can agree with them
till hell freezes over

507
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,542
for all the good
it'll do you.

508
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:53,740
Yeah, but that Mr. Burris
seemed like a reasonable man.

509
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:58,246
You think they'd come in here
and liquidate?

510
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:01,652
Hell, yeah, they'll liquidate,
you got what they say you got.

511
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,020
Now, you look a-here.

512
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:06,322
You've had 24 of my 34 years
working for you on this ranch,

513
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,693
and, Daddy, you have had
top-grade cheap labor.

514
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,664
l shoveled manure
out of barns for you.

515
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:13,997
You got my calluses, for what?

516
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,093
Your blessings the day you die?

517
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:18,331
Now, damn it, l want
out of this spread

518
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:21,830
what l put into it.

519
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,105
Well, you got a proposal
to make to me, Hud?

520
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:25,805
You get on the
telephone tonight

521
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:27,108
and sell every breed cow
you own.

522
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:29,047
They haven't got
a chain on you yet.

523
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:33,879
Would that be your way
to getting out of a tight?

524
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,218
Well, l can ship
the whole herd out

525
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:36,517
before they begin the test.

526
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:41,392
You mean, try and pass
bad stuff off on my neighbors,

527
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:43,360
who wouldn't even know
what they was getting?

528
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:46,389
Eh, you don't know
it's bad stuff.

529
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,967
Aw, ship them out of state,

530
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,764
unload them up north
before the news gets out.

531
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:52,237
And take a chance
on starting an epidemic

532
00:31:52,272 --> 00:31:54,172
in the entire country.

533
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,676
Why, this whole country
is run on epidemics!

534
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,701
Where you been?

535
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:00,077
Epidemics are big business--

536
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:02,275
price-fixing,
crooked TV shows,

537
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:05,649
income tax finagling,
souped up expense accounts.

538
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:07,677
How many honest men you know?

539
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:11,151
You take the sinners
away from the saints,

540
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:13,284
you're lucky to end up
with Abraham Lincoln.

541
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:14,794
So l say, let's us
put our bread

542
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:17,763
in some of that gravy
while it is still hot.

543
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:25,760
You're an unprincipled man, Hud.

544
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:33,878
Well, don't let that fuss you.

545
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:36,508
l mean, you've got enough
for both of us.

546
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:50,622
This afternoon's
been a regular bitch.

547
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:52,386
You out of poop?

548
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:54,257
l'm just having a breather.

549
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:56,285
Well, why don't you go back
to the ranch

550
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,661
and grab yourself a nap?

551
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:03,459
No, l'll hold up my end of it.

552
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,233
Yeah, l guess you would.

553
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,809
Granddad!

554
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:53,509
Found your longhorns
out near ldia Ridge.

555
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:58,116
Government's going
to have a hard time

556
00:34:58,155 --> 00:35:00,055
trying to inspect 'em.

557
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,355
Those big horns'll never
go through a chute.

558
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:07,727
There ain't many left in the
country, are there, Granddad?

559
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:10,062
No, they're dying out.

560
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,627
l just keep 'em
for old time's sake.

561
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,070
Keep 'em to remind me
of how things was.

562
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:18,802
Everything we had
come from their hides--

563
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:23,745
our furniture, our ropes,
our-our clothes, our hats.

564
00:35:25,982 --> 00:35:30,510
Granddad...
let's turn 'em loose.

565
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:35,752
No, Lon, that wouldn't be
the thing to do.

566
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:39,421
They got to go along
with the rest.

567
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,677
Granddad.

568
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,153
Why, thank you, Lon.

569
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:07,554
l shouldn't have brought
you out here tonight,

570
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:09,081
not after the day you put in.

571
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,649
Oh, if the picture's any good,

572
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:13,254
l'll wake up,
don't you worry.

573
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,194
Looks like you're
the only one around here

574
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:24,503
who ain't got somebody
whose knee you can pinch.

575
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,873
Oh, l think
l can stand it.

576
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,573
You wouldn't think
they'd pay 65 cents

577
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:32,377
to come here and do it.

578
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:36,385
They can go up in
the hayloft for nothing.

579
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:49,057
Come on, you miners 49ers.

580
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:53,297
Let's all join in and sing
that old favorite, ''Clementine.''

581
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,964
Just follow the bouncing ball.

582
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:01,041
<i>Oh, my darling,</i>
<i>oh, my darling...</i>

583
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:04,342
<i>Oh, my darling Clementine</i>

584
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:07,282
<i>Thou are lost</i>
<i>and gone forever</i>

585
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:10,286
<i>Dreadful sorry, Clementine</i>

586
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,949
<i>ln the cavern, in the canyon</i>

587
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,891
<i>Excavating for a mine</i>

588
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:20,327
<i>Dwelt a miner 49er</i>

589
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,355
<i>And his daughter, Clementine</i>

590
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,766
<i>Oh, my darling,</i>
<i>oh, my darling</i>

591
00:37:26,803 --> 00:37:29,931
<i>Oh, my darling, Clementine</i>

592
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:33,170
<i>Thou art lost</i>
<i>and gone forever</i>

593
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,406
<i>Dreadful sorry, Clementine.</i>

594
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:18,237
You going to get your
mouth around all that?

595
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:19,978
Going to try.

596
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:30,219
Hi, Hud.

597
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:31,422
How are you, sport?

598
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,192
ls that Truman Peters'
wife with Hud?

599
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:40,329
l think so.

600
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,238
Want me to call him over?

601
00:38:44,276 --> 00:38:46,767
No, no, just leave him
to his own business.

602
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,779
Got a half a buck?

603
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:02,182
Okay, come on on back.

604
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:04,923
Aren't you going to
give me the change?

605
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:08,021
Hey, hey.

606
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:10,557
Well, let's make
a party out of this.

607
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:13,093
Daddy, this not
too natural blonde here

608
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:14,571
is Mrs. Truman Peters.

609
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:15,903
How do you do?

610
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:17,067
How do you do,
Mr. Bannon?

611
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:18,769
''Wild Horse''
Homer Bannon, Lily.

612
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,675
That's what
he used to be known as.

613
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:23,647
And this kind of gangly youth
over there is my nephew Lon.

614
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:34,525
You may have just noticed,

615
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,427
but my daddy hasn't asked us
to sit down.

616
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,658
That's 'cause he doesn't
want to socialize with me.

617
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:43,259
He's a little fussy
about the company he keeps.

618
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:45,701
Yeah, you're
a married woman, Lily.

619
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:48,638
That doesn't go down
very well with him.

620
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:51,233
He's a man of high principals
and what have you.

621
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:52,937
He doesn't believe in any
loose living at all.

622
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:54,138
lsn't that right, Homer?

623
00:39:55,213 --> 00:39:56,407
Granddad.

624
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,047
Hey, Homer, you okay?

625
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:01,348
Get me...
get me home, boy.

626
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,288
Roll down that window
a little, will you, Hud?

627
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:19,966
Ah, that's good.

628
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:23,463
The place back there seemed
a little short of air.

629
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:24,634
Maybe you just got

630
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:26,405
a little too
much sun today.

631
00:40:26,444 --> 00:40:29,072
Well, whatever.

632
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:33,483
No need to pose
such a long face about it.

633
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:35,576
l feel better now.

634
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,746
When we get home,

635
00:40:36,788 --> 00:40:38,585
l'm going to fix you
some salipadicha.

636
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:42,992
Yeah, yeah, that'll
settle me right down.

637
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,998
He dropped right off.

638
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,764
He's beginning to look

639
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:55,830
kind of worn out, isn't he?

640
00:40:55,874 --> 00:41:00,834
Sometimes l forget
how old he is.

641
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:03,109
l guess l just don't
want to think about it.

642
00:41:03,148 --> 00:41:04,945
Time you started.

643
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:09,780
Well, l know he's
gonna die someday.

644
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:11,982
l know that much.

645
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:13,786
He is.

646
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:18,387
Makes me feel like somebody
dumped me into a cold river.

647
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,455
Happens to everybody.

648
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:22,397
Horses, dogs, men.

649
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:27,736
Nobody gets out of life alive.

650
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:44,612
l'll give you
a hand upstairs.

651
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:46,487
Lon'll take care of me.

652
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:48,456
Suit yourself.

653
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:50,984
Good night, Hud.

654
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,461
Thanks for the game, boys.

655
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:09,030
You can have another
shot at me next payday.

656
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:52,415
You got a cigarette?

657
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:54,043
Yeah.

658
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:56,911
Then l wish you wouldn't keep me

659
00:42:56,955 --> 00:42:58,513
hanging around
on the front porch.

660
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,524
Makes me feel
like l'm selling something.

661
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:02,617
All right, come on in.

662
00:43:04,963 --> 00:43:06,453
They're a little squashed.

663
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:08,533
lt's all right, they'll do.

664
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:13,463
Well, l see you got
things fixed up some.

665
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:14,938
l try.

666
00:43:14,973 --> 00:43:16,463
Looks pretty good.

667
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:19,203
Except your sweet potato plant
over here has got the blight.

668
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:21,178
l can't seem
to get one started.

669
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:23,704
Well, they need a lot of
tender loving care, honey.

670
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:24,943
Same as the rest of us.

671
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:26,348
l'll keep it in mind.

672
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:28,046
Could l have a match?

673
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:35,393
Well, what do we got here?

674
00:43:35,427 --> 00:43:37,987
''Jiffy...

675
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,498
portable hair dyer.''

676
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:45,864
''...triple screen.''

677
00:43:45,904 --> 00:43:47,496
Hmm.

678
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:49,164
Automatic toaster.

679
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:53,342
What have you been doing?

680
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:55,938
A little rustling down
at the five and dime?

681
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:57,505
l go in for
those prize contests.

682
00:43:57,616 --> 00:43:59,846
''How Shiny Shampoo
changed my life,

683
00:43:59,885 --> 00:44:01,147
in 20 words or less.''

684
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:03,814
You know, they give free
two-week trips to Europe.

685
00:44:03,855 --> 00:44:05,880
But l end up with
the fountain pens

686
00:44:05,924 --> 00:44:07,653
and the Japanese binoculars.

687
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:10,126
Yeah, won me
a turkey raffle once,

688
00:44:10,162 --> 00:44:11,459
but it was fixed.

689
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:13,087
l got to be pretty
friendly with one

690
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:14,462
of 'em gals picking
the numbers.

691
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:16,397
lt figures.

692
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:19,598
How much you take
the boys for tonight?

693
00:44:19,638 --> 00:44:22,835
20 dollars
and some change.

694
00:44:22,874 --> 00:44:25,001
You're a dangerous
woman to have around.

695
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:26,840
l'm a good poker player.

696
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:28,709
You're a good housekeeper.

697
00:44:28,747 --> 00:44:32,148
You're a good cook,
you're a good laundress.

698
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:34,675
What else you good at?

699
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,286
At taking care of myself.

700
00:44:38,323 --> 00:44:41,087
You shouldn't have to,
a woman looks like you do.

701
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:44,653
Oh, that's what
my ex-husband used to tell me...

702
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:47,460
before he took my wallet
and my gasoline credit card

703
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:49,626
and left me stranded
in a downtown motel

704
00:44:49,668 --> 00:44:51,135
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

705
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:54,036
What'd you do
to make him take to the hills?

706
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:56,563
You wear your curlers to bed
or something?

707
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:00,304
Ed's a gambler.

708
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:02,905
He's probably up at Vegas
or Reno right now,

709
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:03,972
dealing at night,

710
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:06,848
losing it all back
in the daytime.

711
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:09,649
Oh, well, a man like that
sounds no better than a heel.

712
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:12,613
Aren't you all?

713
00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:15,182
Honey, don't go shooting
all the dogs

714
00:45:15,227 --> 00:45:17,422
'cause one of them's got fleas.

715
00:45:17,462 --> 00:45:20,625
l was married to Ed
for six years.

716
00:45:20,665 --> 00:45:22,132
Only thing he was ever good for

717
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:24,294
was to scratch my back
where l couldn't reach it.

718
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:27,732
You still got that itch?

719
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:31,299
Off and on.

720
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:36,647
Well, let me know
when it gets to botherin' you.

721
00:45:57,669 --> 00:45:57,777
Hep, hep, hep, hep, hep!

722
00:45:57,777 --> 00:46:00,211
Hep, hep, hep, hep, hep!

723
00:46:02,282 --> 00:46:05,149
Ya! Giddy! Ya! Ya!

724
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:07,585
Ya! Giddy! Ya!

725
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,457
Ya! Hep, hep, hep, hep!

726
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,120
Hep, hep! Ho!

727
00:46:19,899 --> 00:46:21,833
Now, what we're doing,
Mr. Bannon,

728
00:46:21,868 --> 00:46:23,836
is injecting
these cows and horses

729
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,202
with specimens that are
taken from your herd.

730
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:27,365
ln three to six days,

731
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:29,807
we should know
what we want to know.

732
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:36,214
Ya!

733
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:37,477
Move on in there!

734
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:38,983
Get in that chute!

735
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:40,849
Move on in there!

736
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:45,718
Ah-ha-ha-ha! Hey!

737
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:46,986
Ho!

738
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:48,926
Go over there!
Ya!

739
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:53,864
You all right, Lon?

740
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,299
She...

741
00:46:55,335 --> 00:46:58,395
she kicked you into the fence.

742
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:00,702
You skinned your head a little.

743
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,867
Boy, you caught a lick!

744
00:47:02,909 --> 00:47:03,933
Better get back to work.

745
00:47:03,977 --> 00:47:05,444
Boys'll be on you for a week,

746
00:47:05,478 --> 00:47:07,343
you quit 'cause you dented
your head a little.

747
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,041
No need to rush him.

748
00:47:09,082 --> 00:47:11,016
You all right, Lon?

749
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,211
Mm...

750
00:47:15,655 --> 00:47:17,020
Whoa!

751
00:47:17,056 --> 00:47:18,819
Oh, you've had it, fantan.

752
00:47:18,858 --> 00:47:21,019
Now, get him to bed.

753
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:30,102
All right, Jack, back to work.

754
00:47:34,507 --> 00:47:37,408
You know, all this time,
l thought you were skinny!

755
00:47:37,443 --> 00:47:39,070
You weigh a ton.

756
00:47:39,112 --> 00:47:41,580
Can't seem to get
my head on straight.

757
00:47:41,614 --> 00:47:42,945
Get in there, cow.

758
00:47:42,982 --> 00:47:44,973
Hud, l think l'm going
to lose my breakfast.

759
00:47:45,018 --> 00:47:46,212
Not over me, you ain't.

760
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:48,049
You hold your fire
till we get to the house.

761
00:47:56,262 --> 00:47:58,662
Sugar, you're white as a sheet.

762
00:47:58,698 --> 00:48:00,495
Alma, you're getting flour
all over me.

763
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:01,864
What happened?

764
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,801
Ah, one of the cows
cuddled up to him.

765
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:05,269
- Ow!
- Shouldn't a doctor look at him?

766
00:48:05,305 --> 00:48:06,636
Pay five bucks

767
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:08,334
and some iodine and aspirin,
he'll mend.

768
00:48:19,452 --> 00:48:21,283
Well, that's about
as far as l go.

769
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:22,845
l draw the line at bedpans.

770
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:24,220
Thanks, Hud.

771
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:26,282
You can goldbrick
for the rest of the day.

772
00:48:26,326 --> 00:48:28,191
Just don't try
to stretch it into two.

773
00:48:41,574 --> 00:48:44,771
Here, let's get those boots off.

774
00:48:51,317 --> 00:48:53,080
Cold lemonade.

775
00:49:03,496 --> 00:49:04,929
Here.

776
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:06,124
Oh, come on.

777
00:49:06,165 --> 00:49:08,656
They're only lemon seeds.

778
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:17,402
Mmm.

779
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:21,643
That better?

780
00:49:22,749 --> 00:49:24,273
You ought to doze off now.

781
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:31,090
Gee, Alma, you're cool.

782
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:33,058
You smell of lemon.

783
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,318
Alma?

784
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:37,727
What is it, sugar?

785
00:49:37,764 --> 00:49:39,231
You're really beautiful.

786
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:40,596
Oh, sure l am.

787
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:42,897
You're one of the best
people there ever was.

788
00:49:42,935 --> 00:49:44,800
You're good to me, Alma.

789
00:49:44,837 --> 00:49:46,737
ln fact, you're good, period.

790
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:49,606
You be good, too.
Get some sleep.

791
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:27,964
Morning, Granddad.

792
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:30,498
Well, how are you today,
Lonnie?

793
00:51:30,543 --> 00:51:31,840
Good, real good.

794
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,505
Boy, have l been
sawing wood up there.

795
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:35,137
Looks like l slept
'round the clock.

796
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:36,842
You know, l feel
almost like working,

797
00:51:36,883 --> 00:51:37,850
for a change!

798
00:51:37,884 --> 00:51:39,181
Well, what do
you got for me?

799
00:51:39,218 --> 00:51:41,516
Patch a little fence?

800
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:43,522
Pull up some weeds?

801
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:45,387
Work a few calves?

802
00:51:45,424 --> 00:51:48,291
Well, l don't guess
we'll do anything much.

803
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:50,693
l don't see any sense
in wasting work

804
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,857
until l find out
about my cattle.

805
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:54,696
You bet.

806
00:51:54,734 --> 00:51:57,259
Yeah, we're just gonna
roll over and play dead

807
00:51:57,303 --> 00:51:59,362
and let 'em shovel dirt
in our faces.

808
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:01,873
lf l don't get
a clean bill of health

809
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:04,399
on my cattle,
we are just about dead.

810
00:52:04,443 --> 00:52:06,570
Dead broke.

811
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:09,080
We've been breeding
and crossbreeding this beef

812
00:52:09,115 --> 00:52:11,982
all our lives to get us
the best stock in the country.

813
00:52:12,018 --> 00:52:13,576
We're going to end up
with the government

814
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,246
paying us four bits
on the dollar for 'em.

815
00:52:15,288 --> 00:52:16,653
Poor but honest.

816
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:17,917
That's us.

817
00:52:17,957 --> 00:52:19,481
Well, we ain't sure
of anything yet.

818
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:21,618
We're just gonna have
to sit and wait it out.

819
00:52:21,661 --> 00:52:24,255
Don't get sores on
your butt doing it.

820
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:57,790
l can do without
that noise, Lon.

821
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:03,898
Now, go stretch your legs
a little, will ya?

822
00:53:54,186 --> 00:53:56,279
Well, where's that bottle?

823
00:53:56,322 --> 00:53:58,517
Had myself a bottle
of Jack Daniel's

824
00:53:58,557 --> 00:54:00,457
stashed in that
cupboard in there.

825
00:54:00,493 --> 00:54:01,619
You drank it.

826
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:02,719
When?

827
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:04,821
lnstead of dinner,
Wednesday night.

828
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:08,461
Don't remember.

829
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:10,729
lf you think l've
been nipping at it,

830
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,034
l don't drink anything
but Tokay wine.

831
00:54:13,072 --> 00:54:15,597
Yeah, l bet you keep
your little finger crooked

832
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:17,268
while you're doing it.

833
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,471
Well, why don't you
go stick your head

834
00:54:19,545 --> 00:54:22,139
in the water trough
and sober up for lunch?

835
00:54:23,749 --> 00:54:26,343
Now don't you find me
in control of myself?

836
00:54:26,385 --> 00:54:29,081
Hate to see you walk
a straight line.

837
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:31,646
That's easy.

838
00:54:38,197 --> 00:54:40,757
l don't like setting passes.

839
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,291
We'll ease into it, then.

840
00:54:43,336 --> 00:54:45,827
There's another one
coming up on your right.

841
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:48,101
Don't you ever ask?

842
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,506
Well, the only question
l ever ask any woman

843
00:54:50,543 --> 00:54:52,977
is, ''What time is your
husband coming home?''

844
00:54:53,012 --> 00:54:55,242
What's keeping you?

845
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:57,010
You're over the age
of consent, ain't you?

846
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:58,311
Way over.

847
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:00,785
Let's get our shoelaces
untied, what do you say?

848
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,014
l'd say l've been asked

849
00:55:02,054 --> 00:55:04,045
with a little more
finesse in my time.

850
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,467
Yeah...

851
00:55:22,575 --> 00:55:24,668
Hmm?

852
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,373
l wouldn't want
to come on crude. No, ma'am.

853
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,042
l'll bring you a
two-pound box of candy,

854
00:55:33,085 --> 00:55:36,248
maybe a bottle of perfume,
from the drugstore.

855
00:55:36,288 --> 00:55:38,882
How 'bout some colored
beads and wampum?

856
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:45,659
Whatever it takes
to make you trade 'em.

857
00:55:45,698 --> 00:55:48,496
No, thanks.

858
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:53,028
l've done my time with
one cold-blooded bastard.

859
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:54,869
l'm not looking for another.

860
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:59,567
lt's too late, honey,
you already found him.

861
00:56:13,923 --> 00:56:16,483
You hardly touched your plate,
Mr. Bannon.

862
00:56:16,592 --> 00:56:18,890
Nothing to do
with your cooking, Alma.

863
00:56:18,928 --> 00:56:20,725
l just ain't very hungry.

864
00:56:20,763 --> 00:56:22,128
Hear anything from the vets?

865
00:56:22,164 --> 00:56:23,131
No.

866
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:25,895
They're taking their own
sweet time about it.

867
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:28,301
Well, l ain't going to sit
around here and stew.

868
00:56:28,337 --> 00:56:29,964
Kiwanis are waiting
for me.

869
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:32,496
You gonna be in that pig
scramble tonight, Hud?

870
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:33,973
Yup, see if l can make

871
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:36,170
the Bannons
look good for a change.

872
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:41,009
You honchos want to come on in,

873
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,416
there's plenty of room
in the cheering section.

874
00:56:43,452 --> 00:56:45,818
They're letting ladies
in free tonight, Alma.

875
00:56:45,855 --> 00:56:47,413
You just might qualify.

876
00:56:58,734 --> 00:57:00,099
Hey, you know,
that's the first time

877
00:57:00,135 --> 00:57:02,103
Hud ever asked me to go
anyplace in his whole life.

878
00:57:02,137 --> 00:57:04,105
l wonder why he did that.

879
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:05,572
Lonesome, l imagine.

880
00:57:05,608 --> 00:57:07,599
Just trying to scare up
a little company.

881
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:09,110
Hud, lonesome?

882
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:11,169
He can get more women comin'
than anybody else around.

883
00:57:11,213 --> 00:57:12,976
Well, that ain't
necessarily much.

884
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:14,880
They ain't necessarily company,
neither.

885
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:16,441
Women just like to be around

886
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:19,147
something dangerous
part of the time.

887
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:21,816
Even Hud can get lonesome

888
00:57:21,857 --> 00:57:23,484
once in a while.

889
00:57:23,526 --> 00:57:27,223
Well, l wouldn't mind watching
him chase those squealers.

890
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:33,033
Well, then, we'll go on in.

891
00:57:33,068 --> 00:57:36,196
l'll stay home.
l don't like pigs.

892
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:05,562
Now let's give these kids
a hand.

893
00:58:05,601 --> 00:58:08,297
Now, applaud for the kid
that you like the best.

894
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:19,404
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.

895
00:58:19,448 --> 00:58:21,279
Looks like number ten won it.

896
00:58:21,317 --> 00:58:24,377
All right, now you've all seen
one kind of twistin'.

897
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,910
You're about to see
another kind.

898
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:29,118
We've got ten able-bodied men
going to tie themselves in knots

899
00:58:29,158 --> 00:58:31,626
trying to catch ten
of the fastest greased pigs

900
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,218
you've ever seen in your life.

901
00:58:33,262 --> 00:58:34,695
Now the first man
that catches his pig

902
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,493
and brings it back
to this little square here

903
00:58:36,532 --> 00:58:38,693
in front of the judges stand
is going to be the winner.

904
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:41,567
Now if you boys'll come on in,
we'll get this started, come on.

905
00:58:47,443 --> 00:58:49,707
You guys got the pigs
ready down there, Marlon?

906
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:50,871
You bet!

907
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:52,210
Okay.

908
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:53,373
Let's go then.

909
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:55,178
Come on, let's go there.

910
00:59:00,356 --> 00:59:03,223
Arnold, you're outside there.
Step in, will ya?

911
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:04,816
Hey, Wag, pull your hat off,
will ya?

912
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,054
Let's go.

913
00:59:12,835 --> 00:59:15,668
All right, boys, now when
l say ''three,'' we'll go.

914
00:59:15,704 --> 00:59:18,229
One, two, three-- go!

915
00:59:18,273 --> 00:59:20,605
Off they go.
Look at them go.

916
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:19,866
Well, it looks like
we got a winner-- Hud Bannon.

917
01:00:19,902 --> 01:00:22,598
Hud, that pig looks
about as dirty as you do.

918
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:25,633
Towel back there?

919
01:00:25,674 --> 01:00:27,471
Folks, we sure do thank you
for turning out tonight,

920
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:28,874
and we hope
you enjoyed yourself.

921
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:29,878
Whew!

922
01:00:29,912 --> 01:00:31,379
We look forward
to seeing you next year

923
01:00:31,413 --> 01:00:32,710
at the annual cotton festival.

924
01:00:32,748 --> 01:00:34,045
Nice goin'.

925
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:37,644
Wish l could still get around
the way you do, Hud.

926
01:00:37,686 --> 01:00:40,177
Boy, you sure do
churn up that dust.

927
01:00:40,222 --> 01:00:41,211
Well, l'm going to kick up

928
01:00:41,256 --> 01:00:43,019
a little more dust
before the night's over.

929
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:44,719
Anybody interested?

930
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,820
Well, that's enough excitement
for me, l guess.

931
01:00:47,863 --> 01:00:50,195
l'll be getting back.
Lon?

932
01:00:50,232 --> 01:00:52,223
Oh, l don't know.
lt's still kind of early.

933
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:55,896
l might just stick around
with Hud for a while.

934
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:58,065
Well, l'll leave
the door open for you.

935
01:00:58,107 --> 01:00:59,472
Yeah.

936
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:05,070
Hitch up your pants, fantan.

937
01:01:05,114 --> 01:01:07,105
l'm going to get cleaned up,
then l'll buy you a drink.

938
01:01:11,383 --> 01:01:13,647
You want to put
a little kick in that?

939
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:15,847
Sure, okay.

940
01:01:17,856 --> 01:01:19,881
Come on, l can handle it.

941
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,053
Whoa, whoa.

942
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:44,675
Kind of pretty girl.

943
01:01:44,717 --> 01:01:46,582
Don't let me cramp you.

944
01:01:46,652 --> 01:01:48,711
Oh, l wouldn't make
any kind of move at her.

945
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:49,846
Why not?

946
01:01:49,888 --> 01:01:51,947
You ain't
nailed down, are you?

947
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,855
Well, that's what l call
a woman and a half.

948
01:01:53,892 --> 01:01:56,793
You're a pretty
good-looking kid.

949
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:58,387
You dab down that cowlick

950
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,591
and button your collar
up over your Adam's apple,

951
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,430
you... you might
just make out.

952
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:07,530
l wouldn't mind driving her
the long way home.

953
01:02:07,573 --> 01:02:09,768
Well, you ought to
take a crack at that.

954
01:02:09,808 --> 01:02:12,538
Get all the good
you can out of 1 7,

955
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:15,307
'cause it sure wears out
in one hell of a hurry.

956
01:02:15,347 --> 01:02:18,407
Ah, my trouble is
l got to like a girl a lot

957
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,350
before l can work up
to anything.

958
01:02:20,386 --> 01:02:22,786
l mean,
like her as a person.

959
01:02:22,821 --> 01:02:24,948
Honcho, you're
a regular idealist.

960
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,981
And what's wrong with that?

961
01:02:27,025 --> 01:02:29,425
l don't know, l just
ain't never tried it.

962
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:31,361
Well...

963
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:33,297
suppose you think
l'm a jerk.

964
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,822
What do you care
what l think?

965
01:02:37,736 --> 01:02:40,933
Ah, this is probably going
to hand you a big laugh...

966
01:02:42,274 --> 01:02:44,174
...but l do.

967
01:02:47,846 --> 01:02:49,404
You have another little drink,

968
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:51,780
and l'll have
another little drink,

969
01:02:51,817 --> 01:02:53,910
and then maybe
we can work up

970
01:02:53,952 --> 01:02:56,250
some real family
feeling here.

971
01:02:58,123 --> 01:03:00,819
Well, l think l'll...

972
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:03,953
shove some change
in that juke.

973
01:03:31,523 --> 01:03:32,683
Hi.

974
01:03:32,724 --> 01:03:34,555
What are you gawking at?

975
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:36,151
Well, l ain't gawking.

976
01:03:36,195 --> 01:03:38,993
l don't like fresh kids.

977
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:41,465
Nobody's getting fresh,
mister, that l know about.

978
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,559
l think l'll take you
out in the alley

979
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:45,569
and jar
some of your teeth loose.

980
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:49,233
Are you having words with this
youngster about something?

981
01:03:49,274 --> 01:03:51,401
l'm about to put him
into the hospital.

982
01:03:51,443 --> 01:03:53,070
ls that so?

983
01:03:53,111 --> 01:03:55,011
Why, has he been
bothering you?

984
01:03:55,047 --> 01:03:58,244
No. No,
he ain't bothering me.

985
01:03:58,283 --> 01:04:00,183
lt's her he's bothering.

986
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:01,413
Well, you didn't, uh,

987
01:04:01,453 --> 01:04:03,887
offer him any encouragement
by any chance,

988
01:04:03,922 --> 01:04:04,911
did you there, young lady?

989
01:04:04,957 --> 01:04:05,981
No.

990
01:04:06,024 --> 01:04:07,150
That's funny.

991
01:04:07,192 --> 01:04:09,023
l was sitting way over
on the other side of the room,

992
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:10,460
and l got
a little bit encouraged.

993
01:04:10,496 --> 01:04:12,828
Maybe it's the way you move
around inside that dress.

994
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,298
All right, smart guy,

995
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,698
l'll take you instead.

996
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:17,065
Oh, l don't want to be hoggish.

997
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:19,070
Lon, you want a piece of him?

998
01:04:52,604 --> 01:04:54,367
- Ah.
- Whoo!

999
01:04:54,406 --> 01:04:56,465
Whoo! Whoo!

1000
01:04:56,508 --> 01:04:59,170
Boy, that is what l call
one hell of a night.

1001
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:01,304
l can do that
about six times a week.

1002
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:03,143
Well, you don't win 'em all,
you know.

1003
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:04,307
Well, l would

1004
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:06,146
if you were backing me
all the time.

1005
01:05:06,184 --> 01:05:08,311
Hey, that'd make quite
a combination, wouldn't it?

1006
01:05:08,353 --> 01:05:10,014
Nobody'd ever mess
with the Bannons,

1007
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:11,852
that's for sure.

1008
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:13,517
Yeah, felt like old times there

1009
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:14,958
for a little while.

1010
01:05:14,993 --> 01:05:16,790
Your daddy and l
used to take them all

1011
01:05:16,828 --> 01:05:18,125
on a Saturday night.

1012
01:05:18,163 --> 01:05:20,222
Yeah, he must have been
a pretty good old boy.

1013
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:22,028
What, Norman?

1014
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:23,193
Yeah.

1015
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:24,202
He was the kind of guy--

1016
01:05:24,236 --> 01:05:25,828
he used to leave
his loose change

1017
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:27,031
just lying out on the bureau

1018
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:29,097
when l was a kid
so l could swipe some of it.

1019
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:31,541
Let me take a girl away from him
once in a while

1020
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,738
like l done it on my own.

1021
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:36,212
He was bigger than you,
all right.

1022
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:37,306
He had a bigger wallet,

1023
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:38,543
but l'll tell
you something.

1024
01:05:38,584 --> 01:05:40,415
When you ain't being
a pain in the tail,

1025
01:05:40,452 --> 01:05:41,714
you remind me a lot of him.

1026
01:05:41,753 --> 01:05:43,482
- l do?
- Yeah, you sure do.

1027
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,648
Well, then how come

1028
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,715
you and me don't hit it off
so good?

1029
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:48,453
l got short arms.

1030
01:05:51,663 --> 01:05:54,257
Hell, there ain't never been
anybody like old Norman,

1031
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:56,096
never will be.

1032
01:05:56,134 --> 01:05:57,761
He was one-way-out boy.

1033
01:05:57,803 --> 01:06:00,033
Claimed he could hear
the grass grow.

1034
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,830
He got me to go
down to this pasture

1035
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:04,637
one night to listen.

1036
01:06:04,676 --> 01:06:05,802
After three or four hours

1037
01:06:05,844 --> 01:06:07,311
of just nipping
away at that bottle

1038
01:06:07,346 --> 01:06:08,745
to keep the dew off of us,

1039
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:11,806
l swore l could hear it, too.

1040
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:19,322
That's the night
l wracked up the car.

1041
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:23,658
Piled up
on Sampson Creek Bridge.

1042
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:27,993
He died in a half an hour.

1043
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:31,400
l didn't even have a mark on me.

1044
01:06:34,106 --> 01:06:35,300
Yeah, l wonder

1045
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,808
if your daddy's
hearing the grass now,

1046
01:06:37,843 --> 01:06:40,607
growing up over his grave.

1047
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:48,143
That story ought
to cool you off some.

1048
01:06:48,186 --> 01:06:49,517
lt doesn't.

1049
01:06:54,493 --> 01:06:57,223
Fantan, either
you're softhearted,

1050
01:06:57,262 --> 01:06:58,388
or softheaded.

1051
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,728
l don't know which.

1052
01:07:10,075 --> 01:07:12,509
<i>Oh, it was sad, dear Lord</i>

1053
01:07:12,577 --> 01:07:14,511

<i>Husbands and wives</i>

1057
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:22,049

1059
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:27,919
<i>Oh, it was sad, dear Lord</i>

01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,688
<i>lt was sad, dear Lord</i>

1061
01:07:29,728 --> 01:07:32,026
<i>lt was sad when the great ship</i>
<i>went down...</i>

1062
01:07:32,064 --> 01:07:33,622
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1063
01:07:33,665 --> 01:07:35,428
<i>Oh, it was shh,</i>
<i>dear Lord</i>

1064
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:37,196
<i>lt was shh, dear Lord</i>

1065
01:07:37,235 --> 01:07:38,725
<i>lt was shh...</i>

1066
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:40,431
Hey, Granddad.

1067
01:07:40,472 --> 01:07:42,633
All right, he's got you drunk.

1068
01:07:42,674 --> 01:07:44,767
What else has he given you
a taste for?

1069
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,742
All we had was a...

1070
01:07:46,878 --> 01:07:48,539
...couple of drinks is all.

1071
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,548
l don't remember
you being a teetotaler.

1072
01:07:50,615 --> 01:07:52,549
l drank. l don't object
to his having whiskey.

1073
01:07:52,584 --> 01:07:54,211
Well, something seems
to be eating away

1074
01:07:54,252 --> 01:07:55,219
at your liver.

1075
01:07:55,253 --> 01:07:56,743
You, Hud.

1076
01:07:56,788 --> 01:07:59,552
Like always.

1077
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:02,389
Hey, what are you
climbing on Hud for?

1078
01:08:02,427 --> 01:08:04,486
You think a lot of Hud,
do you?

1079
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:06,360
You think he's a real man.

1080
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:08,093
Well, you're being took in.

1081
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:09,361
You listen to him, honcho.

1082
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:10,925
He's my daddy, and he knows.

1083
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:12,766
l know you.

1084
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:13,998
You're smart.

1085
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:15,802
You got your share of guts.

1086
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,332
You can talk a man
into trusting you

1087
01:08:18,376 --> 01:08:20,071
and a woman into wanting you.

1088
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:21,443
Well, then,
l got it made, ain't l?

1089
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,640
To hear you tell it.

1090
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,342
Oh, why don't you get it off
your chest?

1091
01:08:24,382 --> 01:08:26,043
You've been griping
at me all this time

1092
01:08:26,084 --> 01:08:27,244
as what l done to Norman.

1093
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:29,412
You were drunk and careless
of your brother.

1094
01:08:29,454 --> 01:08:31,149
You had 15 years
to get over it.

1095
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:32,747
That's half of my life.

1096
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:35,123
That's not our quarrel
and never has been.

1097
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,752
Oh, the hell it isn't.

1098
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,524
No, boy.

1099
01:08:38,597 --> 01:08:42,795
l was sick of you
a long time before that.

1100
01:08:49,508 --> 01:08:52,739
Well...

1101
01:08:52,778 --> 01:08:55,144
isn't life full of surprises?

1102
01:08:56,681 --> 01:08:59,343
And all along
l thought it was...

1103
01:08:59,384 --> 01:09:01,409
'cause of what l'd done
to my big brother.

1104
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:06,254
l took that hard,
but l buried it.

1105
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:07,849
Well, all right, l'll bite.

1106
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:09,451
What turned you sour on me?

1107
01:09:09,494 --> 01:09:10,825
Not that l give a damn.

1108
01:09:10,862 --> 01:09:12,489
Just that, Hud.

1109
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:14,589
You don't give a damn.

1110
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:17,329
That's all.

1111
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:18,893
That's the whole of it.

1112
01:09:20,705 --> 01:09:23,833
You still don't get it, do you?

1113
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,139
You don't care
about people, Hud.

1114
01:09:26,178 --> 01:09:27,805
You don't give a damn
about 'em.

1115
01:09:27,846 --> 01:09:28,813
Granddad...

1116
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:31,042
Oh, you got all that charm
going for you,

1117
01:09:31,082 --> 01:09:34,313
and it makes the youngsters
want to be like you.

1118
01:09:34,352 --> 01:09:35,512
That's the shame of it.

1119
01:09:35,554 --> 01:09:37,749
'Cause you don't value nothing.

1120
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:39,757
You don't respect nothing.

1121
01:09:39,791 --> 01:09:43,420
You keep no check
on your appetites at all.

1122
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:45,793
You live just for yourself,

1123
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:49,096
and that makes you
not fit to live with.

1124
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:57,105
My mama loved me, but she died.

1125
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:06,807
Why pick on Hud, Granddad?

1126
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,554
He ain't the only one.

1127
01:10:10,655 --> 01:10:13,215
Just about everybody
around here is like him,

1128
01:10:13,258 --> 01:10:14,555
one way or another.

1129
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:17,118
Well, that's no cause
for rejoicing, is it?

1130
01:10:17,162 --> 01:10:21,189
Lonnie, little by little,
the look of the country changes

1131
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:23,963
because of the men we admire.

1132
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:26,766
l still think you
nailed him pretty hard.

1133
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:30,502
Did l?

1134
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:32,772
Maybe.

1135
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:37,111
Old people get as hard
as their arteries sometimes.

1136
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,013
You're just going to have

1137
01:10:42,053 --> 01:10:45,580
to make up your own mind
one day

1138
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:48,457
about what's right
and what's wrong.

1139
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:14,181
Where's that cotton-picking
housekeeper of ours?

1140
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,379
l want something to eat,

1141
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,479
and l don't want any
hesitating about it.

1142
01:11:17,522 --> 01:11:18,648
lt's late, Hud.

1143
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,816
She's asleep.

1144
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,189
Well, ain't that just keen?

1145
01:11:21,226 --> 01:11:24,821
Paying her good money to sleep,
and l'm starving to death.

1146
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,559
Well, maybe l can fry you up
an egg sandwich.

1147
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:29,567
Forget it.

1148
01:11:29,634 --> 01:11:30,896
Oh, get your butt
out of here.

1149
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:32,870
l can't think
with you standing around.

1150
01:11:32,904 --> 01:11:35,998
Knock some people on
their tails around here.

1151
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,441
You just might be one of 'em.

1152
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:40,808
Go on, get out of here!

1153
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:33,524
Whoa, there.

1154
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:35,051
Boy, they mean trouble.

1155
01:12:35,096 --> 01:12:37,690
Kind of wish l'd have stayed out
of bull riding.

1156
01:12:37,732 --> 01:12:39,097
Well, from the look of them,

1157
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:41,101
you ain't gonna be riding
very far.

1158
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:42,397
Well, thanks, buddy.

1159
01:12:42,437 --> 01:12:44,428
l better go check my gear.

1160
01:12:44,472 --> 01:12:45,598
Never mind your gear.

1161
01:12:45,673 --> 01:12:47,732
You ought to go check your head.

1162
01:12:50,278 --> 01:12:53,111
That bull's gonna eat you up.

1163
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:58,616
How are you, hotrod?

1164
01:12:58,686 --> 01:13:00,551
Hi, Hud.

1165
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:03,819
Got a good seat for the
show this afternoon?

1166
01:13:03,858 --> 01:13:06,691
They're getting two bucks
for those bleachers over there.

1167
01:13:09,464 --> 01:13:10,726
Be my guest.

1168
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:14,929
Well, this is ten dollars, Hud.

1169
01:13:14,969 --> 01:13:17,164
lt's good.
l didn't print it.

1170
01:13:17,205 --> 01:13:19,332
Well, thank you.

1171
01:13:22,243 --> 01:13:23,801
Stick with me, honcho.

1172
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:26,040
Your jeans will be
full of change.

1173
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,207
How come?

1174
01:13:28,249 --> 01:13:30,114
Well, l'll tell you.

1175
01:13:32,453 --> 01:13:34,444
l put on a clean, white shirt
this morning,

1176
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:36,081
and l saw me a lawyer.

1177
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:39,787
There's a law that says

1178
01:13:39,827 --> 01:13:42,728
when old folks can't
cut the mustard anymore,

1179
01:13:42,764 --> 01:13:46,791
you can make 'em let go,
whether they like it or not.

1180
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:51,966
What are you pulling
on Granddad now?

1181
01:13:52,006 --> 01:13:54,634
Something pretty raw, kid.

1182
01:13:56,344 --> 01:13:59,279
Yeah. lt sounds like it.

1183
01:14:00,648 --> 01:14:02,275
You take your dough.
l don't want it.

1184
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1185
01:14:04,118 --> 01:14:06,678
Don't look down your nose
at me, sonny boy.

1186
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:09,189
l'm gonna get old, too.

1187
01:14:09,223 --> 01:14:11,191
And l don't aim
to end up on county relief

1188
01:14:11,225 --> 01:14:14,422
with a bowl of soup
and two cigarettes a day,

1189
01:14:14,462 --> 01:14:16,430
if l behave myself.

1190
01:14:16,464 --> 01:14:17,658
l want what l worked for.

1191
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:19,667
l got a right to it.

1192
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:22,693
You know something,
honcho?

1193
01:14:22,737 --> 01:14:24,830
You don't look out
for yourself,

1194
01:14:24,872 --> 01:14:26,999
and the only helping hand
you'll ever get

1195
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,441
is when they lower the box.

1196
01:14:33,014 --> 01:14:35,278
Now you have fun,
you hear?

1197
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:49,193
Hud.

1198
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:51,858
You're up awful late.

1199
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:54,800
l got a lot on my mind.

1200
01:14:54,836 --> 01:14:56,303
Come on in.

1201
01:14:56,337 --> 01:14:58,430
Take a load off your feet.

1202
01:14:58,473 --> 01:14:59,599
Talked to the vets today?

1203
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,800
l talked to 'em,

1204
01:15:00,842 --> 01:15:03,106
but l didn't get a whole lot
of information out of 'em.

1205
01:15:03,144 --> 01:15:04,873
Yeah, you didn't expect to,
did you?

1206
01:15:04,912 --> 01:15:06,880
The government man wants you
to know something,

1207
01:15:06,914 --> 01:15:09,041
he'll call you
or send you a telegram.

1208
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:11,779
They said they was watching
the test animals pretty close,

1209
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:14,879
but they had nothing
showed up yet.

1210
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:18,351
Hud?

1211
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:19,724
Yes, sir.

1212
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:22,195
What's this tricky
deal you're up to?

1213
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:23,720
Lon tells me

1214
01:15:23,765 --> 01:15:27,565
you're gonna pull the
rug out from under me.

1215
01:15:27,602 --> 01:15:30,469
That's right.

1216
01:15:30,505 --> 01:15:33,963
l haven't got all
the rough edges ironed out yet,

1217
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:36,704
but l can give you an idea.

1218
01:15:36,744 --> 01:15:39,235
The main thing is you, old man.

1219
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,805
You're getting too old
to make the grade.

1220
01:15:41,849 --> 01:15:45,512
Whether they liquidate us or not
when this thing is over,

1221
01:15:45,553 --> 01:15:47,987
you just better get yourself
a rocking chair

1222
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:49,353
and get out of my way.

1223
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:51,585
What in the hell do you mean?

1224
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:53,719
When an old man goes off

1225
01:15:53,761 --> 01:15:56,787
and buys himself a bunch
of sick Mexican cows,

1226
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:58,856
it means he's over the hill.

1227
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,859
You got the incompetence,
Daddy,

1228
01:16:02,904 --> 01:16:06,237
and the hotrod's too young
to take things over.

1229
01:16:08,009 --> 01:16:09,203
Just might get the court

1230
01:16:09,243 --> 01:16:11,677
to appoint me guardian
of your property.

1231
01:16:11,712 --> 01:16:13,680
l don't know.

1232
01:16:13,714 --> 01:16:16,148
lf l don't get it one way,
l'm gonna get it another.

1233
01:16:18,186 --> 01:16:21,349
Well, you're badly
mistaken about all this.

1234
01:16:21,389 --> 01:16:23,448
l'll be the only one
to run this ranch

1235
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:24,981
while l'm above ground.

1236
01:16:25,026 --> 01:16:28,484
After that, you may
get part of it.

1237
01:16:28,529 --> 01:16:30,497
l don't know.

1238
01:16:30,531 --> 01:16:32,556
But you can't get
control of this place.

1239
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,467
No way in the world.

1240
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:38,404
Don't go making any bets
on that.

1241
01:16:40,775 --> 01:16:44,438
Maybe l treated you too hard.

1242
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:46,447
l don't doubt
l made some mistakes.

1243
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:48,312
A man don't always do
what's right.

1244
01:16:48,349 --> 01:16:52,786
Ah, Daddy,
you ain't never been wrong.

1245
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,584
Been handing out
the ten tablets of law

1246
01:16:55,656 --> 01:16:57,988
from whatever little hill
you could find to climb up on

1247
01:16:58,025 --> 01:16:59,993
since l was a kid.

1248
01:17:00,027 --> 01:17:02,291
Shape up or ship out.

1249
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:05,857
That's the way
you runs things around here.

1250
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,458
Wild-eyed Homer Bannon

1251
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:10,062
passing out
scripture and verse

1252
01:17:10,104 --> 01:17:12,231
like you wrote it yourself.

1253
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:19,536
So l just naturally
had to go bad

1254
01:17:19,647 --> 01:17:23,048
in the face of so much good.

1255
01:17:23,084 --> 01:17:27,521
Hud, how did a man
like you come to be a son to me?

1256
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:29,113
Well, that's easy.

1257
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:30,282
l wasn't

1258
01:17:30,324 --> 01:17:31,348
no bundle left

1259
01:17:31,392 --> 01:17:32,552
on your doorstep.

1260
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,150
Wasn't found in no bulrushes.

1261
01:17:34,195 --> 01:17:36,356
You've got the same feelings
below your belt

1262
01:17:36,397 --> 01:17:37,557
as any other man.

1263
01:17:37,598 --> 01:17:39,828
That's how you got stuck
with me for a son,

1264
01:17:39,867 --> 01:17:42,700
whether you like it or not.

1265
01:20:24,962 --> 01:20:27,328
He was just so drunk, Alma.

1266
01:20:29,767 --> 01:20:31,462
Did he hurt you?

1267
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:37,507
Should l take you to town,
get you a doctor?

1268
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,441
Go on out of here.

1269
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:05,863
Well, what are you looking at?

1270
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,268
l'm looking at you, Hud.

1271
01:21:07,304 --> 01:21:08,532
Oh, climb off it.

1272
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,234
You've been wanting to do
pretty much the same thing.

1273
01:21:11,275 --> 01:21:13,368
And wanting to wallow her
from the day she got here.

1274
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,344
Yeah, l been wanting
to do it.

1275
01:21:15,379 --> 01:21:17,779
But not mean like you.

1276
01:21:38,296 --> 01:21:40,423
Here comes Mr. Burris.

1277
01:21:45,937 --> 01:21:47,768
Good morning.

1278
01:21:47,805 --> 01:21:49,170
Good morning.

1279
01:21:50,608 --> 01:21:52,803
Your timing's off.
You missed breakfast.

1280
01:21:52,843 --> 01:21:56,244
Thanks, but l've eaten.

1281
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,475
l guess you got something
to tell us,

1282
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:00,507
or you wouldn't be here.

1283
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:03,281
l guess the tests are done.

1284
01:22:03,321 --> 01:22:04,788
Yes, sir, they're done.

1285
01:22:08,025 --> 01:22:09,583
You got the worst thing
you could have.

1286
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:19,227
And there's no cure
at all?

1287
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:21,067
None we know of.

1288
01:22:21,105 --> 01:22:22,333
lt's like a bolt of lightning--

1289
01:22:22,373 --> 01:22:25,137
it won't hurt you till it hits,
then it hurts a lot.

1290
01:22:25,176 --> 01:22:27,337
Your cows are
public enemies now.

1291
01:22:27,378 --> 01:22:28,402
You gotta handle
this thing fast

1292
01:22:28,446 --> 01:22:30,471
before it spreads.

1293
01:22:30,514 --> 01:22:32,243
Well, what do l do?

1294
01:22:32,283 --> 01:22:34,478
Just drive them into a pit
and shoot 'em?

1295
01:22:34,518 --> 01:22:36,315
l can't abide that.

1296
01:22:36,354 --> 01:22:38,185
l know it's a terrible
thing even to think about.

1297
01:22:38,222 --> 01:22:41,453
l've seen it
during the Depression.

1298
01:22:41,492 --> 01:22:44,359
lt's a sight worse to see
than it is to think about.

1299
01:22:44,395 --> 01:22:46,295
Look here, Mr. Bannon,
you're getting up in years.

1300
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:48,059
You can afford
to slow down.

1301
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:50,067
The rest won't hurt
your grass any.

1302
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:51,398
You might even sell
a few oil leases.

1303
01:22:51,435 --> 01:22:53,767
My daddy thinks that oil

1304
01:22:53,804 --> 01:22:55,829
is something you stick
in your salad dressing.

1305
01:22:57,308 --> 01:23:00,243
lf there's oil down there,
you can get it sucked up

1306
01:23:00,277 --> 01:23:02,438
after l'm under there with it.

1307
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,471
But l don't like it,
and l don't aim to have it.

1308
01:23:04,515 --> 01:23:06,881
There'll be no holes
punched in this land

1309
01:23:06,917 --> 01:23:08,407
while l'm here.

1310
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:10,613
They ain't going to come in
and grade no road

1311
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:13,383
so the wind
can blow me away.

1312
01:23:13,424 --> 01:23:14,482
That's all to me.

1313
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:20,453
What can l do with
a bunch of rotten oil wells?

1314
01:23:20,498 --> 01:23:24,059
l can't ride out every day
and prowl amongst them,

1315
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:26,865
like l can my cattle.

1316
01:23:26,904 --> 01:23:29,372
l can't breed them
or tend them or rope them

1317
01:23:29,407 --> 01:23:30,704
or chase them or nothing.

1318
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:34,839
l can't feel
a smidgen of pride in them.

1319
01:23:34,879 --> 01:23:36,540
'Cause they ain't
none of my doing.

1320
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,548
There's money in it.

1321
01:23:40,985 --> 01:23:43,476
l don't want that kind of money.

1322
01:23:43,521 --> 01:23:45,011
l want mine to come

1323
01:23:45,056 --> 01:23:48,025
from something that keeps a man
doing for himself.

1324
01:24:09,513 --> 01:24:13,415
We're much obliged to you for
coming out in person to tell us.

1325
01:27:25,809 --> 01:27:27,436
Start shootin'.

1326
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:57,622
Didn't take long.

1327
01:29:57,661 --> 01:30:00,755
lt don't take long
to kill things.

1328
01:30:00,798 --> 01:30:03,528
Not like it does to grow.

1329
01:31:01,558 --> 01:31:04,322
Well, there's
a couple we missed.

1330
01:31:04,361 --> 01:31:06,329
l'll get 'em.

1331
01:31:16,172 --> 01:31:18,766
Where do you think
you're going, mister?

1332
01:31:18,808 --> 01:31:20,139
To finish this job.

1333
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:21,404
Somebody needs to.

1334
01:31:21,444 --> 01:31:24,641
Well, you just close that gate.

1335
01:31:24,681 --> 01:31:26,774
l'll kill them two myself,

1336
01:31:26,816 --> 01:31:29,148
seeing as how l raised 'em.

1337
01:31:29,185 --> 01:31:31,483
Something wrong with you,
mister?

1338
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:34,513
There's no guarantee
you'll do it.

1339
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:36,548
He just said he would.

1340
01:31:39,162 --> 01:31:41,130
You get in the car.

1341
01:31:42,432 --> 01:31:44,423
We're going down and finish
buying those carcasses,

1342
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:46,196
and then we're leaving.

1343
01:31:49,005 --> 01:31:50,233
Mr. Bannon can handle
the rest of this

1344
01:31:50,273 --> 01:31:52,138
without us bothering him.

1345
01:31:54,644 --> 01:31:56,578
You just get along,
Mr. Burris.

1346
01:31:56,613 --> 01:32:00,674
l know none of this
here ain't your doing.

1347
01:32:00,784 --> 01:32:02,274
You see about the burying,

1348
01:32:02,318 --> 01:32:05,412
and then get that fellow
there off'n my ranch.

1349
01:32:07,557 --> 01:32:09,184
All l can say is l'm sorry.

1350
01:32:11,494 --> 01:32:13,394
l'm sure sorry.

1351
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:26,534
He ain't such a bad fella.

1352
01:32:26,576 --> 01:32:28,942
Just got a cruddy job.

1353
01:32:35,685 --> 01:32:37,619
Boys...

1354
01:32:37,654 --> 01:32:39,417
l don't plan to have any work

1355
01:32:39,456 --> 01:32:41,083
around here for some time.

1356
01:32:41,124 --> 01:32:45,720
l can't afford to keep you on
till things get better, so...

1357
01:32:49,165 --> 01:32:50,860
...l'll just have to let you go.

1358
01:33:00,276 --> 01:33:02,073
Give me the rifle.

1359
01:33:25,301 --> 01:33:28,964
Lord, but l've chased
'em longhorns many a mile.

1360
01:33:31,007 --> 01:33:32,907
l don't know
if l can kill 'em.

1361
01:33:36,012 --> 01:33:38,037
But l guess l can.

1362
01:33:39,983 --> 01:33:42,349
Guess this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you.

1363
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:46,245
Oh, l'll get over it,

1364
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:50,953
if my health don't
go to failing me.

1365
01:33:50,994 --> 01:33:53,656
Lon, you go away someplace.

1366
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,076
Well, them old bulls
are hard to kill.

1367
01:34:49,052 --> 01:34:51,486
Drag 'em away and bury 'em!

1368
01:34:51,521 --> 01:34:53,819
Bury 'em quick!

1369
01:34:53,857 --> 01:34:55,757
Go on!

1370
01:35:28,758 --> 01:35:31,386
Did you call
about the bus for me?

1371
01:35:32,729 --> 01:35:34,959
Yeah, it leaves at 10:26.

1372
01:35:34,998 --> 01:35:37,228
And can l buy my ticket on it?

1373
01:35:38,334 --> 01:35:40,768
Yeah. They said that'd be okay.

1374
01:35:51,514 --> 01:35:52,572
Alma?

1375
01:35:57,053 --> 01:35:58,782
l got $200 calf money,

1376
01:35:58,821 --> 01:36:01,517
- if you're short.
- You just keep it.

1377
01:36:03,793 --> 01:36:06,455
Well, l'm ready.

1378
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:41,623
Wish you weren't going
off and leaving us, Alma.

1379
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,389
You look after your grandpa.

1380
01:36:43,429 --> 01:36:46,193
He's getting old and feeble.
He's your job now.

1381
01:36:46,232 --> 01:36:48,962
We need you around here.

1382
01:36:49,001 --> 01:36:50,195
l sure do.

1383
01:36:52,137 --> 01:36:55,004
You'll get along just fine.

1384
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,770
l wish you'd stay.

1385
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:59,903
Well...

1386
01:36:59,945 --> 01:37:02,379
l been all over
this cow country,

1387
01:37:02,414 --> 01:37:03,779
looking for
the exact right place

1388
01:37:03,816 --> 01:37:06,216
and the exact right people,
so once l got stopped,

1389
01:37:06,252 --> 01:37:09,710
l wouldn't have
to be movin' again.

1390
01:37:09,755 --> 01:37:13,384
And it just hasn't worked out.

1391
01:37:13,425 --> 01:37:15,222
Good-bye, honey.

1392
01:37:15,261 --> 01:37:18,628
You take care of yourself.

1393
01:37:18,697 --> 01:37:21,222
Don't you be lazy, now.

1394
01:38:13,886 --> 01:38:15,410
How are you, Peewee?

1395
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:35,598
Looks like
we're losing a good cook.

1396
01:38:39,678 --> 01:38:42,044
Maybe we should, uh...

1397
01:38:42,081 --> 01:38:45,380
boosted your salary a little.

1398
01:38:45,417 --> 01:38:47,146
You ain't letting that
little ruckus we had

1399
01:38:47,186 --> 01:38:49,552
run you off, are you?

1400
01:38:49,588 --> 01:38:53,649
As far as l can get
on a bus ticket.

1401
01:38:53,692 --> 01:38:55,250
You saying that
l'm the first guy

1402
01:38:55,294 --> 01:38:57,159
that ever stuck his foot
in your door?

1403
01:38:58,364 --> 01:38:59,991
Oh, no.

1404
01:39:00,032 --> 01:39:02,592
The first one that
ever got rough, huh?

1405
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:07,936
Well, l'm sorry.

1406
01:39:07,973 --> 01:39:09,099
lt ain't my style.

1407
01:39:09,141 --> 01:39:11,268
l don't usually get
rough with my women.

1408
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,835
Generally don't have to.

1409
01:39:13,879 --> 01:39:16,109
You're rough on everybody.

1410
01:39:16,148 --> 01:39:18,241
So they tell me.

1411
01:39:18,283 --> 01:39:20,547
You want to know
something funny?

1412
01:39:20,586 --> 01:39:21,780
lt would have
happened eventually,

1413
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:23,481
without the roughhousin'.

1414
01:39:23,522 --> 01:39:26,389
You look pretty good
without your shirt on, you know.

1415
01:39:26,425 --> 01:39:27,858
Sight of that through
the kitchen window

1416
01:39:27,893 --> 01:39:30,862
made me put down
my dish towel more than once.

1417
01:39:30,896 --> 01:39:33,888
Well, why didn't
you speak up sooner?

1418
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:54,642
l'll remember you, honey.

1419
01:39:54,686 --> 01:39:57,450
You're the one that got away.

1420
01:40:37,959 --> 01:40:40,257
Come on, there, boy, git!

1421
01:40:58,813 --> 01:41:01,941
Stupid knucklehead,
what'd you hit the brakes for?

1422
01:41:01,983 --> 01:41:03,314
You got your life's work
in front of you

1423
01:41:03,351 --> 01:41:04,682
paying for this car.

1424
01:41:04,786 --> 01:41:06,185
Granddad's out here.

1425
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:08,849
He's crawling in the road!

1426
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:11,518
Grandad, what happened?

1427
01:41:11,559 --> 01:41:13,186
Are you hurt?

1428
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:17,995
l wanted to...
take a look around the place.

1429
01:41:18,032 --> 01:41:21,365
l fell off my horse.

1430
01:41:21,402 --> 01:41:23,029
This old man's
hurt pretty bad.

1431
01:41:23,071 --> 01:41:24,402
Let me up.

1432
01:41:24,439 --> 01:41:26,430
A man ain't to crawl.

1433
01:41:26,474 --> 01:41:27,702
Take it easy.

1434
01:41:27,775 --> 01:41:29,037
Lonnie, take my car,
get to the ranch,

1435
01:41:29,077 --> 01:41:31,011
call an ambulance,
tell 'em to get here quick.

1436
01:41:31,045 --> 01:41:33,513
And tell 'em we got
an awful sick man here.

1437
01:41:44,058 --> 01:41:45,821
lt won't start!

1438
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,725
All right, forget it.

1439
01:41:47,762 --> 01:41:49,389
Forget it!

1440
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:51,261
There's a bottle of whisky
in the dash.

1441
01:41:51,299 --> 01:41:52,459
Bring it over.

1442
01:41:58,373 --> 01:42:01,069
Come on, easy, easy, old man.

1443
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,441
Don't make me drink that stuff.

1444
01:42:09,484 --> 01:42:10,849
Lonnie, go on down
to the main road,

1445
01:42:10,885 --> 01:42:13,115
try to flag a car down,
get some help up here.

1446
01:42:13,154 --> 01:42:14,280
Go on, move.

1447
01:42:14,322 --> 01:42:16,688
Don't send him away, Hud.

1448
01:42:16,724 --> 01:42:18,817
l'm right here, Grandad,
don't you worry.

1449
01:42:21,062 --> 01:42:24,293
l feel kind of cold.

1450
01:42:24,332 --> 01:42:26,357
Everything's going
to be all right.

1451
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:32,931
l don't know
if l want it to be.

1452
01:42:32,974 --> 01:42:34,202
Don't talk like that.

1453
01:42:34,242 --> 01:42:35,903
You're going to be just fine.

1454
01:42:35,944 --> 01:42:38,538
l feel like...

1455
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:43,074
throwing in the sponge.

1456
01:42:43,117 --> 01:42:45,711
Like giving up.

1457
01:42:45,753 --> 01:42:48,779
You've never quit on anything
in your whole life.

1458
01:42:53,394 --> 01:42:58,627
Hud there is waiting on me...

1459
01:42:58,666 --> 01:43:02,966
and he ain't a patient man.

1460
01:43:28,196 --> 01:43:30,460
He isn't gone, is he?

1461
01:43:33,601 --> 01:43:35,068
Yeah.

1462
01:43:51,386 --> 01:43:52,353
l meant to buy him

1463
01:43:52,387 --> 01:43:56,517
a brand-new,
blanket-lined jacket...

1464
01:43:56,557 --> 01:43:58,889
and give it to him
sometime or other.

1465
01:44:04,899 --> 01:44:06,560
Lonnie...

1466
01:44:06,601 --> 01:44:07,590
Hey.

1467
01:44:10,138 --> 01:44:11,571
lt was the best thing.

1468
01:44:13,608 --> 01:44:15,735
Man, he was wore out,
and he knew it.

1469
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:19,079
He didn't seem so bad.

1470
01:44:21,215 --> 01:44:23,479
He didn't seem
so bad off at all.

1471
01:44:23,518 --> 01:44:25,076
Well, he was.

1472
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:27,314
Trying to get up,
hurting himself.

1473
01:44:30,558 --> 01:44:32,492
He couldn't have made it.

1474
01:44:32,527 --> 01:44:34,290
Lonnie,
any way in this world,

1475
01:44:34,328 --> 01:44:36,319
he couldn't have made it
another hour.

1476
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:41,362
He could if he had wanted to.

1477
01:44:43,438 --> 01:44:45,338
You fixed it so he
didn't want to anymore.

1478
01:44:58,086 --> 01:45:00,520
You don't know the whole story.

1479
01:45:03,391 --> 01:45:06,690
Yeah, him and me fought many
and many a round together.

1480
01:45:08,963 --> 01:45:10,624
But l guess you could say
that l helped him

1481
01:45:10,665 --> 01:45:12,826
about as much
as he ever helped me.

1482
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:18,500
How did you help him, Hud?

1483
01:45:19,807 --> 01:45:21,172
By trying to sell him out?

1484
01:45:21,209 --> 01:45:23,109
By taking the heart
out of him?

1485
01:45:23,144 --> 01:45:24,634
By making him
give up and quit?

1486
01:45:26,114 --> 01:45:27,411
ls that how you helped him?

1487
01:46:01,516 --> 01:46:05,247
He ain't in any
loaf-around eternal life.

1488
01:46:05,286 --> 01:46:07,379
He's the way he always was--

1489
01:46:07,421 --> 01:46:12,120
enjoying his good horses,
looking after the land,

1490
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,286
trying to figure out

1491
01:46:13,327 --> 01:46:15,818
ways to beat the dry
weather and wind.

1492
01:46:15,863 --> 01:46:17,592
You better settle down, boy.

1493
01:46:17,632 --> 01:46:19,361
You still got the graveyard
in front of you.

1494
01:46:21,669 --> 01:46:23,967
l know what
you're feeling, my boy,

1495
01:46:24,005 --> 01:46:28,169
but look at it this way--
he's gone to a better place.

1496
01:46:31,412 --> 01:46:33,209
l don't think so.

1497
01:46:35,216 --> 01:46:39,016
Not unless dirt is
a better place than air.

1498
01:48:09,228 --> 01:48:10,957
Well, we took him
to the graveyard

1499
01:48:10,997 --> 01:48:12,692
and put him down.

1500
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,564
lt's all over with now.

1501
01:48:28,648 --> 01:48:30,309
What have you got there?

1502
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:32,443
My gear.

1503
01:48:32,485 --> 01:48:35,045
You going someplace?

1504
01:48:35,088 --> 01:48:36,453
Yeah.

1505
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:43,695
Traveling kind of light,
ain't ya?

1506
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:47,427
Got everything l need.

1507
01:48:47,467 --> 01:48:50,300
Planning to go for good?

1508
01:48:50,336 --> 01:48:53,100
That's right.

1509
01:48:53,139 --> 01:48:57,235
What about your half
of the spread here?

1510
01:48:57,276 --> 01:49:00,040
Well, you can put
my share in the bank.

1511
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:03,742
l'm going somewhere else
and work for a while,

1512
01:49:03,783 --> 01:49:06,047
if l can happen
onto a job.

1513
01:49:06,085 --> 01:49:09,851
Ain't you a little bit green
to go cutting loose on your own?

1514
01:49:11,691 --> 01:49:13,682
Well, we'll see.

1515
01:49:15,928 --> 01:49:19,193
l was about your age
when l went in the army.

1516
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:23,259
Granddaddy had bought me a Mars
candy bar down at the station,

1517
01:49:23,302 --> 01:49:25,429
and he said to me,
''Character's the only thing

1518
01:49:25,471 --> 01:49:28,531
l got to give you
to be a man.''

1519
01:49:28,574 --> 01:49:30,667
Well, l guess he
was kind of worried.

1520
01:49:30,777 --> 01:49:34,873
You're trying so hard to
get out of the draft and all.

1521
01:49:36,082 --> 01:49:37,140
Honcho!

1522
01:49:44,057 --> 01:49:47,322
l just wanted you
to know that...

1523
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:48,327
if you don't make
your million,

1524
01:49:48,361 --> 01:49:50,420
you can always come back
here and work for me.

1525
01:49:51,931 --> 01:49:53,489
l won't be back this way.

1526
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:59,901
Well, l guess you've come to be
of your granddaddy's opinion

1527
01:49:59,939 --> 01:50:01,133
that l ain't fit to live with.

1528
01:50:01,174 --> 01:50:04,405
That's too bad.

1529
01:50:06,145 --> 01:50:08,238
Yeah, we might have whooped it
up some, you and me.

1530
01:50:08,281 --> 01:50:11,978
That's the way
you used to want it.

1531
01:50:12,018 --> 01:50:14,612
l used to.

1532
01:50:14,654 --> 01:50:17,350
So long, Hud.

1533
01:50:17,390 --> 01:50:19,051
You know something, fantan?

1534
01:50:19,092 --> 01:50:20,719
This world is so full of crap,

1535
01:50:20,827 --> 01:50:22,727
a man's going to get
into it sooner or later

1536
01:50:22,762 --> 01:50:23,990
whether he's careful or not.
