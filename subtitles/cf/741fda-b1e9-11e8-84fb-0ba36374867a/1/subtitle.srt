<i>The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.</i>

00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,662
<i>It propels the Churchill

Sir, this is odd.

What?

14
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,092
I'm getting a very small
radar cross section,

15
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,470
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

16
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,971
I've got it too.

17
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,974
Check the length, Brendan,
it's at the limit of my angle of scan.

18
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,934
- What's going on?
- Did you chaps run an equipment check?

- Length.

22
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,568
Hundred and fifty miles long?

23

What's 150 miles long?

24
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,073
[beeping] It's a radar trace.

25
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,991

What's the height of the thing?

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,757
I've got a vertical reading

Are you sure you want
to say hidden?

38
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,728
Tell them it's located
in the head of the comet.

39

Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

Use a secured downlink.

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,361
Sorry, Commander, every-thing's
being swamped by the coma winds.

42
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,571
We can't get anything
back to base.

43
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,699
How longs the blackout period?

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,660
All the way.

We're only gonna get
one chance, Derebridge.

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,851
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years.

49
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,770
And we'll both be dead.

00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,844
you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire?

319
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,013
No, they weren't destroyed
in the fire.

320
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,932
That's what we were told
to tell the public.

321
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,016
They were erased.

322
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,059
Erased?

323
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,436
Also, the Churchill's escape pod
is missing.

324
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,063
What's that mean,
did someone escape?

325
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,231
They don't know.

326
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,650
Unfortunately,
the condition of the bodies

327
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,027
make an accurate count impossible.

328
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,488
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

329
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,074
No, no, no.

330
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,703
What started the fire?

331
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,417
The ship's oxygen system ignited.

332
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,127
It was a terribly hot fire.

333
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,715
Yet, you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

334
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,842
- That's correct. [Sighs]
- Where were they found?

335
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,636
In the bay where the space tug
was stored.

336
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,222
Where everything else
was charred.

337
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,641
Incredible.

338
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,935
Is it not?

339
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,185
[Click]

340
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,272
Have you examined the cases?

341
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,483
Using every technique we have.

342
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,528
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

343
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,613
What does that mean?

344
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,782
They're not precisely physical objects.

345
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,702
More like a sort of force field.

346
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,829
<i>We're a bit out of our depth here.</i>

347
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,247
<i>The whole thing is...</i>

348
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,623
Yes, I know.

349
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,043
Incredible.

350
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,128
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard?

351
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,088
No, I suppose not.

352
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,466
What about your two other bodies?

353
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,636
Colonel, may I be excused?

354
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,389
I seem to be feeling a little more
nauseous than I thought.

355
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,390
Yes, of course.

356
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,820
I notice from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

357
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,781
But I understand
your real interest is...

358
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,200
Death, Colonel Caine, correct.

359
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,369
Thanatology is the name for it.

360
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,498
Death for you, Colonel, is a
bureaucratic problem-who did it?

361
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,540
When and why did they do it?

362
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,459
A problem to be solved,
am I correct?

363
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,835
And for you?

364
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,088
Well, I'm fascinated
by death itself...

365
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,798
What happens as we die,
when we die.

366
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,174
What happens after we die?

367
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,926
You mean, life after death.

368
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,177
<i>Yes.</i>

369
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,345
- Is there?
- What?

370
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,472
<i>Life after death.</i>

371
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,725
Do you really want to know?

372
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,476
No.

373
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,108
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

374
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,152
If I am correct,
the life force is conserved

375
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,488
always and in all things,
even after death.

376
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,324
And you think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

377
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,368
Yes.

378
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,245
Yes, I do.

379
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,206
I think that girl, creature,

380
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,334
drained energy, life force,

381
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,005
partially from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

382
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,966
A vampire?

383
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,843
It could be described that way, yes.

384
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,845
I mean, in a sense,
we're all vampires.

385
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,973
We drain energy
from other life forms.

386
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,351
The difference is one of degree.

387
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,604
That girl was no girl.

388
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:24,400
She's totally alien to this planet
and our life form.

389
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,486
And totally dangerous.

390
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,234
Jesus.

391
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,652
[whispering]
Do you believe those blokes are alive?

392
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,530
I'm not paid to believe nothing, am I?

393
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,827
I believe they're alive.

394
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,957
Don't look bloody dead to me.

395
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,729
[alarm sounds]

396
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,389
We've had some trouble,
but every-thing's under control.

397
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,808
<i>I think you better
come down here.</i>

398
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,561
<i>Yes, sir... very good, sir.</i>

399
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,537
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

400
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,333
Well, there's certainly no possibility
of doing a full autopsy on them.

401
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,168
I would like to examine the guard.

402
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,212
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

403
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,339
I believe so, sir.

404
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,844
This is an autopsy on the body
of a young man,

405
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,763
dead approximately two hours.

406
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,806
Did you say he was about 20?

407
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,142
Yes, that's correct.

408
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,977
[clangs]

409
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:13,820

411
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,087
Get the Colonel down here,
quickly!

412
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,969
[groaning]

413

God.

415
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,892
Put him in an isolation cell,
quickly!

416
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,019
Sergeant.

417
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,732
[moaning and yelling]

418
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,164
I had no idea
that it could be passed on.

419
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,040
What do you suggest?

420
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,668
I would recommend that you place
this body in another cell.

421
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,838
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

422
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,591
I won't be at all surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

423
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,426
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.

424
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,511
Also, I want the two other bodies
that were shot... the males.

425
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,263
Collect the pieces and watch them.

426
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,848
Get me the Home Secretary
on the line now.

427
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,433
Sir.

428
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,018
Call for the Colonel, sir.

429
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,519
Sir, you have a call.

430
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,729
Caine.

431
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,522
<i>Sir, we've found
a naked girl in Hyde park.</i>

432
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,566
<i>The body is
in an indescribable condition.</i>

433
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,943
I'll be right there.

434
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,153
They've just found a body
in Hyde Park.

435
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,362
A naked girl.

436
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,783
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

437
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:06,993
Could that be your girl?

438
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,205
- Well?
- That's not her.

439
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,664
Inspector, what about the two boys?

440
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,541
Oh, yes, they were
in the park earlier, sir.

441
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,709
<i>[chimes sounding]</i>

442
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,336
Yeah, we saw her.

443
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,587
I think.

444
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,923
Earlier.

445
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,592
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

446
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,177
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?

447
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,221
No, that's why we notices her.

448
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,806
She was with a dark haired girl.

449
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,349
Real good looking bird and all.

450
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,267
Didn't have a lot of clothes on either.

451
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,311
We thought they might be...
Well, you know.

452
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,646
Yes.

453
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,856
Well, did you see where they went,
where the dark haired girl went?

454
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,942
No, no, we didn't.

455
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,277
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could...

456
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,614
You know,
see 'em doing something.

457
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,825
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?

458
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,867
Half an hour ago.

459
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,994
Yeah, this lad phoned us
and then we phoned you, sir.

460
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,164
Yes, thank you, Inspector.

461
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,836
Obviously, the work of the girl.

462
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,880
You think we can have this body sent
back to the centre with the others?

463
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,508
<i>Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.</i>

464
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,343
Inspector, let me know if you find
anything else, will you?

465
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,719
We'll be taking her back with us.

466

00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,934
Now she has clothes.

00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,691
Just a dream.

644
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:02,817
What dream, Carlsen?

645
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,444
The girl, she visited me.

646
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,738
Visited you, visited you how?

647
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,157
In my mind.

648
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,995
She... she... she...

649
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,540
she had some kind
of mental contact with me.

650
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,833
She's draining me.

651
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,752
Tell us about the dream, Carlsen.

652
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,756
I can't, it's gone.

653
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,216
It's faded.

654
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,259
I can't remember.

655
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,928
Carlsen, have you ever
been hypnotized?

656
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,054
No.

657
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,264
Do you mind
if I have a go at it?

658
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,141
It may help you
with your dreams.

659
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,311
Yeah, let's try it.

660
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,979
Not now, he's too exhausted.

661
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,481
Fine, fine, in the morning.

662
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,401
Just stare at it
until your eyes feel tired.

663
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,861
Then close them.

664
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,655
You'll feel very tired.

665
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,074
Very sleepy.

666
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,785
She seems to...

667
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,664
speak to me in my dreams.

668
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,793
She...

669
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,923
the girl, I feel...

670
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,134
What do you feel
for her, Carlsen?

671
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,179
I feel very...

672
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,972
close to her.

673
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,725
Is she in touch with you?

674
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,645
I feel...

675
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,564
as if my mind...

676
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,067
is not entirely my own.

677
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,362
If she is in contact
with your mind, Carlsen,

678
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,698
perhaps you are
in contact with hers.

679
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,117
Can you see her?

680
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,703
<i>Can you see where she is?</i>

681
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,330
Yes.

682
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,457
<i>Where is she now, Carlsen?</i>

683
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,086
<i>A place, I don't know
the name of it.</i>

684
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,880
<i>She's walking.</i>

685
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,591
<i>She has a different face.</i>

686
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,259
<i>But it's her.</i>

687
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,804
<i>[Fallada] A different face,
how can that be?</i>

688
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,515
<i>She's using a different body.</i>

689
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,308
<i>[Faflada] What is she doing?</i>

690
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,018
<i>She's looking for a man.</i>

691
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,728
<i>[Faflada] What man?</i>

692
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,064
Any man.

693
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,774
A healthy man.

694
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,402
<i>[FaHada]
Does she intend to kill him?</i>

695
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,569
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

696
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,279
<i>She's afraid of being caught.</i>

697
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,031
<i>[Faflada]
How could she be caught?</i>

698
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,574
<i>The body'd give her away.</i>

699
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,785
<i>[Faflada]
So, what is she hoping to do?</i>

700
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,413
<i>She wants to...</i>

701
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,040
<i>draw some energy from him.</i>

702
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,917
<i>Not enough to kill him.</i>

703
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,627
<i>[Fallada] She can do that?</i>

704
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,504
<i>Yes.</i>

705
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,298
<i>There's another mind.</i>

706
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,884
<i>[whispering] Yes...</i>

707
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,846
the girl's name is Ellen.

708
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,557
You mean there are
two people in one body?

709
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:40,976
<i>Two minds?</i>

710
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,186
Ellen and the vampire?

711
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,772
Yes.

712
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,027
<i>She's watching a man.</i>

713
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,224
<i>[Faflada] What is the man doing?</i>

714
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,072
<i>He's parked...</i>

715
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,742
<i>Doing something with his car.</i>

716
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,495
[whispers] License number.

717
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,082
Can you see
the license number of his car?

718
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,585
[whispers] Yes.

719
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,087
<i>Read it out.</i>

720
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,882

Or, uh... R.

00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,682
<i>[Faflada]
What is the make of the car?</i>

724
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:26,104
<i>A white Volvo.</i>

725
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,193
<i>[Faflada] What is she doing now?</i>

726
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,529
They're driving.

727
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,948
<i>[Faflada]
Does she ask him his name?</i>

728
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,618
<i>She's...</i>

729
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,038
<i>pulling her skirt...</i>

730
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,749
<i>over her knees.</i>

731
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,627
<i>She's...</i>

00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,879
<i>He's...</i>

01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,867
belonging to a white Volvo.

739
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,204
The driver of the car picked up
a girl named Ellen.

740
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,915
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

741
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,000
She's connected with the case.

742
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,419
I can't explain
over an open line.

743
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,295
Thank you.

744
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,547
[phone clunks]

745
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,882
Do you think he's telling
the truth about the girl?

746
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,801
Well, we'll soon see.

747
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:43,514
How brilliant if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind.

748
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:46,976
Taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

749
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,229
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

750
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,981
She's hoping to leave no trail.

751
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:55,192
If the girl is no longer
in her original body,

752
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,361
where is her body?

753
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:58,821
Hidden.

754
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,282
Let's find it.

755
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,160
Supposing you're right
about all of this,

756
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,745
what about that ship up there?

757
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:07,621
What's it doing?

758
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,498
We can't know that.

759
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,959
But we've got
to assume the worst.

760
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,336
Maybe they're like
the vampires of legend.

761
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,337
How's that?

762
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,090
They would carry
their earth with them...

763
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,802
In their coffins, wouldn't they?

764

<i>[male] We have

My God, it's immense.

Oh, good.

Yes, of course I'll follow

send in that soldier, please.

Just one moment, Sergeant.

778
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,560
Thank you for coming around.

I'll be with you shortly.

780
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,617
Bloody awful job,
tracing that car.

781
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,870
It belongs to a man named Ned Price
who lives in Yorkshire.

782
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,789
We have him under detention now.

783
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,832
What about the girl?

784
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,501
The girl he picked up was
a nurse named Ellen.

785
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,586
As you said,
Ellen-something-or-other.

786
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,921
He doesn't know her other name.

787
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,132
And he dropped her off
at Thurlstone Hospital

788
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,050
after spending
the afternoon with her.

789
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,969
He was most reluctant
to talk about it.

790
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,305
The man's totally exhausted.

791
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,931
Thurlstone.

792
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,850
Isn't that an asylum
of some sort?

793
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,936
Yes, for the criminally insane.

01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,987
you and I have several matters
to discuss.

807
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,198
Come along.

808
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,495
<i>[female on intercom]
Yes, who is it?</i>

809
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,372
Miss Donaldson,
my name's Colin Caine.

810
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,873
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

811
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,083
Id' like to talk to you.

812
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,251
May I come in?

813
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,670
[door buzzes and clicks]

814
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,179
Yes?

815
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,681
What do you want?

816
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,974
My name's Colin Caine.

817
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,894
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

818
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,896
May we come in and talk to you?

819
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,565
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

820
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,952
May I sit down?

821
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,915
I want to ask you about the man
you spent the afternoon with,

822
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,501
Ned Price.

823
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,546
I don't know
what you're talking about.

824
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,297
<i>I think you do.</i>

825
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,757
Let me see your hand.

826
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,884
Beg your pardon?

827
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,558
You're in there, aren't you?

828
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,102
I don't know.

829
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,311
Tell me.

830
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,397
No!

831
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,524
Carlsen!

832
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,528
It's gone from her,
it's in another body now.

833
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,654
How do you know that?

834
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,949
I can see it in her mind.

835
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,284
[whimpering]

836
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,577
She's resisting.

837
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,204
I'm gonna have
to force her to tell me.

838
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,207
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

839
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,376
An extreme masochist.

840
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,754
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

841
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,673
She wants me to hurt her.

842
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,384
I can see the images
in her mind.

843
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,760
Do you want to stay?

844
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,429
Otherwise, wait outside!

845
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,597
Not at all.

846
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,516
I am a natural voyeur.

847
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,106
Are you in there?

Let go.

851
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,958
NOW!

01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,126
[screams] Now!

01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,337
NOW!

854
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,929
Well?

855
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,723
I've got a physical description.

856
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,233
Doctor, you'd better send someone
to look after Nurse Donaldson.

857
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,442
Is she all right?

858
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,945
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

859
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,322
Possibly.

860
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:59,533
Big man, fat, gray hair.

861
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,826
Birthmark on his face.

862
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,787
Jeffrey Sykes,
the child murderer.

863
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,455
Where did you get
his description?

864
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,541
Where is he now?

865
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,710
He's in solitary confinement.

866
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,086
He's been naughty.

867
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,713
Look, what is this about?

868
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,256
What we're looking for
has moved.

869
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,674
We could be here some time.

870
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,342
I better call London.

871
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,178
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

872
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,680
We have to see Sykes now.

873
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,308
Oh, couldn't this wait
until the morning?

874
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,185
Oh, all right, I'll arrange it.

875
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,147
Anything to oblige, Commander.

876
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,028
[Click]

877
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,030
I wish this were not
so mysterious.

878
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:41,617
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

879
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,120
I mean, if you're going to start
messing about my patient.

880
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,250
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

881
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:54,212
However, I can tell you it is a matter
of national security.

882
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,672
I see.

883
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:59,217
But, don't you think
that I should be present in any case

884
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,136
to represent the interests
of my patient.

885
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,096
- You see-
- Can I talk to you for a second?

886
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,222
Of course.

887
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:08,185
Uh... the man has the IQ
of a child of four.

888
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,396
Well, that's a decision,
I'm afraid,

889
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,272
I shall have to defer
to Colonel Caine.

890
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,774
Yes, of course
you can come along.

891
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,108
Can we start now?

892
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,653
What are you going to do to him?

893
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,238
I'd like to hypnotize him.

894
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,243
What's that?

895
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,787
Pentothal and morphine.

896
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:30,500
I'd recommend it for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

897
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:44,263
Well, he seems quiet.

898
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,723
We're ready when you are.

899
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,559
- Lamson.
- Sir.

[snares]

901
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,918
Can the injection be dangerous?

902
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,920
He should have
no difficulty tolerating it.

903
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,297
<i>There's always a risk, sir.</i>

904
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,467
<i>May I have that?</i>

905
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,429
Well, I'll wake him up.

906
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,391
- What are you doing!
- Stay where you are.

907
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,310
He's sick, Lamson, help us,
I can't explain now.

908
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,896
[Yells]

909
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,483
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

910

[mixed voices yelling]

911
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,389
It's madness.

912
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,142
I want to question him
before it wears off.

913
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,518
Where can we take him?

914
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,771
Up the ramp, sir.

915
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,485
<i>[voices calling out]</i>

916
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,625
We need to be alone
for a minute, Lamson.

917
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,593
How the devil
did you know it was him?

918
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,388
In the nurses quarters
he touched me on the shoulder.

919
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,725
I saw into his mind.

920
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,894
What?

921
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,772
The Colonel appears to be able
to see in the minds

922
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:02,026
of people who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

923
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,278
It happens when I touch 'em.

924
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,407
Let's get him on the table.

925
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,042
HOW?

926
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:21,711
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

927
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,256
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

928
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,925
She's trapped.

929
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,635
I can feel that.

930
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,054
Are you sure?

931
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,266
No.

932
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,354
- Lamson.
- Sir?

933
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,189
Can you bring me another dose
of the hypnotic drug?

934
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,233
I suppose so, sir.

935
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,693
One dose is usually enough.

936
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,237
This is not a usual situation.

937
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,114
How long does the stuff last?

938
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,323
A dose like that?

939
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,324
A couple of hours.

940
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,078
We'll definitely need more.

941
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,580
Bring me three doses.

942
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:58,623
- Three?
- I'll take responsibility, Lamson-—.

943

Sir Percy and myself,
just get on with it.

944
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,087
Yes, sir.

945
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,840
Is a second dose safe?

946
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,842
Surely it can strain his heart.

947
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:12,847
Look... you don't know
what we're dealing with here.

948
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:15,850
If he slips out from under,

949
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,519
she'll escape.

Armstrong, can you hear me?

01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,833

just say yes.

01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,645
Not with this drug,
it's like a wall.

972
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,397
Perhaps you've given him
too much.

973
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:29,275
- Perhaps we...
- Shut up!

974
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,906
Listen, you bitch,

975
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:40,118
I'll keep you in this state
for weeks, if I have to.

976
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,828
Now, you talk to me.

977
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:44,498
Carlsen, be with me.

978
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,916
What do you want from me?

979
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,210
I love you.

980
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,007
<i>What are you?</i>

981
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,925
Why are you so human?

982
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,511
So perfect?

983
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,805
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

984
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,601
Our bodies are unimportant.

985
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,437
<i>As you and your men
have approached in your ship,</i>

986
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,105
<i>we changed them.</i>

987
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,149
For you.

988
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,984
<i>We entered your minds</i>

989
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,904
<i>and found there new bodies.</i>

990
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,324
I took my shape from your mind.

991
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,077
<i>I took your language.</i>

992
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,830
I became the woman
I found there,

993
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,123
in your deepest thoughts,

994
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,627
your deepest needs.

995
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,215
I am the feminine
in your mind, Carlsen.

996
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,636
[whispering] Where are you?

997
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,472
Where are you!

998
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,350
Where's your body!

999
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,895
Let me go! Let me go!

1000
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,315
Let me go! Let me go!

1001
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,320
Touch me, Carlsen.

1002
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:57,863
Let me go.

1003
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:00,574
Let me go.

1004
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,244
Let me go!

1005
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:05,996
Let me go!

1006
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:11,043
Let me go. Let me go!

1007
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,548
Let me go!

1008
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,592
Let me go.

1009
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,264
Let me go.

1010
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,668
- It's already spreading.
- How?

1011
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,378
You didn't stop it,
it's too late.

1012
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,006
That's impossible, we've been only
half a step behind her all the way.

1013
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,567
Sir, this gentleman's
stopped breathing.

1014
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,511
There's no pulse either.

1015
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,815
Sir, I think his neck is broken.

1016
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,528
Lampson, prepare two stretchers.

1017
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,489
One for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

1018
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,908
Prepare all your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

1019
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,202
Yes, sir.

1020
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,335
You said the thing
hadn't stopped,

1021
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,003
it was still spreading.

1022
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,297
Why did you say that?

1023
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,423
I don't know.

1024
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,024
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

1025
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,972
Is it possible we didn't find
all of her victims?

1026
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,431
If we didn't find all
the victims,

1027
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,352
if there are others
besides the girl in the park.

1028
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,227
The thing would spread.

1029
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:37,690
And a chain reaction,
geometrically, until by now...

1030
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,609
[whispers] Oh, Christ.

1031
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:18,271
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to get through to the S.R.C. in London?

1032
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,352
Just a moment, sir,
there's something coming through.

1033
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,777
It is the S.R.C., sir,
for you and Carlsen.

1034
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:28,531
Go ahead.

1035
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:31,743
<i>[male on radio]
Caine, can you hear me?</i>

1036
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,872
Fallada, speak up,
I can't hear you.

1037
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,000
<i>The two males didn't die.</i>

1038
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:41,753
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them

1039
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,048
and transformed the soldiers bodies
into their own likenesses.

1040
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,425
That's the difference between them
and their victims.

1041
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,177
<i>The victims can't leave
their bodies.</i>

1042
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,471
<i>Only the original three
can do that.</i>

1043
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:52,973
But I've killed one of them.

1044
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:57,185
- One of which?
- One of the two male vampires.

1045
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,687
One of the transformed ones.

1046
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,689
How did you kill him,
Fallada, how?

1047
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,941
The old way, Carlsen.

1048
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:08,279
A leaded metal shaft,
penetrating not through the heart,

1049
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,200
but through the energy centre
two inches below the heart.

1050
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:15,371
Not steel, but leaded iron.

1051
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,373
<i>Right, Carlsen?</i>

1052
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,125
<i>Are you there, Carlsen?</i>

1053
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,001
Yes.

1054
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:25,046
<i>Carlsen, you too, Caine,</i>

1055
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:28,800
it is my belief
that the vampires of legend

1056
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,636
came from creatures
such as these.

1057
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:35,056
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

1058
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,601
I know it sounds incredible.

1059
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,188
Do you hear me, Carlsen!

1060
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:45,609
It's more than a belief, Fallada...
it's true.

1061
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,529
They visited Earth before.

1062
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,116
What about
the other male, Fallada?

1063
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,908
He's free.

1064
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,369
<i>You have the girl?</i>

1065
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,537
<i>Yes.</i>

1066
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,997
We'll be with you
as soon as we can, hold on.

1067
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,208
<i>We'll try.</i>

1068
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,295
This came through
while you were talking, sir.

1069
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,506
- What is it?
- A scrambled cryptogram.

1070
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,758
It's to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

1071
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,387
We're to proceed directly
to the Citadel at Whitehall.

1072
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,682
<i>Came...</i>

1073
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,219
[Yells]

1074
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,014
Lieutenant, the controls!

1075
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,775
[screams]

1076
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,113
<i>[Carlsen]
We've lost her, she's gone.</i>

1077
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,573
Where?

1078
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,492
Her body's in London.

1079
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,660
Where in London?

1080
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,831
Carlsen, you've got to tell me
what happened,

1081
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,709
what really happened
on the Churchill.

1082
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:31,005
It wasn't Rawlings who destroyed
the radio equipment.

1083
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,758
And the ship's tapes.

1084
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,009
It was me.

1085
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,052
Why?

1086
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,639
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

1087
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:42,391
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

1088
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,685
What did happen?

1089
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:47,356
I opened her sealed
animation case.

1090
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:52,110
Either I did it or She did it.

1091
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,614
I couldn't help myself.

1092
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,659
I've never experienced such...

1093
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:03,497
I was in love on a level
you've never known, Caine.

1094
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,963
<i>It terrifies me.</i>

1095
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,341
<i>My memory plays tricks on me.</i>

1096
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,930
<i>She was calling me.</i>

1097
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:24,977
<i>Her power was... spiritual.</i>

1098
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,593
<i>She wanted me, Caine.</i>

1099
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,725
<i>It was more than spiritual.</i>

1100
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,573
<i>She took some of my energy.</i>

1101
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,037
<i>And she gave me
some of her energy.</i>

1102
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:35,839
<i>They must have been living off
of each other when we found them.</i>

1103
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,009
<i>There were only three
of them left.</i>

1104
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,138
<i>She killed all of my men.</i>

1105
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,974
<i>One by one.</i>

1106
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:49,061
<i>But I survived.</i>

1107
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,897
<i>She wanted me to survive.</i>

1108
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,566
<i>She chose me!</i>

1109
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,319
<i>Why, why!</i>

1110
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,697
Carlsen, she's not human,
she's not a woman.

1111
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,367
She'll destroy you.

1112
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:07,412
She's destroyed worlds.

1113
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,880
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

1114
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,084
A special bulletin from the BBC.

1115
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,835
<i>[male announcer]
It's obvious that tonight,</i>

1116
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:18,214
<i>London is on the brink of the worst
devastation since the blitz.</i>

1117
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:19,465
<i>From where I'm standing,</i>

1118
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:23,552
<i>I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.</i>

1119
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,847
<i>And thousands of people are now
rampaging through the streets here</i>

1120
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:30,184
<i>in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.</i>

1121
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,895
<i>Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours.</i>

1122
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,439
<i>But for the moment,
it hasn't stemmed what is obviously...</i>

1123
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,235
[clamouring]

1124
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,162
Yes, sir, we've been
expecting you.

1125
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,538
Thank you, carry on.

1126
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:34,540
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

1127
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,208
- Higgins, around the other side.

I am Colonel Caine,

And this man
is Colonel Tom Carlsen,

01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:23,353
United States Air Force and former
commander of the Churchill.

He knows who we are

No, not that I know of.

01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,740
- Has anybody heard of him?
- No.

1190
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,118
Must still be in London.

1191
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:41,537
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening over there?

1192
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:43,247
All we know
for certain, Colonel,

1193
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:46,542
is that a terrible plague
of some sort is sweeping London.

1194
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,461
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

1195
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:51,672
<i>And until that time has elapsed,</i>

1196

I cannot release you
from this compound.

1197

Colonel, we know
what the plague is.

1198
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,344
We are not infected.

1199
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,223
I know what I'm talking about
and we're wasting valuable time.

1200
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:06,437
We have totally isolated London
in order to stop further contagion.

1201
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:10,149
If that fails and the surrounding
areas are threatened,

1202
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,151
Yes?

1203
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:16,322

Has he been here?

No, perhaps he misled you.

there is life after death.

How do you know?

1314
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:11,106
There is a certain
mental transference, telepathy,

1315
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:14,402
that occurs between the vampires
and their victims.

1316
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,739
Carlsen is after the girl.

1317
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:21,449
How did you know that?

1318

Oh, I...

She's in the cathedral.

01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:44,557
She's been there
since she escaped.

Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

you should find us
