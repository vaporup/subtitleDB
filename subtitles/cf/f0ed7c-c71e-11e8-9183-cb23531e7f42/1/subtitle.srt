1
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,615
<i>Long ago, in a land far away,</i>

2
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,340
<i>there once rose an empire,
that stretched from the steppes of China,</i>

3
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,859
<i>to the shores of the Mediterranean.</i>

4
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:27,423
<i>That empire was Persia.</i>

5
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:31,520
<i>Fierce in battle,
wise in victory,</i>

6
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,404
<i>where the Persian sword went,
order followed.</i>

7
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:39,278
<i>The Persian King Sharaman,</i>

8
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:46,445
<i>ruled with his brother Nizam
upon the principles of loyalty and brotherhood.</i>

9
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:50,177
<i>The King had two sons
who gave him great joy.</i>

10
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:51,775
Rejoice!

11
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:57,439
<i>But in the eyes of the gods,
the King's family was not yet complete.</i>

12
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,200
<i>Not until the day he
witnessed a single act of courage</i>

13
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:05,957
<i>by an orphan boy
from the streets of Nasaf.</i>

14
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:08,833
Get out of the way!

15
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:20,212
Stop!
Stop!

16
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:27,642
Run!

17
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:29,730
Run, Bis!
Run!

18
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,156
Stay here.

19
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:10,893
He's getting away!

20
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,951
Let go of me!

21
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:24,668
In the King's name!

22
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,840
- What is your name, boy?
- Dastan, Sir.

23
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,041
And your parents?

24
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,904
Boy...

25
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,519
Brother, take him up.

26
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:54,647
<i>Moved by what he saw, the King
adopted the boy Dastan into his family.</i>

27
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,383
<i>A son with no royal blood,</i>

28
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:01,261
<i>and no eye on his throne.</i>

29
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:05,135
<i>But perhaps, there was something
else that worked that day.</i>

30
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,578
<i>Something beyond simple understanding.</i>

31
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:13,762
<i>The day, a boy from
the unlikeliest of places,</i>

32
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:16,421
<i>became...</i>

33
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:19,924
<i>a Prince of Persia.</i>

34
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:01,676
The fabled Alamut,
even more stunning than I imagine.

35
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,608
Don't be fooled by its beauty prince Tates.
It's a city like any others.

36
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:08,564
Soft countries make soft men.
They stooped to treachery, and now must pay for it.

37
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:11,375
The father made clear,
Alamut is not to be touched.

38
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:15,124
Some consider it sacred.
But since our wise father isn't here,

39
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,447
the decision rests with me.

40
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:20,975
I'll have one last counsel
with my noble uncle,

41
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:25,004
and my two brothers,
trusted Garsiv, and...

42
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:29,473
Where's Dastan?

43
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:32,074
Come on! I bet my entire month's
allowance on this!

44
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,663
- This is embarrassing!
- Why don't you give it a try?

45
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:37,291
Give it in here!

46
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:42,507
Is that all you got?

47
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,579
Prince Dastan!

48
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,495
Where's prince Dastan?

49
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:53,868
Prince Dastan isn't here.

50
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:57,887
Your Highness, please.
Prince Tus has convened the war council.

51
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,657
I'm on my way.

52
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:09,466
Our finest spy, intercepted
a caravan leaving Alamut.

53
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,371
Swords, of the best workmanship.

54
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,612
Steel tipped arrows.

55
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:21,031
A promise of payment from the
Warlord Kosh, to Alamut.

56
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,783
They're selling weapons
to our enemies, Dastan.

57
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,249
An arrow such as this
slew my horse in Kushkan.

58
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,596
Blood will run
in Alamut's streets for this.

59
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:31,293
Or our soldiers will fall
from its walls.

60
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,400
Our orders were to subdue Kushkan,
not to attack Alamut.

61
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:39,533
- Wise words, little brother.
- Words won't stop our enemies,

62
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,905
once they're armed
with Alamutian blades.

63
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,910
We attack at dawn.

64
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,701
Well, if that's your decision,
then let me go in first.

65
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:08,457
- Who wants to share, Garsiv?
- I'll ride at the head of the Persian Army!

66
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:10,948
Dastan leads the company
of street rabble!

67
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:13,850
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.

68
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:17,926
- The honor of first blood should be mine.
- Garsiv, you've got your hands on your sword again.

69
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:21,458
- Where's it should be.
- Oh, my brothers...

70
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:23,723
Ever eager.

71
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:28,831
It's said the princess of Alamut,
is a beauty without equal.

72
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:33,536
We'll march into her palace
and see for ourselves.

73
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,830
There'll be no doubt of your courage
Dastan, but you're not ready for this.

74
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,170
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.

75
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:06,029
Princess Tamina, the Persian Army
my princess, has not moved on.

76
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:12,206
Their faith has little love
for any truth, other than its own.

77
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:16,352
Or perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close.

78
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:19,804
Whatever their faith,
their bows aren't that strong,

79
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,264
Nor it's their aim.

80
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,409
Gather the council.

81
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,813
Tell them, I sit in the High Temple,
I must pray.

82
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:32,076
The High Temple? Alamut hasn't been
breached in a thousand years.

83
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,140
Everything changes with time.

84
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
We should know this
best of all.

85
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:46,018
Remind me why we're
disobeying your brother's orders?

86
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,630
Because Garsiv only knows how
to attack head-on, it would be a massacre.

87
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:55,076
The Alamutians would be busy
with the main gate, so we slip through the side.

88
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,532
Have you been drinking?

89
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:09,646
That's our way in.
There are two gates.

90
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:13,466
The outer one's easy,
it's the inner gate that's impossible.

91
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:17,261
That gate mechanism
is protected by two men gard towers.

92
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,763
Yeah, there's always a way in, Bis,
you take care of the outer gate,

93
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,880
you leave the impossible one to me.

94
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:25,268
That's how you won't be
happy if you get us all killed.

95
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,066
Oh. Wonderful speech, Bis.

96
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:29,422
Rousing!

97
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:42,032
Sound the alarm!

98
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:17,503
Hold this.

99
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,528
Watch your back.

100
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:18,032
- Eastern gate's open.
- That's Dastan's men.

101
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:21,643
He's gotten in, Dastan's done it.

102
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,529
Redeploy to the eastern gate.

103
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:29,140
Redeploy to the eastern gate!

104
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,340
They breached the eastern gate.

105
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:05,665
- Collapse the passages to the chamber.
- Princess.

106
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:10,335
Go now, everyone.

107
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:22,798
- You know what you must do.
- Our wealth must be kept safe.

108
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:45,185
Out of the way!

109
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:15,708
Silly songs and scented smoke
could do little for you now!

110
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,380
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that, hey Garsiv?!

111
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,417
So for once, the stories are true.

112
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,261
We know you secretly build
weapons for enemies of Persia.

113
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,497
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here.

114
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:48,737
And what weapons we had
you overcame.

115
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,428
Our spies say differently.
You can save a lot of pain...

116
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:55,261
All the pain in the world will not help
you find something that does not exist.

117
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:59,902
Spoken like one wise enough
to consider a political solution.

118
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:05,734
- Join hands with Persia's future King.
- I'll die first.

119
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,239
That can be arranged.

120
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,931
Don't!

121
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,815
Prince Tus...

122
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:45,842
Promise me, the people of Alamut
will be treated with mercy.

123
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:59,202
Hey, the Lion of Persia!
The Lion of Persia!

124
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:02,355
They're calling you
the Lion of Persia.

125
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:06,590
You've never excelled
at following order, Dastan.

126
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:10,461
- I have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
- No, no.

127
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,775
No, you have some celebrating to do.
There is however, tradition.

128
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:22,085
Since you took the honor
of first assault, you owe me a gift, homage.

129
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:28,032
- A beautiful dagger.
- He delivered you the city and its princess,

130
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:30,948
- I think that's homage enough.
- I suppose it is.

131
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,354
First dispatches just arrived, my prince.
Wonderful news.

132
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:38,533
Your father's interrupted his prayers
in the eastern palace to join us.

133
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,666
No doubt to commend this
on our great victory.

134
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,363
We've had indications that Alamut
was arming our enemies.

135
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:11,217
Indications? You've got to have
more than indications  to occupy a holy city,

136
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,465
with my troops!

137
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:18,753
This adventure, won't sit
with our allies!

138
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:22,658
But I suppose
you didn't take that into account.

139
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:26,503
Don't look for your uncle, boy!

140
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:30,417
The decisions and its consequences
rest with me.

141
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:41,735
I know you're eager to wear the crown.
But trust me when I tell you, you're not yet ready.

142
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:51,992
No man would know better
than you, father.

143
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:58,158
Because your trust
is something I deeply cherish.

144
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,289
I'll oversee the search for
weapons myself.

145
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:06,339
I vow I will not stand before you
until I hold proof for Alamut's treachery.

146
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:39,514
The third step is the hardest!

147
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,005
Brother!

148
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:48,028
We've uncovered signs of tunnels on the
eastern edge of the city. I'm on my way there now.

149
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,764
Oh, you'll miss the banquet!

150
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:53,391
You and Garsiv can handle father
in my absence.

151
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:56,900
- You do have a gift to honor him with.
- Of course.

152
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,212
Bis, gift!

153
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,984
It's been momentarily misplaced!

154
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:05,663
I knew you'd forget.

155
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,574
The prayer robe of Alamut's regent.

156
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:13,211
The holiest in Eastern lands,
a gift the King would appreciate.

157
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:18,222
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favor.

158
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,841
A rare jewel. Present her
to the King for me this evening, Dastan.

159
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:29,244
Sure you really want another
wife, brother?

160
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,111
Listen to me, Dastan!

161
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,349
A marriage to the princess
assures me the loyalty of her people.

162
00:22:37,562 --> 00:22:41,092
Unbound to us,
she's a dangerous liability.

163
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:47,561
If father doesn't approve our union,
I want you to end her life with your own hand.

164
00:22:56,305 --> 00:23:00,470
So, I'm escorted by prince Dastan,
the Lion of Persia.

165
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:04,566
Must feel wonderful winning such a claim
for destroying such an innocent city.

166
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:07,136
Oh, a pleasure to meet you too, princess.

167
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,265
And allow me to offer,
that if punishing the enemies of my king

168
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,489
is a crime, then it's one I'll gladly repeat.

169
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:16,661
Then you are a true prince of Persia.
Brutal. Without honor.

170
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:20,718
Don't make the mistake
of thinking you know me, princess.

171
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:24,726
- Oh, and what more is there?
- Wait here with Her Highness.

172
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:29,054
If you can manage it.

173
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:33,098
I suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.

174
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:35,638
For your own good.

175
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:47,207
You've eased father's anger , uncle?

176
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:52,022
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the king, Dastan.

177
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:56,343
As long as you remember your most important duty,
you should do well.

178
00:23:56,557 --> 00:24:00,605
- Oh, and what's that?
- Making sure his wine glass stays full.

179
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:07,202
I'm told that another of my sons
has joined the rank of great Persian Warrior.

180
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:21,768
- We missed you, father.
- I was praying for you and your brothers, Dastan.

181
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:29,854
Family, the bond between brothers
that is the sword, that defends our empire.

182
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:34,281
And I pray that that sword
remains strong.

183
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,200
I was hoping my actions
would spare our men unnecessary losses.

184
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:45,064
A good man would've done
as you did, Dastan.

185
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:50,744
Acting boldly and courageously
to bring the victory and spare lives.

186
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:55,457
A great man would've stopped
the attack from happening at all,

187
00:24:55,657 --> 00:25:00,657
a great man would've stopped
what he knew to be wrong,

188
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,240
no matter who was ordering.

189
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,185
The boy I saw in that square,

190
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:11,465
was capable of being
more than just good,

191
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,600
but of being...great.

192
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,240
Well in the meantime,
I have a gift for you.

193
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,889
Some questiones the wisdom of my
bringing a boy from the streets into my family.

194
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:36,893
I saw a boy whose blood
wasn't noble,

195
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:42,256
but whose character was,
a King in spirit.

196
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:45,711
Thank you, father.

197
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,940
May I present,
the prayer robe of Alamut's regent.

198
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,720
What can I grant you, in return?

199
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:14,067
May I present the princess Tamina.

200
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:17,317
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage.

201
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:21,372
It is my deepest wish
that this win your approval.

202
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:31,668
In all my travels, I have never looked
upon a more beautiful city, Your Highness.

203
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:38,088
You should've seen it before your
horde of camel-ridding illiterates descended upon it.

204
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:43,986
Clear as you will make a fine queen.

205
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:50,522
But...Tus already has enough wives.

206
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,352
You Dastan, might take fewer chances,

207
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,867
if such a jewel
waited you in your chamber.

208
00:26:58,047 --> 00:27:03,335
The princess of Alamut
will be your first wife.

209
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,605
Oh, what say you, Dastan?

210
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:17,063
He plunges into a hundred foes without thought,
but before marriage, he stands frozen with fear,

211
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:21,137
and that's for those who say
he's not yet wise.

212
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:24,021
I need a drink.

213
00:27:30,689 --> 00:27:33,209
Stand aside.
Out of my way!

214
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:43,768
- Father...
- Oh, God help us, the robe, it's poisoned!

215
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,240
- Somebody help him!
- The robe Dastan gave him!

216
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:49,317
- Why?!
- Somebody help him!

217
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,389
- Seize the murderer!
- Somebody help him!

218
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:07,447
- Bis! Bis!
- Come with me!

219
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:21,881
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can get us out of here!

220
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:25,221
- You're going to need my help.
- Come on!

221
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:41,835
- Close the gate!
- That way!

222
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,926
Close the gate!

223
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,105
Get down!

224
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:59,187
There, onto the murderer!
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!

225
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:14,367
<i> My loyal subjects, the whole world
grieves at the death of our beloved King.</i>

226
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,687
<i> We are all stricken
by his loss.</i>

227
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:21,613
<i> But the murder came at prince
Dastan's hand, only makes our pain worse.</i>

228
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:25,622
I didn't murder my father.
That robe was given to me by my brother.

229
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:30,666
- Tus did this.
- And now he stands to be crowned king.

230
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:35,453
I didn't kill my father.

231
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:39,407
- I believe you.
- You shouldn't be here,

232
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:44,435
- I shouldn't have let you come.
- But you did.

233
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,918
I promised my brother I'll kill you,
if he couldn't have you.

234
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:58,807
Well, the solution would be
to kiss me, and then kill me.

235
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:02,066
But I have a better solution.

236
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,425
I kill you,
and your problems are solved!

237
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:14,778
Perhaps we could find
another solution.

238
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,630
Well, the solution would be
to kiss me, and then kill me.

239
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:57,358
But I have a better solution.

240
00:30:57,886 --> 00:31:00,086
I kill you!

241
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:10,241
Give back what you stole, Persian!

242
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:14,576
No!

243
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:32,309
- Did you see that?
- See what?

244
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:35,696
Go for that sword again,
and I swear I'll break your arm.

245
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,779
Again?

246
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,900
- You've used up all the sand!
- What?

247
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,939
What is this?

248
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:50,312
Incredible.

249
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:55,188
Releasing the sand,
turns back time.

250
00:31:57,145 --> 00:32:00,745
And only the holder
of the Dagger is aware what's happened.

251
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:06,094
He could go back and alter events,
change time.

252
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,324
And no one knows, but him.

253
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,103
How much can it unliken?
Answer me, princess.

254
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:17,377
You destroyed my city.

255
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:22,352
Our invasion wasn't about weapons
forges, it was about this Dagger.

256
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,210
After the battle, Tus asked
for this Dagger as tribute,

257
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:28,722
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

258
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:31,981
With it, he could change anything. He could
change the course of a critical moment in battle,

259
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:34,963
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

260
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,521
He wouldn't just be the king,
he'd be the most powerful ruler Persia ever seen,

261
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:41,111
greater even than my father.
It was all about this dagger!

262
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:44,862
<i> My treacherous brother
must be brought to justice.</i>

263
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:48,298
<i> And as such, I have doubled
the reward for his capture.</i>

264
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:53,755
<i> Meanwhile, I shall strive to protect
our Empire, as my father would've demanded.</i>

265
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:57,470
<i>A new reign has begun.</i>

266
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:00,536
- What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.

267
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:04,342
She is the most famous horse in the Empire,
this would skew its tracks.

268
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:08,106
- Tracks where, where are you going?
- To Avrat, where my father will be buried.

269
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:11,097
You're wanted for the King's murder,
you're going to march into his funeral

270
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:13,339
alongside thousands of
Persian soldiers.

271
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:16,392
I hope Nizam will be there,
he's the only one I can trust.

272
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,720
He'll see I was set up by Tus,
step aside, princess.

273
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:21,979
Every road to Avrat
will be covered with Persian troops.

274
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:24,555
Well I a'm not taking roads,
I'm going through the Valley of the Slaves.

275
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:27,578
No one goes near that wasteland,
it's filled with murderers and cutthroats.

276
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,584
- Yes, so they say.
- Your whole plan is suicide.

277
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:32,829
My brother murdered my father,
and left his blood on my hands.

278
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:35,121
If I die trying to set that right,
then so be it.

279
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:41,492
So, you're going to leave me here,
in the middle of nowhere?!

280
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:44,883
Noble Dastan, abandoning a helpless
woman in the wilderness.

281
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:48,903
What does your precious
honor have to say about that?

282
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,196
Oh, give me the strength not to kill her.

283
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:04,302
Mounts up, we can't be far behind him.

284
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:13,535
Without the right sand, it's just
another knife. Not even very sharp.

285
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:21,784
- This sand, is there more of it?
- Of course not.

286
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,131
- How can I get some?
- Try standing on your head

287
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,451
and holding your breath.

288
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:38,174
Did you see
what you're looking for, prince?

289
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:41,354
Start walking.

290
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:50,441
So, if you can't prove to your uncle
how the Dagger works,

291
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,340
why on the world would
he believe you?

292
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:55,139
It's not your problem, princess.

293
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,817
You know, you really walk like one.

294
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:01,768
Head held high, chest out,
long stomping strides.

295
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,739
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

296
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:08,977
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth, the world is yours,

297
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:12,877
- And you actually believing it.
- I wasn't born in a palace like you!

298
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:17,475
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,
where I lived if I fought and I clawed for it.

299
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,991
- And how did you become a prince?
- The king, marches the market one day,

300
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:27,535
and he... I don't know, he...

301
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,649
He found me.

302
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:34,891
He took me in, he gave me
a family, he gave me a home.

303
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:47,969
What you're looking at is,
the walk of a man, who just lost everything.

304
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:57,262
Welcome to the Valley of Slaves,
Your Highness.

305
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:06,153
- I'm desperate for a drop of water.
- Well, there's more than we have

306
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:09,049
since you emptied our canteen hours ago.

307
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:13,684
I wasn't born in this desert like
you Persians, all shriveled and angry.

308
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:19,924
- My constitution is much more... delicate.
- I think you mean spoiled.

309
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:24,026
The wells of Alamut are fame
for their clean, cold water.

310
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:28,147
Perhaps less time admiring your wells,
and more time guarding your walls,

311
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:30,317
and you wouldn't be here.

312
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,620
Ah, a miracle, I've silenced a princess!

313
00:36:41,754 --> 00:36:45,074
Tamina?
Tamina?

314
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:50,494
Can you hear me?

315
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:56,853
Yes, Dastan,
I can hear you.

316
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,280
Do you know
where you are Persian?

317
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:21,384
And yet you're enter still?

318
00:37:21,524 --> 00:37:25,169
In the heart of Sudan there's
a tribe of warriors, known as the M'Baka.

319
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:27,884
They strike fear into the hearts
of all they cross.

320
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:31,239
The M'Baka, are masters
of the throwing knife.

321
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:36,180
Wielding blades, said to have been blessed
by the Creator, Himself.

322
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:41,823
Their aim is so murderously accurate,
they can decapitate three men,

323
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,458
with one strike.

324
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:48,395
No. I wouldn't even bother doing that,
if I were you. Do you know why?

325
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:55,036
This is Seso, he is a M'Baka,
I have the good fortune of saving his life,

326
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:59,287
which means, he is now
enduringly indebted to me.

327
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:03,045
So tell me Persian,
is there any good reason why I shouldn't

328
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:09,013
tell Seso, to put his next throw
so little higher?

329
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:49,528
So, this is the one, eh?

330
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:53,564
Yes, you're right,
she's not bad.

331
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:03,348
She could smell better than that.
Still we have a deal.

332
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:07,038
- Clever princess.
- Deal?

333
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:09,310
What deal?

334
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:13,475
- Such a noble prince.
- Such a gentle princess.

335
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:18,157
I've taken you over with my fainting act,
eagerly leaping to assist the foreign beauty.

336
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:20,853
- Who said you're a beauty?
- There's must be a reason

337
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:21,960
why you can't take your
eyes off me.

338
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:25,413
You're... I...

339
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:28,036
I don't trust you,
and you're not my type.

340
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,940
Oh, I'm not some desperate slave girl!
I'm actually capable of voicing my own folks!

341
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:37,144
- Too many for my taste.
- Oh yeah, she'll make a very nice addition.

342
00:39:37,397 --> 00:39:39,607
What you intend to do with her?

343
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:43,619
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?

344
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:46,858
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.

345
00:39:49,045 --> 00:39:52,805
It's hard for me to admit,
but you were right.

346
00:39:55,597 --> 00:39:59,997
- I did see what I was looking for.
- Dastan, listen to me.

347
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,480
When my uncle sees the power
of this Dagger, he'll believe me.

348
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:08,340
Dastan, I know. I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

349
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:13,334
- But your lies are so clever.
- I'm the guardian of the divine covenant.

350
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,023
That Dagger is sacred, it's been
smuggled to a safety when you stole it.

351
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,954
- If the Dagger gets into the wrong hands....
- I will take care of your knife.

352
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:24,779
- You don't want to miss this.
- You don't understand what's at stake!

353
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:29,018
- This is the matter for the gods, not man!
- Your gods, not mine. Come on!

354
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,147
Come on!

355
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,869
Run quickly. Come on, ostrich!

356
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:49,802
- Ostrich racing?
- Every Tuesday and Thursday.

357
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:55,271
Whatever they like in beauty,
they make up for it. Fighting spirit.

358
00:40:56,651 --> 00:41:01,451
- And the races are easy to fix.
- I've heard all these terrible stories of this place.

359
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:05,225
The bloodthirsty slaves,
murdering their masters?

360
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:09,574
That's a good story, it's well told,
ever evolving, but alas untrue.

361
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:13,596
- But the skeletons that we saw...
- Ah, I bought those from a gypsy in Bukhara.

362
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:19,162
I crafted our lurid reputation,
in order to fend off the most insidious evil,

363
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:21,756
that's been lurking this
forsaken country of ours.

364
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:24,178
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Taxes.

365
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:31,066
Dirty Persians, their armies, their fortresses,
their roads, who pays for it all, eh?

366
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,660
The small businessmen.

367
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:38,992
You see, that's why I started
a little campaign, to spread some false notoriety.

368
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:44,246
I spread it like a venerable
disease in a Turkish harem.

369
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:06,301
Behold the mighty ostrich!

370
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:15,605
Come on, my beauty!

371
00:42:21,032 --> 00:42:23,512
I love this!

372
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:29,941
And the tax collectors stay clear of me,
and my customers, everybody's happy.

373
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:35,833
Hey! Get the girls on! Get the girls on,
come on. Crowd control!

374
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:40,516
Don't you stand there!
Run, don't walk!

375
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:44,574
Hey, you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages.

376
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:47,415
Don't look at me like that,
you know what I'm talkin' about!

377
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:50,213
Do your job, crowd control.
Thank you!

378
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,569
You know, I think our little arrange
is going to work out very well, young man.

379
00:42:56,712 --> 00:43:00,592
- Don't touch!
- Oh, ho, ho! She's a lively one! Where did you find her?

380
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:05,648
In the slave market to Lurs
I was headed to Avrat.

381
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,690
I trade her for a camel,
when she attacked me!

382
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:11,696
- The camels are safer.
- Noble, Sheik Amar.

383
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:15,001
I appreciate your hospitality,
you run a fine establishment.

384
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:18,243
- But if you could give me the supply...
- You know something, Persian?

385
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:25,093
You bear a remarkable resemblance to the disgrace prince,
who fled after murdering the king.

386
00:43:34,563 --> 00:43:37,603
Have I told you about
the M'Baka?

387
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:41,997
- Yes, you have.
- Eh, nothing beats a good story. Eh, but yours however,

388
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:46,598
trading her for a camel? Please.
I mean look at her. She's worth at least, two.

389
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,113
And as for you, young man,

390
00:43:49,398 --> 00:43:52,478
did you know your brothers offered rewards
for you, it's quite frankly,

391
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:57,632
between you and me, borders on the obscene.
I traded my own mother for that kind of gold.

392
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,815
What? You didn't know
what she was like?

393
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:03,979
Take him down to the Persian outpost.

394
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,109
Wait, wait, wait.  Look, that...

395
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:11,516
- Nice knife.
- It's nothing.

396
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:16,503
- That's worthless.
- Really?

397
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,863
Melt it down for the jewels.

398
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,230
What's the boy doing?!

399
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:48,857
No, no,  you might kill a bird!

400
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:54,537
Hey, over here!

401
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:07,079
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you!
- Get to the tunnel!

402
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:11,659
Look at this! That's it.
No more fermented goat's milk

403
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,039
after the third race,
do you hear me? Get off, come on!

404
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:17,659
- The gate!
- Get him!

405
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,780
Stop!

406
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,535
- Lift the lever, it opens the gate!
- Give me the Dagger!

407
00:45:27,697 --> 00:45:30,977
- This isn't the time, lift that lever!
- Give me the Dagger!

408
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,963
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.

409
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:44,386
Move, princess!

410
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:46,516
Dastan!

411
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:51,029
Persian!

412
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:01,870
Looking for this?

413
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:08,007
Next time, you...!

414
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:20,086
They all come for my father's funeral.

415
00:46:29,835 --> 00:46:32,635
There are a hundred Persian soldiers
watching that gate.

416
00:46:32,798 --> 00:46:35,278
Maybe more, if want you to stay closer
to this Dagger,

417
00:46:35,386 --> 00:46:37,385
you're going to have to help me
in the Avrat.

418
00:46:43,022 --> 00:46:47,022
All these foreign dignitaries,
I'm guessing you're known up here.

419
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:06,740
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?

420
00:47:06,893 --> 00:47:10,573
The Mugals of the Hindu Kush
are noble people, you should be honored.

421
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,789
Oh yes, terribly.

422
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:24,913
- Dastan, where's the Dagger?
- You're welcome to search me for it.

423
00:47:25,082 --> 00:47:28,447
You'll have to be very thorough.

424
00:47:40,278 --> 00:47:43,878
Tus isn't here,
he must be in Alamut.

425
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,620
The Sand that fills the Dagger, there's more
that hidden somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?

426
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:53,674
That's why Tus stays there.
That's why he's got our army searching for.

427
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:57,173
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

428
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,986
That's impossible.

429
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:02,862
- Difficult, not impossible.
- One more proof, you're insane.

430
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:05,392
Why do you look so impressed?

431
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,135
Out of the way!
Make way!

432
00:49:13,005 --> 00:49:15,645
- Turn around!
- What?

433
00:49:27,027 --> 00:49:29,827
You used to buy those for me,
when I was a boy.

434
00:49:29,985 --> 00:49:33,395
You used to spit the seeds
at Garsiv.

435
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,919
You shouldn't have brought
me here, Dastan.

436
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,362
I had no choice uncle, follow me.

437
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:05,254
I didn't kill father, you know
I'd never do such a thing..

438
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:08,102
Your actions speak otherwise.

439
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:11,446
I had no choice but to flee.

440
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,521
Tus gave me that cloak.

441
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:16,441
- He was the one who poisoned it. - Dastan...
- But he's not here, is he?

442
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:19,340
At his father's funeral,
instead he remains in Alamut.

443
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,684
Our allies will see
our invasion is just,

444
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:24,298
the search for Alamut's weapon
forges is important.

445
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:28,854
Yes, but not if there were none.
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.

446
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:31,602
Tus is after power,
that's why he murdered father,

447
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:35,711
and now he searches not for weapons,
but for the Sand,

448
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:38,531
that fuels the mystical device.

449
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,960
This is why you brought me here, Dastan?
Mystical devices?

450
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:45,461
Do you remember after the battle
you stopped Tus for taken the dagger I'd won?

451
00:50:45,691 --> 00:50:49,471
That dagger is the reason he invaded Alamut.

452
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,416
This dagger, you have it with you?

453
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,208
Yes.

454
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:05,831
It has incredible powers.

455
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,549
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

456
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:15,589
What? I know he was in there.

457
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,244
And where is that so-called evidence?

458
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:21,370
Tamina.

459
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:31,581
- Your hands are burned.
- Yes...

460
00:51:33,975 --> 00:51:37,895
From trying to pull the poisoned cloak
of your father.

461
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:41,265
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.

462
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:43,481
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

463
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:50,852
It's just that a...

464
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:55,281
Tus is my brother, how could
he betray me like this?

465
00:51:55,503 --> 00:52:00,148
I can't say Dastan, perhaps he never
respected you as you deserve,

466
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:02,391
and he saw you as someone he could use.

467
00:52:02,514 --> 00:52:04,444
Someone to keep his wine glass filled.

468
00:52:04,564 --> 00:52:07,009
My service to your father was different.

469
00:52:07,151 --> 00:52:10,671
- We shared the same blood, Dastan.
- How many times did father speak

470
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:13,824
of you saving him from that lion?

471
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,915
- That was his favorite story.
- One of many, yes.

472
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:21,283
- No, that was his favorite.
- I'm afraid you're speaking in riddles, Dastan.

473
00:52:25,388 --> 00:52:28,108
Wait, Dastan!

474
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,480
Over here!

475
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,390
Murderer!

476
00:53:30,406 --> 00:53:32,806
I didn't kill father!

477
00:54:41,975 --> 00:54:44,255
What you're going to do now?!

478
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:34,985
Where is he?!

479
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,119
Hey!

480
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:58,967
Garsiv...

481
00:55:59,888 --> 00:56:03,608
- I didn't kill father.
- Then God will pardon you.

482
00:56:03,805 --> 00:56:05,890
After your head rolls.

483
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:18,374
We don't fight with the
sticks anymore, little brother.

484
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:31,217
That's all you got?

485
00:56:48,964 --> 00:56:52,164
Your Majesty,
I thought you were staying in Alamut.

486
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:55,264
Tell me about Dastan, uncle.

487
00:56:56,225 --> 00:57:00,345
Dastan came to Avrat to kill me,
in the market place.

488
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,525
I just got away.

489
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:06,890
Tus, my death would weaken
your young reign.

490
00:57:07,117 --> 00:57:10,097
- Dastan hopes to start rebellion.
- He wants the throne?

491
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:11,726
I fear so, my Lord.

492
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,850
Putting Dastan on trial would give him
a stage for his sedition.

493
00:57:20,054 --> 00:57:24,734
My advice would be to avoid a trial.

494
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:28,338
Don't bring him back to Nasaf alive.

495
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:39,138
Whatever Dastan's crimes,

496
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:43,051
a public trial will best
communicate the king I hope to be.

497
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,577
Strong, honoring the rule of law.

498
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:51,875
- We are not savages.
- You grow more a king every day.

499
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,800
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.

500
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:05,481
HASSASINS LAIR

501
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:09,694
- I need to speak with our guests.
- About them, my Lord,

502
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:13,378
their practices are unusual,
the servants have seen things.

503
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:17,035
Heard strange sounds, last
week one of the horses vanished.

504
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:22,626
Just make sure that the servants keep
their mouths shut, or I promise you,

505
00:58:22,897 --> 00:58:25,422
they will vanish as well.

506
00:59:28,546 --> 00:59:30,751
I have another task
for you Hassansin,

507
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:33,043
but you'll have to be quick,
your prey has a head start.

508
00:59:33,178 --> 00:59:36,738
You brought what I requested?

509
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:48,672
These practices,
they don't interfere with your skills?

510
00:59:48,843 --> 00:59:51,908
In trance we can see visions
of far future.

511
00:59:52,077 --> 00:59:54,442
Visions of death.

512
00:59:55,796 --> 01:00:00,076
Destiny and the curse.

513
01:00:06,939 --> 01:00:11,259
In the trance we can find anything,
including your nephew, prince Dastan.

514
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:14,647
Then I hope you shall see more deaths.

515
01:00:15,285 --> 01:00:17,285
Soon.

516
01:00:54,095 --> 01:00:56,815
Get down, it's a Persian patrol.

517
01:01:08,952 --> 01:01:11,832
What aren't you telling me?

518
01:01:12,874 --> 01:01:17,914
The trail's been left, maybe they are tired
of your pawn shop for lies and backstabbing.

519
01:01:18,169 --> 01:01:20,831
I had no choice but to leave you.

520
01:01:20,983 --> 01:01:23,611
I take it your uncle didn't listen.

521
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:27,726
It wasn't Tus that killed my father,
it was Nizam.

522
01:01:27,939 --> 01:01:31,099
- Your uncle?
- His hands were burned.

523
01:01:31,278 --> 01:01:33,638
He said it happened trying
to pull off the cloak that killed my father,

524
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:37,662
I've gone over and over at my mind, he never
touched the cloak, he must've handled it before.

525
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:43,716
It was Nizam who poisoned it.

526
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:48,161
What could this turning back a few moments
of time give my uncle? None.

527
01:01:48,388 --> 01:01:51,633
He murdered my father for more
than just a dagger.

528
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:56,730
What aren't you telling me? You know,
you've got quick hands, so do I.

529
01:01:57,444 --> 01:02:00,244
If you want it back,
you tell me everything.

530
01:02:00,401 --> 01:02:03,646
No more games,
no more lies.

531
01:02:13,093 --> 01:02:15,293
Can we get out of here?

532
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:26,119
Oh...only a princess thinks
she can outrun a sandstorm.

533
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:34,038
Nizam is coming to kill us,
he needs me dead.

534
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:37,896
I need to know why.

535
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:46,683
In Alamut rests the beating heart
of all life on earth.

536
01:02:46,932 --> 01:02:50,097
The Sand Glass of the gods.

537
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:55,900
Long ago, the gods slipped down on man
and saw nothing but greed and treachery.

538
01:02:56,155 --> 01:03:01,160
So they sent a great sandstorm,
to destroy all, wipe clean the face of the earth.

539
01:03:01,418 --> 01:03:05,698
<i>But one young girl begged the gods
to give mankind another chance.</i>

540
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,570
<i>Offering her life in exchange.</i>

541
01:03:08,721 --> 01:03:14,601
Seeing the purity within, the gods were
reminded of men's potentials for good.

542
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:18,857
So they swept the sand into the Sand Glass.

543
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:37,944
The Dagger was given to the girl
who saved Man.

544
01:03:38,142 --> 01:03:40,387
<i>Making her the first guardian.</i>

545
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:43,921
<i>The Dagger blade is the only thing
that can pierce the Sand Glass</i>

546
01:03:44,104 --> 01:03:48,554
and remove the Sands of Time,
but the handle only holds one minute.

547
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,443
But if one were to place a Dagger
in the Sand Glass, and pressed the

548
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,059
jewel button at the same time?

549
01:03:53,165 --> 01:03:56,245
- Sand would flow through endlessly.
- You could turn back time as far as you like.

550
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,180
Yes, but it is forbidden.

551
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:10,363
When my father was a boy,
Nizam saved his life hunting.

552
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:15,028
<i>One day the two princes
were stalking a beautiful buck,</i>

553
01:04:15,194 --> 01:04:18,124
<i>but they weren't aware of a lion
stalking them.</i>

554
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:24,088
<i>Nizam saved Sharaman.
My father told us the story over and over again.</i>

555
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:26,820
I don't understand.

556
01:04:26,968 --> 01:04:30,768
Nizam wishes to go back in time
and undo what he did.

557
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:33,414
Not save my father,
let him die.

558
01:04:33,556 --> 01:04:36,646
Then he will be king for a lifetime.

559
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:39,976
And my brothers would never be born.

560
01:04:46,373 --> 01:04:48,653
The storm's passed.

561
01:05:16,587 --> 01:05:21,627
Dastan, the Sands contained within
the Sand Glass are incredibly powerful.

562
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:29,453
Opening the Dagger while it's
inside the glass breaks the seal

563
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:33,415
and destroys the Sand Glass,
causing it to crack and shatter.

564
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:36,578
The Sands of Time would no
longer be contained,

565
01:05:36,743 --> 01:05:39,563
and they would carry
the gods' wrath with them once more,

566
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:42,585
destroying everything in their path.

567
01:05:45,715 --> 01:05:49,395
And all of mankind would pay
for Nizam's treachery.

568
01:05:50,806 --> 01:05:54,291
This is all that would be left of us.

569
01:05:54,479 --> 01:05:58,079
The secret guardian temple outside
Alamut is the sanctuary.

570
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,841
The one place where the Dagger
can be hidden safely,

571
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:03,629
the only way to stop this Armageddon.

572
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:08,112
That's the truth, Dastan.

573
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:14,476
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.

574
01:06:16,513 --> 01:06:19,193
I can't do that.

575
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:26,745
- I'm coming with you.
- You're going to help me!

576
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:31,805
We can sit here and chat,
or you can get on the horse.

577
01:06:47,478 --> 01:06:49,643
Our journey is blessed.

578
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:53,493
We'll stop for the water and push
for the mountain's pass by the nightfall.

579
01:06:54,781 --> 01:06:59,061
- You enjoy telling me what to do.
- Only because you are so good at following orders.

580
01:06:59,288 --> 01:07:01,648
Don't press your luck.

581
01:07:15,104 --> 01:07:17,104
Persian!

582
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:22,392
We parted under certain rush circumstances,
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

583
01:07:23,701 --> 01:07:26,066
We've been tracking you for a week.

584
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:29,885
That little riot you started,
it went on for two days!

585
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:36,293
My beloved racetrack,
all washed away like the footprints in sand.

586
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:38,679
See Lita there...
Look at her?

587
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:40,888
She's all that's left
of my gaming empire.

588
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:44,179
And no matter
your skills as a promoter,

589
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:49,358
you can't organize an ostrich race
with just one ostrich!

590
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:51,941
Am I right?!

591
01:07:52,078 --> 01:07:55,158
Yes sir, come with me.

592
01:08:01,259 --> 01:08:04,859
Did you know that the ostriches
have suicidal tendencies?

593
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:08,413
Look at this poor thing.

594
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:12,462
She used to be a grand champion,
and now I have to watch her

595
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:16,533
night and day to make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

596
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:25,765
Suddenly occurred to me, that the only way
to recoup my tragic losses,

597
01:08:25,959 --> 01:08:29,529
was to track down the two young lovers
who cast this dark cloud upon me.

598
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,920
Oh yes, I'm gonna need the prize on your head,
your brother will be very pleased to see...

599
01:08:38,692 --> 01:08:41,172
The sand dervishes Persian,
they are common as camel dirt...

600
01:08:41,281 --> 01:08:42,880
Sheik Amar, listen to me...!

601
01:08:43,575 --> 01:08:46,460
- I'd rather not.
- Nice knife.

602
01:08:46,621 --> 01:08:49,586
Noble Sheik, we are on the
sacred journey to the temple...

603
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:53,751
Temple, the temple, there is nothing
more sacred than Persian's gold.

604
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,236
Give me the Dagger,
there are too many of them.

605
01:09:46,423 --> 01:09:49,103
You can't kill them all,
you wanna live, give me the Dagger!!

606
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:11,233
Give me the Dagger!

607
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:27,770
Persian, how did you do that?

608
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:32,648
Instinct.

609
01:10:34,289 --> 01:10:36,489
What?

610
01:10:45,264 --> 01:10:48,064
We have to get out of here.

611
01:10:50,272 --> 01:10:54,032
- What happened last night?
- Those vipers were controlled by Hassansins.

612
01:10:54,236 --> 01:10:56,401
- Hassansins?
- For years they were the covert

613
01:10:56,532 --> 01:10:59,332
killing force for the Persian kings,
for my father ordered them disbanded.

614
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:03,614
Nizam must've disobeyed my father's orders
and kept them intact.

615
01:11:03,835 --> 01:11:07,215
This is a secret government killing society.
That's why I don't pay taxes!

616
01:11:07,398 --> 01:11:10,743
- We can't stop.
- Oh perhaps you can't, but we can.

617
01:11:10,929 --> 01:11:13,929
We could use your help
getting to the temple.

618
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:16,425
Hah, by crossing the Hindu Kush
with the storm blowing?

619
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:19,763
You attract troubles like flies around
rotting mango and your insane...

620
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:21,901
There's gold at the temple.

621
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:24,669
More than ten horses can carry.

622
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:27,985
- Tax-free.
- Sir!

623
01:11:57,543 --> 01:12:02,343
- Do you have any idea where you're going?
- I memorized this path as a child.

624
01:12:02,587 --> 01:12:06,552
Every princess must, it's sacred.

625
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:12,231
It's here.

626
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:23,977
The sanctuary, the one place the Dagger
can be hidden safely.

627
01:12:24,204 --> 01:12:27,769
I was expecting golden statues, waterfalls.

628
01:12:31,763 --> 01:12:36,083
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.

629
01:12:53,589 --> 01:12:56,669
Don't cut yourself, princess.

630
01:13:01,726 --> 01:13:03,726
Hey, here!

631
01:13:06,484 --> 01:13:10,324
Not long dead, last night maybe.
Tortured first.

632
01:13:10,526 --> 01:13:14,091
- Hassansin.
- Nizam knows this place.

633
01:13:14,282 --> 01:13:17,007
All dead.

634
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,540
- The entire village, about my gold...
- Where are you going?!

635
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,140
- There is only one way to stop all of this.
- What?!

636
01:13:24,261 --> 01:13:27,861
To make sure the Dagger is safe,
the temple holds the stone the Dagger came from.

637
01:13:28,054 --> 01:13:30,264
What temple? This is
a pile of stones and rocks!

638
01:13:30,396 --> 01:13:33,296
The first thing we learned, if all else fails,
put the Dagger back into the stone,

639
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:38,321
the stone will envelop it, pulling it
into the mountain, returning to the gods.

640
01:13:46,045 --> 01:13:53,410
- The original promise, must be paid.
- What promise?

641
01:13:53,765 --> 01:13:57,485
The gods must take back
the life they spared.

642
01:13:58,272 --> 01:14:00,472
You'll die.

643
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:13,049
- Stay there! Stay there!
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

644
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:17,788
Give me your sword, give me your sword
or do you fortake given that honor.

645
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,890
There are bodies down there,
murdered by Hassansins, on Nizam's order!

646
01:14:21,053 --> 01:14:23,778
- He's the traitor!
- Hassansins no longer exist!

647
01:14:23,937 --> 01:14:26,417
- You always thought you are so clever.
- This is no trick, Garsiv.

648
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:30,926
Sir, all dead inside Sir,
more in the village.

649
01:14:31,152 --> 01:14:33,837
- There is only one way...
- Stay there!

650
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,850
Nizam wants me dead,
wants me silenced.

651
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,605
A trial will be too public.

652
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:50,376
Do you know this?
He said this much, didn't he?

653
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,000
I know it hasn't been easy
between us Garsiv, but still...

654
01:14:54,485 --> 01:14:55,765
we are brothers.

655
01:14:55,821 --> 01:14:57,820
Touching words
with my sword at your throat.

656
01:14:57,949 --> 01:15:00,994
You've often questioned why
father has been so much time in prayer.

657
01:15:01,162 --> 01:15:02,153
Before he died,
he told me that the bond

658
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:05,205
between brothers
is the sword that defends our empire.

659
01:15:05,372 --> 01:15:07,817
He was praying that
that sword remains strong.

660
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:11,924
Why would I go into Avrat for father's
funeral, when I knew it was so dangerous?

661
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:22,233
Nizam recommended your death,

662
01:15:22,362 --> 01:15:25,007
Tus disagreed, ordered
you brought back alive.

663
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:30,158
Nizam wants me dead, and he's hired
Hassansins to make sure that does happen.

664
01:15:30,411 --> 01:15:33,776
He's afraid of what I might say,

665
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:37,003
and who I might tell.

666
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:43,275
Tell me, brother.

667
01:15:45,815 --> 01:15:47,815
Garsiv?

668
01:15:52,074 --> 01:15:54,074
My Garsiv?

669
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,525
Hassansins!

670
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,866
Shut up!

671
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:35,051
Protect the Dagger!

672
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,662
Persian, behind you!

673
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:06,741
Tamina!

674
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:09,899
Forget them, throw these!

675
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:12,790
Find her!

676
01:17:20,462 --> 01:17:22,707
Hey! Over here!

677
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,640
You know what they say about men
with big swords!

678
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:42,342
Tamina, let me do it.

679
01:17:43,414 --> 01:17:46,514
Only a guardian can return the Dagger.

680
01:17:46,685 --> 01:17:49,750
This isn't something you can do, Dastan.

681
01:17:51,009 --> 01:17:54,609
I'm ready for this.

682
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:57,887
I'm not.

683
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,040
Tamina!

684
01:19:04,248 --> 01:19:07,048
Out, enough, out!

685
01:19:25,656 --> 01:19:27,656
Garsiv!

686
01:19:28,035 --> 01:19:30,515
Dastan, I'm sorry.

687
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:36,869
Save the empire.

688
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,960
Brother... Brother.

689
01:19:46,188 --> 01:19:50,268
- Where is the Dagger?
- It's gone.

690
01:19:51,697 --> 01:19:56,497
Protect the Dagger, no matter the
consequences, that was my sacred calling.

691
01:19:57,164 --> 01:20:00,044
That was my destiny.

692
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:08,785
We make our own destiny, princess.

693
01:20:08,969 --> 01:20:11,534
We'll get it back.

694
01:20:43,361 --> 01:20:46,081
We're going to need another horse!

695
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:51,565
- Where will you go?
- To Alamut.

696
01:20:54,837 --> 01:20:59,237
Nizam will use that Dagger to pierce
the Sand Glass, and he has to be stopped.

697
01:20:59,464 --> 01:21:02,749
He has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped.

698
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:07,812
What?

699
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,940
Oh, a knife thrower with a conscience.

700
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,853
Our friends in the palace said
that the Persians have broken through

701
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,939
to the first level of the tunnels.

702
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:38,712
They will reach the Sand Glass
within hours.

703
01:21:38,863 --> 01:21:43,023
Nizam's keeping the Dagger in the high
temple, guarded by some sort of demon,

704
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:47,365
- covered in spikes.
- The Hassansin that killed my brother.

705
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,990
It's the only thing that stands between
us and the Dagger.

706
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:54,174
No man can stand within
twenty yards of him and live.

707
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:58,106
Some don't need to get that close.

708
01:22:17,757 --> 01:22:20,077
Spare some water, sire.

709
01:22:28,524 --> 01:22:30,624
You sure about this?

710
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:32,781
I owed the boy.

711
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,871
But, you are a M'Baka, scourge of
the Namibian plain.

712
01:22:36,036 --> 01:22:38,756
Me, I'm a slightly dishonorable
entrepreneur, this...

713
01:22:38,874 --> 01:22:41,873
nobility business
is not the cloth we're cut from.

714
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,970
Hurry.

715
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:49,570
My friend, has anyone ever told you
that you talk too much?

716
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,401
Come on.

717
01:25:45,705 --> 01:25:48,705
Have I told you about the M'Baka?

718
01:25:49,879 --> 01:25:53,799
- Yes, you have.
- I hope your brother listens to you, Persian.

719
01:26:02,607 --> 01:26:04,572
He's here.

720
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:08,493
Seal every gate!
Find him!

721
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:43,831
- It's clear.
- Dastan, I don't...

722
01:26:45,382 --> 01:26:47,902
I don't think you should do this.

723
01:26:48,047 --> 01:26:50,509
Is that concern I hear?

724
01:26:50,652 --> 01:26:53,080
- Caution.
- Sprinkled with concern.

725
01:26:53,227 --> 01:26:58,707
- You flatter yourself, prince.
- And you used to be a better liar, princess.

726
01:26:58,981 --> 01:27:02,111
Perhaps I'm out of practice.

727
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:05,963
This won't be the last time
we'll be together.

728
01:27:15,428 --> 01:27:19,828
- Where is the Dagger?
- You Persian bureaucrats, such soft hands.

729
01:27:28,908 --> 01:27:33,188
- It's been found, my Lord.
- The Sand Glass?

730
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:37,317
I don't have the Dagger.

731
01:27:38,673 --> 01:27:40,673
Leave me.

732
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:43,590
Hello, Tus.

733
01:27:43,722 --> 01:27:45,922
Dastan!

734
01:27:46,727 --> 01:27:49,067
- We need to talk.
- Then talk!

735
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:53,510
- Alone.
- Wait outside the chamber, now!

736
01:27:55,783 --> 01:27:58,183
We are brothers, did you know?

737
01:27:59,455 --> 01:28:01,455
The robe that killed father
was poisoned by Nizam.

738
01:28:01,578 --> 01:28:05,063
- Nizam? You are mad.
- Who gave you the robe, Tus?

739
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:07,581
Who gave you the robe?!

740
01:28:07,718 --> 01:28:11,798
You trust him, as did I, but Alamut
wasn't supplying our enemies with weapons.

741
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:14,256
- Nizam lied to us.
- Why he would do such a thing,

742
01:28:14,395 --> 01:28:18,040
- what could he gain?
- Listen to me carefully.

743
01:28:18,234 --> 01:28:20,714
Beneath the streets of this city
lies an ancient force,

744
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:24,308
a container, holding
the fabled Sands of Time.

745
01:28:24,494 --> 01:28:26,574
Nizam wishes to use it
to corrupt history,

746
01:28:26,706 --> 01:28:29,706
he wants to turn back time
and make himself king.

747
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:32,202
Sands of Time?

748
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,505
Heresies Dastan, pagan madness.

749
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:37,395
I've seen its power with my own eyes, Tus.

750
01:28:37,556 --> 01:28:41,836
Nizam discovered its resting place, and if
we don't stop him our world could end.

751
01:28:42,058 --> 01:28:46,023
If you're gonna kill me, the best
you do it now.

752
01:28:51,536 --> 01:28:53,981
This is no ordinary dagger.

753
01:28:54,123 --> 01:28:58,603
You press the jewel on its hilt,
and you'll see.

754
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,600
I should have the strength
to do this before we invaded the city.

755
01:29:03,758 --> 01:29:08,323
- What are you talking about?
- To act of what I know is right.

756
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:10,602
No matter the consequences.

757
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:24,663
- The soldiers remain out...
- Stay where you are!

758
01:29:31,264 --> 01:29:33,229
He took his own life.

759
01:29:33,351 --> 01:29:37,071
Then, God have mercy on the traitor,
for he chose the path of the coward.

760
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:40,430
We both know Dastan was many things,

761
01:29:40,571 --> 01:29:43,851
but not... a coward.

762
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:51,470
<i>This is no ordinary dagger. Press
the jewel on its hilt, and you'll see.

763
01:30:12,245 --> 01:30:14,685
No matter the consequences.

764
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:17,237
Stop!

765
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:20,978
A moment ago you died
before my eyes.

766
01:30:21,843 --> 01:30:24,963
- Oh, you pressed it.
- How did you know I would?

767
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:29,647
Cause we are brothers.

768
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:34,441
The day we left for war,

769
01:30:34,509 --> 01:30:39,089
our father told me a true king
considers the advice of the counsel.

770
01:30:39,323 --> 01:30:43,053
But always listens to his heart.

771
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:46,451
You shouldn't defy to go so far
for me to believe you.

772
01:30:46,626 --> 01:30:49,791
Your Majesty,
the soldiers tell me that...

773
01:30:51,598 --> 01:30:54,518
I see that Dastan
has indeed return.

774
01:30:57,106 --> 01:30:59,226
Tus, remember what I told you!

775
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,740
No, a moment.

776
01:31:07,748 --> 01:31:11,468
Poor Tus, so eager for the crown.

777
01:31:12,881 --> 01:31:16,761
And you, Dastan,
always charging in,

778
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:20,610
so desperate to prove
you are more than

779
01:31:20,804 --> 01:31:24,409
something that king
scraped of the street.

780
01:31:25,525 --> 01:31:28,485
What a glorious mess we are.

781
01:31:29,365 --> 01:31:31,930
It seems that bond between brothers,

782
01:31:32,077 --> 01:31:35,557
is no longer the sword
that defends our empire.

783
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,730
Yes!

784
01:32:00,246 --> 01:32:02,846
He was one of us.

785
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:07,398
He was the priest of the temple.

786
01:32:07,549 --> 01:32:10,869
That's how Nizam discovered
the existence of the Sand Glass.

787
01:32:11,049 --> 01:32:13,894
He corrupted the guardians,
infected us.

788
01:32:14,054 --> 01:32:17,019
We are no longer pure.

789
01:32:17,773 --> 01:32:20,093
We must hurry.

790
01:32:27,372 --> 01:32:29,337
Pulley.

791
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,938
Get pulley, now!

792
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:39,092
The guardians built passageways underneath
the city, a secret access to the Sand Glass.

793
01:32:39,302 --> 01:32:41,867
If we move fast enough,
we can get there before Nizam.

794
01:33:08,268 --> 01:33:11,388
That would be the stand
to the Sand Glass chamber.

795
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,485
There is only one safe path.

796
01:33:14,862 --> 01:33:17,942
Faster!

797
01:33:35,394 --> 01:33:38,114
Follow in my footsteps.

798
01:33:40,193 --> 01:33:43,913
Nothing can touch the surface,
other than where I step.

799
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:07,441
Run, Dastan!
Run!

800
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:19,619
Dastan!

801
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:06,552
Nizam!

802
01:37:08,726 --> 01:37:12,446
You murdered your own family.
Sharaman was your brother!

803
01:37:12,643 --> 01:37:14,888
And my curse.

804
01:37:17,072 --> 01:37:19,792
I looked up to you.

805
01:37:21,495 --> 01:37:22,575
Dastan!

806
01:37:22,643 --> 01:37:27,023
I never understood, why
my brother brought trash into the palace.

807
01:37:27,249 --> 01:37:29,699
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan.

808
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:32,802
It's where you stay under my reign.

809
01:37:42,862 --> 01:37:44,942
Tamina!

810
01:37:45,449 --> 01:37:48,649
Nizam, don't use the Dagger
to undo your past!

811
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:51,470
- It will unleash...
- Unleash, what?!

812
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:54,225
Gods' wrath?!
Hell itself?!

813
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,520
Don't do this!

814
01:38:15,496 --> 01:38:18,616
Stop him! If the glass
shatters, the world dies with it.

815
01:38:20,212 --> 01:38:24,812
It's not my destiny, it's yours.
It always has been.

816
01:38:25,047 --> 01:38:27,577
- Let me go.
- I won't.

817
01:38:27,723 --> 01:38:30,803
- Let me go.
- I'm not letting you go!

818
01:38:30,978 --> 01:38:34,938
I wish we could have been together.

819
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:45,220
- Dastan!
- No! Tamina!

820
01:39:16,674 --> 01:39:21,174
- Dastan!
- Tamina!

821
01:40:35,839 --> 01:40:37,839
Prince, Dastan!

822
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:43,070
- Bis, you're here?
- Of course I'm here.

823
01:40:43,643 --> 01:40:47,163
Our men surrounded Alamut's palace,
battle is over.

824
01:40:47,352 --> 01:40:49,637
Not yet.

825
01:40:57,414 --> 01:41:00,134
Wait!

826
01:41:03,507 --> 01:41:05,507
Wait!

827
01:41:12,688 --> 01:41:17,888
Brave soldiers of Persia, we have been
deceived into attacking this holy city!

828
01:41:18,150 --> 01:41:22,275
- Alamut, has no weapon forges!
- Dastan!

829
01:41:23,705 --> 01:41:27,305
- Have you gone mad?
- I cannot stand silent in the face of treachery.

830
01:41:27,503 --> 01:41:31,403
This war was set up by one
trusted above all us.

831
01:41:31,608 --> 01:41:35,473
- Our uncle Nizam.
- Dastan has fought hard today,

832
01:41:35,677 --> 01:41:38,799
perhaps too hard. What he needs now
is to get out from under this

833
01:41:38,971 --> 01:41:41,975
burning sun, to rest.
Gather his wits.

834
01:41:42,141 --> 01:41:44,825
The weapons we've found
are forgeries!

835
01:41:44,978 --> 01:41:47,593
There are no weapons here uncle,
and you know it!

836
01:41:47,743 --> 01:41:51,103
And the spy, who supposedly
intercepted them, was hired by you,

837
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:54,570
to persuade all of us,
to invade Alamut!

838
01:41:54,748 --> 01:41:57,278
What is this, Dastan?
Victor's remorse?

839
01:41:57,424 --> 01:42:00,544
You yourself led the attack,
brought us this great triumph.

840
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:05,629
I should never have
let the attack happen.

841
01:42:07,356 --> 01:42:10,316
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.

842
01:42:12,781 --> 01:42:15,226
It will never be you.

843
01:42:15,369 --> 01:42:19,409
You'll never been king,
you don't have the heart.

844
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:23,625
You will die
in a shadow of a great man.

845
01:42:28,514 --> 01:42:31,434
Get him down from there, before
he makes even bigger fool of himself!

846
01:42:31,634 --> 01:42:35,529
Tus, before we left Nasaf,
father told you this:

847
01:42:35,734 --> 01:42:37,314
"That the true king, considers
the advice of the counsel,

848
01:42:37,383 --> 01:42:41,282
but he always
listens to his own heart."

849
01:42:41,743 --> 01:42:44,228
Father and I were alone.
How could you know that?

850
01:42:44,372 --> 01:42:47,972
He's right, he knows us and
he knows we are capable of.

851
01:42:48,165 --> 01:42:51,130
- Just listen to your heart.
- He defies your order,

852
01:42:51,294 --> 01:42:55,259
leads attack and now wants
to turn back, Tus...

853
01:42:55,932 --> 01:42:59,132
Take action here.

854
01:43:10,788 --> 01:43:13,553
The spy knows the truth,
find the spy!

855
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:17,070
Bring him to me,
we'll wring it from him.

856
01:43:54,356 --> 01:43:56,596
You had what every man
could ever dream,

857
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:00,455
love, respect and family.

858
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:04,370
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?

859
01:44:40,511 --> 01:44:43,191
Princess of Alamut.

860
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:46,730
I was misled to attack your city.

861
01:44:47,605 --> 01:44:50,050
Forgive me, Your Highness.

862
01:44:50,193 --> 01:44:53,593
Let me try to make amends?

863
01:45:00,834 --> 01:45:03,194
It would be to our mutual advantage,

864
01:45:03,333 --> 01:45:07,618
that our nations be united
by a bond stronger than friendship.

865
01:45:08,221 --> 01:45:10,741
Marriage.

866
01:45:11,267 --> 01:45:16,747
Your marriage to one who is both
conqueror and savior of your city.

867
01:45:21,491 --> 01:45:23,656
Dastan.

868
01:45:23,787 --> 01:45:27,267
Royal blood or not,
he's every bit a son to our father.

869
01:45:27,459 --> 01:45:30,439
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.

870
01:45:30,605 --> 01:45:33,550
The true prince of Persia.

871
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:41,050
Get up there,
before I take your place.

872
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:48,310
Hello, princess.

873
01:45:49,785 --> 01:45:53,925
It's a customary to accompany
a proposal with gifts but, uh...

874
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:58,246
I was surprised and unless I'm unprepared.

875
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:02,110
I've nothing for you, save...

876
01:46:02,305 --> 01:46:05,985
that which is already yours.

877
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:20,671
Walk with me, prince Dastan.

878
01:46:28,262 --> 01:46:31,662
How can I trust the man who
breached the walls of my city?

879
01:46:31,846 --> 01:46:35,291
But I'm starting to think that I'm no longer
the same man who breached those walls.

880
01:46:35,482 --> 01:46:38,482
That's a short time for
the man to change so much.

881
01:46:38,648 --> 01:46:41,173
Perhaps.

882
01:46:44,036 --> 01:46:46,576
It sounds as
if you've discovered something here.

883
01:46:46,723 --> 01:46:51,228
- What might that be?
- The new spiritual awareness.

884
01:46:51,459 --> 01:46:54,589
- A destiny.
- Yes, exactly.

885
01:46:54,761 --> 01:46:57,961
I believe we make
our own destiny, princess.

886
01:46:58,137 --> 01:47:00,467
You have an unfortunate lack of curiosity.

887
01:47:00,604 --> 01:47:04,004
- With no doubt, one of my many flaws.
- Please don't mock me, prince.

888
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:09,838
I hardly think we know each other
well enough for that, princess.

889
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:13,915
But I look forward,
to the day that we do.

890
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:59,915
