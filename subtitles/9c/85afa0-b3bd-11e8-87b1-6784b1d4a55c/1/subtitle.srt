1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,189
Command Post, Inspector Chang Choy.
Beach Order is in place.

2
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:39,994
Son of a bitch!

3
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:31,278
<i>With June 30th only 72 hours away,
Hong Kong is poised -</i>

4
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:38,475
<i>- for its return to Chinese rule
after 150 years as a British colony.</i>

5
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:44,879
<i>With both Prince Charles and
President Jiang Zemin here, -</i>

6
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:49,481
<i>- security will be unprecedented
for Tuesday's ceremonies.</i>

7
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:54,355
<i>Security zones on land, sea
and air will be patrolled...</i>

8
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:03,080
A belly ring!
Does that increase sexual pleasure?

9
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,918
Lance, work with me!

10
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:11,000
- Lance, burn this.
- We can't wear underwear with this.

11
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:14,635
- Why nOt?
- This underwear sucks.

12
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:19,833
They're denim, the underwear is
nylon. They'll react chemically.

13
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:24,078
Then don't wear it.
I'm against underwear.

14
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:29,922
Come on, you're models! Look
like you haven't eaten in a week.

15
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:39,199
- I need your support today.
- Be a gentleman, like your partner.

16
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:45,441
<i>Where is Ray? I need your support.
I have to get out of this business.</i>

17
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:32,926
<i>- Nice wheels.
- Take it for a spin. A short spin.</i>

18
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:42,846
Hey Marcus, nice glasses. Cartier?
I've got boxes of them.

19
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:48,240
Hard to believe.
Marcus Ray, gone legit.

20
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:55,165
- Any good? The last ones.
- They work Iong enough to be sold.

21
00:06:55,328 --> 00:07:00,038
I want to go out
with my reputation intact.

22
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,006
You can always come back.

23
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:09,084
- Your designers must speak English.
- Why? They're excellent copies.

24
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:13,400
"Puma", one "m".
Only an idiot would buy these.

25
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:17,880
These are hot. Collectors' items.

26
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:28,085
It's not your shipment. Get
your hand off, or you'll Iose it.

27
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:32,321
You're in toys now, Skinny?
Aren't you too big for that?

28
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:37,802
I can be in any business I want.
No one can touch me.

29
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:42,565
You know why your legs
didn't just get broken?

30
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,607
I've a big bet on you
in today's race.

31
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention, please.</i>

32
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:58,046
<i>The Merchants' Association
Charity Race begins in ten minutes.</i>

33
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:05,319
Hey, give me some energy.

34
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:09,767
Give me the illusion
that you give a crap!

35
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:15,004
Pachy! Are you okay?
Do you want some water?

36
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,003
You work for me?
As an elephant?

37
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,641
Then put your head on
and get to work. Get going!

38
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,119
Girls, I'm late.

39
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:40,489
Where were you? We've had
two meetings and a fashion show.

40
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,283
At noon, the copier blew up, and at
one, everyone said "Where's Ray?"

41
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,765
- Did you get my running shoes?
- I've something even better.

42
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:59,528
Puma-5000X. Hydroplane soles
and shock absorbers.

43
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:02,285
It's the bomby-bomb.
It's the shits.

44
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:06,239
<i>- It is shit.
- You're kidding, right?</i>

45
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:13,842
It doesn't matter what you wear.
I'm going to win.

46
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:19,049
Eddie!

47
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:23,090
Just back from Tokyo, huh?
You son of a bitch.

48
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:29,210
I'm one step ahead
of an angry husband.

49
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:37,607
- Hey, Tommy.
- Eddie, nice clothes. Steal them?

50
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:40,366
He doesn't mean it.

51
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:45,287
I heard you were running.
I can't let you spoil my record.

52
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:50,367
- I'll kick your ass like last year.
- You cheated last year.

53
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:55,731
No, because since you met Tommy,
you've got soft.

54
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:02,520
Who's next?

55
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:08,325
We've got Shocks, K-3, Kandu.

56
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:14,045
We've got 100,000 on Eddie Wong
and on V-Six Jeans. Any takers?

57
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:22,044
- He's betting on us both, again.
- See you at the finish line.

58
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:31,088
Here, take it! Because if you hang
out with them, we're worth nothing.

59
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:36,168
- He's family.
- His brother is a top mobster.

60
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:41,123
Not his brother, his cousin.
Don't be an old lady.

61
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:51,890
You worry too much.
I'm in condition.

62
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:56,127
It's a straight shot to the finish.
We've a Iock to win.

63
00:10:57,334 --> 00:11:00,406
Eddie's got the Fix in.

64
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:11,052
On your marks.

65
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:17,009
Get set.

66
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:44,970
- Don't panic. We've a Iock to win.
- I'm not worried about winning.

67
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:48,765
- I don't want to die.
- You won't die, okay?

68
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,656
Turn around!

69
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:28,414
You're in shape!
You're in shape!

70
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,535
He's taking a short cut.
Turn here!

71
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,768
Turn here!

72
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:43,967
What are you waiting for, you idiot?

73
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:58,218
Sorry!

74
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,255
- Go, go!
- Sorry.

75
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:08,612
You got it.
We're winning!

76
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,730
Move that beautiful ass of yours!

77
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,973
- What are you doing?
- I'm just saying, we're winning.

78
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:28,249
Move it!
You have to want it.

79
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:33,536
The finish line, super-fast!

80
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:39,934
- How did he get ahead of us?
- Good question.

81
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:49,739
Those Pumas must be knock-offs.
What scumbag sold them?

82
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,052
Eddie!

83
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,659
Something's not right.

84
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,173
- It's not him.
- So what?

85
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,569
- Eddie!
- No Ray, not a good idea!

86
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,528
- They've got Eddie.
- You've got me.

87
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,213
Drop it!

88
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,938
Eddie!

89
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:22,779
He was cheating again.

90
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:35,300
- You're gonna talk.
- No, he's not.

91
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:47,420
Move, move!

92
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:53,379
Police!
Don't move.

93
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:58,019
Stand up slowly.
No sudden moves.

94
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:04,337
- I got her.
- Tommy.

95
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:07,496
What did you do?
She's a cop.

96
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:13,613
She's a cop?
You didn't tell me she was a cop.

97
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:32,463
You say you were innocent
participants in this rickshaw race?

98
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:39,497
- A number of questions remain.
- We were just defending ourselves.

99
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:43,294
- We're not criminals.
- We'll see.

100
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:49,461
We've identified this man,
lvan Largoff.

101
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:55,621
Killed at the scene by Detective
Ling. He's a former KGB agent.

102
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,778
If you're innocent,
why did he attack you?

103
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:02,018
Maybe he wasn't that intelligent.

104
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:08,936
We're legitimate businessmen,
with an office, -

105
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,815
- that employs a Iot of
Hong Kong citizens.

106
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:18,458
We pay taxes, to pay for the police.
That's why they're everywhere.

107
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:23,939
Mr Ray, our records show you entered
Hong Kong as an illegal immigrant.

108
00:19:24,106 --> 00:19:28,179
You were deported,
but came back for the good money.

109
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:33,056
<i>- You built an illegal business.
- We all make mistakes.</i>

110
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:38,779
<i>Did you know the racer the Russians
killed worked for Eddie Wang?</i>

111
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:43,737
<i>- That name doesn't ring a bell.
- What about you, Mr Hendricks?</i>

112
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>No bells here... but my ears
are ringing from the accident.</i>

113
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:54,097
- Stress levels up. They're lying.
- What a surprise.

114
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,940
<i>Your self-defence story checks out.</i>

115
00:19:57,107 --> 00:20:03,899
Don't leave the jurisdiction.
This investigation isn't over.

116
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:06,581
And we know where you live.

117
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:13,505
Once they've pulled that Union Jack,
I don't care what they do with you.

118
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,740
Mr Hendricks, Mr Ray:
You may go.

119
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:21,785
- We've a lock to win.
- Good call, good job.

120
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:28,541
Wait a minute!

121
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,826
Besides trashing your company's
reputation, why are you here?

122
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:38,142
Who are you?
Do we get a parking ticket?

123
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:42,904
Karen Lee. Executive VP,
International Sales, V-Six Jeans.

124
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:48,705
I realise this is difficult
for you, -

125
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:52,622
- but try to think.
What are those?

126
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:57,738
- V-Six 606, size eight.
- Your size.

127
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:01,219
I'm a six, thank you.

128
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:04,586
Mr Hendricks,
the masseuse is here.

129
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:08,378
Cancel her for the rest of the week.

130
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:11,586
Make it the rest of the month.

131
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:17,346
You're not used to pulling
your own weight, but try. Pull!

132
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:22,623
I meant, together.

133
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:28,664
Pull.

134
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:37,060
That's enough.

135
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,225
Now try these.

136
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,298
In light of our mascot,
how do you explain this?

137
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,145
I've been working out, and you...

138
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,460
- Okay, they're knock-offs.
- Exactly.

139
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,023
Cheap 8-ounce denim, instead of
the 14-ounce in our authentic jeans.

140
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,580
There are knock-off artists here?
I'm shocked.

141
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:14,259
Hong Kong is Knock-off Central, for
everything from Benetton to Puma.

142
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,664
- The Pope's Catholic. So what?
- These are from the last shipment.

143
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:25,940
- Half the shipment was counterfeit.
- That's impossible.

144
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:30,946
Inspector's report. Check it
against the shipping manifest.

145
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:38,625
She's right.
She Iooks good when she's right.

146
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,420
And if half the shipment
was of 8-ounce denim, -

147
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:49,861
- at wholesale, that means that
V- Six Jeans has lost $4,200,000.

148
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:55,460
You didn't convert
Hong Kong dollars to US dollars.

149
00:22:55,631 --> 00:23:02,663
The real figure is $5,400,000.
This calculator has a...

150
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:05,221
Excuse us.

151
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:09,271
Bangkok won't ship the yardage
because of the hand-over.

152
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:13,710
Swap the destination with the
origin. When it gets here, -

153
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:18,423
- tell customs we made a mistake,
and "return" it here.

154
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:22,870
Don't you have something
for me to sign?

155
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:29,187
- I sign things too. In private.
- Like that falsified document?

156
00:23:29,352 --> 00:23:33,504
- No, Ray signs the false documents.
- I agree.

157
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:40,704
I think you've spent your time here
chasing ass and getting massages.

158
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:47,392
The massage industry has problems.
I'm trying to help out Iocal girls.

159
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:54,743
I don't know or care whether you two
idiots are the instigators of this -

160
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:57,552
- Or just dupes.

161
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:03,345
We'll see tonight, when Customs raid
the factory they came from.

162
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:08,792
You must identify the merchandise.
Eddie Wang signed the lease.

163
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:13,663
Eddie Wang?
Doesn't sound familiar. Right?

164
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:18,584
I'll pick you up at 6:30 tonight.

165
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:25,307
Ray got his ass kicked last night
and hasn't slept. He can't do this.

166
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:31,504
Don't worry. If Ray's mixed up in
this, he'll get rest... in prison.

167
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:34,746
- And so will you.
- Prison?

168
00:24:34,914 --> 00:24:41,672
Yes! Counterfeiting is a crime,
whether it's clothes or money.

169
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:46,703
If you're not available tonight,
I'll assume you're trying to flee.

170
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:51,186
And then trust and believe,
I will take appropriate action.

171
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:56,983
Like I said, 6:30.
Be there.

172
00:24:58,715 --> 00:25:02,867
She Iooks good when she's mean.
Right?

173
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:14,550
Where's Eddie, big guy?

174
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:18,753
Where's your boss?

175
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:23,625
Light you a cigar?
Of course not... you're dead.

176
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:29,273
Idiot Comrade Volkov killed you.

177
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:39,267
We've had enough of your screw-ups,
Volkov. You're always high.

178
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:45,666
Cure you: Cold turkey.

179
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:54,388
Tribiev, your passports are ready.

180
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:02,715
Didn't your mothers teach you not to
make a mess? This is a shit hole.

181
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:08,872
- You want to get out of Hong Kong.
- And you want to get paid.

182
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:17,792
Our V-Six friends are going to the
factory. Go there and clean up.

183
00:26:17,956 --> 00:26:21,666
<i>Das vedanya, cossacks.</i>

184
00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:31,027
You're worried about Miss V-Six. I'm
worried about the men chasing Eddie.

185
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:35,949
- Why?
- Why?

186
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:40,952
<i>Because he's a scumbag
who's mixed up in some ting.</i>

187
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:45,713
<i>- Tong. Ting is a beverage.
- I thought it was tang.</i>

188
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:50,746
- Eddie's no scumbag. He's family.
- "Eddie's no scumbag."

189
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:57,393
Easy on my shirt, big fella.
That's a $ 1,000 Hawaiian.

190
00:26:57,557 --> 00:26:59,628
That's not... Jesus!

191
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,875
- You did that on purpose.
- So I'm a scumbag? You think I am.

192
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:17,115
So now he's a mind-reader?
Asshole! I should kill him.

193
00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:34,916
<i>The Chief's upset with you.
About this.</i>

194
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:39,311
You made a spectacle.
You should have kept a Iow profile.

195
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,794
Tommy?

196
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,429
- Stay out of it!
- Stay out of what?

197
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,831
- Go back, or you're in trouble.
- I am already.

198
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,434
Hold on.

199
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,118
- We never hear from you.
- I can't risk tipping off Ray.

200
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,273
You can't handle a street punk
like Marcus Ray?

201
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,228
It's a Iocal, Eddie Wang.
He runs a knock-off factory.

202
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,112
He made some enemies, and I got
caught in the middle. I'd better go.

203
00:29:03,281 --> 00:29:07,593
This Eddie Wang,
we may have to send him away...

204
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:18,397
You think I can't smell cops?
It all fits now.

205
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:24,318
The partnership, the knock-offs...
You're setting me up!

206
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:28,838
- It's not what it Iooks like.
- You're using me to get to Eddie.

207
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:36,271
- Who are you working for?
- What are you doing?

208
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:40,831
What?

209
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:46,076
- What are you doing?
- Who the hell are you?

210
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:51,441
If they go over,
I'm the last man you'll ever see.

211
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:55,356
Game's over, Harry.
We've got to tell him.

212
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:59,959
- Tell him.
- We work for the government. CIA.

213
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:02,795
Harry's my boss.

214
00:30:02,962 --> 00:30:05,840
Now pull us up, Ray.

215
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:08,596
Pull us up, Ray.

216
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:30,236
You Iook confused. It's simple:
Hendricks needed a cover, -

217
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:36,114
- so we used you, even though
you were a little dirty. Understand?

218
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:41,033
You understand what I'm saying?

219
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:46,038
Don't you understand what you do...
affects me?

220
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:50,594
You want to destroy our business?
Is that what you want?

221
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:56,520
<i>You were supposed to make me legit!</i>

222
00:30:56,683 --> 00:31:01,553
- You lied to me.
- You didn't need to know.

223
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:06,673
Not one legitimate businessman
in Hong Kong would work with you.

224
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:12,476
But I did.
I've carried you for four years.

225
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:20,642
<i>- You're the king of knock-offs.
- I was.</i>

226
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:24,080
But you're still a fake.

227
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:32,798
<i>Now that is a problem.</i>

228
00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:35,239
Why?

229
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:39,716
There's this woman executive
from V-Six Jeans.

230
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:43,764
Somebody's counterfeiting our jeans.
She thinks it's us.

231
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:48,396
- They're raiding the factory.
- What? Shit!

232
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:53,161
What is the matter with you,
asshole? You're in trouble.

233
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:18,164
Nice building.

234
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:23,878
Too nice for your salaries.
Check into sub-let if convicted.

235
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:26,924
It's just the Iobby that's nice.

236
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:35,842
- Let me...
...help you.

237
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,395
May I?

238
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,681
Here's the factory lease.
Eddie Wang signed it.

239
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:51,443
- That doesn't prove it's him.
- He's screwing us.

240
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:55,281
With Eddie,
it's more like date rape.

241
00:32:55,446 --> 00:33:01,204
Could you tell my partner there
are three people on this bench?

242
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:08,202
- I hear you like 007?
- Just the ones with Sean Connery.

243
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,325
I hope we find something.

244
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:16,959
Last week we busted a warehouse
full of knock-off Apple Babies.

245
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:20,756
- I Iove those.
- You, too?

246
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:25,318
I buy them for my niece.
It's becoming a full-time job.

247
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:34,756
- Vanilla Creme! The rarest one!
- She's yours.

248
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:40,878
- But she's a phoney.
- It seems like they're everywhere.

249
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:55,680
- Everything is prepared.
- The men are in position.

250
00:33:55,848 --> 00:34:01,480
Once it's secured, get the V-Six
people to identify the merchandise.

251
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:07,917
Marcus Ray... Parents were doctors,
died in Indo-China.

252
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:13,640
Adopted age ten, then meaningless
jobs until you met Tommy.

253
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:18,404
- That's supposed to be me?
- I'm sorry.

254
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:21,720
Don't be sorry.

255
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:26,963
I'm sorry that Eddie
will probably be arrested.

256
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:41,561
- What are we waiting for?
- A food delivery.

257
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:45,881
When the door opens, we go in.

258
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:49,359
- Szechwan or Cantonese?
- It's "Mom's Pizza".

259
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:02,601
<i>- Who's there?
- Mom's Pizza.</i>

260
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,648
Come on, let's go!

261
00:38:23,775 --> 00:38:26,164
Freaking hell!

262
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:06,164
Here's your wallet.

263
00:39:06,336 --> 00:39:10,409
- I accept your apoIogy.
- I didn't say sorry.

264
00:39:10,576 --> 00:39:15,172
Okay, the apoIogy's over.
Happy?

265
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:22,572
- Happy. I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

266
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:34,606
Let's go see your boss.

267
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:52,289
These guys have something
against escalators?

268
00:39:55,817 --> 00:40:00,368
- What's with the sign?
- We're entering the Buddha.

269
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:03,328
What's the cover charge?

270
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:11,452
- We have to search him.
- I cleared it with the boss.

271
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,053
- I said, I've cleared it.
- Step back.

272
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:20,690
You want to tell me
what it is you want?

273
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:25,978
A trade. I'll bring you Eddie Wang,
if you take him out of Hong Kong.

274
00:40:26,138 --> 00:40:32,247
Are you a comedian? You think Eddie
Wang is worth that? Show me more.

275
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:45,852
It's the Green Flame project, 1989.
They must have finished it.

276
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:49,055
That's not a battery
your friend is carrying.

277
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:54,133
It's an explosive device
equal to half a stick of dynamite.

278
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:58,052
If he knew it was a nano-bomb,
he wouldn't carry it.

279
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:02,496
With that level of miniaturisation,
they could target anything.

280
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:08,291
They have it. They have a remote
detonator, probably microwave.

281
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:13,374
They'll put these bombs into
clock radios, stereos, -

282
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:17,134
- cell phones, even children's toys.

283
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:22,896
Then a Iot of innocent people
will be in great danger.

284
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:31,615
- What do I do about Eddie?
- Bring Eddie in.

285
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:35,294
Tell him I'll protect him.
He might know something.

286
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:45,257
- So you're a spy?
- An intelligence analyst.

287
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,175
- Anything I heard of?
- You've heard of the Gulf War?

288
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,494
- What the hell's that?
- It's a message from Eddie.

289
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,414
- Where the hell are we?
- It's a fruit market.

290
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:06,176
- Johansson would Iove this.
- I hope he keeps his word.

291
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,732
Shouldn't we be leaving a trail
of breadcrumbs?

292
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,775
So you still care?

293
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:29,100
My mother always Ioved that record.

294
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:34,176
- Why are you listening to it?

295
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:47,370
I found the record in Papa's things.
You can take it.

296
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:51,375
We raided a factory last night,
Eddie.

297
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:54,977
- Why?
- You were knocking off our jeans.

298
00:42:55,141 --> 00:43:00,420
Ray, you're more than adopted,
you're family. Be a buddy.

299
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:04,734
Tommy's my bud.
Buddies like to play.

300
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:09,657
They're just the tip of the iceberg.
Do you know what you did?

301
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:14,737
- Who set you up? Tell me!

302
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:22,297
You won't like it. It was Skinny,
when he brought the Russians.

303
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:24,532
- Skinny?
- Yes!

304
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:30,174
I give them knocked-off toys.
They modify them, and I ship them.

305
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:33,573
<i>It's between you two.
Please aim at him.</i>

306
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:38,862
- When I found out, I dumped them.
- They were nano-bombs.

307
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:43,379
- You know?
- Tommy's CIA.

308
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:51,492
The little dweeb is CIA?
Good cover.

309
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:56,293
Not for Iong,
if Ray keeps telling everyone.

310
00:43:57,703 --> 00:44:01,537
Eddie, I made a deal for you.

311
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:08,895
They'll help you go somewhere safe.
I promise you.

312
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,341
Skinny told me that he'd help.
I'll help myself.

313
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:16,063
I've something for you, in the safe.

314
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:20,580
It's the biggest thing here
since Typhoon Hattie.

315
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:25,454
I was going to sell it
to the highest bidder, anywhere.

316
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:28,741
But family is family.

317
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:53,933
- Eddie!
- Damn it.

318
00:45:02,104 --> 00:45:04,096
We've got to run.

319
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:10,457
- Don't you know the way out?
- No idea.

320
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:38,100
Don't they have bananas here?

321
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:57,098
God, I hate this fruit!

322
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:54,226
- It's me. A VCR?
- Everyone who comes here is on it.

323
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,264
Move!

324
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,706
Stop playing around.

325
00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:42,101
I'm going to find a place
to collapse.

326
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:45,344
Wait for me in the office.

327
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:51,584
<i>We're on the look out
for the white guy who killed Eddie.</i>

328
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,627
Let's get rid of this shit.

329
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:04,343
Skinny!

330
00:50:05,912 --> 00:50:10,190
Better run, Skinny.
They're coming after you.

331
00:50:10,352 --> 00:50:14,664
<i>Gwei-lo, you're a dead man.
You killed Eddie.</i>

332
00:50:14,832 --> 00:50:19,223
The Russians did it.
The ones you got him involved with.

333
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:23,226
Liar! I didn't get Eddie
involved with Russians.

334
00:50:23,392 --> 00:50:29,070
- Then who was he hiding from?
- You saw him get executed.

335
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:32,628
Executed...

336
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:37,947
Why...
Why did you say "executed"?

337
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:45,669
- Now you'll tell me everything.
- Cut it out, Ray.

338
00:52:15,395 --> 00:52:18,865
- You won't do it!
- oh yeah?

339
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:46,314
- You bet on both sides, right?
- You bastard.

340
00:52:47,756 --> 00:52:50,429
<i>"A Hong Kong Love Song".</i>

341
00:52:50,596 --> 00:52:54,987
<i>We hope it put Jiang Zemin and
Prince Charles in a cuddly mood.</i>

342
00:52:55,156 --> 00:53:00,071
<i>News at five, with an update of
the explosion at the fruit market.</i>

343
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:25,987
- What happened to you?
- An explosion.

344
00:53:26,157 --> 00:53:29,672
At the fruit market?
The one on the news?

345
00:53:29,837 --> 00:53:36,231
You've got to get to hospital.
Look, there's blood... shit!

346
00:53:40,837 --> 00:53:43,397
We need to get cleaned up.

347
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:48,712
Sometimes you're in such shock,
you don't know you're hurt.

348
00:53:52,638 --> 00:53:56,836
What were you doing
in a place like that anyway?

349
00:53:56,998 --> 00:54:00,308
- Ray has some contacts.
- What kind?

350
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:05,598
A friend, a buddy.
He blew up. Shit happens.

351
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:13,037
Eddie knew about the bombs!
That's why you killed him!

352
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:21,588
I don't know what you mean.
Eddie was like a brother.

353
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:27,948
If I'm right, this tape will prove
you booby-trapped Eddie's safe.

354
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:32,032
Piece of shit!
You killed him.

355
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:37,148
Don't go anywhere. We'll watch a
movie and have some popcorn.

356
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,549
We'll be back.

357
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,754
- Hold on. Let me find it.
- Stop it there.

358
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:53,431
- Son of a bitch!
- Who is that?

359
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,955
Karen, the V-Six exec.
I don't believe this!

360
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,830
Hendricks is in danger,
go after him. I'll talk to Skinny.

361
00:55:49,361 --> 00:55:51,511
Knock-offs, Jesus!

362
00:55:57,841 --> 00:56:02,232
You and Marcus acted strange.
Did you tell me everything?

363
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:08,715
We were deciding what to eat.
I said, "How about Szechwan?"

364
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:13,909
Let the machine get it...
And he said, Cantonese.

365
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:21,757
I was trying to decide what wine
we should order...

366
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:24,913
Oh, I like this.
I'm into this!

367
00:56:28,962 --> 00:56:32,671
Back when you got that fake identity
from the CIA...

368
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:36,198
Let's play a game
called "Twenty Questions".

369
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:41,117
Question one: Are you alone,
or are there more of you?

370
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:52,511
Tommy... She saw Eddie before us.
She's a bigger knock-off than us.

371
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:59,073
Watch your step, Ray!

372
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:06,958
- Are you sure?
- She was on the tape.

373
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:27,635
I was never into threesomes!

374
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:34,042
I've got her!

375
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:37,240
- What do we do?
- Take her to the chief.

376
00:57:37,403 --> 00:57:43,433
Johansson is dead. The Russians
killed him. And Skinny, too.

377
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:47,756
You'd better talk, bitch,
or I'll blow your head off!

378
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:55,754
Look into my pants. Go on, you were
eager five minutes ago, you shit.

379
00:57:55,924 --> 00:57:58,438
Just do it.

380
00:57:59,764 --> 00:58:02,358
In the back.

381
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:13,962
- CIA? Bullshit.
- It's a fake, Tommy.

382
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:18,595
- Just like her.
- No, it's real. Check it.

383
00:58:27,724 --> 00:58:31,240
It's good.

384
00:58:31,405 --> 00:58:36,843
I'm sorry for what I said. But
those handcuffs bit into my wrists.

385
00:58:37,005 --> 00:58:40,964
- I should have blown your head off.
- Why the jeans act?

386
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:47,075
Langley suspected there was a mole
near Hendricks. I have to find it.

387
00:58:47,245 --> 00:58:50,362
- I have an emergency contact...
- No!

388
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:57,363
There's a special security unit here
with the VIP's. They can help us.

389
00:58:57,525 --> 00:59:01,643
<i>The American delegation
is led by Vice-President Al Gore, -</i>

390
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:04,478
<i>- who is a champion of trade
with Hong Kong.</i>

391
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:09,959
<i>Vice-President Gore wil meet
with the commercial attachés...</i>

392
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:16,605
- You can't go like that.
- Formal or casual?

393
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:20,395
- Let's go.
- I'll bring the van around.

394
01:00:16,527 --> 01:00:21,362
Holy fucking shit!
The pockets of our jeans.

395
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:35,919
<i>At Government House,
another historic moment.</i>

396
01:01:36,089 --> 01:01:42,278
<i>The last British governor watches
as the British flag is lowered.</i>

397
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:47,204
After Eddie dumped the knock-offs,
the Russians used our jeans.

398
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:53,286
So they're into fashion now.
You know where you're going?

399
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,886
The computer says
they're shipping the jeans tonight.

400
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,882
- You can't get away with this.
- Shut up!

401
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:12,329
<i>- They are getting away with it.
- I'm trying to mind-fuck them.</i>

402
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:17,848
- I got top scores in verbal skills.
- Could I die alone, please?

403
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:27,769
Lucky for some, it's the hand-over.
There's only one sea route out.

404
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:32,447
If we hurry we can catch them.
Can you swim?

405
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:40,966
Electronics are amazing.
Three months old, and obsolete.

406
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:44,567
The best part of microchips
is the mega-bucks.

407
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:50,408
Small as a cell phone,
but it can do the job.

408
01:02:57,451 --> 01:03:01,330
We've told everybody.
The FBI, the Mossad...

409
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:04,961
- Shut up!
- Sureté, Barnaby Jones...

410
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:11,207
Eat these. You'll turn green.
They're better than diet pills.

411
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:17,481
<i>Two of these remove your appetite.
In fact, they remove you.</i>

412
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:21,770
Or maybe you will drink this?

413
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:29,646
- You want to drink this, baby?
- Let's talk. I have information...

414
01:03:29,812 --> 01:03:33,487
You like it? You want more?
I'll give you more.

415
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:37,804
I'll open your mouth wide open,
this time.

416
01:03:48,612 --> 01:03:51,889
Way to go, Harry!

417
01:03:52,053 --> 01:03:57,127
You even left a few alive
to interrogate. Untie me!

418
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:07,332
- Congratulations.
- You gave it to the wrong guy.

419
01:04:09,493 --> 01:04:14,089
You just eliminated a partner
you didn't need anymore.

420
01:04:14,253 --> 01:04:17,643
Just like you did with Skinny.

421
01:04:46,254 --> 01:04:49,849
Washington never thought
it could be you, Johansson.

422
01:04:50,014 --> 01:04:54,292
- After 20 years, why?
- Entrepreneurship!

423
01:04:55,974 --> 01:05:02,766
Once we have our baby bombs all over
the US, there'll be a monthly bill.

424
01:05:02,934 --> 01:05:05,084
$ 100 million a month.

425
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:09,532
If they don't pay,
it's "Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road".

426
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:14,405
"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road?"
You'd better buy some new CD's.

427
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:54,967
Shoot them.

428
01:06:17,856 --> 01:06:22,088
What the hell was that?
Go find out!

429
01:06:28,536 --> 01:06:31,176
Toss it!

430
01:07:32,938 --> 01:07:37,216
Sir, we've picked up a signal.
An unauthorised intrusion.

431
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,055
- Any change?
- No, ma'am. Still incoming.

432
01:07:47,218 --> 01:07:52,657
It's a cargo vessel. She's already
past the first line of buoys.

433
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:57,097
- And the second.
- The next line is the deadline.

434
01:07:57,259 --> 01:08:01,571
Attention, all air units.

435
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:07,735
This is Guardian. Proceed to
intercept approaching vessel.

436
01:08:07,899 --> 01:08:11,608
<i>- Use all necessary force.
- Roger.</i>

437
01:08:54,620 --> 01:09:00,889
<i>Attention, cargo vessel.
Attention, cargo vessel.</i>

438
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,934
- Report in. What's going on?
- We have visual.

439
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:10,128
<i>The vessel seem to be drifting.
Nearing deadline. E TA, one minute.</i>

440
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:17,379
The vessel must not, repeat,
must not cross the deadline.

441
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:22,057
If it does,
execute with extreme prejudice.

442
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:28,012
<i>We copy. Extreme prejudice.
Activate and arm weapon systems.</i>

443
01:09:28,181 --> 01:09:30,695
<i>Weapon systems are active.</i>

444
01:09:30,861 --> 01:09:36,731
<i>Attention, cargo vessel!
Attention, cargo vessel!</i>

445
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:42,692
<i>This is a restricted area.
Change course, or we will fire.</i>

446
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:47,218
<i>Do you read?
Cargo vessel, do you read?</i>

447
01:09:52,302 --> 01:09:57,092
<i>Attention, cargo vessel.
This is a restricted area...</i>

448
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:22,860
<i>Attention barge 28.
Change course, or we open fire.</i>

449
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:28,133
<i>- Locked on target.
- Fire on my command.</i>

450
01:10:32,543 --> 01:10:37,492
<i>Steady.
Five... four... three...</i>

451
01:10:38,143 --> 01:10:41,658
<i>- Two...
- Guardian, she's stopping.</i>

452
01:10:41,823 --> 01:10:46,692
<i>The vessel has stopped
and seems to be turning back.</i>

453
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:54,697
<i>- Weapons are still hot.
- Deactivate weapons systems.</i>

454
01:10:54,863 --> 01:11:00,142
<i>- Confirm, deactivate weapons.
- Confirmed. Return to base.</i>

455
01:11:00,303 --> 01:11:05,331
<i>- Roger, returning to base.
- Phew! That was a close one.</i>

456
01:12:55,226 --> 01:12:57,979
Come on, come on.

457
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:02,616
<i>Move your asses up to the tower!
Go!</i>

458
01:14:23,988 --> 01:14:26,582
We are under heavy fire.

459
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,307
See if it's clear.

460
01:18:01,754 --> 01:18:05,713
It's gonna blow!
Come on, it's gonna blow!

461
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:15,992
Let's go, start the engine!

462
01:18:22,594 --> 01:18:26,382
- We're all gonna die.
- I'm doing my best.

463
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:50,908
Are you okay?

464
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:58,586
- Are you all right? What happened?
- I smoked his fat ass.

465
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:04,626
Look. It's his detonator.

466
01:20:07,957 --> 01:20:10,630
What are you Iooking for?

467
01:20:11,877 --> 01:20:14,550
Johansson.

468
01:20:17,597 --> 01:20:22,625
<i>Victoria Harbour lights up with the
first fireworks of the hand-over, -</i>

469
01:20:22,797 --> 01:20:26,107
<i>- kicking off a two-day
fireworks extravaganza -</i>

470
01:20:26,277 --> 01:20:30,793
<i>- where over $ 100 million
will literally go up in smoke.</i>

471
01:20:30,957 --> 01:20:37,511
<i>Fireworks seems particularly
meaningful in these two nights, -</i>

472
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:43,116
<i>- as the world watches Hong Kong
put on its biggest-ever show...</i>

473
01:20:43,278 --> 01:20:49,194
They found explosives in our jeans?
People don't want that.

474
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:51,633
Some people do.

475
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:56,474
- Check this out.
- You're crazy, that's evidence.

476
01:20:56,638 --> 01:21:02,349
I've checked. The average American
home has 3.57 remote controls.

477
01:21:02,518 --> 01:21:08,434
How about one that did everything?
The VCR, TV, jacuzzi, sprinklers...

478
01:21:13,638 --> 01:21:19,828
You turn that thing
and the garage opens up.

479
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:38,677
- We know nothing about electronics.
- So let's stick to what we know.

480
01:21:38,839 --> 01:21:43,754
<i>A special report. A loud explosion
was witnessed in Kowloon -</i>

481
01:21:43,919 --> 01:21:48,595
<i>- shortly after the fireworks began.
Spectators saw green flames.</i>

482
01:21:48,759 --> 01:21:53,674
<i>The authorities will not say whether
the explosion was part of the show.</i>

483
01:21:54,879 --> 01:22:01,353
