1
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,950
Comrades, Japan belongs to the People!

2
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,430
Not the Emperor, not the military!

3
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,150
Long live the People!

4
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,470
The Black Dragon Clan is coming!

5
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,310
Kick the Chinese out of the school!

6
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,390
Maintenance is important.

7
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,110
Do not allow

8
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,880
the fluid to enter the reservoir nor the engine.

9
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,910
The function of the pump

10
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,550
is only then maintained.

11
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,350
And never try to repair it without the help of an engineer.

12
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,510
Stop writing!

13
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,310
All Chinese get out of here!

14
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,870
You can't enter here!

15
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,230
This school is not for Chinese people!

16
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,950
Get out now!

17
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,510
Behave yourself here!

18
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,590
Are you alright?

19
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,390
Rotten scum! What do you think you're doing!

20
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,230
Who are you to speak to me?

21
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,350
Yamada Mitsuko. The one who looks down at you!

22
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,110
Chicken!

23
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,630
I don't care who you are.

24
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,430
Before I count to three, you better disappear.

25
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,980
One!

26
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,070
Two!

27
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,830
Three!

28
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,270
Master...

29
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,470
He is Funakoshi Fumio.
Master of the Black Dragon Clan.

30
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,510
Have you already given up fighting?

31
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,950
Violence is no solution.

32
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,430
Now you see the result.
Didn't you learn anything in my school?

33
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,030
Professor Watanabe. Excuse my pupils.

34
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,630
Be thankful for his mercy.
You could all be crippled if he wanted you to be.

35
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,830
Who did you fight with?

36
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,100
Me.

37
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,790
You alone? Your Kung Fu is quite efficient.

38
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,990
I am Funakoshi Fumio from the Black Dragon Clan.
And you?

39
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,910
Mitsuko, why are you here?

40
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,470
Uncle Funakoshi,
my pen has been broken by your pupils!

41
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,950
It was very expensive!

42
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,870
You know I am poor. Why tell me about it?

43
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,110
Do you guys have some money?

44
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,430
Satisfied?

45
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,390
Just like your blessed father.
Impossible to satisfy.

46
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,790
Don't you worry nobody will marry you?

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,030
No problem at all. Chen Zhen is all I want.

48
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,870
Chen Zhen?

49
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,350
Yes. Chen Zhen of Jing Wu School.

50
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,870
- Jing Wu School of Shanghai?
- Yes

51
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,830
- That means Huo Yuen-jia...
- Is my Master.

52
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,990
Impressive...

53
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,670
Is there a problem?

54
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,670
I just received...

55
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,550
a telegram from Shanghai.

56
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,990
It says that Master Huo was killed
in a Kung Fu match by...

57
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,110
his opponent Akutagawa Ryuichi of Nijiguchi.

58
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,150
He is from our clan.

59
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,430
Impossible!

60
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,630
I am verry sorry. But this is what I was told.

61
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,550
Excuse me.

62
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,510
Too bad I missed the opportunity
to challenge him myself.

63
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,580
Chen Zhen!

64
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,190
Where are you going?

65
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,990
Chinese embassy.
To check if this is really true.

66
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,430
A Japanese could never have beaten your Master.

67
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,550
Stop the Japanese invasion!
Long live the People!

68
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,430
Long live the People!

69
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,510
I warn you!
If you stay too long I will look for someone else.

70
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,150
Chen Zhen!

71
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,150
Are you coming back to Japan?

72
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,510
When they leave China,
I will come back to Japan.

73
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,260
They are only going to Tsingtao
to fight the Germans.

74
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,750
You better be right about it,
because Tsingtao belongs to China.

75
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,270
Both Japanese and Germans
are invaders to China.

76
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,100
Chen Zhen

77
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,750
Do you hate the Japanese?

78
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,990
I don't know!

79
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,710
Being in this area, we have no choice.

80
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,700
Take care of yourself.

81
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,350
Chen Zhen!

82
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,030
JAPAN AND UNITED KINGODM FORM ALLIANCE

83
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,510
KARATE MASTER AKUTAGAWA MATCHED
WITH MASTER HUO

84
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,430
Some small change!

85
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,910
I don't have anymore.

86
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,790
I really don't have more.

87
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,590
I don't have anymore.

88
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,390
Go away!

89
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,670
- Good Morning.
- I am not Japanese.

90
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,550
You are not? Me neither!

91
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,110
Please sit down.

92
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,030
- Where shall I take you?
- Jing Wu School.

93
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,670
Jingwu School? To learn Kung Fu?

94
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,670
Yes, I want to learn Kung Fu. Please go!

95
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,310
Don't go to Jingwu.

96
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,670
Everyone here knows Jingwu was number one,

97
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,440
but this is over.

98
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,510
If you don't wanna take me there
I will take another drive.

99
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,190
Wait, wait. As you are paying me,
I will take you anywhere you want.

100
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,310
Attention.

101
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,270
Let's go.

102
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,430
JING WU SCHOOL

103
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,030
Now that Master Huo is dead
there is no future for Jingwu School.

104
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,310
Are you sure
you don't want to try another school?

105
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,150
They are really finished.

106
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,470
5th Senior!

107
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,430
- Are you the 5th Senior?
- Biu!

108
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,390
- Let me take this.
- Thanks.

109
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,270
- You are...
- Chen Zhen of Jingwu School.

110
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,750
Jingwu School is not finished. Wait and see.

111
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,740
What are you waiting for?

112
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,590
5th Senior!

113
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,220
5th Senior!

114
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,780
Master Ngai. This is my ancestral tablet.

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,710
If you want a challenge let's go outside.

116
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,950
Master, are you alright?

117
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,830
Master Ngai. Thank you for the fight.

118
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,950
I am no match for you.

119
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,750
The victory was unjustified.

120
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,790
You must be tired from your journey.
Come later for a rematch!

121
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,390
Have you finished your studies?

122
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,310
Anyway, I am happy you are back.

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,310
Uncle Nong.

124
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,790
I was worried that this might affect your studies...

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,560
so I did not notify you about Master.
How did you hear about it?

126
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,190
It was all over the newspapers.

127
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,230
The Japs must be very happy about it.

128
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,150
Well... Let's pay our respects to my Father.

129
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,110
Wait! What are you doing?

130
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,150
He is not a Huo. He is not allowed to wear this.

131
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,630
Uncle Nong.

132
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,030
He was brought up by my father.

133
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,230
He is a part of the family.

134
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,430
Before the duel,
father's asthma was already getting worse.

135
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,860
I tried to talk him out of it,
but of course he would not listen.

136
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,870
TOLERANCE

137
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,470
Please go ahead!

138
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,590
What are you doing?
Master Huo personally made this board!

139
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,860
Uncle Nong

140
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,230
Chen Zhen is right.

141
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,710
Foreigners have been doing
whatever they wanted to do in our country.

142
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,070
That's because we have tolerated them doing it.
As long as I live

143
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,910
we won't tolerate it anymore!

144
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,510
I will look for Akutagawa.

145
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,550
Chen Zhen. You must make a challenge first.

146
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,220
Forget about it. I will go now.

147
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,470
Not even our police can enter Nijiguchi.

148
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,390
If anything happens to you,
what will become of the Jing Wu school?

149
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,230
- Even your father could not beat him.
- Uncle Nong...

150
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,830
Your father left you in my care.
I am responsible for your safety.

151
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,190
Lun, Cheung, follow Chen.

152
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,910
Notify me if anything happens.

153
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,710
- How nice!
- Get out!

154
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,950
Chief, a phone call!

155
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,950
Who is it?

156
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,430
Yes, Yuen-Kui's speaking?

157
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,790
Nong Jin-Sun.

158
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,630
Is it that serious?

159
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,420
I will be there right away.

160
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,590
We have to go to the Nijiguchi Area.

161
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,270
Two.

162
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,270
Three.

163
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,510
Four.

164
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,430
Idiots!

165
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,990
- You are like girls!
- Dismissed!

166
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,190
Who do you think you are
to walk in here with your shoes on?

167
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,070
I am Chen Zhen of Jingwu School.

168
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,580
I am looking for Akutagawa Ryuichi.

169
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,070
No Chinese are allowed in here! Get out!

170
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,990
Here is China. I can walk where I want to.

171
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,910
Bastard!

172
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,670
I don't want to fight with you.

173
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,870
Get your master out!

174
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,630
This will be a fair duel.

175
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,830
If either of us should die,
there mustn't be any vengeance!

176
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,430
My master fought you using the Huo Fist.
I shall do the same.

177
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,630
I can see that you obviously
never could have been a match for my master.

178
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,590
Master!

179
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,180
Nobody is allowed to enter except Japanese!

180
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,350
Are you sure you saw him enter?

181
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,590
I saw him go in there myself!

182
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,510
There he is!

183
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,830
Are you Japanese?

184
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,910
No.

185
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,670
Salute!

186
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,750
- What is going on?
- Nothing!

187
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,030
Mr. Fujita, Mr. Ambassador...
Everything is ok.

188
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,470
Don't create an incident!

189
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,350
Patrol one. Fall in!

190
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,420
- 5th Senior, how was the match?
- I won.

191
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,270
Bravo!

192
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,830
Ask Ting-En and Uncle Nong
to join me at Master's grave.

193
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,110
- It hasn't been sealed yet.
- That's even better.

194
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,030
Be careful.

195
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,510
What are you doing?

196
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,800
- What are they doing?
- Examining the body of Master.

197
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,110
Why did you let them do it?

198
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,270
What can I do?
Chen is a student of the Jing Wu School.

199
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,910
Chen, tell me
why are you doing this to my father?

200
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,630
Akutagawa could never have beaten Master.

201
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,830
I suspect he was poisoned.

202
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,910
Yuen-Kui,
have you ever suspected anything?

203
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,310
Master Huo was hit
by his opponent and vomitted blood.

204
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,870
Lots of people saw it.
Nothing suspicious.

205
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,460
I rather want to be called disloyal
and disrespectful than not to know the truth.

206
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,870
I must find out the truth at any cost.

207
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,830
If you want to stop me,
you better kill me right now.

208
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,270
But who did it?

209
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,350
That is for you to find out!

210
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,990
Come on everbody.
Let us bury Master with the respect he deserves.

211
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,670
The Japs could never have beaten Master so easily.

212
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,910
They will get what they deserve now!

213
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,190
Luckily 5th Senior came back in time!

214
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,190
I don't understand...
how did they poison Master?

215
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,430
For some people it is not very hard to do it...

216
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,950
Master prepared this fight for a whole month.

217
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,350
He did never get out!

218
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,870
That's right.

219
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,790
The bad guy must be among us!

220
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,430
Hsiao-Wei!

221
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,630
You brought the meals to Master?

222
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,310
Yes, why?

223
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,230
Are you suspecting her?

224
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,150
Not really.

225
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,790
I am just asking myself,
who else had access to Master's food?

226
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,980
Me!

227
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,300
I do all the cooking in this house!
Are you suspecting me?

228
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,910
Cheung, go check the kitchen for poison!

229
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,230
See if there are any dead rats in there!

230
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,030
- Calm down!
- Why don't you go check?

231
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,910
Go and see if there is anything poisonous in there!

232
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,230
Hurry up! Go!

233
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,750
Please, don't get mad!

234
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,510
I must clear my name!

235
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,710
Ting-En, what is going on?

236
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,190
Uncle was suspecting the food was poisoned
and Uncle Gun thinks we are accusing him.

237
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,230
I never said I was suspecting him!

238
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,110
Ok, very well! From now on you can eat
whatever you want, but not from me!

239
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,070
Master Huo was brought up by my cooking!

240
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,670
And you dare accuse me of poisoning him?

241
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,230
Enough now, let's eat!

242
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,510
Chen Zhen be careful, it might be poisoned.

243
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,150
Master has eaten together with all of us.

244
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,590
If your food was poisoned,
we would all be dead already!

245
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,710
That's right. Nong Jin-Sun, did you hear that?

246
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,630
Suspecting me!

247
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,390
Eat!

248
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,980
The Japs may come back for revenge,
so let's eat before they come!

249
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,070
I will visit Dr. Smith later

250
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,470
to see the analysis of the poison
that killed Master.

251
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,540
Ana... lysis?

252
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,590
Chemical analysis.

253
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,510
JING WU SCHOOL

254
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,790
- Have you seen this before?
- No!

255
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,260
- Great!
- Wonderful!

256
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,470
You are incredible.
Will you teach us some boxing too?

257
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,590
Sure! Right now?

258
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,070
Fancy moves not effective.

259
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,350
And die-hard training will help.

260
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,510
Challenge has one objective:
Beat the opponent

261
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,710
You need:
Reflexes, speed and power!

262
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,110
Simple and direct offense will work best.

263
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,710
To attack an opponent...
first learn to take an attack.

264
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,630
But we can hit him before they attack!

265
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,550
What if you don't have enough power?
You can hit him...

266
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,790
...ten times but he will not go down.

267
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,430
So you need more power.

268
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,430
Sir, they have come to learn Kung Fu.

269
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,470
Will Chen Zhen be our Master?

270
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,030
Yes, we want to learn from him!

271
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,150
He will not teach you.

272
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,310
Ting-En is the Headmaster.

273
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,510
- Four-legged form?
- Exact.

274
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,230
You look so shaky. Try a kick!

275
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,030
Where is the power?

276
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,420
Let me show you.

277
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,030
There is a form of side-kicking
in Japanese Kung Fu.

278
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,870
Go on.

279
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,430
- Simple but effective.
- Show us.

280
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,620
Get ready.

281
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,990
Are you alright?

282
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,430
Concentrate the whole power of the body
and kick sharply at the point.

283
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,390
HSIAO HUNG

284
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,790
- What's the matter?
- Please stay.

285
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,740
It's late.

286
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,750
Stay with me.

287
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,030
I am the Head Master now.
I must go back.

288
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,950
You were afraid of your father.

289
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,190
But now you can stay.
You can do what you want.

290
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,630
If someone sees me here
I will lose all respect.

291
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,220
I don't believe it.
Who would not respect Master Ting-En?

292
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,030
Please? Will you stay?

293
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,310
I have to go before dawn.

294
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,140
I want to know every move of these people.

295
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,310
But they're all Japanese!

296
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,470
There will always be ignorant
idiots who go against history.

297
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,070
Sorry, I am late.

298
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,220
Are you still scared of Chen Zhen?

299
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,190
Are you even too weak to knock the door?

300
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,860
I wanted you to rest,
that's why I did not invite you here.

301
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,830
I only have one question.

302
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,950
Did you hear about the autopsy on Master Huo?

303
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,070
You get out!

304
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,750
What's this? Secret affairs?

305
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,230
It really was you who poisoned him, wasn't it?

306
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,190
The Japanese Empire, regarding

307
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,550
technology, industrial achievement

308
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,430
and military power, is ahead of China.

309
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,590
We put our hopes in you, the warriors,

310
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,070
to break the Chinese Martial Arts Legend.

311
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,150
But you have been a big disappointment!

312
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,870
So we had to think of something.

313
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,460
Shameless!

314
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,590
It's only military strategics.

315
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,830
This is for military only!
This is no way for a samurai!

316
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,510
The match was to be fair and square!

317
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,950
You shameless bastard made me lose all respect!

318
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,230
You dare to speak of the samurai spirit?

319
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,790
Let me tell you about the samurai spirit!

320
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,950
Justice is secondary!

321
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,590
To serve the Emperor,
I will risk becoming a criminal in history.

322
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,750
This is wrong. I will show you.

323
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,110
According to Dr. Smith

324
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,670
Master was poisoned with a slowly growing drug.

325
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,830
It damaged his lung functions,
seeming like an asthmatic disease.

326
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,870
Is there a traitor at Jingwu School?

327
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,790
Chen Zhen, why did you come back?

328
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,660
Why do you ask me?

329
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,310
You have become an idol here at Jingwu School.

330
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,110
Did you ever think how Ting-En must feel?

331
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,740
I did not...

332
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,350
Since you've been back, have you ever talked
with Master Ting-En about the training?

333
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,270
You do what you want here.

334
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,990
Can you think once about
what you are doing here?

335
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,750
You are very talented,
but always bare in mind...

336
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,990
that Ting En is the Head Master
of Jingwu School!

337
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,430
It's getting late. Think about it.

338
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,910
- 5th Senior, going out?
- Yes.

339
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,670
Working so hard.

340
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,390
Master Chen!

341
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,750
Out here so early in the morning?

342
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,550
I brought some friends with me.

343
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,750
They all want to learn from you.

344
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,830
Don't follow me!

345
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,670
Overslept?

346
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,270
Master!

347
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,830
I WILL KILL ALL CRIMINALS. CHEN ZHEN.

348
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,990
Hold on! Violence is no solution!

349
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,430
General!

350
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,380
Move!

351
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,910
Good Morning master!

352
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,110
Where have you been the whole night?

353
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,630
- Where is Chen Zhen?
- He went out.

354
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,590
Tell me when he's back.

355
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,030
I am in my room.

356
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,420
The Japs are coming. Everyone out!

357
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,910
Little Master!

358
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,550
- The Japanese are here!
- Calm down.

359
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,550
Something bad will happen. Call the Police.

360
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,670
- What do you want?
- Where is Chen Zhen.

361
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,790
Chen Zhen? He is out.

362
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,070
Maybe he went beating some Japs.

363
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,220
He has a strange habit.
If he does not beat one Jap a day he feels sick.

364
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,190
Wait!

365
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,430
Chinese Bastards,
you killed Master Akutagawa.

366
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,870
You Japs only know how to blame others.

367
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,070
Enough talking.

368
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,310
We won't leave without Chen Zhen!

369
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,480
As I see you carry swords,
I know you mean business.

370
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,670
Close the doors!

371
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,660
Protect Master's shrine!

372
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,110
Hurry!

373
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,550
- Shoot the Japs!
- Stop that!

374
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,990
Draw your swords.

375
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,390
You better leave now!

376
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,830
What? Just let them go!

377
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,070
Both sides have been injured.
This straightens it out.

378
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,940
We will not leave until we have Chen Zhen.

379
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,030
Sakamoto, give me some face.

380
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,950
Who are you talking to?

381
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,270
5th Senior!

382
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,750
Don't move!

383
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,510
Old man, you will not shoot!

384
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,030
I won't. But my finger could slip...

385
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,230
Shoot the first who moves.
Take Chen Zhen away!

386
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,950
Why are you doing this?

387
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,990
Akutagawa was murdered.
We must question him.

388
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,430
- I did not do it!
- Take him away!

389
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,740
You all better leave now
or we will be forced to shoot!

390
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,030
Come on... sit down!

391
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,230
Jie is handling this case, so no need to worry.

392
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,870
Chen will be alright.

393
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,070
Why are you in this uniform?

394
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,710
This case is too big for me.
I can't do anything here.

395
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,510
And what about Chen Zhen?

396
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,470
- Let Fate decide it.
- Fate? Wait!

397
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,630
Captain, you have four witnesses, don't you?

398
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,790
Yes, our Police Department has four witnesses

399
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,750
who all claim to have seen Chen Zhen kill a man.

400
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,790
Strange. Where did they come from?

401
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,590
I saw Chen Zhen with my own eyes.

402
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,270
There is no way it wasn't him!

403
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,190
It's true! I saw him stab the deceased with a knife!

404
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,540
It's him. He killed the murdered with an axe!

405
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,150
How many fingers can you see?

406
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,830
Two.

407
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,940
No no no, four!

408
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,070
Could you come a little bit closer?

409
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,150
No need.

410
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,350
That's ridiculous!

411
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,030
I was at Jingwu School with my fellow students.

412
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,460
They can speak for me.

413
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,870
Your Honour,

414
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,190
the Jingwu Students cannot be taken as witnesses,
as they are very close to him.

415
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,470
What are you talking!

416
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,110
Your witness has just arrived.

417
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,390
Your Honour, I have another witness to present!

418
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,990
I don't think a Chinese witness can be heard!

419
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,990
My witness is Japanese!

420
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,950
Japanese?

421
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,630
Miss, please identify yourself.

422
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,750
I am Yamada Mitsuko.
The daughter of Yamada Mitsuo.

423
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,510
Minister of Education.

424
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,990
Chen Zhen said he was at Jingwu School
at the night of the murder.

425
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,790
Can you confirm this?

426
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,590
He is lying.

427
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,350
He spent the whole night with me in my motel room.

428
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,750
He did not leave...

429
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,030
- The whole night?
- Yes.

430
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,750
What did she say?

431
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,270
What if he sneaked out while you were sleeping?

432
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,470
That is impossible!

433
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,550
We didn't sleep the whole night...

434
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,950
We were busy doing other things.

435
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,590
What things were you doing if not sleeping?

436
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,070
What else can you do in a bed...

437
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,110
when you don't sleep in it?

438
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,630
- What did she say?
- No idea, and you?

439
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,630
The Japanese said,
she slept with Chen Zhen the whole night.

440
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,510
Are you sure?

441
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,550
Congratulations.

442
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,350
Let's go.

443
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,350
The Chinese Hero is nothing but a womanizer!

444
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,790
How come you are here?

445
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,150
I have abandoned everything for you.
Now you must take care of me!

446
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,950
Cook for her? Don't even think about it!

447
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,190
Chen Zhen, your Master sent you to Japan
to learn new technologies.

448
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,510
To beat the Japs with knowledge.

449
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,470
Never forget your Master's wishes
because of a woman!

450
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,870
What will we do now?

451
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,110
Jingwu School does not want
to be linked to the Japanese in any way.

452
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,950
Chen Zhen

453
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,300
You are a student of Jingwu.
You can't have affairs with Japanese here.

454
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,430
Chen Zhen, did I cause you any trouble here?

455
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,310
It's alright.

456
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,830
You should not worry about getting a wife.

457
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,070
A hero should not be sentimental.

458
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,710
You want to destroy your life for this woman?

459
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,390
Uncle Nong,
Mitsuko has given up everything to help me.

460
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,310
And she testified in court for me,
what can she do now?

461
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,840
Maybe that's how Jap woman behave?

462
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,500
Here at Jingwu, we can't tolerate any Japs,
whoever it may be.

463
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,830
It's your choice. Either you leave the woman

464
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,510
or you leave Jing Wu School.

465
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,830
Little Master,
you obviously want to kick 5th Senior out!

466
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,550
What is it, are you with the Japs now?

467
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,670
- You want to frame me?
- Why are you talking trash then!

468
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,870
- Say that again!
- Then what?

469
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,910
Enough!

470
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,950
Chen Zhen

471
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,230
If this goes on, Jingwu School will be finished.

472
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,990
I don't want any in-fighting because of this.

473
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,510
There is only one solution...

474
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,440
To see who is Head Master of Jingwu School!

475
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,710
Once and for all.

476
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,030
I don't want to be the Head Master!

477
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,430
I don't care what you think.

478
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,630
Here are some students who don't want
to listen to me anymore!

479
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,830
I will challenge you now
to see who is worthy of being the Head Master.

480
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,590
If you win, you must become the Head Master
and this woman mustn't leave.

481
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,550
Little Master!

482
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,230
Beat the Jap friend out of Jingwu School!

483
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,990
Little Master!

484
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,430
Are you alright?

485
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,750
Are you ok?

486
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,270
I lost. You are the Head Master.

487
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,870
I don't want to be.

488
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,190
I will not seperate from Mitsuko.

489
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,670
If I have to make the choice...

490
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,750
I will leave Jingwu School.

491
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,350
Are you going back to Shangtung?
It's chaotic there!

492
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,550
Mitsuko, wait here.

493
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,550
Boss, any rooms?

494
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,950
Yes, please enter.

495
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,430
They have a room.

496
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,790
A Japanese? Impossible!

497
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,190
She is my wife, please let us stay.

498
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,590
- Isn't that Chen Zhen?
- Damn Japanese traitor!

499
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,630
Jingwu traitor!

500
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,040
You are harming my business. Leave!

501
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,910
Let's go.

502
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,790
GRAVE OF HUO YUEN-JIA

503
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,150
A mouse! On the furniture!

504
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,580
A mouse?

505
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,790
- Where?
- I saw it over there, really!

506
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,710
It's gone.

507
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,830
Mice like such places very much.

508
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,630
I don't like this place. It scares me.

509
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,950
They were here first. In fact we scare them!

510
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,460
I think you are right.

511
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,110
I am very sorry...
To live with me in such a lousy hideout.

512
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,750
After all it's a nice place.

513
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,510
Wonderful landscape.
Much better than in any hotel room!

514
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,750
Is that what you want?
Let's move to a place like this then!

515
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,790
Are you giving up Jingwu School then?

516
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,710
Jingwu School has given up on me.

517
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,480
After all, at least I can relax without this burden.

518
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,510
This doesn't sound like Chen Zhen.

519
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,990
Why?

520
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,830
You are lying to yourself.
You can't live without Jingwu School.

521
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,750
How can you relax!

522
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,110
Chen Zhen is lying.
Mitsuko has found out the truth!

523
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,150
Really?

524
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,590
Uncle Nong, have some Tea.

525
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,990
Thanks. Have you eaten yet?

526
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,070
I am not hungry.

527
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,550
Ting-En still hasn't returned?

528
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,350
He has a hard time,
he's never lost a fight before.

529
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,120
The match against Chen Zhen
must have been a great burden for him.

530
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,070
He has a bad temper.
Maybe he is not willing to come back.

531
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,910
But who can be the Head Master then?

532
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,350
Huo's Michung Fist must stay in the family!

533
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,310
How can Master rest in peace
if nobody carries on with it?

534
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,510
Who is teaching at the moment?

535
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,830
Cheung and Biu.

536
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,150
What should we do if a challenger arrives?

537
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,470
My mother wrote a letter.

538
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,470
It says that Jingwu offended the Japanese.

539
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,630
She asks me to leave here.

540
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,580
So what? Will you leave?

541
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,630
I don't know what to do!

542
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,300
Don't worry. This is still British territory!

543
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,310
The Japanese can't enter here, can they?

544
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,150
You Chinese love to waste everything?

545
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,430
Two serving for one table!

546
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,390
What is it?

547
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,470
I want to see your Head Master.

548
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,550
He is not here. What do you want?

549
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,830
The champion of the the Black Dragon Clan,
Master Funakoshi Fumio

550
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,950
wants to challenge your Head Master.

551
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,590
What are we going to do now?

552
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,070
- Find Ting-En!
- Useless, better find Chen Zhen!

553
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,420
We don't want a traitor!

554
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,750
- Mind your words!
- Isn't he a traitor?

555
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,910
Stop it! Don't argue!
This will lead us nowhere!

556
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,110
Find Little Master! Hurry up!

557
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,070
Uncle Gun...

558
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,830
Cheung.

559
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,310
- Where did Little Master go?
- How do I know?

560
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,980
What's up Uncle Gun?

561
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,310
Don't pretend! Where is my son?

562
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,390
We can talk about this at night.

563
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,950
You said if I poison Master Huo
you will release my son!

564
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,110
Listen, it isn't that easy!

565
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,110
Your son is a convicted murderer in Shangtung!

566
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,070
You promised!

567
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,110
Did I promise? The Japs said that!

568
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,460
My daughter-in-law told me

569
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,270
that my son was already killed in the prison!

570
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,780
You already killed Huo,
so what can you do about it?

571
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,390
Besides we paid you very well!

572
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,430
You didn't hesitate when we gave you the money?

573
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,380
If the Japs promised you,
your son is surely alright!

574
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,430
Now stop the talking about this matter!

575
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,190
You told me the drug will not kill Master Huo.

576
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,470
If I had known that beforehand,
I would rather have let my son die.

577
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,630
Help!

578
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,630
Uncle Gun has commited suicide!

579
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,590
Help me get him down! Quick!

580
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,590
Help me! Hurry up!

581
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,070
We found this under his body!

582
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,310
What is it?

583
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,540
This is for Master's asthma,
Tien-En's friend brought it from Nang Yeung.

584
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,510
Hey! Master Huo was the only one at Jingwu
to eat this!

585
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,790
Gun could have used this food
for poisoning Master Huo...

586
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,910
Then he felt too guilty and commited suicide.

587
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,110
He is already dead.
Please don't make it public.

588
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,910
If people hear of this,
it will hurt Jingwu's reputation even more.

589
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,750
Jingwu will perish anyway, no matter what!

590
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,910
Chen Zhen has left, Ting-En has disappeared.

591
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,630
You need a new Head Master,
and this very soon!

592
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,390
Where have we come to?

593
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,350
What would Master Huo say about all this?

594
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,790
Captain, what shall we do?

595
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,230
You are the Captain today, why ask me?

596
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,790
Please help me out.

597
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,740
Take this stuff for analysis.

598
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,310
Please help me look for Ting-En.

599
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,230
I will, don't worry!

600
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,030
Miss, are you looking for someone?

601
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,310
Please tell me, is Nong Jin-Sun here?

602
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,910
He is inside, please follow me.

603
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,550
Uncle Nong, this Lady wants to see you.

604
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,710
What is it?

605
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,910
Ting-En is at my place!

606
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,030
He refuses to come back here,
no matter what I say.

607
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,110
Where is he? Can you bring me there?

608
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,710
- Dizzy Star House.
- A brothel?

609
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,910
What's your relation with Ting-En?

610
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,580
I know him for two years.

611
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,270
He must have spent lots of money on you.

612
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,110
Don't worry. I will leave him.

613
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,300
Ting-En isn't as bad as you may think now.

614
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,350
He always hoped to establish Jingwu School.

615
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,950
He told me he wants it to be better
than it was under his father.

616
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,780
This is the truth.

617
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,150
Uncle Nong, you have to help him!

618
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,110
Beat him!

619
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,670
Let me fight them! Let me go!

620
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,350
Let me go!

621
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,670
Little Master!

622
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,750
Sing, Biu, let's go home.

623
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,230
What are you doing here?
Something wrong with Jingwu?

624
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,710
The Nijiguchi School has challengend Jingwu.

625
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,670
What about Chen Zhen?

626
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,740
The Head Master must meet the challenge.

627
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,750
Not Chen Zhen.

628
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,750
Forget it. Let's go.

629
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,060
Wait!

630
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,750
I will go with you.

631
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,910
You think you can make it?

632
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,990
I won't let people look down on Jingwu School,
even if I should lose!

633
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,100
One moment!

634
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,990
What about this lady?

635
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,750
You can't leave her here all alone.

636
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,030
This is no way to treat a woman.

637
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,470
Get the chief.

638
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,310
I want you to bail her out!

639
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,910
Hsiao-Hung, won't you miss your shiny dresses?

640
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,910
It's an honour that I can dress like you do!

641
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,590
This cloth looks old.
I will find you new ones tomorrow.

642
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,710
I've checked.

643
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,830
Funakoshi Fumio is the number one warrior
of the Black Dragon Clan.

644
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,870
But he is too old.

645
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,430
Uncle Nong.

646
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,190
Now you look decent!

647
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,950
You better use your real name from now on, So-Lan.

648
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,070
Why didn't you treat Mitsuko the same way?

649
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,940
That's different. Mitsuko is Japanese.

650
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,310
Ting-En, we only have 10 days until the duel.

651
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,470
Thanks. Biu, go on.

652
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,030
You treat Ting-En very well.

653
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,630
Everybody's treated the same way.

654
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,000
Is his Kung Fu the best at Jingwu School?

655
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Yes

656
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,590
What about Chen Zhen?

657
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,710
They are equal.

658
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,670
Sorry, Little Master.

659
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,670
Are you ok?

660
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,750
Go on.

661
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,950
What's wrong with him?
He seems to be somewhere else.

662
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,990
BLACK DRAGON CLAN FUNAKOSHI FUMIO

663
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,550
Spirit Table of Akutagawa Ryuichi

664
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,310
Master Funakoshi,
we have sent the ultimatum to the Jingwu School.

665
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,350
Make sure that I chose my opponents.

666
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,310
And not the military.

667
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,110
Have you got that?

668
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,150
All the expenses of the Black Dragon Clan in China

669
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,870
are paid by the Japanese army.

670
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,790
That does not matter.

671
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,560
You can leave the Black Dragon Clan if you want to.

672
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,990
Your chairman won't agree to this.

673
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,620
Don't try to opress me with the chairman.

674
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,510
I am only a martial arts master.

675
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,790
Not a politician.

676
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,430
CHALLENGE

677
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,590
Already awake?

678
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,060
Good Morning.

679
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,030
Are you Master Funakoshi?

680
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,470
Uncle Funakoshi?

681
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,470
Mitsukotu, why do you live so far away?

682
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,630
I would have taken a carriage
if I had known before!

683
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,110
Did father send you?

684
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,910
I haven't seen your father for a long time.

685
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,990
Then why are you here?

686
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,110
Because of him.

687
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,830
Chen Zhen?

688
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,430
Are you two married?

689
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,030
No.

690
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,150
But aren't you living together?

691
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,110
Neither Chinese nor Japanese
would accept if we married.

692
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,870
Lucky you aren't married.

693
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,230
If he dies, you won't be a widow.

694
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,470
What did you say?

695
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,990
If you should die,
I will send your ashes back to Japan.

696
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,030
Young Man, you are quite confident.

697
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,710
You want to fight? Why didn't you tell me before?

698
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,590
Men don't have to tell everything to women.

699
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,230
Chen Zhen, come.

700
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,030
Tell me, what is the most powerful stroke?

701
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,310
Concentrate all your energy
on one focal point, then hit!

702
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,630
This is really powerful.

703
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,110
But stones don't hit back like humans do.

704
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,230
What will be the most powerful stroke then?

705
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,150
Enough theories. Let's do some practice.

706
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,470
How about the best defence?

707
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:57,990
Attack!

708
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,830
Why waste energy defending,
when you can attack?

709
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,190
Strike the opponent
in the shortest time possible!

710
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,390
Huo style seems similar to Karate.

711
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,710
Based on attacking first.

712
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,390
You don't understand, do you?

713
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,310
Hard without soft only wastes energy.

714
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,310
Soft without hard can't strike either.

715
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,470
Old Master, how do you teach your students?

716
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,870
Has your master taught you that?

717
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,430
Bad temper is the weak point in a match.

718
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,870
Young Man, you will lose with this attitude!

719
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,390
My master never talked that much.
Are you going to fight?

720
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,750
Wait!

721
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,380
Wait!

722
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,630
I am old. I must warm up a bit first.

723
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,230
What kind of style is this?

724
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,430
Don't ask. If it wins, it's a good one!

725
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:43,990
Are your eyes alright?

726
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,670
I'm fine.

727
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,430
I don't want to take any advantage.

728
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,870
It's over!

729
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,870
Are you alright?

730
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,430
It's not easy to be so young and so talented!

731
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,630
Very rare!

732
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,150
You have much energy for such an age!

733
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,430
Chinese say:

734
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,990
"The Old fear the strength of the Youth"
It's true.

735
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,830
But, I have lost!

736
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,190
I adopted your fighting style.

737
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,420
Chinese martial arts always emphasize
on personal well-being.

738
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,430
Not the battles. You actually surprised me.

739
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,870
The objective of matching is to beat the opponent.

740
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,110
Wrong, young man.

741
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,270
The best way to beat the opponent
is to do it with a gun.

742
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,230
The goal of Kung Fu is to maximize one's energy

743
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,590
and to develop a higher physical level.

744
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,100
To achieve that,
you must understand life and the universe.

745
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,950
Never forget that.

746
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,110
I have to go. Take care.

747
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,990
Aren't we fighting?

748
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,310
Fighting is for animals.

749
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,550
The fight ended in a draw.

750
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,030
However,
I am not representing all Japanese warriors.

751
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,990
In Japan,
there are many even more powerful than me.

752
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,230
Master, aren't you the best in Japan?

753
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,060
To say he is the best,
is to speak of his wisdom.

754
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,310
Not his expertise in killing.

755
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,990
Master Huo Yuen Jia, I have lost.

756
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,950
I never would have expected you
to have such a good student.

757
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,910
Now, the best at the Nijiguchi

758
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,070
is Fujita Gou, called the "Killing Machine".

759
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,790
Young Man, take care of yourself.

760
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,310
I have won!

761
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,110
Your Go skills have improved.

762
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,470
Too bad life is not as easy as a Go game.

763
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,470
Only a few years ago,
Dr. Sun Yat Sen was a good friend of the Kokuryo.

764
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,190
Now they have changed.

765
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,030
Just like the military...

766
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,230
...they want to conquer China.

767
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,270
Conquer China?

768
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,390
They are daydreaming.

769
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,910
It's not a dream!

770
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,310
The Japanese army based in China

771
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,750
has already more than half of
China's military strength.

772
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,030
I learned from you already

773
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,620
that Japan is now like a very strong ant

774
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,590
which wants to eat a sleeping elephant.

775
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,550
While the Elephant sleeps,
the ant seems to gain some advantage.

776
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,110
But once the elephant wakes up,
the ant has no chance!

777
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,070
Don't you agree on that?

778
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,350
But as I see it

779
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,110
the elephant is still asleep.

780
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,430
Thus, there is more than one
ant looking for a chance...

781
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,590
The elephant will wake up.

782
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,870
Of course. Too bad...

783
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,790
that most of the Japanese
won't believe you or me.

784
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,790
For the past decades

785
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,270
Japan received the majority of benefit
from winning wars.

786
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,150
Japan wishes to become a strong Empire.

787
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,070
People like General Fujita

788
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,830
are not seldom in Japan.

789
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,830
Seeing all these factors...

790
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,710
a war seems unevitable!

791
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:34,790
You are back!

792
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,350
Good evening.

793
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,430
- Where is Chen Zhen?
- He is out.

794
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,390
Have a seat.

795
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,150
Have some tea.

796
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,830
Thanks.

797
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,870
You learned to speak Chinese?

798
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,020
A little.

799
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,550
You speak well.

800
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,150
Chen, you are back!
Mr. Huo is here to see you.

801
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,580
Where have you been? Keeping you busy?

802
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,030
I found a job in the telegram station.

803
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,620
- Did you really give up Jingwu?
- Doesn't matter now.

804
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,750
As I am not at Jingwu School,

805
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,510
my current job is meaningful too.

806
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,150
Jingwu needs you to come back.

807
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,230
I also brought Hsiao-Hung back.

808
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,230
From the Dizzy Star?

809
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,670
Haven't you met her?

810
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,590
Congratulations!

811
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,470
You can bring Mitsuko along to Jingwu.

812
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,750
She is Japanese.

813
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,070
They won't accept her...

814
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,430
She has done so much for you.
She is a nice girl.

815
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,710
But what would outsiders say?

816
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,030
Jingwu School's reputation would be affected.

817
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,110
I can't be so selfish.

818
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,230
I've learned a new style lately.

819
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,390
- Which one?
- Let me show you.

820
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,000
It's like the Huo Fist!

821
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,350
Yes. It's the Huo Michung Fist.

822
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,980
Master said this style
is not for others but for Huos.

823
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,630
This is to be kept among Jingwu forever.

824
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,430
Chen Zhen, promise me.

825
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,750
I have to go to the challenge tomorrow.

826
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,790
If anything happens to me...
teach it to the others at Jingwu School for me.

827
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,990
Sorry, I decided to leave immediately.

828
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,430
There are things in life
more important than love.

829
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,230
While I am not with you
you can achieve even more.

830
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,990
Fulfil your promise to Ting-En.
When the Japanese army returns to Japan,

831
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,190
I will wait for you in Kyoto.

832
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,550
I will take only Lun with me.

833
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,550
Ting-En, I am very worried.

834
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,190
Don't you need more people?

835
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,830
Nothing to worry.
The Japs will think we are scared if more people go.

836
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,660
Right. Wait for me.

837
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,190
Hsiao-Wei, please take care of Hsiao Hong.

838
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,950
Ting-En!

839
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,270
I can speak Japanese, let me help you!

840
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,190
Let's go!

841
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,190
They are going together.
It will be alright now.

842
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,590
General, Master Fumio
left for Shanghai early this morning.

843
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,670
Stubborn old man!

844
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,550
If he doesn't cooperate,
he is the enemy of the military.

845
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,750
Send the news to Tokyo!

846
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,950
General, should we cancel the challenge
with the Jingwu School?

847
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,910
No. We don't have to rely
on the Kokuryo Clan anymore.

848
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,140
I will handle Jingwu myself.

849
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,790
Both of you are here. Excellent!

850
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:57,070
Mr. Huo, I have good news for you.
We found the Murderer.

851
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,700
Come in!

852
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,830
He was bribed...

853
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,750
...to put the poison in your father's food.

854
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,550
He is a traitor.

855
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,910
No need to be afraid. Take him out.

856
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,220
Nobody is allowed to enter without my order.

857
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,790
Everybody out!

858
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,910
SICK MAN OF ASIA

859
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,030
If you lose, I will give this sign to you.

860
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,070
It's my personal hand-writing.

861
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,110
Catch!

862
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,310
Can you walk?

863
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,620
Don't move!

864
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:31,990
General.

865
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,670
Mr. Ambassador, General Fujita is dead.

866
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,910
Don't move or we will shoot!

867
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,150
Take it easy!

868
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:53,230
- You ok?
- Yes.

869
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,110
You are only the police
for the Brittish territory.

870
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:03,470
I am not here as a policeman,
I am here as a Chinese!

871
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,830
Chen and Huo will be brought back by us!

872
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,070
What? You think you can leave here safely?

873
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,620
Don't move!

874
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,350
Just try it, you even will die before me!

875
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:17,310
Stop this!

876
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,070
Everybody put down your weapons!

877
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:26,470
I am sure we somehow
can solve this peacefully.

878
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,150
Fujita is already dead.

879
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,310
It is not neccessary
to sacrifice anymore lives for him.

880
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,190
- Lieutenant!
- Yes!

881
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,310
Take your men out of here.

882
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,230
Mr. Ambassador!

883
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,870
I am the highest official here.

884
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,790
Do you want to disobey my order?

885
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,950
Attention. Fall out!

886
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,710
Mr. Jie...

887
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,860
A Japanese officer has been killed.

888
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,710
I need the murderer
for the governmental report.

889
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,350
You must understand that.

890
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,150
Otherwise,
the Japanese military won't give up on this.

891
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:15,270
So, if I don't die,
the military will make use of this to start a war?

892
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,670
In this case, I will sacrifice myself.

893
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:34,390
Great! You are a real hero!

894
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,030
Back off. Nothing to see here.

895
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,830
Looks like Chen Zhen.

896
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,910
Is he dead?

897
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,990
Why does the police treat the Japs so friendly?

898
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,110
It's not their fault. They are all the same.

899
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,030
They are working together to bully the Chinese.

900
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:32,030
All they can do is bully the Chinese!

901
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,180
Chen Zhen was a real hero!

902
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:41,070
He beat all his enemies in the Nijiguchi Area.

903
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,230
It was fantastic!

904
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,990
Too bad he had to die at such a young age.

905
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,750
- What is it?
- Nothing. Keep on talking!

906
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:03,310
To imagine Cheung was the traitor. He was so nice.

907
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,230
At least he was of use as Chens replacement body.

908
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,110
5th Senior, were are we heading?

909
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,710
Which part of China would a battle
with Japan take place first?
