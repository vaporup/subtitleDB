<i>Houston, this is Excursion.</i>

2
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,393
<i>We see a good

<i>Excursion, this is Houston.</i>

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,468
<i>We copy and concur.
Good 0-1 burn.</i>

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,072
<i>Houston, can you confirm
good K.U. antenna coverage</i>

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,719
<i>for lander deploy?</i>

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,399
<i>INCO, this is the flight director.</i>

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,398
<i>How is our K.U.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,396
<i>Flight, this is INCO.</i>

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,717
<i>We should have good K.U. coverage
all the way through L.D.S. release.</i>

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,310
<i>In fact, we're covered all the way
through the landing and air lock egress.</i>

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,276
<i>Houston, stack going
to minus Z-L-V.</i>

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,760

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,560

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,749
De-orbit burn in progress.

20
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,600
<i>Flight, Rendezvous.
Excursion sep maneuver is nominal.</i>

21
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,799
<i>Lander, this is Houston.
We show nominal de-orbit.</i>

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,149
Looks pretty good from this end.

23
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,599
The eagle has landed...

24
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,432
again.

25
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,956
Way to go! Yes!

26
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,311
Houston, we have touchdown
at M.E.T...

27

I'm there.

34
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,314
Set P.E.T. countdown.

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,796
It's one hour
till party time, baby.

36

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,673
<i>We're with you, Patrick.</i>

41
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,588
<i>Houston, Excursion.
Deploying rover two.</i>

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,834
<i>We confirm rover two's telemetry

43
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,110
<i>Excursion, this is Houston.</i>

44
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,712
<i>Are you receiving rover one's carrier
signal through the landers uplink?</i>

45
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,436
<i>That's affirm, Houston. We expect
excellent video from rover one.</i>

46
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,878
<i>Not for one nation...</i>

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,318
<i>not for one people...</i>

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,638
<i>not for one creed...</i>

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,271
<i>but for all humankind.</i>

<i>son of a senator, football star at Yale,

52
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,072
<i>A perfect hero
for these imperfect times.</i>

53
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,475
<i>Patrick, this is Excursion.</i>

54
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,717
<i>I need you to check rover two's
next drilling site for me.</i>

55
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,677
<i>Patrick, would you take a look
at your primary O-2...</i>

56
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,836
<i>and power levels on your D.C.M.</i>

57
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,996
<i>Suit parameters all look good.</i>

58
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,995
<i>Structure around is loamy.</i>

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,110
<i>Loose topsoil is rock.
Drill bit shows signs of wear and tear.</i>

60
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,070
It'll last. One more area.

61
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,157
Sector 112, okay?

62
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,757
It might have been
a canal bed.

63
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,632
<i>Eight years of training,
and I'm a Martian ditchdigger.</i>

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,789
You have 1 hour, 30 minutes
surface time left.

65
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,316
And counting.

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,956
<i>Final sample loaded.
Prepping for air lock ingress.</i>

67
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,960
<i>In a world beset by violence,
hunger and strife...</i>

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,799
<i>there are occasions
when mankind surpasses...</i>

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,514
<i>the petty struggles
of daily existence.</i>

70
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,309
<i>The Excursion voyage to Mars
is one of those occasions.</i>

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,715
<i>Today America is proud.</i>

72
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,911
I told them not to go!

73
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,149
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

74
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,678
Let's get you out of here.

75
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,233
Oh, my God.
It was incredible.

76
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,558
<i>A tremendous achievement
that once again proves...</i>

77
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,196
<i>that if we can rise above
partisan politics...</i>

78
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,512
<i>America can climb to the heavens.</i>

79
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,914
Thank you, Mr. President.
The credit goes to my crew.

80
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,075
<i>Fly home safe, son.
Our prayers are with you and...</i>

81
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,514
<i>God bless you.</i>

82
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,913
Thank you, Mr. President.

83
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,194
<i>Flight, Nav. We'd like the crew
to take a star tracker pass...</i>

84
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,234
<i>and perform an I.M.U. alignment
before we update the state vector.</i>

85
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,589
<i>CAPCOM, let the crew know Navigation
wants a fix on a star position...</i>

86
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,552
<i>and alignment of
the interior moment unit...</i>

87
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,354
<i>before putting a new
state vector on board.</i>

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,829
Houston, this is Excursion.
We have your new state vector on board.

89
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,113
<i>Excursion, Houston. We copy you.

<i>Excursion, you are good to go.</i>

93
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,193
Thanks, Huston.
Thirty seconds to transfer orbit TIG.

94
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,831
We're homeward bound, baby.

95
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,234
Yes, sirs!

96
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,670

<i>Excursion, this is Houston calling.
Do you read us? Over.</i>

111
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,589
<i>Excursion, this is Houston.
Do you copy?</i>

112
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,430
<i>For the past three minutes...</i>

113
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,194
<i>every attempt to communicate
with the Excursion has failed.</i>

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,036
I told 'em not to go to Mars!

115
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,758
I told 'em not to go!

116
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,320
<i>G.C., Flight. Check all relay
stations on the network.</i>

117
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,715
<i>Have the backup TDRS

118
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,039
<i>Flight to all operators.

119
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,800
<i>Get with your back rooms.

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,355
<i>For God's sake, somebody
tell me she didn't blow.</i>

121
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,919
Houston, this is Excursion.

122
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,876
We had a malfunction
in the K.U. band antenna.

123
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,513
Lost telemetry and comm.

124
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,756
I performed a bit of I.F.M.
Seems to be okay now.

125
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,319
Excursion crew is okay.

126
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,190
Headed for rendezvous
with Big Blue.

127
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,951
It's gonna be good to get home.
Over and out.

128
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,911
The Extraterrestrial
Vulnerability Experiment...

129
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,951
has one central goal:

130
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,909
to discover a means
to defend ourselves...

131
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,476
against the alien species
should they ever return to Earth.

132
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,719
Now, as you know, gentlemen,
Eve was re-created

133
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,512
from a frozen lab embryo.

134
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,154
She's a genetic duplicate
of the original Sil.

135
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,674
Now, we have deliberately
shielded Eve...

136
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,713
from any direct contact
with the male gender...

137
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,037
which is why, gentlemen,
you're inside there.

138
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,432
So...

139
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,355
proceed.

140
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,151
Help!

141
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,477
Laura! Please!

142
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,038
Okay, that's enough.
Bring her up.

143
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,759
Bingo, Dr. Baker!

144
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,470
It worked!

145
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,269
Take a look at those
beautiful welts.

146
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,716
Just beautiful.

147
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,312
What happened, Dr. Baker?

148
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,799
Our problem in a nutshell:
A toxic agent works once...

149
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,029
but then it becomes useless
once the alien's biology adapts.

150
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,637
You've gone out of your way
to give this... this lab animal...

151
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,718
a living situation
that's fit for a queen!

152
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,589
I suggest you spend more time
finding a way to 86 the damn thing.

153
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,958
Colonel, you're welcome
to replace me anytime you like.

154
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,435
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

155
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,916
Tell Dr. Baker
we must continue testing.

156
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,189
Aye, aye, sir.

157
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,511
Why do you do this to me?

158
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,433
I'm sorry, Eve.

159
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,958
I've explained to you
why we've got to do this...

160
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,355
what happened
with the first Sil.

161
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,872
And why you have to be prepared.

162
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,150
Survival of the fittest.
I know.

163
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,237
I watch this TV...

164
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,271
and I see all the places
I'm never gonna go...

165
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,915
and see all the people
I'm never gonna meet.

166
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,549
Is that all I am to you?

167
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,112
A laboratory animal?

168
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,389
I want you to understand
that the reason I took this job...

169
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,513
was to make sure that these experiments
were done with regard for you.

170
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,836
Just don't forget
that I'm human too.

171
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,592
<i>Main gear touchdown.</i>

172
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,875
<i>Shuttle ground support vehicles
with flight surgeon and medical team...</i>

173
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,150
<i>in the crew recovery vehicle
are en route.</i>

174
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,434
Thanks, Houston.
It's good to be home.

175
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,953
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

176
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,231
On preliminary examination, all three
of you are in remarkable health...

177
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,831
though, of course, I'll continue
more specific blood testing.

178
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,114
We do have a few people here
who would like a further examination.

179
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,437
Boy, there's enough fine booty
out there to cure what ails me.

180
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,273
You're under quarantine,
Mr. Gamble.

181
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,948
No sexual activity
for at least ten days.

182
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,240
- And that means all of you.
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

183
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,313
No, I'm not kidding.

184
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,954
<i>Back when President Kennedy
began the space program...</i>

185
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,789
I was just a very young
assistant up on the Hill.

186
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,912
It didn't take me long to realize
that he was a visionary...

187
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,958
and that I shared that vision.

188
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,192
Later on,
when I became a senator...

189
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,075
I was determined to push our program
even further into space.

190
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,752
And so today,
Jack Kennedy's vision...

191
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,669
is maintained by the commitment
of American business.

192
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,073
But I like to think
that his spirit is embodied...

193
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,555
in young men like Patrick Ross.

194
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,751
- When Patrick was five years old...
- What happened to Patrick?

195
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,113
I don't know, but he's missing some
major butt-kissing from his own father.

196
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,437
He hasn't been feeling
very well tonight.

197
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,359
Tell you the truth, I haven't
been feeling so great either.

198
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,394
Yeah, I think what we all need
is a little tender loving care.

199
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,632
So it's with pleasure that I introduce
one of our finest young leaders,

200
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,277
the captain of the Mars mission,

201
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,917
and my son, Patrick Ross.

202
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,149
I've gotta go.

203
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,193
Lincoln suite, upstairs.
Hurry.

204
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,036
Captain Ross, everyone's
waiting. This way, sir.

205
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,229
Nice of you to show up.

206
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,953
Thank you all
for coming out this evening.

207
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,549
Thank you, Father,

208
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,274
for what I'm sure
were overly kind words.

209
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,557
I've been chosen
on behalf of my wonderful crew...

210
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,913
to represent
the mission to Mars...

211
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,312
and an image
that comes to my mind...

212
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,674
is looking through the porthole...

213
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,513
at the blue-white globe...

214
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,595
beautiful...

215
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,872
so fragile, so small.

216
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,152
And I thought to myself...

217
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,355
how easy it would be to destroy
all that God has created.

218
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,830
I think, as we look
to the future...

219
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,836
our greatest mission
might be right here at home.

220
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,274
It's open.

221
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,036
Come on in.

222
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,597
My sister decided to join us.

223
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,592
We share everything...

224
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,876
together.

225
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,279
<i>Parker's going for two,
and he's in there, standing!</i>

226
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,315
Pulse rate is 20 percent
below human norm.

227
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,235
What do you expect, Brea?
She's watching baseball.

228
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,871
Oh, God!

229
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,758
You are a hero.

230
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,468
Oh, God.

231
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,834
It's my turn.

232
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,235
Yes, it is.

233
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,674
<i>Here it comes!
Parker's going for three!</i>

234
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,558
Jeez! Did someone hit a home run?

235
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,351
My God, help me!

236
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,308
Get off me!

237
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,156
Marcy! Get him off me!

238
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,718
Oh, my God!

239
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,471
Help me, someone!

240
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,435
- What the hell is going on?
- My God!

241
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,997
Last night,
after the fund-raiser...

242
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,599
something happened.

243
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,269
I try to think about it,
I draw a total blank.

244
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,277
They always make those drinks
at those fund-raisers strong.

245
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,431
That's the way they get
the wallets to open up.

246
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,791
Billy, you tell that old son-of-a-bitch
I won't take no for an answer.

247
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,991
There's something wrong with me,
Dad, since I got back.

248
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,955
Do you think
a trip to Mars was rough?

249
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,278
You just wait till you try
a senate campaign.

250
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,757
Dad, listen to me.
I'm having...

251
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,511
I'm having
some kind of breakdown.

252
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,034
Stop thinking about the master plan
and help me, all right? I'm scared.

253
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,916
Goddamn it!
Quit acting like a spoiled child.

254
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,196
You're a Ross.
Behave like one.

255
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,669
And I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice, boy.

256
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,992
You keep your dick in your pants
and your eyes on the prize.

257
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,993
<i>Oh, I know what you been doin',
and frankly, I don't give a damn.</i>

258
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,158
But I have seen too many young men
with promising careers...

259
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,392
piss it all away
on a piece of ass.

260
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,593
People love you, Patrick.
Hell, boy, they idolize you.

261
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,228
You're gonna be President
of the United States someday.

262
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,872
Now, let's take a walk
through the gallery.

263
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,196
Some of my illustrious colleagues
are just dyin' to get your autograph.

264
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,430
Yes, sir.

265
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,718
Yes, it's very important
that I speak with Herman Cromwell.

266
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,878
No, he's a patient there.

267
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,956
<i>Well, can I get a message to him
that Dr. Orinsky called</i>

268
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,714
<i>from the lab at Oldham Space Center
up in Maryland?</i>

269
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,556
<i>Yes, it's very important
that I speak to him.</i>

270
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,671
<i>I'm an old colleague of his.</i>

271
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,278
I can't believe this.

272
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,633
Oh, my God!

273
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,671
Company, halt! Left, left...

274
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,189
<i>The substance found</i>

275
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,911
<i>in Dr. Orinsky's wounds
is combinant alien-human DNA.</i>

276
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,358
<i>This DNA is structurally
similar to Eve's...</i>

277
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,319
but it's not a perfect match.

278
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,750
Obviously, Eve
has not left the compound...

279
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,919
which means, gentlemen,
that there's another one out there.

280
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,229
None of our intelligence suggests
that a foreign power was involved.

281
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,672
How do we start looking
for this thing?

282
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,994
Well, I would suggest
normal investigative procedure...

283
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,829
to cultivate a list of possible suspects
and then test their blood.

284
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,109
Thank you, Dr. Baker. We may ask you
to help us track it down.

285
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,317
<i>Always a pleasure, gentlemen.</i>

286
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,069
Get Press Lennox.

287
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,951
Ladies and gentlemen,
the embassy is secure.

288
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,398
The hostages are free.

289
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,430
Press Lennox.

290
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,112
Diplomatic security.
Provides embassy guards...

291
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,599
and protects against...

292
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,390
kidnapping and assassination...

293
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,790
and also, of course,
special services...

294
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,878
like the demonstration
we witnessed here today.

295
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,118
Excuse me, Mr. Lennox.
Somebody needs to see you right away.

296
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,593
My assistant will answer
any questions you might have.

297
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,313
Thank you all very much.

298
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,870
Ladies and gentlemen, are there
any questions I can answer?

299
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,313
Are you equipped with
night vision attack capabilities?

300
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,918
That was really, really great.

301
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,635
Well?

302
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,553
The answer is no.

303
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,076
Press, we got another
fucking alien on the loose.

304
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,229
Get somebody else.

305
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,388
Come on, buddy.
Your country calls.

306
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,272
Don't start waving the flag.

307
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,917
I'm in the private sector now.
I've got a business to run.

308
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,430
Look at me, Press.
You know how I got this goddamn eye.

309
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,714
It's a sacrifice I'd make
again in a heartbeat.

310
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,318
But then maybe you haven't learned
the meaning of sacrifice.

311
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,194
Listen, pal.

312
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,472
The last time I fought
with that alien she-bitch...

313
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,836
I almost got myself killed.

314
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,312
If the government was stupid
enough to make another one...

315
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,350
I think they can clean up
the mess by themselves.

316
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,470
We didn't make this one.

317
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,518
Count me out of
the search party, okay?

318
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,349
Where is my fucking key?

319
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,834
A million dollars, tax free.

320
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,515
Sure you won't reconsider?

321
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,511
Welcome to Biohazard Four.
Dr. Baker!

322
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,315
Come out here!

323
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,075
Oh, my God.

324
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,837
Open the doors!
Somebody open the doors!

325
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,112
Get him away from there!

326
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,113
Somebody open the doors!

327
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,359
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

328
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,308
You know there's no men allowed
in this lab. Get away!

329
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,670
- Calm down, Dr. Baker.
- Do you have respect for this?

330
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,952
- Out now, both of you!
- We have an emergency.

331
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,718
Okay, we'll take it outside.

332
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,514
- Damn well right we'll take it outside.
- Don't blow a gasket.

333
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,199
Don't patronize me.

334
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,789
We're not patronizing.
We're coming along.

335
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,829
Close the doors.

336
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,550
Laura, correct me if I'm wrong.

337
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,751
Are you involved
in this crazy bullshit?

338
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,749
Dr. Baker runs this facility.
She cloned the Sil embryo.

339
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,039
Oh. Okay, well,
what should I call her?

340
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,391
Sil Lite?

341
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,839
- Her name is Eve.
- Eve. How very biblical.

342
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,712
We have dampened
her mating instinct.

343
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,593
We have strictly avoided the presence
of testosterone in this lab.

344
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,234
At least until now.
Thank you for your help in that area.

345
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,354
What if she gets
out of there?

346
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,879
She's electronically tethered
to a control box.

347
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,834
One step off the premises, and
a toxic capsule explodes in her brain.

348
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,116
You know, it's really great
to see you again...

349
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
and I was hoping we'd meet
under better circumstances...

350
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,472
but, I remember Laura Baker
having a little bit more soul.

351
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,230
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

352
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,477
You're coming into my lab,
questioning my motives!

353
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,556
Are you two finished?

354
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,480
We have a national fucking emergency
on our hands!

355
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,389
Now, you two
will work together.

356
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,670
That's a direct order
from the Pentagon.

357
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,475
You killed one of these fucking
alien things before. Do it again.

358
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,515
You heard the man.
Now the fun begins.

359
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,830
<i>I went over Orinsky's phone records,
and this is the last place he called.</i>

360
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,430
<i>There's a patient named
Herman Cromwell.</i>

361
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,600
Turns out he taught Orinsky
at Stanford.

362
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,759
And what exactly
is Cromwell doing here?

363
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,877
Well, that's
the interesting part.

364
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,198
It's classified
top-secret information.

365
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,075
I was doing research
on a Mars meteorite.

366
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,070
The one found
in the Antarctic in '96?

367
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,879
Fossils in the meteorite convinced us
there might have been life on Mars.

368
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,439
But these fossils weren't anything
organic to the planet. Oh, no.

369
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,638
And what was the basis
for that determination?

370
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,593
Carbon-based elements
in the fossils...

371
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,678
exist only
in the Magellanic galaxy.

372
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,715
That's 100 million
light years away.

373
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,714
Well, how did they get to Mars?

374
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,193
By my reckoning...

375
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,155
Mars was visited
by an alien species...

376
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,396
approximately
one billion years ago.

377
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,836
The species was like
a plague, a cancer.

378
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,159
It turned a thriving planet with...

379
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,956
rivers and oceans
and rudimentary plant life...

380
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,071
into a useless hunk of rock.

381
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,070
When I heard they were going
to send a mission to Mars...

382
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,396
I strongly urged the government
to reconsider.

383
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,434
On what grounds?

384
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,271
On grounds that alien DNA
might remain on the planet...

385
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,230
that any human attempt
to violate the planet...

386
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,273
would result
in biological contamination.

387
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,429
So, let me guess. They told you
to shove it up your ass.

388
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,916
They got me fired from Stanford.

389
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,318
It seems the military had strategic
reasons for wanting to go to Mars.

390
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,037
Outpost of the future,
or some crap like that.

391
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,240
Anyway, they harassed
the shit out of me.

392
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,992
I got into a fistfight
with a Pentagon general...

393
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,199
and broke his goddamn jaw.

394
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,191
That's why they stuck you
in here, right?

395
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,238
Why do you think that Dr. Orinsky
called you the night that he died?

396
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,717
To tell me I was right.

397
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,157
Whatever species destroyed Mars...

398
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,272
those poor astronauts
brought down to Earth.

399
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,268
May God have pity on our souls.

400
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,675
<i>I'll tell you one thing.
For General Lee...</i>

401
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,429
<i>to be eatin' up the road
this early in the mornin'...</i>

402
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,559
<i>something's sure got
Bo and Luke all head up.</i>

403
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,955
<i>I figure it's got somethin'
to do with women.</i>

404
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,030
<i>Or huntin'.
Or maybe wheels.</i>

405
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,559
The temperature on Mars
is approximately 225 degrees below zero.

406
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,910
If they brought the samples on board,
the temperature thaw...

407
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,634
could have brought the DNA
back to life.

408
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,468
That DNA could have infected
the astronauts.

409
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,672
This isn't the fucking X Files,
goddamn it!

410
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,394
You are following a lead
based on the interrogation...

411
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,352
of a certified nutcase.

412
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,714
We got one dead N.S.E.G. doctor...

413
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,948
we have a guy who warned
the government not to go to Mars...

414
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,991
they slapped him in a loony bin...

415
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,150
and a seven-minute time gap
during the space flight.

416
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,756
We need to do blood analysis
on Sampas, Gamble and Ross.

417
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,072
Now, I know that there is
a sexual quarantine of ten days...

418
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,159
on all interplanetary missions,
and the Mars quarantine ends tonight.

419
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,636
They could fuck the human race
into extinction.

420
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,268
You want to be responsible for that
if we don't start testing everybody now?

421
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,314
Test Patrick first.

422
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,757
Yeah.

423
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,954
I've been waiting
to get you alone.

424
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,711
All the interviews,
all the screaming girls...

425
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,639
all the hoopla...

426
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,790
gone.

427
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,671
Push it out of your mind.

428
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,393
Patrick Ross...

429
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,669
tonight...

430
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,069
you're mine.

431
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,788
I love you.

432
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,799
What's the matter?

433
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,634
I don't know.
We should hold off.

434
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,195
Oh, no. No, you don't.
Not tonight.

435
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,391
Come on, Missy.
I don't feel so good.

436
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,429
Relax.

437
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,078
Let me do the work.

438
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,554
There's nobody here.

439
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,398
Where the fuck did he go?

440
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,678
Let's go find the others.

441
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,992
I missed you up there.

442
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,718
I missed you so much.

443
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,712
It's so beautiful.

444
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,437
Not as beautiful as you are.

445
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,594
Charmer.

446
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,633
Take it easy, Press.
You're gonna get us killed.

447
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,229
Trust me, Laura.
I got a bad feeling in my stomach.

448
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,716
God, I missed making love
with you.

449
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,470
Oh, my stomach!

450
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,113
- Oh, my God!
- Call someone!

451
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,992
Call for help!

452
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,715
Up here. Come on!

453
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,114
No, please!

454
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,631
Oh, God.

455
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,393
I'm gonna get a full crew.

456
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,153
I'm gonna get 'em over here
right away.

457
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,552
We gotta get to the others.

458
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,518
Oh, this is awful.

459
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,355
This is just awful.

460
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,549
I'll take her the rest of the way.

461
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,909
Have a good evening.

462
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,559
This is nice.

463
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,432
You thought I lived on a tugboat.

464
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,632
I know what you thought.
But I got it all under control now.

465
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,636
Oh, you do?

466
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,559
Yeah, you just slide
right over there.

467
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,159
Let me open this door.

468
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,590
There we go.
Hey, girl.

469
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,992
- Is that it?
- No, honey, that's not it.

470
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,394
Right there.

471
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,828
No, that's not it.

472
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,628
Oh, that's it.

473
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,869
What's wrong?

474
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,388
Dennis Gamble, we'd like you
to come with us.

475
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,638
Man, a brother just can't get no booty.
You know what I'm sayin'?

476
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,357
This is no way to treat a national hero.
This is embarrassing.

477
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,069
What is this all about?
Look, somebody speak to me.

478
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,799
Hey, I'm a personal friend
of Senator Judson Ross, okay?

479
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,833
Personal friend. I'm gonna eat
your badge for breakfast.

480
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,712
Get your hand
off my head, man.

481
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,956
I demand an explanation.

482
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,791
We'll have the test results
in a few minutes.

483
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,992
Why am I being tested?
N.S.E.G. said I was fine.

484
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,509
Sit tight, son.
We'll explain everything later.

485
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,995
Well, it's kind of tough
to sit tight, sir.

486
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,633
I haven't been laid in 11 months.

487
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,109
That's unusual for me.

488
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,118
Take it easy, Burgess.
Everybody deserves an explanation.

489
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,389
You're damn right.

490
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,831
And what's with all these guards?
What the hell is going on around here?

491
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,198
It's purely
a precautionary measure.

492
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,350
We need a couple of minutes
for the blood analysis, so just relax.

493
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,632
Couple of questions.

494
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,879
What can you tell us about the seven
minutes when the Excursion lost contact?

495
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,796
I can't remember.

496
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,358
I don't know if I blacked out,
I can't remember.

497
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,399
When did you last speak
to Anne Sampas?

498
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,998
At that fund-raiser
the other night.

499
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,076
Did she act peculiar?

500
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,789
She seemed fine to me.

501
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,196
What's this all about?
Something happen to her?

502
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,469
You tell me.

503
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,319
What happened to Anne Sampas?

504
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,319
Tell me what happened to her!

505
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,388
Anne Sampas is dead.

506
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,959
I'm sorry, Dennis.

507
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,156
Yeah. Laura.

508
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,590
Well, the combinant DNA in Anne's body
doesn't match what I found in Orinsky's.

509
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,515
So, it's either Gamble or Ross.

510
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,354
Be careful, Press.

511
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,838
What was the cause of death?

512
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,109
We don't know.

513
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,639
Come on.
How the hell did she die?

514
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,398
Sequence almost complete.

515
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,955
- Why are you testing my blood?
- Ten seconds till relay.

516
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,515
- You think I killed Annie?
- Data retrieval on-line.

517
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,153
- Is that what you think?
- Five seconds. Three seconds.

518
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,999
I didn't kill her! I swear!

519
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,594
Computer says normal.
There is no sign of infection.

520
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,270
- Go home, get some rest.
- Look, I want answers!

521
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,914
In due time.
We'll be in touch.

522
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,117
Yo, Gamble.

523
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,913
You know where Patrick Ross is?

524
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,196
Nope.

525
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,549
Well, if you see him,
you'll let me know, yeah?

526
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,196
Sure.

527
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,795
Well, let's see what
the cranial cavity has to say.

528
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,990
Now I'll just reach
behind her ear, and we should...

529
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,236
God.

530
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,516
Patrick, no!

531
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,234
Want a date, mister?

532
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,310
I was scared, man.

533
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,431
This is crazy.

534
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,759
His whole head just grew right back
like some sort of damn freak show.

535
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,550
The alien species
can regenerate living tissue.

536
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,559
Aliens, little green men.

537
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,308
I still can't believe it.

538
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,988
If they knew there were aliens
up there, why did they send us?

539
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,998
N.S.E.G. got warned
but they chose to ignore it.

540
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,794
We think that there was some hostile DNA
in the soil samples that you collected.

541
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,239
Something happened up there.

542
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,269
I can't remember exactly.

543
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,919
I just know it was terrible.

544
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,076
I'm sure that it was terrible.

545
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,953
The question is:
How do we proceed now?

546
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,637
I got guys out there all over the place
looking for this kid.

547
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,673
Any place he might be.
We're gonna find him sooner or later.

548
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,754
If he's reproducing,
we've got potential offspring.

549
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,796
I think it's safe to assume he's banging
cocktail waitresses two at a time.

550
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,314
Well, then in less than two weeks,
these offspring reach adolescence...

551
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,158
and then they enter
the chrysalis stage.

552
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,356
Chrysalis stage?

553
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,918
A cocoon which
turns them into adults.

554
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,994
Hey, baby,
turn that car around.

555
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,959
Hey, don't leave me.
Come on.

556
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,633
Hi, honey.

557
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,670
Baby, come back.

558
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,033
<i>A serial killer may be loose
in the Washington-Maryland area.</i>

559
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,073
<i>Authorities have asked the public
to be extremely cautious...</i>

560
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,396
<i>when approached by strangers.</i>

561
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,874
How much for number three?

562
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,717
Twenty an hour.

563
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,753
<i>Thank you, Linda.
And now for the financial news.</i>

564
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,599
Twenty, forty, sixty.

565
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,995
Thank you much.

566
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,949
Enjoy yourself.

567
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,190
Come in.

568
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,553
See what I mean, Laura?
Every so often, her rates go berserk.

569
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,439
Fifty agents we got out there
looking for this guy.

570
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,474
We got nothing.

571
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,151
Man, how can you
just touch that?

572
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,238
Occupational hazard.

573
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,150
So, you didn't see nothing,
didn't hear nothing, don't know nothing?

574
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,191
They come and they go.
You know what I mean?

575
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,789
They come and they go.

576
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,996
Oh, that's hysterical.
Sit your ass down.

577
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,997
They come, they go.
You get it?

578
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,037
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Here you go.

579
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:42,990
Thanks.

580
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,913
We're wasting time.

581
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,588
It's been two days,
and Lennox hasn't made any headway.

582
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,997
Maybe that's because you gentlemen
won't allow us to go public.

583
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,155
Dr. Baker,

584
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,920
you said that Eve
has telepathic abilities.

585
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,950
Some.

586
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,479
Can we send her after Patrick?

587
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,035
It'd be foolish to take her
out of a controlled atmosphere.

588
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,389
There's the danger of escape.

589
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,398
Then we'd have two aliens loose,
instead of one.

590
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,672
If these two were to mate, the resulting
pure strain of offspring...

591
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,677
would be unstoppable.

592
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,429
Well, can she tell us where he is
without leaving the lab?

593
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,990
We've seen spiking
in her biorhythms...

594
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,350
which indicate
a rudimentary connection...

595
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,790
but half her alien genes
are dormant.

596
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,233
Tracking Patrick
is out of her league.

597
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,631
Dormant means asleep.

598
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,119
Is there any way
that we can wake them up?

599
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,751
We could use the lab's
cyclotron...

600
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,872
to bombard her with radiation
that would awaken her dormant genes.

601
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,433
But there is a problem.

602
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,436
What's that?

603
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,153
We make her more alien.

604
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,237
We increase her strength,
her anger.

605
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,431
Her mating drive
would go through the roof.

606
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,433
It's worth the risk.
We'll tighten security.

607
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,993
She is not a lab animal.

608
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,993
She is half-human.

609
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,919
Please, Baker, spare us
the alien rights agenda.

610
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,189
Put her in the cyclotron.

611
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,589
And what if I refuse?

612
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,430
That's your prerogative.
She's gonna go in anyway.

613
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,152
Gentlemen.

614
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,998
Don't worry, Laura.

615
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,553
I know what they want.

616
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,072
I'm sorry. This is not what I intended.
It's gonna be very painful for you.

617
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,034
I want to help.

618
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,112
I'm going to radiate for 45 seconds
then shut it down.

619
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,278
I'm connected, Laura.

620
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,158
I see what he sees.

621
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,029
<i>He's driving down a small street.</i>

622
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,468
<i>I see two-story buildings...</i>

623
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,592
<i>a man walking a small dog.</i>

624
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,429
They're stopping at a stoplight.

625
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,313
Okay, here we go!

626
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,552
<i>I see street signs.</i>

627
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,548
Gwynn's Falls and Warwick!

628
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,356
- Intersection of Gwynn's Falls...
- He's in a parking lot!

629
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,518
<i>- What?
- Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.</i>

630
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,709
Gwynn's Falls?

631
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,670
Where?

632
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,154
That's in Reservoir Hill!

633
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,918
There's a big supermarket!

634
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,556
He's going into the supermarket
near Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.

635
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,679
Hang on to your shorts!

636
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,311
- He's going after a woman!
- Let's go!

637
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,150
How the hell did you get
a drivers' license?

638
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,674
Where is he?

639
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,515
Aisle one. Fruits and vegetables!

640
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,392
He's in aisle one,
fruits and vegetables.

641
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,434
We're there. Now what?

642
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,109
Come on, Press!

643
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,550
My God! It's you!

644
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,952
- Will you sign my Space Flakes box?
- Sure.

645
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,470
You got a pen?

646
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,194
I do.

647
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,111
What's your name?

648
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,597
Darlene.

649
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,110
"Darlene."

650
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,034
You know a secret?

651
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,756
I think Space Flakes taste like shit.

652
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,672
- Which row?
- Cereal!

653
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,879
Come on, Press.

654
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,275
Watch it!

655
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,433
Where's the goddamn cereal?

656
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,231
Nice to meet you.

657
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,589
Really nice to meet you.

658
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,272
It's her!

659
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,311
Help me!

660
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,589
Which way?

661
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,874
Quick! Which way?

662
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:12,796
What she say?

663
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,438
They're going down some stairs.

664
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,756
A basement! Find a basement!

665
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,115
<i>It's dark.</i>

666
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,749
He wants to mate with her!

667
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,269
Get away!

668
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,350
Get up!

669
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,196
Shut up!

670
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,349
Help!

671
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,951
Get down!

672
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,754
- Damn it!
- No!

673
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,635
Help!

674
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,995
He's trying to rape her!

675
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,478
Man, don't shoot!

676
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,875
Why don't you get a motel?

677
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,949
Fuckin' kids.

678
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,474
He knows I'm tapping in.

679
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,478
Help! Leave me alone!
Stop!

680
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,519
Get off me!

681
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,432
Eve...

682
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,191
Patrick!

683
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,035
Go on! Get out of here!

684
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,995
Get out!

685
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,511
- Don't move, spaceman.
- Put down the gun.

686
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,556
Get your hands up!

687
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,195
Get 'em up!

688
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,395
What is this?

689
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,958
You can't deny some bugged-out stuff
going on around here.

690
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,630
What kind of stuff?

691
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,470
You told me yourself
you were feeling weird.

692
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,070
You gotta go in for tests, bro.

693
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,680
Sure. I don't mind
going into the lab.

694
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:34,631
Open the gate.

695
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,594
What's going on?

696
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,598
Estrogen level's peaking.
It's like she's in heat.

697
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,315
Let me out!

698
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,950
Let me out!

699
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,475
Let's go.

700
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,793
Has she been given
any medication?

701
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,115
Yes, her usual dose.

702
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,355
Let me out, Laura!

703
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,788
I'm going to double it.

704
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,910
Let me out!

705
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,475
Listen to me, Laura...

706
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,277
Laura!

707
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,992
Code 459 alert. Patrick Ross
in Biohazard Four. Seal the compound!

708
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,878
Get out of there, Sherry!

709
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,230
Patrick, leave her alone!

710
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,350
Open the door.

711
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,511
I know what you're going through,
and I can help you.

712
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,040
- Let me help you.
- Open the goddamn door.

713
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,836
I can't do that.

714
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:24,912
I'm sorry.

715
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,599
- Open it!
- I can't...

716
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,708
Get away from her now!

717
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,754
The proof is incontrovertible.

718
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,754
Your son was infected
up in that capsule.

719
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,758
I'm sorry, Senator.

720
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,679
Jesus God.

721
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,069
Rest assured
we'll deal with this quietly.

722
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,669
Medical treatment, the best doctors.

723
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,199
The last thing this country needs

724
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,312
is a spectacle with a national hero
being publicly compromised.

725
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,438
Cut the crap, Carter.

726
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,359
What the hell are we gonna do?

727
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,988
Two imperatives:

728
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,112
We have to find Patrick
and bring him in immediately.

729
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,518
We have to neutralize any possibility
that this could leak to the media.

730
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,995
The generals are very concerned.

731
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,120
They're gonna kill him, aren't they?

732
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,715
We need to find your son.

733
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,433
You listen to me,
you arrogant son-of-a-bitch.

734
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,552
If you touch a hair on his head...

735
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,792
you will rue the day you were born!

736
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,750
You make it very hard
to help you, Senator.

737
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,678
Go fuck yourself!

738
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,118
What the hell did you think I'd do?
Stand here and let you take my son?

739
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,669
I'll call the goddamn President
if I have to.

740
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,949
Listen carefully, old man.

741
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,080
This is way beyond the President.
Way beyond.

742
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,353
You wanna save Patrick?

743
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,838
Help us bring him in.

744
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,957
Damn, man! What is up?
I can't even get no play from an alien.

745
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,956
Some people carry a disease
in their genetic code.

746
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,628
The possibility exists it might be
passed on to their children.

747
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,794
Those N.S.E.G. doctors
told me I had sickle trait.

748
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,631
It's in your chart.
You don't have sickle-cell anemia,

749
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,354
which is why you were able
to go to Mars. But you're a carrier.

750
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:13,797
Right.

751
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,796
Well, I guess that's why
he didn't get infected up on the ship.

752
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,117
Right. Alien DNA cannot cope
with human genetic flaws.

753
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,993
It has no defense against our diseases,
and that might be our answer.

754
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,633
What could be the answer?

755
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,717
Alien DNA infected us.
It's about time we infected them.

756
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,110
What?

757
01:04:59,320 --> 01:04:59,877
Patrick...

758
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,954
Dad, what are you doing here?

759
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,315
I kind of figured
you'd show up here.

760
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,638
You always used to love this place
as a child.

761
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,954
So did your mother.

762
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,549
I never could convince her
to get rid of it.

763
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,715
Yeah, I used to come here
when I was courting her.

764
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,951
- And after she died...
- What do you want?

765
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,230
Well...

766
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,469
First off, I'd like to apologize.

767
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,549
Apologize for what?

768
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,676
Oh, Paddy.

769
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,556
Don't bother.

770
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,878
They told me what happened...

771
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,994
how you got infected up on Mars.

772
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,793
I'm sorry, Paddy... for not listening
when you asked for help.

773
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,469
You never listened.

774
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,399
I'm listening now.

775
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,708
They're gonna kill me.

776
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,197
Not if I can help it.

777
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,350
Now, there's no way
that they can find you here.

778
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,596
This property's still listed
under you mother's maiden name.

779
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,039
And I sure as hell am not gonna hand
you over to those Pentagon bastards.

780
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,190
No, sir.

781
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,791
I'm taking you in to Johns Hopkins...
for treatment with the best.

782
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,919
We'll walk through that door together.

783
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,309
Come in with me, son.

784
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,270
No.

785
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,397
I know you won't do it for me.

786
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,276
But try to think of your mother.

787
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,679
Do it for her.

788
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,434
Dad, help me.

789
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,429
It's okay.

790
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,629
It's okay.

791
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,516
Eve...

792
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,474
We need your help again
to find Patrick.

793
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,832
I'm sorry, Laura.
I can't do that.

794
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,588
We could just call in
the National Guard.

795
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,595
Sorry, pal.
This is strictly a private mission.

796
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,552
Yeah, well, I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.

797
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,109
You haven't been one of those

798
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,029
in 11 months.

799
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,713
Why you gotta bring that up?

800
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,515
Okay, I was a lover. I sure as hell
ain't no damned bounty hunter.

801
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,718
This looks about right.

802
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,157
What?
That little, old tiny ass thing?

803
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,632
You ain't got
no bazookas up in here?

804
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,115
Bazookas?

805
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,716
Hasn't anyone ever told you
that size doesn't matter?

806
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,790
I mean, you can talk all that noise
if you want to.

807
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,151
I'm taking this because I'm about
to go back to Africa on somebody's ass.

808
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,113
I've used Dennis' blood sample
as the basis for this toxin.

809
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,989
Of course, I have no idea
whether or not this is going to work.

810
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,157
It's an interesting idea.
It might be the only chance we got.

811
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,952
But what if it doesn't work?

812
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,273
Well, then, my friend,

813
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:00,870
we're fucked.

814
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,636
Get the tether!

815
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,716
<i>Containment breach.</i>

816
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,195
We're locked in here!

817
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,595
<i>Electronic tether,
armed for activation</i>

818
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,075
<i>in five, four...</i>

819
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,995
<i>three, two, one.</i>

820
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,716
It's stuck.

821
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,111
Get back!

822
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,792
<i>Security breach, code red,
level four.</i>

823
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,838
Colonel, there's a lot
of activity below.

824
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,235
Keep your distance.
Let's see what's going on.

825
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,511
Fire!

826
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,030
Come on.

827
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,797
Get in the humvees! Let's go! Now!

828
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,673
You heard him! Go!

829
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,391
How in the hell
does she know how to drive?

830
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,795
<i>Her favorite show's
The Dukes of Hazard.</i>

831
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,797
Fan-fuckin'-tastic.

832
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,714
<i>Burgess, this is General Metzger.</i>

833
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,151
<i>Maintain your pursuit
but do not engage alien escapee.</i>

834
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,238
<i>Let Press Lennox do his job.
Is that clear?</i>

835
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,829
Roger. Back off, Captain.

836
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,271
I don't wanna crash this party
until just the right time.

837
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,789
Stop right here.

838
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,632
Grab that spray canister.

839
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,353
Be careful with that thing.

840
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,511
Jesus Christ!

841
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,270
Welcome to the maternity ward...

842
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,629
from hell.

843
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,910
Patrick's offspring.

844
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,670
I'm gonna go up and see if I can find
Adam and Eve.

845
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,472
Press, this isn't Eve's fault.
She's human too.

846
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,070
Like them.

847
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,720
What's wrong?
My DNA ain't good enough?

848
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,033
You let me live on that ship
so I can die in this goddamn barn?

849
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,318
Fuck you!
Fuck all you pig motherfuckers!

850
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,995
I'm about to get straight
Kunta Kinte on your ass!

851
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,875
Dennis!

852
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:12,751
It's working!

853
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,071
Score one for human DNA, baby!

854
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,516
Why don't you get those?
I'm going up here.

855
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,199
Just do your thing, baby.

856
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,551
Die!

857
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,355
Thank you.

858
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:07,996
You're welcome.

859
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,390
Eve, get out of the way!

860
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,038
What the hell is going on in here?

861
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,275
Stay back!

862
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,949
Oh, my God!

863
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,356
Eve, I know you're in there!
Please help us!

864
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,755
Please, help us!

865
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:50,910
Press!

866
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,115
Get up! Quick!

867
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,277
Quick!

868
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,349
You killed her,

869
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,710
you disgusting son-of-a-bitch!

870
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,353
Press, use my blood! Quick!

871
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,910
Get up!

872
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,312
When did you start smoking?

873
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,555
Just now.

874
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,075
I wonder if I should have
this stuff analyzed.

875
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,838
Yeah, maybe you should.

876
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,793
You might turn into a sexual predator.

877
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,639
- Yeah, I guess that's possible.
- It'd be okay with me.

878
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,034
I have a drag?

879
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,028
- All right, one, two, three.
- Up!

880
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,516
- Easy.
- Got it.

881
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,512
Oh, now y'all show up...
after we do all the work.

882
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,199
I wanna talk to the general.

883
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,549
Know what I'm saying?

884
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,035
Mr. Gamble,

885
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,517
I need you to lie back for me.

886
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,190
- Yes, I'll be glad to.
- Nice and easy.

887
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,879
Looks like you're gonna be all right.

888
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,755
I'm fine, brother.

889
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,356
Be seeing you.

890
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,913
I hear you had a rough day.

891
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,916
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Well.

892
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,792
I've been killing aliens all night.

893
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,988
Know what I'm saying?

894
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,988
