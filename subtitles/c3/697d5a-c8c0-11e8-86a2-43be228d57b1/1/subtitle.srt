by running from an enemy.

369
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,843
Are you too weak to talk, Destroyer?

370
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,203
The Horde has no use for weakness.

371
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,888
Respect our tradition, Warchief.

372
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,208
You know the penalty.

373
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,242
Death!

374
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,044
ORCS: For the Horde!

375
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,805
For the Horde!

376
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,244
For the Horde!

377
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,521
For the Horde!

378
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,081
GUL'DAN: Stop!

379
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,685
You dare interrupt this judgment?

380
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,410
We fought hard.

381
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,124
Their warlock used your Fel against us.

382
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,806
Only I can control the Fel!

383
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,370
I see you and your men have survived.

384
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,205
Perhaps Blackhand kept you safely
away from the battlefield?

385
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,481
Maybe he knows you're weak, too.

386
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,607
Do you wish to challenge me,
little chieftain?

387
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,962
I do not question, Gul'Dan.

388
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,327
But the Fel is born of death.

389
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,444
It must have a price.

390
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,800
A price paid in lives taken.

391
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,524

Like his father.

395
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,564
A born leader.

396
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,048

00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,162
He challenges you already.

399
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,282
If Gul'Dan can infect
one as innocent as him,

400
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,967
what chance do the rest of us have?

401
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,210
Whatever happens.

402
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,290
Whatever happens.

403
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,170
I see you.

404
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,562
This gate, who showed it to Gul'Dan?

405
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,883
Who led him to Azeroth?

406
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,404
Gul'Dan called him a demon.

407
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,531
Did you see it?

408
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,011
Not the face, but the voice.

409
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,729
Like fire and ash.

(LATCH CLANGING)

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,721
Your mate.

416
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,448
I could kill you
before he even reaches me.

417
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,721
Lothar?

418
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,368
(CHUCKLES) He is my brother.

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,523
The king is my mate.

420
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,611
You're the chieftain's wife then.

421
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,851
I suppose so.

422
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,282
Then killing you would bring me
even greater honor.

423
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,891
Not among my kind.

424
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,731
It is a cold night.

One of them is the village of my birth.

430
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,924
I cannot imagine what horrors
you have been through, Garona.

431
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,042
But this doesn't need to happen.

432
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,211
We have had peace in these lands
for many years now.

433
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,930
Peace between races
from all over the world.

434
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,481
What is...

435
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,690
I can have it removed.

436
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,609
There is a life here for you, Garona.

437
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,441
With us.

438
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,725
A life of freedom.

439

Even from a distance.

450
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,642
Remember when we would track blood ox
through the Frostwind Dunes?

451
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,443
There was always meat, always life.

452
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,445
You don't think it's strange that we lost
our home when Gul'Dan came to power?

453
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,285
One orc cannot kill a world, Durotan.

454
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,930
Are you sure?

455
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,610
Look around you.

456
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,202
Does it not remind you of something?

457
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,161
Wherever Gul'Dan
works his magic, the land dies.

458
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,370
If our people are to make
a home here, my friend...

459
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,970
Gul'Dan must be stopped.

460
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,045
We are not powerful enough
to defeat Gul'Dan.

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,201
No.

462
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,321
No.

463
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,529
But with the humans' help, we could be.

464
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,850
I want that weapon.

465
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,610
You'll have me to protect you.

466
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,843
I need no one to protect me!

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,201
Respectfully, Commander,
my name is Khadgar.

470
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,086
My deepest apologies, Khadgar.

471
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,964
You see, I thought we bonded

472
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,046
when I didn't put you in a prison cell
for breaking into the Royal Barracks.

473
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,164
Now take the watch.

474
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,089
Well, at least you're not reading.

Beg your pardon?

477
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,241
You would be injured.

478
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,686
I don't want to lie with you.

479
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,446
Good. You would not be an effective mate.

00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,241
Why do you laugh?

482
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,722
I can't see how you humans
survive such a thing.

483
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,651
No muscles to protect you.

484
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,971
Brittle bones that break.

485
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,084
You don't look that different to us.

486
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,366
How did you survive?

487
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,004
Broken bones heal stronger.

488
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,725
Mine are very strong.

489
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,167
I'm sorry.

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,125
My name...

492
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,126
Garona.

493
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,449
It means "cursed" in Orc.

494
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,966
My mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me.

495
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,926
They kept you alive, though.

496
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,010
Gul'Dan did.

497
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,649
He gave me her tusk.

498
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,131
To remember her.

499
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,722
My parents gave me to the Kirin Tor
when I was six years old.

500
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,164
That's the last time I saw them.

501
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,522
Or any of my brothers and sisters.

502
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,288
It brings a family honor
to offer a child to the Kirin Tor.

503
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,964
To have their son taken up
to the floating city of Dalaran

504
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,089
and be trained by the most
powerful mages in the land.

505
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,687
Less so, to have them run away.

506
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,290
Well, that was cheerful.

507
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,920
GARONA: The Great Gate.

508
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,522
Why do they need so many prisoners?

509
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,044
Like wood for a fire.

510
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,042
Green magic takes life to open the gate.

511
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,168
LOTHAR: How many more orcs
are they planning on bringing?

512
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,241
GARONA: All of them.

513
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,729
This is just a warband.

514
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,403
When the portal is opened,
Gul'Dan will bring the Horde.

515
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,564
Get them back to Stormwind.

516
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,646
We'll ride ahead.

517
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,366
KHADGAR: Garona.

518
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,090
We should go. It's not safe...

519
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,160
Durotan.

520
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,081
To the north, there is a black rock
that touches the sky.

521
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,843
I would meet with their leader.

522
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,686
To challenge him?

523
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,970
I saw you lead the small-teeth
to our encampment.

524
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,448
They have seen what is being built.

525
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,286
But only you know what Gul'Dan
has planned for my people.

526
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,924
This magic is death, to all things.

527
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,530
Must be stopped.

528
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,800
Tell him.

529
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,283
The black rock, when the sun is highest.

530
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,961
GARONA: I will.

531
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,325
Chieftain.

532
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,243
If I return,
would you take me into your clan?

533
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,404
You're safer here.

534
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,126
With them.

535
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,328
(MUFFLED BREATHING)

536
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,882
Is it as you feared?

537
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,008
The Fel is everywhere.

538
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,408
Then you mustn't leave again.

539
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,126
They need a Guardian's help
now more than ever.

540
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,883
Maybe the boy can help.

541
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,006
We need solutions!

542
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,161
Easy for you to say that!

543
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,840
The Dwarven forges must work overtime.

544
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,207
KING MAGNI:
You treat us no better than dogs.

545
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,328
We shall supply you no more!

546
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,720
(SHOUTING) Enough!

547
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,729
You have all called on
Stormwind in the past.

548
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,604
Either for troops or arbitration.

549
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,365
If we do not unite to fight this enemy,

550
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,486
we will perish.

551
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,607
ALL: Hear, hear.

552
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,769
KING LLANE: Stormwind needs
soldiers, arms, horses.

553
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,049
KING MAGNI: We have our own
kingdoms to look after.

554
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,770
- DELEGATE: Fight your own wars!
- LOTHAR: Your Majesty.

555
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,366
Commander.

556
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,208
The orcs are building a portal,
through which they plan to bring an army.

557
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,404
If we do not stop them now,
we may never get another opportunity.

558
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,450
ELF DELEGATE: Where is he?

559
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,967
Where is the protector of Azeroth?

560
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,121
Where is the Guardian?

561
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,771
(SOFTLY) Where is Medivh?

562
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,687
My liege.

563
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,841
I suggest we take a recess.

564
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,325
LORDAERIAN DELEGATE:
Take as long as you like.

565
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,925
We're done.

568
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,565
What's left of the Fourth
has retreated from Stonewatch.

569
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,926
What's left?

570
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,405
Callan is among the injured.

571
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,441
Dad?

572
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,530
I'm fine. It's fine.

573
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,084
You had me worried.

574
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,123
Where's the rest of your troop?

575
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,362
They took most of them alive.

576
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,850
We'll get them back.

577
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,445
Don't be in such a hurry.

578
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,245
You're all I have.

579
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,680
I know.

580
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,288
I'm a soldier.

581
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,049
He would not ask for this meeting if he
thought he could defeat Gul'Dan alone.

582
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,324
The Fel must truly terrify him.

583
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,811
Durotan is scared of nothing.

584
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,769
LOTHAR: The location.

585
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,122
The suddenness of this meeting.

586
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,927
Sounds like a trap.

587
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,570
- It is not.
- Could be.

588
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,766
- It is not!
- Could be.

589
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,881
It is not!

590
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,486
What do you think?

591
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,163
It's too good an opportunity to ignore.

592
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,563
I think we have no choice.

593
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,645
We must stop the orcs
from opening the portal.

594
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,001
But we will need help.

595
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,047
And if he's lying?

596
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,201
Orcs do not lie.

597
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,441
What if he is?

598
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,449
- There is no honor in it.
- And where is the honor

599
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,324
in him betraying his own people?

600
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,808
Durotan is protecting his clan.

601
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,485
His enemy is the Fel.

602
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,165
Gul'Dan is the betrayer.

603
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,801
This orc, Durotan...

604
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,401
How do you know him?

605
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,561
GARONA: He freed me.

606
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,769
And he is loved by his clan.

607
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,250
He is a strong chieftain.

608
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,571
LADY TARIA:
Strong chiefs must earn their clan's trust.

609
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,486
If we are to expect you to join us,

610
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,204
we must earn yours.

611
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,086
To defend yourself.

612
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,771
With this?

613
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,729
Yes.

614
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,963
KING LLANE: Find the Guardian.

615
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,931
What is this?

616
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,240
Guardian?

617
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,131
The gate. We saw it, in the Morass.

618
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,726
I've been putting together
all the clues I can about it.

619
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,206
MEDIVH: This.

620
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,601
This drawing. Where did you copy it from?

621
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,727
Guardian.

622
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,801
And this.

623
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,685
And this.

624
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,565
And this?

625
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,208
I've been researching ever since
I felt the presence of the Fel.

626
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,851
I am the Guardian! Me.

627
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,089
Not you. Not yet.

628
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,720
I just thought you might
appreciate some help.

629
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,281
Don't presume you can help me.

630
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,407
You have no idea the forces

631
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,083
I contend with.

632
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,403
If you want to help,

633
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,481
protect the king.

634
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,283
You leave the Fel to me.

635
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,844
Interesting choice.

636
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,206
Guardian.

637
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,490
STORMWIND GUARD:
Pack up and move to the west gate!

638
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,931
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

639
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,769
You there! Rise from your stall
and get moving. Now!

640
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,646
I need your help. I found a book.

641
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,801
Of course you did.

642
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,085
There was an illustration that showed
a gate like the one we saw being built.

643
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,047
Sorry. Sorry.

644
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,247
Khadgar.

645
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,645
So then I tried to show the Guardian,
but he became furious.

646
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,211
Burned all my research.

647
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,881
He would've burned this, too,
if it hadn't been hidden in my robe.

648
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,809
No, turn the page. Here.

649
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,201
Look.

650
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,687
See?

651
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,924
What do you think the image means?

652
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,365
The orcs were summoned.

653
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,366
From this side of the gate.
They were invited in.

654
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,522
And the Guardian burned your research?

655
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,529
He's probably just trying to protect you.

656
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,245
Now go away.

657
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,521
A good spot for an ambush.

658
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,407
Our sentries are well placed.

659
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,611
I will check again.

I met a strong and noble people.

but it taught me something.

What is it?

880
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,721
An entity from a time
before the Kirin Tor existed.

881
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,004
We think it served a function similar
to that of the Guardian.

Protector.

883
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,811
No one beyond the Arch Council
knows of its existence.

884
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,644
And it will stay that way.

885
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,642
For you to mention it in
the same breath as the Dark Portal

886
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,211
is too much to be mere...

01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,211
Coincidence.

01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,601

You're Alodi?

01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,440
I used

895
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,361
the last of my energies
to summon you here.

896
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,528
The Guardian has betrayed us.

01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,400
Medivh.

898
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,200
I saw the Fel in his eyes.

He is consumed by it.

If he is not stopped,
this world will burn.

901
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,051
I don't have the power
to defeat a Guardian.

902
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,127
Guardian is but a name.

The true guardians of this world

904
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,647
are the people themselves.

905
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,684
I know you see what the Kirin Tor cannot.

906
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,609
It's why you left them.

907
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,882
No one

908
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,482
can stand against the darkness

909
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,931
alone.

910
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,490
I don't understand what you want me to do.

911
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,602
Yes, you do.

912
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,765
Trust in your friends.

913
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,330
Together

914
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,970
you can save this world.

01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,891
Always remember,

916
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,531
from light comes darkness

917
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,045
and from darkness...

918
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,085
Light.

919
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,601
Up, up.

920
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,406
Thank you, Moroes.

921
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,129
You'll recover, Guardian.

922
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,970
You always do.

923
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,920
No.

924
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,045
Thank you.

925
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,688
For everything you've done.

926
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,126
I'm sorry, old friend.

927
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,049
Seems that I have let
the orcs into this world.

928
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,809
The Fel, it has twisted me.

929
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,484
I don't even know what
else I may have done.

930
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,287
I just don't remember.

931
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,330
Everything I've thought
to protect, I have...

932
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,360
Destroyed.

933
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,882
I can't control the Fel.

934
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,051
No one can.

935
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,726
KING LLANE:
Five legions to block Deadwind Pass.

936
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,568
Another 10 here, here, and here,
along Redridge Mountains.

937
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,960
Supply lines here.

938
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,169
While the Eastern Sea hems them
in both south and east.

939
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,086
If we hold these positions,
we will be at our strongest.

940
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,321
Containment.

941
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,164
Until there is a better option, yes.

942
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,609
And when there's 10 times as many?
What then?

943
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,205
If there were easy answers...

944
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,170
Our priority must be to stop
the gate from opening.

945
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,484
Fail there, and it's just a matter of time
before they beat us with sheer numbers.

946
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,250
What do you suggest?

947
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,002
Send everything we've got.

948
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,765
Destroy the gate, free our people
and end the immediate threat.

949
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,206
And the orcs that remain?

950
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,441
We'll take care of them later.

951
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,648
After they've ravaged the entire kingdom.

952
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,247
My lords.

953
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,004
KING LLANE: Medivh, you are up and well.

954
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,525
I am.

955
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,931
I feel...

956
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,806
Restored.

957
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,121
KING LLANE: We need you.

958
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,044
We've been agonizing over our options.

959
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,282
Some of us believe there are no options.

960
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,805
- We need fresh eyes.
- I have news.

961
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,250
I met with Durotan.

962
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,925
You met with Durotan?

963
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,203
MEDIVH: The rebellion against
Gul'Dan is gaining strength.

964
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,362
With their help, we can destroy this gate.

965
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,851
That doesn't change my plan.

966
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,921
MEDIVH: What plan?

967
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,044
Anduin believes we should attack
with full force.

968
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,771
I'm concerned it leaves the rest
of the kingdom defenseless.

969
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,925
MEDIVH: How many legions
would you need to hold the orcs in place?

970
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,562
Five for Deadwind Pass.

971
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,166
10 for the Redridge Mountains,
10 more to protect the city.

972
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,488
We've already lost 18 legions.

973
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,961
That leaves one, two, three.

974
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,201
Can it be done, Medivh?

975
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,489
LOTHAR: No, it can't be done.

976
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,402
With three legions,
Frostwolves and my power...

977
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,324
With all due respect, Guardian your powers
have proven unreliable at best, recently.

978
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,401
Llane, have I ever let you down?

979
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,521
LOTHAR: Let him down?

980
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,842
Where have you even been
for the last six years?

981
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,161
Please, Anduin...

982
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,287
Medivh is the Guardian.

983
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,249
Not the one you remember.

984
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,160
He's lost!

985
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,321
He's unstable!

986
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,522
And he won't be there
when you really need him.

987
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,684
Find your bearings, Anduin.

988
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,606
I would march into Hell for you if I thought
there was the slightest chance of victory.

989
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,081
But there isn't. This is suicide.

990
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,241
Is this about Callan?

991
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,609
It was a tragedy.

992
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:35,766
If he hadn't been trying so hard to win your
approval he might still be with us today.

993
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,120
Medivh.

994
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,123
Callan wasn't ready, you knew it.

995
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,884
And you let him play soldier anyway.

996
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,371
Anduin, stop! No!

997
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,521
You killed him!

998
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,801
Just save it!

999
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,291
Commander, please, sir! Please!

1000
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,811
KING LLANE: Varis.

1001
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,522
Take him to a cell to calm down.

1002
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,688
You are no use to us like this.

1003
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,962
MEDIVH:
We'll protect the kingdom, my lord.

1004
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,051
You and I.

1005
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,801
(GATE OPENS)

1006
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,601
Why are you here?

1007
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,241
The King.

1008
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,165
He goes to fight the Horde.

1009
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,045
With your Guardian's help

1010
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,085
Durotan will kill Gul'Dan.

1011
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,440
Don't trust him.

1012
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,204
I have told you, orcs do not lie.

1013
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,686
Not Durotan.

1014
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,851
Don't trust Medivh.

1015
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,444
I will try to protect your king.

1016
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,085
Don't go with them.

1017
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,441
Why?

1018
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,243
I don't want you to get hurt.

1019
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,890
Come back alive.

1020
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,643
- MAN 1: Free us.
- WOMAN 1: We're thirsty!

1021
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,404
MAN 2: Spare us! Spare us!

1022
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,761
WOMAN 2: Please! We need your help!

1023
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,444
ORC GUARD: Hey! Frostwolf!

1024
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,004
Now, you're enemies with all sides.

1025
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,730
I'll tell them it was you.

1026
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,604
(GROANS)

1027
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,565
What happened?

1028
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,128
I'm sorry, Durotan.

1029
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,284
I did not see how we could side
with the humans,

1030
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,249
against our own kind.

1031
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,205
I was wrong.

1032
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,366
Gul'Dan's Fel magic is destroying us.

1033
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,284
- Where's Draka?
- Safe.

1034
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,365
But the rest...

1035
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,886
They wouldn't follow him if they
could see what he has become.

1036
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,369
Then I'll show them.

1037
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:15,009
There is no other man I would entrust
the safety of my family to, Varian.

1038
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,366
Keep them safe while I'm gone.

1039
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,126
Ready?

1040
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,720
I would feel better if Lothar
were riding with us.

1041
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,446
We'll be fine.

1042
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,681
I will return to Karazhan,
get ready for battle.

1043
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,360
Find me at the portal.

1044
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,770
KHADGAR: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1045
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,321
Psst.

1046
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,086
Guard!

1047
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,646
I know you're just doing your job.
And a good one at that.

1048
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,690
But I've cooled down now.

1049
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,766
So, if you'd just come
and open this gate...

1050
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,846
So I can protect the King.

1051
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,571
(YELLING) Open the gates!

1052
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:26,687
I am just following my...

(BLEATING)

1054
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,927
- Where the hell have you been?
- The Kirin Tor.

1055
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,491
It only works on the simple-minded.
Lasts about a minute.

1056
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,447
Your armor, Commander.

1057
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,127
- (BLEATING)
- Sorry.

1058
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,569
They have a full day ahead of us.

1059
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,281
I just hope we're not too late.

1060
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,441
We can't go after them.

1061
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,160
Not if you want to save Azeroth.

1062
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,368
- My King needs me!
- Azeroth needs you more!

1063
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,763
If you want to save your King,
we need to stop Medivh first.

1064

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

1065
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,361
(IN ENGLISH) Where is Medivh?

1066
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,364
We've got a demon to kill.

1067
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,007
ORC SCOUT: Can't be far.
Search over there.

1068
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,042
I need that baby.

1069
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,005
Check everywhere!

1070
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,285
Search on the road!

1071
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,562
Remember, you are the son
of Durotan and Draka,

1072
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,762
an unbroken line of chieftains.

I am Durotan.

01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,644
Son of Garad.

1078
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,048
Chieftain of the Frostwolf clan.

1079
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,643
And I am here to kill Gul'Dan.

A ghost cannot invoke mak'gora.

1081
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,481
You are the chieftain of no clan.

1082
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,609
Your people are food for worms.

1083
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,171
Some of us still live, Warchief.

1084

Shall I make a quick end of them?

1085
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,441
I always thought you were one
for tradition, Blackhand.

1086

Durotan.

1087
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,722
Your clan was weak and you are a traitor.

I accept your challenge

1089
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,090
if only to personally rip
the heart out of your pathetic body.

If you go to war with your own kind...

1302
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,011
If you do this, you will lose the Horde.

I pulled that from Llane's neck.

1314

Well, there has to be an explanation.

Yes.

I don't believe that.

1318

as well as we thought we did.

blessing a city can have

than a king

1321
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,486
who would sacrifice himself
for his people.

1322
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:10,931
But such a sacrifice must be earned.

1323
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,165
We must deserve it.

1324
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:18,490
If we only show our unity
to mourn a good man's death,

1325
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,122
was King Llane wrong to believe in you?
