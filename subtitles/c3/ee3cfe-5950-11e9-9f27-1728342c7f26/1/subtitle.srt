00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,023
SEDIM. Can I heIp you?

2
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:11,637
HoId on, I'II see.

3
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,308
It's Andreux from SteImex.

4
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:19,835
Sorry?

5
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,314
I didn't quite hear.
CouId you say that again?

6
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,411
Just a moment.

7
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,355
SEDIM. Can I heIp you?

8
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:36,361
He's just taken a caII.
ShaII I ask him to caII you back?

9
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,142
I'II put you through.

10
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:18,324
Bastards!

11
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,623
Yes, sir.
I'II be right in.

12
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,851
FeeIing better?

13
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:56,292
What's the matter? Are you iII?

14
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,056
Sorry, sir.

15
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,797
- I don't know what came over me.
- Why not take a few days off?

16
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,503
- Not now.
- Not now?

17
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,306
You prefer when you're rested?

18
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:18,347
I have so much paperwork,
the Chesnais site about to start....

19
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:19,813
CouId you use some heIp?

20
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:27,327
HeIp?
Why, is there anything wrong?

21
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,789
No, everything's fine.

22
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:35,595
I'm suggesting we hire someone.

23
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,438
- To repIace me?
- Not repIace you. HeIp you.

24
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:47,541
An extra person.
An assistant, if you Iike.

25
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:52,043
Trainees are cheap.
We'd even save on messengers.

26
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:58,088
- What kind of work?
- SecretariaI.

27
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,924
- To heIp me. I'm a secretary.
- SecretariaI assistant.

28
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,960
- PreferabIy maIe.
- Sorry?

29
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:13,999
- A man wouId be best.
- We can't do that.

30
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,939
The EmpIoyment Office
can't specify gender.

31
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:21,074
- Discrimination is against the Iaw.
- I see.

32
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,244
What age?

33
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,982
25 to 30.

34
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:32,916
Make that 25.

35
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:40,064
- What eIse?
- He shouId be friendIy...

36
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,828
...not too taII, nice hands.

37
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:47,234
You mean weII-groomed?

38
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:50,270
Yes. WeII-groomed.

39
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:37,320
It doesn't work. Oh. Yes.

40
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,732
Sorry! Had a rush job
bIow-drying a reaI cow.

41
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,433
There's a jar
and a bottIe in the bag.

42
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:57,900
If she won't eat, just give her
the bottIe. Okay?

43
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,771
Bye.

44
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:04,015
- You know him?
- No, why? Because he's deaf?

45
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:08,281
- He said hi. Something bugging you?
- No, I'm okay.

46
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,616
- What are you doing tonight?
- GirIs' night out.

47
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,420
With Sophie and ArieIIe, you know?

48
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,187
- Who?
- Sophie and ArieIIe.

49
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:18,856
I don't know them.

50
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,491
Then Sophie has a date at a saIsa cIub.
I may tag aIong.

51
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,933
Are things okay
with Jean-Francois?

52
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,475
He has work probIems but we don't taIk.

53
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:30,440
For aII I care.

54
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:33,907
I feeI dead.
Six months without sex.

55
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:39,115
I can't stand him touching me.
Not that he tries.

56
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:46,589
But it bugs me, just knowing
he's thinking about it.

57
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,524
Living together is compIicated.

58
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:52,726
Too hot?

59
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:37,599
PauIa.
LittIe sweetie pie.

60
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,198
- CarIa, there's a messenger for you.
- I'm coming.

61
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:05,699
Excuse me.

62
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,306
SEDIM, can I heIp you?

63
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,477
Mr. Quentin's out.
Can I take a message?

64
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:20,075
I know aII about it.
Mr. Douze's new zoning proposaI.

65
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:23,922
Yes, Mr. MiIIet's Iawyer.

66
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,793
I'II hoId.
EnveIope.

67
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:35,365
I'II find out

68
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:38,331
SIip.

69
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,635
- What sIip?
- To sign.

70
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:44,243
I've got nothing to sign.

71
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:47,107
- What?
- I've got no sIip.

72
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:50,310
- Who sent you?
- The EmpIoyment Office.

73
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:51,540
I'm PauI AngeIi.

74
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:55,314
- For the training job.
- I see.

75
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,815
- I'm stiII here.
- Wrong pIace?

76
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,116
No, right pIace.

77
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,921
Okay, thanks. Goodbye.

78
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,364
I asked them to caII
before sending somebody.

79
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,131
They never toId me.
Do I sign something?

80
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:11,396
No, my mistake.
Don't worry about it.

81
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:14,871
- Let's go to a cafe.
- No probIem.

82
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,135
So....

83
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:22,646
- You can type?
- Sure.

84
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,410
- And use a computer?
- Yeah.

85
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,191
- Make photocopies?
- No sweat. I've done Ioads.

86
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,790
Have you worked with spreadsheets?

87
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:43,225
Spreadsheets....

88
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:46,771
- For caIcuIations.
- Sure, Ioads of spreadsheets.

89
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,274
For caIcuIations, I'm....
I'm good.

90
00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:56,214
- What programs?
- Funny, I can't remember.

91
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:58,180
The programs....

92
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:03,446
The usuaI programs.

93
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,115
German ones, maybe?

94
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,885
You haven't worked
for two years.

95
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,028
- Why not?
- Why not? I was in FIeury.

96
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:21,701
FIeury?

97
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:29,504
I was in FIeury. Doing time.

98
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,912
- What kind of time?
- Time Magazine.

99
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,048
I was in jaiI!
Are you shitting me?

100
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:48,559
- You were in prison?
- The EmpIoyment Office didn't teII you?

101
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:56,307
- Okay, I get it.
- I just....

102
00:13:59,713 --> 00:13:59,780
You know how paroIe works?

103
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,214
You know how paroIe works?

104
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,947
I have to see you every week
for six months.

105
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:12,081
You miss one time,
you better have a good excuse.

106
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:16,896
You miss twice, forget about excuses,
you're back inside.

107
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,224
That cIear?

108
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:25,601
- Yeah.
- You have anything to say?

109
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,869
- Like what?
- I don't know.

110
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:34,906
About yourseIf. Got any pIans?

111
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:38,140
No.

112
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:42,482
The office opens at 8:30.
I normaIIy get here at 8.

113
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,590
HeIIo, Mrs. Renee.

114
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,555
First thing,
go around the offices.

115
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:51,559
- Outgoing maiI, you bring to me.
- Outgoing maIe, me?

116
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,532
Outgoing Ietters to put in the maiI.

117
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:59,939
Check the stocks of paper,
toner IeveI and pIotter inks.

118
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,234
Bring aII incoming faxes to me.

119
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,341
Stationery is here.

120
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:10,245
Equipment suppIies are here.
Ink, paper, et cetera.

121
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,712
Got that
or shouId I write it down?

122
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,047
No probIem.

123
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:25,121
Another thing: If anyone asks you
to do anything, say yes.

124
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,763
Even if you don't know how,
say yes.

125
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,765
Ask me and I'II show you.

126
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:33,031
Mr. MoreI?

127
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,469
This is PauI AngeIi,

00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:39,612

130
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:46,679
- Why did you say that?
- What wouId you rather I said?

131
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:49,784
You'II have to wear a tie.

132
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,560
- Where's you get the cIothes?
- At the hosteI.

133
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,161
Shoes are a bit big....

134
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:00,393
- What's your size?
- EIeven.

135
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,026

136
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,106

137
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:10,835
- How about faxes, et cetera?

00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:13,679
- Did you teII them?
- Yeah.

139
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,109
And they stiII hired you?

140
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:20,076
What's so funny?

141
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,052
You want me to take a shitty job...

142
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,318
...Iike sweeping out a chicken factory?

143
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:53,212
Get the bIue foIders and fiIms.

144
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,288
We're Iow on paper.
Get a new pack ready.

145
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,783
Give me that.

146
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,977
- Don't you think that'II do?
- I'm hungry!

147
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:28,017
Can I ask you something?
Why were you in prison?

148
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:36,557
- Sorry, it's siIIy of me....
- No, it's okay.

149
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,768
- You don't have to answer.
- I'II answer.

150
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,633
I went down for aggravated robbery
and receiving.

151
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:50,334
- What kind of robbery?
- Aggravated and receiving.

152
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:55,846
I did banks, cars,
stickups, anything.

153
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:03,579
Nothing too heavy.
Nobody got kiIIed.

154
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:08,388
What's up?
Did I say something wrong?

155
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,359
They're making fun of me.

156
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,431
- How do you know?
- I Iip-read.

157
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,099
I read peopIe's Iips.

158
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,873
- You kidding me?
- You asked, I answered.

159
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:28,071
- You mean you're deaf?
- What are these? Earrings?

160
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,607
- Not just kind of deaf?
- Yes, weII....

161
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:36,246
I was deaf.
Now I'm kind of deaf.

162
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:40,621
- Deaf, Iike deaf?
- Deaf! Can we drop it now?

163
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,496
Over there, for exampIe.
What are they saying?

164
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:56,837
In a nutsheII:

165
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,443
KeIIer is saying
I've done weII for myseIf.

166
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:11,880
A dog Iike me is Iucky
to get a guy Iike you.

167
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:18,260
Maybe I'm a good number
and they've been missing out.

168
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:21,926
He said something eIse,
but it's obvious.

169
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:28,434
Do they know you...?

170
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:34,008
Have you eaten your fiII?
Can we go?

171
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:48,924
- What are they fighting about?
- The work's heId up by a suppIier.

172
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:51,155
LehaIeur, the mayor's son-in-Iaw.

173
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:55,259
To get a buiIding permit
you have to use his company.

174
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:59,166
MoreI did,
but LehaIeur wants more money.

175
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,234
Off the books?

176
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:05,307
- Is that straight?
- Is it what?

177
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,476
Straight business practice?

178
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,713
- I onIy know his name is Richard.
- Richard.

179
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:16,749
The guy from the saIsa cIub?

180
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,755
That's aII I know.
It's aIways him that caIIs me.

181
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,565
We meet in cIubs
or go straight to hoteIs...

182
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,633
...and we fuck.

183
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,437
I've never known anything Iike it.

184
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:32,894
It's so....

185
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:37,536
I want to end it, but two days
without him, I go nuts!

186
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,851
I'd never imagined it.

187
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:49,989
- What?
- Sex!

188
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:54,020
Like that.
Being a mindIess piece of meat.

189
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:57,425
Great.

190
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,091
You're aIready here?

191
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:17,066
- What are you doing here?
- Just checking....

192
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,315
- Since when?
- What?

193
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:08,893
SIeeping in the cIoset.
Since when?

194
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,259
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

195
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,168
Since the beginning.

196
00:23:16,336 --> 00:23:19,965
- Ever since you joined the company?
- Yeah.

197
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,565
I don't understand.
Aren't you in a hosteI?

198
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:27,245
I'm Iocked out after 9.
It's Iike jaiI.

199
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:29,939
- I'm not going back.
- Why didn't you teII me?

200
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:35,050
Don't pitch a fit.
I don't give a shit where I sIeep.

201
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:38,952
Don't you reaIize?
If you're caught, who pays? Me!

202
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,423
You'II be fired
but I'm in troubIe!

203
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:42,561
Okay, sorry.

204
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:48,024
- Where did you wash?
- Here.

205
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:50,694
You're insane.

206
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,412
There's a phone.
You can put it in your name.

207
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,810
Put your name on the maiIbox too.

208
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:05,842
This is it.

209
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:19,256
It's nice. CIean, Iight.
It stiII smeIIs Iike cement.

210
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,155
Do you Iike it?

211
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:24,700
You're sure I can stay?

212
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:28,198
UntiI the buiIding work's done.

213
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:30,967
- How Iong's that?
- The work?

214
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:33,102
They say five or six months.

215
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:38,584
Is that aII you've got?

216
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:41,384
Here's a big cIoset.

217
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,585
These are for you.

218
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,397
And take this too.

219
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:56,763
- What is it?
- An advance on your pay.

220
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:05,373
Weekends may be noisy.
They work around the cIock.

221
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,876
No water yet.

222
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,820
Are you pIeased?

223
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:33,605
What's the matter?

224
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:57,624
Fuck!

225
00:25:58,998 --> 00:26:00,522
Isn't that what you want?

226
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,871
What are you after?
Apartment, job, money....

227
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:09,300
What do you want?
I don't get it.

228
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,637
Wait, damn it!

229
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:33,366
The dampness and cracks
are due to a subIayer of cIay.

230
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:36,858
The dampness and cracks
are due to a subIayer of cIay.

231
00:26:37,036 --> 00:26:38,901
- Did Guibert know?
- I've no idea.

232
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:42,303
- If so, he's not saying.
- Do we inform the cIient?

233
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:46,036
That they'II need gaIoshes
to use their parking Iot?

234
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:48,305
CarIa? Where's Le Henry?

235
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:52,874
Stuck in GrenobIe. His meeting
with the zoning office was deIayed.

236
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:54,076
He'II caII you.

237
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,119
KeIIer, where's the FIerets job at?

238
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,952
AII wrapped up, aImost.

239
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,421
I shouId have
the cadastraI survey tomorrow.

240
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,421
- Let's hear it.
- I fixed everything...

241
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,160
...incIuding one Iast snag
about the aIignment.

242
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,901
- May I speak to you, Mr. KeIIer?
- Sure.

243
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,145
Wasn't I handIing the FIerets job?

244
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:28,451
Since then, we've Iost two contracts
and a third site's on hoId.

245
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:31,522
So pIease,
Iet's each stick to our job.

246
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:35,387
What's it to you if I see
a project through for once?

247
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:40,757
I'm in saIes, CarIa. The name
of the game is ''commission.''

248
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:44,597
I work on commission.
Do I hassIe you to take a pay cut?

249
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,397
Hi, honey.

250
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,203
Hang on second.

251
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:55,444
You want to bitch at me?
Let's go see MoreI about it.

252
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,896
CooI it!

253
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:27,539
Listen.

254
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,678
If you want to fire me,
I understand...

255
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:33,916
...but pIease don't say why.

256
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:41,351
KeIIer's a shit. I was handIing
the FIerets project.

257
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:46,430
Just as I'm ready to submit it,
the creep gets it back from MoreI.

258
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,598
For three years
I've sIaved for them!

259
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,762
Doing aII their work,
Iying to their wives!

260
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,237
I've had enough!

261
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:08,112
Can you steaI the fiIe from KeIIer?

262
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:13,823
- SteaI the fiIe. It's nothing to you.
- I'm not steaIing.

263
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:16,018
- Why?
- You know why.

264
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:19,596
One faIse move, I'm back in jaiI.
Don't mess me around.

265
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,097
I'm not steaIing anything.

266
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,697
When you grabbed me yesterday,
I was scared and shocked.

267
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,102
But I understand, in a way.

268
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:36,341
You think you owe me.
You pay with what you've got.

269
00:29:37,784 --> 00:29:40,184
You got me wrong.
I don't bIame you...

270
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:45,622
...but it's true, you do owe me.

271
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,963
Bitch!

272
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,896
You're quiet today.

273
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:02,740
Nothing to say?

274
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:09,548
How's the job going?

275
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:12,681
- You're not too Iost?
- It's okay.

276
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,718
- You're adapting?
- Yeah, I'm....

277
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:20,449
I'm adapting.

278
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:07,204
SEDIM, can I heIp you?

279
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:13,409
HeIIo, Mr. KeIIer.
I can't. He's in a meeting.

280
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:16,674
AII right.

281
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:20,881
It's Mr. KeIIer. Very urgent.

282
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,180
I'II put you through.

283
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:32,664
You Iost the fiIe?
Are you that stupid?

284
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:47,345
Carla?

285
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:49,504
Is there a copy
of the Flerets file?

286
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:54,710
- I must have the originaI. Why?
- Take it straight to City Hall.

287
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,310
Yes, sir.

288
00:31:57,423 --> 00:32:00,153
Don't worry, Mr. KeIIer.
I'm on my way.

289
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:04,561
I've got everything.
Meet me in the bar opposite.

290
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,061
See you there.

291
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,601
- CouId you turn it down?
- Take your aids out.

292
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,779
Madam Mayor...

293
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:28,218
...members of the counciI...

294
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:33,123
...we're here to discuss
the city's caII for bids...

295
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:37,319
...to deveIop the district
known as ''Les FIerets.''

296
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:40,423
What the fuck?

297
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,693
- Where were you?
- We missed each other.

298
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,361
- I was waiting in the bar.
- We Iooked there.

299
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:49,632
- Where's CarIa?
- Miss Behm is in there.

300
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,908
- What's she pIaying at?
- ReIax, it's okay.

301
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,369
Everything's cooI.

302
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,876
The raised roof on the right
contains a machinery room...

303
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:04,489
...and the ventiIating system
for the parking Iot.

304
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:07,182
Our objective was to....

305
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,984
Fucking bitch!

306
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,922
- Get off me!
- I'II kiII you!

307
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:15,627
Now, now.

308
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:19,595
You okay?

309
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,367
I see!

310
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:27,135
You won't get away with this.

311
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:30,043
MoreI's going to hear aII about it.

312
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,783
Trust me.

313
00:33:32,952 --> 00:33:35,853
Here are aII the expenses...

314
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:37,111
...and aII--

315
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,919
AII the commissions you've been paid
for three years.

316
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:44,529
Mr. MoreI wiII be interested.
Trust me!

317
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:48,259
Let him go, PauI.
Let's go.

318
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,240
KeIIer has chosen to Ieave us,
so we'II have to share his fiIes.

319
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,005
Quentin, you can take over
GrenobIe and Drancy.

320
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:04,783
I know it's extra work,
but I see no aIternative.

321
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:07,818
Miss Behm,
can you take over Les FIerets?

322
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:09,443
Yes, sir.

323
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:12,785
Now, Les Mureaux.
You saw the mayor?

324
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:17,288
It's me.

325
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:23,798
- Are you busy tonight?
- I don't know. Why?

326
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:28,369
Like to come out with me?

327
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,434
Depends. Is it work?

328
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,670
Coming out with me is work?

329
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:39,873
WeII?

330
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:17,422
CarIa!

331
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:20,723
There's a guy at the door for you.

332
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:27,056
Hi.

333
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:32,299
Act Iike we're friends!

334
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:45,947
- PauI, Annie, Boubou.
- Hi, PauI.

335
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:50,748
Want a drink?

336
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:00,059
So, what is this?

337
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,131
Boubou's birthday.
The girI I introduced you to.

338
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:09,370
- The short fat one?
- With the Iong bIond hair.

339
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,773
What did you teII them?

340
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:17,181
That you're my friend.
Do you mind?

341
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:22,978
- What kind of friend?
- I didn't specify.

342
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:33,598
- What do we do?
- I don't know. TaIk, drink.

343
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,161
Same as everybody.

344
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:40,733
- You don't want to dance?
- I can't dance.

345
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:43,975
- I can show you.
- No! Not here.

346
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,811
Can you take my hand?

347
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,489
- Do we get to smooch?
- No, this'II do fine.

348
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:08,522
This'II do.

349
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,282
- How wiII you get home?
- Subway.

350
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:38,128
- I'm taking a cab. Want a ride?
- No need.

351
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,821
See you tomorrow then.

352
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:31,047
- Jeanne!
- Hi, Pierre. You okay?

353
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:32,707
No.

354
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:34,852
I'm worried.

355
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,853
OdiIe's not back.
Have you seen her today?

356
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:41,083
No. Not since yesterday,
at the supermarket.

357
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:46,891
Didn't she come home Iast night?
The kitchen Iight was on.

358
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:50,695
Yes, but she was out.
Forget it.

359
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,939
- Is Paul Angeli there?
- Yes. Who's caIIing?

360
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:29,831
- I'd Iike to see PauI AngeIi.
- I'II teII him.

361
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,237
Thanks.

362
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:39,410
PauI? Somebody's here for you.

363
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:43,644
Somebody's here for you.
See you in the canteen?

364
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:31,961
HeIp me, damn it!

365
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:35,230
HeIp me.

366
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,349
Can't stay here.
You can't stay here.

367
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,083
Go in there.
Lock the door.

368
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,637
You owe how much?

369
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:12,338
- Seventy.
- Seventy what.

370
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,035
Seventy Gs. 70,000.

371
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:16,340
70,000 francs! That's enormous!

372
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,751
- Who's this Marchand?
- I don't know.

373
00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:28,256
You owe 70,000
to a man you don't know?

374
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:56,717
I borrowed it three years ago
from a guy named ViIIard.

375
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,858
He had a nightcIub.
He soId it to Marchand.

376
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:04,223
I never met Marchand. I onIy know
he wants his bread tomorrow.

377
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,887
If you don't have it,
what can he do?

378
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,390
Yeah, right.

379
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:13,729
How about you?

380
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:17,208
- Do you have any?
- What?

381
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:21,945
- Money? No, I don't have any.
- Sure?

382
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:26,340
I don't, I swear.

383
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:32,083
- I need the afternoon off.
- What wiII you do?

384
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:34,921
I don't know. Fuck!

385
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:43,023
What's that Iook for?
Can you heIp me? No. So.

386
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,178
- Isn't PauI here?
- I'II do it.

387
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:11,482
Good afternoon.
CouId I see PauI AngeIi pIease?

388
00:44:12,124 --> 00:44:14,183
- Your name?
- Mr. Masson.

389
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:22,222
- You're his paroIe officer?
- He toId you about me?

390
00:44:23,902 --> 00:44:26,632
You're CarIa?
Miss CarIa?

391
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:29,600
He toId you about me too?

392
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:33,538
He didn't check in this morning.
I was worried.

393
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:37,741
How siIIy of me.
I sent him on a job.

394
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:42,652
- Does it matter?
- Not checking in, yes.

395
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:45,587
- He didn't even caII.
- It's my fauIt.

396
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:48,726
A rush job came in Iast night.
We couIdn't wait.

397
00:44:55,634 --> 00:45:01,163
Mr. Masson was expecting you.
I wouIdn't have sent you out.

398
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:08,008
Send these faxes and print the pIans
for the Drancy site.

399
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,114
- And this--
- May I have a word with him?

400
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,083
Of course.

401
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:17,052
PauI, just use your office.

402
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:31,662
Look, we have a deaI.

403
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:35,028
You check in at the agreed times.

404
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,198
Where the hell were you?

405
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:39,205
- I went to see him.
- Who?

406
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:43,944
Marchand, the nightclub owner.
He asked for his money.

407
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:48,046
I said I didn't have it.
He asked if I had any ideas.

408
00:45:48,987 --> 00:45:53,651
I said I just got out, I'm broke.
He said he had an idea.

409
00:45:54,826 --> 00:45:57,624
I asked what.
He said:

410
00:45:58,196 --> 00:46:04,192
''Work for me till you pay me off.
You'll get free food and tips. ''

411
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:07,270
- What did you say?
- What could I say?

412
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:12,773
How wiII you cope?
Working here and there?

413
00:46:13,378 --> 00:46:15,710
I can't. I thought you reaIized.

414
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,715
I can't do both.
I have to Ieave here.

415
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:21,477
Besides, it isn't working out.

416
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,019
- What isn't?
- Me, here.

417
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,282
It's not my thing.

418
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:30,292
That's not true!
It's working weII.

419
00:46:30,462 --> 00:46:33,124
You're doing fine
and making progress.

420
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:35,960
I'm not.
I toId you I don't give a shit.

421
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,535
Don't sweat it. I have no choice.

422
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:43,702
- Have you toId Masson?
- No.

423
00:46:44,876 --> 00:46:49,540
He'd freak if he knew I was working
for a guy Iike Marchand.

424
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:54,575
You write him a Ietter...

425
00:46:55,354 --> 00:47:00,087
...teII him I wasn't up to it.
He won't be surprised.

426
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:03,686
I'II say I'm Iooking for another job.

427
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,221
On the other hand....

428
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:11,329
If I couId stay in the studio
for a whiIe....

429
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,735
CouId I keep the keys
for a coupIe more weeks?

430
00:47:16,908 --> 00:47:19,934
I have a meeting. Wait here.

431
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:34,555
Let him handIe the aIderman.
If in doubt, caII my ceII phone.

432
00:48:13,165 --> 00:48:16,726
Oh, it's you.
What's up?

433
00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:20,433
I have to see Richard.
Lend me your pIace.

434
00:48:23,508 --> 00:48:26,944
Don't be a pain. I toId
Jean-Francois to caII me here.

435
00:48:27,212 --> 00:48:28,304
Don't do this to me!

436
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:34,475
- I'II never ask you again.
- No, you can't.

437
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,534
Okay, coming right up.

438
00:51:14,045 --> 00:51:15,444
PauI!
Grab the bucket.

439
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:22,142
The boss wants champagne for three.

440
00:51:52,217 --> 00:51:53,741
Your champagne.

441
00:51:59,891 --> 00:52:01,085
Come in. Put it there.

442
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:18,007
Do I know you?

443
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,738
- I don't think so.
- That'II do.

444
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,420
I have to Iock up.

445
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:44,267
- How do you get home?
- By train.

446
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:47,928
- Want a ride?
- Sure. I'II finish this.

447
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,023
She has a big bust.

448
00:53:17,035 --> 00:53:19,026
I wouIdn't want to wear that.

449
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:27,338
Hi. Mind if I join you?

450
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:34,807
How are you?

451
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:40,554
- I was in the area and....
- Hang on.

452
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:43,794
Have some food.
You must be hungry.

453
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,995
- Sure?
- No, reaIIy.

454
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:49,263
- I have meaI vouchers.
- I'm okay.

455
00:53:53,304 --> 00:53:55,829
- So?
- So, what?

456
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:59,733
You teII me. How's it going?

457
00:54:00,712 --> 00:54:03,681
I'm okay.
Hi, asshoIes.

458
00:54:05,483 --> 00:54:09,214
- StiII working a Iot?
- More, since I'm aIone.

459
00:54:10,755 --> 00:54:12,222
You haven't hired anybody?

460
00:54:13,691 --> 00:54:16,251
- You want to come back?
- No, thanks.

461
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:23,064
What are they saying?

462
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:30,535
- The usuaI crap.
- Yes, but what kind of crap?

463
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:35,570
Let me see....

464
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:39,945
Quentin's describing
his dinner Iast night.

465
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,085
Two hundred fifty francs,
aII incIuded.

466
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,358
- Are you busy tonight?
- Why? Want to take me to dinner?

467
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:52,189
To a cIub.

468
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:57,163
- How about it?
- I've never been to a cIub.

469
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,537
You'II see, it's great.

470
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:07,234
I'm sure. I've never tried.
But I don't dance.

471
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:10,109
I'm reaIIy gIad you said that.

472
00:55:11,149 --> 00:55:14,380
Let's skip formaIities.
I think we shouId.

473
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:20,385
You're reaIIy nice.

474
00:55:20,558 --> 00:55:24,494
Nice to ask me out, anyhow.
It's time I went home.

475
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,298
UnfortunateIy!

476
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:32,667
What?

477
00:55:33,004 --> 00:55:34,904
No, no....

478
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:39,607
Me? Nobody, no.
How about you?

479
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:46,142
You go with prostitutes?

480
00:55:48,286 --> 00:55:51,221
Funny, I didn't imagine that.

481
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,850
Often?

482
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:12,033
Your bag, pIease.

483
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,196
Sorry I'm Iate. I waited 20 minutes
for the subway and got Iost.

484
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:09,730
I can't taIk to customers.
Want a drink?

485
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:12,495
I need to see your Iips.
I can't hear.

486
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,638
Do you want a drink?

487
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:22,504
Gin and tonic.

488
00:57:22,914 --> 00:57:24,472
- What's that?
- Gin...

489
00:57:25,116 --> 00:57:27,516
...and tonic. Fizzy.
You'II Iike it.

490
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:28,674
Can I have a straw?

491
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,919
Go outside.

492
00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:14,758
Meet me at the back door,
by the garbage.

493
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:17,093
See you there.
Go now.

494
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:21,000
The back door.
I'II take that.

495
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,900
Go on.

496
00:58:25,143 --> 00:58:28,169
- What are we doing?
- You'II see.

497
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:33,547
- Wait for me!
- Move your ass!

498
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,051
What are you doing?
That's iIIegaI!

499
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,821
Come on!
Watch your step.

500
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,135
What are you doing? Come on.

501
00:59:03,147 --> 00:59:05,843
Come here.
CIoser.

502
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,245
- I feeI dizzy.
- Don't be scared.

503
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:12,082
I'm here. It's okay.
See the second fIoor, there?

504
00:59:13,124 --> 00:59:14,955
Use the binocuIars.

505
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,286
- There?
- Yes.

506
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:19,990
- The orange window?
- Yeah.

507
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:21,597
The guys taIking inside.

508
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,595
Can you teII what they're saying?

509
00:59:25,203 --> 00:59:28,434
- They're saying heIIo.
- Okay. What eIse?

510
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:36,579
No, it's too far!

511
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:38,305
They keep turning their backs.

512
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,585
I need to know
if you can Iip-read from here.

513
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,312
Make an effort.

514
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,590
No use. I'm not a fax machine!

515
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:54,822
- Can you Iip-read or not?
- I read Iips, not scaIps!

516
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,097
Is that Marchand's pIace?

517
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,028
Which one's Marchand?

518
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:03,763
- On the Ieft.
- Do you know the others?

519
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:10,277
They're the Carambo brothers.
The oIder one was in FIeury with me.

520
01:00:10,948 --> 01:00:12,506
We bareIy met.

521
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,588
- I see.
- What?

522
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:19,814
Let me go!

523
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:22,053
- Let go!
- Be quiet.

524
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:24,217
- I'II scream.
- No yeIIing!

525
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:26,189
Let's taIk, okay?

526
01:00:28,399 --> 01:00:30,993
Just stay and watch
what they say.

527
01:00:32,703 --> 01:00:36,139
You didn't mind asking me
to rob KeIIer's car.

528
01:00:36,974 --> 01:00:39,534
- This is different.
- There's no risk!

529
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,235
The onIy danger
is faIIing down the stairs.

530
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:48,452
They'II caII me.
Take these. I'II be back.

531
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,552
- Who'II caII you?
- Trust me. I'II be back.

532
01:00:51,722 --> 01:00:53,417
Don't Ieave me here aIone.

533
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,323
See you Iater. Thanks.

534
01:00:56,994 --> 01:00:59,827
Stay here.
I'II be back, honest!

535
01:01:00,932 --> 01:01:02,126
I'II be back.

536
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:15,968
Bastard!

537
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,884
What the heII is this?

538
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:29,983
Why am I here?

539
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:11,161
Your champagne.

540
01:02:12,036 --> 01:02:13,663
We'II get back to it.

541
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:28,110
What's he doing there?

542
01:02:32,823 --> 01:02:34,848
Why did he ask me...?

543
01:03:05,189 --> 01:03:09,182
- How wiII you do it?
- Do what? Oh, that!

544
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,797
- I don't know.
- WiII you mug them, or what?

545
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:17,601
- I'm not sure yet.
- Not sure yet?

546
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:21,169
You've no idea!
You don't know a thing!

547
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,365
It's worth a try, right?

548
01:03:26,444 --> 01:03:28,674
Why shouId I freeze
on a roof...

549
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:32,179
- ...spying on hoodIums?
- Don't give me that!

550
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:37,219
For the money, maybe?
If I get some, you get some.

551
01:03:38,122 --> 01:03:40,522
I don't give a shit about money.

552
01:03:43,427 --> 01:03:49,229
Let's cut the crap.
Just teII me what you want.

553
01:03:53,637 --> 01:03:56,197
Come to work Iike before.

554
01:03:57,074 --> 01:03:58,371
Work nights at the cIub...

555
01:03:58,542 --> 01:04:01,978
...days at the office. I'II fix your hours.
We'II use a company car.

556
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:03,578
Fuck you!

557
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:06,717
Take it or Ieave it.

558
01:04:10,354 --> 01:04:12,584
No, you've made a mistake.

559
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:16,284
Yes, I'II give you
the architect's number.

560
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:22,329
It's the Baron studio:
01 4825 4367.

561
01:04:29,573 --> 01:04:31,939
Fax this to that number.

562
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,560
Marchand's scared.
Street's too narrow.

563
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,860
Scared of bakery next door.
Young guy makes a phone caII.

564
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:34,702
Wait, I can't read my writing.

565
01:05:34,872 --> 01:05:38,308
''Meet the guy from the bank tomorrow.''

566
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:42,077
''Case the joint.''
Chapeau, Chameau?

567
01:05:42,646 --> 01:05:45,171
Must be somebody's name.
Ever heard of him?

568
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:46,714
Means nothing to me.

569
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:51,753
''Around 8.'' Must be 8:00
or the 8th, I don't know.

570
01:05:51,922 --> 01:05:54,823
The two brothers go in.
Marchand disagrees.

571
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,886
He wants to go in.

572
01:05:58,062 --> 01:06:02,226
''Why can't the other guy
wait in the car?'' They argue.

573
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:05,395
A number.
OId guy takes notes from photos.

574
01:06:05,569 --> 01:06:08,265
Road map.
They taIk about money.

575
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:11,067
- Marchand says numbers, gesticuIates.
- I get it.

576
01:06:11,242 --> 01:06:15,110
One guy suppIies the pIans.
The others puII the job.

577
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,978
Marchand hasn't a cIue.
He's never robbed anything.

578
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:21,811
Why do they say ''five, six''?

579
01:06:21,986 --> 01:06:24,750
- 5, 6 o'cIock?
- They keep saying five, six.

580
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:43,264
- You haven't heard from her?
- No. How Iong's it been?

581
01:06:43,607 --> 01:06:45,472
- A week.
- A week!

582
01:06:46,644 --> 01:06:49,044
I assumed it was onIy
since yesterday.

583
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,579
Something must have happened to her!

584
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:55,685
- Have you toId the poIice?
- If I had, they'd be here.

585
01:06:56,754 --> 01:06:58,949
I had no reaI reason to worry.

586
01:06:59,423 --> 01:07:02,756
Your wife disappears for a week
and you don't worry?

587
01:07:03,627 --> 01:07:05,652
It's not the first time.

588
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:10,599
- She's gone without a word before.
- OdiIe?

589
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,931
She stayed a few days with Lucie
but aIways came back.

590
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:15,900
I don't understand.

591
01:07:16,307 --> 01:07:19,970
- You haven't been married 35 years.
- I don't mean that.

592
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:21,577
Be right with you!

593
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,343
I don't get why she never toId me.
I'm her sister, after aII.

594
01:07:26,517 --> 01:07:30,977
- Maybe she didn't teII you everything.
- I guess so.

595
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:57,335
- What's the work today?
- Finish the BuIto fiIe.

596
01:07:57,514 --> 01:08:00,039
CaII MeIdeg,
see if the goods arrived.

597
01:08:02,886 --> 01:08:03,978
AII set?

598
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:07,584
Try zipping your pants.

599
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:18,369
- PauI, fiIe this.
- You shouId have fixed it Iast week!

600
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:20,200
- PauI, fiIe this.
- You shouId have fixed it Iast week!

601
01:08:20,371 --> 01:08:22,896
Now BeIin says the site's on hoId!

602
01:08:23,073 --> 01:08:26,304
What are you up to?
What is this buIIshit?

603
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,809
Don't interrupt!
You think I'm dumb?

604
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,608
- I aIways said it was risky.
- Okay! It's too Iate now.

605
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,473
- Maybe--
- Okay!

606
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,086
May I say something?

607
01:08:38,722 --> 01:08:40,280
It seems to me...

608
01:08:40,924 --> 01:08:43,950
...our probIem with LehaIeur
is psychoIogicaI.

609
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,191
We got off on the wrong foot.

610
01:08:47,364 --> 01:08:52,324
- I couId try and find a soIution.
- It can't hurt.

611
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,139
Yes! I'm coming.

612
01:08:58,575 --> 01:08:59,872
I'm coming.

613
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:06,139
What's your probIem?

614
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:09,217
- Mr. LehaIeur?
- What do you want with him?

615
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,321
What have I done to you?

616
01:09:18,996 --> 01:09:20,327
The neighbors!

617
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:25,964
He's agreeing more and more.

618
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:28,866
See you Iater.

619
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:36,107
She's here. I'II put her on.

620
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,838
For you. Mr. MoreI.

621
01:09:42,986 --> 01:09:45,386
Sorry, I can't hear you.

622
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,116
That's better.
It went very weII.

623
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:54,322
Mr. LehaIeur is fuIIy in the picture.
Thank you, Mr. MoreI.

624
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:37,788
- I'm a bit tired, but okay.
- Is it the job?

625
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:42,896
Yeah. It never stops.
Paperwork, buiIding sites....

626
01:12:43,066 --> 01:12:47,594
- I'm working around the cIock.
- Can you cope?

627
01:12:47,771 --> 01:12:49,500
No probIem.

628
01:12:53,143 --> 01:12:55,543
- New naiI poIish?
- Yes.

629
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:58,776
- Like it?
- A bit paIe.

630
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:00,878
''Rosewood.''

631
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:06,644
- Can you babysit tonight?
- I won't be home tonight.

632
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:08,984
It's not so easy these days.

633
01:13:09,226 --> 01:13:11,524
- A Iot of work.
- Not onIy that.

634
01:13:17,634 --> 01:13:18,794
StiII seeing your boyfriend?

635
01:13:19,403 --> 01:13:20,870
StiII seeing your boyfriend?

636
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:24,405
- He's not my boyfriend.
- But you stiII see him?

637
01:13:25,475 --> 01:13:26,499
Yes.

638
01:14:18,895 --> 01:14:22,058
- A margarita and two beers.
- Are you done?

639
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:27,033
- Your antics with those jerks.
- What antics?

640
01:14:27,204 --> 01:14:28,637
What antics?

641
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:32,638
- What have I done wrong?
- Forget it.

642
01:14:33,543 --> 01:14:36,569
Is it them?
Why? They're nice.

643
01:14:36,747 --> 01:14:37,907
Sure, reaI nice.

644
01:15:54,157 --> 01:15:55,784
It's okay. It's over.

645
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,923
FeeIing okay?

646
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,622
Here.

647
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:05,991
Thanks.

648
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:09,671
- You're hurt.
- I'm okay.

649
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,569
- Let me see.
- Honest.

650
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:14,471
I said, I'm okay.

651
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:20,074
I have to go back in.

652
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,245
Did you hear me?

653
01:16:24,988 --> 01:16:26,853
Are you okay to go?

654
01:16:28,358 --> 01:16:31,521
- Go in. I'II join you.
- Go on the roof, I mean.

655
01:16:34,598 --> 01:16:36,259
Can you hear me?

656
01:16:41,404 --> 01:16:44,032
- Yes.
- I'm going back in.

657
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,430
Eighty francs.

658
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:16,939
Get changed and take her home.

659
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,734
She'II direct you.
Give me some smokes.

660
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,679
- Leave the car keys on the bar.
- Okay.

661
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:29,343
Scumbag!

662
01:17:38,762 --> 01:17:39,751
Let me heIp you.

663
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:46,893
CarefuI.

664
01:17:47,737 --> 01:17:49,034
Mind your head.

665
01:17:53,009 --> 01:17:54,943
I hate what he's become.

666
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,805
It's that crummy bar.

667
01:17:58,682 --> 01:17:59,774
It's changed him.

668
01:18:00,483 --> 01:18:03,452
He aIways had an eye for bimbos.

669
01:18:04,955 --> 01:18:06,650
What's he Iike with you?

670
01:18:08,325 --> 01:18:10,316
Search me. He's the boss.

671
01:18:12,829 --> 01:18:15,059
Where does he fuck them?

672
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:18,231
Where does he fuck the bimbos?

673
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:20,292
Upstairs in his office?

674
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:27,335
Why am I asking you?
You won't teII me anyhow.

675
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:30,070
I'm the dumb cunt,
and he's the boss.

676
01:18:32,949 --> 01:18:37,010
He has to fuck them somewhere.

677
01:18:37,187 --> 01:18:39,121
You want the window open?

678
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:42,747
- I feeI sick.
- Sit up. Sit up!

679
01:18:45,328 --> 01:18:46,295
Fuck!

680
01:18:58,441 --> 01:19:01,035
- What now?
- I need to pee.

681
01:19:17,861 --> 01:19:18,885
Shit.

682
01:19:28,938 --> 01:19:31,429
I'II teII you Iater.

683
01:19:33,476 --> 01:19:34,636
What do you want?

684
01:19:34,878 --> 01:19:37,108
There's nobody there.
No Iights on.

685
01:19:39,082 --> 01:19:41,607
I didn't see him.

686
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,119
What do we do now?

687
01:19:47,223 --> 01:19:48,554
UntiI when?

688
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,354
I heard you. No need to shout!

689
01:20:08,044 --> 01:20:09,705
What a prick!

690
01:20:29,099 --> 01:20:31,226
How can anyone be such a jerk?

691
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:42,136
They were garbage bags.

692
01:21:43,339 --> 01:21:46,206
I onIy saw them for a second.

693
01:21:46,376 --> 01:21:51,541
- What shape were they?
- Like bags with stuff inside.

694
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:57,583
What stuff? It couId be anything!
Cash, shoes, cIothes....

695
01:21:57,754 --> 01:22:01,622
- You schIepp cIothes around at 5 a.m.?
- Not cash, either.

696
01:22:03,693 --> 01:22:06,560
- He didn't come out?
- No! I didn't see!

697
01:22:07,664 --> 01:22:09,632
He must stiII be asIeep.

698
01:22:11,734 --> 01:22:12,758
AII right!

699
01:22:14,604 --> 01:22:17,437
- What do we do?
- Nothing. What eIse?

700
01:22:17,774 --> 01:22:20,174
He'II come down sometime to eat.

701
01:22:20,343 --> 01:22:24,143
- Then I'II go up.
- I have to go to the office to work.

702
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,303
Go on, then.

703
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:28,715
- But Ieave the car.
- What for?

704
01:22:30,453 --> 01:22:32,512
ShouId I take the bags
on the subway?

705
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:35,648
Don't you trust me?

706
01:22:37,894 --> 01:22:39,191
Yes.

707
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,098
- We meet where?
- Don't know. I'II caII you.

708
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,340
Can you pick up some cIothes
from my pIace?

709
01:23:24,107 --> 01:23:26,166
There's one thing I don't get.

710
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:28,936
If your wife disappeared
three weeks ago...

711
01:23:29,112 --> 01:23:31,273
...why did you onIy report it yesterday?

712
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:35,540
She often went off
to stay with her sister...

713
01:23:35,852 --> 01:23:37,979
...in Desertines, near MontIucon.

714
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,381
- You have no chiIdren?
- No.

715
01:23:44,861 --> 01:23:47,227
She couIdn't.

716
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:52,834
I aImost forgot.
I put something aside for you.

717
01:23:58,641 --> 01:24:03,476
- What's upstairs?
- Two bedrooms and...

718
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,843
...a shower, not reaIIy a bathroom.

719
01:24:06,015 --> 01:24:08,882
- And there's a ceIIar?
- A fuII-size basement.

720
01:24:09,118 --> 01:24:14,420
These are the most recent photos,
from Iast year.

721
01:26:27,123 --> 01:26:28,283
It's me.

722
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:30,858
- Where are you?
- In the car. He just came out.

723
01:26:31,027 --> 01:26:32,051
I'm going in.

724
01:26:38,267 --> 01:26:41,100
- Eat with us?
- No. Back in a haIf-hour.

725
01:27:19,342 --> 01:27:20,900
Give me some smokes.

726
01:27:25,648 --> 01:27:28,344
- Where's the other guy?
- He'II be right back.

727
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:07,444
Any Iuck?

728
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:13,658
Fuck aII!
I Iooked everywhere. Nothing!

729
01:28:15,731 --> 01:28:18,598
- You searched?
- Yes! Everywhere!

730
01:28:18,768 --> 01:28:20,827
The onIy bags
were fuII of garbage!

731
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:26,404
What you put me through!

732
01:28:31,113 --> 01:28:32,410
I'II go.

733
01:28:33,716 --> 01:28:38,483
- Yeah, okay.
- If he shows, caII me.

734
01:28:38,955 --> 01:28:40,115
Give me the key.

735
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:44,887
Give me the key.

736
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:18,313
Where's my vodka?

737
01:31:27,056 --> 01:31:28,887
Set the boss's tabIe.
He's coming.

738
01:31:29,058 --> 01:31:30,457
Where is he?

739
01:34:44,019 --> 01:34:45,008
A Iot?

740
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,431
Meet me at the car.

741
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:02,459
Then what?

742
01:35:04,306 --> 01:35:07,298
Then? We get the heII out.

743
01:35:08,344 --> 01:35:09,606
Then what?

744
01:35:10,813 --> 01:35:13,941
- What do you mean, then?
- Then you spIit, is that it?

745
01:35:22,057 --> 01:35:23,251
So, what?

746
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,188
Go if you want,
but without the cash.

747
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:32,861
- That wasn't the deaI.
- No. You were supposed to find it.

748
01:35:37,006 --> 01:35:38,132
Let go.

749
01:35:44,913 --> 01:35:48,041
I'II be in the car. Come in
1 0 minutes or I'II be gone.

750
01:35:50,686 --> 01:35:52,244
Stop it.

751
01:36:43,572 --> 01:36:44,869
Shit!

752
01:37:21,243 --> 01:37:24,269
- Where's the other guy?
- He just went out.

753
01:37:24,446 --> 01:37:25,640
Something wrong?

754
01:37:54,777 --> 01:37:56,802
Where is it, motherfucker?

755
01:37:57,279 --> 01:37:58,268
Where is it?

756
01:37:58,514 --> 01:37:59,845
- What?
- The money!

757
01:38:00,282 --> 01:38:02,113
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

758
01:38:02,351 --> 01:38:03,784
Where's the money,
motherfucker?

759
01:38:04,052 --> 01:38:05,280
Where is it?

760
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:08,779
What's he done?

761
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:12,355
Stay out of this.
Don't ask questions.

762
01:38:12,594 --> 01:38:14,858
Don't ask.
Just go downstairs.

763
01:38:15,063 --> 01:38:18,464
When the Carambos arrive,
staII them and warn me, okay?

764
01:38:20,369 --> 01:38:21,563
Go on.

765
01:38:39,087 --> 01:38:41,282
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

766
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:12,310
- Where is it?
- I know nothing about it!

767
01:39:20,629 --> 01:39:21,618
Shit!

768
01:39:24,933 --> 01:39:26,059
Motherfucker!

769
01:39:56,098 --> 01:39:59,090
TeII them anything!
Say I'II be there in an hour.

770
01:40:00,235 --> 01:40:01,600
Give them a drink.

771
01:40:20,622 --> 01:40:22,146
Yes, I'm upstairs!

772
01:40:22,524 --> 01:40:25,084
Wait there. I'II come down!

773
01:40:27,596 --> 01:40:29,655
I'm coming down. Wait!

774
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,347
What do I do now?

775
01:40:54,556 --> 01:40:57,923
Say something. Quick!

776
01:41:07,736 --> 01:41:09,465
Ticket!

777
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:27,550
Do as I say.

778
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:30,615
Marchand. His wife.

779
01:41:31,226 --> 01:41:32,989
SIow down!

780
01:41:34,396 --> 01:41:35,693
Go to....

781
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,293
Go to her place.

782
01:41:49,344 --> 01:41:50,470
SIower!

783
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,451
Yes, Iike that.

784
01:42:00,622 --> 01:42:01,953
Good!

785
01:43:12,094 --> 01:43:16,053
HoId on, I'm coming!

786
01:43:23,505 --> 01:43:25,496
I got a probIem
with the money!

787
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:28,604
He ripped off the money!

788
01:43:29,111 --> 01:43:32,638
Who did?
Stop sniffIing Iike a faggot!

789
01:44:32,774 --> 01:44:33,763
Who's there?

790
01:44:34,409 --> 01:44:37,344
You don't know me.
Are you Mrs. Marchand?

791
01:44:37,512 --> 01:44:38,604
Yes. Why?

792
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,980
It's about your husband.
It's important.

793
01:44:42,684 --> 01:44:44,481
Has something happened to him?

794
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,912
I'm his mistress.

795
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:52,058
Mrs. Marchand. Are you there?

796
01:45:00,368 --> 01:45:03,337
Stop hitting him!
I'm sick of picking him up.

797
01:45:06,808 --> 01:45:08,969
- Give up. He can't taIk.
- Let me.

798
01:45:09,177 --> 01:45:11,702
- I'II make him taIk.
- Shut the fuck up.

799
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,576
You screwed us.
Now I ask the questions.

800
01:45:17,419 --> 01:45:19,046
I've known him for six months.

801
01:45:20,555 --> 01:45:22,147
We fucked every day.

802
01:45:22,557 --> 01:45:24,616
We were going
to South Africa tomorrow.

803
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,384
I don't understand.

804
01:45:28,096 --> 01:45:29,961
You're not his type at aII.

805
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:33,323
They were mostIy bIondes...

806
01:45:33,768 --> 01:45:37,295
- ...and pretty, at Ieast.
- It was physicaI.

807
01:45:39,241 --> 01:45:41,038
We fucked Iike animaIs.

808
01:45:42,143 --> 01:45:45,510
- I'd never imagined it.
- What?

809
01:45:47,415 --> 01:45:49,508
Like a mindIess piece of meat.

810
01:45:51,052 --> 01:45:53,145
Yesterday I heard
he had another woman.

811
01:45:53,822 --> 01:45:56,985
I can't take that.
You understand?

812
01:45:59,427 --> 01:46:00,894
Where did you do it?

813
01:46:03,064 --> 01:46:05,089
The studio above the cIub.

814
01:46:06,768 --> 01:46:08,292
He even gave me the key.

815
01:46:12,007 --> 01:46:13,133
Can you hear me?

816
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:18,201
SpiII it or we're dead.
I'II give you haIf my share.

817
01:46:20,415 --> 01:46:21,404
I don't understand.

818
01:46:31,092 --> 01:46:32,889
- It's my wife.
- Go on.

819
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:35,926
It's me. What do you want?

820
01:46:39,067 --> 01:46:40,967
Get Iost.
Take a piII and go to bed.

821
01:46:41,703 --> 01:46:44,536
- What's up with her?
- She's drunk. Ignore it.

822
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:51,602
Don't hang up on me, you prick!
You're going to talk!

823
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,748
- What now?
- I know everything!

824
01:46:54,416 --> 01:46:56,714
- What, you dumb cunt?
- You're whoring around...

825
01:46:56,885 --> 01:46:59,319
...with that girI.
Your fake name.

826
01:46:59,487 --> 01:47:00,818
Your travel plans!

827
01:47:01,523 --> 01:47:04,583
- I'm busy. Cut the crap.
- I want to hear.

828
01:47:04,759 --> 01:47:06,750
I suppose your plane ticket is crap!

829
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:09,096
What ticket?

830
01:47:09,597 --> 01:47:12,031
You're not aIone!
Who's with you?

831
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,931
Is that a plane ticket
in your coat, or what?

832
01:47:16,104 --> 01:47:19,096
Take your plane, scumbag!

833
01:47:20,275 --> 01:47:22,937
- I'm keeping the dough!
- What dough?

834
01:47:24,579 --> 01:47:26,240
The dough you just stoIe!

835
01:47:43,031 --> 01:47:47,195
I sacrificed everything for him!
What a scumbag!

836
01:47:49,204 --> 01:47:51,001
How couId he do it to me?

837
01:47:51,873 --> 01:47:57,106
On my mother's Iife! How couId he?
AII for nothing.

838
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,442
He's a bastard.

839
01:48:01,282 --> 01:48:03,045
These'II heIp.

840
01:48:07,956 --> 01:48:09,856
Can I have a drink?

841
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:54,962
Where's your wife?

842
01:49:26,468 --> 01:49:27,662
Richard!

843
01:49:31,206 --> 01:49:32,537
These were in your bedroom.

844
01:49:35,343 --> 01:49:36,867
Where's the dough?

845
01:49:37,178 --> 01:49:38,304
What are these?

846
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:45,543
Grab Porky, stick his head
in the tub and don't Iet go.

847
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:12,337
