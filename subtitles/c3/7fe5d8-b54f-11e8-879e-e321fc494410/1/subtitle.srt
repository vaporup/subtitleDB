Minister!

14

A word, pIease, Minister!

15
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,743
Look this way, pIease!

16
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,037
- That's another story.
- Right.

17
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,456
Can we get an interview, pIease?

18
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:37,962
Minister, a word, pIease!

19
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,299
What's that?!

20
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You're Minister of Justice
SeIIers, correct?

21
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,237
- Go after her!
- Oh my God!

22
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,241
Stop her!

23
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,493
Get off of me!

24
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,328
GET OFF OF ME!

25
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,628
The terrorist's name is Cammy White.

26
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,841
A speciaI agent who beIongs to MI6.

27
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,844
She's being interrogated at B Base...

28
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:29,055
but she has no memory
of the past 3 years.

29
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:30,974
What do you mean?

30
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,893
It seems Iike her mind is
being controIIed.

31
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,437
By using Cammy's anaIysis data,

32
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:40,859
we shouId be abIe to figure out...

33
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,861
how ShadowIaw is creating terrorists
with speciaI abiIities.

34
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,323
We aIso know that ShadowIaw is
gathering info...

35
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:52,453
on street fighters around the worId
to create weapons Iike Cammy.

36
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,290
Turning street fighters into
terrorists, huh...

37
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,877
This man is a fighter named Sagat.

38
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,755
He is admired as a muay thai champion
and a hero in ThaiIand.

39
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:08,678
This is Bison, exiIed from the boxing
worId due to his savagery.

40
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:15,059
This is BaIrog, a Spanish fighter
feared as Crazy Viper.

41
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,272
These three are now
members of ShadowIaw...

42
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,816
as combat personneI under Vega.

43
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:29,490
ShadowIaw's crimes are increasing
in size year by year.

44
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,076
We need to destroy them immediateIy.

45
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,080
I think it's time we carry out an
investigation with the US miIitary.

46
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,504
Patterson Air Force Base

47
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,606
Major Guile!

48
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,442
PeopIe from InterpoI
are here to see you.

49
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,694
InterpoI?

50
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:15,745
I'm Chun-Li.

51
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:17,455
What do you want?

52
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,335
We've come to have a meeting on
joint investigation on ShadowIaw.

53
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,545
I'II defeat Vega.

54
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,465
What do you mean?

55
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,427
I don't need heIp
defeating Vega.

56
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,555
Major GuiIe, this is a decision
made by the miIitary!

57
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,894
We just need to defeat Vega, right?
WeII, good Iuck to you, too.

58
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,854
- I've been waiting for you.
- Hurry up and show me.

59
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,647
Right away, sir.

60
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,819
This is the newIy revamped
monitor cyborg with...

61
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,947
super performance computer equipped.

62
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,414
Images captured by this monitor
cyborg wiII be sent instantIy to...

63
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,626
the super computer at headquarters
via sateIIite communication.

64
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:57,967
It's aIready been arranged to repIace
the oId monitor robots with these.

65
00:11:58,844 --> 00:11:59,594
Good.

66
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,519
By the way, have you found him?

67
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,313
Not yet, sir.

68
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:15,193
How can you not find a man
so strong he defeated Sagat?

69
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,405
We've been tracking info
on fighters from aII over...

70
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,450
I wonder if this man named Ryu reaIIy
can be such a strong fighter.

71
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:27,163
This was recorded by the computer.

72
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:33,169
2000 is the Iimit of any fighter's
potentiaI combat capacity.

73
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,006
But 3600? I can hardIy beIieve it.

74
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,135
At any rate, you'II have to find
Ryu as soon as possibIe!

75
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,013
I don't care if it's on top of
the HimaIayas. Send cyborgs out!

76
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:11,517
Ryu, what do you see lying
ahead of your fists?

77
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,308
That's good for now.

78
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,226
Get some rest.

79
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:00,524
Before breakfast, let's go to
the valley to get some water.

80
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,359
OK!

81
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,991
You bastard! Why did you puII your
punches?! Did you go easy on me?

82
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,329
Idiot! I don't go easy on you!

83
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,832
I'II never understand you.

84
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,630
That's fine.

85
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,051
Someday, there'II be time when we
seriousIy have to fight each other.

86
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,247
Seattle

87
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,574
Sorry that I'm Iate.

88
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,579
It's not usuaI for you
to be Iate, Ken.

89
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:41,625
My opponent was harder I expected,
and it took Ionger than I thought.

90
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,086
And how did it go?

91
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,629
Of course I won.

92
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,426
So you added another titIe
to your name.

93
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,761
Yeah.

94
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:56,432
Suzhou, China

95
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,393
Hey, is Fei Long not here yet?

96
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,646
We can't shoot a movie without
the Ieading man.

97
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,774
Strange.
He shouId've headed here aIready.

98
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,361
This happens every time.
Give me a break...

99
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,204
- Hey, Fei Long.
- What's going on?

100
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,456
Just some entertainment.

101
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:21,916
Entertainment?

102
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:27,004
Some young man in the audience
is being dragged to the ring.

103
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:28,964
I didn't say anything!

104
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,135
I heard you muttering to yourseIf
whiIe watching the show.

105
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,554
You must be pretty tough,
taIking Iike that.

106
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,517
Hm, interesting.

107
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:44,021
Such a big star, yet you stiII Iike
to fight in pIaces Iike this.

108
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,398
That guy doesn't Iook so bad.

109
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,109
LittIe brat...

110
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,671
Nice one.

111
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,593
Can I chaIIenge you now?

112
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,104
You Iook Iike some fighter.
What's your name?

113
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,273
My name is Ryu.

114
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,443
I'm just a Japanese traveIer.
I have no intention to fight.

115
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,236
Not yet! It's not over yet!

116
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,656
I'II show you my speciaI!

117
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:00,908
Get ready!

118
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,979
- I can't beIieve this!
- Did he just get beaten?

119
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,334
Now I remember! Ryu!

120
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,256
A few years ago, there was a fighter
who defeated...

121
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,967
the muay thai champion,
Sagat, and went missing.

122
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,679
I think he was Japanese and
the name was Ryu.

123
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,639
Are you that Ryu?

124
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:11,437
I heard Sagat is now in ShadowIaw
training himseIf.

125
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,398
ShadowIaw? What's that?

126
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,734
- You don't know?
- No.

127
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,487
It's a crime syndicate
that's spreading...

128
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,322
weaponry and drugs
all over the world.

129
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,411
Sagat...is in a crime syndicate...

130
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,981
Ryu...we'II meet again.

131
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:10,370
Northern Seattle

132
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,567
Fight, Ken!

133
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,529
I've come here to fight you!

134
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:52,871
You don't get it, do you?
I don't street fight anymore!

135
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,708
It doesn't matter
where a fighter fights.

136
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,627
Nonsense.

137
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,887
What's the point in fighting
on the street Iike this?

138
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,850
You have honorabIe titIes
as a fighter.

139
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,687
Defeating such a man is
an honor to another fighter!

140
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,565
That's what I caII nonsense!

141
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,526
Plus, you can't defeat me.

142
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,154
No matter who comes at me,
no one can defeat me...

143
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,282
except for Ryu.

144
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:32,744
Ryu? That vagabond fighter
that went missing?

145
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,498
Don't compare me with
someone Iike him!

146
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,012
I see. I guess you're not that bad.

147
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,014
I Iike it!

148
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:25,839
What's wrong?

149
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,260
Why do you not finish me?

150
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,323
Ryu, where are you?

151
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,408
Come settle the fight soon!

152
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:06,129
Calcutta

153
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,399
Are you aII right?

154
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,828
Oh no...

155
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,424
I see. Your mother's iII.

156
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:28,230
I'm sorry.
Can you buy it again with this?

157
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:29,773
Here.

158
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,514
Damn you...!

159
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,939
What's this...?

160
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,484
My body won't...move...

161
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,416
I feeI a powerfuI aura.

162
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:56,920
He's strong.

163
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,719
- Come on!
- What's going on?!

164
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,598
- Fight!
- Hurry up and fight!

165
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,647
- DhaIsim!
- Fight!

166
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,112
Wait!

167
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:26,199
I'II Iet you win this fight.

168
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,202
What do you mean,
"Iet me win"?!

169
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,290
I feIt someone powerfuI
behind me.

170
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:38,003
Are you going to forfeit the match
with that nonsense?!

171
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,965
No. I concede the fight.

172
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,180
Then I'II take the prize.

173
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:50,807
Yeah.

174
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,059
What's wrong?!

175
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,895
I've never feIt such strong
fighting power before.

176
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,483
- What's going on?
- He stopped fighting?

177
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:13,431
Damn it!

178
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,606
Are you aII right?!

179
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:28,071
- Who are those guys?
- Terrorists from ShadowIaw.

180
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:29,823
ShadowIaw?

181
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:38,039
- Leftover money...
- Yeah, I got it. Thank you.

182
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,722
Yo! HaIf of this money is yours.

183
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,311
- Money?
- I might've Iost without you.

184
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,149
Take it.
We're both Japanese.

185
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,443
Don't be humbIe!

186
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,826
Are you sure you erased Jahan?

187
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,245
Yes, I am sure.

188
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:22,333
At the scene, the monitor cyborg
found an unknown fighter.

189
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,461
- We're investigating him now.
- Anything eIse?

190
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,299
The cyborg in SeattIe sent us
some interesting data.

191
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,968
I'd Iike you to see it as weII.

192
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,720
I'II be right there.

193
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:55,950
I hope your info was worth
my trip here.

194
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,120
Yes. Take a Iook at this.

195
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:07,837
This man has some skill,
but we found something intriguing.

196
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,967
I compared him against Ryu's image.

197
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:14,719
Who's this guy?

198
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,262
Ken Masters.

199
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:21,142
The command center pc has data
of his titIe matches.

200
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,229
But we didn't realize his relation
to Ryu.

201
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,605
What do you mean?

202
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,401
Ken and Ryu trained under the same
master for over 10 years in Japan.

203
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,905
Their fighting skills
are roughly equal.

204
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:38,409
Equal? The potential fighting
capacity is different.

205
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:43,915
We haven't acquired current data
on Ryu, but possibIy...

206
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,752
a bug in the system or Ryu hasn't...

207
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,256
been abIe to utiIize his capacity.

208
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:55,593
Ryu's feIIow pupiI...

209
00:34:56,136 --> 00:35:00,682
It might be interesting
to use him as a weapon...

210
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,767
for PIan P.

211
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,271
GeneraI, American President
Ed Pressman is...

212
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,816
a strong promoter of
arms controI IegisIation...

213
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,151
so he's heaviIy guarded.

214
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:20,410
We need him out of the way,
but it must be done carefuIIy.

215
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:25,290
If we train him with my Psycho Power,
it'II work out.

216
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,293
But...the Cammy incident...

217
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,296
Cammy achieved our objective.

218
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,674
She's being interrogated
at InterpoI.

219
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:38,636
I don't care. Her job is done.
Leave her be.

220
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:44,976
We've received interrogation footage
of Cammy at InterpoI.

221
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,479
Let me see it.

222
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:59,032
We know that you're an MI6 agent.

223
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:00,908
I don't remember.

224
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,330
We don't know why an MI6 agent
such as yourself...

225
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:07,206
assassinated the Minister
of Justice...

226
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,542
by the command of Shadowlaw.

227
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:11,586
I don't remember.

228
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,423
Cammy, your mind
was being controIIed.

229
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:19,302
We'd Iike to at Ieast
get a cIue...

230
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,095
as to how and where
you were controIIed.

231
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,722
Try to remember.

232
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:24,891
I don't remember.

233
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,019
Leave her be.

234
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:32,815
Some measIy InterpoI system is
no match for my Psycho Power.

235
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,444
But if we Ieave her be...

236
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,279
We'II take care of her in time.

237
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:41,908
More importantIy, do not sIack
on finding Ryu.

238
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,787
No matter what,
bring him to me.

239
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,205
Understood, sir.

240
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:51,751
On another note, wouId you Iike to
order the capture of Ken?

241
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,463
No need.

242
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:59,801
It's fun to trap a man Iike that.

243
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,578
What's aII this?

244
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:30,957
Investigating on your own
is against the ruIes.

245
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,835
You're nosy, Iady.

246
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,463
If you're not gonna move,
I'II just run you over.

247
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,425
Go ahead.

248
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,727
Major GuiIe, I'm sorry your best
friend was kiIIed by Vega.

249
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:58,901
Is it aIso InterpoI's job to
pry into the private Iives of others?

250
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,867
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I read your fiIe.

251
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:10,455
Vega is no Ionger just your target
to avenge your best friend.

252
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,916
Standing here taIking won't
stop Vega.

253
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,003
Then try me out and see
if I'm aII taIk?

254
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:19,338
I don't have time to pIay!

255
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,727
Vega is aIso my target.
To avenge my father...

256
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:38,149
But...I'm an InterpoI agent!

257
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,986
AnnihiIation of ShadowIaw comes
before my private grudges.

258
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:43,821
Major GuiIe...

259
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,574
if you have pride
as a member of the Air Force...

260
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,076
Iend us your heIp!

261
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,505
I don't Iike a woman who taIks
too much. Are you coming or not?

262
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,341
Of course, I'm coming!

263
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,469
Los Angeles

264
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,670
Why is there a monitor cyborg
at a nightcIub?

265
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,507
Some fighter named Dee Jay is there.

266
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:03,234
You idiots don't get my music.
Go home.

267
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:08,614
Bastard...!

268
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,006
I didn't do anything!

269
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,511
There!

270
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,055
I'm Major GuiIe, Air Force.

271
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,893
What does Major GuiIe of
the Air Force want?

272
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,936
You're my fan?

273
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,731
You've been marked by ShadowIaw.

274
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:47,028
ShadowIaw as in the scary
organization? Oh, the horror!

275
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:52,033
I'm not kidding. FaII in with them,
and you won't be pIaying anymore.

276
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,285
I was kidding.

277
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,955
Why wouId ShadowIaw mark
a guy Iike me?

278
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,251
They're gathering info on
each and every notabIe fighter.

279
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,422
- That doesn't concern me!
- Yes, it does.

280
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,967
Your data has aIready been sent
to ShadowIaw by this.

281
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:18,434
What's this monster?
Some kind of creepy doII?

282
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,227
It's a monitor cyborg.

283
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,815
It gathers information for
ShadowIaw's supercomputer.

284
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:31,322
A Iot of these are roaming around.
Watch out, and teII your friends.

285
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,088
Guile, huh...

286
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:53,761
I see he's cooperating with InterpoI
to try to stop me.

287
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:00,685
What do you say, Balrog?

288
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:03,521
Would you like to have fun...

289
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,232
with this agent, Chun-Li?

290
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,826
She's beautiful, isn't she?

291
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:30,506
An agent trying to avenge
her father...

292
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,968
Don't you think
it's admirabIe, BaIrog?

293
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,598
Patch me to Las Vegas.

294
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,685
Las Vegas

295
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:54,447
Here you are.

296
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,808
Most of the bosses in charge of
their trafficking routes are here.

297
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,102
It'II be OK. Right.

298
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:29,231
Contact the command center?
Understood.

299
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,492
That investigation has been
troubIesome IateIy.

300
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,827
Our upcoming transaction
wiII go smoothIy, right?

301
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:46,707
It's been taken care of.
5000kg of coke to London, correct?

302
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,712
CouId you teII the GeneraI
to contact me once?

303
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,047
WiII do.

304
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,008
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

305
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,512
The show is about to begin.

306
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,598
Please proceed to the hall.

307
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,895
Ladies and gentIemen,
thank you for waiting.

308
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,732
Let me introduce the fighters
competing today.

309
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,904
Emperor of the Russian
wrestIing worId...

310
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:20,366
The man with a steeI body...
Zangief!

311
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,089
His opponent is...

312
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,341
a man of unusuaI origins.

313
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:41,095
He Iearned to fight beasts
in the depths of the jungIe...

314
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:42,513
BIanka!

315
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:46,869
Ouch!

316
00:45:58,215 --> 00:46:01,175
New York

317
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:13,849
Strange...

318
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,810
She said she was going back
to her room earIier.

319
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,392
Damn it! I'm in a hurry...

320
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,928
You're...BaIrog!

321
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,226
This is strange.
I have a bad feeIing about this.

322
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:22,853
Pick it up!

323
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,235
What's that?!
Chun-Li!

324
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:41,431
SIowIy skinning a cornered
rabbit...that's what I Iike.

325
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,061
This aIso Ioves to suck the bIood
of especiaIIy cute rabbits.

326
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,223
My...my beautifuI face...!

327
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,353
I'II kiII you!

328
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,198
God damn it...

329
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:08,161
Chun-Li!

330
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:10,872
Are you OK, Chun-Li?!

331
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,295
- It was BaIrog.
- What?!

332
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:25,470
Chun-Li! Chun-Li!

333
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:27,556
Chun-Li!

334
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,934
Then what happened to BaIrog?

335
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:33,729
He was handed over to the NYPD?!

336
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,023
We're currentIy tracking
monitor cyborgs here.

337
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,235
They've been spotted around
Ken Masters...

338
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:43,739
winner of the NationaI Fighter's
Championship. He Iives in SeattIe.

339
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,493
Yes. UnIike no-name
street fighters...

340
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:53,832
he's got skiIIs.
I'm sure Vega wiII approach him.

341
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:59,504
We're aIso investigating Ryu,
who trained with Ken.

342
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:03,175
We've heard that a fighter
who headed for ThaiIand...

343
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,927
from India seems to fit his profiIe.

344
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:09,347
OK. You track down that guy,
Ryu, as well.

345
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:12,809
I'm worried about Chun-Li...

346
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,978
I'll wait here at the hospital
for a little bit longer.

347
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:20,233
As soon as things are settIed here,
I'II go meet Ken in SeattIe.

348
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,320
Please have Ken's file ready.

349
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:26,990
Lake Washington

350
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:49,221
EIiza...

351
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,264
You wanna get married?

352
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,811
What is this aII of a sudden?

353
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:57,270
You don't want to?

354
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,773
That's not what I mean.

355
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:03,443
You've never taIked about
anything Iike this before.

356
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,237
Then why not?

357
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:06,863
But...

358
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:08,740
But...?

359
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:12,035
It's not Iike you.

360
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:14,996
Did something happen?

361
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:16,540
Nothing speciaI...

362
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:15,473
Ken!

363
00:57:22,732 --> 00:57:26,234
Ken, you ARE acting unusuaI today.

364
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,194
Sorry.

365
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:54,554
Thank you.

366
00:57:57,308 --> 00:58:00,435
What you said before...I accept.

367
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,772
- EIiza...
- I Iove you.

368
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:13,949
CaII me Iater.

369
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,062
Ryu, I'm tired of
waiting for you...

370
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:53,947
General, the target's
car is in sight.

371
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,573
Good. Move in closer.

372
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,370
Bastard!

373
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,130
What the heII?!

374
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,434
You're Ken Masters, right?

375
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:06,519
I've come to pick you up.

376
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,606
Pick me up?!
Who are you?!

377
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,651
I'm Vega, the GeneraI of ShadowIaw.

378
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,072
Vega? Never heard of you.
What do you want?

379
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,450
I'II turn you into a strong fighter.

380
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:23,787
Creepy oId man. Go away!

381
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:28,041
I wiII turn you into a fighter
stronger than Ryu!

382
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:31,795
Ryu? You know Ryu?!

383
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,632
The name Ryu gets you serious, huh?

384
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:38,134
Shut up!
It's none of your business!

385
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,443
You monster!
What are you gonna do with me?!

386
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,286
Using some weird move...

387
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:09,249
No use fighting against
Psycho Power.

388
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,292
Psycho Power?

389
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:19,926
Ken, do not resist. Obey me.

390
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:21,094
Shut up!

391
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,444
Ken, obey me.

392
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:44,868
Who wouId obey a monster!

393
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,453
You don't understand, do you?

394
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,770
You're reaIIy something.

395
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:16,524
I'm Iooking forward to growing you.

396
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:27,493
What does it mean for you to come
aII the way to see Ken Masters?

397
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:30,413
Ken's been marked by Vega.

398
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:56,689
- Is this Ken's car?
- Yes, no doubt.

399
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,192
We're too Iate.

400
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,947
New York Branch of Interpol

401
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:11,371
Regarding the Iocations of ShadowIaw
branches and monitor cyborgs...

402
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:17,001
no bases have been spotted around
SeattIe except for warehouses.

403
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,712
If Ken has been taken...

404
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:23,466
it wouId be to where the other
fighters were trained by Vega.

405
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:25,426
Do we have any info on such bases?

406
01:03:26,387 --> 01:03:28,429
We haven't been abIe to Iocate
their training faciIity yet...

407
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:32,433
but their Iarge command center bases
are Iocated in East Asia.

408
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:33,935
Major GuiIe...

409
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,106
speaking of East Asia,
we found the Iocation of Ryu...

410
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,108
Ken's feIIow pupiI.

411
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:43,194
That's the man who was
in India. Where is he?

412
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:47,824
In the mountains near the Laotian
border, on the Thai side.

413
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,536
Are there monitor cyborgs
in pIace around Ryu?

414
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,622
Yes. We've caught some...

415
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,043
but Ryu has been moving around
through China, India, ThaiIand...

416
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:02,088
and the objective of
these movements is unknown...

417
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,591
so it doesn't look like specific
cyborgs are tracking him.

418
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:11,848
According to our data, Ryu possesses
the same skiII IeveI as Ken.

419
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,058
There's no reason why Vega
wouId Ieave him be.

420
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:20,606
We'II approach him first and try to
disrupt his contact with ShadowIaw.

421
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:27,113
How is the miIitary/InterpoI joint
pIan to stop ShadowIaw progressing?

422
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:31,451
We've aIready Iocated most of
their Iarge bases.

423
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:34,162
We start from East Asia,

424
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:37,999
especiaIIy the command center
near the Cambodian border...

425
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,669
We've pIanned a Iarge scaIe attack
on it by our speciaI forces.

426
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:14,494
Chun-Li...

427
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:17,955
We've finaIIy Iocated
Vega's main base.

428
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:22,919
I'II avenge you and your
father with my own hands.

429
01:05:32,388 --> 01:05:35,848
You probabIy want to do it
yourseIf...

430
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:39,018
but this time, Iet me
handIe it whiIe you rest.

431
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:43,523
I'm going now.

432
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,188
Ken...

433
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:09,734
I see the source of your power
is your rivalry against Ryu.

434
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,028
Very well.

435
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:17,825
Let me enhance that rivalry
with my Psycho Power.

436
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:50,668
Ryu, are you OK?

437
01:08:52,713 --> 01:08:53,796
Yeah, I am.

438
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,235
Thank you.

439
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,446
Another one!

440
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,450
Major GuiIe.

441
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,496
We're nearing the mountains
at the Laotian border.

442
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:10,748
OK.

443
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:17,922
General Vega.

444
01:10:19,383 --> 01:10:22,635
We just received word that
a miIitary heIicopter...

445
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:25,346
with GuiIe on board is nearing
the Laotian border.

446
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:28,349
Looks Iike they've Iocated Ryu.

447
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,143
GuiIe's going to Ryu?

448
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:36,899
They're trying to beat me
to the punch.

449
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:41,153
Let's take Ken and go see them.

450
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,573
But Ken isn't compIeteIy...

451
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:45,783
That's fine.

452
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:50,746
I'm just going to Iet them
have a fataI match...

453
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,874
Then I'II come back with Ryu.
Get things ready right away.

454
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:55,376
Yes, sir.

455
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:01,632
GeneraI, Iet me fight Ryu.

456
01:11:03,552 --> 01:11:07,388
Sagat, you're an important
fighter for ShadowIaw.

457
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,640
Forget that oId grudge with Ryu.

458
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:14,186
But if I don't fight him again,
my honor...

459
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,481
The honor of a fighter...
MeaningIess.

460
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:21,193
Your enemy is now the whoIe worId.

461
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:22,653
But...!

462
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:28,367
Sagat, ShadowIaw's ruIes state that
you are not to disobey me!

463
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,994
You know very weII.

464
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:32,663
I have another order for you.

465
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:37,293
Go to New York right away and
cIean up BaIrog and Cammy.

466
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:41,130
In ShadowIaw, you are not to faiI
executing my pIans, either.

467
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:57,855
Thailand, in the mountains

468
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,830
Hey Ryu, why don't we take a break
and have some tea?

469
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:58,374
Sure.

470
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,753
Looks Iike it's going to rain.

471
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:12,513
What's that?

472
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:24,942
Ryu, Iook. Someone's coming.
Odd to get visitors way out here.

473
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:43,419
Are you Ken Masters' friend, Ryu?

474
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:45,713
Yeah. Who are you?

475
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,841
Major GuiIe, US Air Force.

476
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:50,676
Did something happen to Ken?!

477
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:54,597
He's been kidnapped by a crime
syndicate caIIed ShadowIaw.

478
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:56,432
Ken's been kidnapped by ShadowIaw?!

479
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,685
He'II be used to carry out terrorism.

480
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:03,147
Ken wouId never Iend a hand to
a crime syndicate.

481
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:06,025
They've brainwashed him.

482
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,277
Ken's become a terrorist...

483
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,575
- Vega's personaI aircraft!
- What?!

484
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:16,827
So many guests today...

485
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,002
And a rude one at that.

486
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:46,690
Ken!

487
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,784
You finaIIy showed up, Vega.

488
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:59,703
It's been a whiIe, Major GuiIe.

489
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:04,208
We have aII the actors,
and the setting is perfect.

490
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,629
You...!
What are you gonna do with Ken?!

491
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:10,506
Ah, you must be Ryu!

492
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:17,304
Ken became a ShadowIaw fighter
in pIace of you.

493
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,433
You bastard!
Let Ken go!

494
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:33,654
Ryu!

495
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:36,573
Ken!

496
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:39,952
How do you Iike it, Ryu?

497
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:43,789
The current Ken is a kiIIing
machine that I have created.

498
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,083
WiII you be abIe to defeat him?

499
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,669
Ken, it's me, Ryu!

500
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,592
I'm sorry, but he can't hear his
best friend's voice right now.

501
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:59,388
He is a machine whose soIe
purpose is defeating you.

502
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:01,849
Ken, snap out of it!

503
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:05,477
Vega, I can't Iet criminaI scum
Iike you run rampant!

504
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,981
Sense of justice, huh...

505
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:14,695
GuiIe, an eviI mind is
the source of aII power.

506
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:21,118
Ken here wiII prove that.

507
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,831
Beating him is faster than
Iistening to his damn speech.

508
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:27,750
Here I come!

509
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,220
Who are you?

510
01:16:41,056 --> 01:16:43,766
I'II be your opponent!

511
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:49,980
GuiIe, why don't you try to
see if you can defeat me?

512
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:51,482
You'II get your wish.

513
01:16:52,192 --> 01:16:54,443
Ken, it's me.
Snap out of it!

514
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:57,988
Ken!

515
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,663
It's me, Ryu!

516
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:09,083
Snap out of it, Ken!

517
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:32,648
What's wrong? Don't you want to
avenge your friend? Come at me!

518
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,452
I won't faII for the same move!

519
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,002
Too easy!

520
01:18:17,402 --> 01:18:18,527
Oh no!

521
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:45,179
Wait... It's not over...yet...

522
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:58,400
Ken, wake up! I don't want to
fight you Iike this.

523
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:00,944
Snap out of it!

524
01:19:25,178 --> 01:20:50,429
Ken...

525
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:57,227
Ken, it's me, Ryu!

526
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:01,273
Look at me, Ken!

527
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:07,321
Ryu...

528
01:21:08,823 --> 01:21:09,573
Ken...

529
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,620
Loser...

530
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:18,498
STOP!

531
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:34,181
Ken!

532
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,769
Get out of my way!

533
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:43,398
You're going to fight me?
Interesting.

534
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:46,318
Let me see how good you are.

535
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,445
Shut up and get out of my way!

536
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:54,117
Quit taIking and defeat me.
Then you can go to your friend.

537
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,119
Move away!

538
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,395
I'm going now.

539
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:25,565
Yeah. Take care. I'II be Ieaving
here in a few days as weII.

540
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:27,442
When we meet again...

541
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,444
When we see each other next time...

542
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,283
I'II be Iooking forward to it.

543
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:39,413
You piece of...!

544
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,641
Ryu, how about it?

545
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:05,355
You, too, obey me and become
a chosen fighter of ShadowIaw.

546
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:09,234
Cut the crap!
I wiII never be your Iackey!

547
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:13,447
You stiII have strength
to resist me?

548
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,907
- Impressive.
- Shut up!

549
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:17,576
FooI.

550
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:28,879
I take it you're going?

551
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,882
Yes. I wiII miss you!

552
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:38,680
You will someday face someone
you must defeat beyond a match.

553
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:42,601
Training means moving forward
toward that day.

554
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:44,769
Beyond a match...?

555
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:50,734
Master, what do you mean,
"beyond a match"?!

556
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:53,695
Master!

557
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:58,575
I wiII teII you!

558
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,879
What was that?
What happened?

559
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:12,631
I can't remember...

560
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:19,763
What's happened to my body?!

561
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:28,772
Damn it...

562
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:45,789
That's...

563
01:24:51,546 --> 01:24:55,423
I get it. That's the aircraft
that monster was on...

564
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:57,551
I remember now.

565
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:02,556
Ryu!

566
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:11,398
That's him!

567
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:17,654
Vega!

568
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,119
Ryu!

569
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:33,837
My body...!

570
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:49,603
ControI your breathing and mind, and
cuItivate energy into spirit...

571
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:01,656
CuItivate energy into spirit...

572
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:03,408
CuItivate spirit into body...

573
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:05,952
CuItivate god to obtain the way...

574
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:08,204
Stand up straight as if my head
is being puIIed from above...

575
01:26:08,873 --> 01:26:10,874
CaIm the mind and reIax the back...

576
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:15,795
Concentrate, reIax the hip...
Put my weight on one Ieg...

577
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:19,883
ReIax the shouIders and arms...
Focus my consciousness...

578
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:23,762
Harmonize the top and bottom...
Keep the arms and Iegs moving...

579
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:26,222
Find peace in the movements...
Outside are the shapes...

580
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:29,976
Inside are the meridians...

581
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:32,771
CuItivate spirit with the breath...

582
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:36,149
- Yin and yang reach the limit...
- Make the body like steel...

583
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:39,402
Create the four elements.
Push the elements to their limit...

584
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:41,655
Form the eight symbols...

585
01:26:42,156 --> 01:26:44,532
When it reaches the limit
of rigidness...

586
01:26:44,784 --> 01:26:48,078
it becomes soft... When it reaches
the limit of softness...

587
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,122
it becomes rigid...

588
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:52,499
Ken!

589
01:26:53,084 --> 01:26:57,587
It's all about what you
see beyond your fists.

590
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:01,508
Ken, wake up!

591
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,480
Ryu...

592
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:26,616
What's wrong?
Show your power!

593
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,677
Ken!

594
01:27:46,721 --> 01:27:48,763
Ryu, we finaIIy meet again.

595
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:52,267
I'II greet you Iater.

596
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:57,605
- First, we stop this creep!
- Yeah!

597
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:03,361
You reaIIy want to fight me
no matter what.

598
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:08,533
Very weII. I'II be your opponent
in battIe. Come!

599
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,609
Ah, you were abIe to hit me.
You're as good as I expected.

600
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:52,619
Come at me harder!

601
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:06,841
What's wrong?

602
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:09,427
More!

603
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,055
More! Show me more!

604
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:48,049
Even if it's brief,
you shook me up.

605
01:29:48,843 --> 01:29:50,927
This man, Ryu...

606
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:53,221
Vega!

607
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:58,852
Ken, now!

608
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:09,070
This is it!

609
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,231
- Is this Guile?
- Yeah.

610
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,816
This is New York Central
Hospital calling.

611
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:12,443
Please come to the hospital
right away.

612
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:15,989
Chun-Li!

613
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:26,624
Watch out, you idiot!

614
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:43,808
Chun-Li!

615
01:32:50,524 --> 01:33:06,414
Chun-Li...

616
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:19,802
Your father is avenged, as promised.

617
01:33:23,307 --> 01:33:23,806
I know.

618
01:33:26,727 --> 01:33:31,189
Joint InterpoI/US miIitary operation
to destroy ShadowIaw succeeds!

619
01:33:32,066 --> 01:33:33,107
Yay, GuiIe!

620
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,319
- You brat!
- Sorry!

621
01:33:36,487 --> 01:33:38,071
I won't forgive you!

622
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:40,156
- Sorry!
- You IittIe brat!

623
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:56,047
Ryu, next time we see each other,
we'II finish our match.

624
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:57,757
Yeah.

625
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:21,656
You want a ride?

626
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:23,366
Nah, I'II waIk.

627
01:34:27,663 --> 01:34:28,704
Where are you going now?

628
01:34:29,665 --> 01:34:30,373
I don't know yet.

629
01:34:34,253 --> 01:34:36,003
Ryu, you've become strong.

630
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:37,755
You, too.
