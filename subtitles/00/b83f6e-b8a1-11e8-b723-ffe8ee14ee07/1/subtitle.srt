1
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,810
Morning.

2
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,770
Remember that rose garden
I told you about?

3
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,210
They'll be in full bloom soon.

4
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,380
Let's go see them together,
soon.

5
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,490
Say,

6
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,230
which road do you take
to work?

7
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,030
Fried eggs today?

8
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,570
Did you want something else?

9
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,140
No, they're fine.

10
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,870
- Bon appetit.
- Enjoy.

11
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,850
Bon appetit.

12
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,270
I had a scary dream last night.

13
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,680
What was it?

14
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,610
I can't remember.

15
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,010
Off you go.

16
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,980
I'm off.

17
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:15,840
SWEET LITTLE LIES

18
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,150
Iwamoto.

19
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,400
What's up?

20
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,660
- With what?
- You seem spaced out.

21
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,460
Did you get a weird call?

22
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,270
No, just a call about a college
club reunion coming up.

23
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,600
What kind of club?

24
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,400
Scuba diving.

25
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,220
That's surprising.

26
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,320
Yeah, I'd forgotten all about it.

27
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,120
OK, that's fine.

28
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,060
Also, you have two magazine
interview requests.

29
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,430
Are you free next Wednesday
starting at 2pm?

30
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,230
Sure, that's fine.

31
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,630
Also...

32
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,730
Won't you drink your tea?

33
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,640
Yes, thank you.

34
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,930
Enjoy.

35
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,070
- Thank you.
- Sure.

36
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,360
Tomi, will you take some potatoes
home? You like them, right?

37
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,260
I can have them?

38
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,670
Satoshi's mother sends so many.

39
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,900
But they always sprout
before I can use them up.

40
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,320
Potato sprouts are
poisonous, right?

41
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,980
- Solanine?
- Yeah, that's the one.

42
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,320
Maybe I'll raise them on the sly.

43
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,590
If things get bad we can
poison ourselves.

44
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,220
If things get bad?

45
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,090
That's you killing him
and yourself. Scary.

46
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,200
But you and your husband
don't need any poison.

47
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,430
Why not?

48
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,530
Because you seem
so happy together.

49
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,410
We seem happy together?

50
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,730
Welcome home.

51
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,940
Hi.

52
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,140
Thanks.

53
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,220
Tomi came over today
to discuss my exhibition.

54
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,250
She told me her
boyfriend proposed.

55
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,450
Oh, yeah?

56
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,460
But she says she's not
interested in getting married.

57
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,460
Here.

58
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,580
Tomi said an ex-boyfriend
cheated on her.

59
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,780
So she can't trust men

60
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,520
and has no illusions
about marriage.

61
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,820
That's terrible.

62
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,730
What is?

63
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,700
Him cheating on her.

64
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
If you cheat on me,
I'll stab you.

65
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,650
Good evening.

66
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,850
Welcome.

67
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,660
Nice to see you.

68
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,300
Enjoy.

69
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,170
Looks delicious.

70
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,480
You're such a good cook, Ruriko.

71
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,410
No, I'm not.

72
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,670
You put grated carrots
in here, right?

73
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,280
You don't like carrots?

74
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,880
No, I like them.

75
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,320
My brother still
won't eat carrots?

76
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,290
He's such a picky eater.
I sneak them in, but don't tell him.

77
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,990
Where is he?

78
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,190
One second.

79
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,480
Hello?

80
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,890
- You guys are such a strange couple.
- Why?

81
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Calling each other by cell
in the same house.

82
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,070
I mean, locking your room
is such teenage behavior.

83
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,370
It's a habit.

84
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,310
Don't you hate it, Ruriko?

85
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,780
But the cell phone is handy.

86
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,780
That's not what I mean.

87
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,290
You're perfect for each other.

88
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,050
A rose blooms on the bush.

89
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,770
There is no greater mystery.

90
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,370
What?

91
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,970
I saw this movie.

92
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,980
It said what couples need are
a red rose and a white rose.

93
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,190
The red rose is passion.
The white is truth.

94
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,600
Couples get along if they have
both of those.

95
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,160
Are you listening?

96
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,330
- Sure.
- Really?

97
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,650
Say.

98
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,650
We'll get to the station soon,
won't we?

99
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,550
Shall we stop for
a cup of tea somewhere?

100
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,460
- No, I have to go.
- Already?

101
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,760
Yeah, I have to go to the electronics store
and I won't be needing dinner.

102
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,200
We can't even spend
your day off together.

103
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,370
See you later.

104
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,170
Off you go.

105
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,530
Hello.

106
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,840
Iwamoto!

107
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,680
You never show up anymore,
not since you got married.

108
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,050
You're right.
You're looking good.

109
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,320
Of course.

110
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,550
Cheers, then.

111
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,230
Have you been diving?

112
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,760
Not at all.

113
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,730
What a waste, after you got
your instructor's license.

114
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,530
You know that hostel in Izu
we trained at every year?

115
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,840
We're all going to go diving there.
Want to join us?

116
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,440
I'd love to go,
it's been so long.

117
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,660
I wasn't sure which,
so I brought red and white.

118
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,860
- I'll have the red, then.
- Sure.

119
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,170
Thanks.

120
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,570
Cheers.

121
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,620
You're in the I.T. Business?

122
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,750
That's right.

123
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,320
Miura, what do you do?

124
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,620
I work in an aquarium.

125
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,420
You don't look the part.

126
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,830
I don't?

127
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,830
I don't mean anything by it.

128
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,960
I started diving because
I wanted to watch fish swim.

129
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,340
I love how slippery fish are.

130
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,340
I like fish so much better
than mammals.

131
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,740
Because you can't tell
what's on their minds.

132
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,940
You can't tell what's on
mammals minds either.

133
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,870
What's your wife like?

134
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,500
What's she like?
Well, she's beautiful.

135
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,770
I know that.

136
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,170
Do you ever fight?

137
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,370
Not at all.

138
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,210
What? Never?

139
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,510
You've been married 3 years, right?
You're really in love.

140
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,110
Not really.

141
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,680
She has a loose grip on reality.

142
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,290
Do you have a boyfriend?

143
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,990
No, not for a long time.

144
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,730
Do you still love your wife,

145
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,000
as much as you did 3 years ago?

146
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,610
I'll get more wine.

147
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,180
Hey.

148
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,010
Going home already?

149
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,480
Yeah, I've had it.

150
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,080
Your wife is waiting, huh?

151
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,480
It's not that...

152
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,980
See you.

153
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,120
Hey!

154
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,500
Can I see you again?

155
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
I'd like to see you again.
Can I?

156
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,900
Sure.

157
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,940
See you.

158
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,220
Welcome home.

159
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,060
Hi.

160
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,770
How was your reunion?

161
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,280
I saw Nemoto again.
He sends his best to you.

162
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,980
That's all?

163
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,580
A younger alumna gave me
guest tickets to her aquarium.

164
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,310
She said to bring you.

165
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,980
That's all?

166
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,780
Yeah, that's all.

167
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,320
Strange smell.

168
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,420
I'll take a bath.

169
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,020
Are you hungry?

170
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,690
No, I'm fine.

171
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,030
OK.

172
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,970
What a great crowd.

173
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,700
It was your most crowded
show ever.

174
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,680
Thank you so much,
you really saved me.

175
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,480
The pleasure's mine.

176
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,380
I'd like to go celebrate
but I have to go home.

177
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,810
Satoshi doesn't like being
home alone. I'm sorry.

178
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,620
No, no, next time.

179
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,690
Shall we have a sip of wine?

180
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,030
- Really?
- Remember that gift bottle?

181
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,190
Oh, great, I'll go get it.

182
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,580
Are you Iwamoto Ruriko?

183
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,180
Yes.

184
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,190
Could you give me this bear?

185
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,200
Are you the one who called?

186
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,390
You know him?

187
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,270
He keeps calling, asking for Nana.
I keep turning him down.

188
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,140
I saw them all,
but this one is special.

189
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,840
I told you, it's not for sale.

190
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,680
You like teddy bears?

191
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,050
No, not usually.

192
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,750
My girlfriend loves this bear
and just has to have it.

193
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,300
You're so kind.

194
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,700
You can have it.

195
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,310
- I can?
- He can?

196
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,010
Her name is Nana.

197
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,690
I'm home.

198
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,260
OK.

199
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,630
- You're home.
- Hi.

200
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,130
- Did you eat your dinner?
- Yeah.

201
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,680
- What did you eat?
- A beef-rice bowl at the station.

202
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,940
Oh.

203
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,950
Would you like a cookie
I was given?

204
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,850
Sure, thanks.

205
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,890
How was your show?

206
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,960
Good. Lots of people came.

207
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,670
Someone who insisted
on having Nana came.

208
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:43,770
He seemed desperate so
I gave it to him.

209
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,210
Yeah?

210
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,380
Are you renting all those?

211
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,260
I'm Tsugawa Haruo.

212
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,760
You gave me the teddy bear,
Nana, at your show.

213
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,230
Oh, hello.

214
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,630
Do you live nearby?

215
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,530
Yes.

216
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,530
Me, too, 10 minutes
by bike.

217
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,660
Miyako, this is Iwamoto Ruriko.

218
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,830
Really? Oh, wow.
It's like a dream.

219
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,740
This is Miyako, my girlfriend.

220
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,550
Is Nana well?

221
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,850
Yes, she's staying at home today.

222
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,250
I'm so happy to meet you.

223
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,550
Could we buy you a cup of tea?

224
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,600
I'm sorry.
I don't have time today.

225
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,390
Too bad, but next time.

226
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,770
OK, next time.
Excuse me.

227
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,300
Promise?

228
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,870
OK, I promise.

229
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,700
Hello?

230
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,430
Oh, sure.

231
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,540
Why do you play music while
you're playing a game?

232
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,240
I kept knocking.

233
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,840
Sorry.

234
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,920
I found some lychees
today, still on their branch.

235
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,620
Oh, yeah?

236
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,950
Enjoy.

237
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,420
Thanks.

238
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,960
What?

239
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,200
Can I sit next to you a little?

240
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,170
Sure, go ahead.

241
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,820
Ruriko.

242
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,890
Yes?

243
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,080
Um, why do you
want to be here?

244
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,990
Am I bothering you?

245
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,030
It's not like that.

246
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,330
There you go.

247
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,910
Thanks.

248
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,850
There isn't enough romance
in this house.

249
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,820
- Romance?
- Yes, romance.

250
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,350
That's not true.

251
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,510
Yes it is true.

252
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,360
What should I do?

253
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,660
I don't know.

254
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,070
To tell you the truth,
I don't even know if we need it.

255
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,410
But I do know it's missing.

256
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,310
Maybe it's missing because
it's not necessary.

257
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,810
Sometimes when I'm with you,
I get so lonely.

258
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,290
I'm sorry.

259
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,980
This room is so relaxing.

260
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,080
Maybe because
the table's so cold.

261
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,620
Here, enjoy.

262
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,480
What is this?
It looks like a potato.

263
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,780
It's called "Pomme de terre,"
a French pastry.

264
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,790
It's made out of potato
and marzipan.

265
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,300
I see, there's even a sprout.

266
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,630
Do you have a boyfriend?

267
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,630
I do.

268
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,700
A lover actually.

269
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,710
He pays me so he's a lover.

270
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,400
Did I surprise you?

271
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,710
No.

272
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,940
Don't tell my brother, OK?

273
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,350
But you know, recently,
he's cooled off.

274
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,950
Want to know a good tip?

275
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,560
Solanine is best
for a double suicide.

276
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,390
Potato sprouts have a poison.

277
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,460
If you grow lots of them, cook them
and eat them together, it's over.

278
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,180
Solanine isn't a poison.
You'll just get a sick stomach.

279
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,280
Really?

280
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,320
That's right.
You're so funny.

281
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,590
I see.

282
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,840
Hello?

283
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,140
Yes, he is.

284
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,340
OK, I'll tell him.

285
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,850
Iwamoto, a guest
for you at reception.

286
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,280
A guest?

287
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,930
- Were you surprised?
- Yeah.

288
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,660
I'm sorry, I just suddenly
wanted to see you.

289
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,630
I thought lunchtime
would be OK.

290
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,670
Sorry, is it creepy?

291
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,760
No, not at all.

292
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,270
It feels nice to be outside.

293
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,040
I work at the aquarium everyday,

294
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,240
so I feel like I'm
locked up somewhere.

295
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,090
You should have called first.
I'm not always at work.

296
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,990
Well, it's fine.
I just took a chance.

297
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,890
Besides, you were there.

298
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,860
Shall we sit here?

299
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,270
For you.

300
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,400
Thanks.

301
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,010
These lunch boxes are
really famous.

302
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,420
I'm into gourmet stuff
and I love to eat.

303
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,780
I can tell.

304
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,790
That's mean.
Are you saying I'm fat?

305
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,720
No, no, no.

306
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,260
Here's some tea.

307
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,760
Thanks.

308
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,930
You never visited the aquarium.
I gave you those tickets.

309
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,130
Yeah, sorry.

310
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,340
What's your job
at the aquarium?

311
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,840
My job?

312
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,750
Well, let's see.

313
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,680
It's not a glamorous job.
Prepare their food and clean up.

314
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,050
And fish eat fish.

315
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,950
So my hands always
smell fishy, right?

316
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,750
They don't smell.

317
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,990
Really? I'm glad.

318
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,560
I just had a good idea.

319
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,400
Let's eat lunch together
every Wednesday.

320
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,370
Wednesday's my day off.

321
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,370
It was just an idea.

322
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,660
- Thank you.
- Thanks. I'll just check inside.

323
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,760
Oh...

324
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,460
I'm not sorry.

325
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,670
I always wanted to.

326
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,170
Always?

327
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,510
Since I first met you
at your show.

328
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,730
I have to go home.

329
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,440
OK, see you.

330
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,870
Why do you look scared?

331
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,800
I'm not.

332
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,300
Hold me.

333
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,190
Hold me until I say it's OK.

334
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,720
Thank you.

335
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,370
I like windows.

336
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,670
Outside it's night and it's dark,
but inside,

337
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,300
it's safe.

338
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,480
Want to go to your room?

339
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,490
No, I...

340
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,720
You want to play your
game, right? Go ahead.

341
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,690
Thanks.

342
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,500
My fourth one.

343
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,900
What?

344
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,330
I have a promise with Satoshi.

345
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,940
To not smoke more than
10 cigarettes a day.

346
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,180
I try to keep stupid promises.

347
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,950
How often do you do it
with your husband?

348
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,690
Do what?

349
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,750
This.

350
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,760
We don't.

351
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,950
Not true.

352
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,550
Be careful.

353
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,070
It's true.

354
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,200
Of course, we did it for a while,
after we got married.

355
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,170
But not in the past 2 years.

356
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,610
Huh.

357
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,100
But you sleep together?

358
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,570
In a double bed?

359
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,580
Yes.

360
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,790
We'd better stop doing this.

361
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,370
Why?

362
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,080
Because it scares me.

363
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,160
I'm scared, too.

364
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,200
You won't stop this, Ruriko.

365
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,360
Why do you think so?

366
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,470
Because you're passionate.

367
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,780
Why do you think so?

368
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,990
Probably because I am, too.

369
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,120
What does it mean
to be passionate?

370
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,240
I have to go home.

371
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,580
I've fallen for someone.

372
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,750
Even though I only want
to love my husband.

373
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,410
I'm fine, I'm fine.

374
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,950
I won't be that late,
I'm fine.

375
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,150
OK.

376
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,850
Will do.

377
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,450
Enjoy.

378
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,290
- Shall we?
- OK.

379
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,950
Cheers.

380
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,260
Delicious.

381
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,700
Yes, it is.

382
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,900
Is this OK? Was your wife mad
because it was so sudden?

383
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,270
I told her I'm with
a club member.

384
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,310
Right.

385
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,240
The one called Miura.

386
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:05,110
She remembered that you came
to our wedding after-party.

387
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,320
She remembered you're cute.

388
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,520
Doesn't your wife get jealous?

389
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,960
She does.

390
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,530
My wife says, she's jealous of not just
women, but my boss, my colleagues,

391
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,930
even my desk at work.

392
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:25,440
Strange.
Sounds a little complicated.

393
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,940
I can't really understand that.

394
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,840
But that's probably because
you're so honest about everything.

395
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,040
You think?

396
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,780
She won't know
if you don't tell her.

397
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,950
Excuse me.

398
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,570
This is the best restaurant
in Tokyo.

399
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,410
It's in the magazines and usually
there's a one month wait for a table.

400
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,970
Thanks for the food.

401
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Isn't this absolutely delicious?

402
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,510
I don't like shrimp.

403
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,290
You don't? Really?

404
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,590
Then, I'll eat yours.

405
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,410
I'm so happy.

406
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,620
Meeting at night,
it feels like a real date.

407
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,350
You think?

408
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,060
Will you see me again at night,
from time to time?

409
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,010
Remember those plans to
go diving with Nemoto?

410
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,700
- They were canceled.
- They were?

411
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,210
Nemoto said he couldn't go,
even though it was his idea.

412
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,780
I see, too bad.

413
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,280
Yes, too bad.

414
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,180
So, shall we go?

415
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,790
Together, the two of us.

416
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,290
It was just an idea.

417
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,650
Satoshi, do you think
I'm passionate?

418
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,590
Passionate?

419
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,260
No.

420
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,060
Really?

421
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,870
Oh, good.

422
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,690
Ruriko.

423
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,490
Yes?

424
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,290
Do you have any secrets
you keep from me?

425
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,830
Of course, I do.

426
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,970
Diving?

427
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,670
I'm not going diving,
Satoshi is.

428
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,380
Why are you going, too?

429
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,680
I'm going to read on the beach.
I like staring at the ocean.

430
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,990
So do I.

431
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:43,720
It's on a holiday,
so I couldn't see you anyway.

432
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:48,230
I'm not mad I can't see you, I don't
want you to travel with another man.

433
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,800
He's not another man.
He's my husband.

434
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,640
What?

435
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,750
One more time.

436
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,760
I'm already dressed.

437
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,660
Undress again.

438
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,670
What a beautiful day.

439
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,180
Say, what will you do
if I break up with Miyako?

440
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:50,590
I wouldn't do anything.
There's nothing I can do.

441
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,200
I thought you'd say that.

442
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,330
I have to go home.

443
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,470
Wait, I'll see you home.

444
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,170
You can sleep.

445
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,370
No, I'm fine.

446
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,410
I feel like we're running away.

447
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:47,810
From what?

448
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,680
It doesn't matter what.

449
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,340
Here.

450
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,440
Take a look.

451
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,750
It's amazing.

452
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,650
It's nice to share memories.

453
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,000
We see the same things and
remember the same things.

454
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,560
Are you newlyweds?

455
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,230
Is that how we seem?

456
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,330
Yes, you get along so well.

457
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:36,760
To tell the truth, we're eloping.

458
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,960
What is it?

459
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,330
This spot OK?

460
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,930
Yes, I'll be reading.

461
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,380
I'll be off, then.

462
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,640
Isn't it a little creepy?

463
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,280
Diving where people have died?

464
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,060
If you say that, you can
never go diving.

465
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,960
I see your point, but...

466
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,460
Be careful, OK?

467
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:53,610
You're unbelievable.

468
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,820
I'm sorry,
but I had to see you.

469
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,350
What on earth were you thinking,
doing this?

470
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,360
I looked for you for 2 hours.
Thankfully, it's a small harbor.

471
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,370
I heard about the double suicide.

472
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,070
You did?

473
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,670
I thought it was you two.

474
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:15,900
Why?

475
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,070
I wonder why...

476
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,210
Have you seen the ocean?

477
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,270
Yes, plenty.

478
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,910
Let's go, then.

479
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:40,990
I had to see you.

480
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,090
I missed you, too.

481
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,700
I had to come to see you.
Don't be mad.

482
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,800
Why would I be mad?

483
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,040
I'm so happy to see you.
That's the truth.

484
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,710
- But...
- But?

485
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:01,340
No, it's nothing.

486
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:36,880
Aren't you cold? I am.
I'll make some tea.

487
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,720
It's OK, sit down.

488
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,000
Thank you.

489
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,400
If you hadn't invited me,

490
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:57,200
I might never have gone
diving again in my life.

491
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:02,580
No, I'm the one that's happy
being able to dive with you.

492
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,570
Oh, I'm so happy.

493
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,690
I was afraid you might not
really show up.

494
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:14,760
That I couldn't see you.

495
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,990
Actually, I was
a little anxious, too.

496
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,590
That you might not be here.

497
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,260
Of course I'd be here.

498
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:28,360
Anywhere you ask me to.
I promise.

499
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,280
When I was waiting for you,
all alone,

500
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:42,880
and just listening to the waves,

501
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:46,820
it really cleared my head.

502
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:52,230
I was just filled up
with wanting to see you.

503
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,020
I bet you can't imagine
the terror of losing you,

504
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,930
if I ask you for more.

505
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:07,240
I have to go.

506
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,970
Stay a little longer.

507
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,740
Satoshi's a window.

508
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,680
Satoshi is my window.

509
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,550
Good morning.

510
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,620
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

511
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,730
Hey, poached eggs, today?

512
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,430
Yes, they're poached.

513
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:34,980
- That's great, I've been craving one.
- Craving?

514
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,650
I'm glad.

515
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:43,110
We think alike.

516
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,890
Bon appetit.

517
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:47,650
Enjoy. Bon appetit.

518
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:38,400
The human body is warm, isn't it?

519
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,040
You didn't know?

520
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,170
I'd forgotten.

521
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,550
Maybe what I really want
is your body heat.

522
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,620
I have to go.

523
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,960
Women look so small
when they're dressed.

524
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:10,070
Why do they look so big
when they're naked?

525
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,270
We do?

526
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,280
The four of us should
go out together.

527
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:30,220
Miyako wants to see you.
Besides...

528
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,290
Besides?

529
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,640
I want to see what he's like.
Your husband...

530
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,940
Thanks.

531
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,950
Thank you.

532
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,690
It's delicious, isn't it?

533
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,570
Oh, it's Nana.

534
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:24,480
I brought Nana here to see you.

535
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,980
I often take her abroad
with my job.

536
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,640
Oh, where do you work?

537
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,580
At a travel agency.

538
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:36,290
I escort newlyweds and
elderly couples on tours.

539
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,660
So, Nana's been
all over the world.

540
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,160
Until I met Nana,

541
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,840
I thought only lonely people
wanted teddy bears.

542
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,700
But I was wrong.

543
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:56,040
The bears you make are lonely.

544
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,880
Please.

545
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,680
Thanks.

546
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,050
Don't you attend?

547
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,190
Ruriko's shows.

548
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,850
It's just not a world
I understand.

549
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,890
I keep meaning to go...

550
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:18,400
Not me, I'd be
the first one there.

551
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:22,670
I mean, if it was
Miyako's show.

552
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:27,370
What are you talking about?

553
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,670
I'm the jealous type.

554
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,270
I wouldn't even want
other people to see it.

555
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:47,390
He doesn't need to see my
shows for us to be connected.

556
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,460
It's scary.

557
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,460
What is?

558
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:26,900
I feel like we get better
each time we meet.

559
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,770
You don't want us
to get better?

560
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,080
That's not what I mean.

561
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,910
You're so mean.

562
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,960
Leaving already?

563
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,860
I feel too comfortable here.

564
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,460
If I stay, I won't be able
to leave.

565
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,300
Then I hope you can't leave.

566
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:43,570
You can't leave and you don't.

567
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,580
Don't be impossible.

568
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,380
Ruriko.

569
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,090
What?

570
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,120
I might break up with Miyako.

571
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,660
I want to break up.

572
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,770
Even though our breaking up
might not affect you.

573
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:25,850
Why don't you say something.
Tell me it doesn't affect you.

574
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,960
Just be your normal, rational self
and say it doesn't affect you.

575
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,670
Either that, or...

576
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:46,370
Or just lie and tell me
it does affect you.

577
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:59,710
It does affect me.

578
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:05,220
And that's not a lie.

579
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,830
I can't lie to you.

580
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,530
You know that, right?

581
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:24,540
Because you won't
lie to me, either.

582
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,450
And you see...

583
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,860
See what?

584
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:54,880
Do you know why
we can't lie to each other?

585
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,310
We lie to whomever we
want to protect.

586
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,310
Or whatever we're trying
to protect.

587
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,110
Just the way you lie
to Miyako.

588
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:14,720
And the way...
I lie to Satoshi.

589
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:34,140
But I love you.

590
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,690
You're cruel.

591
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,450
Ruriko?

592
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,980
I'm sorry.
Time for tea?

593
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:19,580
No thanks.

594
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:26,320
The moon is white tonight.
Did you notice?

595
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:40,740
Ruriko.

596
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,340
Yes?

597
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,910
Want me to hold you?

598
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,860
It's a first.

599
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:01,360
Your wanting to hold me.

600
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,970
Thank you.

601
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,810
Congratulations.

602
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,560
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

603
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,600
How did he know?

604
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:16,870
I told them it was our anniversary
when I reserved.

605
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:18,460
Really?

606
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,470
This is a first.

607
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,780
Well, then...

608
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,680
That's all right.

609
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,390
You act like it's special.

610
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:33,180
It is special.

611
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:38,690
But we'll be back next year.
Marriage is forever, right?

612
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:52,640
What a lovely restaurant.

613
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,710
A co-worker told me about it.

614
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:58,210
Please thank them for me.

615
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:02,640
It's crowded, isn't it?

616
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:06,750
It's popular.
The best restaurant on Tokyo.

617
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,260
It's in all the magazines and
takes one month to book.

618
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,950
Really?

619
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,200
Not hungry?

620
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:44,930
Come on,

621
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,220
say something.

622
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,060
Can I hold your hand?

623
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,330
What are you thinking?

624
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,250
Nothing... What?

625
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,350
Nothing.

626
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,360
What is it, Tomi?

627
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:31,870
I know it's sudden.

628
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:37,070
I'm going to get married.

629
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,770
Congratulations.

630
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,870
Thank you.

631
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:57,280
I'm sorry to be late.

632
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:58,790
No, I'm sorry.

633
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:02,350
Don't be. I got to take
a break, so I'm happy.

634
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:06,830
Suddenly, I wanted
to see you at work.

635
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:14,970
Is it OK?
Here at your job?

636
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:19,630
There are lots of couples here,
so we'll stand out less.

637
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:27,440
Every day, I marvel at how many
different kinds of couples there are.

638
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:33,250
It's mysterious how in couples,
males and females start to look alike.

639
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,050
Look.

640
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,550
See?

641
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,960
Don't they look alike?

642
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:44,890
And those two, too.

643
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,850
Something wrong?

644
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,720
I'm sorry, I just
remembered a deadline.

645
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:15,430
I'm sorry, I'll make it up
to you next time.

646
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:52,660
What were you doing?

647
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,800
Nothing special.

648
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,470
Nothing?

649
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:02,300
That's right.

650
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,240
Just spacing out.

651
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,510
Don't touch that.

652
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,960
Hello?

653
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:27,830
I'll be right back.

654
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:29,730
- An emergency?
- Sorry.

655
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,140
That's fine, I'm free
so I'll wait here.

656
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:36,840
If my brother comes home before
you, what should I tell him?

657
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:45,050
Ruriko... you're glowing.

658
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,020
Give this back to Haruo.

659
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:57,720
I don't want it anymore.

660
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:13,500
Don't think you're the only
lonely one.

661
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:46,600
I didn't think you'd come.

662
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:50,600
No.

663
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:55,210
I worried.

664
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,410
I worried a lot.

665
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:20,770
You hold on to this.
That's her fate.

666
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:39,390
This isn't...

667
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,090
The least bit sweet.

668
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,010
Calm down.

669
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:05,350
I'm the one that split up.
Why are you crying?

670
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,680
It makes no sense.

671
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:10,050
It makes sense.

672
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:20,300
Because I love you.

673
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:28,070
That's...

674
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:38,290
That's terribly sweet.

675
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:51,090
Ruriko.

676
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,530
See you.

677
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,760
Say...

678
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,150
This deep?

679
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,320
Hello.

680
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:16,560
Plant this, too.

681
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:18,360
Oh, sure.

682
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:24,220
Coffee?

683
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:33,130
Do you want a cup?

684
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:59,860
It's nothing to be sad about.

685
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,930
Say, look at that.

686
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:46,900
Do you know what it is?

687
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:50,640
I don't.

688
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,840
It's aconite.

689
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:58,210
Its flowers are quite beautiful.

690
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:02,450
A long time ago,

691
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,260
I used it to kill my husband.

692
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:13,200
Why?

693
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,770
No reason.

694
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:22,610
Well, I guess
because I was lonely.

695
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:32,080
Human beings are monsters
while they're alive.

696
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:35,990
But once they're dead,

697
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:40,190
oddly enough,
they become human.

698
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,030
Care for sugar?

699
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:58,200
And now?

700
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:59,710
Yes?

701
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:05,150
You're not lonely now?

702
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:09,650
Of course...
I'm lonely.

703
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:12,790
Whether you're together
or alone,

704
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,660
it's lonely.

705
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:30,510
A rose blooms...

706
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:33,980
on the bush.

707
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:42,580
There is no...

708
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:46,180
greater mystery.

709
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:52,430
A rose...

710
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:56,800
There is no greater mystery.

711
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:02,980
Past its bloom,

712
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:05,940
it falls from the bush...

713
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:10,440
as the light.

714
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:22,180
What's wrong?

715
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,810
Get closer.

716
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:08,840
I want to be even closer.

717
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:14,670
I wish that door would just
stay closed.

718
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,980
And we'd be,

719
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:23,240
trapped in here together,
forever.

720
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:45,270
See you.

721
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,840
Ruriko?

722
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:32,550
Welcome home.

723
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:36,740
What are you doing here?

724
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:39,440
Nothing.

725
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:45,450
I designed a new bear.

726
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,360
Oh, I see.

727
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:07,310
It looks like you.

728
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:13,650
Thank you.

729
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:22,020
Shall I hold you?

730
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:32,930
I'm home.

731
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,240
I'm the one that came home.

732
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:43,480
Were you away?

733
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:47,380
Yes, I was.

734
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,980
I was away.

735
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,590

736
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:58,590

01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:07,670
I'm...

739
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:15,510
I'm coming home soon.

740
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,280
We'd better get going.
It's pretty far.

741
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:19,510
Sure.

742
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,580
What's that?

743
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:29,520
It's their wedding present.
Tomi wanted them.

744
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:35,490
Remember when we talked
about sharing memories?

745
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:39,630
Maybe it's not enough
just to have memories.

746
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,600
Maybe it's more important
to remember them.

747
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:46,300
To remember them together.

748
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,470
