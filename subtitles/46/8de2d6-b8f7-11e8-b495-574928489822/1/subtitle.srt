1
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:15,592
Chichiro...?

2
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:21,286
Chichiro.... Where are you?

3
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:32,719
Chichiro...    Chichiro...

4
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:44,561
Is Chichiro a name your father gave him?

5
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:49,486
Chichirone's the name he gave himself...

6
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:54,446
I see...  What a lovely name.

7
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,798
Aaaaahhh!  There you are!

8
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,824
Now it's Sachi's turn...

9
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,371
Not yet...

10
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,904
RING...  MEOW...

11
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,856
Not yet...

12
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:09,639
RING...  MEOW...  MEOW...

13
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,946
All right...

14
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:26,740
Come on, Chichirone...

15
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,986
Come on!  Chichirone!

16
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:53,931
Sachi...   Sachi...

17
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,573
All right you two.  In you go...

18
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:44,557
THE RUNNING MAN

19
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:50,356
THE RUNNING MAN by Yoshiaki Kawajiri

20
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,113
Engine output: Check

21
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,904
Oil pressure: Check

22
00:14:09,904 --> 00:14:11,391
Heart rate: Increasing

23
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:12,916
Perspiration output: Increasing

24
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,378
Brain-wave patterns: Normal

25
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:20,469
I'd been sent there by the magazine
to do a story on Zack Hugh...

26
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,072
On him, and the unforgiving race which
had claimed so many mens' lives...

27
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:25,208
Death Circus.

28
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:31,712
For ten years, one man had reigned
as it's champion... Zack Hugh.

29
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:35,285
Many admired him for the control
he had over the machine he drove...

30
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,955
Total.  Absolute. 
Without any fear of death.

31
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:46,411
Zack the Reaper...  The Phoenix...
He'd been given many such names.  But...

32
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,780
Ground clearance: Unstable.

33
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,524
Heart rate and perspiration
output: Increasing

34
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,766
We're reading a loss
in retinal response.

35
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:06,580
The races had taken
their toll on the man.

36
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,666
The constant stress was too much; It was
destroying him, in both body and mind...

37
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:51,840
He's past his limit! That
machine's shaking him to pieces!

38
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,237
It's no good.  Pull him out!

39
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:08,595
Chief, he isn't slowing down!

40
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,349
What?!

41
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:04,752
What in God's name...?!

42
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,174
Chief!

43
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:08,727
Come on!

44
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:19,921
He crossed the finish line, and the
machine's engines revved up for more.

45
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:22,668
The race was over, but the
running man was still running...

46
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:56,203
Zack Hugh...  A
champion among champions.

47
00:25:58,494 --> 00:26:03,705
To this day, his death
remains shrouded in mystery.

48
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,794
You're aware of the coup d'etat which occured
five days ago in the Aloana Republic, are you not?

49
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:08,564
Yes sir!

50
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:18,027
You're, of course,  also aware of our company's special project
#444 we have under construction along that country's Piroru River?

51
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:19,179
Yes sir!

52
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,440
That project will give our company access to
the Aloana market... and to their resources.

53
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:33,827
However, three days ago, the new government
there unilaterally cancelled our contract.

54
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:35,720
You understand what this means?

55
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:37,217
Yes sir!

56
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:38,767
Stop saying "yes sir" all the time!

57
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:44,264
CANCELLED!  The project's been cancelled!
They've given us an order to cease construction!

58
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:50,563
THE ORDER TO CEASE
CONSTRUCTION by Katsuhiro Otomo

59
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,990
Uh-oh!

60
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:18,117
Looks like we ran a red light!

61
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:26,532
According to their orders, we must cease
construction of the project immediately.

62
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:31,931
Further, the contract fee is to be
repaid over a period of 20 years.

63
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:33,199
20 years, sir?!

64
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:37,476
Project 444 was a difficult
operation from the outset.

65
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:41,708
The land they granted to us was
a swamp surrounded by headlands.

66
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:45,216
Come rainy season, the whole
area becomes a virtual river.

67
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:48,587
When the waters recede, the
plants grow like monsters.

68
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:56,044
It's an insane, godforsaken place that just
turns back into jungle within half a year.

69
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,799
I... I see...

70
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,816
The start-up costs on #444 were enormous; it
still consumes vast amounts of our resources.

71
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:13,740
We have to shut it down
before we lose any more money!

72
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,778
Why don't you just contact the staff...?

73
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:17,514
I already ordered the supervisor
there to shut the project down!

74
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:18,311
The I don't see what...

75
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:22,772
The supervisor disappeared without a
trace shortly after I gave the order.

76
00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:23,402
Disappeared, sir?

77
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:28,681
Due to its location, it was decided that
robots would comprise the main workforce.

78
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:33,489
The only human there is that supervisor.

79
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:34,936
So...

80
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:40,463
At this moment, those stupid robots are
throwing valuable resources into the mud!

81
00:29:40,463 --> 00:29:49,939
I'm sending you out there to find that supervisor
and oversee the shut-down of project 444.

82
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,608
I'm COUNTING on you, Sugioka.

83
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:54,184
Yes, sir!

84
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:09,345
What the hell...?

85
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:25,972
You are the supervisor?

86
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,455
It's worse than he told me...

87
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:38,416
Please give me your name and
employee identification number.

88
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:41,819
H-hey!  What are you doing?!

89
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:47,251
We're outta here!  Give us a call when you're
finished and we'll come back and pick you up!

90
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:51,849
You're leaving...?  Hey, WAIT!

91
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:54,113
Take care of yourself!

92
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:58,353
Hey!  Hold it!  Come back here!

93
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:02,091
What's the big hurry, anyway?

94
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:07,958
Jeez, if they've broken my camera or anything,
it'll be coming out of their paychecks!

95
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,805
For Pete's sake, you just
can't figure these low-lifes.

96
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:22,029
I must have your name and employee
identification number for confirmation.  Yes.

97
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,937
Oh, what was his
name...?  That supervisor?

98
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,779
Do you know where he's gone?

99
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:34,123
Your failure to give me your name and ID number
leads me to conclude that you are not the supervisor.

100
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:45,363
If you are not the supervisor, then you are
unauthorized personnel and have no business being here...

101
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:48,750
Anyway, just take me to my quarters and
you can tell me what you know in detail.

102
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:57,642
Any person who is classified as a threat to construction
will be removed so that construction may continue. Yes.

103
00:31:57,642 --> 00:32:02,478
Tsutomu Sugioka.  ID number CX-88.

104
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,075
Check completed, yes!

105
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:08,855
Hmpf!

106
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:14,286
Welcome, Supervisor,
from the distant land.

107
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:16,059
Yeah, yeah.  Glad to meet you.

108
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:22,899
I am number one here at Project 444...

109
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:33,649
...and all orders relating to construction here at
Project 444 are transmitted through me, via radio.

110
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:37,728
Cripes, they're really
buzzing away down there.

111
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:48,262
This procedure is very important, Supervisor. Failure
to follow this system may result in mix-ups.  Yes.

112
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:57,586
Fine, we'll use the system to give everyone here the new orders. The
first one I want you to transmit will be the order to cease construct...

113
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:58,699
Hey!  Hold it!

114
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:01,071
I haven't finished
giving you my orders yet.

115
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:05,340
Hey!  HEY!

116
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,033
What's the meaning of this?!  Hey!

117
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:16,008
Supervisor must be tired after his long
journey.  Yes. I will now return to my duties.

118
00:33:16,008 --> 00:33:18,458
So why am I locked in?  HEY!

119
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:22,258
There are dangerous insects in the
area. It is for your safety that...

120
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:27,486
God dammit, open this door!  Hey!

121
00:33:27,486 --> 00:33:27,814
Don't you understand?!
Open up!  Come on!

122
00:33:27,814 --> 00:33:30,254
Supervisor's schedule for tomorrow is posted on
the bulletin board. It is to be followed precisely.

123
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:36,261
Come back here!   Don't you hear me? I'm
telling you to come back and open this door!

124
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:41,165
Open it.  God damn it...

125
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,163
Help!  This crazy robot's trying to kill me! To my wife, Sachiko.  I'm done for, but you must know that I
love you.  It's strange, but all I can think about now is what my mother used to say to me when I was young:

126
00:33:46,163 --> 00:34:03,138
"Study hard!"  She'd say.  "Study hard,
and you'll grow up to be a fine man...."

127
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:15,283
From a quarter of until 10:25 will be the first on-site
inspection. At 10:30, in the the resource room, we will...

128
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:17,425
There, Supervisor.  Section eight. This
section is furthest behind in construction.

129
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,306
Hey!  What's with that robot over there?

130
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,695
Overheat.  Due to the intense pace of construction
here, it's circuits are malfunctioning.

131
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:55,003
WHAT?!  Do you know how much that thing costs?
Airplanes are less expensive than those things!

132
00:35:55,003 --> 00:36:04,854
Due to this section's being so far behind schedule, I
have ordered all units here to work at peak capacity. Yes.

133
00:36:04,854 --> 00:36:09,264
My orders are to have Project 444 ready by the
due date. Some losses are to be expected.  Yes.

134
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:15,177
Listen to me!  There IS NO DUE DATE anymore! And
you're supposed to be conserving our resources, not...

135
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:18,169
Due date is only one month away.  Yes.

136
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:23,117
To make the due date, the robots
must work at peak capacity.  YES.

137
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:28,279
H-hey, what gives?
Don't get sore at me...

138
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:39,773
We will now inspect section
ten. Follow me, Supervisor...

139
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:45,601
W-wait for me!

140
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,926
Breakfast will last until
half past the hour.  Yes.

141
00:36:55,926 --> 00:37:02,603
From a quarter of until 10:25 will
be the first on-site inspection.

142
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:07,381
At 10:30, in the the resource room, will be a
report on last month's work, which you and I will...

143
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:08,563
What the hell...

144
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:13,835
We should be leaving soon, Supervisor...

145
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:19,491
Hold it!  Hold it!

146
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:24,813
I've had enough of you making a fool of me! H
much of this crap do think I'm going to take?!

147
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:34,526
Because the rainy season will soon be here, I
have ordered all robots to work at maximum output.

148
00:38:34,526 --> 00:38:38,152
Wha...  Who ordered you to do that?!

149
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:44,752
Losses have increased slightly, but
construction has been greatly speeded up.

150
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:48,048
Please be happy, Supervisor.

151
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:51,177
Increased slightly... 
 How much is "slightly"?!

152
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,318
Today's losses: 20.  Yes.

153
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:57,104
Tomorrow's expected losses: 24. Yes.

154
00:38:57,104 --> 00:39:01,560
There's no way I'm just going to stand
here and let you keep shredding our robots!

155
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,391
Now listen to me and listen good, you dumb sonovabitch
robot! You are ordered to cease construction.

156
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,822
You're to stop
immediately.  You got that?!

157
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,916
The order you have just given is
classified as an obstacle to construction.

158
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:22,412
Your clearance to
command me is now void.

159
00:39:22,412 --> 00:39:26,258
Shut up!!  I'm telling you
to stop, you stupid robot!

160
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:33,264
All obstacles to construction
must be removed.  Yes.

161
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:50,231
Removed...?

162
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:57,223
From this day forward, your on-site
inspections are cancelled permanently.  Yes.

163
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:35,190
Madness...

00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:59,775
Good morning, Supervisor. I
have brought you your breakfast.

165
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,416
It worked!

166
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:24,059
Even if I am destroyed,
construction will never cease.  Yes.

167
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:24,135
There will be no changes.

168
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:33,552
We must complete by...
due-date... Yes.. yes...

169
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:53,057
God damn you!   You bastard!!!

170
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:57,193
It's no use.  Those stupid
things are still working...

171
00:42:57,193 --> 00:43:05,736
Yeah, of course.  He was just a terminal, after all. They
won't stop unless I shut down the main core completely!

172
00:43:10,536 --> 00:43:12,583
This cable should lead me there...

173
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:22,448
Emergency!  Priority one
message from headquarters!

174
00:43:22,448 --> 00:43:27,138
Sometime earlier today, another coup
d'etat occured in the new Aloana Republic.

175
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:36,171
The new government has been restored,
and Project 444 has been reinstated!

176
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:40,341
Repeat, Project 444 has been reinstated!

177
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:45,650
Tsutomu Sugioka.  It's me, Maruyama.

178
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:51,084
Sugioka!  It's me!  Do you read me?

179
00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:53,731
Come in!  Sugioka...!
