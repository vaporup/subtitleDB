1
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,829
You're already cooking!
l've got something to show you.

2
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,316
- l haven't finished cooking dinner.
- Outside.

3
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,559
lt's a surprise. lt's all right.
Come on. Shut your eyes.

4
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,829
Good. Shut 'em.

5
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,638
Are you ready? Sure? All right.

6
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,230
- Turning.
- lt's cold.

7
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,113
- lt's not.
- Even the chickens are cold.

8
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,155
Step. Ready?
One, two and three.

9
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,989
OK, look. No, that's not it. Shut 'em.

10
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,557
Now, Frank, how far are we going to go?

11
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,035
- You're all right.
- The dinner...

12
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,471
The dinner's fine. OK.

13
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,389
Almost, almost. Now, now!

14
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,918
- Oh, it's...
- lsn't that beautiful?

15
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,117
- lt's lovely.
- l won it in a poker game in ltaly.

16
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,839
- Drive it carefully, honey.
- l will.

17
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,029
- Enjoy it, but be careful.
- l will.

18
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,156
You're such a mom.
Ready? We're going for a ride.

19
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,557
- No, l have to finish dinner.
- Mom, one ride.

20
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,389
- Watch this, Ma, no hands!
- No, don't!

21
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
l wouldn't do that, come on.

22
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,038
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- My pleasure.

23
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,755
This is fun, right?

24
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,349
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

25
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,189
- Careful!
- Hey, l'm driving here.

26
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,196
l'm home.

27
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,476
Mortars coming in! Mortars coming in!

28
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,438
Machine gun on the right flank!

29
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,752
Medic!

30
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,637
Well, it works. My spike works.

31
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,552
- OK.
- Easy, easy.

32
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,320
- OK.
- Take it easy.

33
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,431
No!

34
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,113
<i>I've got a headache.</i>
<i>Have you got some |Wite</i>-<i>Out?</i>

35
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,634
Ma. Ma!

36
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,438
You don't know what you're into.
But you're a long way from home.

37
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,760
lt's so confusing.
Where to go? Where to go? Yes.

38
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,349
- Ma!
- Oh, bother.

39
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,632
What the hell are you?

40
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,474
- They're doodles.
- Cartoons?

41
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,071
- Don't get too close.
- l can't believe what l've done.

42
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,717
My spike was supposed to send me
to your world. lnstead, you're here.

43
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,716
This man's not dangerous.

44
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,550
We may not be real to you yet,
but we will be.

45
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,278
You've come to a whole new world.
You've done something extremely rare.

46
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,314
You're in a real place
called the Cool World.

47
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,920
Strange. Say ''ahh''!

48
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,999
But when it comes to
making the trip in the body...

49
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,237
...l've never seen it before.

50
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,233
Oh, my goodness.
l'm sorry about your mother.

51
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,833
You're cartoons.

52
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,511
- You're not real.
- We're real all right.

53
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,759
The possibility of inter-world travel
has been my obsession

54
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,918
for many, many years.

55
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,317
- Wait.
- This man is not for you.

56
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,593
He's not a police problem.
He's a mystery of science.

57
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,712
- And a hero.
- l ain't no hero.

58
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,074
Don't be so sure. With this hole l've
opened, there could be many problems.

59
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,319
- l'm Doc Whiskers. What's your name?
- Frank Harris.

60
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,671
- What did you do?
- l was a soldier.

61
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,871
You could be useful here.

62
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,116
- Where are you from?
- Vegas.

63
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,596
<i>Tomorrow, we're out of here.</i>

64
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,150
Y<i>ou're</i> j<i>ust a drawing, HoIIi.</i>
<i>But without you, I'd never have made it.</i>

65
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,639
- Y<i>ou Iook good tonight, babe.</i>
- <i>It's time you came to me,</i> J<i>ack.</i>

66
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,232
Come to me.

67
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,194
Oh, baby!

68
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,594
l've been waiting for you, darling.

69
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,193
Hey, Sparkey, what are you up to?

70
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,279
What makes you think
l'd tell a little punk like you?

71
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,316
He's gone soft for that tomato.
What's her name? Holli or something.

72
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,273
Enough out of you, kiddie. You're too
young to be thinking about girls.

73
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,472
Especially that girl.

74
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,989
Here, a bunch of wooden nickels.
Don't spend them all in one place.

75
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,834
D<i>id you step in it?</i>

76
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,798
<i>There's a fIower on your head.</i>

77
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,398
Hey!

78
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,673
L<i>ook out!</i>

79
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,669
l hate it when she meets guys
without telling me.

80
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,715
<i>I Iight up Iike...neon</i>

81
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,516
J<i>ust a tiny section of your affection</i>

82
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,836
<i>In my direction wiII do</i>

83
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,229
Detective Harris.

84
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,158
What a pleasure. l was just rehearsing.

85
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,390
Hello, Holli.

86
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,434
This is an exact replica
of the dress Marilyn Monroe wore in

87
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,790
L<i>et's Make</i> L<i>ove.</i>

88
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,629
l know that movie by heart.

89
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,790
The girl gets everything by the end of it.
Everything she ever wanted.

90
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,192
lt's real. l mean it.

91
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,358
l even saw a copyright date on it.

92
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,157
Rumour has it, Holli, that you had a noid
visitation at the Slash Club last night.

93
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,558
lt was just a mind slip. Nothing special.

94
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,834
You're just a regular true believer
in law and order, huh?

95
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,510
- Cut me a couple.
- Come on, let's go.

96
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,358
Beat it, copper.

97
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,515
Just doing my job.

98
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,274
Hey, Frank. Don't go just yet.

99
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,397
Come here.
l've got something to show you.

100
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,633
Guess what?
l've seen your museum of Vegas.

101
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,756
And don't start in with your Vegas
Vinnie rap. l've heard it. lt bores me.

102
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,591
Vegas Vinnie made the Spike.

103
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,157
Crossed over and became
the owner of the Union Plaza hotel.

104
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,749
Vegas Vinnie is a fairytale, Would.

105
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,318
Doodle moms tell it to doodle kids
to help them go to sleep.

106
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,956
lt could all be true.

107
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,154
You got over here, so why
couldn't he make it over there?

108
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,148
Or for that matter, why couldn't l?

109
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,959
You could help me.

110
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,470
There'll be no crossovers
while l'm around.

111
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,674
l've got news for you, pal.
l am not your ordinary doodle.

112
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,555
l've seen what these noid dames
have in the Real World

113
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,548
and l want it! Don't you see?

114
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,796
They're real.

115
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,195
They've got power.

116
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,998
When they touch something, they feel it.

117
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,274
And when they taste something,
they really taste it.

118
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,149
And when they do it with a man...

119
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,470
...they really do it.

120
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,716
What can l say?
l can't help you in that department.

121
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,596
Don't you see? Believe it.

122
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,995
l've had enough.

123
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,275
Oh, yeah? Fine. You don't want to help,
then l'll find somebody else that will.

124
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,076
Like that noid cartoonist, Jack Deebs.
He's been around a lot lately.

125
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,750
Yes, the whack-a-do
who thinks he invented this place.

126
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,793
What do you think
l've been talking about?

127
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,118
l'd watch it, 'cause there might be
two of you before long.

128
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,715
l'll tell you once.
You gotta be smarter than you look.

129
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,276
You're dealing with shit
that's way over your head.

130
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,838
Keep your legs crossed and forget
about the Real World. Thank you.

131
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,196
Would you look at those legs!

132
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,433
Stay cool, man.

133
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,392
l'm outta here.

134
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,030
- Get off the lawn.
- Shut up.

135
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,556
Get your ball and get out of here.

136
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,755
Hi, Gail, it's me, Jennifer.

137
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,879
What do you mean? l'm here.
l'll call you later, OK?

138
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,830
Oh, boy, another addict, huh?

139
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,596
My God, it's you, isn't it?

140
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,430
You're Jack Deebs, creator of
<i>CooI |WorId,</i> right? l can't believe it!

141
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,428
Do you know what an inspiration
your work is to people?

142
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,077
l know people who want to be
Holli Would when they grow up.

143
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,592
Yeah. Sparks, the Goons,
all of 'em. Oh, man.

144
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,636
Your stuff, it's like crucial spiritual
nourishment for people. They live on it.

145
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,152
My boss would
throw himself on the ground

146
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,477
and give you a lifetime gift certificate.

147
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,754
He's kind of crazy.
Hey, would you sign this for him?

148
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,152
Thanks. Go ahead.

149
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,079
So, are you living here now again?

150
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,637
- Yeah, l just got back.
- Yeah.

151
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,038
When we close,
l go down to this place for coffee.

152
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,073
They read poetry, do jazz, you know.

153
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,434
Problem is, l just got back into town,
as l said, and...

154
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,792
...l haven't really got my feet
on the ground,

155
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,231
but it's really nice of you to ask.

156
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,716
Why don't you do a book
on that guy you murdered?

157
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,755
You know, that guy you found
in bed with your wife?

158
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,274
- What do l...?
- lt's on the house.

159
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,029
Thanks. So, maybe
some other time? Thanks.

160
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,073
- Who are you?
- Who am l?

161
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,559
- l'm Jack Deebs.
- Really? l didn't realise.

162
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,911
- Nice meeting you, Jack.
- Nice to meet you.

163
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,750
See ya. Hey, bright eyes, yo!
Are you going to pay for that?

164
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,919
Gee whiz, sis, l don't know.

165
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,476
lt looks like such fun down there.

166
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,959
All l need is a four and l win.

167
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,435
lt's a four!

168
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,558
Oops, snake eyes, you lose.

169
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,679
But l won!

170
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,193
You lost. Pay up.

171
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,916
Well, my dear,
we could always take it out in trade.

172
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:54,352
Listen here, fleabag, pay up or your
inside is gonna be your outside.

173
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,953
- Slash, is that you?
- Put it there, pal.

174
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,237
Get away from me.

175
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,549
- Get away from me.
- You lost it. That's why you're here.

176
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,392
Oh, darling, l want your hair
and your neck. l could just squeeze it.

177
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,879
Let me see your ears, sweetie.
He loves me, he loves me not.

178
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,119
He loves me, he loves me not.
Oh, he loves me.

179
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,630
He loves me.

180
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,717
Now, be nice.

181
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,112
- Nice.
- Nice.

182
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,237
Hello, Holli.
You never cease to amaze me.

183
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,750
How fabulous your hair looks today.

184
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,193
Boy, can she knock it back.
How about saving some for me?

185
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,275
Yeah, come on, come on. Holli wants
to get a look at you. Come on.

186
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,751
- Come, darling, she awaits.
- A little closer. Let her see you.

187
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,829
Welcome to my world, big man.

188
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,555
Am l dreaming?

189
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,355
Am l dreaming you?

190
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,238
Or are you dreaming me?

191
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,958
l drew you. l made you.

192
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,955
Maybe l can erase you.

193
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,714
You wouldn't erase me, baby.
You're too hungry for what l got.

194
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,638
No, l'm... l'm trying to quit.

195
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,312
Since it's only a dream,
indulge your fantasies, Jack.

196
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,917
You're so real, so strong. You could
help comb my hair, tickle my mind...

197
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,156
Yes, l have failed.
Thank you. l'm calm now.

198
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,789
Those big bad guys didn't play fair.

199
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,435
l want you to tear them up until their
mother doesn't recognise them.

200
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,835
Pretty please.

201
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,997
Wait for me!

202
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,073
Got a full tank?

203
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,751
l got news for you, baby.

204
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,312
l'm made of ink, but l'm no dream.

205
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,789
- Why did you do that?
- Because l dig you.

206
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,597
This is a long dream, isn't it, Jack?

207
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,832
- The Poppers! Let's burn.
- What?

208
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,350
Let's go. Come on, come on.

209
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,233
Do you like it, Deebs?

210
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,829
- Yeah.
- Of course you do.

211
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,752
- This is your idea of heaven, right?
- Yeah. lt's amazing. lt's incredible.

212
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,956
But l won!

213
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,593
A little late for a lady
to be out, don't you think?

214
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,438
- l've got a couple of questions.
- Let it slide, officer. l'm tired.

215
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,029
Word is, you got a thing for noids.

216
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,155
Yeah, l've got a thing for noids,
but what's it to you, tough guy?

217
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,876
- You don't know how tough it is.
- You're late.

218
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,152
You're killing me.
Why are you so beautiful?

219
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,150
- What's wrong? You don't look right.
- lt's Holli. She's in heat again.

220
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,033
With that noid from last night?
Don't worry.

221
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,277
You know l worry.
Why do you always...?

222
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,675
Got ya.

223
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,758
All right, where do you want to go?
Movies, dinner...?

224
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,197
Our colour is fading. Repent, repent.
The end is near.

225
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,710
Hey, boss. We gotta go.
A thousand pardons.

226
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,074
An informant told me he's here again.
Holli and the Goons got him.

227
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,555
He's not just here on a dream?

228
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,153
- lt is time to pursue other avenues.
- Right, let's hit the bricks.

229
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,591
Yeah, yeah. l know. Be careful, Frank.

230
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,396
Oh, l think she's partial to you.

231
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,991
Yeah, but facts is facts.
She's a doodle and l'm not.

232
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,634
l guess, but did l ever tell you about
the time l took up

233
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,674
with the most delightfully stacked
hussy from the projects?

234
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,713
- Yeah.
- Right. Where to, boss?

235
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,797
- The Club.
- Right.

236
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,750
- Hey, baby, how you doing?
- Chico, is that you?

237
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,873
- l ain't no Chico. And no noids.
- He's with me.

238
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,036
Sorry, baby, no noids.

239
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,069
He's with me, too.

240
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,396
Can't let the neighbours
push us around, can we?

241
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,833
Freeze, asshole.

242
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,873
Cool World Police.

243
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,115
- Up against the wall.
- Get your hands off me.

244
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,915
- Where are your manners?
- Be quiet.

245
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,911
- Who are you? l didn't create you.
- No shit, Sherlock.

246
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,755
- What's this for?
- l'm a cartoonist. l drew this.

247
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,916
l have visions.

248
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,035
- l translate this.
- You do nothing, man.

249
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,711
This place exists with or without you.
l'm not one of your creations.

250
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:18,790
- Right. You're not pretty enough.
- Good one. Have a seat.

251
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,356
- Ordinary fountain pen?
- Right.

252
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,915
Wrong. Around here... Sit down.

253
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,430
Around here this can be a big nuisance.

254
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,518
You thirsty, Nails?

255
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,591
Get it?
One should be careful with this thing.

256
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,236
- No.
- Of course not, you're a whack-a-do.

257
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,593
But here you are, Jack.

258
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,349
And around here everything goes
except one thing.

259
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,073
What?

260
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,116
- What's that?
- Noids do not have sex with doodles.

261
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,075
Right. Noids do not have sex
with doodles.

262
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,037
lt's the oldest law.
l've never had to enforce it.

263
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,995
You cross that line, l'll slap you around
and make you piss like a puppy.

264
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,915
Jack, you think she's got a thing
for you, don't you?

265
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,194
That's sweet. But don't flatter yourself.
She's a waste of ink.

266
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,075
She's been after me and every other
noid who's been here.

267
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,796
lt's just that no one's been insane
enough to get involved with her.

268
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,230
You keep your pencil in your pocket.
Know what l mean?

269
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,069
- l'll remember that.
- You can go now.

270
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,751
- Where'd you get your hair done?
- Get outta here.

271
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,554
- All right, the show's over.
- You could've beat him.

272
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,278
You could've been somebody.
You're not yellow, are you, Harris?

273
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,112
You did well, Jack.

274
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,352
- Hey, sexy.
- lt's the man with the badge.

275
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,915
ln the flesh.

276
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,830
- Don't remind me.
- How can l help it?

277
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,673
What are you doing to me?
You're messing me up.

278
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,113
Oh, honey, you're tense.
lt's Holli again, isn't it?

279
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:22,032
Yeah, Miss Holli Would-if-she-could.
That dame. You heard anything?

280
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,472
You know
l don't listen to that sleazy cow.

281
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,829
Don't. Just don't.

282
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,033
- But why?
- Because we can never finish it.

283
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,470
lt's frustrating.

284
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,356
l'm like a plug
without a socket, you know?

285
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,435
- Hey, Frank.
- What?

286
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,632
Did you ever do it in the Real World?

287
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,753
Ever think about
going back there so you can?

288
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,669
No. No way.

289
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,874
Baby, you and me,
l can't have that in the Real World.

290
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,719
l can't live without you.

291
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,113
But l can't be with you, you know.

292
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,549
What do you do, huh?
What do you do?

293
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,390
Well, we're just going to
have to pretend, then, aren't we?

294
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,309
Hey, boss.

295
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,994
- Boss!
- l heard you, Nails.

296
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,359
Oh, my God! l wouldn't do it!

297
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,508
Oh, phew!

298
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,828
- Boss, did l ever tell you about...?
- Shut up.

299
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,594
J<i>ack.</i>

300
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,195
<i>Come home, baby.</i>

301
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,753
No, no, no.

302
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,436
Glad you dropped in.

303
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,833
Here we are. Holli's humble abode.

304
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,600
Do you think she'll let us in?

305
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,518
Forget it.
This party is by invitation only.

306
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,837
This door has got an attitude.

307
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,714
- How much further?
- l'd say we're halfway up.

308
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,388
- Or halfway down.
- Right.

309
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,229
God, l hate heights.

310
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,590
Nails, this is no time to catch a cold.

311
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,190
lt's not a cold, boss.
l'm allergic to clouds.

312
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,312
You what?

313
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,829
Boss.

314
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,159
Don't even think about it.

315
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,473
- That felt smashingly good.
- Yeah.

316
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,911
- Make sure no one gets out this door.
- Absolutement, boss.

317
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,991
- Hello, Harris. Welcome to the party.
- What a swell party it is.

318
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,553
Thanks for having me.

319
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,788
l should've known riff-raff like you would
be involved in this equation, Sparks.

320
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,120
What equation? l've discovered
that if you look for trouble, you find it.

321
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,677
- What's your problem?
- Bad childhood. Where's the noid?

322
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,474
You're the only noid here, Harris.

323
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,193
Last warning.

324
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,520
You stay away from the noid or you're
closed for business permanently.

325
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,156
Have a splendid evening.

326
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,275
Want to know what it is about you
that really kicks my ass?

327
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,436
How about my foot?

328
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,796
You prance around
like you're some big deal.

329
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,278
You could cross over to the Real World,
but you haven't the guts.

330
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,679
You don't have what it takes to be real.
That makes you a wimp.

331
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,716
You may be right, Slick.

332
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,274
Be content with the cards
you've been dealt.

333
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,552
- What's the deal?
- lt's getting serious, Nails.

334
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,595
- We gotta find Jack Deebs.
- Right.

335
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,990
- Go for it, Jack.
- You better have an appointment.

336
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,957
- Go on, Jack.
- He does, but you don't.

337
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,515
But Holli said we could watch.

338
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,558
- Watch what?
- Go on up.

339
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,199
Go on up. Go on.

340
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,676
Bring me a souvenir, Jack.

341
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,268
Hey, Jack.

342
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,153
l've been waiting for you.

343
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,229
You like looking at me, Jack, don't you?

344
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,878
A man is in the bedroom.

345
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,912
Run, girls, run!

346
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,672
- OK, you listen to me, Holli.
- What?

347
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:20,035
That cop, Harris, said we can't go any
further than this, Holli.

348
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,071
l'm so hot for you.

349
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,272
- Are you going to follow the rules?
- No.

350
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,870
- Or your instincts?
- Yeah.

351
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,949
- But Holli said we could watch.
- l'll be right back.

352
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,074
- Was it good for you?
- lt wasn't what l expected.

353
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,198
Are you going to go in there
and make it up to Lonette?

354
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,236
Yeah, why not? Fact is, she's the best
thing that ever happened to me.

355
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,434
l could put overtime in on Deebs, boss.
l'm tireless.

356
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,552
Forget it. The Goons can't touch him

357
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,719
and we'd just run ourselves ragged
giving him the shadow.

358
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,549
- What should l do?
- Keep pumping our informants.

359
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,832
Somebody might lD him.
lf that happens, call me.

360
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,749
Call me here or Lonette's or my place.
l don't know.

361
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,080
- Don't make a move without me, OK?
- l got it, boss.

362
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,112
Hey, Lonette, where's my drink, babe?

363
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,835
l live to serve you.
l heard you the first ten times.

364
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,158
l'm sorry. Get a little closer.
Give us a kiss.

365
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,875
- Say it, don't spray it.
- Go away.

366
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,389
l'm outta here.

367
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,039
- Tough night?
- The usual.

368
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,196
Yeah.

369
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,317
Why do you want to hang around here?
This place should be erased.

370
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,479
lt's a living.
Even a doodle's gotta eat.

371
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,673
Why don't you put that arm around me?
lt's been a tough day.

372
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,959
Listen, you sludgehog excuse for a cop.

373
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,116
D<i>eebs and HoIIi</i> j<i>ust made it.</i>

374
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,949
<i>They're about to make an</i>
<i>unscheduIed trip to the other side.</i>

375
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,711
Holli! There's no end of trouble
a little minx like her can make.

376
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,230
She might damage the entire
inter-world matrix.

377
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,671
l don't give a doodle.
Just bust her ass.

378
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,908
Better call Frank. Better call Frank.

379
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,036
l just can't take it any more.

380
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,351
Where's Frank? Frank Harris.
Looking for Frank.

381
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,873
Where is he?

382
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,116
- Thank God.
- OK.

383
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,793
- Yeah, what is it?
- Having a good time, boss?

384
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,314
- l guess. Were you having a good time?
- Nails, leave us alone.

385
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,751
<i>Oh, I</i> j<i>ust Iove your ears.</i>

386
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,236
OK, Nails, what's the problem?

387
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,512
No trouble.
Nothing l can't handle myself.

388
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,157
- l was just checking in.
- Yeah, you sure?

389
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,954
All right. OK, Nails.

390
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,119
lt's incredible.

391
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,559
Wait a minute here.
What am l nervous for?

392
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,830
l could do this job myself.

393
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,797
Holli, why do we have to go back?
lt's so great here.

394
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,790
Oh, Jack. We're noids.

395
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,599
And noids just can't do doodle here.
l want to do it all, Jack.

396
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:19,751
And together we'll be unstoppable.
But you know something l've got to do?

397
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,428
l've got to tell the boys goodbye.

398
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,996
- They'll be lost without me.
- l understand.

399
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,476
- l know.
- l miss you already.

400
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,559
- l know. l'll be back. Bye.
- Be back soon.

401
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,471
Why the hell did you do it?
Are those curtains you're wearing?

402
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,390
You look horrendous, horrible,
like a high-school hippy. Peace, man.

403
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,070
That's right, boys. l made it.

404
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,717
Halt! Halt, in the name of the law!

405
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,876
Halt, l say.

406
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:06,797
Howdy, Nails. As you see, there've
been some changes around here.

407
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,673
You are a biomorphic menace.

408
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,078
l forbid you to take
one step out of the Cool World.

409
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,230
You eight-armed ink spot. Who do you
think you're dealing with? l'm real.

410
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:28,151
You made it with a noid. You don't know
what you are. Mark my words.

411
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,114
You leave here
and it is trouble for you two.

412
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,199
l'm leaving, pencil dick.
Just try and stop me.

413
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,754
Don't do it. Don't do it, girl.

414
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,437
That's so beautiful. That's so bad.
That's gotta hurt. A pen job!

415
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,315
Oh, pen me, too. Pen me, pen me.

416
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,116
Oh, hit me. Hit me.
Hit me again. Hit me.

417
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,633
Jack, time to go. Get us out of here.
We gotta get out of here.

418
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,796
Hold on tight.

419
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,999
Oh, Jack, l really like it here.

420
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,117
l think l'll go change.

421
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,275
Mom, he may be in trouble.
We've gotta help him.

422
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,156
- lt's none of our business.
- lt is. He's our neighbour.

423
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,235
l love her.

424
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,034
Hello.

425
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,758
This is me. lt's me.

426
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:28,277
lsabelle and Jennifer Malley,
this is Holli...my friend.

427
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,313
This is Jack.

428
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,433
Holli is from out of town.

429
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,475
Well, we didn't mean to bother you,
it's just...

430
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,356
- We were scared you might be hurt.
- No, no. Thanks for asking.

431
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,950
Well, thanks.
lt's good to have nice neighbours.

432
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,072
Nice neighbours. l'm real.

433
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,874
Yeah, you sure are, honey.

434
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,789
- l'm real.
- Bye.

435
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,709
- She was a cheap piece of work.
- l thought she was pretty.

436
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,912
l've got this feeling
l know her from somewhere.

437
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,798
He looks full of life to me,
for goodness' sakes.

438
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,110
What happened, ink stain?

439
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,074
He had a run-in with a noid,
then he got inked.

440
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,558
- That damned Deebs.
- lt was Holli Would.

441
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,990
- Holli is a doodle.
- Not any more.

442
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,476
She's made it with that Deebs asshole.
She's changed.

443
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,831
Now buy me more fries, dickhead.

444
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,870
This is gonna be the biggest shit storm
the Cool World has ever seen.

445
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,117
So many men. And they're real!

446
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,311
- Smell them.
- Holli, you're with me, remember?

447
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,991
- You can't go around smelling people.
- Yeah, Jack.

448
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,719
- What do you want to drink?
- Anything they have.

449
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,276
They've got 95 different things, Holli.

450
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,071
95? l'll have one of each.

451
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,276
Holli, you know, l'm into having fun,
but you've got to slow down, OK?

452
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,998
Why would l slow down? l'm gonna
get everything l ever wanted.

453
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,273
You think any of these men
are going to say no to Holli?

454
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,156
Not on your life, pal.
Gentlemen prefer blondes.

455
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,432
Thank you. Glad you enjoyed that
wonderful old standard.

456
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,950
- L<i>et's Make</i> L<i>ove.</i>
- Hey, she's with me.

457
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,151
No, she's with us.

458
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,313
And stay out.

459
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,313
- Hit it.
- Brian, please.

460
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,079
<i>Here we sit and we chatter</i>

461
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,068
<i>|What are we thinking of?</i>

462
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,512
L<i>et's not make with the patter</i>

01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,794
<i>Baby, Iet's make Iove</i>

464
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,992
<i>Oh, my, but it's stifIing</i>

465
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,193
<i>If you roar Iike a Iion</i>

01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,439

<i>Baby, Iet's make Iove</i>

469
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,559
<i>No, don't turn TV on</i>

01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,878
<i>Instead</i> j<i>ust turn me on</i>

471
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,915
<i>I Iight up Iike neon...</i>

472
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:13,672
When your partner gets inked,
you do something about it.

473
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,632
l'm not buying it.

474
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,718
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

475
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,311
Can't you think about me for a minute?
Where does this leave me?

476
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,397
What are you mad about?

477
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,991
Because you talk about crossing
and don't care how it makes me feel.

478
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,191
How do you feel?

479
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,235
- Left out!
- You think l want to go back there?

480
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,477
Why wouldn't you?
That's real to you, isn't it?

481
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,037
Let me tell you something
about over there. lt hurts. lt's lonely.

482
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:50,234
lt's a war over there. They got 8 million
ways to die and they're all permanent.

483
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,070
This, with you, is real for me. lf l want
to stay with you, l gotta go back.

484
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,229
Because if they're after what l think,
there won't be any here or there.

485
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,829
Understand? No more here.

486
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:07,033
- Just go ahead.
- Hey, hey...

487
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,435
l'm coming back.

488
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,554
- What's going on?
- Something's very, very wrong.

489
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,672
No shit, pal. So, what is it?

490
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:04,549
l'm up there, and l was just moving
and shaking with the best of them,

491
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,311
and, all of a sudden,
l went doodle again.

492
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,349
- <i>|Watch this, Ma, no hands!</i>
- <i>No, don't!</i>

493
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,996
<i>I wouIdn't do that, come on.</i>

494
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,868
Good luck, Frank.

495
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,950
Please just let me think. Let me think.

496
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,756
Cool, Jack. Really cool.

497
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,398
l guess it's tough, driving and thinking
at the same time, huh?

498
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,116
- The Spike of Power.
- The what?

499
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,352
The Spike could heal me.

500
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,314
Vegas Vinnie put the Spike
at the top of the casino.

501
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,432
You're nuts. You are nuts!

502
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:06,350
Don't say l'm nuts. l've had enough
ego out of you, pal.

503
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,028
And you used to think you made me up.

504
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,913
There is no Spike of Power.

505
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,114
There's gotta be.
And l'm going to find it right now.

506
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:21,598
- No, you're not. OK? Yeah.
- We're going there.

507
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:26,635
- We're not.
- You're a nice fella. Don't piss me off.

508
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,038
Oh, yeah?
What are you going to do about it, Holli?

509
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,195
Goddamn it!

510
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,514
Take it easy.

511
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:14,389
- What are you doing here, Harris?
- l'm taking you and the bimbo back.

512
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,835
Are you going to shoot me?
Shoot me, goddamn it!

513
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,276
- Shoot me, Harris.
- Don't push me.

514
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,679
You couldn't take a piece of good advice.
You had to listen to your Johnson.

515
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,236
l've had it with you, goddamn it!

516
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,194
You've had it with me,
you piece of shit?!

517
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:42,349
You screw us all for a piece of ass and
you've had it with me? Where is she?

518
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,036
lt's happening, Jack.

519
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:57,273
l've got news for you, Harris.
lt's happening to her, too.

520
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,870
Jack, l saw it this time. l swear.
l saw this thing hit your house again.

521
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,914
- Remember when we came over?
- All right, Jack.

522
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,430
- Another friend from out of town?
- Yeah.

523
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:19,590
- What happened to your suit?
- What's going on with us is complex.

524
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,030
l'll explain some other time.

525
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,710
We got no more time.
Where do we find Holli?

526
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,516
- She went to the Union Plaza.
- The Spike.

527
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,555
She went to meet this guy Vegas Vinnie.
Problem is, she took my car.

528
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,069
l've got my mom's car.

529
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,876
Let's go. We're trying to protect
the balance of the entire universe.

530
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,958
My mom won't chuck a fit,
then if we took it.

531
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,389
Miss?

532
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,192
Can l help you?

533
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,749
- l'm looking for Vegas Vinnie.
- There's no Vegas Vinnie here.

534
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:32,115
- He owns the place.
- l'm sorry, l can't help you.

535
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,231
- Do you know Vegas Vinnie?
- No, sorry.

536
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,078
Vegas Vinnie?

537
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,199
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

538
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,350
Vegas Vinnie is a story
based on a real guy, this doc l met

539
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,269
when l first went across 50 years ago.

540
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,756
Cool World's real? Neat!

541
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,272
He and l mapped out the tunnel,
the passageway between both worlds.

542
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:33,238
And we saw how easily one could disrupt
that balance and destroy both universes.

543
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,396
Destroy the universe?

544
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,752
Get out.

545
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:50,117
When you have some money, we'd love
to see you. Until then, keep out.

546
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:14,519
- Pretty looking sign, huh, miss?
- Yeah. That spike in the centre.

547
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,756
lt's real bright.

548
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,999
You sound kind of down, miss.
Had bad luck at the tables?

549
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,192
Let's just say it ain't been my day.

550
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,197
Oh, well, don't worry.

551
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,309
Good Lord,
l never thought l'd see it happen.

552
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,229
What you're looking for,
you can't find around here.

553
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:41,958
- You better go.
- How do you know what l'm looking for?

554
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,630
You do know what l am, don't you?

555
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,274
You know where l'm from.

556
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,276
Oh, my goodness!

557
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:10,190
Old man, l'm not leaving until l find out
how you know so much.

558
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,439
Talk. You're not telling me
everything you know.

559
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,837
You're...

560
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,549
You're a doodle!

561
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,629
ln Cool World, they knew me as
Whiskers. Doctor Vincent Whiskers.

562
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,630
- Didn't you touch the Spike?
- Sure l touched it. But l couldn't hold it.

563
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,355
- No one can.
- So it is up there!

564
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,472
lt is real
and it's gonna make me real.

565
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,517
Sure it's up there,
but it's not gonna do you any good.

566
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,358
You weren't man enough to hold onto it.

567
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,031
l need the force in that spike.
And l'm going up there.

568
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,831
That power doesn't belong to you.

569
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:11,716
l don't care. l want it. l don't care.

570
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,629
- Stop. Cease. Desist.
- l mean it.

571
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,832
Make it easy on yourself!

572
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,713
- There she is.
- She looks pretty.

573
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,391
Come on, you little troublemaker.
Nobody's going to stop me now.

574
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,717
Harris, help me.
You've gotta stop that girl.

575
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,277
lf she moves it,
it could be the end of everything.

576
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,950
- Doc?
- Wait, wait. Jack, wait.

577
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:45,312
- l need you to take care of my friend.
- l've got to stop her.

578
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,789
- Wait, Jack. l'm not going to hurt her.
- Let me go.

579
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,673
Help him.

580
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,954
Crazy doodle bitch!

581
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,397
Hello, Holli. Guess what?
You're through.

582
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,910
You know, sweetheart,
you look good in the flesh.

583
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,955
lt's almost a shame l gotta take
you back. You are going back.

584
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,153
Would!

585
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:06,428
- You're squeezing my head.
- There. As good as new.

586
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:16,195
Where are you going? lt's over.
You're gonna jump? Just get down!

587
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,950
For Christ's sake.
You got ink for brains? Get down!

588
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:27,794
Don't piss me off, Would.
You go on that roof, you screw us all.

589
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,357
l'm not messing around.
There's nothing up there.

590
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,358
Let's go home and fix this mess.

591
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,713
Get down.

592
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,629
Would.

593
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,270
- Don't... Harris?
- What?

594
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,631
Harris, help me.

595
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,074
Help me.

596
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,395
- Harris, help me.
- Hold on.

597
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:15,628
l should do the world a favour
and let you fall.

598
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,276
Easy. Easy does it. Good.

599
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:25,635
Now, hold on.
Here we go. We're going home.

600
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,072
All right, careful. Come on.

601
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,990
Oh, my God.

602
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,791
Jack, this is your chance
to make it right. lt's up to you now.

603
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,838
OK. OK. This time
l'm gonna do something right.

604
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,150
He's going to kill himself.

605
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,911
He's fulfilling his destiny.
He's becoming a hero.

606
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,800
Oh, please!

607
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:23,395
The Spike!
lt's up to me to return the Spike!

608
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,916
Got it!

609
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,594
The pain is unbearable.

610
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,279
Hit me.

611
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,596
The world has only one chance left.

612
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,839
lt's up to me to return the Spike
and plug the hole.

613
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,793
- Ha, you fiends!
- Not so fast.

614
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,356
Trying to stop me.

615
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,315
Oh, l hate being bottled up like that.

616
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,229
Oh, man, boss, hold on! Hold on!

617
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:54,119
Feel the air, Jack. We're staying.
l like it here, Jack.

618
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:01,075
Come here. Give me the Spike, Jack.

619
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,669
You love me, don't you, Jack?

620
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,111
Yes, l do.

621
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:15,195
Well, then, help me.
Give it to me, Jack.

622
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,679
OK, honey-poo.

623
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,597
- Goody, goody, goody.
- Pencil dicks.

624
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,677
Aha! A trick.

625
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,954
On second thoughts, l must do
what is right and return the Spike.

626
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,914
He's gone.

627
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,398
He's gone.

628
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:39,310
Dead? l don't know for sure,
but l don't think so.

629
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:45,516
Maybe the Spike protected them.
lts power is beyond our understanding.

630
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:59,033
- Sorry he didn't make it.
- l gotta take him back with me.

631
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:05,952
There's a nice girl back there.
She deserves to see him, dead or alive.

632
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:09,391
OK, Doc. Let her rip.

633
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,674
Wow!

634
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,432
Oh, Nails!

635
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,996
He didn't make it. l'm sorry.

636
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:15,752
Oh, Frank, honey, no, please!
You can't leave me.

637
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:23,199
- Oh, no! Who killed him, Nails?
- He was pushed off a building.

638
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,233
- Who pushed him?
- Holli Would.

639
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,955
Holli Would? That bitch!

640
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,229
Nails, was she a doodle
when she aced him?

641
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,716
- Yeah, so what?
- So what?

642
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,793
What happens to noids
who traffic in the Cool World?

643
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,357
When they get killed by a doodle,
they become a doodle themselves.

644
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:58,508
Hot dog! Dig it! Dig me!

645
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,316
Oh, my God! Oh, Nails, he's alive!

646
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:11,038
- And he's gorgeous, too.
- Baby, what do you think?

647
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,232
You're a hero, Harris.
You saved the world.

648
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:18,353
So, what are you waiting for?
Come and get it.

649
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,833
Oh, Frankie.

650
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,238
So, did you do it while
you were in the Real World?

651
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:33,594
Did you do it? Ever think about
going back there so you can?

652
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,553
There's no reason now.

653
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,796
Hey, boss, we gotta go.

654
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:46,319
