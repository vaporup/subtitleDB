Where's the remote?
Is the remote over there?

00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,586
What the Hell?

5
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,661
Are you fucking kidding me?

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Are you fucking kidding me?

7
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,955
<i>I've got plenty of information...</i>

8
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,035
It's not here.

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,296
<i>...I know on our launch day...</i>

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,353
Where is it?

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,718
<i>...Which is our biggest sales day...</i>

12
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,595
What the FUCK is that!?!

13
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:08,733
...that...

14
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,700
<i>...we're not even featured anywhere...</i>

15
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,795
<i>I know on our launch day,
at this point</i>

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,446
<i>We're going to do worse than
all of them.</i>

17
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:26,105
Indie Game: The Movie

18
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:32,548
<i>Part of it...</i>

19
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,300
<i>...is about not trying to be...</i>

20
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,673
<i>...professional.</i>

21
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:39,540
<i>A lot of people come in
to indie games...</i>

22
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,640
<i>...trying to be like a big company.</i>

23
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:43,780
<i>What those companies do...</i>

24
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:45,780
...is create highly polished things...

25
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:50,190
<i>...that serve as large
of an audience as possible.</i>

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,193
<i>The way that you do that is by...</i>

27
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:55,591
<i>...filing off all the bumps
on something.</i>

28
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:56,948
<i>If there's a sharp corner,</i>

29
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,783
<i>you make sure it's not going to
hurt anybody.</i>

30
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,106
<i>If they bump into it or whatever.</i>

31
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:04,186
<i>That creation of this highly glossy,
commercial product</i>

32
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,331
<i>Is the opposite of
making something personal.</i>

33
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,710
I am determined to make video games...

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,055
...and I make video games
because I can.

35
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:12,951
I'm very, very good at programing.

36
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:16,793
I can still make something that
expresses myself.

37
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:19,475
Like a movie or something
that I wrote.

38
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,848
I can make that as a video game.

39
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,711
And I have the full ability
to do that.

40
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,791
<i>Things that are personal...</i>

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,353
<i>...have flaws.
They have vulnerabilities.</i>

42
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,481
To me, games
are the ultimate art form.

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,443
It's just the ultimate medium.

44
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,518
It's the sum total of every
expressive medium of all time...

45
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:38,770
...made interactive.

46
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,131
How is that not...

47
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,398
It's AWESOME!

48
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:42,298
I want to be part of it.

49
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:45,605
I want to have a say
in what becomes of video games.

50
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:48,363
<i>If you don't see a
vulnerability in somebody...</i>

51
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:51,585
<i>You're probably not relating with them
on a very personal level.</i>

52
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:54,428
<i>So it's the same with a game design.</i>

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,341
My whole career has been me,
trying to find new ways...

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,188
...to communicate with people.

55
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,215
Because, I desperately want to
communicate with people.

56
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:03,306
But I don't want the
messy interaction of having to...

57
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,931
...make friends and talk to people.

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,540
Because I probably don't like them.

59
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,936
When you make games.
And you put stuff up online.

60
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,271
And people like your stuff
or don't like your stuff.

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,768
Either way, they're going to give you
some kind of feedback.

62
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,568
And you have this conversation.

63
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:17,691
It's why a writer writes I guess.

64
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,036
Because they can.

65
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:21,156
It's the most effective way to
express themselves.

66
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:26,536
And a video game is the most
effective way I can express myself.

67
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:28,873
<i>Making it was about...</i>

68
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,278
<i>Let me take my deepest flaws
and vulnerabilities...</i>

69
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,625
<i>...and put them in the game.</i>

70
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:39,398
<i>And let's see what happens.</i>

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,600
The generation indie game
developers are coming from,

72
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:49,893
and I'm part of this generation also,

73
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:53,773
we're the first generation that
grew up with video games.

74
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,533
But not as
an active purchasing choice.

75
00:03:57,923 --> 00:04:00,060
Since I was part of
that generation...

76
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:01,865
I feel an ownership of it.

77
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:03,533
Games are mine.

78
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:08,161
For anyone that grew up
after 1975; 1980 or so...

79
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,850
...we were the first generation
to grow up with our parents

80
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:12,873
...giving us games.
And for us to grow up with games...

81
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,991
...as a natural, and relevant part of
our everyday existence.

82
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,880
This is not a
weird kid activity for me.

83
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,175
This is not like
some strange nerdy pastime.

84
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,278
This has been a part of my life.

85
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:24,345
There's been a tendency...

86
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,723
...over the past couple decades in
mainstream games...

87
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,471
...to make everything bigger
and more realistic.

88
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,848
To 'Amp Up'
everything.

89
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,253
[GUS]
Big games have other goals.

90
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:36,440
They want to entertain you.

91
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:40,816
They want to get 10 million people
playing at the same time.

92
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,901
But with Indie Games,
it's often 1 person

93
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:44,908
Who says:
I want a game to be like this.

94
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,828
I want a game to be about
this special thing.

95
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:52,398
Independent games are any game
that a small team...

96
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:55,708
...or individual worked on
to their own vision.

97
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,808
Something that they felt like making,
coding and finishing.

98
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,633
The major thing that made
this possible...

99
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,308
...is the rise of
digital distribution.

100
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:08,263
Retailers used to have
a lot of power...

101
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,543
...over every game creation company.

102
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,228
Because that was
the only way to sell games.

103
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,063
Nobody was willing to start
distributing games digitally.

104
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,358
Because WalMart would get upset
at them.

105
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,151
And take their products off the shelf.
And nothing would happen.

106
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:25,905
But Valve changed that,
when they came out with Steam.

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,636
They had no loyalties to retail.
So they just did it.

108
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:32,955
After that everyone else said:
'Well, we have to compete with them'

109
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,626
And there was this whole flood of:
XBox Live Arcade...

110
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,178
...Playstation network...

111
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:40,873
...and WiiWare followed suit.

112
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,543
2008 was the first year that
indie games started to do really well.

113
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,888
Audiosurf came out on Steam.

114
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:50,835
Then Castle Crashers...

115
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,931
...and Braid and World of Goo.

116
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:55,098
Osmos did really well in 2009, 2010.

117
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,731
Then Limbo came out and broke records.

118
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,010
And Minecraft came out as well-

119
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:06,261
Actually, it came out much earlier,
but then it really built up...

120
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,073
...and blew those records away.

121
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,448
And when we're talking about
'really well' ...

122
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:13,120
...we're talking about
millions of dollars in revenue.

123
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:16,833
So for teams of 200,
millions of dollars...

124
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,510
...doesn't really count for much.

125
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,755
But for a team of 2, 3 people...

126
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:24,168
... that's really significant money.

127
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,220

<i>...it is looking AMAZING!
I can not wait to see it done...</i>

142
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:04,713
We both
approached Super Meat Boy...

143
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,106
...where our goal was to
make a game...

144
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:12,001
...that our 13 yr. old selves would be
super fan boys of.

145
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:16,171
Super Meat Boy has been
in development for 11 months.

146
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:18,230
I know that
13 yr. old Edmund...

147
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,841
...would hear about Meat Boy
right now.

148
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,606
He'd be following us on Twitter.

149
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,966
He'd be that annoying kid
that was like...

150
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:26,978
<i>Hey, send me a build!
My name is 'Super Meat Boy Fan Boy'</i>

151
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,323
<i>I've registered it; I haven't even
played the game yet.</i>

152
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,730
<i>Get me a demo!?! Co'mon!!!</i>

153
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,578
I'd totally be that.
Because this game is very... me.

154
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,915
And Tommy would say the same.

155
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,373
I want it to be one of those games
that kids would...

156
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:46,000
...go crazy for on the school yard...

157
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:50,441
...and passionately argue that
'this game is better than this game'

158
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,735
This is my room...where I grew up.

159
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:09,465
As a child

160
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:15,868
Yeah, forever this has been my room.

161
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,243
I have a bunch of posters from
'Nintendo Power'

162
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,540
Way back in the day.

163
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:24,085
Yeah, this room IS my childhood.

164
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:26,838
And that's basically
what Super Meat Boy is.

165
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,715
It's my and Edmund's childhood,
put into game form...

166
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:34,320
By ... seemingly ... adult males.

167
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,976
Super Meat Boy is an upcoming
PC and console game...

168
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,453
... based on a Flash game.

169
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:47,316
This incredibly hard Flash game that
was super super popular.

170
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,780
It's a game that looks like it's going
to be traditional in a way.

171
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,423
It's a 'Platformer'
This very well know thing.

172
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,196
But it's got a real distinct art style

173
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,866
And a very quirky
point of view.

174
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:04,611
Super Meat Boy is a retro Platformer.

175
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:07,610
Where you play as a boy with no skin.

176
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:09,866
Who's just Meat, basically.

177
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:13,550
He's trying to rescue his girlfriend,
who is made of bandages...

178
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:17,410
From an evil doctor,
that's a fetus in a jar...

179
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:20,760
... wearing a top hat and a monocle.
Dressed in a tuxedo.

180
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:27,400
During my early years.
Going through school and everything...

181
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,193
It was all 'Mega Man', 'Mario'
and 'Metroid'

182
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,276
Older, very very difficult games.

183
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,061
Every game on this wall...

184
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:38,071
... 'F Zero' was hard ...

185
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,521
... 'Mega Man' was very difficult.
'Spy Hunter' was stupidly difficult.

186
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:46,751
In Super Meat Boy,
we get to do whatever we want.

187
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,166
We don't have a publisher.
Or investors.

188
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,400
We don't answer to anybody.

189
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,693
A lot of that is shown in the game.
We get away with a lot of stuff.

190
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:58,011
We can have Dr. Fetus
give the middle finger.

191
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,641
Because he only has 3 fingers. So it's
not technically his middle finger.

192
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:05,018
We can put in any sort of humor
or parody that we want.

193
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:09,751
We have parodies of 'Street Fighter'
and 'Castlevania'...

194
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:13,923
... 'Mega Man' intros
... 'Bubble Bobble'

195
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,181
'Super Meat Boy' will release
on Xbox in 7 months.

196
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:21,118
People want to know:
Is this game going to be substantial?

197
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,235
Or is it just all the quirk
and character?

198
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:27,695
A lot of people think it's
going to be ...

199
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:31,706
... along the lines of Castle Crashers

200
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,526
In 2008, 'Castle Crashers' and 'Braid'
were the 2 games that...

201
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:39,470
... really made people look at go:
'Oh, I can download games on my Xbox.'

202
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:44,940
People are expecting this game to be
the next big thing on 'XBLA'.

203
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,600
As long as it comes out
and does something ...

204
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,631
Even if it made me $ 20,000
over the next 2 years or something...

205
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,973
That would be enough
to make the next game.

206
00:10:56,143 --> 00:10:58,136
Based on
what I'm living off right now.

207
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:01,491
And I'd have to do that, because...

208
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,830
I'm not going
to go work at 'EA' or 'Epic'.

209
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:09,433
That sounds horrible.
That sounds like Hell to me.

210
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,480
So, if it comes out
and people don't like it.

211
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,296
And people hate it.

212
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,973
And it has a Metacritic score
of, like, 20.

213
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,526
And everyone thinks its awful...

214
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,678
It doesn't make a difference
because ...

215
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:27,101
Even though it's a game
that people are supposed to buy ...

216
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,688
... it's not a game
that I made 'for people'.

217
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,428
I made it for myself.

218
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:35,400
Ed and I made it as a reflection
of ourselves.

219
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:40,310
And we tried to make it as fun
and as accessible as possible.

220
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:45,203
Whatever. If people want
'Modern Warfare' or 'Halo Reach'...

221
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,163
...that's fine because I think
those games are shit.

222
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,175
If that's what people want.
Then they don't want my games.

223
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:54,025
Because I don't make shit games.

224
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,175
If you follow Indie Games...

225
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,886
... even remotely ...

226
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,300
'FEZ' is one of the projects that
you've been hearing about for a while.

227
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:09,673
It's been several years in development

228
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:13,021
FEZ has been in development
for the past 3 years.

229
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,651
FEZ will be memorable for
it's release ....

230
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:19,653
... or for never coming out.

231
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:22,490
<i>And the winner is...</i>

232
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,700
<i>FEZ!</i>

233
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:28,830
So FEZ wins an award at the IGF...

234
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:33,543
It was hardly finished.
It won on the back of small tech demo.

235
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,938
<i>In the clear blue sky ...</i>

236
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,961
<i>... an awards ceremony ...</i>

237
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,301
Within a week, I saw it on
EVERY major gaming website.

238
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,715
<i>My name is Phil.
I'm an independent game developer.</i>

239
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:51,351
<i>It's mostly about this little 2D guy.
Who lives in a 2D world.</i>

240
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,855
<i>And then one day realizes that
the world is 3D.</i>

241
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,323
All of a sudden, Phil,
who is making this game on his own...

242
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:00,016
... with a grant from
the Canadian government.

243
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,736
Is some Indie Gaming Rock-star.

244
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,860
<i>This is fucking awesome.</i>

245
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,978
Phil is trying to walk around
in a Cubist painting.

246
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:12,415
That's what FEZ is ...

247
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:15,093
... you're walking around
a cubist painting.

248
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,065
2D characters in a 3D rotating world.

249
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,913
At any point, you're only
seeing one side of the world.

250
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,550
And everybody is clamoring.
They want to see the game.

251
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:31,703
"When do we get the game..."
"When can we play the game..."

252
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:35,735
There's been so much speculation about
When? Where? ... How?

253
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:38,011
If EVER this game is going to come out

254
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,113
<i>FINISH THE GOD DAMN GAME!</i>

255
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:46,615
I'm working on it.

256
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,623
As hard as I can.
All the time.

257
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,193
<i>"What's taking so long"
"What the fuck are you doing Phil?"</i>

258
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:55,946
I'm doing the best I can here!

259
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:59,483
I don't hear people bitch about
Valve taking-

260
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:02,170
Well, no, they do bitch about Valve
and Episode 3.

261
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,768
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS FEZ!!

262
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,481
And there's hundreds of people
working there!

263
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:08,251
ICO took five years...

264
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:11,276
Red Dead Redemption:
A thousand people. Five years.

265
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:13,248
GTA4:
A thousand people. Five years.

266
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,603
Nobody bitches about that-
A THOUSAND PEOPLE!!

267
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,063
There's two of us here

268
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,201
<i>"It's taking too long"</i>

269
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:20,401
FUCK OFF!

270
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:22,485
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!
Like...

271
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:24,695
It really gets to me.

272
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,978
I guess, that's the price you pay
for being indie.

273
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:33,705
And being the one guy that
people know is making the game.

274
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,720
You open yourself up to
these kinds of personal attacks.

275
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,690
That I wasn't ... uh ...

276
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:45,175
That's not something I was expecting,
when dreaming about being independent.

277
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:48,970
Not this Army of Assholes online ...

278
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,325
... to, not ruin my life,
but to make it that more ...

279
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,505
...hard to enjoy.

280
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:07,530
It's a complicated game also.

281
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,938
It was ridiculously over ambitious.

282
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,953
For my first indie game.

283
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,580
It's a classic mistake.

284
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,868
And we didn't realize
we were making it.

285
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:21,001
We thought it was going to take a year

286
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,645
We thought it was going to be
a simple game.

287
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:27,053
And it became a completely
different game many times.

288
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:33,035
<i>[Phil & Renaud converse in French]</i>

289
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,401
My name is Renaud.

290
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,020
I've been programming FEZ
since the beginning.

291
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:46,695
Since three years ago.

292
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,448
Day to day, it's just coding stuff.
Adding features. Fixing bugs.

293
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:51,771
That's what I do.

294
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,361
There's a lot of
personal pressure to ...

295
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,780
... finish what you've been working on
for so long.

296
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,125
And there's a lot of people
expecting it to be really awesome.

297
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:01,668
And much bigger than we've shown.

298
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,420
Because, every time we show something.
We say: 'oh that's nothing'.

299
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,130
'that's just a small part'

300
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,741
'you'll see how much better it gets'

301
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:11,541
The personal pressure is bigger to me
than the outside world pressure.

302
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:14,763
I really need to get this done.

303
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,393
It's a learning experience

304
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:23,923
I've made games before. But I've never
produced an entire game from A to Z.

305
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,223
For commercial release
On a real platform.

306
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:30,905
With Microsoft.
I've never done that before.

307
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,248
It's terrifying.

308
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:35,970
It's really really really scary.

309
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,871
Especially when you lose funding.
Or something like that ...

310
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,215
There's just no safety net there.

311
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,225
There's nothing to fall back on.

312
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:49,203
There's always the threat of
everything falling apart.

313
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,880
Any day now.

314
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:55,596
FEZ is now scheduled
to release in 2011

315
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,058
13 months left.

316
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:20,121
It was very difficult to make the game

317
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,291
But in some ways,
it was less difficult...

318
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:26,968
... than what I had
been doing until then.

319
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:31,663
Having a lot of big ideas about
what I wanted to do in games.

320
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,708
And not finishing anything that had
the impact I wanted to have.

321
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:38,746
[Jonathan has been making
games for 22 years]

322
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,560
I think as one ages
and establishes a pattern of that.

323
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,396
It becomes a little bit demoralizing.

324
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,690
You start to look at things and say:

325
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,891
"Maybe I'm never going to do the
things I thought I would."

326
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:56,236
Then one day, I said: I'm going to
actually finish something.

327
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,410
And that became 'Braid'.

328
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,870
It took three years, but I finished it

329
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,208
One of the biggest breakout
games would have to be Braid.

330
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,670
Braid is an interesting game ...

331
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:11,981
... I was surprised it was as
successful as it is.

332
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,915
It was a big hit for
the independent community.

333
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,965
Generating a lot of money for
Jonathan.

334
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:20,758
It's a very odd setting and a lot of
people aren't quite sure what it means

335
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,901
Nobody had played a game that was like
Braid.

336
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,611
That did what Braid did
with time before.

337
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,068
Really what made Braid work was that
'Rewind' mechanic ...

338
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:37,615
... obviously, from a gameplay
perspective was a lot of fun.

339
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:41,301
But it also had a metaphorical
relevance as well.

340
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,778
It's telling this strange,
out of order love story

341
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,958
... not something you normally see
in a game.

342
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,608
It's about this little preppy boy.

343
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,626
He always looks like a preppy to me.

344
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,356
He's lost something and is working
through memories ...

345
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:57,188
... that change as he keeps playing.

346
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:01,091
The fictional world
and the game world mechanic ...

347
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,255
... those two work hand-in-hand
very very well.

348
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,940
So Braid came out of the confluence
of a couple of different ideas.

349
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:15,348
I was on a mailing list with
some friends. And one friend...

350
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:18,990
... was looking at
'Prince of Persia: Sands of Time'

351
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,370
And it had this ability to 'rewind'.

352
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,456
But it was limited.
You had a certain number of charges.

353
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:32,378
When you ran out, if you got
killed, you couldn't rewind anymore.

354
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:37,055
You had to reload the game.
Which was this painful process.

355
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:40,901
So one of my friends said:
Why not do it like a VCR?

356
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:42,930
And rewind anytime you want.

357
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,945
But nobody ever tried it.

358
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,101
So I said:
'Okay, I'm feeling inspired.'

359
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,141
'Let me start this idea for this game
I've been kicking around.'

360
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:53,383
And I spent about a week working on it

361
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:56,653
And I had a prototype.

362
00:19:56,823 --> 00:20:00,886
That is really kind of amazing.
In that...

363
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,571
... if you look at the prototype,
and the final game ...

364
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:07,246
... a lot of the ideas from
the final game and in that prototype.

365
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:10,155
So I had the first three worlds.

366
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:12,833
I mean not fully built out worlds.

367
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,386
But the game mechanics were there.
For rewinding ...

368
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:18,396
And for rewinding with things that are
immune to rewind.

369
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,885
And for time and space
being tied together.

370
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:23,370
So that time changes as you move.

371
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,598
I had a number of puzzles.

372
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:31,536
Probably half of them are in
the final game, in recognizable form.

373
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,815
It was very low effort, on my part,

374
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,693
to do something very interesting
in the system.

375
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,235
And I was like: 'Wow'

376
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,821
It started as experimentation.

377
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,325
but then it quickly became
a process of discovery.

378
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:46,703
It's like sitting on a gold mine.

379
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,636
But you don't even have to dig.

380
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:52,236
You just scoop some dirt and
there's a little chunk of gold.

381
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:55,333
Then you scoop a little more ...

382
00:20:55,501 --> 00:21:00,840
The hardest part of the process is
picking up these heavy chunks of gold.

383
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,303
So that was
an amazing design experience.

384
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:10,993
[Braid is one of the top rated
video games of all time.]

385
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:28,786
Most of the time, Tommy's
in North Carolina. Working remotely.

386
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,650
And I'm here working from my computer.

387
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,801
The way this game developed...

388
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:38,710
... has been very different from
other games I've worked on.

389
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,183
[Edmund has designed
25 Flash games in the past 10 years.]

390
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,718
[Super Meat Boy will be
his first major release.]

391
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,596
We bounce ideas off each other.
Not just gameplay ideas.

392
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:52,268
More like jokes.
Jokes that get out of control ...

393
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,765
... and push their way into the game.

394
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:57,106
It says:
'Code. Code. Code. Durrrrr!'

395
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,650
My Adams's Apple is not that big!
Stop it!

396
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,361
What if I put a knife in it ...

397
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,510
... look at that.
It's totally injected all the way in.

398
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:08,713
See the needle? And then a hammer hits
the needle in deeper.

399
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:12,943
I've always been trying to
find where boundaries are.

400
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:16,863
And see how far I can push them
before I get in trouble.

401
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:20,005
That's what I'm doing now.

402
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,840
If I'm not doing that, I'm bored.

403
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,843
And if I'm bored.
I'm not being creative.

404
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:33,266
I make games that center around my
life. The things I think, say and do.

405
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,878
I make games to express myself.
I guess.

406
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,513
It's hard for me to talk about
Santa Cruz.

407
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:45,373
I never lived anywhere else.
It's just 'normal'.

408
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:46,906
I grew up here.

409
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,916
My mom was obsessed with the beach.

410
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:51,325
It was always her dream to live in
Santa Cruz.

411
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,435
So, that's where she ...

412
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,455
... forced us to live.

413
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:59,180
It was like a skate and surf town.

414
00:22:59,348 --> 00:23:01,170
I never got into either.

415
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,193
I stayed in the house,
played video games and drew.

416
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:07,508
Monsters.

417
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,526
I only drew monsters.

418
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:11,436
I drew weird shit.

419
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:15,370
There's a drawing of a kid,
with a demon inside of him.

420
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,978
Scratching to get out.

421
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,858
In third grade, my teacher
recommended that I be evaluated.

422
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:23,470
Psychologically evaluated.

423
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,878
She thought I was
mentally disturbed.

424
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:28,906
My mom said: 'No, he's just an artist.
He like's to draw.'

425
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,905
And she said: 'That's not art.
That's a cry for help.'

426
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:41,680
I basically grew up with my Grandma.

427
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,630
I didn't get along with my Step Dad.

428
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,311
When there was a problem,
I would stay with my Grandma.

429
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:49,550
Or we would all stay with my Grandma.

430
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,710
My Grandma was extremely supportive.

431
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,600
To the point of annoying my mom
and my sister.

432
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,646
To her, I was the Golden Boy
who could do anything.

433
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:03,273
She made me feel like
I could do anything.

434
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,560
When she said:
'You're going to be a success'

435
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:12,086
It wasn't like she was just saying it.
It was like, a FACT.

436
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:16,430
Like, that was going to happen.
That was that.

437
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:20,051
Aether was based on my niece.

438
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:22,335
She reminded me of myself.

439
00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:25,045
She didn't like
playing with other kids.

440
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,388
She liked to do things by herself.
And explore by herself.

441
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:32,336
She was very imaginative.
And she really liked monsters

442
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:34,721
So, that brought me back to
when I was little. And I thought...

443
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,763
How cool would it be to make a game.

444
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:43,315
That could put people inside my mind
when I was 5, 6, 7?

445
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:47,673
And that became 'Aether'

446
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:50,818
So this kid gets on
the back of a monster.

447
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,990
And the monster goes around in space.

448
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,335
And he explores all
these other planets.

449
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:58,488
He can't connect to anybody
on earth. So he goes to find friends.

450
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:01,916
But all these other planets are
inhabited by...

451
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:06,085
... weird or sad or nervous creatures.

452
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,881
And he tries to solve their problems.
And succeeds...

453
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,926
But they don't become happy.

454
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,218
And he keeps going around
all these planets.

455
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,755
But each time he solves a problem,
the Earth gets smaller.

456
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:22,131
When he comes back. It's so
small that when he touches it...

457
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:23,186
...it breaks.

458
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,106
And he's lost in space.

459
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,600
It was about the idea of...

460
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,268
It's really cool to be a creative kid.

461
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:37,076
But there's dangers of isolating,
and becoming obsessed with things.

462
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,436
And having phobias.

463
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:43,326
Each of those planets was
a phobia of mine when I was little.

464
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:47,295
And when I was little, before bed,
I would obsess about these things.

465
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:49,463
Because I thought I could fix them.

466
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,591
But in the end,
I would just make them worse.

467
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,595
They wouldn't be fixed.
But I'd be so obsessed with them ...

468
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,598
... I'd have stomach aches and have to
go home from school.

469
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,476
A lot of the imagery,
I'm still very happy with.

470
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:08,226
To me it speaks perfectly of
how I felt when I was little.

471
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:13,306
When I play that game. It's exactly
how I remember it feeling.

472
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:18,236
Shortly after Aether,
my Grandma passed away.

473
00:26:18,406 --> 00:26:21,746
And she had a box of my drawings
that she saved.

474
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,415
From when I was little.

475
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,043
That's when I found this picture ...

476
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:30,671
... that I had drawn of me in space.
Floating.

477
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,215
And it says ...

478
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:35,718
This is Edmund floating in space.
And my friend too is space...

479
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,158
Or something like that.

480
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:41,556
'Space is my friend.
And my friend too is me.'

481
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,603
It was validating to find that box.
And see those things and be like ...

482
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,480
Wow.

483
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,405
This is just like the game.

484
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,320
<i>[Sounds of children playing]</i>

485
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:15,675
I have a very precise story of the
exact moment it started.

486
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,885
I was four.

487
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,430
It was Christmas, 1988.

488
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,433
And for Christmas I got
a Nintendo with:

489
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,571
'Mario', 'Zelda' and 'Tetris'

490
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,941
Which is perfect.
The 'Trifecta' of video games.

491
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,526
To this day, you can't really get
a better three games together.

492
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,005
It was clear at that moment.

493
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:39,631
That this is what I wanted
to do with my life.

494
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:42,410
I've known since I was four.

495
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,785
There was never any doubt about it.
I wanted to make games.

496
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,831
What that entailed wasn't
always clear.

497
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,453
You're four and you want to
make games...

498
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:53,521
It just seems like:
'Oh, you come up with ideas'

499
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:56,880
'And then you have a game. Awesome.'

500
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,258
There she is.

501
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,658
What a beauty.

502
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,425
<i>[Computer starts up]</i>

503
00:28:05,593 --> 00:28:09,728
So this is the game me and my Dad made
back in 1993.

504
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:14,436
Based on art I would make in 'Kid Pix'

505
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,781
He would take that, and turn it into
these simple 'Find the Object' games.

506
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,266
So I would come home from school ...

507
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,696
... and levels would be
added to the game.

508
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:29,381
Based on stuff I made in the days
before.

509
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:34,420
At first, they were really
simple 'Where's Waldo' type things.

510
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,881
Where's the letter 'V'?

511
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,968
Oh, there it is.

512
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:44,138
It's so completely abstract.

513
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:47,593
Because it's all my art. And it made
no sense.

514
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:49,810
OH! 'Cyber Vision'

515
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,658
This is the best one.

516
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:53,335
This is a piece of software...

517
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:54,936
<i>"Software"</i>

518
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:58,276
That I made.
It's the stupidest thing...

519
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:02,981
It's just patterns that I designed.
And I made it invert the colors.

520
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:04,740
Really really quickly.

521
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:10,373
You pick your pattern and
the number of flashes.

522
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:14,538
And then you're supposed
stick your face in it...

523
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:16,921
And stare at it.

524
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:18,933
Like this...

525
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:22,593
For a long time.

526
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,271
And I swear to God, you start
to see stuff.

527
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:30,226
Oh my God.

528
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,730
What was wrong with me?!?

529
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,438
This is still awesome!

530
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,703
<i>[Sound of keyboard typing]</i>

531
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,256
So, the way that I approach
design ...

532
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:04,131
... is really kind of experiential.

533
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,053
I'm thinking about ...

534
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,286
... when the player comes on the
screen. What's happening?

535
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:13,536
Not quite in the same way as a movie.
But sort of.

536
00:30:13,706 --> 00:30:18,065
You have to put your mind in the
viewpoint of the player....

537
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,801
Thinking about
what's going to happen.

538
00:30:20,971 --> 00:30:23,153
There's an excitement about ideas
unfolding ...

539
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,573
... that I try to put into it.

540
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:30,036
It's a stream of communication between
designer and player.

541
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:35,041
And the design of a level like this,
is sort of a dialogue...

542
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,080
... or at least a monologue ...

543
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,511
Where it's like:
'Hey! Check this out...'

544
00:30:40,683 --> 00:30:44,071
<i>'Did you realize you we're going to
have a problem with that ladder?'</i>

545
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:48,133
<i>'Isn't it weird, but cool, that you
could have such a problem...'</i>

546
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:51,305
<i>'...just because this ladder was a bit
to the left'</i>

547
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:55,186
<i>'If it was over here or here, you
wouldn't have that problem.'</i>

548
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:59,220
That is the interesting part,
the important part.

549
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:02,136
It's not important that it's a tricky
puzzle ...

550
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,851
...that takes some thinking to solve.

551
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:10,171
That's a little cool.
But any puzzle game can give you that.

552
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:19,210
But what a special game can give you
is details.

553
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:22,960
Interesting insights into particular
situations.

554
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,338
And I think when a game realizes that.
Seizing that way of doing things.

555
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:29,666
And runs with it.

556
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:33,266
It can do some really special things.

557
00:31:46,325 --> 00:31:48,570
I'm very visual.

558
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:55,208
As a person. I like pretty things.
I like aesthetics.

559
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:58,621
A big part of FEZ is the aesthetic.

560
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:05,340
That kind of pleasant,
blue sky, green grass, fresh air -

561
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:10,511
obviously, there's no fresh air
in the game.

562
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:14,598
This is how art works in the game.

563
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:20,730
I make these little strips for the
four sides that you see in the game.

564
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,940
And the top and bottom of every cube.

565
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:29,006
And Renaud made a Photoshop script
that crops them, and saves them...

566
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:31,145
And feeds them to the game.

567
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:34,860
And the game wraps
these textures around a cube.

568
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,063
And projects the art on each side.

569
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:41,208
You can see the different sides
of the texture strip.

570
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,255
I can then take the cube and carve in
details.

571
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:51,176
You can barely see it in the game. You
only really feel it in the rotation.

572
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:57,478
I use the 'Tetris' pattern a lot.

573
00:32:57,648 --> 00:33:02,060
It's kind of a pain. Because I have
to go in there and paint it.

574
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:06,735
And reorient the tiles by hand.

575
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:10,238
So, here:
I don't like this big straight line.

576
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:12,115
It's kind of awkward.

577
00:33:12,285 --> 00:33:14,866
I'm going to make it a 'T' shape.

578
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,370
I spend a lot of time doing this.

579
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,956
I build these elaborate structures.

580
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:24,251
And eventually, I spend an afternoon
going over everything.

581
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:27,140
I guess I've been staring at it
for too long.

582
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:30,486
I obsess over the tiniest details.

583
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:37,598
One thing that happened.

584
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:42,728
I never did pixel art before FEZ.
So I had to learn.

585
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:46,398
You do that for three years.
Then at the end...

586
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,568
... you're better than
you used to be.

587
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,986
And all the art you made
three years ago...

588
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,198
Isn't as good as
what you're making now.

589
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:58,755
And there's a divide.
So I had to retouch a lot of old stuff

590
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:01,080
I do everything three times.

591
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,585
And it takes me three and a half years
to make a video game.

592
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:29,596
Level design.

593
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,071
So, the basic formula of
level design go..

594
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:37,658
When you start out, you want to teach
the player how to play.

595
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:41,101
Making sure they understand
every mechanic of the game.

596
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:45,196
So every level in the first chapter
needs to force to player...

597
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:50,046
...to do something they will need
further in the game.

598
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:53,836
For example, on level three,
there's just a gap.

599
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:58,845
The only way to get over that gap
is to hold 'run' and press 'jump'

600
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:03,308
You can't get it any other way.
You won't jump far enough.

601
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,353
And that's makes sure the player
understands...

602
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,315
... in order to get over
big gaps.

603
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:11,411
You need to hold 'run'
and press 'Jump'

604
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:14,200
It's simple.
It sounds like a 'no-brainer'.

605
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:17,990
Usually, games would just say:
'Hold run to jump far'

606
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,510
Most people would just skip the text
and forget.

607
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,246
Now, just in case somebody didn't
play that level.

608
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,898
A couple levels later...

609
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:30,126
I reiterate and give another section
requiring them to run and jump.

610
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,755
To make sure they know.
Because it's important.

611
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,038
All these mechanics are very important

612
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:38,573
Each early level is a level
that pushes that...

613
00:35:38,743 --> 00:35:41,973
Like, there's a level where you need
to continuously jump up one wall.

614
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:44,040
Because there is no other wall
to jump to.

615
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,006
That's me teaching the player that:

616
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,500
'You can do this'.

617
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:50,668
Everybody in the world will see a
problem and want to solve it.

618
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,483
If you see something that's
just a wall.

619
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:56,028
And you don't realize that you can
keep jumping up.

620
00:35:56,198 --> 00:36:00,040
You're going to try it. And once
you try it, you've taught yourself.

621
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,160
Not only do you feel smart.

622
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:04,411
But you now, for sure ...

623
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,415
... know how to do that for the
rest of the game.

624
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:10,876
So, you go through everything in the
early 'introduction' levels.

625
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:14,220
Once you've covered all the things
you can do with Meat Boy...

626
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:16,573
...then you introduce new mechanics.

627
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,485
With Meat Boy, it's not like Mario.

628
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:21,545
Lots of Mario games introduce
mechanics in forms of 'suits'....

629
00:36:21,718 --> 00:36:23,830
... that change Mario's properties.

630
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:27,351
That's something I wanted to avoid.
I wanted to make it really pure.

631
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,146
Meat Boy never gets better
or gets a 'Power Up'

632
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:34,275
It's the levels that change .
Changing the mechanics.

633
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,935
So right away, you introduce 'Saws'.

634
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,946
And they're saws that spin in place.

635
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:41,626
And you have to avoid these saws.

636
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:44,743
And then later, those same saws -

637
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,435
You know that they kill you.

638
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,928
Those same saws will start moving
back and forth.

639
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:52,940
So you got moving saws.

640
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,671
Then later, you have saws on spinners

641
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,715
That act like Windmills.

642
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,725
And they go around in a circle.

643
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:03,136
Now it's the same saw that you jumped
over a million times before.

644
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,098
But it's in a different way.

645
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:09,018
Making it different and more enjoyable

646
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,698
As a designer, you want to explore
each mechanic...

647
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:15,150
...making sure it can be used
at least 3 or 4 different ways.

648
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,568
If it's only got one use...

649
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,583
...then it's pointless.

650
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:22,031
Because you need to be able to
'juice it'

651
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,046
You have to figure out new ways
to use it.

652
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:30,206
<i>[FEZ sound effects can be heard]</i>

653
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:42,926
The game has become
a bit of a reflection of me over time.

654
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:45,365
It certainly wasn't the intention
at first.

655
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,305
I started noticing a few things...

656
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:51,723
That kind of reflect
my experience of working on the game.

657
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:54,396
It's a game about games.

658
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:57,441
And the world is very much
a computer world.

659
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:01,111
It's a world within a computer.
There's a lot of computer logic to it.

660
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,781
Every now and then,
the universe becomes unstable...

661
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:08,828
... and has to defragment itself
and reboot.

662
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:11,536
That's the goal of the game.

663
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:15,293
In FEZ, you're putting these pieces
of the universe back together.

664
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:17,913
And try to make it stable again.

665
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,115
I basically feel like ...

666
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:22,213
... the entire world is falling apart
around me these days.

667
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:30,683
Here's a recap of the last two years
or so...

668
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:34,028
So, we moved into our first office.
We had our funding.

669
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:36,966
That was great.
Everything was coming along.

670
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:40,776
Then my Dad was diagnosed with
leukemia

671
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:44,770
We were told he had a 50-50 chance
of dying within weeks.

672
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,035
He was a test subject for this
new treatment.

673
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,828
<i>'Well, you're going to die anyways'</i>

674
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,456
<i>'You might want to give this crazy
treatment a shot. You might live'</i>

675
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:54,843
So he lived.

676
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:58,711
Shortly after that, my parents
divorced ... Which is never fun.

677
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,376
I had to move my dad into
a new apartment.

678
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,493
Shortly after that,
my girlfriend left me.

679
00:39:04,663 --> 00:39:05,926
About a year ago.

680
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:10,575
Some time after that, there started
being a lot of tension between me ...

681
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:14,310
... and the guy who owned
the other half of the company.

682
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,145
Eventually, he left.

683
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:17,896
And that was a big blow.

684
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:22,056
All of a sudden I had to take care of
every aspect of the company.

685
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,780
Almost immediately after that,
we lost our funding.

686
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,200
And now we're here.
We don't have any money.

687
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,928
I'm overworked and over-stressed.

688
00:39:33,098 --> 00:39:34,198
I'm on the line.

689
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:37,898
Me. My name ... My career.

690
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:40,003
If this fails.

691
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:41,883
I'm done.

692
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:44,731
I don't think I'll work in games again

693
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:49,345
And it's not just a game.
I'm so closely attached to it.

694
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:53,731
It's me.
It's my Ego, my perception of myself.

695
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:57,228
Is at risk. This is my identity: FEZ.

696
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:59,630
... I'm guy making FEZ

697
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,795
That's about it.

698
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,135
If that doesn't work out then...

699
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:07,738
<i>Interviewer:
What would happen if you personally...</i>

700
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:10,071
<i>[INTERVIEWER]:
If you couldn't finish the game?</i>

701
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:13,145
I would kill myself.

702
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,566
I would kill myself.

703
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,625
That's my incentive to finish it.

704
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:21,711
Because then I get to not kill myself.

705
00:40:58,436 --> 00:41:02,460
A typical day at this point in
development...

706
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,795
Usually, I wake up
at 4:00 or 4:30 in the afternoon.

707
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,883
Because I've gone to bed at...

708
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:12,508
... 9 or 10 a.m. the night / morning
before.

709
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,923
I check emails.

710
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,766
There's usually something there from
'localization'.

711
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,145
Or from Kevin, our Microsoft producer.

712
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:26,651
Or any number of Microsoft people;
asking for different things.

713
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:32,635
I make my breakfast. Which consists of
a microwaved sandwich.

714
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:34,061
It's pretty good.

715
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:37,245
I take insulin for that.

716
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:40,290
And then, I just work on ...

717
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,371
...whatever's on the list.

718
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,045
I have a couple of lists ...

719
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:50,800
...I retire a list once I spill
food on it.

720
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:54,053
These are actually surprisingly clean.

721
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,075
This was a big one.
This was 'code complete'

722
00:41:58,243 --> 00:42:01,603
But you can see the grease stains.
Where you can see through it.

723
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,386
That's when I retired that one.

724
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:07,066
Me and Ed are handling a lot of stuff
for two people.

725
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:10,473
But we're right there at the end...

726
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:13,858
... so we just sort of do it.

727
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,741
We're both very very tired

728
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:16,951
But at the same time...

729
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,745
We're tired. Not so much from work.

730
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:23,625
But from not being able to sleep.
Because of thinking about work.

731
00:42:28,118 --> 00:42:30,673
I'm like in
a fucking concentration camp.

732
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:33,843
Like, I'm not allowed out
and I'm stuck.

733
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,093
I have to work until it's done.

734
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,758
And if it doesn't get done ...

735
00:42:38,928 --> 00:42:40,595
I'm fucked.

736
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:41,558
No pressure.

737
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,573
If you can't get the work done...

738
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:47,815
...then the past two years are
basically worth nothing.

739
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,550
No pressure.

740
00:42:52,075 --> 00:42:54,571
We got a call from Microsoft saying...

741
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:57,366
We're going to do this thing called:
'The Game Feast'

742
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:59,386
An Xbox promotion.

743
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,896
<i>They said: If you want to get in...</i>

744
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:04,591
<i>...you have to have the game done
in a month.</i>

745
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:05,738
And we're like: 'whoa'

746
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:08,961
Because we weren't anywhere close to
being ready ... at all.

747
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:10,796
They asked:
'Do you think it's possible?'

748
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,341
And Tommy said:
'Well, we shoot for it.'

749
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:16,025
'And if we miss it, we miss it.'

750
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,388
And they said: 'If you miss it,
we can't launch until February'

751
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:22,266
Tommy doesn't have any money.

752
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,280
I'm running out of money.
It's just like:

753
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,936
We HAVE to do this now.

754
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,188
We HAVE to do this.

755
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,520
There were at least five times...

756
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,733
...where I totally broke down.

757
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:36,278
I just didn't want to do it anymore.

758
00:43:36,576 --> 00:43:38,198
I couldn't escape in any way.

759
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,993
So I would just go into the bathtub...

760
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:44,140
And I'd turn on the hot water shower.

761
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:48,793
And I'd lay down on my back.
and wait until the water went cold.

762
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:50,808
That was all I had.

763
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,941
That was all I had to try
to relax myself.

764
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:55,913
and not worry about anything.

765
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:59,386
I was actually worried that either
Tommy or I would die...

766
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:02,015
... in the process of making this.

767
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:04,360
And Tommy talked about it too...

768
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:08,125
As long as he could finish this game.
He would be Okay with dying.

769
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:10,315
Because at least he finished the game.

770
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:12,150
It was fucking weird.

771
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,026
You go crazy when you're like this.

772
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:16,500
That's why I obviously grew this
mustache.

773
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:19,531
It is the 'Reclusive Cowboy'.

774
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:23,953
I need everybody to know
how crazy I feel...

775
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,446
... on the outside.

776
00:44:36,116 --> 00:44:42,491
Edmund and I talk all the time.
About everything. We're best friends.

777
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:45,141
But we were talking about
if the game does well.

778
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:47,833
He was reading some quotes on success.

779
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:49,061
It was something like...

780
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:54,483
<i>The hardest part of success is finding
people that will be happy for you.</i>

781
00:44:55,238 --> 00:44:59,363
I know, for sure, I have three people
that are going to be happy for me.

782
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,076
Forever, my parents have been
supportive of whatever I wanted to do.

783
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:08,088
They've done, everything they could
to make sure ...

784
00:45:08,258 --> 00:45:10,625
... that I'm alright.

785
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:16,088
They've seen some hard times,
with the economy and stuff like that.

786
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,051
After our last president
messed everything up.

787
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,050
They were four years from paying off
this house.

788
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:24,438
This house ...

789
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:29,640
My Dad, and my Mom, built this house.

790
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:32,770
It was completed right before
I was born.

791
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,525
And they were four years from paying
it off and had to re-finance it.

792
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:39,318
I'm hoping if a lot of people
buy the game...

793
00:45:39,491 --> 00:45:42,665
... I can slap a bow on the top
of the roof. And say:

794
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:44,381
<i>'Here you go!'</i>

795
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,913
<i>'This is what you get for
being awesome parents my entire life.'</i>

796
00:45:53,345 --> 00:45:56,336
So Meat Boy is a boy made of meat.

797
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:59,620
But when designing him,
it wasn't a thought of...

798
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,631
...he's made of steak or whatever else

799
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,471
It was: 'Hey, he doesn't have skin'

800
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,406
He's a boy without skin.
That's why they call him Meat Boy.

801
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:11,351
So he's exposed to the elements.

802
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,350
Maybe he's always in pain.

803
00:46:13,518 --> 00:46:14,855
But he just deals with it.

804
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:16,865
But he has to be very careful with
everything.

805
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:18,931
Because anything can kill him.

806
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:21,398
The smallest little thing - like salt

807
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:23,803
Could totally destroy him.

808
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:30,246
I wanted to have his girlfriend be
more than a love interest.

809
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:35,085
And I wanted to play with the idea
that he needs her ...

810
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,296
... that she's what completes him.

811
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:41,435
Not just emotionally, but physically
as well.

812
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:43,776
And that's why she's 'Bandage Girl'.

813
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:47,555
She's kind of the outer shell over
Meat Boy.

814
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:49,056
That protects him.

815
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,496
And that's why he needs her.

816
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:53,643
He needs her back.

817
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,271
Not only because he loves her,
but because...

818
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,608
That's what completes him.

819
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:01,986
<i>The Seumas McNally Grand Prize ...</i>

820
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,330
<i>... in the 'Open Category'</i>

821
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:07,366
<i>Goes to Chronic Logic for 'Gish'!</i>

822
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:13,118
Thank you everybody.

823
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:16,331
Okay, I'd like to take this
opportunity to...

824
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,751
...propose to my girlfriend, Danielle.

825
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:35,476
Okay, Okay, I have to do it. Co'mon
guys, I have to actually say it.

826
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,355
Danielle.

827
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:41,066
Will you marry me?

828
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,076
People probably don't know that
he's an amazing husband.

829
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:50,733
That's ... huge.

830
00:47:50,903 --> 00:47:53,496
He does all this stuff and he's still
an amazing partner.

831
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:57,430
The development process was long.
A lot of work.

832
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,546
It was hard to adapt
our relationship.

833
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,550
To go from spending 24/7 together ...

834
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,091
... eating meals together.

835
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:10,638
Leaving the house,
to not doing that at all.

836
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:14,641
I heard a lot of this:
'I only see your back'

837
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,020
It was like:
'I know we're in the same room ...'

838
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:19,940
'... but I only see your back'

839
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:23,066
We're never sitting and
looking at each other.

840
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:27,030
Many times, I had to ask her:
'Are you happy here?'

841
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:29,198
'Is this worth it?'

842
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:33,661
'Because I worry that this is just
horribly boring for you'

843
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:38,331
'And that this might be something you
regret getting into as well.'

844
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,376
This is the lady I like.

845
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:44,463
Not th- This is a Cat.

846
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:48,211
This website. I think I'm going to go
with this breeder.

847
00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:51,888
I've wanted one of these since
I was little.

848
00:48:52,058 --> 00:48:54,888
I asked for it. When the game's done.

849
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:58,311
And we move to a house.
If I could get a cat.

850
00:48:58,648 --> 00:48:59,871
And he said 'yes'.

851
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:04,108
And this is my dream cat.
It's like having a baby.

852
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,860
Except better.

853
00:49:06,195 --> 00:49:09,280
<i>We can't have another cat
in this house.</i>

854
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:12,490
Oh, it'd be some warm. OOOH My God!

855
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,993
<i>That's the thing...</i>

856
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:16,003
Available, AVAILABLE

857
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:17,275
<i>... Winter's coming.</i>

858
00:49:17,443 --> 00:49:19,788
This one belongs
to 'Jennifer and Robert'.

859
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,140
They're probably way happier than us.

860
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,545
Right at this moment.

861
00:49:23,715 --> 00:49:26,840
Because they have the cat.

862
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:31,093
I ... sacrificed having a life.

863
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:32,845
It's kind of weird.

864
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:34,870
I don't ...

865
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,850
I don't go out.

866
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:39,833
I don't really socialize.

867
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:43,398
I can't spend money.
Because I don't have any money.

868
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,855
So I can't go out...

869
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:49,320
If I were to go on a date...

870
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:51,698
I have no car to pick them up in.

871
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:54,713
I have no way to buy meals
or anything.

872
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:58,763
I mean, I can buy my own meal, but..

873
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:03,743
... the things you sacrifice are ...

874
00:50:04,011 --> 00:50:06,751
... the things I've sacrificed are ...

875
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,630
... social.

876
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:15,265
You kind of have to give up something.
To have something great.

877
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:19,183
I'm depressed now ...

878
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:22,520
... because I'm on the
brink of something huge.

879
00:50:22,693 --> 00:50:25,710
It's a different kind of depression.
It's not a 'stuck' depression.

880
00:50:25,878 --> 00:50:29,103
It's a 'Holy Shit' depression.
It's an 'unknown' depression.

881
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,743
Which is kind of weird.
But, it'll fade.

882
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:34,421
Because once it's out. It's out.
And that's it.

883
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:40,121
<i>[Super Meat Boy will be
released in 3 days.]</i>

884
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:51,246
I'm really curious to see what the
basic reaction is.

885
00:50:51,413 --> 00:50:54,110
Because, the only people who have
seen the game so far...

886
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,810
Have been people close to me.

887
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,125
<i>[FEZ has been in
development for 4 years]</i>

888
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:02,810
Feedback has been good.
But I can't trust that feedback

889
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,438
I don't know if my friends would
tell me if FEZ sucked.

890
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:08,190
Knowing that I've spent most
of my adult life on it.

891
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,026
Because, I don't even know what
I think about it anymore.

892
00:51:11,195 --> 00:51:13,465
I really can't tell
if it's good or not.

893
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:16,725
Sometimes I manage to convince myself
that it's good and I did a good job.

894
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:20,445
But then I have a flash of lucidity.

895
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:22,491
<i>'But you can't trust yourself!'</i>

896
00:51:22,756 --> 00:51:26,710
All you've been doing for 4 years
is look at it. Like, this close.

897
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,753
You can't see anything else.

898
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:30,421
You don't even see the mistakes
anymore.

899
00:51:30,616 --> 00:51:33,758
I'm looking forward to that kind of
brutal honesty.

900
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:36,768
That we're going to get from
the average gamer.

901
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,176
We're here for PAX: Penny Arcade Expo

902
00:51:40,346 --> 00:51:42,510
It's not for developers.
It's for gamers.

903
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,603
They're expecting like 65,000 people.

904
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,650
We're going to be showing off FEZ
for the first time since 2008.

905
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:54,993
Which was the unveiling of the game.
We haven't shown it since.

906
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:56,548
In four years.

907
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:58,888
So ... I'm a bit nervous.

908
00:51:59,446 --> 00:52:03,663
But this is kind of like the
big blow out. The confirmation that:

909
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:06,958
Yes. FEZ is real. It's exists.

910
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:11,341
It's going to come out, and you'll be
able to buy it and play it one day.

911
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,543
Hopefully interest will build up again

912
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:18,886
Because I feel that over the years,
people have stopped caring.

913
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:22,133
They may need to be reminded
that we exist.

914
00:52:22,328 --> 00:52:24,636
And for the first time,
I've feel like:

915
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:27,548
This is FEZ.
This is the game I wanted to make.

916
00:52:27,718 --> 00:52:30,301
There's a mood here,
that I've achieved.

917
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,041
It's not done yet.

918
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,675
But it's really starting to feel
like a game ...

919
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:37,030
That has a beginning, middle
and an end.

920
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:42,035
It remains to be seen if the game's
going to be good.

921
00:52:43,538 --> 00:52:45,580
But I'm pretty damn happy with it ...

922
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,790
... today.

923
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:50,366
<i>Interviewer: What's the worst case
scenario for you?</i>

924
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:52,578
None of this happens.

925
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:57,216
We don't get to show the game at PAX.
Or do anything with it.

926
00:52:58,305 --> 00:53:00,883
For very complicated legal reasons.

927
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:05,391
My former business partner with whom
I started the company...

928
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,060
Left the company.
About six months ago.

929
00:53:08,236 --> 00:53:10,378
And we've been in
a nasty divorce ever since.

930
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,863
And if everything isn't settled.

931
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:20,656
We can't do anything.
We can't show it. We can't be at PAX.

932
00:53:21,178 --> 00:53:22,595
Just a final signature.

933
00:53:22,763 --> 00:53:26,618
This last signature, to close the deal

934
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:28,790
So, at the moment...

935
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,126
We drove all the way here.
We printed banners.

936
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:34,711
We designed a booth.
I made a demo just for PAX.

937
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,715
There's still a chance that ...

938
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:38,966
... I'm just going to stay in
my hotel room.

939
00:53:39,135 --> 00:53:41,003
And not be able to do any of this.

940
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:45,473
It's pretty stressful.

941
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:47,741
It feels like waiting.

942
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:50,185
Everything feels longer.

943
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,270
It feels like I'm about to throw up.

944
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:54,523
It's stage fright.

945
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:56,941
I have a hard time sleeping.

946
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,066
I can't think of anything else.

947
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,323
It's constantly running through
my head.

948
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:07,203
And it's such a big deal.
There are going to be so many people.

949
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:12,878
I'm not in a head space right now...

950
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:16,713
...where I want to be exposing myself.
And being a public figure.

951
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:18,673
And talking to people.

952
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:22,176
I'm so in my own little world.

953
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:24,490
Just working on FEZ.
Trying to finish it.

954
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,701
I don't do anything else.

955
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,863
Every other aspect
of my life is suffering.

956
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:30,513
Because I'm just trying to finish
this fucking game.

957
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,523
Because right now.
It can go either way.

958
00:54:35,696 --> 00:54:38,360
It could be a nightmare
... I don't know.

959
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,655
<i>[Ha! Ahhh, Man!]</i>

960
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:44,641
<i>[Hey, This is Souja Boy]</i>

961
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,743
<i>[They got this game right?
This shit called 'Braid']</i>

962
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:51,440
<i>[Watch this Shit!]</i>

963
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:52,896
<i>[You're this little guy
in a business suit</i>

964
00:54:53,066 --> 00:54:55,706
<i>[It look like Mario
... in the future]</i>

965
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,895
<i>[And he's just walking around,
jumping on shit]</i>

966
00:54:58,065 --> 00:55:00,586
<i>[But the funny part is:
You can do this, watch this...]</i>

967
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:05,686
<i>[Now, if you didn't catch that.
I just went back in time.]</i>

968
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:09,878
On release day, you start seeing
reactions of people on the Internet.

969
00:55:10,048 --> 00:55:12,435
And for me, it was
a very addictive thing.

970
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:18,400
Because I've spent several years
working on this thing in isolation.

971
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:22,521
And then suddenly it gets out.
And a lot of people...

972
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:26,361
... like tens of thousands of people
play it in the first few days.

973
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,186
You see that all over the Internet.

974
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:32,180
And, for me,
that was a very negative experience.

975
00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:37,246
When Braid was coming out.
People would talk about it online.

976
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:45,708
And this was around the birth of
serious video game blog commentary

977
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:50,973
Lots of people writing really good
stuff about games.

978
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:56,821
Every time you mentioned his name.
He would show up in your comments.

979
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,440
Almost instantly.

980
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:00,858
He must have something even better
than 'Google Alerts'

981
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:05,530
So he'd pop up and reply to things.
Or correct people on things.

982
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,666
And became sort of famous for it.
Penny Arcade even cracked about it.

983
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,580
John:
I found that there was this...

984
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,925
Perception of me on the Internet ...

985
00:56:16,093 --> 00:56:18,318
...that was running away, very quickly
from who I think I am

986
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:21,656
And that was ... kind of ...
disturbing.

987
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:24,631
And there didn't seem to be much that
I could do about that.

988
00:56:25,011 --> 00:56:27,885
So that was actually a pretty negative
experience.

989
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:35,101
I was actually seriously depressed for
about 3-4 months after Braid came out

990
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:41,375
When you work a long time on something
really intricate like that.

991
00:56:41,543 --> 00:56:43,776
There's a hope that ...

992
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:48,781
... people are going to understand
the things that you did.

993
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,426
And that you'll have some line of
communication with your audience.

994
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:56,953
And actually, some of the most
demoralizing things...

995
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:00,248
Were actually positive reviews
of the game.

996
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:02,875
People would say
'Oh, this game's great!'

997
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,033
'9 out of 10!'

998
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:05,506
'10 out of 10!'

999
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,673
And they'd say what's good
about the game...

1000
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:12,178
And in many cases it would be just a
very surface understanding of the game

1001
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,660
That didn't even see what I thought
was most special about it.

1002
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,768
Not that many people understood.

1003
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:20,230
And that was heartbreaking.
In a way.

1004
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,608
I visualized I was going to have some
kind of connection with people.

1005
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:26,526
... through this game.

1006
00:57:26,696 --> 00:57:30,176
And they think it's great,
but the connection isn't there.

1007
00:57:30,348 --> 00:57:33,010
Because, they're kind of living
in a different world still.

1008
00:57:33,218 --> 00:57:37,913
So they think it's great ...
for some of the reasons I do, but...

1009
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,038
... but not for other ...

1010
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,455
...

1011
00:57:43,675 --> 00:57:45,505
<i>[There's no point to the game!]</i>

1012
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:47,398
<i>[You just walk around jumping on shit]</i>

1013
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:51,343
... they're not seeing the most
important thing.

1014
00:57:51,931 --> 00:57:55,168
<i>[This shit's stupid as hell man...]</i>

1015
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:12,516
Today is Monday.
And that's the 'Embargo' Date.

1016
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:14,450
Do you know what an 'Embargo' is?

1017
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,401
I didn't.
And I got in trouble for not knowing.

1018
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:22,833
An Embargo is: You set a date
when press can review your game.

1019
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:31,328
So, midnite rolls around. And I start
refreshing 'Twitter mentions'

1020
00:58:31,498 --> 00:58:34,176
You can search who's talking about
Super Meat Boy.

1021
00:58:34,346 --> 00:58:37,303
And reviews just start popping out.

1022
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:40,703
So, I just start grabbing quotes
and posting them.

1023
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:43,935
<i>So we got:
'A great experience 4 out of 5'</i>

1024
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,368
<i>'Super Meat Boy
revels in driving you crazy...'</i>

1025
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,568
<i>'...but you end up
crazy in love.'</i>

1026
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:49,568
<i>'... 9 out of 10'</i>

1027
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,580
<i>'Brutal and hilarious'
'5 out of 5'</i>

1028
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,993
<i>'I've never felt so challenged
and rewarded...</i>

1029
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,281
<i>... in all my years playing with meat'</i>

1030
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,800
I don't know who that is.
But I posted it.

1031
00:58:59,055 --> 00:59:02,706
All these reviews keep coming in.
And the whole time, I'm thinking...

1032
00:59:02,895 --> 00:59:07,295
...I'm waiting for the really bad one.
Some one has to hate it.

1033
00:59:07,755 --> 00:59:09,421
<i>'Super Meat Boy
can stand confidently ...</i>

1034
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:11,273
<i>... next to Mario
and the platforming elite.</i>

1035
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:14,830
<i>'It's the best game on XBLA'
'This game is wonderful: 10 out of 10'</i>

1036
00:59:15,058 --> 00:59:17,713
<i>It's a love letter to
everything great about video games.</i>

1037
00:59:17,883 --> 00:59:19,925
<i>'This is nothing short of greatness.'</i>

1038
00:59:20,093 --> 00:59:21,636
<i>'Buy it now! '
'5 out of 5!'</i>

1039
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:23,971
They just kept coming and kept coming.

1040
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:27,981
I did not expect this. At all.

1041
00:59:28,486 --> 00:59:31,296
I honestly
did not expect these reviews.

1042
00:59:31,466 --> 00:59:32,671
<i>'Get this game now!'
'10 out of 10''</i>

1043
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:35,366
<i>'4.5 out of 5'
'9 out of 10', '9.5 out of 10'</i>

1044
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:38,910
It's weird to be launching the same
time as 'Fallout'...

1045
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,326
... and be getting reviews that are
almost better.

1046
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:48,753
That's weird. Especially since it's
a game I'm going to be buying.

1047
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:51,870
It's pretty fucking awesome.

1048
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:03,560
I don't know if you guys realize
how frustrating it is.

1049
01:00:04,218 --> 01:00:08,223
I don't think you understand
what's weird about it.

1050
01:00:08,393 --> 01:00:09,816
I don't care...

1051
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:13,236
I really don't care what any
of the reviews say.

1052
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:16,196
It's just weird that they're there.

1053
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:18,196
Positive or negative.

1054
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:23,120
It doesn't matter that we get
nines and tens...

1055
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,748
... it doesn't matter.

1056
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:29,710
Yeah, but, I've been weird all my life
about stuff.

1057
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:34,678
It's kind of weird to have people say:

1058
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:39,051
<i>'Hey, you're going to be rich.
You can buy me a car...'</i>

1059
01:00:39,225 --> 01:00:41,221
You know, just joking kind of stuff.

1060
01:00:41,448 --> 01:00:43,098
But they're not joking.

1061
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,976
I mean, they're joking about
me buying them a car.

1062
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,350
Because I'm totally not buying anyone
a car.

1063
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:50,986
Except my parents, if they want one.

1064
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,693
But, to hear that ...

1065
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,153
...

1066
01:00:55,323 --> 01:01:00,075
To hear that everything that I dreamed
about for years and years and years...

1067
01:01:00,245 --> 01:01:02,805
... is going to basically come true,
in like two days.

1068
01:01:02,976 --> 01:01:05,733
And has already started to ...
is very...odd.

1069
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:09,453
I cry at the idea of crying about it.

1070
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,281
That's weird.

1071
01:01:13,216 --> 01:01:17,966
I cried when we submitted
the game to certification.

1072
01:01:18,228 --> 01:01:21,805
I cried because it was like...

1073
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:26,266
It was like sending
your kid off to school.

1074
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,116
And we just had to wait.

1075
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,283
We worked on it so hard.

1076
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:38,280
We were non-stop for, like, two months

1077
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:41,700
Doing ungodly amounts of work.

1078
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:46,370
Then we send it off to certification.
And its like:

1079
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:49,081
<i>'OK, we'll let you know in two weeks'</i>

1080
01:01:49,316 --> 01:01:50,708
It's like: 'Aarrghh!'

1081
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:52,723
Is it going to pass?
Is it not going to pass?

1082
01:01:52,893 --> 01:01:53,736
Am I going to have to fix bugs?

1083
01:01:53,906 --> 01:01:55,861
And then when I would play the game.
And I would see bugs.

1084
01:01:56,031 --> 01:01:58,790
And then I'd panic and I'd email
Microsoft. And I'd go:

1085
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:02,816
<i>'Oh God! The game doesn't show
PEGI ratings ...'</i>

1086
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:08,768
<i>'... if it's run in European regions.'</i>

1087
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:11,100
<i>'Is that going to be a problem?'</i>

1088
01:02:11,268 --> 01:02:14,115
And they're like: 'Oh no, it's fine'

1089
01:02:14,283 --> 01:02:16,606
And it's like: 'Oh? Okay then.'
[laughs]

1090
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:22,781
I can't shake the idea that...

1091
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,536
...even though they're good reviews.

1092
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:28,536
That we'll still fail.

1093
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:30,536
Is that weird?

1094
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:32,915
Is that weird to feel that way?

1095
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,170
Because it feels normal to me.
And I know it feels normal to Tommy.

1096
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:38,590
But, there's still a part of me
that says:

1097
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:41,600
<i>'Even though we have the highest rated
game on Xbox Live...'</i>

1098
01:02:41,768 --> 01:02:45,276
<i>'...we're still going to fail.'</i>

1099
01:02:48,048 --> 01:02:50,446
Tommy, Do you feel the same way?

1100
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:53,100
There's still a part of me that
worries we can fail.

1101
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:56,858
<i>Yeah, it is there</i>

1102
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:00,320
<i>It's there. It's a real thing.</i>

1103
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:03,198
<i>The only way I could see it failing...</i>

1104
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:06,281
<i>...is if the first 1,000 people
download the game...</i>

1105
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,406
<i>...and get the game save error...</i>

1106
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:12,320
<i>... and then get online
and trash the shit out of the game.</i>

1107
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:16,335
<i>Yeah... those are different worries
for you.</i>

1108
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:19,630
I know that, yeah, people may
lose their save.

1109
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,426
But they'll still enjoy the game
and we're going to fix it.

1110
01:03:23,891 --> 01:03:24,908
<i>Ouch!</i>

1111
01:03:26,258 --> 01:03:30,225
So this is press contacts to
578 people.

1112
01:03:33,398 --> 01:03:39,066
So I'll send out the press release.
Update the website. Update my blog.

1113
01:03:39,443 --> 01:03:43,410
Update my Facebook,
and call it a night.

1114
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,740
What are you going to do Tommy?

1115
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:48,446
<i>Uhh... What happened?</i>

1116
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,535
<i>I just fell asleep.</i>

1117
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:51,913
Really?

1118
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:54,748
<i>Yeah... uh...uh...
What, what did you say?</i>

1119
01:03:57,378 --> 01:03:59,126
Um, nothing.

1120
01:04:23,415 --> 01:04:27,323
This morning I got an email
from Renaud saying that...

1121
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,618
...my ex-associate was on his way
to PAX...

1122
01:04:31,855 --> 01:04:35,416
...for some other game
he's working on.

1123
01:04:36,378 --> 01:04:38,253
He still hasn't signed.

1124
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:41,381
He's going to be on the road most of
the day...

1125
01:04:41,595 --> 01:04:44,593
...and then he's going to be at
the show.

1126
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:51,225
And, I'm having a panic-attack.

1127
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:55,645
I feel like i'm going to cry, throw up
and pass out all at once.

1128
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,981
My breathing is weird.

1129
01:04:58,148 --> 01:04:59,720
I'm going to lose my shit.

1130
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:02,945
And, I'm going to kill him, I'm going
to fucking murder that guy.

1131
01:05:03,105 --> 01:05:05,516
And, it's going to get everybody in
trouble.

1132
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:09,535
We're going to get kicked out of PAX,
a horrible disaster like that.

1133
01:05:10,246 --> 01:05:14,638
I can even begin to figure out
how I'm going to hande this.

1134
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,750
If he doesn't sign, we can't do the
show.

1135
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:23,783
He can. He's going to do his own show,
and prevent me from doing mine.

1136
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,211
It starts today. The show is tomorrow
morning.

1137
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:32,250
We have one day to set everything up.

1138
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,643
And, it's still not signed.

1139
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,183
And, he's coming. He's going to be
there and check out the game.

1140
01:05:39,346 --> 01:05:45,616
And, I'm going to cold-blood fucking
murder him. Fuck that guy! Seriously!

1141
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,910
Have to set-up for the show, while not
even knowing...

1142
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:56,283
...building a booth at the show, while
not even knowing.

1143
01:05:56,488 --> 01:05:58,456
We going to have to fucking
disassemble it.

1144
01:05:58,716 --> 01:06:01,586
We going to have to take apart the FEZ
kiosk.

1145
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:05,215
And, put it away. Build it up. Tear it
down.

1146
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:11,345
Why? Why is he doing this? What's the
point of this?

1147
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:16,111
It just doesn't make any sense.

1148
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,976
He should just fuck off. Let me finish
the game.

1149
01:06:20,316 --> 01:06:24,515
Not interfere in any way because he
stands to gain so much.

1150
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,716
If he just lets me to do my work.

1151
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:30,698
He's going to be a millionaire for
nothing.

1152
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:32,448
He won't have done anything.

1153
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:35,483
He will be fucking millionaire
because of me.

1154
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:42,248
And, somehow he's trying to fucking
sabatoge that. He trying to ruin that.

1155
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:44,283
Or just playing mind games?

1156
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:48,008
What is he stupid or cruel or both?

1157
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:55,513
It's too much.

1158
01:06:56,781 --> 01:06:58,778
There's too much at stake.

1159
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:08,083
I feel like this is just going
to end horribly.

1160
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,236
For everybody involved.

1161
01:07:42,981 --> 01:07:44,980
Where's the remote?
Is the remote over there?

1162
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,983
What the Hell?

1163
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,358
Are you fucking kidding me?

1164
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:07,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

1165
01:08:08,923 --> 01:08:10,048
Where is it?

1166
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:12,383
It's not here.

1167
01:08:20,018 --> 01:08:22,016
What the fuck is that?

1168
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,383
This is fucking bullshit.

1169
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:43,581
We are nothing.
We are nothing to them.

1170
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,416
We're being fucked.

1171
01:08:49,853 --> 01:08:52,850
They don't care. They so don't care.

1172
01:08:54,366 --> 01:08:56,698
We have no....

1173
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:03,880
...we have no placement on the
marketplace...

1174
01:09:04,063 --> 01:09:06,688
...which is the entire point of doing
the sale...

1175
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,315
and doing this stupid promotion.

1176
01:09:08,485 --> 01:09:11,450
And, fucking killing myself to get
this game out in time.

1177
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,850
[Interviewer]
What did they promise you?

1178
01:09:21,818 --> 01:09:24,516
We'd get a spot on the front of
Xbox...

1179
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:27,583
...like all the other shitty games do.

1180
01:09:28,685 --> 01:09:30,983
[Interviewer]
How important is placement?

1181
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:33,255
Pretty fucking important.

1182
01:09:35,283 --> 01:09:37,306
It's like going to the store...

1183
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:39,906
and having to ask if they have game in
the back...

1184
01:09:40,225 --> 01:09:42,431
...because they
don't have it on the shelf.

1185
01:09:43,766 --> 01:09:46,310
You know, how often do people do that.

1186
01:09:55,155 --> 01:09:57,153
I'm not going to look at sales.

1187
01:09:57,365 --> 01:09:59,416
Nah, I'm not going to look at sales.

1188
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,581
There's no point in
looking at sales...

1189
01:10:01,913 --> 01:10:06,485
...because there's no way of me
estimating how it's doing...

1190
01:10:06,876 --> 01:10:08,383
...within the first couple hours.

1191
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:13,338
There's no point in me downloading it
and checking the leaderboards.

1192
01:10:13,633 --> 01:10:18,188
It would freak me out and make me OCD.
I'd just constantly refresh it.

1193
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:21,783
I'll just wait for Microsoft to call.

1194
01:10:23,585 --> 01:10:25,285
That's how you do it.

1195
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:30,115
First day is very very important...

1196
01:10:30,283 --> 01:10:33,850
...because it sort of. It sets. It's
like a pace car.

1197
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:38,106
If you sell 20-30 thousand copies in
the first day....

1198
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:40,818
....well, then you can expect to sort
of staircase down.

1199
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,783
Now that we're going to start
very low...

1200
01:10:42,946 --> 01:10:48,151
...it's going to be the same graph but
just at much smaller scale.

1201
01:10:48,315 --> 01:10:51,083
...and there's just nothing we can do
about it.

1202
01:10:51,603 --> 01:10:53,383
Because the day's half over...

1203
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:56,585
We'll get half of what we had.

1204
01:10:58,218 --> 01:11:02,911
If we have to get on Twitter, and tell
people how to find the game...

1205
01:11:02,913 --> 01:11:06,018
...to buy it. That's awful.

1206
01:11:06,223 --> 01:11:11,050
Especially since, it's not like 'go to
marketplace and we're right there'...

1207
01:11:11,355 --> 01:11:18,236
No, we have say a five-step systems
of events, series of commands...

1208
01:11:18,418 --> 01:11:23,051
...to actually buy the game and that's
awful. That's dumb.

1209
01:11:23,688 --> 01:11:27,035
There's nothing we can do except blame
Microsoft...

1210
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:30,185
and then, never ever work with them
again.

1211
01:11:30,351 --> 01:11:33,623
It's so dumb. I don't want to do
games anymore.

1212
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:37,168
I'll work on cars.

1213
01:11:37,853 --> 01:11:41,818
I don't want to work on cars.
I don't want to do anything.

1214
01:11:42,318 --> 01:11:45,180
Can I be a bum?

1215
01:11:45,473 --> 01:11:52,451
[Four hours into release day, the
game's ad is not on Xbox.]

1216
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:05,315
It's Friday. It's the first day of
PAX.

1217
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:08,218
It's 7:20 in the morning,
right now.

1218
01:12:09,876 --> 01:12:11,385
The show opens at 9.

1219
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,623
Still no signature.

1220
01:12:18,155 --> 01:12:19,451
It's scary.

1221
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:21,685
I really don't like it.

1222
01:12:22,181 --> 01:12:23,351
Everyone is telling me just do it.

1223
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:25,185
And, everything is set-up.

1224
01:12:25,355 --> 01:12:29,318
And, it's not like I'm just going to
say no and stay in my hotel room.

1225
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:32,818
I'm going to tag along and go to the
convention center with everybody...

1226
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:35,318
and do the show.

1227
01:12:40,776 --> 01:12:42,918
Yeah, I guess I'm pretty nervous.

1228
01:12:43,085 --> 01:12:45,793
It's the first time
we've shown the game...

1229
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:48,618
...since we first showed it.

1230
01:12:49,558 --> 01:12:52,851
Pre-success before you ever released
is not a guarantee that...

1231
01:12:53,018 --> 01:12:55,151
...that the world will be there for
you.

1232
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,521
And, the worry I certainly have for
FEZ is that...

1233
01:12:57,688 --> 01:13:00,051
By the time that game ever comes
out...

1234
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,750
...we will have moved on to some other
thing.

1235
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:08,818
I'm hoping that it kind of has a
Phoenix rising moment.

1236
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,118
Like oh yeah, FEZ is back.

1237
01:13:11,288 --> 01:13:13,618
That people will take us a bit more
seriously and...

1238
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,351
...not treat like some vaporware joke.

1239
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,118
Establish that...

1240
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,278
Everything is real.

1241
01:13:35,393 --> 01:13:39,053
Doors are opening in like 5 mins.
There's a million people outside.

1242
01:13:39,486 --> 01:13:41,951
I did release the trailer about an
hour ago.

1243
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,785
It's starting to spread already.

1244
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:47,423
This is real. This is happening now.

1245
01:13:48,221 --> 01:13:50,553
It's out in the open.

1246
01:13:58,193 --> 01:14:01,518
It's really a nerve-wrecking
experience...

1247
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:05,085
....to look at somebody play my
unfinished game.

1248
01:14:06,386 --> 01:14:08,818
Because it's not done.

1249
01:14:09,161 --> 01:14:10,818
Somebody will get stuck somewhere....

1250
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:13,351
...or there's a part they don't get or
they don't like.

1251
01:14:13,885 --> 01:14:16,781
Yeah, but it's not done. I'll fix
it later.

1252
01:14:21,511 --> 01:14:23,451
Yeah, it feels like too...

1253
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:25,551
...too personal.

1254
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,881
It's too close.

1255
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:32,136
Yeah, we'll see what happens.

1256
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:49,518
I think that's a bug.

1257
01:14:49,821 --> 01:14:51,818
I think you're stuck now.

1258
01:14:58,351 --> 01:15:00,998
Yeah, I don't know what that was...

1259
01:15:01,165 --> 01:15:04,983
but he's suppose to keep talking and
then something happens.

1260
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:08,630
If you don't mind starting over.

1261
01:15:11,151 --> 01:15:12,585
First player...

1262
01:15:12,751 --> 01:15:16,650
...game breaking bug right away,
right away.

1263
01:15:18,686 --> 01:15:22,351
Ah, God damn it, it's completely
broken.

1264
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:24,985
That's not good.

1265
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:28,028
Ah, I need to restart this thing.

1266
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:30,715
Keys, keys.

1267
01:15:33,486 --> 01:15:39,185
There's a game breaking right away,
right away. You can't play it.

1268
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,785
The game keeps crashing all the time.
It's completely unstable.

1269
01:15:58,061 --> 01:16:01,391
There are game breaking bugs, right
at the beginning.

1270
01:16:03,186 --> 01:16:04,518
Damn it!

1271
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,985
Even like the 'Start New Game'
doesn't work.

1272
01:16:07,258 --> 01:16:10,685
I need to restart the computer
everytime.

1273
01:16:11,036 --> 01:16:14,351
It's a disaster. It's a complete
fucking disaster.

1274
01:16:18,786 --> 01:16:20,651
What happened? Where were you at?

1275
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:22,830
<i>[PLAYER]
Ah nothing. Just start new game.</i>

1276
01:16:22,998 --> 01:16:24,916
And, it just stayed in the sky.

1277
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:29,795
One moment.

1278
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:33,983
Everytime it crashes it feels like a
personal failure.

1279
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:36,651
Like a deep personal failure.

1280
01:16:37,348 --> 01:16:39,785
I need to actually kill the game and
restart it.

1281
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:43,350
Like I should apologize, 'Sorry I
wasted your time...

1282
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:46,478
...you can start again, if you want'.

1283
01:16:48,653 --> 01:16:50,983
We made too many changes last
night.

1284
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:54,948
And, now we have an unstable build on
our hands.

1285
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:48,418
Someone just sent me sales stats and
we're at 9500 copies

1286
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:52,643
So, 500 hundred more sales and we hit
10 which is considered a success...

1287
01:17:52,843 --> 01:17:58,116
...for first day and it's 2pm.

1288
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,596
[Dancing]

1289
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:07,951
There's a chance we can get between
15-20 thousand sales...

1290
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:11,116
...today, which will be a huge, huge
success...

1291
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,025
...Not record-breaking but still
really amazing.

1292
01:18:14,308 --> 01:18:16,306
[Holy Shit]

1293
01:18:16,478 --> 01:18:19,573
In the past 10 hours, Super Meat Boy
has grossed...

1294
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:23,018
...more than I've made in the past 6
years combined.

1295
01:18:28,486 --> 01:18:30,685
That's a bit interesting.

1296
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,718
I don't know, it's just surreal...

1297
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:48,330
I wish Tommy was here. I wish Tommy
was here.

1298
01:19:04,546 --> 01:19:07,853
Things are going okay.

1299
01:19:08,056 --> 01:19:12,186
The game has alot of game-breaking
bugs and crashes so far...

1300
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:17,020
...and I need to constantly restart,
quit the computer and start it again.

1301
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:22,341
But, people are enjoying it. A lot of
people are playing for 15-20 mins.

1302
01:19:24,015 --> 01:19:27,986
This is really, really a very good
play-test session so far.

1303
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:35,400
I wanted to create a nice place, a
pleasant place to be in.

1304
01:19:36,196 --> 01:19:41,823
I want people to feel a sense of
openness and adventure...

1305
01:19:42,025 --> 01:19:46,051
...but in a really simple, almost
child-like way.

1306
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:13,605
I really want to people to just enter
that world and enjoy their time in it.

1307
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:18,985
That's what the game is. It's a nice
place to spend time in.

1308
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:24,320
I'm trying to recreate that experience
of playing games as a kid...

1309
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:27,486
...before the Internet existed and
hearing these kind of urban legends...

1310
01:20:27,658 --> 01:20:30,686
..."Hey, I hear if you go stand in the
corner for 5 seconds and press down...

1311
01:20:30,858 --> 01:20:33,420
..."and then, you jump two times and
it warps you somewhere."

1312
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:35,420
<i>Yeah, like it was when I started
gaming.</i>

1313
01:20:35,713 --> 01:20:37,253
That's kinda what the game is about.

1314
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:51,765
<i>So nice to see new Fez.</i>

1315
01:20:51,938 --> 01:20:55,353
This is bascially FEZ 4 at this point.
We've scrapped 3 games.

1316
01:20:56,901 --> 01:20:58,320
But I think we got it.

1317
01:20:58,488 --> 01:21:00,318
<i>I love that fucking art.</i>

1318
01:21:02,388 --> 01:21:04,360
Ken just introduced me to Tycho from
Penny Arcade...

1319
01:21:05,953 --> 01:21:08,253
...who was very, very much into the
game.

1320
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:12,915
<i>That is sick as soon as you see the
side of the drum kit...</i>

1321
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,786
<i>Like when you see that pixel art.</i>

1322
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:16,353
You assume, it's pixel art.

1323
01:21:16,628 --> 01:21:18,626
This is a powerful figure in the game
industry.

1324
01:21:18,798 --> 01:21:21,736
He fucking runs this entire
gigantic show!

1325
01:21:24,141 --> 01:21:26,553
I like this part.
Where it's like: Whooooooop

1326
01:21:26,596 --> 01:21:28,928
Now, it's pixel art.

1327
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:31,085
<i>Fuck yes.</i>

1328
01:21:31,256 --> 01:21:32,953
I was really happy to meet the dude...

1329
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,651
...and that he liked my game and me so
much.

1330
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:40,420
I just got a ping back from
Destructoid...

1331
01:21:40,588 --> 01:21:43,186
...who posted about the trailer.

1332
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:47,616
And, only for the post from
Destructoid, that one post...

1333
01:21:47,785 --> 01:21:53,020
...already got 11 thousands 'Likes' on
Facebook and 209 retweets.

1334
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:54,853
<i>Wait, that's in 2 hours.</i>

1335
01:21:55,023 --> 01:21:55,986
In 2 hours.

1336
01:22:05,218 --> 01:22:07,216
But yeah, people enjoy FEZ.

1337
01:22:07,385 --> 01:22:10,220
Almost universally it seems.

1338
01:22:10,386 --> 01:22:11,785
<i>[INTERVIEWER
How does that feel?]</i>

1339
01:22:11,955 --> 01:22:13,020
Feels pretty good.

1340
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,583
<i>What game is this, Brad?</i>

1341
01:22:20,486 --> 01:22:22,751
<i>Super Fuck Fuck.</i>

1342
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,453
This seems like a hardest part.

1343
01:22:29,536 --> 01:22:31,868
What are you supposed to do?

1344
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:35,051
Seeing people play the game is crazy.

1345
01:22:35,256 --> 01:22:38,351
The reviews and stuff we're getting is
really neat but...

1346
01:22:38,525 --> 01:22:40,386
...but seeing people play and hearing
the reactions...

1347
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:45,520
...is so much more beyond that.
It's just so genuine and heartfelt.

1348
01:22:46,255 --> 01:22:49,586
You can hear it their voice
that they enjoy it.

1349
01:22:49,753 --> 01:22:51,353
And, that makes me feel so good.

1350
01:22:51,528 --> 01:22:54,416
<i>If you had one thing to say
to the dude that designed this level?</i>

1351
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:57,620
Fuck you.

1352
01:22:59,823 --> 01:23:02,726
Groan - Why did you hit the spike?

1353
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,050
You're going to feel satisfaction...

1354
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:09,280
or a profound sense of loss...

1355
01:23:09,446 --> 01:23:12,188
...when you finally complete this.

1356
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:22,118
[Sigh] Fucking hell, Dude.

1357
01:23:22,295 --> 01:23:23,718
How are you feeling are you all right?

1358
01:23:24,053 --> 01:23:25,586
Tommy?

1359
01:23:25,798 --> 01:23:27,386
Tommy?

1360
01:23:27,636 --> 01:23:28,188
Uh-huh

1361
01:23:28,358 --> 01:23:29,453
Okay, email from Jon.

1362
01:23:30,155 --> 01:23:32,821
Braid sold 10k the first day.

1363
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:33,720
Oh, cool.

1364
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:36,020
We're closing in on 15k very soon.

1365
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:37,620
That's pretty awesome.

1366
01:23:37,821 --> 01:23:39,820
Hey Tommy,
remember that game Braid?

1367
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,353
Yeah.

1368
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:46,621
I think we might get 20k.
I think we might.

1369
01:23:47,026 --> 01:23:50,188
That means
that on the first day that...

1370
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,320
...we might sell double what one of
the most successful...

1371
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:55,420
...indie games of all-time has sold.

1372
01:23:55,590 --> 01:24:00,873
We're really going
one thousand people an hour.

1373
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,720
Mmm...

1374
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:07,888
It's crazy. You should be very happy
about this Tommy.

1375
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:12,855
I am happy. I'm also very tired.
Very, very tired.

1376
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:15,355
That's fucking crazy.

1377
01:24:15,525 --> 01:24:21,355
15 thousand copies, Tommy.
15 thousand?

1378
01:24:21,525 --> 01:24:24,648
Oh, Tommy, if you want to get even
more happy...

1379
01:24:24,856 --> 01:24:28,188
...go to Youtube, search
Super Meat Boy, look at most recent.

1380
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:33,066
There's one guy that just posted
his 'unwrapping'.

1381
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,455
He wanted to have
an unwrapping of the game.

1382
01:24:35,661 --> 01:24:37,020
So, he went out and bought points.

1383
01:24:37,193 --> 01:24:39,655
It shows him getting the points,
redeeming the points...

1384
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,121
...putting it into the game,
downloading the game.

1385
01:24:42,335 --> 01:24:44,998
Then, it's just him reacting to
playing the game.

1386
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:48,168
[Swearing]

1387
01:24:48,336 --> 01:24:50,255
[Laugh]

1388
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:06,188
Oh my God, oh my God! Ah!

1389
01:25:08,616 --> 01:25:12,521
Love this shirt. Oh so awesome. Yes.

1390
01:25:15,755 --> 01:25:19,155
Regardless of how the game did...

1391
01:25:19,325 --> 01:25:23,855
I would think that I'd like to always
remember that I'm proud of it.

1392
01:25:24,045 --> 01:25:28,170
And, I think it's awesome that I can
look at of video of the game...

1393
01:25:28,388 --> 01:25:29,855
...And still see magic in it.

1394
01:25:30,028 --> 01:25:34,221
Even though, I spent all that time
looking at it....

1395
01:25:34,388 --> 01:25:37,586
....as a buggy piece of software
that I had to fix.

1396
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:41,621
I think it's still awesome that
when I looked at that...

1397
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,988
...Giant Bomb video and it hit the
'Glitch level'...

1398
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:47,185
...that that was the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

1399
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:53,688
What's going on?

1400
01:25:54,055 --> 01:25:57,788
Dude, we got really awesome fan art.
Really awesome fan art.

1401
01:25:57,995 --> 01:25:59,588
This is a really good drawing.

1402
01:25:59,831 --> 01:26:05,186
That's crazy. I used to draw Mario. I
used to draw Mario obsessively.

1403
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:10,288
[Video Review] It's an extraordinary
platformer that makes you work for...

1404
01:26:10,506 --> 01:26:11,721
...every inch you gain.

1405
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,088
It all begins with the controls.

1406
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:16,453
It's apparent that the controls are
just an extension of your thoughts.

1407
01:26:16,623 --> 01:26:18,720
This is an amazingly well designed
game...

1408
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,620
...because it seamlessly avoids the
frustration of dying...

1409
01:26:21,788 --> 01:26:23,855
...by shielding you from your own
aggravation.

1410
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:25,588
You can spend as much time
as you want....

1411
01:26:25,755 --> 01:26:27,355
...getting lost in this incredible
world.

1412
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:30,453
But, the rush of winning, it what
defines this excellent game.

1413
01:26:31,278 --> 01:26:32,288
Video reviews, man.

1414
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,980
What are you doing?

1415
01:26:38,523 --> 01:26:41,521
What are you doing over there?

1416
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:47,453
To see somebody like really get it.

1417
01:26:48,553 --> 01:26:50,255
You look at it,
and think it's effortless...

1418
01:26:50,421 --> 01:26:53,080
Like you just made a game but you
really put everything into it.

1419
01:26:53,346 --> 01:26:57,671
But you knew what you were doing. It's
not easy. Not everybody could do that.

1420
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:01,753
Well, I think people get it.
It's just so crazy.

1421
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,055
It's nice to hear that people get it,
and I have to tell them.

1422
01:27:08,526 --> 01:27:13,155
Yeah, that was an awesome,
an awesome review.

1423
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:18,388
What a fucking crazy year...

1424
01:27:18,615 --> 01:27:20,613
Starting to feel worth it.

1425
01:27:21,855 --> 01:27:23,188
A little.

1426
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:26,521
Starting to feel worth it.

1427
01:27:37,048 --> 01:27:41,091
You want to be liked.
You want to be appreciated.

1428
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:44,521
You want people
to approve of your work.

1429
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:52,206
It's just that you know, you work on a
project so long in semi-secrecy.

1430
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:56,193
You can't really show it. You can that
much, or any feedback really.

1431
01:27:56,700 --> 01:28:00,693
You just want to any little morsel of
appreciation.

1432
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:03,755
Well, I do, anyway.

1433
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:08,451
It's like people "oh, I don't care
what people think about this and that"

1434
01:28:08,626 --> 01:28:12,588
It's like I care what people think.
I wish I didn't. But, I do.

1435
01:28:14,548 --> 01:28:15,586
It's kinda silly.

1436
01:28:16,216 --> 01:28:19,555
I'm a little bit annoyed about how
much I care that stuff.

1437
01:28:19,755 --> 01:28:22,321
Yeah, I wish I didn't care that much.

1438
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:28,726
It is like I need any kind of
love and feedback that I can get.

1439
01:28:29,826 --> 01:28:33,155
Last night,
Destructoid posted about it.

1440
01:28:33,528 --> 01:28:36,055
And, they have the little 'Retweet'
and 'Like' thing.

1441
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:41,946
Its said we had 200 Retweets
and 11 thousand Likes on Facebook.

1442
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:43,948
Oh my god, 11 thousand likes!

1443
01:28:44,121 --> 01:28:48,911
And, that really kind of
gave me a huge boost.

1444
01:28:49,165 --> 01:28:51,790
And, then later I went back to the
hotel and checked it again...

1445
01:28:51,963 --> 01:28:55,293
And, realized that is was a fluke and
actually we had zero 'Likes'.

1446
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,955
Why do I care so much about this? How
many likes I get on a stupid website?

1447
01:29:01,181 --> 01:29:04,050
Why do I let these things affect
me at all?

1448
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:08,423
But, they do. Like I do want to have a
fucking million views on my trailer.

1449
01:29:08,595 --> 01:29:12,018
I want everybody to be talking about
the game.

1450
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:14,895
It can get to you.

1451
01:29:15,318 --> 01:29:16,555
Because it's like...

1452
01:29:16,721 --> 01:29:19,901
...they tell you what you want to hear
basically...

1453
01:29:20,443 --> 01:29:22,321
...well, not what you want to hear
but...

1454
01:29:22,521 --> 01:29:25,440
You know, sometimes I think the game
sucks, and I suck....

1455
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:26,325
...and that it's not going to work.

1456
01:29:26,498 --> 01:29:28,715
Then, this one guy comes along
"yeah this game's stupid....

1457
01:29:28,886 --> 01:29:29,988
...Nothing happens in it".

1458
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,330
And, I'm like, oh Fuck you're right.

1459
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:33,206
Nothing happens in FEZ.

1460
01:29:41,055 --> 01:29:42,800
I don't feel like...

1461
01:29:43,228 --> 01:29:48,653
...as relieved and happy about things
as I wished I was gonna.

1462
01:29:48,828 --> 01:29:51,488
I'm still worried that I might end up
making a shitty game

1463
01:29:51,661 --> 01:29:53,523
That's going to be remembered as
shitty game...

1464
01:29:53,815 --> 01:29:57,438
that was in development for too long,
and end up dissapointing everybody.

1465
01:29:59,788 --> 01:30:01,288
I have news for you, too.

1466
01:30:01,455 --> 01:30:04,521
Hopefully, it will take
a bit of the edge off.

1467
01:30:04,721 --> 01:30:05,453
Hit me.

1468
01:30:06,755 --> 01:30:07,821
We had a meeting.

1469
01:30:07,993 --> 01:30:12,578
We sat down. We talked about all the
grievances, all the issues.

1470
01:30:12,918 --> 01:30:15,321
We agreed, we shook on it and
we came to an understanding....

1471
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:19,420
And, he's going to sign and it's all
going to be taken care of.

1472
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:20,788
Wonderful.

1473
01:30:20,956 --> 01:30:22,888
Yeah? Alright man.

1474
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,178
It isn't signed, yet. But, it's huge
weight lifted off my shoulders.

1475
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:33,716
Like I can breath easier.

1476
01:30:42,595 --> 01:30:44,590
[INTERVIEWER]
I'm getting a Knytt Stories vibe.

1477
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:45,656
Yes!

1478
01:30:45,826 --> 01:30:47,355
[INTERVIEWER]
A bit of Cave Story.

1479
01:30:47,523 --> 01:30:48,156
No!

1480
01:30:48,388 --> 01:30:51,988
No, Cave Story, I meant say.
Why does he wear a little Fez hat?

1481
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:55,121
Because that's where
he get his 3D power from.

1482
01:30:55,293 --> 01:30:56,748
Because the Fez is a cube.

1483
01:30:57,321 --> 01:31:01,751
Well, that's it really.
That's my logic for that.

1484
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,523
Did I see the entirity of the
mechanic?

1485
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:09,923
Basically, you don't get
anymore more powers than that.

1486
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:12,690
There's no boss fights,
or penalties for dying....

1487
01:31:12,938 --> 01:31:16,490
So, it's meant to be played slowly and
carefully like enjoy the world.

1488
01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:21,455
It's stop and smell the flowers
kind of game.

1489
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:23,816
When I explained to people what the
game was about...

1490
01:31:23,988 --> 01:31:28,190
...and how it was slow and passive and
relaxing...

1491
01:31:28,368 --> 01:31:31,788
...alot of people understood what I
was going for with that.

1492
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,995
People enjoyed what we showed them....

1493
01:31:36,173 --> 01:31:39,518
...which is just the beginning of game
that we've been polishing like crazy.

1494
01:31:39,696 --> 01:31:42,956
The game is still not done. It's still
not a cohesive whole.

1495
01:31:43,301 --> 01:31:44,420
I still have a lot of work to do.

1496
01:31:44,591 --> 01:31:49,990
So I can't just like, take it all
to the bank, right now.

1497
01:31:50,163 --> 01:31:53,056
I can't just like "Oh yeah, I did
great job. FEZ is fantastic."

1498
01:31:54,261 --> 01:31:57,905
I need to still
be afraid of failure, I think.

1499
01:32:21,871 --> 01:32:23,986
The game came out.

1500
01:32:25,463 --> 01:32:27,253
It was ...

1501
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:30,631
... highly praised in the press.

1502
01:32:31,135 --> 01:32:34,760
We got interviewed
by the Wall Street Journal.

1503
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:41,016
It got the second highest
'Metacritic' score of all time...

1504
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:42,601
... on Xbox Live.

1505
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:46,920
And we sold 22,000 copies of the game.

1506
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:50,453
Yep.

1507
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:53,655
I feel like, I actually...

1508
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:57,408
... for the first time in my whole
career...

1509
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:04,623
I successfully did something that...

1510
01:33:05,211 --> 01:33:08,461
...a majority of people liked.

1511
01:33:08,631 --> 01:33:11,548
It wasn't an alienating experience.

1512
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:18,305
I'm notorious for making games that...

1513
01:33:18,475 --> 01:33:20,306
...tend to alienate.

1514
01:33:20,478 --> 01:33:23,893
Or not everybody completely
understands.

1515
01:33:24,063 --> 01:33:25,891
And to make something that seems to
have...

1516
01:33:26,063 --> 01:33:28,728
...complete universal praise.

1517
01:33:29,691 --> 01:33:31,690
I can't help but think that...

1518
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:33,801
I finally made something...

1519
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:35,818
... good.

1520
01:33:36,593 --> 01:33:41,621
Like, I know there's a kid out there.

1521
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:45,055
Who stayed up all night long.

1522
01:33:45,223 --> 01:33:46,855
For the game to come out.

1523
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:50,688
And didn't go to school the next day.
Because he was so into playing it.

1524
01:33:50,856 --> 01:33:54,826
And that even exceeds my experiences
when I was younger.

1525
01:33:54,995 --> 01:33:57,760
And to think that I could make
something that could...

1526
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:00,471
... have an impact on this kid,
even creatively into thinking:

1527
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:05,103
<i>Hey, I know two guys made this.
Maybe I can make something too?</i>

1528
01:34:09,356 --> 01:34:11,525
It's just cool.

1529
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:17,023
It's really cool.

1530
01:34:18,191 --> 01:34:20,186
It feels really really good.

1531
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:54,191
Part of it...

1532
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:56,208
... is about not trying to be ...

1533
01:34:56,378 --> 01:34:57,191
... professional.

1534
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:01,255
A lot of people come into indie games,
trying to be like a big company.

1535
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:03,241
What those game companies do...

1536
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:05,786
...is create highly polished things...

1537
01:35:05,956 --> 01:35:08,685
...that serve as large an audience
as possible.

1538
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:15,416
The way that you do that is by...

1539
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:17,483
...filing off all the bumps
on something.

1540
01:35:17,651 --> 01:35:19,540
If there's a sharp corner.

1541
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:22,126
You make sure that's not going
to hurt anybody.

1542
01:35:22,295 --> 01:35:26,600
That creation of this highly glossy,
commercial product...

1543
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:29,266
... is the opposite
of making something personal.

1544
01:35:37,456 --> 01:35:40,405
Things that are personal have flaws.

1545
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:42,415
They have vulnerabilities.

1546
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:45,158
If you don't see a vulnerability
in somebody.

1547
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:48,246
You're probably not relating to them
on a very personal level.

1548
01:35:50,901 --> 01:35:53,155
<i>[He has no plans to delay.]</i>

1549
01:35:53,323 --> 01:35:55,628
So it's the same with a game design.

1550
01:35:59,343 --> 01:36:01,635
Making it, was about:

1551
01:36:01,805 --> 01:36:03,651
Let me take my deepest
flaws and vulnerabilities ...

1552
01:36:03,821 --> 01:36:06,678
and put them in the game.

1553
01:36:06,851 --> 01:36:11,936
and let's see what happens.
