1
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,624
Away with it!
- Don't be difficult!

2
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,790
Let's take
our lovely children on an outing !

3
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,249
You can't do this. I know my rights.

4
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,457
I have the authority
to close you down .

5
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,749
This exhibit degrades those who see it
and the poor creature himself.

6
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,457
He is a freak. How else will he live?

7
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,457
This is entirely different!

8
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,790
This is monstrous
and should not be allowed !

9
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,749
These officers will see
that you are on your way. Good day!

10
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,790
Move along please !

11
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:42,040
Hold it there, sir. Come this way.

12
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,207
On the move again . . .

13
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,665
My treasure.

14
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,082
We're seeing a lot more
of these machine accidents.

15
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:53,582
Abominable things these machines.
You can't reason with them .

16
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,999
What a mess.

17
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,040
Pull on the rope !

18
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,124
Irons, please !

19
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,374
Who is it?

20
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,832
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

21
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,874
I found it.
- Good . Did you see it?

22
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,624
No.
- Alright.

23
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,374
l'll see you in a moment. Thank you .

24
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,332
Who's that?
- A friend of mine.

25
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,624
Oh yes?

26
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,999
What are you up to?
- Nothing .

27
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,624
Oh , come on !

28
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,957
Nothing of any importance.

29
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,749
Where's Green Street, please?

30
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,957
Second on the left, then right.
- Thanks.

31
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,624
Are you the proprietor?
- And who might you be, sir?

32
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,624
Just one of the curious.
l'd like to see it.

33
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,665
l don't think so, we're . . .

34
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:33,915
closed !
- l'd pay handsomely for a showing .

35
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,290
Are you the proprietor?
- Handsomely?. Who sent you?

36
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,957
I beg your pardon?
- Never mind .

37
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,957
l'm the owner.

38
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,040
Life . . .

39
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,874
is full of surprises.

40
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,499
Consider the fate

41
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,457
of this creature's poor mother,

42
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,207
struck down . . .

43
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,624
in the fourth month
of her condition by wild elephants.

44
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,790
Struck down . . .

45
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:44,457
on an uncharted African isle.

46
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,332
The result . . .

47
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,499
is plain to see.

48
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,457
Ladies and Gentlemen ,

49
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,790
the terrible . . .

50
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,915
Elephant Man !

51
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,540
Stand up !
- Stand up !

52
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,874
Turn around !
- Turn around !

53
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,957
You'll bring him to me
tomorrow, ten o'clock, Mr. . . .?

54
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,082
Bytes. He'll be there.

55
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:31,290
Here is my card . l'll send a cab.

56
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,415
We have a deal.

57
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,415
We understand each other,

58
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,957
more than money has changed hands.

59
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,665
We understand each other
completely, my friend .

60
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,624
Yes. Thank you , Mr. Bytes.

61
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,290
Cor, what a stink!

62
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,082
l'm looking for Mr. Frederick Treves.

63
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,915
Please, ma'am .

64
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,915
l'll send for him . Nurse !

65
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,290
Mr. Treves, this . . .

66
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,957
Yes.
- Says, that . . .

67
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,457
Yes, I was expecting him .

68
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,957
Are you the cab driver? - Yes.
- Anyone else with you?

69
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,999
No, just this gentleman .
- Thank you for your troubles.

70
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,707
Not at all. My pleasure.
- Thank you .

71
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,124
This way, please?

72
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,540
l'll be in my room
and l'm not to be disturbed .

73
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,040
Of course, sir.

74
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,915
Will you come with me?

75
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,624
You heard the doctor?

76
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,332
Go on !

77
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:16,957
My name is Frederick Treves and l'm
the surgeon at the London Hospital.

78
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,415
And . . .

79
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,415
I lecture in anatomy
at the medical college.

80
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,332
Sorry.

81
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,624
l'd like very much to examine you .

82
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,915
Would that be alright?

83
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,999
Please.

84
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,707
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

85
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,290
Would that be alright?

86
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,665
Your owner . . .The man ,
who looks after you , tells me that . . .

87
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,832
you're English
and that your name is John Merrick.

88
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,374
John Merrick, is that right?

89
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,082
I tell you what,
I think l'll ask you a question

90
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,040
and you shake you head for 'no'.

91
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,624
Have you always been this way?

92
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,665
Are you in any pain?

93
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,790
Are your parents still alive?

94
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:35,790
Do you understand me? Your father,
your mother, are they dead?

95
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,082
Freddie, what are you doing . . .?

96
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,957
Oh , l'm sorry. I had no idea . . .

97
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,624
What have you got there?
- You'll find out at the meeting .

98
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,624
Until then , not a word to anyone.

99
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,999
Alright.
You must have quite a find in there.

100
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,249
I don't know.
- "Nothing of any importance", eh?

101
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,457
Not a word , please, Fox.

102
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,499
Alright.

103
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,332
I think l'll examine you now.

104
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,499
l'll leave the questions till later.

105
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,290
Will you take your hat off?

106
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,582
Don't be frightened .
I simply want to look at you .

107
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,665
Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened .

108
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,082
Thank you . Good afternoon .

109
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,624
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers !

110
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,957
Pull the curtains aside !

111
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:59,415
He's English . He is 2 1 years of age.

112
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,749
His name is John Merrick.

113
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,374
In the course
of my profession I have come upon

114
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:11,582
many deformities of the face
due to injury or disease

115
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:16,790
as well as mutilations and contortions
of the body from like causes.

116
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:22,040
I have never seen such a perverted ,
degraded version of a human being .

117
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,957
I wish to draw your attention to
his insidious conditions.

118
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,040
Can you see over there?

119
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,957
Note, if you will,
the extreme enlargement of the skull

120
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,415
and the limb, which is useless,

121
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,499
the alarming curvature of the spine.
Would you turn round , please?

122
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,457
Turn round , please !

123
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,290
The looseness of the skin

124
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:51,165
and the fibrous tumours
that cover 90%  of the body.

125
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,790
There is every indication that these
afflictions have existed and have

126
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,957
progressed rapidly since birth .

127
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,624
He suffers from chronic bronchitis.

128
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:05,790
Interesting side note:
Despite these anomalies

129
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:11,040
the patient's genitals
remain entirely intact and unaffected .

130
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,374
Thank you .

131
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:19,124
And his left arm
is perfectly normal, as you see.

132
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,665
So gentlemen ,

133
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:26,332
owing to the
congenital exostosis of the skull,

134
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:29,957
extensive papillomatous growths,
pendulous masses of skin ,

135
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:33,457
the enlargement of
the right limb and all the bones,

136
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,749
the distortion of the head
and the extensive area

137
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,790
covered by papillomatous growth ,

138
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,582
The patient
has been called the "Elephant Man".

139
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,624
Thank you .

140
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,290
You haven't
mentioned his mental state.

141
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:20,832
He's an imbecile, probably from birth .
A complete idiot.

142
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,540
Pray to God he is.

143
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,457
Where have you been?

144
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,165
Out!

145
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,957
How can I eat with a noise like that?

146
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,290
Bytes, don't!

147
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,457
Where were you? What did you do?

148
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,457
Our man is sick. Come right away!
- What is it?

149
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,249
Like this . . .

150
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,790
What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night!

151
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,457
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him !

152
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,790
Yes, I intend to.

153
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,790
What happened?
- He had a fall. He falls.

154
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,624
Looks like a very severe fall.

155
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,582
He's a . . .

156
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,499
. . . clumsy soul.

157
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,457
Never looks where he's going .
But that's alright.

158
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,915
He has me to take care of him .

159
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,082
Why is he sitting up? He needs rest!

160
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,249
That's how he sleeps.

161
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:31,957
lf he lies down , he'll kill himself.

162
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,624
His head's too big .

163
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,290
This man belongs in the hospital.

164
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,957
Can't you treat him here?
Listen , he's my livelihood .

165
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:48,582
We're business partners, he and I.

166
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:55,124
He's the greatest freak in the world !
- Now, you listen .

167
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:59,999
You're not going to have a livelihood
if he dies. Go and fetch a cab !

168
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,624
I truly appreciate this, my friend .

169
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,749
Listen ,

170
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,290
there's much I can do for you .

171
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:14,415
I move in the proper circles.

172
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:19,707
In fact, anything at all,
if you take my meaning .

173
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:25,582
Everything will be taken care of.
- Good to do business with you .

174
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,790
Can I have a bowl of oatmeal?

175
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:20,165
Breakfasting with the patients?
- lt's for a patient.

176
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,124
There you are.

177
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,749
Thank you . Good morning .
- Morning .

178
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,415
Come here a moment!

179
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,082
What's that you've got there?

180
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:49,832
Good Heavens ! You haven't acquired
a taste for this stuff?

181
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,124
Yes, it's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.

182
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,957
Not quite the diet for
a grown man . Nurse !

183
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:03,249
Just take this to the patient
in the isolation ward , will you?

184
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:05,957
Yes, sir.

185
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,832
Don't be frightened .
He won't hurt you .

186
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:16,457
Won't he indeed . Just a moment!
There's something I want to say.

187
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:23,040
A hospital's no place for secrecy.

188
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:27,457
Doctors spiriting hooded figures
around cause comment.

189
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,624
Why wasn't he properly admitted?
Why the isolation ward?

190
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:36,124
He's not contagious, is he?
- No, he's got chronic bronchitis

191
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,582
and he's been beaten .
- Why not the General Ward?

192
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:44,165
He's seriously deformed .

193
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,124
I fear it could shock the patients.

194
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:52,707
Deformed , is that it?
ls he ultimately incurable?

195
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,040
Yes, sir.
- But you must be aware,

196
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:59,290
that this hospital
doesn't accept incurables.

197
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:04,124
l'm aware of that.
But this case is quite exceptional.

198
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,290
I quite appreciate your problem .

199
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:32,790
Why not contact
the Royal Hospital for Incurables?

200
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,707
Perhaps they might find him a place.
- Yes. Would you like to meet him?

201
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:55,957
Excuse me !

202
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,165
The Elephant Man .

203
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,874
Sorry.

204
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,082
I should have warned you .

205
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:20,457
Please forgive me. You alright?

206
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,249
Please send Mrs. Mothershead up here.

207
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:30,124
Tell her to knock and wait for me.

208
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,790
l'm sorry about that.

209
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:49,624
We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

210
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:56,165
You'll be comfortable here.
l'll see you get everything you need .

211
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:19,457
Blimey!

212
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,790
So, this is the Elephant Man .

213
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:33,249
I ain't seen nothing like you before.

214
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,290
What the hell happened to you?

215
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,624
Dumb, eh?

216
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,957
I like people that can keep quiet.

217
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,582
Here, have a drink!

218
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,415
Go on ! No?

219
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,457
You should be more sociable.

220
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,957
Get yourself disliked .

221
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,957
We're going to be good friends and
my friends will want to meet you .

222
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:27,124
And they will, believe me.

223
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:41,540
l've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

224
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,790
Come up on the bed .

225
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,040
Come on !

226
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:24,624
All he understands is a good smack.
- He's had his share of smacks.

227
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,457
That drives him under the bed .
Treat him with kindness and patience.

228
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:33,249
Perhaps you've
got time for that sort of treatment.

229
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:38,624
l've got a hospital to run .
Don't you waste your time, with him .

230
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,290
lt's like talking to a brick wall.

231
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:46,457
I don't mean to be harsh ,

232
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,790
but he doesn't belong here.

233
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:57,040
Honestly, sir,
what can you do for him?

234
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:13,290
By the way, Mr. Carr-Gomm said

235
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:15,957
he'd like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

236
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,499
Yes.
- Thank you .

237
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:26,790
I can't help you , unless you help me.

238
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,790
I believe there's something
you want to say to me.

239
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,499
Something back there.

240
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:45,040
I can't help you , unless you help me !

241
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:50,915
I believe you want to say something .

242
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:55,457
l've got to understand
what you're feeling and thinking .

243
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,165
Do you understand me?

244
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,832
Just nod your head .
Can you understand me?

245
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,957
Nod your head if you understand me.

246
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,249
Alright.

247
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,290
You do understand .

248
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:23,832
I want to hear you talk.
You are not a wall.

249
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,624
Do you understand?
I want you to talk to me.

250
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,374
Now. I want to hear you say it.

251
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:37,040
I want to hear how you say things.
l'm not going to hurt you .

252
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:38,790
Got to hear!

253
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:43,374
Very slowly, I want you to say "yes".

254
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:46,165
Say "yes".

255
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,290
<i>Y es</i>

256
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,415
Yes !

257
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:58,165
Alright.

258
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,124
Now just once more: "yes".

259
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,415
I can understand that. That's good !

260
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,165
That's very good . Alright now

261
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:18,582
l'm going to say some words to you
and you repeat them . Understand?

262
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:22,957
Say "Hello, my name is . . ."

263
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:28,749
Hello.

264
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,957
My name is . . .

265
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:38,415
John Merrick.

266
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,957
John , that's very good .
Say "John Merrick".

267
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,374
Merrick.

268
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:52,582
"Hello, my name is John Merrick".

269
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:58,124
Hello, my name is . . .

270
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,165
. . . is John Merrick.

271
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,374
You can speak!

272
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:15,040
How did you get up here?

273
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:18,290
I want my man back.
- Just a moment.

274
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,290
Never mind . I want my man .

275
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:26,707
He's still very sick.
Come downstairs and l'll explain .

276
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,124
No !

277
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,957
Don't.

278
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:37,290
You've had plenty of time to cure him .

279
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,790
And now he's leaving with me.

280
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,957
Do you understand me?

281
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,374
Now, Mr. Treves.

282
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:49,957
We made a deal.
- You misunderstood .

283
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:54,749
This man has suffered a severe fall.
lf you take my meaning .

284
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,707
He is my patient now.
- Pull the other one !

285
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:03,290
l'm sorry. But all you do is profit
from another man's misery.

286
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,374
Do you think you are better than me?
- No.

287
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:12,290
You wanted the freak

288
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,624
to show your doctor chums,
make a name for yourself.

289
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,624
You , my friend . . .

290
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,790
I gave you the freak . . . on trust.

291
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,457
In the name of science.

292
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:32,624
And now I want him back!
- You do not own this man . Stop it!

293
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,249
I want him back!
- So you can beat him?

294
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:40,082
So you can starve him?
A dog in the street would fare better.

295
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:43,124
l'll go to the authorities.
- Go to them , then !

296
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,457
By all means.

297
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,957
They'll be interested
to hear your story and ours.

298
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:53,957
Now, I think

299
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:57,124
we really understand one another.

300
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,249
Alright.

301
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:20,499
A singularly unattractive character!

302
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,874
lt seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

303
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,415
Thank you very much .

304
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,290
Shall we say in a few days?

305
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:36,624
Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?

306
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:43,582
Whatever's most convenient, sir.

307
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,040
Two o'clock then , tomorrow.

308
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,124
Thank you very much .

309
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,290
Two o'clock . . .

310
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:01,082
Morning , Mr Treves. Early again !
- Yes.

311
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,499
You'd have made a good milkman !

312
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,957
l'll keep that in mind .
- Okay, sir.

313
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:19,290
"He restoreth my soul.

314
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:24,374
He leadeth me into paths of . . .
righteousness for his name's sake."

315
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:26,707
"Righteousness ! "

316
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:33,082
"He leadeth me into the paths of

317
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:36,790
righteousness for his name's sake."

318
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,957
Good . lt's very good .

319
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,290
When your visitor comes today,
I want you to say it exactly the same.

320
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:49,124
When I introduce him to you ,
just say the words you've learnt.

321
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,957
lf you have trouble with the words,
l'll help you , nothing to worry about.

322
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:57,957
l'll introduce you to him and say:
"Please meet Mr. Carr-Gomm ."

323
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,040
And you will say:

324
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:05,124
Hello, my name is John Merrick.

325
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,374
l'm very pleased to meet you .

326
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:11,457
Good . Good .

327
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:14,165
l'll go and get Mr. Carr-Gomm .

328
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:23,957
lt is only a physical problem .

329
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:29,290
He has trouble with certain sounds
because of the constrictive deformity.

330
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:34,415
But he can talk.
- ls he able to understand?

331
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,290
Yes. Oh , yes.

332
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:43,957
Except he's so anxious to make a good
impression , that he might be nervous.

333
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,957
Come in !

334
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,124
May I introduce you to Mr. Carr-Gomm?

335
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:26,957
This is John Merrick.
- Hello.

336
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:31,249
My name is John Merrick.
l'm very pleased to meet you .

337
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,790
l'm very pleased to meet you .

338
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:41,124
How are you feeling today?
- I feel much better.

339
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,249
Are you comfortable here?

340
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:50,457
Everybody's very kind .

341
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,582
How is your bronchitis?

342
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,124
Mr. Merrick likes
the food here, don't you?

343
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:17,749
Much better than what l'm used to.
- Oh yes?

344
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,124
And what was that?

345
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:25,415
Potatoes.

346
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,165
You were flogged?

347
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:35,957
I feel much better now.

348
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:40,124
Splendid .
How do you find Mr. Treves

349
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,707
as a teacher, I mean?

350
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:52,874
Very kind .

351
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:59,790
How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

352
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:09,624
Very kind .

353
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:15,707
I understand .
lt's been a pleasure meeting you .

354
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:17,207
Good day.

355
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:30,457
lt was very good , John .

356
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,457
l'll be back in a moment.

357
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:39,790
"The Lord is my shepherd ,

358
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:43,957
I shall not want.

359
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,790
He maketh me lie down . . ."

360
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:51,374
A brave attempt but he simply
mouthed words taught by you .

361
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,707
l'm sorry to have wasted your time.

362
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,415
"He restoreth my soul."

363
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:03,499
He simply doesn't belong here.
He should be constantly looked after.

364
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,624
l'm sorry, things have
turned out this way. Good day.

365
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:08,207
<i>Y es</i>

366
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:14,915
"Though I walked through the valley of
the shadow of death , I fear no evil,

367
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:19,707
for Thou art with me,
Thy rod and Thy staff . . ."

368
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,832
Mr. Carr-Gomm !

369
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,249
What is it?

370
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,499
lt's that!

371
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:33,290
I didn't teach him that part!

372
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:40,957
"Goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life

373
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:46,624
and I shall dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

374
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,290
How did you know the rest of it?
- Very strange.

375
00:50:56,791 --> 00:51:00,374
How did you know
the rest of the 23rd Psalm?

376
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:10,749
I used to read the Bible every day.

377
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:16,457
I know it very well
and the Book of Common Prayer.

378
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:21,957
The 23rd Psalm's beautiful.
lt's my favourite.

379
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,457
Come and see me in my office
when you're through .

380
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:30,249
There's something
important I want to say.

381
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,957
Goodbye.
I do hope we shall meet again .

382
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:48,749
Why didn't you tell me you can read?

383
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:51,415
I was frightened .

384
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:58,832
I see.
- I was afraid to talk.

385
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:04,915
Please forgive me.

386
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:20,332
Can you imagine the life he must
have had? - Yes, I think I can .

387
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:25,790
I don't believe so.
I don't believe any of us can .

388
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:43,249
Terrible though his appearance is,
so terrible, that nervous persons

389
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,749
fly in horror from the sight of him ,

390
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:51,957
and that he is debarred from
earning his livelihood in any way.

391
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:56,374
Yet he is superior in intelligence.
He can read and write,

392
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,915
is quiet, gentle,
not to say even refined .

393
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,707
I should like to meet this gentleman .

394
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,290
Have you seen this?
- No.

395
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:53,790
Listen to this !
- Hey up, hey up !

396
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:55,124
Hey up !

397
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:01,082
Listen ! This is a letter

398
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:05,874
to the London Times
from the governor of the hospital.

399
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:11,540
In a little room in one of attic wards
is a man named John Merrick,

400
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:17,624
so dreadful a sight, that he is
unable even to come out by day.

401
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:23,207
He's been called the "Elephant Man"
on account of his terrible deformity.

402
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:28,540
His appearance is so terrible,
that women and nervous persons

403
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,957
fly in terror at the sight of him .

404
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,624
And how do you get tickets to see him?

405
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:40,082
Your very own Sunny Jim !
- Let's go and see him !

406
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:43,540
Keep your shirt on .
The time must be right.

407
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:51,124
Now he's in the attic, but tomorrow
they'll move him to Bedstead Square,

408
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:56,540
right into my lap.
Then , for the right price

409
00:54:56,666 --> 00:55:02,290
you'll see something you'll
never ever see again in your life !

410
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:56,124
Don't look so glum girls !
Volunteers should be more cheerful !

411
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:59,790
Put your collar straight, girl !

412
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:02,290
And remember

413
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:07,290
that under no circumstances whatsoever

414
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,790
are any mirrors to be brought here.
- Yes, Mrs. Mothershead .

415
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:15,624
Yes, Mrs. Mothershead .
- Yes.

416
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,457
Right.

417
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:27,749
He's so ugly!
- Well, ugly or not, help me !

418
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,290
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

419
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:38,707
<i>Y es</i>

420
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:42,624
You look nice in your new clothes.

421
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:47,707
Thank you very much .
- Well, if there's nothing else,

422
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51,790
we'll be leaving you now.
- No, there's nothing .

423
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:24,124
Ready for tea?

424
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,374
Please go in , John .

425
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,040
Make yourself comfortable.

426
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,624
Anne, come and meet our guest.

427
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:03,957
l'd like you to meet my wife, Anne.

428
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:06,624
Anne, this is John Merrick.

429
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,415
l'm very pleased to meet you .

430
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:18,874
I . . .

431
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,624
l'm very pleased .

432
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:31,124
What is it? What's the matter?

433
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,249
lt's just that I . . .

434
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,290
l'm not used

435
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:43,374
to being treated so well

436
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,457
by so beautiful a woman .

437
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:54,957
Would you like a cup of tea?
- That's a good idea.

438
00:58:57,458 --> 00:59:01,082
Come and see the rest of the house !

439
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,624
How's your tea?

440
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,415
Very good .

441
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:27,290
l'm enjoying my visit very much .

442
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,124
lt's very kind of you
to invite me to your home.

443
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:41,790
l'm sorry
that I made a spectacle of myself.

444
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,790
No, not at all.

445
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:51,290
I love the way

446
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,082
you've arranged the pictures.
- Oh , thank you .

447
00:59:57,208 --> 01:00:00,124
ls that the way in most houses?

448
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,082
Yes, l'm sure it is.

449
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,624
Who are they of?

450
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:10,582
These are relatives
and these are our children .

451
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,790
Children? May I see?

452
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:15,582
Yes, of course.

453
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:25,582
Where are the children?

454
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,499
They're out with friends.

455
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:33,415
Friends . . .

456
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,332
Here is Frederick's mother.

457
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,582
And these are my parents.

458
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:56,290
They have such noble faces.

459
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,249
Yes, l've always thought so myself.

460
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:05,040
Would you . . .

461
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:09,124
care to see my mother?

462
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,915
Your mother?

463
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,832
Yes, please.

464
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,249
Oh , but she's . . .

465
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,665
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful !

466
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:30,457
She has . . .

467
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:34,832
She has the face of an angel.

468
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,040
I must . . .

469
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:52,249
I must have been
a great disappointment to her.

470
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,832
No, Mr. Merrick, no.

471
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:58,874
No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

472
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:04,332
lf only I could find her!

473
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:11,457
lf she could see me
with such lovely friends,

474
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:14,832
perhaps she could love me as I am .

475
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:21,707
l've tried so hard to be good .

476
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,582
l'm so sorry.

477
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,665
Sorry.
- Please !

478
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,082
l'm so sorry.

479
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,374
Please !

480
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,790
What's that you're doing?

481
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,582
What is it?

482
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:29,082
Oh , I see ! St. Philip's !

483
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:34,374
Why, it's very good !
You've got the windows just right!

484
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,124
I wish

485
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,457
I could sleep

486
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,957
like normal people.

487
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,749
Mr. Treves,

488
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:14,915
there's something
l've been meaning to ask you

489
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:18,457
for some time now.
- What's that?

490
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,332
Can you cure me?

491
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:24,374
No.

492
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:31,415
No. We can care for you ,
but we can't cure you .

493
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:34,499
No.

494
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:37,499
I thought not.

495
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,290
Come in .

496
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:52,624
Good morning !

497
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:58,874
Good morning .
- Someone would like to meet you .

498
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:03,624
May I introduce you to one of the
bright lights of the English stage?

499
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:06,374
Mrs. Kendal, this is John Merrick.

500
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:11,540
Good day!
- Good day.

501
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,540
l've brought you some things.
I hope you like them .

502
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:20,499
I hope you don't think it too forward?
- Oh , no.

503
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:25,415
I knew you'd understand .
- l'll leave you together.

504
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,582
Here.

505
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:35,915
I want you to know I don't give
my pictures to just anyone.

506
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:39,749
No, I wouldn't think of it.

507
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,790
lt's beautiful. You're so . . .

508
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:49,707
l'll put it . . .

509
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:53,957
in a place of honour.

510
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,957
Next to my mother.

511
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:09,290
She's very pretty, your mother.
- Yes.

512
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:26,165
You're constructing a. . . church?

513
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:32,082
No. lt's a cathedral.

514
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:33,624
Do you see?

515
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:39,957
I have to rely on my imagination ,

516
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:44,457
for what I can't actually see.

517
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:59,582
Mr. Treves tells me
you're in the theatre.

518
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:04,749
Do you live there?
- Oh no, I just work there.

519
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:11,415
lt must be wonderful to work there.

520
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:14,957
ls it beautiful?
- You've never been?

521
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:17,707
l'm afraid not.

522
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:22,457
You must go ! The theatre is
the most beautiful place on earth !

523
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:25,624
Of course I am a bit partial.

524
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:29,374
The theatre is romance.

525
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,874
Romance?

526
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:35,707
Oh yes . . .

527
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:40,832
l've brought you something else !

528
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,957
Thank you .
- Have you read it?

529
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:53,832
No, but I certainly shall.

530
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:06,082
"Romeo and Juliet" !

531
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,957
Yes, l've heard of this.

532
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:17,457
"lf I profane with my unworthiest hand

533
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:23,165
this holy shrine,
the gentle fine is this:

534
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:28,665
Thy lips, two blushing pilgrims,

535
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:37,374
ready stand , to smooth that
rough touch with a tender kiss."

536
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:42,832
"Good Pilgrim ,
you do wrong your hand too much ,

537
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:45,415
which mannerly devotion show in this.

538
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:49,624
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch .

539
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,957
And palm to palm's
holy Palmer's kiss."

540
01:08:53,833 --> 01:09:00,040
"Oh then , dear Saint,
let lips do what hands do.

541
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:06,957
They pray, grant thou
lest faith turn to despair."

542
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:12,707
"Saints do not move,
though grant for prayer's sake."

543
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:21,207
"Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

544
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:27,290
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged ."

545
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,624
And then it says: they kiss.

546
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,415
"Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

547
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:49,915
"Sin from my lips?

548
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:54,082
O trespass, sweetly urg'd .

549
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,165
Give me my sin again ."

550
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:07,749
You're not an Elephant Man at all.

551
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:11,374
No?

552
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:15,624
No. You're Romeo.

553
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:27,290
"Mrs. Kendal,
always at the forefront of fashion ,

554
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:30,415
was seen leaving
"The London" the other afternoon .

555
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:34,582
No, dear readers,
the actress has not been taken ill,

556
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:40,624
but said she was visiting a friend .
Who was the lucky recipient?

557
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:45,124
Enquiries proved it to be none other
than John Merrick, the Elephant Man ,

558
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:48,582
with whom our readers are familiar.

559
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:54,874
After a chat of 45 minutes, she left
him with an autographed portrait."

560
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,790
I saw it in his room .

561
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:01,165
"Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature,

562
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:05,457
Mr. Merrick has never been
presented to London society.

563
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:10,415
But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal
goes, other inevitably follow,

564
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:15,040
the question arises - will London
society present itself to him?"

565
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:19,624
This walking stick is so dashing !

566
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,957
And more elegant than my old one !

567
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,290
More tea?

568
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,624
I don't go out
as often as I would like,

569
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:43,457
because naturally people find
my appearance disturbing .

570
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:46,290
lf you have a chill
I could close the window.

571
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,457
No, l'm fine, please . . .

572
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:53,707
Thank you .

573
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,707
You see,

574
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:03,499
people are frightened
by what they don't understand .

575
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:10,832
And it is hard to understand ,
even for me because my mother

576
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,832
was so very beautiful !

577
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:28,082
No more visitors today.

578
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,582
l've got a lecture. Till this evening !
- Excuse me, sir,

579
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:35,040
I would like a word with you .
- What is it?

580
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:39,082
I don't quite understand

581
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,790
why you allow people in there.

582
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,790
He enjoys it and it's good for him .

583
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:50,249
But you saw the expression on their
faces, they didn't hide their disgust!

584
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:54,415
They don't care about John .
They want to impress their friends.

585
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:58,582
I think you're being rather harsh .
- I beg your pardon .

586
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,582
You hardly showed him much kindness
when he first arrived , did you?

587
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:06,499
I bathed him , I fed him
and I cleaned up after him !

588
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:09,207
And my nurses do the same.

589
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:16,540
lf "kindness" can be called care

590
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,999
then I did show him loving kindness !

591
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:23,290
I didn't mean it exactly that way.

592
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:27,624
I appreciate your concern
and everything you've done for him .

593
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:31,374
But I am the physician
and must do what's best for him .

594
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:35,915
Please now, l'm very late.
- lf you ask my opinion ,

595
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:40,832
he's only being stared at again !
- Thank you .

596
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,374
Night time !

597
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:58,082
Freddie !

598
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,207
What's the matter?

599
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:09,790
l've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.
- Why on earth?

600
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:13,749
I believe Mr. Bytes and l
are very much alike.

601
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:16,374
That's absurd !

602
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:25,540
lt seems l've made Mr. Merrick
into a curiosity again ,

603
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:29,915
only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival.

604
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:35,707
My name is constantly in the
newspapers and l'm always being

605
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:40,874
praised to the skies. Patients
ask expressly for my services.

606
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:43,707
Because you are a fine doctor.

607
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:48,499
John Merrick is happier and more
fulfilled then ever

608
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:51,249
and it's completely due to you .

609
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:56,290
What was it all for? Why did I do it?

610
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,290
What are you trying to say?

611
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,624
Am I a good man

612
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:08,540
or am I a bad man?

613
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:17,207
Steady on , Treves. Steady on .

614
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:20,082
Please sit down , won't you?

615
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:30,540
We usually open the proceedings
by reading the minutes.

616
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:35,582
In the interests of urgency
I think we should conclude the matter

617
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:40,124
under discussion , the case of
John Merrick, the Elephant Man .

618
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:43,332
One moment, Mr. Chairman !

619
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:47,707
As far as l'm concerned , this
creature has no business here.

620
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:53,957
I for one am sick and tired
of this freak-hunting

621
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:58,957
by ambitious young doctors,
trying to make name's for themselves.

622
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:02,749
To parade them about
in front of the society is one thing ,

623
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,124
but to waste the committee's time
with requests for shelter

624
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:10,540
for these abominations of nature
is quite another.

625
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,207
You must be more careful !

626
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:19,874
In the light
of these facts, our course is clear:

627
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:24,790
The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient, but

628
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:31,249
when will the rooms be vacated
for the use of more deserving cases?

629
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:35,874
I move that this Elephant Man be
removed from the premises immediately.

630
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:39,665
We have
a sacred duty to cure the sick

631
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:45,124
not to care for circus animals !
That is my last word on the subject.

632
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:49,790
Shall we vote?
- You are unshakeable in this?

633
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,957
Mr. Chairman , do you not have ears?

634
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,540
I am unalterably opposed !

635
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,290
My mind is made up.

636
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:03,707
You shall not sway me.
May we now vote,

637
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:05,749
at long last?

638
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:08,665
Yes, Broadneck.

639
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:10,874
I think the time has come.

640
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:15,040
Gentlemen , Her Royal Highness

641
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:18,290
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

642
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:39,124
Good morning .
I hope l'm not disturbing you .

643
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:43,457
Your presence here
is always greatly appreciated .

644
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:47,290
We were just taking a vote
on Mr. Merrick.

645
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:54,874
Her Royal Highness has shown
great interest in Mr. Merrick's fate.

646
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,082
I have, sir, as has the Queen .

647
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:06,290
I have a communication from the
Queen , which I should read to you .

648
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,957
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.

649
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,749
I would like to commend you

650
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:26,915
for the charitable face
you have shown Mr. John Merrick.

651
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:30,332
lt is laudable that you have
provided one of England's

652
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:36,749
unfortunate sons with a safe
and tranquil harbour, a home.

653
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:41,124
For this immeasurable kindness,
as well as the many acts of mercy

654
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:44,624
on behalf of the poor,
of which Mr. Carr-Gomm

655
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:47,290
has kept me informed ,

656
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:51,957
I gratefully thank you .
Signed , Victoria."

657
01:21:57,125 --> 01:22:01,457
I am sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing .

658
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,749
Thank you very much .
l'm sure we shall all try.

659
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,582
I move that Mr. John Merrick
be admitted on a permanent basis

660
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:17,624
provided the hospital receives
a yearly sum for the cost of one bed .

661
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:20,582
All those in favour?

662
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:34,582
Thank you , gentlemen .
The motion is carried .

663
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:43,165
Yes, come in !

664
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:55,207
Good afternoon . Mr. Carr-Gomm
has something he wants to say to you .

665
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:57,790
Mr. Merrick, I am very pleased

666
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:02,415
in being able to welcome you
officially to the London Hospital.

667
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:05,624
The Governing Committee has
unanimously voted that you should be

668
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:11,707
provided with these rooms on a
permanent basis. This is your home.

669
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:16,457
l'm so very, very glad for you .
- Welcome home, lad !

670
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:23,040
This is . . .

671
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,624
my home?
- Yes.

672
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:31,832
Please will you thank
the committee for me?

673
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:36,957
I will do my utmost
to merit their kindness.

674
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:41,957
This . . . is my home?

675
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:45,915
Yes. And this is for you .

676
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:53,624
Your dressing case !

677
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:05,707
Oh , thank you !

678
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,790
Thank you !

679
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:12,957
Oh my friends, thank you !

680
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:15,082
Thank you !

681
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:18,540
My friends !

682
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:28,457
Oh my friends !

683
01:24:29,416 --> 01:24:31,290
Thank you !

684
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:59,207
Who's next?
- I say!

685
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:01,624
What you again?
- Well . . .

686
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:05,082
These young ladies have never seen it.

687
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:10,124
You're on , mate !

688
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:15,915
That's it for this performance !

689
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:19,707
Jim , can I go?
- Sit down , Charlie !

690
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,207
There's always tomorrow, don't worry.

691
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,999
Room for one more?

692
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,832
At the right price.

693
01:25:33,541 --> 01:25:34,624
There's room .

694
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:49,457
Keep the noise down !

695
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:55,082
We don't want to frighten him !

696
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:33,624
My name is John Merrick.

697
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:40,290

698
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:46,832

01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:51,624
you are very beautiful !

700
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:57,707
Curtain time !

701
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:01,915
You look beautiful, darling !
I wouldn't change a thing !

702
01:27:02,791 --> 01:27:05,790
You look like the Prince of Wales !

703
01:27:07,083 --> 01:27:09,374
Here, my friends !

704
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:12,124
The Elephant Man !

705
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:20,457
I told you it was horrible,
just horrible.

706
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:32,790
Perhaps the ladies
would like a closer look?

707
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:36,540
Yes, yes !
- No, Jack, please !

708
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:39,582
Right, in you go !

709
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,707
He's quite a ladies' man !

710
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:52,249
Give the ladies' man a little kiss !

711
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:55,124
Go on , give him a kiss !

712
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:58,040
Jack, leave off!

713
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:11,707
That's enough romance !
Time for beddy-byes !

714
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,957
Keep the noise down !

715
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:08,957
Keep it quiet! Now watch this !

716
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:56,415
Okay, that's enough !

717
01:29:57,166 --> 01:30:00,457
Show's over!
See you back at the Peacock!

718
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:04,499
Get out of it!

719
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:35,582
Here, come on .

720
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:42,249
There you are. That's better.

721
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:45,957
l've done well tonight.

722
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:50,915
Here, buy yourself a sweet!

723
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,874
My treasure !

724
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:24,624
John?

725
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,124
John !

726
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:40,457
Mr. Treves,
I know what happened last night.

727
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,749
Oh , God !

728
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:12,915
Where is he?

729
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:23,540
Where is Mr. Merrick?

730
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,540
I don't know what you mean .
- Don't lie to me !

731
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:33,124
I know all about it, you were seen .

732
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:38,082
You're involved with Bytes,
aren't you? Where is he?

733
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:42,749
Wait a minute ! I haven't taken him
anywhere. I dunno no Bytes.

734
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:48,915
We were just having a bit of fun .
We never hurt him .

735
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,040
You tortured him ! He's gone !

736
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,457
When I left him he was in bed !

737
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:01,540
You're not listening to me !
I dunno no Bytes !

738
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:07,207
l've done nothing wrong !
People pay money to see your monster!

739
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,374
You're the monster, the freak.
Get out of here !

740
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:15,124
Get out!
- You don't frighten me !

741
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:19,832
l'm glad what I done.
You can do nothing about it!

742
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:22,457
Only Mothershead can sack me now!

743
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,582
Done !

744
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:48,290
There's something l'd like to say.

745
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:53,124
You know I felt
as deeply as you did about John .

746
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:57,415
Well now he's disappeared ,
very likely to the continent.

747
01:34:57,541 --> 01:35:02,665
You can't go after him ,
you're needed here by your patients.

748
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:07,707
You did everything in your power.

749
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:10,624
Everything in your power.

750
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:40,707
Get a stool !

751
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:09,124
Get up, you bastard !

752
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:38,957
Look at all these beautiful animals !

753
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:45,624
What a lot you have !

754
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,832
That sly bastard !

755
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:08,415
He's doing this to spite me !

756
01:38:18,375 --> 01:38:22,749
You're doing this to spite me
and it's got to stop !

757
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:27,124
Bytes, he's sick!
- Let him die !

758
01:38:29,458 --> 01:38:32,082
But don't think
l'm going to bury that . . .

759
01:38:34,666 --> 01:38:37,374
bag of flesh . No !

760
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:46,915
And that's a fact.

761
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:57,290
Bytes, stop !
- l'm going to fetch that lump of fat!

762
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:14,957
Stop !

763
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:45,790
Bytes, stop !

764
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:55,457
We've decided ,

765
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:01,957
we're going to get you out of here.

766
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,124
Alright?

767
01:42:50,166 --> 01:42:51,457
Luck, my friend !

768
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:57,915
Luck! And who needs it more than we?

769
01:44:28,458 --> 01:44:31,457
Sir, why is your head so big?

770
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,624
Why is your head so big?

771
01:44:40,916 --> 01:44:43,957
Why is your head so big? Tell me !

772
01:44:50,291 --> 01:44:52,415
Why is your head so big?

773
01:46:16,208 --> 01:46:17,707
No !

774
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:22,832
l'm not an elephant!

775
01:46:24,625 --> 01:46:27,457
I am not an animal !

776
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:34,457
I am a human being !

777
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:43,624
I am a man .

778
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:53,457
Out of the way, sir. Excuse me !

779
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:59,874
Mr. Treves, they've found him !

780
01:47:00,291 --> 01:47:02,124
They've found John !

781
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:24,207
Keep still !

782
01:47:27,125 --> 01:47:29,915
lt was nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress.

783
01:47:30,625 --> 01:47:32,332
lt's beautiful !

784
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:38,124
Does she know John's dying?

785
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:43,915
Yes, she knows.

786
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:00,415
How do I look?

787
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:03,415
Splendid !

788
01:48:03,791 --> 01:48:07,665
You will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid !

789
01:48:08,125 --> 01:48:11,290
Splendid . . . Shall we go?

790
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,290
I can't tell you
how sorry I am for what happened .

791
01:48:18,666 --> 01:48:21,790
You see, I had no idea.

792
01:48:22,208 --> 01:48:24,749
You mustn't blame yourself.

793
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:28,874
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me.

794
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:31,332
My friend ,

795
01:48:31,791 --> 01:48:35,749
I am happy every hour of the day.

796
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:41,957
My life is full,
because I know that I am loved .

797
01:48:45,875 --> 01:48:48,749
I have gained myself.

798
01:48:56,625 --> 01:49:02,207
I could not say that,
were it not for you .

799
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:07,957
Well . . .

800
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,290
you have done so much for me as well.

801
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:15,665
Thank you !

802
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:25,124
l'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora
and be back in a few minutes !

803
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:29,999
Very good , my friend .

804
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:36,124
My friend !

805
01:52:32,958 --> 01:52:34,457
Mrs. Kendal !

806
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:43,290
Your Royal Highness,
Ladies and Gentlemen !

807
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:48,457
Tonight's performance was special
for me, as it was to someone else,

808
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:51,624
a man who knows and loves the theatre.

809
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,707
And yet this
is the first time he's ever been here.

810
01:52:56,458 --> 01:53:00,624
I wish , the whole company wishes
with all their hearts

811
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:04,999
to dedicate tonight's performance
to Mr. John Merrick,

812
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:07,249
my very dear friend .

813
01:53:19,541 --> 01:53:21,874
Go on , John , they want to see you !

814
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,249
I can't.
- lt's alright, stand up !

815
01:54:03,791 --> 01:54:07,749
I really did believe

816
01:54:07,875 --> 01:54:11,540
that the ogre
would never get out of the dungeon .

817
01:54:14,791 --> 01:54:16,707
You really enjoyed yourself.

818
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:21,124
Oh , it was wonderful !

819
01:54:22,875 --> 01:54:25,790
We really must go again some evening .

820
01:54:25,958 --> 01:54:29,415
Oh , I hope so.

821
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:31,374
Yes, we will, we will.

822
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:34,540
Good , l'm pleased .

823
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:39,790
I ought to go. Must get some sleep.

824
01:54:40,916 --> 01:54:42,957
Goodnight. Sleep well.

825
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:47,957
And you too, my friend .

826
01:54:49,541 --> 01:54:52,540
So pleased you enjoyed yourself.
Goodnight.

827
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,749
Goodnight.

828
01:56:28,041 --> 01:56:32,790
lt's finished !

829
02:00:04,375 --> 02:00:07,957
Never, never! Nothing will die.

830
02:00:08,791 --> 02:00:12,207
The stream flows, the wind blows,

831
02:00:13,083 --> 02:00:17,124
the cloud fleets, the heart beats.
