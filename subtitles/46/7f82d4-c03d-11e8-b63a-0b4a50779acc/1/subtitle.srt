1
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,960
Report to Holy Master,

2
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,320
the Government is allied with the
Dutch Navy. They come to attack us.

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
Treat them the bomb.

4
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,960
How dare you!

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
Asia the Invincible
gathered 30,000 soldiers.

6
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,080
They are ready to fight to the North.

7
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,960
it seems that,
he is planning to rebel.

8
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,960
'To unite the world of martial arts.'

9
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,040
'Long life to the Sun moon Sect.'

10
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,000
Long life to our Holy Master,
Asia the Invincible.

11
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,120
Holy Master,

12
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
Wu is leading some swordsmen
to the Black Cliff.

13
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,920
They are approaching the palace.

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,600
They can do nothing to me!

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
They are here.

16
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,680
Kill Asia the Invincible.

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,640
Wu.

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
They killing Hook.

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,320
Watch my needles.

20
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,360
Ling!

21
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,480
Essence absorbing stance!

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,040
- I won't give you any shelter.
- Watch my Wonder Swords.

23
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
Who will you save first?

24
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,240
Asia the Invincible.

25
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I will never tell you.

26
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,680
I want you to remember me
and regret for your whole life.

27
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,840
"Ming Dynasty, Wan Li Year 33"

28
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,360
That's the flag of
Asia the Invincible.

29
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,280
In the past,

30
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,640
The demon and his army
were destroyed here.

31
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,080
Yes, how can you imagine that
after his death,

32
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,720
the Black Cliff is still full of
arrogant and haunted atmosphere.

33
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,200
I can feel...
Asia the Invincible hasn't died.

34
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,040
This must be the Black Cliff.

35
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,680
Right, according to the report
of the Chinese officers,

36
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,640
This sailing route is leading
to the Black Cliff.

37
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,320
Officer Koo, isn't it
the base of Asia the Invincible?

38
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,000
General Golida,

39
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,960
Asia the Invincible
sank the Dutch warship...

40
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
right here?

41
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,280
Is Asia the Invincible
that horrible...

42
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
as you have mentioned?

43
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,440
The world of Han's martial arts
is hard to predict and understand.

44
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,040
There are many rumors in the world,
no matter they are true or not.

45
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,160
I do want to learn about it.

46
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,200
Brother Koo, we are ordered
to lead the Spanish here,

47
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,640
The purpose is to find the goods
from the sunken Dutch ship.

48
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,760
Why should we go up
to the Black Cliff?

49
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,320
I think Golida's intention is not
only the stuff from the sunken ship.

50
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
What are they doing?

51
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,880
They are having a sacrifice.

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,360
I believe they're scared of the evil
and would like to drive it away.

53
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,240
If they are so scared,
why do they still insist to go up?

54
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,840
yes, should we ask them why?

55
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,640
Golida said he was curious
about the Black Cliff.

56
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,200
In fact, me too.

57
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,080
Asia the Invincible was a name
of astonishment in the past.

58
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,080
Here, the Black Cliff, is his base.

59
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,960
Curious? What made you curious?

60
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,000
- Chin, Ling.
- Yes Sir.

61
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,640
You stay behind, I am going up first.

62
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,520
Woo, he can fly!

63
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,080
This is some sort of Kung-fu
in our world of martial arts.

64
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,360
What is the world of martial arts?

65
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,720
it isn't a name of a place.

66
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
We called the place where swordsmen
gather the "World of Martial Arts."

67
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,920
So what is the place
where swordsmen gather?

68
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, the place where
swordsmen live...

69
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,080
That's the place where
the swordsmen living around.

70
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
We just call it
the world of martial arts.

71
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,440
We are far behind, let's go.

72
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,920
Do you understand
what he has mentioned?

73
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,240
You are good at Han's dialects.
Don't you understand?

74
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,040
Sure I do.

75
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,640
Okay, let's go to
the world of martial arts.

76
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,120
The Notorious Evil:
Asia the Invincible.

77
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
Wu!

78
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,760
Who?

79
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,480
Asia the Invincible, if your soul
wants to see me, come out.

80
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,560
But you are already dead.

81
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,400
Why should you mention
the history again?

82
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,360
Stay calm,
there is something strange.

83
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,120
This is a land of souls
and evil spirits.

84
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,680
It's not wise of the living people
to visit here. You'd better leave.

85
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Who are you? Human or devil?

86
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,880
Don't get mad, don't shoot.

87
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,160
The Black Cliff hasn't been
so busy for a long time.

88
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,480
I am the warden of this Holy Altar
for 3 generations.

89
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,120
I have seen the ups and downs
of the masters.

90
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,480
Asia the Invincible
misleader our Sect,

91
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
death is his only end!

92
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,920
You mean Asia Invincible is dead?

93
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,880
What? Hasn't he died?

94
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,400
Don't be afraid.

95
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,880
Impossible!

96
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
His corpse fell down
to the cliff together...

97
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,680
with his powerful Kung-fu.

98
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,720
Just over there.

99
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,280
Would you take me there?

100
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
Go.

101
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,000
This is the grave of
Asia the Invincible.

102
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,240
Asia the Invincible.

103
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,680
Asia the Invincible!

104
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,280
Thank God,
this demon is locked right here.

105
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,440
I can't totally believe
that he is dead,

106
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,040
Why?

107
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,040
The only way to prove
he is dead or not,

108
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,560
is to look at his corpse.

109
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,360
Brother Koo,
do you want to dig his grave?

110
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
Maybe there is nothing inside.

111
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Let me do it.

112
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,720
General Golida.

113
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,440
look at the corpse,

114
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
these are what left
by the notorious demon.

115
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,560
What he has left the world
is a notorious name.

116
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,200
The Notorious Demon:
Asia the Invincible.

117
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,160
What are you looking for?

118
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,680
I've spent great effort,

119
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,280
come here from afar,
only for one thing.

120
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,120
Don't stop me.

121
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,160
What are you searching?

122
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
His Sacred Scroll

123
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,720
If this is his dead body

124
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
I've heard that his mysterious
Kung-fu came from the Sacred Scroll.

125
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,040
General Golida,

126
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,360
I am ordered to take you here
for the sunken ship.

127
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
But not for the Sacred Scroll.

128
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,240
You fool!
If I didn't use this excuse,

129
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,280
Your Majesty wouldn't
have been deceived.

130
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,240
And you wouldn't
have taken me here...

131
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
to find the thing I wanted

132
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,840
Koo.

133
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,600
You got mysterious Kung-fu,
I got science.

134
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
Asia the Invincible is a legend.

135
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,000
Now, he was buried underground.

136
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,240
We Hans have a saying,
"Respect the Heroes".

137
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Even you don't respect him,

138
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
you'd give him some face.

139
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,720
You can't insult his skeleton.

140
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,680
We sail for treasure
is the funniest thing.

141
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,240
You can't even explain clearly
what the world of martial arts is!

142
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,080
If I can't get the Sacred Scroll,
it will be with you.

143
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,280
Golida,

144
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,480
if I let you touch the body
of Asia the Invincible,

145
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,240
Koo will have
a notorious name forever.

146
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,440
Get lost.

147
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,640
You have science,
I have mysterious Kung-fu.

148
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,000
You do despise the warden
of the Sun Moon Sect!

149
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,160
Take it back!

150
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,800
Follow me.

151
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
Let's go for Koo.

152
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,160
Thank you for saving my life.

153
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,200
A courtier tried hard
to protect a grave.

154
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,080
You are appreciated.

155
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
- Wine can stop pain.
- Thank you!

156
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,760
Not many people in the world
appreciate good win.

157
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,120
But I won't believe your identity.

158
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,720
Because I can tell,
you are Asia the Invincible.

159
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,960
What made you suspect me
to be Asia the Invincible?

160
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,520
I know pretty well about
the history of the Sun Moon Sect.

161
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,800
Since you are the warden,
and you have great power,

162
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
Asia the Invincible and Wu had
many severe fights among themselves.

163
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,320
They won't allow you,
such a guy to stay in his Sect.

164
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,600
Besides,
you're so skilled in Kung-fu.

165
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,200
Why you are not renowned?

166
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,280
So, Asia the Invincible
is still alive.

167
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,040
You are Asia the Invincible!

168
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,760
If I were Asia the Invincible,

169
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,680
then you would not leave here alive.

170
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,080
I won't mind being killed,

171
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,960
that's my wish!

172
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,080
Don't you feel regret
to see Asia the Invincible?

173
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,640
Why should I regret
if my wish come true.

174
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay, I will make
your wish come true.

175
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,240
Koo, 14 of your valves
has been closed by me,

176
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,840
you're dying.

177
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,600
Just because I have found out
you're Asia the Invincible?

178
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,040
That's what I presumed.

179
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
Asia the Invincible,
since you want to kill me.

180
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,520
You should keep your promise.

181
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
Let me see your real face.

182
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,240
Does it worth?

183
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,240
It's the fact, why do you
still ask this silly question?

184
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,080
Fine!

185
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,080
Koo, does it worth
dying for a glance of me?

186
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,320
Sure!

187
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,920
- Your are the big fool of the world!
- Wait!

188
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,840
Are you scared?

189
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,080
Don't you think no one knows...

190
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,440
you are hiding at the Black Cliff?

191
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,520
Do you know how many
Asia the Invincible...

192
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,360
are there in the world?

193
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
Although you hide yourself,

194
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,160
there're still many
Asia the Invincible.

195
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,080
Bull shit!

196
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,960
You close my valves, because
you don't want me to die so quickly!

197
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,640
You cunning guy, I want you
to feed the fishes with your body.

198
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
Are there many fake
Asia the Invincible?

199
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Right, after you missing,

200
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,840
Many people tried to rule
over the world in the name of you.

201
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
Although you feel regret
under the Black Cliff,

202
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,920
Many Asia the Invincible
are still fighting for power.

203
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,680
You didn't kill, but many
innocent people died because of you.

204
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,320
What a troubled world.

205
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,720
Koo, since my name
is still a disaster.

206
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,280
Take me to stop the
fake Asia the Invincible.

207
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,480
I can do that,
but you must promise me.

208
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,560
Never kill again.

209
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,320
Good!

210
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,600
If you disclose my identity,

211
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
I'll kill not only
the innocent people, but you too.

212
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,240
Let's go for the
fake Asia the Invincible.

213
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,040
A ship is coming!

214
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,600
Be alert!

215
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,600
Be alert!

216
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,040
Report to our Holy Master.

217
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,840
We've discover that
a ship is approaching us.

218
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,240
Mo Yan Lu Chong.
Are your goods ready?

219
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,360
I have brought you the gold.

220
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,040
30000 guns, 100 cannons,

221
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
8000 baskets of gunpowder.

222
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Our ship is dangerous under the sun.

223
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
If not cool it with water.

224
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,880
Our ship will explode any time.

225
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,720
Mo Yan Lu Chong,

226
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
you know sound transmission too.

227
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,760
But you are exaggerating.

228
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,040
How can you cool
such a big ship with water?

229
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,720
Asia the Invincible, but you are
more exaggerating than me.

230
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,000
My ship left Japan 8 years ago.

231
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,360
But I am always well informed

232
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,080
According to the report of my ninjas.

233
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,640
Asia the invincible died
4 months ago...

234
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,480
at the Black Cliff.

235
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,680
If this is the fact,

236
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,640
you are not Asia the Invincible.

237
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,480
It's lousy trick!

238
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,800
The Japanese ninja!

239
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,040
How can you fool me?

240
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,520
Raise.

241
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,320
I, Mo Yan Lo Chong is coming.

242
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,440
I will let your fellows
to fight with you.

243
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,560
Watch my sword!

244
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,880
- Come here.
- Master!

245
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
Try my Iron Balls.

246
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,160
Watch out!

247
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,360
A Japanese ninja is nothing special.

248
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,080
I sank down into the sea.

249
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,360
Turn to the East,
get ready the cannon.

250
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
Fire!

251
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,840
Dai, I want you tonight.

252
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,360
The opium is the tribute
from Ryukyu Islands.

253
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,040
Such precious thing should be
shared with our Holy Master.

254
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,080
Holy Master.

255
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,920
I haven't slept with you since
you've been my concubine,

256
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,480
do you know why?

257
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,240
I don't know.

258
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,880
I suspect that you are a man.

259
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,080
look, he is the betrayer!

260
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,480
The Japanese ninja...

261
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,440
is really great!

262
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,160
When did you find out I am a ninja?

263
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,360
Because when you looked at me.

264
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
Your eyes are different
from other concubines.

265
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
But why don't you
take action earlier?

266
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,280
I want you to tell me
how to trace Mo Yan Lu Chong.

267
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Pigeon!

268
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,240
I need this to find Mo Yan Lu Chong.

269
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,880
What are you crying?

270
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
The one you loved
is right in front of you.

271
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,280
But, how about my lover?
Where are you?

272
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,200
Koo, you are quite good at flying.

273
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,600
You are still capable
to follow me after an hour.

274
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,960
But still I can't get ahead of you.

275
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,960
Do you want to?

276
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,600
The universe is endless,
the stars are bright.

277
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,640
The sun rises from the East,
I am the Invincible!

278
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,160
The universe is endless,
the stars are bright.

279
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,320
The sun rises from the East,
I am the Invincible!

280
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,240
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible.

281
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,720
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible.

282
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,160
Please honor me
the light of thousand generations.

283
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,800
Please honor me
the light of thousand generations.

284
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,560
Asia the Invincible
is just a normal guy.

285
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,240
Somehow he is worshipped as God.

286
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,320
People do not really understand
Asia the Invincible.

287
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,960
They don't need to understand
Asia the Invincible.

288
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,080
They only want...

289
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,760
Asia the Invincible, our Holy Master.

290
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,520
Burn me to death!

291
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,080
I am willing to die for you!
Hurry up.

292
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,040
Oh, Blood Sacrifice.

293
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,480
Hurry up!

294
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,280
Who are you? Why are you here?

295
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
What you are worshipping,

296
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,800
Is in fact the origin of evils.

297
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
Do you know it?
Why do you worship him?

298
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,000
Who are you?

299
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,840
You can't insult our Holy Master.

300
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,440
Holy Master?

301
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,320
You abuse the name of Asia the
Invincible to fool these Highlanders.

302
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,200
Do you want to offend him?

303
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,400
I an designated by
Asia the Invincible!

304
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,920
I rule over them according
to the will of Asia the Invincible.

305
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,640
Bull shit!

306
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,120
You haven't seen the
real Asia the Invincible.

307
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
You will be punished.

308
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,200
Only me who can communicate
with Asia the Invincible.

309
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,920
If you insult me, you are
insulting Asia the invincible.

310
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,280
Do you know who I am?

311
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,680
Tell me, who are you?

312
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,200
Who exactly are you?

313
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,320
How dare you talk to me like that!

314
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,000
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible!

315
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,000
What power has Asia the Invincible
evincible given you?

316
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
There are continuous
disasters in Highland.

317
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,280
The government is oppressing us.

318
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,720
Only Asia the Invincible
can protect us.

319
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,640
Foolish! I will kill those
who keep on worshipping me.

320
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Because I am the real
Asia the Invincible.

321
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,200
Bull shit!

322
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
You believe the fake one
but not the true one.

323
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,760
Now you should
believe in what I said?

324
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,120
We can't surrender, I want to
devote my heart to the Holy Master!

325
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,480
We can't surrender!

326
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,680
If you want to devote your heart,
dig it out now.

327
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,040
No one can affect our love
towards the Holy Master.

328
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,600
Who suspects, who is going
against Asia the Invincible!

329
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,680
Do you see our strength now?

330
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,080
You want Asia the Invincible,

331
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,200
I will give you Asia the Invincible.

332
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,440
Give me your hearts.

333
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,800
Stop murdering!

334
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,840
Asia the Invincible! You promised me
that you wouldn't kill.

335
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,720
What the hell are you? It's the
business of the Highlanders.

336
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,720
There is nothing to do
with the government officials.

337
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,280
I had said, who disclose me,
who should be killed.

338
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,760
It's you who disclose yourself,

339
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,120
not me.

340
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,920
If you want to kill me,
not a reason is needed!

341
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,560
I want the whole world
to hate Asia the Invincible.

342
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,280
I want to slaughter...

343
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,640
those fake Asia the Invincible!!

344
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,640
Is this the logo
of the Sun Moon Sect?

345
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,840
I am the government officials,
who dares cuff me?

346
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
Shut up!

347
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,320
Tell me how many government
officials are there?

348
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,680
Tell me, so I will keep you
a complete corpse.

349
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,320
Asia the Invincible?

350
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,080
Another Asia the Invincible.

351
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,680
How dare a little dog tease me?

352
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,800
I want to make your mouth shut,
let's see how you laugh again!

353
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,120
I think you wouldn't mind
somebody tease you.

354
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,640
The real Asia the Invincible
doesn't want to admit his identity.

355
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,320
And you, try every means to claim
yourselves to be Asia the Invincible.

356
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,480
I don't know you real identity.

357
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,320
But, the Kung-fu of Asia the
Invincible came from the Sacred Scroll.

358
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,040
Show us the Sacred Scroll...

359
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,440
to prove yourself the
real Asia the invincible.

360
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,080
You fat-headed, since there are
so many fake Asia the Invincible.

361
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,280
There will be fake Sacred Scroll!

362
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,840
Let's see how long can you stand.

363
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,320
broken!

364
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,640
- Brother Ko.
- Officer Koo!

365
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,400
You are here!

366
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,280
We were caught
when hiding form the Spanish.

367
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,080
look!

368
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,960
- The Navy of Ming Dynasty!
- The arms of our government.

369
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,360
Right!
We bought these from the navy...

370
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,640
who stole the arms from their camps.

371
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,480
That's why it will soon be
the end of your dynasty soon.

372
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,720
I know your warships are coming...

373
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,400
South to go against us.

374
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,800
During our fight.

375
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,240
I will hang you up.

376
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,520
Let's wait and
see your dog face then!

377
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,200
It's useless,
we've tried this before.

378
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,880
This is our chance to survive.

379
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,000
Stay back.

380
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,240
Don't move, once they are in a mess.

381
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,080
The nearby navy camp
will hear the explosion.

382
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,280
At that moment,

383
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
we can get rid of all
fake Asia the Invincible.

384
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,640
How smart is your fat-head.

385
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,720
Officer, is that your trick?

386
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,400
You want to keep my life not because
you want me to cover you.

387
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,480
Because you want to know where is
the real Asia the Invincible.

388
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,120
You are afraid that
he will show up anytime.

389
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,880
Why did you say
that's the real Asia the Invincible?

390
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,000
It's useless to kill them!

391
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,160
It's not necessary for me
to tell you, he will show up soon.

392
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,640
Don't worry, he will come to you.

393
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,000
You are so anxious
to know he is real or not.

394
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Sure your purpose is to find out
the real Asia the Invincible.

395
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
Have you waited him for a long time?

396
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,160
They are not
at the front of the ship.

397
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,720
Report to our Holy Master.

398
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,360
We've searched everywhere, but we
can't locate the sound of the flute.

399
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,320
We can't tell
where the sound comes from.

400
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,240
It's always like he finds others.

401
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,400
No one could find him out.

402
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,360
Here he comes.

403
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,320
It's we who leaded him here,

404
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,400
how can we send him back?

405
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,800
Raise the logo of our Sun Moon Sect.
Greet our honorable guest.

406
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,920
You return finally.

407
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,800
- Snow!
- I can hear you calling my name.

408
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,160
My coming here is not for you.

409
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,480
Then why did you come?

410
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,360
I came here for burying everything.

411
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,240
Forget Asia the Invincible.

412
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,160
The ship ran aground.

413
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,360
Sir, the gate of the prison
is ruined.

414
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,240
Okay, rush out!

415
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,160
Go to the head of the ship now.

416
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,720
To stop Asia the Invincible
destroying this ship again.

417
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,080
Catch it.

418
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,920
Take it back!

419
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,400
Asia the Invincible.

420
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,880
Holy Master.

421
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,640
Koo,

422
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,920
I have killed many
fake Asia the Invincible.

423
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,960
Asia the Invincible,
you are always superior.

424
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,440
But this is your Sun Moon Sect.

425
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,480
Stop another massacre please.

426
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,040
Koo, I want you to see how I return
to the world of martial arts.

427
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,520
And I want you to see my massacre
in the world of martial arts.

428
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,280
I am wrong. My holy Master

429
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,400
I lead the Sect in the name of you.

430
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,640
Because I am waiting for your return.

431
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,760
To let you lead us again,
and establish our own kingdom.

432
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,080
On your knees.

433
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,520
On your knees. Hurry up.

434
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,360
He is the real Asia the Invincible.

435
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,640
Snow, let bygones be bygones.

436
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,120
Master, I won't
let you leave me again.

437
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,800
I am a notorious demon.

438
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,680
I will go my own way.

439
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Whenever you go, I will follow you.

440
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,040
You want to bother me?

441
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,360
If you want to follow me,
I will break your legs and hands.

442
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,600
Stop.

443
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,760
Just leave,
what do you want to proof?

444
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,720
None of your business.

445
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,240
You are my woman indeed.
You don't scare of death!

446
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,240
Death is not horrible. It's really
a great pain for one to live alone.

447
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,680
Okay, I will leave you,
the rubbish to be alive.

448
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,600
I want you to be painful forever.

449
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,360
Why do you hurt
the one who cares for you?

450
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,280
I don't need others concern,

451
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,880
what I want is the hatred of yours.

452
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,400
On your knees.
He is the real Asia the Invincible.

453
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,760
The powerful Sun Moon Sect.

454
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,960
To unite the world.

455
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,440
Long life to our Holy Master.

456
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,320
Asia the Invincible,
the Sun Moon Sect.

457
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,960
Those who are longing for my return,
I tell you!

458
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
History can be changed!

459
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,480
Is Asia the Invincible so horrible!

460
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,120
This disaster will begin
from this ship.

461
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,840
And it will spread over
the whole world of martial arts.

462
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,520
Why do you still trust in
Asia the invincible?

463
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,680
he had abandoned you.

464
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,560
You'd better stop the wandering life.

465
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,000
Why don't you surrender
and join our court?

466
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,040
How ridiculous!
We always rule ourselves.

467
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,120
Who do you think you are? Damn it.

468
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,480
If not for Snow.

469
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,280
Our Holy Master won't abandon us.

470
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,240
That's right!

471
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,120
Snow, you deceived us.

472
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,520
You are the sinner of our Sect.

473
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,560
Snow, you sinner!

474
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,280
What else do you want to say?

475
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,640
Speak up!

476
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,440
I have made a deadly sin.

477
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,520
Kill her!

478
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,920
Ching, protect Snow.

479
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
Kill that 3 damn officers too.

480
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,120
Hang them to death and air dried them.

481
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
Right, that's a good idea.

482
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,440
Send the 3 damn officers to hell!

483
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,160
Execute the law of our Sect.

484
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,880
Brother Koo, save Snow now.

485
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,680
Stop, you are not capable
to defeat them.

486
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,600
Brother Koo, are we going to
take her along with us?

487
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,000
Cut the crap.

488
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,600
Those who are hurt by
Asia the Invincible,

489
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,600
Are all our friends.

490
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,400
We can't defeat them by Kung-fu,
let's use the cannon.

491
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,560
If you do so, we will die together.

492
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,880
A part of this ship has been...

493
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,480
destroyed by Asia the Invincible.

494
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,480
If we try to attack each other
by the cannon...

495
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,440
the ship will be sunned,
all of us will die.

496
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,360
Brother Koo,
the cannon has no blast wire.

497
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,760
Save your crocodile tears,
this ship can't stay any longer.

498
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,800
As we just want to survive.

499
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,680
Give us Snow, then we'll let you go.

500
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,320
Right, Highlanders are Highlanders,
Hans are Hans.

501
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,760
We're of different world.

502
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,280
Give us Snow, then we'll let you go.

503
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,040
Have you forgotten...

504
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,240
how Snow treated you?

505
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,240
For this sinner.

506
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,840
Don't you think
it's worth dying with us?

507
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,400
Ching, don't let the wind
extinguish the fire.

508
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,840
Sir, this ship has run aground,

509
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,240
if we delay anymore,
we will be sunk with this ship.

510
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,600
Ling, in such as emergency,

511
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,320
how can you talk like this?

512
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,440
What do you mean?

513
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,680
No, I don't want to die like this.

514
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,560
You have internal conflicts
among yourselves.

515
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,440
You are not as united as us.

516
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,200
Sir, I don't want to rescue her.

517
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,760
Please let me go!

518
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,200
To betray us at such critical moment?
You are not my subordinate.

519
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,560
Go now.

520
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,760
Thank you, Sir!

521
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,720
Come and join us.

522
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,560
He knew our drawbacks.

523
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,640
So I have to do so,
please forgive me.

524
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,840
Ching, in order to save an enemy.

525
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,760
We have to kill our man,

526
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,280
What's that are we going
to rescue or kill?

527
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,920
Brother Koo, what's the matter?

528
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,520
Brother Koo. You...

529
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,960
I think, your valves are closed
by a supreme Kung-fu master.

530
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,320
The blood is flowing backward.

531
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,640
You are seriously hurt,
you are dying!

532
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,160
Yes, I am hurt by
Asia the Invincible.

533
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,000
We are dying too.

534
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,040
Since you cannot protect yourself,
why should you save me?

535
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,440
It's me who leaded him here.

536
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,200
I have to bear all responsibilities.

537
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,440
When the sun rises from the East.

538
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,120
That'll be the end of your life.

539
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,920
That's why...

540
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,600
I time the time left.

541
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
The noise.

542
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,200
Shit, it's the Spanish warship.

543
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,760
The Spanish warship is approaching.

544
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,720
Where is it?

545
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,280
They come for...

546
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,280
Asia the Invincible.

547
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,320
We hand the flag
of our Sun Moon Sect.

548
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,840
They will shoot us
once they see the flag!

549
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,720
Don't listen to him,
don't listen to him.

550
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,320
What are you waiting?

551
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,480
Lower the sail.
Face them with the cannon.

552
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,440
You are the courtier of the gov't,
don't cheat me with such trick.

553
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,360
Why should I cheat you?

554
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,680
- Ching, lower the sail.
- Don't move!

555
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,480
Or I will fire you!

556
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,320
Ching, go now.

557
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,320
Ching, it's peaceful around.

558
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,120
Luckily we haven't met
another warship.

559
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,760
Brother Koo,

560
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,960
when will this woman leave us?

561
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,120
Just throw me into the sea.

562
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,840
Brother Koo.

563
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,040
Stop helping me.

564
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,920
Will you call me dog again?

565
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,760
Unless you take off this dog's clothe,
or you'll be dog forever.

566
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,360
Go on insulting me if you feel great.

567
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,640
Hold it.

568
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,080
Stop thinking anything nonsense,
Asia the Invincible will not come back.

569
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,040
I know you must hate him.

570
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,760
I am just worrying about him.

571
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,960
He is fooled by fate,
he can't escape.

572
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,960
If I were Asia the Invincible.

573
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,320
I won't leave you.

574
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,920
Ching, when will we reach the camps?

575
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,120
According to the speed
of the current.

576
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,280
We can reach the camps after 6 hours.

577
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,840
Wear it, I am Asia the Invincible.

578
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,960
Boss, she sings better than you.

579
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,120
Give way!

580
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,360
Damn you, where do you come from?

581
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,720
Do you want to take
the bread out of our mouths?

582
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,360
Are you the one
who gives order here?

583
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,640
You want to challenge me?

584
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,360
Not necessary, tonight,
I will listen to you.

585
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,760
Where are the pretty girls?

586
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,920
Stop bothering me.

587
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,520
Are your boss looking for me?

588
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,200
I do want it, so what?

589
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,680
You are not qualified to touch me.

590
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,680
Damn it!

591
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,040
Do you think that you are protected,
so you don't even respect me!

592
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,400
I tell you, we wanderers are nasty.

593
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,720
Today, you are the boss,
tomorrow I will be the boss.

594
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,600
She is sick, let me serve your boss.

595
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,840
Get up.

596
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,560
Breathless? He is breathless.

597
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,120
Kidding?

598
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,800
Gut up, wake up.

599
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,960
How are you, Master?

600
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,200
How are you, Master?

601
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,200
Mo Yan Lu Choung.

602
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,680
Mo Yan Lu Choung.

603
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,760
If you want to take them away,

604
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,120
gamble with me.

605
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,240
If you win, you may take them away.

606
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,440
I think you two
are great Kung-fu masters.

607
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,520
But, this is such a small bet.

608
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,600
Why not make it bigger?

609
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,920
What?

610
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,480
The winner can take us away,

611
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,240
The bet is too simple.

612
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,840
Why not cut the legs
off from the loser?

613
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,920
You want to add
a pair of legs for gambling?

614
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,000
What? Are you scared?

615
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,480
Okay. I won't give it a damn.

616
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,720
Just go ahead.

617
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,560
it depends on fate.

618
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,080
What do you want to bet?

619
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,160
Big or small?

620
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,760
Small!

621
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,280
How about you?

622
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,240
Big!

623
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,360
Fine!

624
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,640
No need to open it. I am the winner.

625
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,120
I have to open it.

626
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,160
The dead won't argue with me.

627
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,200
I am still here.

628
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,480
The loser should pay his legs.

629
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,240
Open, 4,5,6. Big.

630
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,120
You lost.

631
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,640
Don't offend him.

632
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,200
Cut your legs off.

633
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,680
How dare you!

634
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,840
General Mo Yan Lu Chong,
we will follow you.

635
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,120
Please let her go.

636
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,760
She doesn't know the rules.

637
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,040
All of you go back,
take her to see me tonight.

638
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,440
Yes.

639
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,600
General...

640
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,760
Mo Yan Lu Chong.

641
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,760
Don't think that
it's an ordinary bet.

642
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,960
Some one will come to take your legs.

643
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,240
Go.

644
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,840
I haven't known your name yet.

645
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,240
I am the same as you,
we have no names.

646
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,640
The people are heartless
and they claimed me heartless.

647
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,800
I am sorry to drag you down.

648
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,680
I should have to thank you.

649
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,000
It's you who let me know that.

650
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,720
It's painful to be
an ordinary people.

651
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,680
Who are you?

652
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,600
Me?

653
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,560
About the answer of it...
I do want to know too

654
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,640
Help yourself!

655
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,680
Mo Yan Lu Chong, long time no see.

656
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,600
Asia the Invincible, here you are.

657
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,880
After you had visited
the Black Cliff 3 years ago.

658
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,680
I wrote to Japan
to check which generation...

659
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,320
you are of the
Mo Yan Lu Chong Family.

660
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,600
Asia the Invincible,
you are very smart.

661
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,520
Oh! How come?

662
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,960
I had told you...

663
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,040
that someone would
come for your legs.

664
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,480
You've known my background already.

665
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,720
Right! Because all the troops of the
real Mo Yan Lu Chong were destroyed.

666
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,000
Since the 4th generation of...

667
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,640
Mo Yan Lu Chong Family has been
taken over by Liu Seng already.

668
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,280
Watch my Mo Yan Sword.

669
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,080
Cut!

670
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,080
Ninja Disappearance!

671
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,320
- It's your real face.
- Thunder Bomb!

672
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,640
Ninjas come out!

673
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,080
Poison liquid.

674
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,840
You're also a great Kung-fu master.

675
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,120
Why do you pretend
to be Mo Yan Lu Chong?

676
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,480
What a pity! Actually,
you are a miserable as I do.

677
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,280
You dare not show others
your real face.

678
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,760
Sir, are you alright?

679
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,600
I'm fine, go out.

680
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,640
Yes.

681
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,840
"Commander of Ming Dynasty Navy"

682
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,960
Why there isn't any guard?

683
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,320
Go in and take a look!

684
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,120
I've caught it, I've caught it!
it is still yelling!

685
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Here comes Officer Koo.

686
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,040
Where is Officer Tin?

687
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,960
Officer Tin? He hasn't waken up yet.

688
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,800
Still haven't got up
to inspect the military affairs yet.

689
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,240
Being navy officers of Ming Dynasty,
all of you are badly disciplined.

690
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,320
You come here to settle the riot.

691
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,400
You are such a mess.
How can you fight with the enemies?

692
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,080
Keep on insulting.

693
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,360
I don't mind giving a lecture
to your damn soldiers.

694
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,040
How would you tackle
your foes when they come?

695
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,040
Yes Sir.

696
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,880
Greet. It's great!

697
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,280
- Brother Koo.
- Brother Kai Wan.

698
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,600
Brother Koo.

699
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,400
Your camp is loosely guarded,

700
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,200
don't you afraid of
any attack from the foes?

701
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,320
How come! There are so many foes.

702
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,880
All of us just want to live.

703
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,520
Not many people like fighting.

704
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,880
Brother Kai Wan.

705
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,520
May I know your good name?

706
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,960
Get us 2 jars of Kaoliang, hurry up.

707
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,680
Coming, don't be in such a hurry.
Making you drunk.

708
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,600
Get us the main course.

709
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,840
Get me some more wine.

710
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,640
There are many advantages
of being a soldier.

711
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,960
When you hunt, you will get
supply of guns from the Court.

712
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:12,080
There are chefs from the Court
who take care of our meals.

713
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,720
I treasure my fortune,

714
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,920
so I enjoy sharing nice things
with my bosom friends.

715
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,880
come, have a cup of wine with us.

716
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,400
Brother Kai Wan.

717
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,880
You bastard.

718
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,680
How adore you scold me?

719
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,840
General...

720
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,800
There is something wrong
in the Western yard.

721
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,120
- What's happening?
- No information right now.

722
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,360
- Assembly!
- General!

723
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,080
General.
Here comes Asia the Invincible.

724
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,360
All our soldiers have been injured.

725
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,640
General, Asia the Invincible
is so cruel that,

726
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,880
the soldiers of our two battalions
were seriously injured.

727
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,640
So powerful? Let me handle him.

728
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,120
- The force of Battalion 7 follow me.
- Yes, Sir.

729
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,280
it is the one in red.

730
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,520
I want to compete with you.

731
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,400
Move faster. Protect His Excellency.

732
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,320
Protect His Excellency.

733
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,840
Brother Koo.

734
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,520
Chin, if something
happened unexpectedly,.

735
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,400
You would have to leave here at once.

736
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,080
Brother Kai wan.

737
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,360
Officer Koo,
which part you've got hurt?

738
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,440
Brother Kai Wan, cheer up...

739
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,240
Brother Kai Wan...

740
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,480
It's funny. It's really very funny.

741
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,960
Our camp is the happiest one.

742
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,440
We haven't enjoyed
such a game for a long time.

743
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,320
It's rare for us having visitors.

744
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,200
Brother Koo, it's a funny game.

745
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,880
I'm afraid that you have never
got such a chance to play.

746
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,560
Brother Koo, don't you believe
there is Asia the Invincible?

747
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,120
Of course, there is an
Asia the Invincible.

748
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,960
Call our Asia the Invincible out.

749
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,520
Asia the Invincible...

750
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,920
Asia the Invincible?

751
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,200
See, our Asia the Invincible
is not so bad.

752
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,080
Officer Tin and all officers!

753
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,560
Asia the Invincible,

754
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,000
the most prominent among
the brothels of the 13 provinces.

755
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,960
They're all bought by me.

756
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:11,160
Asia the Invincible is just a name.

757
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,600
I can call myself
Asia the Invincible too.

758
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,760
Come on, call one.

759
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,880
Versatility, a full unity
of the world of martial arts.

760
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,600
Hurrah, General Tin!

761
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,440
Sing a song, with bureaucratic tone

762
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:32,360
"Versatility, a full unity
of the world of martial arts,"

763
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,840
"Asia the Invincible."

764
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:48,200
"Hurrah! Hurrah, General Tin!"

765
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,480
Sing like this, then I will leave
a good reputation for generations

766
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,000
I also know the Kung-fu of
Asia the Invincible's flying needles.

767
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,680
Let me show you.

768
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,560
Bingo!

769
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,400
Good! I'm great!

770
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,800
- Snow!
- What?

771
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,880
Tin.

772
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,200
I just want to check her wound.

773
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,840
She is my woman.

774
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,360
I won't let anyone touch her.

775
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,120
Yes, it's not decent
to fool other's wife.

776
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,680
She is seriously hurt.

777
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,640
Here is not a good place,

778
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,280
you had better
take a rest in my camp.

779
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,080
It's not convenient for us
to stay in the camp with you.

780
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,520
Not easy?

781
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,120
Let me go out,
so you can sleep with her.

782
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,320
- Man!
- Yes.

783
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,000
- Take these two guests for a rest.
- Yes.

784
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,120
it seems to me that
I can only sleep...

785
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,000
with my Asia the invincible tonight.

786
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,520
Am I your woman?

787
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,200
Light more!

788
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,160
It's funny!

789
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,720
How wonderful is it.

790
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,880
Give me the wine.

791
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,840
Oh shit! Asia the Invincible?

792
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,560
Versatility, a full unity
of the world of Martial Arts!

793
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,840
Unbeaten! General Tin!

794
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,800
Brother Koo.

795
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:35,200
Brother Kai Wan, something a
gentleman should do but something not.

796
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:41,320
We should not argue for a woman!

797
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,080
We can do nothing
once get involved in a war.

798
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,000
Koo, you said I was your woman.

799
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,920
Now, how can you settle it?

800
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,440
Well... Take care of yourself.

801
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,760
He asked me to take care of myself.

802
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,680
We'll, let's take care.
Go to the camp now.

803
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,240
Okay.

804
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,000
But I've to dress up as
Asia the Invincible first.

805
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,200
You want to be Asia the Invincible?
Good!

806
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,000
I've stop your valve remotely.

807
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,240
I don't want you to pretend
to Asia the invincible anymore,

808
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,760
so I must take you away.

809
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,000
You lie down so quickly!
My dear Asia the Invincible!

810
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,400
Bingo!

811
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,000
Dismiss!

812
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,160
- Bingo!
- Dismiss.

813
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,360
Bingo!

814
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,400
Shit! You're touched
my laughing valve!

815
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,680
Watch out!

816
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,680
Go away!

817
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,760
Can't you see that I am
playing games with General Tin?

818
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,240
Help me.

819
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,440
Dismiss!

820
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,560
Bingo!

821
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,680
Your laughing valve
is attacked again.

822
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,080
Brother Tin, Brother Tin, hold on.

823
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:39,680
It's nonsense,
let's play something else.

824
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,200
You listen,
we'll play something else.

825
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,560
We'll rehearse the declaration of
war on Asia the Invincible tomorrow.

826
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,640
But you'd better call me
Asia the Invincible now.

827
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,000
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts! Come on!

828
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,920
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts!

829
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,960
Unbeaten! Asia the Invincible!

830
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,360
Officer Koo, Hurrah! Hurrah!

831
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,360
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts.

832
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,240
Unbeaten! Asia the Invincible!

833
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,800
Officer Koo, Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

834
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,920
We can't escape from the war.

835
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,000
Even we're going to die. I want to
die by the side of Asia the Invincible.

836
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,840
Thank you for let me go.

837
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,440
Snow, you go and look for
Asia the Invincible now.

838
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,240
But, I don't want to
see you again in the battlefield.

839
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,680
What's the matter?

840
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,240
Chin, are you crazy?

841
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,480
I don't want you to become
another Asia the invincible.

842
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,480
When I am lonely.

843
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,200
I hope a fried to accompany me.

844
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,080
We can get him back to Black Cliff.

845
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,760
Then we should
find ways to defeat her.

846
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,720
The Spanish, are you still
looking for the Sacred Scroll?

847
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,000
Who are you?

848
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,880
Do you know
where's the Sacred Scroll?

849
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,600
You've asked the correct person!
I am Asia the Invincible.

850
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,880
Asia the Invincible?

851
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,640
You are powerful because of this?

852
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,920
Your science. Is shit.

853
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,080
Armour?

854
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,040
What power did your God give you?

855
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,600
This is our holy cup.

856
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,240
Your God is useless!

857
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,680
Kneel down!

858
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,880
Your Bible should be re-written.

859
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,320
From now on.

860
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,960
The God mentioned
in your western Bible...

861
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,560
Should be re-written
as Asia the Invincible.

862
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,400
Come on, let's in prayer.

863
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:02,680
Holy Asia the Invincible,
Holy Asia the Invincible.

864
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,120
Hand the flag of the
Sun Moon Sect at the bow.

865
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,800
- Keep on temping Asia the Invincible.
- Yes, Sir!

866
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,760
Anything special?

867
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,080
Nothing.

868
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,880
General Mo Yan Lu Chong, Liu Seng

869
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,080
And all other Japanese ninjas.

870
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,320
We are get ready to fight.

871
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,120
Let's go!

872
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,960
Today, I want to show you something,

873
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,560
which you've never seen before,
that's my real face.

874
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,160
Look!

875
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,040
Are you surprised?

876
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,080
Can you imagine the
invincible General Mo Yan Lu Chong,

877
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,880
is a hooker in the camp
of the wanderers?

878
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,120
You must be having some bad feeling.

879
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,160
Since you have been
deceived for a long time.

880
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:27,920
You don't know...

881
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,200
who is the master behind.

882
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,640
Let me tell you.

883
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,600
The real name of Mo Yan Lu Chong
is Asia the Invincible.

884
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,560
I have got the military order.

885
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,400
Who goes against me should be killed.

886
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,920
Attention.

887
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,560
Let's go ahead.
We'll join with the Spanish warship...

888
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,800
to unite the world.

889
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,680
Since the people can't forget me.

890
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,120
I'll lead the troops
to declare war again.

891
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,240
I will change my name to
"Asia and Europe the Invincible".

892
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,280
- Raise the banner.
- Yes!

893
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:11,320
"Asia and Europe the invincible"

894
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,600
Sir, a warship is found ahead.

895
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,320
This is the Mo Yan
warship of the Japanese.

896
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:21,720
Sir,

897
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,080
the Japanese and the Spanish warship

898
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,640
raised their banners.

899
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,240
They declare war on us.

900
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,320
What?

901
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,600
It's strange, why do the
Japanese and the Spanish...

902
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,400
declare war on us?

903
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,360
Raise our flag and declare war.

904
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,560
"Koo"

905
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,000
Fire.

906
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,440
Report, Koo's banner is hanging on
the warship of Ming Dynasty.

907
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,160
Fire to them to show our trench!
Declare war now.

908
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,840
Koo's banner.

909
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,200
It's Koo!

910
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,800
Instruct the Spanish warship
to attack the warship of Ming Dynasty.

911
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,920
- Check the ship!
- Yes!

912
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,640
Koo, you are great!

913
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,120
Fine, let's sink into the water.

914
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,520
Sir,

915
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,160
the Japanese ship
disappears suddenly.

916
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,600
It's a submarine.

917
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,640
Bet there is much undercurrent here.

918
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,760
If they sail below the sea,

919
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,960
their route will be hindered.

920
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,760
That's what I want.

921
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,800
Pour the paint into the water
to disturb their view.

922
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,840
Yes. Execute now!

923
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,080
Sir, our route is hindered
by the submerged rocks.

924
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,720
The Ming Dynasty Navy
poured the paints into the sea.

925
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,440
Visibility is poor, we can't move.

926
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,960
You want to trap us
at the bottom of the sea?

927
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,760
Fine, bomb the submerged rocks
with the mine.

928
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,040
Yes.

929
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,400
Report, the Spanish warship
is approaching us in full speed.

930
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,320
it seems that they want to crash
against us, please give instruction.

931
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,680
- Lower the sail.
- Lower the sail in full speed.

932
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,120
Yes!

933
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,600
Lower the sail.

934
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,760
Get ready the war.

935
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,080
Koo, you have been
exhausted in the fighting.

936
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,120
Asia the Invincible
hasn't shown up yet.

937
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,320
Chin, I tell you.

938
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,640
The wish of everybody,

939
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,360
is to meet the strongest enemy
before his death.

940
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,640
If he were the leader of the enemy.

941
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,120
It's too early to say
who'll be the winner.

942
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,080
Report,
the body of the ship is damaged.

943
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,600
We'd emerge from the sea at once.

944
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,560
Koo must be waiting for me.

945
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,440
Well, let's go up.

946
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,960
Asia the Invincible!

947
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,000
Focus the top of their sail.

948
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,680
Asia the Invincible,
you show up eventually.

949
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,000
Get ready the cannon!

950
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,920
Asia the Invincible?

951
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,640
But you are not better than me
at leading the troops.

952
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,520
You've got the magic power
from "Sacred Scroll".

953
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,400
Although this is
your personal achievement,

954
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,360
it can't make you
achieve great success.

955
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,080
That's why your troops didn't attack,

956
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,200
but were destroyed
at the Black Cliff.

957
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,360
Bull shit!

958
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,520
My failure was caused
by my foe whom I admired.

959
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,640
I didn't want to hurt him,

960
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,280
thus I pretended that
I was kill Dundee the cliff.

961
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:58,280
Last time, you could escape
because of the "Sacred Scroll".

962
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,520
Now, the history is repeated.

963
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:03,520
If you had not had the luck
to adopt the "Sacred Scroll",

964
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,480
you'd not have escaped
from my attack.

965
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,680
You're qualified to be
a great martial arts master only.

966
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,040
But being a king or a great general,

967
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,520
You are not qualified
to be named a sassier the Invincible.

968
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,160
I want to be king, I have to recruit
a great general first.

969
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,760
I want you to be my general,
so I will show you my power.

970
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,360
If I had practiced the Sacred Scroll.

971
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,840
You'd not have defeated me.

972
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,040
Anyway, our fight
should have been over.

973
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,800
You're wrong!
Our fight has not been over yet.

974
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,560
Give it to me.

975
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,600
It's too easy to defeat you.

976
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:59,240
Your 14 valves
are both live and dead.

977
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,200
Let me open your closed valves.

978
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,000
Your Kung-fu will be improved greatly,

979
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,240
so you are able to fight with me.

980
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,080
Koo, watch it.

981
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,880
Snow, I said...

982
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,040
I didn't hope to see you
in the battlefield again.

983
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,880
I want to see Asia the Invincible.

984
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,520
Snow!

985
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,120
Snow, I will save you.

986
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:04,480
Only Asia the invincible can save me.

987
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,720
Snow, come back to me now.

988
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,000
Holy Master.

989
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,760
Do you think it's worth doing it?

990
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,760
I have waited for this moment.

991
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,120
I know you come for me.

992
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,400
Koo, get lost.

993
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,000
Koo, return Snow to me.

994
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,560
I won't return her to you.

995
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,880
Come to get her yourself.

996
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:32,280
Asia the Invincible,
you are always alone.

997
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,000
Why do you follow me?

998
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,240
Don't go!

999
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,720
Snow, no matter how,

1000
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,480
I have to take you back.

1001
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:09,640
But what a pity that,
you could never hear what he said.

1002
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,680
Otherwise, you'd be very happy.

1003
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,120
Hand her to me.

1004
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,000
Asia the Invincible,
it's useless for anything you said.

1005
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,560
She could never hear you.

1006
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,320
You are lying!

1007
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,560
You have never trusted anybody.

1008
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,360
You've made it.

1009
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,840
But you have got no one
to stay with you.

1010
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,080
Asia the Invincible, you always
want to search for yourself.

1011
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,920
Actually, what you have done,

1012
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,840
either good or bad, that's you.

1013
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,440
I don't need you to tell me.

1014
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,280
What a pity that, you are always
making remedy to what you've lost.

1015
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,080
But, you never treasure
the things you've gained.

1016
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,920
I want you to lose
what you have gained.

1017
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,800
Well, but I want her back now.

1018
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:55,240
Snow. Let's start
from the very beginning.

1019
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,160
Asia the Invincible.
