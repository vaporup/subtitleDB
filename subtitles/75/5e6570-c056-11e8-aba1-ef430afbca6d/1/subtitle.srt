1
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,951
Please have tea.
Don't be formal.

2
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:43,532
Brother Hua, what we got today

3
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:46,034
is through violence.

4
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,297
But now the situation's different.

5
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:51,500
We can't go on with
killing and arson, can we?

6
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:53,541
It makes sense.

7
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,510
Brother Hua, let's come to the point.

8
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:58,914
Two days ago your men
seized our cargo in Hsi Sha.

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,016
Nonsense.

10
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:06,350
Brother Hua,
you don't accept liability?

11
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:08,254
Yes, why not?

12
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:09,383
How much are you going to pay?

13
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:12,158
The cargo can't be sold

14
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:14,460
without refining, Feng.

15
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:17,565
Learn a lesson from it.
Hua Hsien-wu, you...

16
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:24,775
So you took two lives
on a moment's impulse.

17
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:28,370
Only a misunderstanding.
Don't kill me!

18
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,347
Don't kill me, Brother Hua!

19
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:35,644
OK, I won't kill you.

20
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:38,586
Thank you, Brother Hua.

21
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:44,791
Brother Hua,
you promised not to kill me.

22
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,354
I didn't.

23
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,970
Boss, what now?

24
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,706
You're jobless.
Come and work for me tomorrow.

25
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:02,610
Thank you, Boss. Thank you, Boss.

26
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,420
- Money?
- What do you mean?

27
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,722
I want to give you some money.

28
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,261
Under what conditions?

29
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:19,854
Cheng wants you to forget this.

30
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:22,660
I won't, I must finish him off.

31
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,367
Rape me.

32
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,235
Listen, I'm doing it for your own good.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,240
Why?

34
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,070
You'll lose for sure in this case.

35
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:34,075
So, instead of offending a ruffian

36
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,671
Why not keep this and win a friend?

37
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:39,181
You're not judge.

38
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,585
Let's see who the winner is.

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,581
Mr. Lung, it seems you're
also good for nothing.

40
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:47,682
Who are you?

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,556
They're all Cheng's men.

42
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,563
Bitch, you're cocky.

43
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,297
Don't try anything foolish.

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,800
Mr. Lung, mind your
own business, OK?

45
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:04,005
Enough.

46
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,235
It's none of your business.

47
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:19,481
Help!

48
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:30,525
Help!

49
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,376
Come out!

50
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:45,976
Don't...

51
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,313
Go and tell Cheng.

52
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,220
Are you all right?

53
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,793
Stop acting in conspiracy with them.

54
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:04,630
Acting?

55
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:14,040
Objection. Counsel imputed
the plaintiff's morals.

56
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:20,718
A dancing hostess

57
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,310
makes an honest living.

58
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:26,217
In real life, bad morals are free.

59
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:27,224
Objection overruled.

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,158
To save time and taxpayers' money.

61
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,231
The Defendant pleads
nolo contendere.

62
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,527
Please acquit him...

63
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,594
by awarding him

64
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:40,966
benefit of the doubt.

65
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,402
Legally

66
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,841
the Defendant didn't
rape the Plaintiff

67
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,677
but ethically, he was wrong.

68
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,577
Objection. Defense is misleading.

69
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,084
The Court observes law, not ethics.

70
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,185
Objection sustained.

71
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:58,587
Clerk needn't take
Defense Counsel's last words.

72
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:00,953
Your Honor,
I've finished my presentation.

73
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,299
Arise, Defendant Mao Shih Cheng.

74
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:14,500
Before pronouncing

75
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:18,471
I must thank both counsels.

76
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,011
Prosecution's presentation
is terse and to the point.

77
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:25,946
Defense's nolo contendere saved time.

78
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,677
This I appreciate very much.

79
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,020
This Court now finds
Defendant not guilty.

80
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,353
The case does not have to be
referred to Supreme Court.

81
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:36,994
Defendant is released forthwith.
Dismissed.

82
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,496
Court

83
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:45,633
Thank you, Counsel Lung.

84
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:01,845
You used violence in Court.

85
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,388
Even if the victim doesn't sue,
the Court will.

86
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:05,353
I know.

87
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,356
Why did you commit it then?

88
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,824
Are you my boss or my assistant?

89
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,861
I'm your assistant
appointed by your Boss.

90
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:12,360
Where are you going?

91
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,898
Court two to handle
a wife-beating case.

92
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,298
- What then?
- To have lunch.

93
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,631
Me, too. How about joining me?

94
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:20,168
What do you mean by that?

95
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:21,898
It means 'yes'.
Let's have lunch together.

96
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,338
See you at the entrance at 12 noon.

97
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:24,875
Bye-bye.

98
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,973
Let's go. Where are we?

99
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:31,842
I said, I'm your assistant
appointed by your Boss.

100
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:35,448
Such a simple question
shouldn't be asked here.

101
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,386
- Where are you going?
- Go to the toilet.

102
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,186
- What then?
- Get out of the toilet.

103
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:41,418
- What then?
- Say it yourself.

104
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:42,788
- How about having coffee?
- OK.

105
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:43,954
I haven't seen you around these days.

106
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:45,188
Only because you seldom
came to see me.

107
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,262
- See you later.
- OK.

108
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:47,956
Bye.

109
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:49,898
Romeo.

110
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,763
Let's go.

111
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,102
Boss.

112
00:06:58,244 --> 00:06:59,939
Hello, Miss Yeh.

113
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:04,613
Have you made up
your mind over that?

114
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:09,286
I want no compensation.
I want your factory to stop production

115
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,853
till the drainage system
has been improved.

116
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,789
If the dirty water

117
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,690
keeps pouring into my pond

118
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:17,392
all my fish will die.

119
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,130
How much is your pond? I'll buy it.

120
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,666
My fish pond is not for sale.

121
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:25,326
You don't sound like a businessman.

122
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,368
Even in business one must've ethics.

123
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:29,998
Don't disrupt ecology or pollute...

124
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,478
I can't quite follow you.

125
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:38,106
Miss Yeh, I know business only

126
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:39,912
and nothing else.

127
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,422
Well, show me your bill and I'll pay.

128
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,685
Our factory can't stop production.

129
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,926
How much is your factory? I'll buy it.

130
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,521
Let's close the subject now.

131
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:55,032
I'll apply to the
Court for an injunction.

132
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,730
See you in Court, Miss Yeh.

133
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,608
- Boss, let me bump her off.
- Shut up!

134
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,916
Get a new lawyer
to play along with her.

135
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,690
The hearing will go on indefinitely.

136
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,224
Don't let production slow down.

137
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:23,157
Yes.

138
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,027
- Have tea.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,923
Lawyer Wen, it's been a long time.

140
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:30,295
Why didn't I see you
at the races lately?

141
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:31,733
I've been out at sea most of the time.

142
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:32,934
Let me make the introductions.

143
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,466
This is Miss Wen

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,234
a lecturer of geography
and ecology at HKU.

145
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,207
She's the chief witness in our case.

146
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:40,367
How do you do?

147
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:42,913
This is Lawyer Lung
in charge of this case.

148
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,414
How do you do?

149
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:48,853
- Lawyer Wen, let's come to the point.
- Good.

150
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:51,648
All data on it.

151
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,584
Can this case be settled
outside the Court, sir?

152
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:57,321
Yes, if your client's factory
stops production

153
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,158
till the drainage system is improved.

154
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,926
My client will pay
any price, but stoppage.

155
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:06,266
My client will pay
any price for stoppage.

156
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:09,001
Good, both our stand-points are clear.

157
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,097
Right

158
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:14,612
win or loss, we lawyers
get paid anyway.

159
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:17,771
Miss Wen

160
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,975
What standard you used
to determine water quality?

161
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:23,213
The 1986 Standard of the
Commonwealth Health Organization.

162
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,551
Commonwealth? How complicated?

163
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,115
Sure

164
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:29,419
I spend years abroad on this subject.

165
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,520
Let's have lunch when you're free.

166
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:34,427
I want to get an idea of this Standard.

167
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:38,335
I've put all data on it.

168
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,367
Good, that's all for now.

169
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,031
I must rush to Court.

170
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:48,839
Have tea with me when you have time.

171
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:51,210
Good. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

172
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,217
- Let me see her out.
- Thank you.

173
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,119
You get one more case
if you attend Court later.

174
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:04,559
Miss Wen, where are you going?

175
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:06,063
- The library.
- What then?

176
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:07,290
Have lunch.

177
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,366
Me, too. Let's have lunch together.

178
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,633
- Sorry.
- Why not?

179
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:14,032
I'm used to eating alone?

180
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,730
Me, too.

181
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,968
I hate company.

182
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,907
Let's go and have Japanese food.

183
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:22,012
- Sorry.
- Korean food then.

184
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,449
I won't have lunch with you.

185
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:30,650
Only lunch and nothing else.

186
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:37,527
Haven't you had enough from her?

187
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:42,595
Hasn't she turned your stomach?

188
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:55,944
All guns here are powerful.

189
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:59,074
This .38 is commonly used by CID.

190
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:00,980
$700, less 10%.

191
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:05,980
This .45 Colt must be
known to your comrade.

192
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,719
$1,200 each. And...

193
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:15,023
This M177 is an automatic rifle.

194
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,634
One cartridge of 15 bullets
and some more.

195
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,294
Even police may get scared.

196
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:21,337
Can they be cheated as real?

197
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:22,599
No?

198
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,506
Sounds, fire, shells, like real.

199
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:30,841
We'll take them all.

200
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:32,411
Thank you.

201
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,612
Less 20%, it's $77,000.

202
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:38,321
What do you say, fatty?

203
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:42,259
Sorry, cash only, no credit.

204
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:44,826
We were introduced
by Brother Cheng.

205
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,861
I gave him no discount

206
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,398
for that grenade deal.

207
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,001
Would we rob if
we had so much money?

208
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:54,130
You can't rob without money.

209
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,004
Fine.

210
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,276
$15 for one slicer.
Buy one, take one free.

211
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,249
Fatty

212
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,752
don't you know us
revolutionary warriors?

213
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,262
You bastards try to bully me.

214
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,659
You know what I did
before I sell guns?

215
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,231
I was a fight instructor.

216
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:46,921
Wang Fei-hsiung?
What are you doing?

217
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,152
I've just finished fighting.

218
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,662
Fighting? See you at same
old place in half an hour.

219
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,756
Anything good?

220
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:57,358
It's the real thing.

221
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,462
Is it all here?

222
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,905
That fish pond's worth $10 million.

223
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:04,098
15% commission, that's a good deal.

224
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,336
Not bad, but it's no easy money.

225
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,269
If it was, I wouldn't
have come to you.

226
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:13,245
Let's go.

227
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:15,683
Go now.

228
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,051
Miss Yeh, don't!

229
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,054
Don't let me see you again

230
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:21,591
or I'll douse you with fuel.

231
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,787
This fish pond is not for sale.

232
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:28,224
Can it be fixed up?

233
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,800
No problem. Let's go back.

234
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:27,457
- I'm...
- You're a thief.

235
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:31,790
I'm Jackie.

236
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:33,892
Don't!

237
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:36,659
Don't!

238
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,432
I'm...

239
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:48,378
- See who I'm.
- Who are you?

240
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,311
You can't recognize me
at this distance? I'm Jackie.

241
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,212
I can't.

242
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,544
I'm...

243
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:57,749
- I'm what I'm.
- Jackie?

244
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,187
I already said I'm Jackie.

245
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:02,585
What are you doing?

246
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,454
What's it?

247
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:05,757
Just now I saw a man.

248
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:07,993
It was me.

249
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,266
What are you doing here?

250
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:11,892
I'm looking for your switch.

251
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,301
You can't find it?

252
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:17,903
Care for coffee?

253
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,089
Why do you want to see me?

254
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,866
I want your skill to bug a house.

255
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:53,010
Do you keep fish like that?

256
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:57,307
Don't add sugar or milk.

257
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:01,480
It may pollute coffee. Understand?

258
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:04,183
Yes.

259
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:07,957
What did you say?

260
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,830
- I want you to help me...
- The last sentence.

261
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:16,433
I asked,
"Why do you keep fish like that?"

262
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:19,162
Fish is the symbol of my life.

263
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:22,637
To forge ahead without turning back.

264
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,274
Why do you want to see me?

265
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,604
I want you to fix a bug for me.

266
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,974
Take a rest.

267
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,317
Birds are the disciples of capitalism.

268
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:37,154
Fish are the disciples of communism.

269
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:40,624
The two doctrines are different.
Understand?

270
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:43,794
No, I only know you're killing them.

271
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:44,692
Why do you want to see me?

272
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:48,699
I want you to fix a bug for me.

273
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,794
That's not an ethical thing to do.

274
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:56,606
Better let me stab a knife in his neck

275
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,709
and make him tell you everything.

276
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:03,337
Good idea, but don't do anything.

277
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,579
Forget that I've come here.

278
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:07,207
I can't.

279
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,318
We're friends.
Your business is my business.

280
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,984
I'll help you for sure.
Why do you want to see me?

281
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:22,325
I wanted you to help me fix a bug.

282
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:25,297
Are you serious?

283
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:27,268
I was.

284
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:31,303
The pressure of life
has made you a bit cranky.

285
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:32,569
Yes.

286
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:56,928
Hell with you!
Who are you looking for?

287
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:00,103
Who are you?
Why are you in my house?

288
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,400
Your house? Which one is yours.

289
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,133
Block A, No. 9, Lo Yang Road.

290
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,803
This is Block B, next is Block A.

291
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,978
Sorry, I made a mistake.

292
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:18,421
You're careless.

293
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:20,683
Sorry, I'm new here.

294
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,783
I won't be so careless again.

295
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,025
- Are you all right?
- Sorry.

296
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:26,954
Let me help you,
you have so much luggage.

297
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,825
Thank you.

298
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,337
Sorry for troubling you.

299
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,212
Don't mention it. We're neighbors.

300
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:47,345
Stay a little longer.

301
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:50,315
No, thanks.

302
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,014
- Have a cup of tea.
- No, thanks.

303
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:55,992
No?

304
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,252
No. Bye-bye.

305
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,265
Bye-bye.

306
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:07,264
Don't worry, we're now friends.

307
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:09,499
We may end up close friends.

308
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:20,609
Can't we settle our dispute

309
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:22,151
outside Court?

310
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:25,119
If we could.

311
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,521
I wouldn't have applied
for an injunction.

312
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,054
A lawsuit is a tedious process.

313
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:30,684
Did you achieve anything?

314
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:35,089
Their lawyer asked me to dinner.

315
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,764
It doesn't count for much.

316
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:39,166
It would mean much if he invited me to.

317
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,463
Cousin, don't have inferiority complex.

318
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,631
I don't, but I'm an idiot.

319
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,002
I was supercilious when I was young.

320
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,677
I'm serious, for I'm your cousin.

321
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:53,580
A middle-aged girl without a boyfriend.

322
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:54,982
You mustn't expect too much.

323
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,079
I have no more choice.

324
00:19:57,623 --> 00:19:59,818
Any man, healthy, with good features

325
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,289
of any size will suit me.

326
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,757
Employed or not is immaterial.

327
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,254
Ideals of no ideals are immaterial.

328
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:06,489
Responsibility or
no responsibility is immaterial.

329
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,091
Any man will suit you then?

330
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,632
Any man will suit you then?

331
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:13,098
Yes. The only condition
is 'no big potbelly'.

332
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:29,116
March forward. Watch out
for the enemy. Be alert.

333
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,150
Brave all difficulties.

334
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,457
March forward.

335
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:53,441
Did you say 'yes' to that lawyer?

336
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:56,636
Why don't you say 'yes' to him?

337
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:58,472
Why should I?

338
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:00,381
At least you'll get an idea

339
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,042
of his trick.

340
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:04,253
Right?

341
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,752
Ling, come and help me.

342
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:01,378
Oh, no, this shouldn't get wet.

343
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:06,807
A burglar? Don't move.

344
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,011
Trying to run?

345
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:10,753
I'll kill you.

346
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,318
Come down.

347
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:16,250
You can't escape from me.

348
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,656
Nor slip through my fingers.

349
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,896
What's it?

350
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:24,360
What are you doing?

351
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,303
I caught this burglar.

352
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,267
Burglar.

353
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,838
Call the police now.

354
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,215
It's all right, I've fixed him at last.

355
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,748
Which of you is the burglar?

356
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,411
This is Mr. Wang, a new neighbor.

357
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:46,217
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

358
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:47,585
Don't mention it.

359
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,159
We're neighbors.

360
00:23:00,772 --> 00:23:02,467
- How careless.
- How's everything?

361
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,165
Bail out. Go now.

362
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,005
Do I have to go to jail?
I can't stand it.

363
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:13,083
I can't even breathe in jail.

364
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:14,216
Fix it for me now.

365
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,148
OK.

366
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:16,777
Only because I didn't help you

367
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:17,944
you won't care to fix this for me?

368
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:19,579
OK, go now.

369
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,157
You may leave now.

370
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,887
Thank you.

371
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,091
Take the lift now.

372
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:32,568
Lift? I can't.

373
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:34,329
I can't breathe. I'll take the stairs.

374
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:35,963
OK, take the stairs.

375
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,538
Go now. I'll come to see you later.

376
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,848
- What a coincidence.
- Oh, yes.

377
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,920
Lawyer Lung, representing
Hua Chemical Works.

378
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,315
Hua Chemical Works.

379
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:57,825
My cousin is the Boss of Yeh Fish Pond.

380
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:59,357
Nice to see you.

381
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:01,223
Yes, but not at the Police Station.

382
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,295
And we're going to meet in Court too.

383
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:05,492
Yes.

384
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:10,171
Miss Wen, wonder if...

385
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:11,502
Want to ask someone to lunch again?

386
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,266
Yes, is it OK?

387
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:14,775
Are you dating her or me?

388
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,813
Stare at her if you're dating her.

389
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,284
Sorry, not lunch.

390
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,084
What about supper?

391
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:27,521
OK, give me your phone number.

392
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,789
I'll call you and pick you up later.

393
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,126
Phone number?

394
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,860
Bite it, your hands are busy.

395
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:51,545
Thank you.

396
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,378
It's more comfortable.

397
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:04,194
Sit here, it's more comfortable.

398
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:06,460
No, it's not bad here either.

399
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:10,829
Impossible, let me try.

400
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:22,270
Oh, I didn't discover that before.

401
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:25,305
- Let's have a drink.
- OK.

402
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:41,695
Did you drug my wine?

403
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,734
I feel a bit drunk.

404
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:46,803
The wine has just
entered the stomach.

405
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:52,006
And part of it has entered the head.

406
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:56,639
Feel it. Any fever?

407
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,271
No.

408
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,409
Perhaps it's a case of self-indulgence.

409
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:05,215
More like a case of infatuation.

410
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:11,958
- I'm Tung Te-piao.
- What do you want?

411
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:13,360
I'm now in your room.

412
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:15,326
In your room.

413
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,366
Don't move around if you're unwell.

414
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:19,493
I'm chatting with a friend. That's all.

415
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,372
Where are we?

416
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:32,246
I'll go out if you don't come in.

417
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,840
Don't.

418
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:37,544
I'll come in right away. OK?

419
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:44,291
I forgot to go in to get
something for you.

420
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,425
Excuse me.

421
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:55,995
How did you get in?

422
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:57,573
Over there. I just climbed in.

423
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:59,175
Not so loud.

424
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,005
- I want to ask you a question.
- Come on.

425
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:03,410
How could a nice man like me

426
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,105
so loyal to friends and a social elite

427
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,650
dedicated to the community

428
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:10,811
meet with frustrations
and mental ravages?

429
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:13,480
I'll repeat that question.

430
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:18,119
Jackie, it's for you.

431
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,624
Coming.

432
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,895
I'll answer you later.

433
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,092
Now stand a little back.

434
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,195
So it is her.

435
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:27,496
Thank you.

436
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,440
- Where are you, Jackie?
- At home.

437
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:36,009
You promised to bring me something.

438
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:37,613
Yes.

439
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,478
I'll go and get it now.

440
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:44,847
So you're with the
woman who sued me.

441
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:46,851
You need no bugs to seduce a girl.

442
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:49,926
Frankly,
what's the name of the game?

443
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:52,128
What about my future?

444
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,630
And you haven't
answered my first question.

445
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,897
Give me one more night's time.

446
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,901
After I'm yours

447
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,367
ask any questions, OK?

448
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:03,029
Follow the original track. Get going.

449
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,967
Get going.

450
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,474
Where's it?

451
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:12,345
Oh, no, it was not in the room.

452
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:13,678
Guess what I have brought you?

453
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:15,582
All I need now is the toilet.

454
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:18,588
Toilet? Over there.

455
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,091
You still put the key

456
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,659
under the carpet.

457
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:34,361
The line was cut off

458
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,029
so I've come personally.

459
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:37,697
I'm now the neighbor of
the fishpond boss.

460
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:39,969
And I've cultivated
some friendship with her.

461
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:41,009
You're now her neighbor?

462
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,637
Bad, one of the women
is now in my home.

463
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,514
Why are you
switching off the lights?

464
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:52,920
Isn't that more romantic?

465
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,419
I think it's better
to have the lights on.

466
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,622
Just switch on the small lights then.

467
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:07,999
Let's enjoy our candle-lit dinner.

468
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,040
- What happened?
- Let me see.

469
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:28,623
What happened?

470
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,455
A dog has run down a lamp.

471
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,218
Is that so?

472
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,230
What a beautiful dress.
Where did you buy it.

473
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:38,229
When I was a student in Canada.

474
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:42,868
Let me hang it for you
to avoid getting creased.

475
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:48,744
No.

476
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:52,176
- Thank you.
- No need.

477
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:11,757
What sound is that?

478
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,562
The wood bursts due to
the dry weather.

479
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,735
Thank you.

480
00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:22,773
This steak is OK.

481
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:33,282
I should've replace
this cupboard last week.

482
00:30:33,424 --> 00:30:35,016
Now it has burst.

483
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,650
Don't let it spoil the atmosphere.

484
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,104
Damn you burglar.

485
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:56,643
You burglarized my neighbor

486
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,304
and now my friend.

487
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:10,026
Bastard, arrest me.

488
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,744
I must switch off my radio.

489
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,480
- You bastard.
- You're a bastard.

490
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:38,850
Don't...

491
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:40,356
- He was trying to burglarize.
- Damn you.

492
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:41,287
How dare you?

493
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:42,484
He's my friend.

494
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:43,525
Your friend?

495
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:45,323
I caught him burglarizing last night.

496
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,829
I told him to fix
a bugging device for me.

497
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:48,157
- Is he really your friend?
- Yes.

498
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,095
He's your friend

499
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:50,256
and so is that girl outside.

500
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:52,096
You told me to fix
a bug in your friend's home

501
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,295
then told him to take me.

502
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:54,234
I'm your friend.

503
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,531
Why do that to me?

504
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:59,775
Only a misunderstanding.
Please don't fight.

505
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,367
I'll explain

506
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:02,945
after I drive her away.

507
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:08,675
Stare at me. Don't fight.
I'll be back right away.

508
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:11,413
Don't fight!

509
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:14,786
Don't fight!

510
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:17,385
- Must fight.
- Violence?

511
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:18,825
Again?

512
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:26,359
How nice. You've had enough.

513
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:28,669
You don't like steak?

514
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,330
Next time we'll take something else.

515
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:33,567
Go back now.

516
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:35,942
- I haven't eaten anything.
- All right.

517
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:39,382
Bye-bye. Let's eat again
some other day.

518
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:49,520
Stop fighting.

519
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,889
Stop that, will you?

520
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,137
Sorry.
How did you get a black eye?

521
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:05,605
What? Is it black?

522
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,574
No. What happened?

523
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:10,239
- I've left a coat here.
- Wait.

524
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,415
Don't fight.

525
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:24,493
Why is your nose bleeding?

526
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,324
Is it?

527
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,831
You're drunk. Bye-bye.

528
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:32,594
Stop fighting.

529
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,309
Stop fighting.

530
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:00,495
What now?

531
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:02,360
I should have asked you.

532
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,797
I don't know.

533
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:06,802
Anyway, seduce that
old maid as planned.

534
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:08,962
Have her sell her
fish pond and we get 20%.

535
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,265
There are other things

536
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,740
more valuable.

537
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,309
Right, gold, silver,
diamond, antiques...

538
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:18,474
I mean righteousness and freedom.

539
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:19,641
What do you mean?

540
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,843
Quiet...

541
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,721
Don't worry. At worst I'll beg them

542
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:27,518
to withdraw the complaint.

543
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,115
Is it worthwhile?

544
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,951
Is it worthwhile if you get a hole

545
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,324
in your head for this?

546
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:37,333
You may get jailed
for misbehaviour in public.

547
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:41,394
Don't scare me with that.
Look, litter everywhere.

548
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,234
Snakes, rats and nonsense.

549
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:49,336
It's so bad to live in the last days.

550
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,675
And it's worse still to get jailed.

551
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:54,049
Sorry.

552
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:55,708
Why have you hired such a man?

553
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,619
Don't point at me like that.

554
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:58,982
What do you mean?

555
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,284
I don't mean anything.

556
00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:02,415
Don't say anything meaningless to me.

557
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:04,584
Care for you.

558
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,988
He was not like that before.

559
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:09,765
You've changed much.

560
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:13,093
Life's meaningless without changes.

561
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:15,632
To ask meaningless questions

562
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:16,704
like he does?

563
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:20,905
Cool down. Have a cup.
Have some tea.

564
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:25,741
- Boss Hua, this way please.
- Please.

565
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:31,219
Now everybody will be OK.

566
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:32,914
- Jackie, so you're here.
- What a coincidence.

567
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,489
I'm buttonholed by Boss Hua.

568
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:35,714
It's won't be boring you're here

569
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,952
I'll make the introduction.

570
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:40,086
You go first, I'll come right away.

571
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:41,495
Please wait.

572
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:47,465
Well, let's go together.
Let's go together.

573
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:52,606
Boss Hua.

574
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:55,936
Let me introduce Jackie,
my lawyer's partner.

575
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:57,344
He's handling your case.

576
00:35:57,415 --> 00:36:00,316
Boss Hua.
Nice to see you, lawyer Lung.

577
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,352
I count on you for
the future of my factory.

578
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,319
I'll do my best.

579
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:06,717
They help me on your case.

580
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:12,123
Boss Hua, thanks for the patronage.

581
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:15,192
You've no worries

582
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,698
with Jackie handling your case.

583
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,229
Good. Please.

584
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:21,668
We're scooping up evidence

585
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,730
on your opponent.

586
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:25,138
Boss, something wrong.

587
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:31,241
What's his background?

588
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,950
Child Worshipping Goddess!
Are you convinced?

589
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,858
Don't fight.

590
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,614
Don't block my sight.

591
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:30,773
Stop that!

592
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,142
Let's go.

593
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,018
- Don't go! Don't fight any more?
- Forget it.

594
00:37:48,492 --> 00:37:52,189
Sorry to get you involved.

595
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,128
My looks are damned.

596
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:56,164
Mistaken?

597
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,962
You're surrounded
by men and violence.

598
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:01,536
You must be up to no good.

599
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:05,841
Stay!

600
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:07,838
Sorry, my friend's drunk.

601
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,980
Never mind. You three are OK.

602
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:13,673
Luckily you work for me.

603
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:16,978
Otherwise...

604
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:20,723
Don't say you're my men,

605
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,517
or I'll lose face.

606
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,251
We didn't know
they got two good men.

607
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:27,591
They made you bumpkins then.

608
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:29,493
Get someone to finish off that lawyer.

609
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,658
There's nothing special about him.

610
00:38:32,136 --> 00:38:34,536
Nothing special? He's good both ways.

611
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,536
Do you need "killer"

612
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,006
tattooed on his face?

613
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:44,878
That ship's beautiful.

614
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:46,946
That ship you're
going to see is prettier.

615
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,456
They're coming.

616
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:07,600
Please.

617
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,437
Come here.

618
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:27,280
Mr. Lung, Miss Wen.

619
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:29,620
Don't you like it?

620
00:39:30,694 --> 00:39:33,788
- Yes, but you're going a bit too far.
- No.

621
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,860
Lunch alone is cut-and-dry.

622
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:38,366
A little variety
makes all the difference.

623
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,203
Jackie.

624
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:46,334
Do you take each lunch this way?

625
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:48,435
Yes, if I'm lunching with you.

626
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:58,515
I don't like so many attendants.

627
00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:00,021
Next time I'll serve you myself.

628
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:01,783
It's an expensive lunch, isn't it?

629
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:03,587
I'll pay for the lunch myself

630
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:06,061
to compensate for
the lack of food at my home.

631
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,720
A lunch alone

632
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,560
will carry you very far.

633
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,363
I'll spend the interest
on my savings then. Cheers.

634
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:27,144
Excuse me.

635
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,913
Take Miss Wen to the ladies' room.

636
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:30,042
Yes

637
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:36,120
Miss Wen,
our Mr. Lung has chartered this.

638
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,750
Like to try the men's room?

639
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:40,829
- No.
- Please.

640
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,567
Miss Wen, please.

641
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:55,604
Up there.

642
00:40:56,947 --> 00:40:58,039
Hurry.

643
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:22,437
What are you doing?

644
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,574
Inside. He's inside.

645
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:44,116
Let's scatter and follow him.

646
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:37,201
Jackie. What happened?

647
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:41,577
So that's the end of our lunch.

648
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:42,610
What?

649
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:45,070
Let's go.

650
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:10,370
The flowers are rotting.

651
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,511
Miss Yeh, come here.

652
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,482
What's it, hero?

653
00:44:21,218 --> 00:44:23,618
There's no award.

654
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:26,383
Take this pot of flower.

655
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,088
One night with you is better.

656
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:32,525
We can eat and talk

657
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:33,857
as much as possible.

658
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,922
We're neighbors, now let's be friends.

659
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,591
Friends are often betrayed.

660
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:42,394
So you prefer to have fewer friends.

661
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,439
I'd rather be betrayed.

662
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:46,167
Your eyes have betrayed you.

663
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,108
They show you're not sincere.

664
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:51,213
You're only interested in girls.

665
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:55,014
I'm interested in
making friends with girls.

666
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,617
Trust my mouth, not my eyes.

667
00:44:57,755 --> 00:44:59,655
It has a scar. Can I trust it?

668
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:03,890
It belongs to my nose only.

669
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:07,021
Anyway

670
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:09,155
I appreciate your invitation. Bye-bye.

671
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:13,064
No need. Anyway you must eat.

672
00:45:13,737 --> 00:45:14,829
Let go.

673
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:18,103
You men care for nothing but...

674
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:19,439
asking girls to dinner or movies.

675
00:45:20,244 --> 00:45:24,146
I have ideals too, but only in heart.

676
00:45:24,248 --> 00:45:26,239
I'll wait for you
at Glass Cafe tonight.

677
00:45:26,717 --> 00:45:27,809
I'm not going.

678
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:31,350
I'll keep on waiting till you arrive.

679
00:45:31,655 --> 00:45:32,952
I won't go.

680
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:37,619
Be sure to come. I'll wait forever

681
00:45:37,728 --> 00:45:39,218
till I see you.

682
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:40,523
I won't go for sure.

683
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:12,627
This one coming is for real.

684
00:46:20,137 --> 00:46:21,627
Miss, I must make a call.

685
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:23,364
I want to make a call too, sir.

686
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:24,770
Go on.

687
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:30,104
You won't last long.

688
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:38,914
A lousy man's unreliable.

689
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:42,755
What do you mean?

690
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:47,228
Look to the right.

691
00:46:48,065 --> 00:46:50,556
You said 'no', but you're here.

692
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:52,326
You're here, but you're not coming in.

693
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,372
Go now, I'll follow you.

694
00:47:06,483 --> 00:47:09,281
Action speaks louder
than words in wooing.

695
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:11,216
Thanks for giving me the chance.

696
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:12,780
I know what's on your mind.

697
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,381
So you wanted to see
if I meant what I said.

698
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:17,459
I mean it.

699
00:47:17,661 --> 00:47:20,653
If you don't trust me, trust yourself.

700
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,788
Can't you see you have appeal?

701
00:47:25,402 --> 00:47:27,597
I'm not talking to you.

702
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:29,001
Don't be so happy.

703
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:31,403
I'm talking to the girl beside you.

704
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:37,409
Don't walk so fast.

705
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:39,378
Lady in black fur.

706
00:47:41,952 --> 00:47:44,147
It doesn't pay to go fast in love.

707
00:47:44,288 --> 00:47:46,085
A chance to others
is a chance to yourself.

708
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:48,384
It takes two to tango, understand.

709
00:47:48,525 --> 00:47:50,925
Lady in scarf without coat

710
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:55,688
stop and think of what I've said.

711
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,629
Stop guessing. I was talking nonsense.

712
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:00,702
Making friends is not so complicated.

713
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:07,437
Have you finished?

714
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:16,747
Don't catch cold.
Sorry, I've gone too far.

715
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:18,879
I do not want...

716
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:21,356
I had no other choice.

717
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:26,859
You're an idiot.

718
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:30,189
Acting in public? I won't be taken in.

719
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:34,001
Where are we going to have dinner?

720
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:36,931
Anywhere.

721
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,033
Excuse me. We must go to eat.

722
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:43,339
Excuse me. We must go to eat.

723
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:45,711
Excuse me...

724
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:19,267
You dated me

725
00:50:19,376 --> 00:50:21,173
in hopes of winning the case only.

726
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:22,901
How about you?

727
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,378
Aren't you doing the same thing too?

728
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:31,446
In fact, win or loss is immaterial.

729
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:33,452
Win or loss, I get paid all the same.

730
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:37,156
But you may never meet
a good girl all your life.

731
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,161
When you do,
she may already be married.

732
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,629
Men, too.

733
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:45,928
Most good men are married.

734
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,637
Don't stare at me.
You're not a good man.

735
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:53,966
Because I'm not married.

736
00:50:59,649 --> 00:51:00,843
What's wrong?

737
00:51:01,485 --> 00:51:03,783
No need to use violence.

738
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:06,749
What now?

739
00:51:07,757 --> 00:51:10,555
Well, what now?

740
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:13,821
Sorry.

741
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,600
Slap me, hit me.

742
00:51:19,069 --> 00:51:20,764
Poke a knife at me.

743
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:22,636
Come on.

744
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:32,778
My own fish only!

745
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:34,180
It's no fun.

746
00:51:35,152 --> 00:51:38,747
The pleasure of fishing is not fishing.

747
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:40,254
But eating fish.

748
00:51:40,657 --> 00:51:44,252
No, the peace of mind

749
00:51:44,794 --> 00:51:48,195
while waiting for fish.

750
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,794
Why have most
fishermen got wrinkles?

751
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,161
Cut it out or I'll get angry.

752
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,615
Ever thought of
selling your fishpond?

753
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:13,711
Why?

754
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:16,989
Sell it and go with me to Australia.

755
00:52:17,127 --> 00:52:21,427
We'll open a ranch and a dairy there.

756
00:52:21,965 --> 00:52:25,958
But don't worry,
we'll spend most of our time.

757
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:28,297
Riding on the verdant pasture.

758
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,335
On the bright horizon.

759
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:40,111
The clouds over
the horse-riding mountain

760
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:47,587
reflect on the peaceful city.

761
00:52:47,857 --> 00:52:56,356
The sickle moon and the peaceful city.

762
00:52:57,601 --> 00:52:59,193
Do you mean to propose?

763
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:05,132
I'm an easygoing person.

764
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:12,144
- Let me tell you a secret.
- Please.

765
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:17,113
My father's will prescribes that...

766
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:20,188
his future son-in-law
shall inherit his fishpond.

767
00:53:23,693 --> 00:53:24,990
Why are you reacting like that?

768
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,756
The secret you tell me

769
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:30,729
is putting a big burden

770
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:32,529
on me.

771
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,471
Impossible. It's my own secret.

772
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:39,197
I never hide anything.

773
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:41,742
I'm not sure if I can keep it.

774
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:43,936
So it has become a big burden to me.

775
00:53:45,115 --> 00:53:46,810
Take it as your own secret then.

776
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,645
My own secret?

777
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,513
Don't you feel better?

778
00:53:56,893 --> 00:54:01,796
Much better.
One's own secret's different.

779
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:12,270
There's an old lady
in that faraway corner.

780
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:43,070
Catch it.

781
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:48,976
I've made a fool of you now.

782
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:50,769
You're evil.

783
00:54:55,118 --> 00:54:57,109
With me here you have no fear.

784
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,713
Go and see what caused
the power failure.

785
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:01,823
Isn't the world beautiful

786
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,017
for us this way?

787
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:04,718
No

788
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:05,759
the food in the fridge rots.

789
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:07,226
The rice and soup

790
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:09,059
are spoiled.

791
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:09,961
And the food in the stove...

792
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:11,556
Go and see why.

793
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:13,032
What can I do?

794
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:15,503
I'm no generator.

795
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:21,299
The main switch's out of order.

796
00:55:34,557 --> 00:55:35,455
Who?

797
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:40,994
Jackie.

798
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:44,097
What is it?

799
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:53,303
Jackie, what's it?

800
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:55,672
It seems someone bad has come in.

801
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:57,109
What now?

802
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,181
Take this to the centre
and count 1,2,3.

803
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:01,613
Open it. Understand?

804
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:04,914
Go now, go quick!

805
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,030
Jackie, what then?

806
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:17,293
Be careful.

807
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:31,143
Tung Te-piao.

808
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:36,884
- Are you out of your mind?
- I am not.

809
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,214
Do you know what you're doing?

810
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,151
Yes, I must finish off all witnesses.

811
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:42,587
Keep away!

812
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,929
- Let go.
- Cousin.

813
00:56:50,133 --> 00:56:51,623
- All right.
- What happened?

814
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:52,928
It's no concern of yours.

815
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:54,526
You're rude.

816
00:56:54,737 --> 00:56:56,034
But you're a beast.

817
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:58,005
You lured her to
make her sell her fishpond.

818
00:56:58,975 --> 00:57:00,374
Fei, what's he talking about?

819
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:03,406
He's muttering nonsense.

820
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:05,145
I'll tell it even if you kill me.

821
00:57:05,281 --> 00:57:07,579
Don't!

822
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:10,976
- Listen to my explanation.
- Don't listen to him.

823
00:57:11,187 --> 00:57:12,381
Will you just keep quiet?

824
00:57:12,455 --> 00:57:14,355
You should keep quiet yourself.

825
00:57:14,524 --> 00:57:16,014
You told me to fix a bug.

826
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:16,955
When I failed and got prosecuted

827
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:18,525
you double-crossed me.

828
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:20,321
I see.

829
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,024
Don't listen to him.
He's talking nonsense.

830
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:26,524
Listen to me, Ling.

831
00:57:26,669 --> 00:57:27,465
Listen.

832
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,265
Things are not
as complicated as you thought.

833
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:30,237
It's very simple.

834
00:57:30,406 --> 00:57:31,896
It really is simple.

835
00:57:32,642 --> 00:57:33,734
No more nonsense.

836
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:39,313
Ling, listen to my explanation.

837
00:57:39,883 --> 00:57:41,578
Explain in Court then.

838
00:57:42,085 --> 00:57:46,283
Ling.

839
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:52,092
- You've spoiled everything.
- We failed

840
00:57:52,195 --> 00:57:54,493
when I got caught in the house.

841
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:56,690
I told you once and again
it was only an accident.

842
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,596
Look, you can't trust him.

843
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:00,098
Piao.

844
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:03,263
You can't trust outsiders.

845
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:05,566
I know

846
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,505
this is a hard world.

847
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,002
I promised to get you off the hook.

848
00:58:10,179 --> 00:58:12,773
Nonsense.

849
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,213
You two are good for nothing.

850
00:58:14,317 --> 00:58:15,511
Well, have you finished?

851
00:58:16,352 --> 00:58:18,547
You're taking it out on me.
How about me?

852
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:20,118
Don't push me so hard, will you?

853
00:58:20,189 --> 00:58:21,178
I'm always so hard.

854
00:58:25,695 --> 00:58:27,390
Big Nose, are you using force?

855
00:58:27,564 --> 00:58:28,656
Why not?

856
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,925
I can hit you any time.

857
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:03,126
I've already called the police.

858
00:59:21,451 --> 00:59:25,353
I moved Heaven and Earth to stop...

859
00:59:25,421 --> 00:59:27,719
the Commissioner from suing you.

860
00:59:27,991 --> 00:59:30,983
You're all not young. Why fight?

861
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,321
Excuse me.

862
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:42,363
Why did you fight? For women?

863
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,698
The thin man for two girls

864
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:48,640
The fatty for one.

865
00:59:48,745 --> 00:59:50,440
I did it for two men.

866
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:00,583
How are you going to return...

867
01:00:00,857 --> 01:00:02,654
my favor?

868
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,194
What's wrong?

869
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:15,331
I'm disappointed in love.

870
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:19,240
If I were her, you wouldn't.

871
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:29,144
Bad, we lost a lot of fish.

872
01:00:29,652 --> 01:00:32,143
The factory, it's making narcotics.

873
01:00:39,662 --> 01:00:41,357
I'm sure you'll get off.

874
01:00:41,531 --> 01:00:43,123
I'm sure you'll press the brakes.

875
01:00:47,503 --> 01:00:49,300
What do you want?
A good dog won't stand in the way.

876
01:00:49,405 --> 01:00:50,804
- I am not a good dog.
- You're not a good man either.

877
01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:51,871
I'm a good man.

878
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:53,235
A good man never steals one's heart.

879
01:00:53,342 --> 01:00:54,536
I'm true to you.

880
01:00:54,644 --> 01:00:55,941
Really.

881
01:00:56,045 --> 01:00:56,943
You said it.

882
01:00:57,013 --> 01:00:58,105
Can't you feel it yourself?

883
01:00:58,247 --> 01:01:00,442
No, I have no feeling for you at all.

884
01:01:03,152 --> 01:01:04,449
You waste my time and fool me.

885
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:05,383
You're dirty.

886
01:01:05,488 --> 01:01:07,683
You double-crossed me and
yourselffor the commission.

887
01:01:16,065 --> 01:01:16,963
Why didn't you keep away for me?

888
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,499
If I did, I wouldn't have come here.

889
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:25,606
Why take such chances?

890
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:27,002
He's as good as dead.

891
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,408
I mean, if he got a spanner

892
01:01:29,545 --> 01:01:31,240
he'd kill you and me too.

893
01:01:31,314 --> 01:01:34,112
I'm not that bad.
Please listen to my explanation.

894
01:01:34,183 --> 01:01:35,172
At first I did

895
01:01:35,284 --> 01:01:36,876
want to use you

896
01:01:37,253 --> 01:01:40,245
but as we got on,
I fell in love with you.

897
01:01:40,389 --> 01:01:42,687
So you want to be the fishpond boss.

898
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:44,191
At first I had such an ambition.

899
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:46,727
To show my true love

900
01:01:46,896 --> 01:01:48,693
you may sell it for charity

901
01:01:48,865 --> 01:01:50,264
before marrying me.

902
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,699
On what are we

903
01:01:52,802 --> 01:01:53,894
going to live then?

904
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:56,801
Just take things as they come.

905
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,141
Sell it or not, we fare the same.

906
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:02,504
Dirty water keeps
pouring down from the factory.

907
01:02:03,246 --> 01:02:05,646
Let me go in to see what they're up to.

908
01:02:05,782 --> 01:02:06,976
Let's get in.

909
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:10,882
Get in, as she told you.

910
01:02:12,488 --> 01:02:13,682
Get in.

911
01:02:23,332 --> 01:02:24,629
A visitor for you.

912
01:02:35,178 --> 01:02:36,076
Ling.

913
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:39,671
Don't say anything now,
say it in Court.

914
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:43,078
Take care.

915
01:02:46,155 --> 01:02:48,350
I wanted to help you, but can't.

916
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:50,290
I've come to beg you

917
01:02:50,426 --> 01:02:52,326
to withdraw the suit.

918
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,554
No need. I've decided not to sue you.

919
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:56,688
I only hope you won't see me again.

920
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,595
No problem. I'll go now.

921
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:05,530
Why is it against me but not you?

922
01:03:05,675 --> 01:03:07,165
It's the spell of love.

923
01:03:10,513 --> 01:03:11,707
- Would you do something for me?
- Sure.

924
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:12,812
Free of charge.

925
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,007
I never charge for any service.

926
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,039
Follow me.

927
01:03:36,372 --> 01:03:37,464
You don't have to be like that.

928
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,837
It pays to be cautious.

929
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:44,007
All right, we meet
here in twenty minutes.

930
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,177
This is to prove you worked.

931
01:04:33,629 --> 01:04:34,425
Come with me.

932
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:42,386
What kind of factory is this?

933
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:24,533
How are you?
Sorry for the inconvenience.

934
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,005
Bye-bye.

935
01:06:32,214 --> 01:06:33,306
How are you?

936
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:37,248
What's this?

937
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:38,478
Just some telescope.

938
01:06:38,654 --> 01:06:39,552
Robbing me!

939
01:06:39,722 --> 01:06:41,212
- Get him.
- Don't move.

940
01:06:41,724 --> 01:06:43,214
Don't you dare to beat me up!

941
01:06:43,826 --> 01:06:46,226
How did you get in?

942
01:06:46,729 --> 01:06:47,525
How are you?

943
01:07:06,082 --> 01:07:07,276
Don't move.

944
01:07:10,286 --> 01:07:11,685
Detain him.

945
01:07:12,588 --> 01:07:15,489
OK, so I must risk my life.

946
01:07:29,939 --> 01:07:30,928
Here we go.

947
01:08:16,318 --> 01:08:18,616
OK boys. He can't move now.

948
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:24,157
Tie him up.

949
01:08:25,528 --> 01:08:28,429
District Court Civil Case No. 2346.

950
01:08:28,497 --> 01:08:30,294
The Yeh Fishpond's
applying for an injunction

951
01:08:30,432 --> 01:08:32,730
against Hua Chemical Works
from continuing production.

952
01:08:32,835 --> 01:08:38,330
Hearing now begins Mr. Lo presiding.

953
01:08:47,016 --> 01:08:49,211
Don't tie me up.

954
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:12,396
If he wakes up,
give him another injection.

955
01:09:22,484 --> 01:09:23,781
Dirty Fatso.

956
01:09:25,921 --> 01:09:28,219
As I'm a relative of the plaintiff.

957
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:31,584
I entrusted all specimen tests to...

958
01:09:31,727 --> 01:09:33,126
the Hong Kong University

959
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:36,323
Oceanography research personnel.

960
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:38,294
Their result shows

961
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,699
the lead content is 2% higher

962
01:09:41,804 --> 01:09:44,295
and oxygen 3% lower than mine.

963
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:00,718
Thank you, Miss Wen.

964
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:03,147
Your Honor, no more questions.

965
01:10:17,072 --> 01:10:20,064
This is a civil case,
the statements given...

966
01:10:20,442 --> 01:10:23,036
by the witnesses are professional ones.

967
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:27,912
So don't use the
usual criminal tactics.

968
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,447
Yes, Your Honor.

969
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,422
Miss Wen Mei-ling

970
01:10:43,499 --> 01:10:46,900
remember your vow about
speaking nothing but the truth...

971
01:10:46,969 --> 01:10:50,564
before giving your statements.

972
01:10:50,673 --> 01:10:51,867
I do.

973
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,431
Please answer the following question

974
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:56,443
in sincerity.

975
01:10:59,515 --> 01:11:00,812
Do you love me or not?

976
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:04,916
Why is he asking such a question?

977
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:08,452
Objected to as impertinent.

978
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:09,956
Objection overruled.

979
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,058
Let me decide whether
it's sustained or not.

980
01:11:16,465 --> 01:11:18,558
Please explain

981
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:20,031
why you ask such a question.

982
01:11:20,102 --> 01:11:22,798
Sorry, Your Honor.

983
01:11:22,971 --> 01:11:26,065
I have ample reason
to ask such a question.

984
01:11:26,275 --> 01:11:29,369
After she answers it, I'll explain.

985
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,380
Miss Wen, do you love him or not?

986
01:11:34,616 --> 01:11:35,810
Your Honor

987
01:11:35,884 --> 01:11:37,784
let's switch back to the water problem.

988
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,115
I testify in my capacity
as an Oceanography expert.

989
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:42,680
I know you're an expert

990
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:45,222
You're an expert

991
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:46,817
but you're a female too.

992
01:11:47,062 --> 01:11:47,858
The Court may object

993
01:11:47,996 --> 01:11:50,988
to a man asking another man
if he loves him or not

994
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,230
for that's abnormal.

995
01:11:53,902 --> 01:11:55,301
Now it's perfectly
normal for a man to...

996
01:11:55,504 --> 01:11:57,904
ask a woman if she loves him or not.

997
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,532
I find no reason to object

998
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:06,244
to his asking you this question.

999
01:12:06,715 --> 01:12:09,013
So you must answer it.

1000
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:12,019
Your Honor, I don't want
to talk about love in Court.

1001
01:12:12,855 --> 01:12:17,349
You must, the Court insists.

1002
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,357
Do you love me or not?

1003
01:12:21,497 --> 01:12:23,192
You must answer it.

1004
01:12:27,236 --> 01:12:28,430
No.

1005
01:12:32,007 --> 01:12:35,101
A false statement is perjury
in contempt of Court.

1006
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:36,902
You know?

1007
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,876
He takes a threatening tone,
but it's a fact.

1008
01:12:41,049 --> 01:12:42,038
Sorry, Your Honor

1009
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:43,641
I may be a bit too strong in tone

1010
01:12:43,786 --> 01:12:45,686
but this question
is most important for me.

1011
01:12:45,888 --> 01:12:48,186
Young men should
take a serious view of love.

1012
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:52,591
Wen Mei-ling, answer it seriously.

1013
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:55,888
Do you love me or not?

1014
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:57,330
Why force me
to answer this question?

1015
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:59,990
An oath outside
the Court means nothing.

1016
01:13:00,302 --> 01:13:03,601
Inside the Court it is legally binding.

1017
01:13:03,839 --> 01:13:06,034
You're criminally liable.

1018
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:09,833
I must have your answer, for...

1019
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:13,375
it will affect my future performance

1020
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:16,211
and way of life.

1021
01:13:16,318 --> 01:13:18,912
A sentimental man is harder
to find than a gem.

1022
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:23,285
I'm the judge, I can declare
anyone guilty or not guilty

1023
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:25,656
but I've no right to declare
him a lover or not.

1024
01:13:25,961 --> 01:13:28,259
You're the judge.

1025
01:13:29,298 --> 01:13:31,095
We're waiting for your judgment.

1026
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,561
I love him.

1027
01:13:47,449 --> 01:13:50,145
Your Honor,
as we love each other and...

1028
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:53,015
she and I represent the plaintiff
and defendant respectively

1029
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:56,022
for the sake of justice
and interests of both parties

1030
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:58,649
one of us must
withdraw from the case.

1031
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:01,962
Your Honor, please
grant my withdrawal.

1032
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:08,493
Permission granted,
case remanded for further hearing.

1033
01:14:11,106 --> 01:14:12,198
Court

1034
01:14:16,712 --> 01:14:18,111
How did you do your job?

1035
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,372
Lousy men.

1036
01:14:34,997 --> 01:14:36,897
You didn't give me

1037
01:14:37,032 --> 01:14:38,522
a chance to speak.

1038
01:14:41,303 --> 01:14:42,395
Keep the change.

1039
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:47,037
Sorry

1040
01:14:47,175 --> 01:14:48,472
I didn't mean to be seen.

1041
01:14:48,644 --> 01:14:49,633
What's that?

1042
01:14:57,085 --> 01:14:57,983
Thank you.

1043
01:14:59,755 --> 01:15:00,653
What's that?

1044
01:15:00,756 --> 01:15:02,747
Nothing. Go now. I'll join you.

1045
01:15:02,858 --> 01:15:03,950
Let's go first.

1046
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:07,820
Get a taxi. I've something to do.

1047
01:15:31,553 --> 01:15:32,542
Boss.

1048
01:15:38,126 --> 01:15:39,218
Start on this side.

1049
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:40,760
He goes that way. I this way.

1050
01:15:40,963 --> 01:15:42,555
- You wait here.
- No.

1051
01:15:42,731 --> 01:15:44,528
- It could be dangerous inside.
- I'm not afraid.

1052
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:45,825
I can't take care of you.

1053
01:15:45,867 --> 01:15:47,266
But I can myself.

1054
01:15:47,636 --> 01:15:48,534
Is it clear?

1055
01:15:48,637 --> 01:15:49,535
Go now.

1056
01:15:57,379 --> 01:15:58,778
- Put it on.
- For what?

1057
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,144
You'll soon find out.

1058
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:12,489
Piao.

1059
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:17,188
- Be careful.
- You too.

1060
01:16:22,604 --> 01:16:24,401
- Be careful.
- I'll do exactly that.

1061
01:16:55,537 --> 01:16:57,835
Throw him into the sea.

1062
01:17:07,215 --> 01:17:08,910
- Don't move.
- We come to find someone.

1063
01:17:08,984 --> 01:17:10,076
What?

1064
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:11,884
We are here to find someone.

1065
01:17:13,822 --> 01:17:15,221
That someone's not here.

1066
01:17:15,724 --> 01:17:17,919
Nonsense. I come with him.

1067
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,153
And he has not left.

1068
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:21,489
Fortunate we have come.

1069
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,528
Shut up.

1070
01:17:22,798 --> 01:17:24,993
This is my place.

1071
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:26,159
- Get away.
- What?

1072
01:17:26,902 --> 01:17:29,302
We must not be rash. Go.

1073
01:17:35,577 --> 01:17:37,374
They refine narcotics.

1074
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:38,971
Get them.

1075
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,359
I said I couldn't take care of you.

1076
01:17:53,495 --> 01:17:54,894
I told you I didn't need it.

1077
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,611
I'll get you.

1078
01:18:59,494 --> 01:19:01,792
Wang Fei-hsiung, are you all right?

1079
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:03,455
Headache.

1080
01:21:20,969 --> 01:21:22,266
Rotten men.

1081
01:21:44,559 --> 01:21:48,051
Kill them and
half of the action is yours.

1082
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:50,629
Sure.

1083
01:23:14,215 --> 01:23:15,204
You bastard.

1084
01:24:37,499 --> 01:24:38,898
Are you all right?

1085
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:40,125
Make a phone call.

1086
01:24:40,969 --> 01:24:42,061
Call police.

1087
01:24:55,917 --> 01:24:59,614
Bitch, you ruined my plant.

1088
01:25:10,899 --> 01:25:12,890
Jackie.

1089
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,430
My hand hurts.

1090
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:22,834
I stop on it to hurt.

1091
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:32,916
You pricked me with poison needle.

1092
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,517
Goodbye.

1093
01:27:34,742 --> 01:27:35,936
Ling.

1094
01:27:39,514 --> 01:27:41,812
Does it hurt?

1095
01:27:41,883 --> 01:27:42,679
No.

1096
01:27:42,784 --> 01:27:44,684
- I told you not to come.
- But I care for you.

1097
01:27:44,986 --> 01:27:46,385
Don't do that anymore.

1098
01:27:46,487 --> 01:27:49,183
And you thought. I'm gabby bag.

1099
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:51,087
Wake up, kids.

1100
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,659
Why don't you tell me you're here

1101
01:27:53,795 --> 01:27:54,887
Tell me what happened.

1102
01:27:54,996 --> 01:27:56,486
- What happened then was...
- Darling.

1103
01:27:57,832 --> 01:27:59,026
Darling.

1104
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,732
Love at the expense of friends.
