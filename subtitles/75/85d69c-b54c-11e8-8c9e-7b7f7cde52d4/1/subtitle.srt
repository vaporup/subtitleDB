00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,595
(door creaks)

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,393
(chalk squeaks)

3
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,752
(woman whimpers)

4
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,554
Hey!

5
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,039
If you want any tickets,

6
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,637
you'll have to go round
to the front of...

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,268
Oh, well, I suppose it'll be alright.

8
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,396
What the hell am I doing around here?

9
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,313
- They walk in here and...
- (whistling)

10
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,472
- Ch-ch-ch-ch!
- (bird sings)

11
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,114
Let's see. I hope I got...

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,109
Three?

13
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,271
(old man mutters)

14
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,711
That'll be seven dollars...

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,992
...and 50 cents.

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,430
(cock crows)

17
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,834
Shh.

18
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,476
(door slams)

19
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,753
(old man mutters)

20
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,151
(rhythmic squeaking)

21
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,836
(rhythmic squeaking of wheel)

22
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,718
(rattling)

23
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,030
(rattling stops)

24
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,679
(drip)

25
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,549
(drip)

26
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,514
(dog whines)

27
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,876
(cracks knuckles)

28
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,318
(fly buzzes)

29
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,277
No.

30
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,397
(fly buzzes)

31
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,597
(exhales)

32
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,153
(cracks knuckles)

33
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,198
(creaking)

34
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,119
(dripping)

35
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,430
(fly buzzes)

36
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,116
(fly buzzes)

37
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,392
(buzzing stops)

38
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,120
(buzzing starts again)

39
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,679
(buzzing stops)

40
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,511
(buzzing starts again)

41
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,188
(train approaches)

42
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,548
(fly buzzes)

43
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,275
(train whistle)

44
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,268
(bell)

45
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,158
(door shuts)

46
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,229
(train whistle)

47
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,318
(train moves off)

48
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,868
(harmonica music)

49
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,398
Frank?

50
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,032
Frank sent us.

51
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,280
Did you bring a horse for me?

52
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,559
(laughs) Well, looks like we're...

53
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,070
Looks like we're shy of one horse.

54
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,231
(laughter)

55
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,917
You brought two too many.

56
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,796
(horse whinnies)

57
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,432
(rhythmic squeaking of wheel)

58
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,789
(gunshot)

59
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,396
(panting)

60
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,516
Hey, Pa!

61
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,557
Look!

62
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,675
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

63
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,398
Boo!

64
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,240
(makes gun noises)

65
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,992
Timmy.

66
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,078
(hums cheerfully)

67
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,231
Maureen, look.

68
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,919
Hmm.

69
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,511
(Maureen) Ah!

70
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,791
(crickets chirping)

71
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,353
What you doing there?

72
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,351
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

73
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,954
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

74
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,476
Patrick's already left
for the station, huh?

75
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,278
He's getting ready, Pa.

76
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,590
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

77
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,754
Ah.

78
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,992
Not bad, I'd say.

79
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,593
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

80
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,149
But these are
the same slices as usual.

81
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,599
Hmm.

82
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,556
Yeah, sure.

83
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,239
As usual.

84
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,031
Maureen.

85
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,759
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

86
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,276
You'll have beautiful new clothes

87
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,954
and you won't have to work no more.

88
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,429
We're going to get rich, Pa?

89
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,796
Who knows?

90
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,031
Patrick!

91
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,156
Wait a minute!

92
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,753
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean 'em.

93
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,269
The train'll come in and there
won't be no one to meet your mother.

94
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,158
Our mother died six years ago.

95
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,196
Go now, or you'll really be late.

96
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,192
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How will I recognise her?

97
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,351
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

98
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,152
She's young and er...
she's pretty and... she's a lady.

99
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,435
Er...

100
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,957
''For travelling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

101
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,151
and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met.''

102
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,438
I'm gonna get
some fresh water from the well.

103
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,393
? Oh, Danny boy

104
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,473
? The pipes, the pipes are calling

105
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,312
(hums)

106
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,552
? And down the mountain side

107
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,278
? The summer's gone

108
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,630
? And all the roses fall...

109
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,835
(wind blows)

110
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,871
(laughs to herself)

111
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,831
(gunshot)

112
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,672
(gasps)

113
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,237
Maureen!

114
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,234
(gunshots)

115
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,639
(gunshot)

116
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,870
(horse gallops away)

117
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,750
(gasps)

118
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,592
(gunshot)

119
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,713
What are we gonna do with this one,
Frank?

120
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,033
Now that you've called me by name...

121
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,872
(cocks gun)

122
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,156
(train whistle)

123
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,836
(bell)

124
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,276
(jaunty music)

125
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,357
- I saw some fine stock down south.
- That so?

126
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,832
And the prices are good.

127
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,315
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

128
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,471
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

129
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,358
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

130
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,710
Is that true?
The sawmill needs hands?

131
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,553
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

132
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,154
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

133
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,151
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

134
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,276
Ha! Ha!

135
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,512
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

136
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,830
I got a whole train to unload.

137
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,878
Alright,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

138
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,270
Come on! Come on!

139
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,114
What's the name
of the place you wanted to go?

140
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,554
Sweetwater.

141
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,628
Hmm?

142
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,358
Brett McBain's farm.

143
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,989
McBain? Yeah, sure.

144
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,355
That stubborn red-headed Irishman,

145
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,910
tilling sand for years
out in the middle of nowhere.

146
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,072
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him

147
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,915
could call that stinking piece
of desert Sweetwater.

148
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,310
Sweetwater! (laughs)

149
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,588
A little more to the right.

150
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,910
Higher. Higher.

151
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,469
Hold it there.

152
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,592
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

153
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,548
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

154
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,188
Slow down.
What's the matter with you?

155
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,794
(shouting)

156
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,598
Watch out down there!

157
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,876
- Slow down!
- (driver laughs)

158
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,351
(driver) Whoa!

159
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,230
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

160
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,516
Don't the train stop?

161
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,831
(mutters)

162
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,154
(banging)

163
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,148
(banging stops)

164
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,840
(banging starts again)

165
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,552
What can I do for you, ma'am?

166
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,280
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

167
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,797
Water? That word is poison
around these parts

168
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,030
ever since the days
of the great flood.

169
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,112
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

170
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,078
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

171
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,437
You sure can. Just happen
to have a full tub at the back.

172
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,479
You're lucky. Only three people
have used it this morning.

173
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,200
Used it one at a time
or all together?

174
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,035
I can tell
you're accustomed to fine living.

175
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,192
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

176
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,794
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

177
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,757
- You've been there?
- No.

178
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,309
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

179
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,596
- You know, she...
- (horse whinnies)

180
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,910
(horses approaching)

181
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,596
(whinnying)

182
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,433
(gunshots)

183
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,918
(man cries out)

184
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,638
(gunshots)

185
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,514
(gasping)

186
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,557
(gunshot / body falls)

187
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,553
Jug.

188
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,513
(harmonica music)

189
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,158
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

190
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,638
Do you know
how to blow music from that?

191
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,834
Pick it up.

192
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,151
(plays harmonica)

193
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,077
You!

194
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,190
(tuts) You don't know how to play.

195
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,079
(gun chamber grinds)

196
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,992
(cocks gun)

197
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,118
Try this one.

198
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,950
Take it.

199
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,351
Go on.

200
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,993
Here.

201
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,111
(cocks gun)

202
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,513
(horse whinnies)

203
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,717
(laughs to himself)

204
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,514
Bravo.

205
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,431
(horses' hooves)

206
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,272
(cocks gun)

207
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,797
Hmm.

208
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,917
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.

209
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,799
It's alright. You're right on time.

210
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,432
To bury my escort.

211
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,236
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

212
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,838
(exhales)

213
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,075
Hey.

214
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,039
The gun.

215
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,116
You interested in fashions,
Harmonica?

216
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,234
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

217
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,391
They were waiting for a train.

218
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,552
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

219
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,069
So?

220
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,078
Inside the men,
there were three bullets.

221
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,111
(laughs)

222
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,477
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

223
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,516
For two reasons.

224
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,148
One, nobody around these parts

225
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,517
got the guts to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

226
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,393
Two, Cheyenne's men,
don't get killed.

227
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,437
That surprise you?

228
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,272
Yeah.

229
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,350
Well, you know music.

230
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,479
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

231
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,398
All the way up to six, if I have to.

232
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,116
And maybe faster than you.

233
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,071
- (plays harmonica)
- (laughs)

234
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,958
Yeah, go on.

235
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,190
Play, Harmonica.

236
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,033
Play, so you can't bullshit.

237
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,953
Only, watch those false notes.

238
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,510
(harmonica squeaks)

239
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,319
Like so?

240
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,194
(continues playing)

241
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,239
Hmm.

242
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,915
This cousin of mine keeps writing me
to come down to New Orleans.

243
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,629
''Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money.''

244
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,473
I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

245
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,915
It's too full
of fast men and loose women.

246
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,514
Begging your pardon, ma'am. Ah, no.

247
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,592
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet simple country life.

248
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,872
(sighs)

249
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,632
He's Timmy.

250
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,630
(sobs) Yes.

251
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,756
Dear God.

252
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,957
On the day...

253
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,117
On the very day of your wedding.

254
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,191
Poor little miss.

255
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,037
Mrs.

256
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,878
Mrs McBain.

257
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,873
But we all... We thought...

258
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,159
I know.

259
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,233
It was to be a surprise today.

260
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,630
Brett McBain and I were married.

261
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,836
A month ago.

262
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,673
In New Orleans.

263
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,196
I am the resurrection and the life.

264
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,750
He who believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

265
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,993
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die. Amen.

266
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,789
(horse's hooves)

267
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,159
- Mr Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

268
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,635
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

269
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,589
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

270
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,671
Cheyenne's hand.

271
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,669
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs McBain.

272
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,195
We'll make 'em tell us
before we hang 'em.

273
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,472
Let's get moving.

274
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,993
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.

275
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,750
No, Sam.

276
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,230
You go back.

277
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,756
You don't want
to stay out here alone.

278
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,150
Huh. Why not?

279
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,038
This is my home.

280
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,991
(sighs)

281
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,950
- (gunshot)
- (cries out)

282
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,156
(groans)

283
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,597
(groans)

284
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,679
(groans)

285
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,599
(chokes)

286
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,790
- You know, Wobbles...
- (chokes)

287
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,428
...I'm kinda mad at you.

288
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,471
Frank wasn't there.

289
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,229
- Ow!
- He sent three friends.

290
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,914
I don't know nothing, I swear.

291
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,392
I only arranged the meeting
the way... the way you wanted it.

292
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,711
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

293
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,316
- I swear to you that I...
- Cos he was at the McBains'.

294
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,679
That's not true.
Cheyenne did that job.

295
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,479
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

296
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,599
That was always one
of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

297
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,877
(chokes) I don't know.

298
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,439
I swear.

299
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,718
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

300
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,189
I don't know nothing.

301
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,555
(chokes)

302
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,593
(harmonica)

303
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,477
Who's there?

304
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,313
(birds squawk)

305
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,790
(cock crows)

306
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,518
(cock crows)

307
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,071
(gasps)

308
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,879
Did you make coffee?

309
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,353
Make it.

310
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,831
Didn't sleep a wink.

311
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,152
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

312
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,111
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

313
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,511
If they're lucky, they'll be home
in three days. (laughs)

314
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,991
(winces)

315
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,399
(laughs)

316
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,356
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

317
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,516
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

318
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,871
Idiots.

319
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,712
What the hell?

320
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,678
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

321
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,869
Be like killing a priest.

322
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,315
A Catholic priest, that is.

323
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,231
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

324
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,634
See, I ain't
the mean bastard people make out.

325
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,069
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me...

326
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,231
(sighs)

327
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,356
...it fires me up.

328
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,829
And a fired-up Cheyenne...

329
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,789
...ain't a nice thing to see.

330
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,996
Especially for a lady.

331
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,273
But you're too smart to make him mad.

332
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,793
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

333
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,755
Yeah. Uh-huh.

334
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,839
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

335
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,117
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me...

336
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,438
...so they can hang this thing
around my neck...

337
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,551
...I don't like it none.

338
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,711
But I can understand it.

339
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,119
Hmm.

340
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,512
What I don't understand is why.

341
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,118
Neither do I.

342
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,876
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

343
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,316
Yeah. (laughs)

344
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,995
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

345
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,196
Round. Yellow.

346
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,751
You know the kind.

347
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,836
You rap 'em on a stone...

348
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,270
...and they go ''ding''.

349
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,509
Maybe.

350
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,070
But I didn't find them.

351
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,071
Hmm.

352
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,512
By the way,

353
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,356
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

354
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,000
He's somebody you'd remember.

355
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,508
Instead of talking, he plays.

356
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,033
And when he'd better play, he talks.

357
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,635
You know, when you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

358
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,273
Sure. You're an expert.

359
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,599
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

360
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,113
Of course I have.

361
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,917
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

362
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,550
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

363
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,392
And even call in your men.

364
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,154
Well, no woman ever died from that.

365
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,199
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

366
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,476
and I'll be exactly
what I was before.

367
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,030
With just another filthy memory.

368
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,909
(sighs)

369
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,310
You make good coffee, at least.

370
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,359
Not bad.

371
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,556
Congratulations.

372
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,554
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

373
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,598
I only told you to scare them.

374
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,593
People scare better
when they're dying.

375
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,469
And can you tell me
what good was your stupid massacre?

376
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,199
Now, a Mrs McBain has turned up.

377
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,597
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

378
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,036
Let's say
this is something I didn't plan on.

379
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,917
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

380
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,550
You know that.

381
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,554
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

382
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,757
and before my eyes rot,

383
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,153
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

384
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,595
I know where you got on board.

385
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,035
I was there, too, remember.

386
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,394
- To, erm...
- (rings bell)

387
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,870
...remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

388
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,308
Well, there were a few.

389
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,914
(train whistle)

390
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,593
But we travelled a long way,
just the same.

391
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,239
And fast.

392
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,075
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

393
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,509
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr Morton.

394
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,797
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

395
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,399
I watch that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

396
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,115
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain.

397
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,114
But you,
you just got a little more hasty.

398
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,195
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

399
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,669
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

400
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,239
A lot.

401
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,876
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

402
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,910
Now, you're keeping
in the background.

403
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,389
You'll end up giving orders.

404
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,396
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

405
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,879
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

406
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,554
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

407
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,153
Hmm?

408
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,196
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

409
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,628
It's almost like holding a gun.

410
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,873
Only much more powerful.

411
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,598
You see, staying with you, I...

412
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,878
...I'm beginning to think big, too.

413
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,159
This McBain business...

414
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,596
...has given me ideas.

415
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,149
I'm sorry for you, Frank.

416
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,436
You're doing your best.

417
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,675
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

418
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,555
(chuckles) Why?

419
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:13,078
Because... there are many things
you'll never understand.

420
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,229
This is one of them.

421
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,836
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

422
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,790
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

423
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,118
(train whistle)

424
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,472
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

425
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,712
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr Morton,

426
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,669
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

427
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,468
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

428
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,833
You wake up one morning and say,
''World, I know you.''

429
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,560
''From now on,
there are no more surprises.''

430
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,109
And then you happen to meet
a man like this,

431
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,998
who looked like a good man.

432
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,754
Clear eyes, strong hands.

433
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,717
And he wants to marry you.

434
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,916
Which doesn't happen often.

435
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,958
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

436
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,157
So you think,
''The hell with New Orleans.''

437
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,198
''Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.''

438
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,829
''I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.''

439
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,111
''Take care of a house. Do something.
What the hell? ''

440
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,472
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain.

441
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,350
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

442
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,631
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

443
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,233
(laughs) If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

444
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,960
Mrs McBain goes back to civilisation.

445
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,556
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

446
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,959
Hmm. (tuts)

447
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,799
(sighs)

448
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,791
You deserve better.

449
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,758
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

450
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,269
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

451
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,433
She was the biggest whore
in Alameida

452
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,512
and the finest woman that ever lived.

453
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,916
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month...

454
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,549
...he must have been a happy man.

455
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,511
Hey! Hey!

456
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,509
(harmonica)

457
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,271
What do you want?

458
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,789
Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed
four, it's easy to make it five.

459
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,349
This isn't the time to leave.

460
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,150
Give me some water.

461
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,116
From the well.

462
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,714
I like my water fresh.

463
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,830
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

464
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,673
A sound? Like what?

465
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,833
- (gun clicks)
- Like that.

466
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,911
- (horses' hooves)
- (gasps)

467
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,072
(horses whinny)

468
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,438
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

469
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,876
(bell)

470
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,593
Morning, Mrs McBain.

471
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,149
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

472
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,471
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

473
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,471
I remember very well.

474
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,393
Is there something I can do for you?

475
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,158
Yes.

476
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,475
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

477
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,438
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

478
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,034
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

479
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,272
I got my own worries, and all I want
is to be left in peace.

480
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,433
Tell Frank I want to negotiate
with him. Personally.

481
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,670
(bell)

482
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,429
(animated conversation)

483
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,151
(train whistle)

484
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,196
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

485
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,955
Whatever business you have with
Frank, keep it far away from here.

486
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,556
I know, but when I heard that woman
say she knew everything,

487
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,792
I thought I should come over here
and tell you about it.

488
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,871
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

489
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,270
Sure, but you know
I'm mighty careful.

490
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,476
No one could have followed me.

491
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,359
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

492
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,829
To listen unseen
and to watch unheard.

493
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,073
(Morton) You should learn
to live as if you didn't exist.

494
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,435
You've known me a long time, Frank.

495
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,431
You know you can trust me.

496
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,158
Wobbles.

497
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,272
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

498
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,799
The man
can't even trust his own pants.

499
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,152
(rings bell)

500
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,559
Let's get out of here.

501
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,270
(train whistle)

502
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,230
(train whistle)

503
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,952
The end of the line.

504
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,870
Yeah.

505
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,919
Get him on board.

506
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,837
Tie him up.

507
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,033
Wait, Frank.

508
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,599
I didn't...

509
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,159
So, nobody followed you?

510
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,955
No. You gotta believe me.

511
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,520
So, this is the way I can trust you.

512
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,319
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

513
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,595
- Get out.
- No. No. No, Frank.

514
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,873
- Get out.
- (screams)

515
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,234
(groans)

516
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,039
Shh!

517
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,316
Frank, wait! (screams)

518
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,872
I told you to keep quiet.

519
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,399
Did Logan and Jim
take care of the woman?

520
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,630
Someone took care of them.

521
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,109
We found them out at McBain's place.

522
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,113
Stone dead.
And the woman was gone.

523
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,795
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

524
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,189
First three, then two.

525
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,354
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

526
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,553
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

527
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,195
What do you want?

528
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,351
Who are you?

529
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,433
Dave Jenkins.

530
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,755
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

531
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,792
Calder Benson.

532
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,830
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

533
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,751
You ought to know better than anyone.

534
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,273
You killed him.

535
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:08,830
Who are you?

536
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,116
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

537
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,596
The woman.

538
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,754
We're only losing time.

539
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,511
Alright. This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

540
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,035
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

541
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,751
Keep him warm for me.

542
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,195
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

543
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,558
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

544
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,869
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

545
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,793
Keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

546
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,393
Sure, Frank.

547
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,312
(train whistle)

548
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,391
(snoring)

549
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,472
(taps glass)

550
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,953
(taps glass)

551
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,512
(taps glass)

552
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,955
- See anyone?
- No.

553
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,192
There he is.

554
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,110
(toilet flushes)

555
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,031
(footsteps on roof)

556
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,476
(cocks gun)

557
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,354
(gun cocked)

558
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,271
(screams)

559
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,039
(toilet flushes)

560
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,515
You only know how to shoot?

561
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,511
Or do you know how to cut, too?

562
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,995
Hey, you.

563
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,478
Wait a minute.

564
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:50,232
Let's have a good look at you.

565
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,118
Hey. Mr Choo-Choo.

566
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,390
Hmm. (laughs)

567
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,150
It's easy to find you. Bastard.

568
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,470
I don't have to kill you now.

569
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,870
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

570
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,919
Two beautiful shiny rails.

571
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,033
There's another bastard.

572
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,029
And he's getting further away
every minute.

573
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,231
(rings bell)

574
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,998
There it is.
What your husband ordered from me.

575
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,039
And seeing as how he paid cash,
it all belongs to you.

576
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,272
Oak planks, beech, pine.

577
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,351
All first-grade lumber.

578
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,034
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

579
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:09,079
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

580
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,515
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

581
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,477
Enlarge the farmhouse?

582
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,677
He could have built
at least eight of them.

583
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,592
By the way, ma'am,

584
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,116
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

585
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,671
Only it seems he forgot to tell
me what he wanted printed on it.

586
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,999
Station.

587
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,115
How's that again?

588
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,748
I said print ''station''.

589
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,311
Looking for this?

590
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,313
I've had enough
of your butcher tactics.

591
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,710
I know that woman is here.

592
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,519
I don't want
any more useless killing.

593
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,638
I'm ready to make a deal
for that land.

594
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,791
To pay what's necessary.

595
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,235
I don't want to waste any more time.

596
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,316
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

597
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,073
When you're not on that train, you
look like a turtle out of its shell.

598
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,518
Just funny.

599
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:45,673
Poor cripple talking big
so nobody'll know how scared you are.

600
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,558
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

601
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,909
I don't have time
to compete with you.

602
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,112
Compete?

603
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:08,360
Why, you... You can't even
stand on your own feet by yourself.

604
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,114
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

605
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:25,032
I could squash you
like a wormy apple.

606
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,672
Sure, but you won't do it.

607
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,557
Because it's not to your advantage.

608
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,117
Hmm.

609
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,593
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

610
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,790
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

611
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,919
Oh, Morton.
Don't worry about the land.

612
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,389
If you feel like paying for it,
you can pay.

613
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,075
It won't make any difference to you,
dealing with the new owner.

614
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,393
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

615
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,597
There's a square staked out here.
It says ''water tank''.

616
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,719
Over here, too.
Only, it says ''post office''.

617
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,757
And this one says ''corral''.

618
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,115
And this here ''church''.

619
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,109
What the hell is this?

620
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,508
Can't you see?

621
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,034
It's a station.

622
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,679
And all around it, a town.

623
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,110
Brett McBain's town.

624
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,836
(laughs) Was he crazy!

625
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,195
Yeah, in a very special way.

626
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,116
An Irishman.

627
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:17,956
He knew that railroad coming through
Flagstone would continue on west.

628
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,759
So he looked over
all this country out here

629
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,354
until he found this hunk of desert.

630
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,157
Nobody wanted it.

631
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,229
But he bought it.

632
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:38,158
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

633
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,551
Waited for what?

634
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,554
For the railroad to reach this point.

635
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:50,874
But how could he be sure the railroad
would pass through his property?

636
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,193
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

637
01:35:55,360 --> 01:36:00,434
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

638
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,669
Under this land.

639
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,913
A-ha! He was no fool,
our dead friend, huh? (laughs)

640
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,358
He was going to sell this piece
of desert for its weight in gold.

641
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,833
You don't sell
the dream of a lifetime.

642
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,795
Brett McBain wanted his station.

643
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,310
He got the rights to build it.

644
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,318
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

645
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,392
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

646
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,828
One thing, though.

647
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,232
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

648
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,075
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

649
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,391
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point...

650
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,636
...the station ain't built yet.

651
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,952
A-ha.

652
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:58,273
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

653
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,672
Hey.

654
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,355
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

655
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:10,116
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

656
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,474
Yeah.

657
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,914
Yeah.

658
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,513
Listen.

659
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,599
Harmonica.

660
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,632
A town built around the railroad.

661
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,199
Hm-hm-hm!

662
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,510
You could make a fortune, huh?

663
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,233
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

664
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,311
Hey, more than that.

665
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,835
Thousands of thousands.

666
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,955
They call them millions.

667
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,469
Millions? Hmm.

668
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,630
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

669
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,396
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

670
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,915
All you gotta do is...

671
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,151
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?

672
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,751
Chief, what are we supposed to do?

673
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,990
What are you supposed to do?

674
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,515
Build a station, idiots!

675
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,589
I figure
it ain't gonna look like much.

676
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,232
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

677
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,156
If she gets back.

678
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,148
(nervous breaths)

679
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,273
(gasps)

680
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,072
I think...

681
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,513
Yeah.

682
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,314
I'm beginning to think I might be
a little sorry killing you.

683
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,913
You like being alive.

684
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,319
Hmm?

685
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,711
You also like
to feel a man's hands all over you.

686
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,511
You like it.

687
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,590
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

688
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,116
What a...

689
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,796
What a little tramp.

690
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,557
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

691
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,030
Nothing, Frank.

692
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,193
Hmm.

693
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,158
Now I understand
why they miss you so much...

694
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,155
...down there in New Orleans.

695
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,195
Great invention, the telegraph.

696
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,518
(mimics telegraph)

697
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,319
''Jill? The brunette? ''

698
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,953
''The customers of the most elegant
whorehouse on Bourbon Street

699
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:53,078
have been weeping
ever since she left.''

700
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,351
Say, tell me.

701
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,316
Did old McBain know?

702
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,951
Yeah.

703
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,315
Yeah, I bet he did.

704
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:08,392
He was just the type
to marry a whore.

705
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,793
Hey.

706
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,910
It's an idea.

707
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,711
I could marry you.

708
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,075
And the land would become mine.

709
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,637
And maybe...

710
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,109
...you'd make a perfect wife.

711
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:37,156
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

712
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,598
Too bad.

713
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:44,070
We'll have to think
of another solution.

714
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,753
Simpler.

715
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,391
Quicker.

716
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,353
(knocking)

717
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,875
As sheriff of this county,

718
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,157
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

719
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:22,598
of all property belonging to
Mrs Jill McBain, here present.

720
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,477
This parcel of land
measures 320 acres.

721
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:30,713
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

722
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,631
This property and all it contains,

723
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,995
lock, stock and barrel,

724
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:39,470
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

725
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:42,108
All the contents therein
are listed by number

726
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:45,078
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

727
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,949
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

728
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,918
Alright. That's clear to everybody.

729
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,798
I declare the auction open.

730
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,633
Now, who's going to make
the first bid?

731
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:05,153
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.

732
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,596
Alright. Now,
who's going to make the first bid?

733
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,836
$200.

734
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,355
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

735
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,192
$200. Do I hear more?

736
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:26,273
(whispers) That stinking piece
of land ain't worth it.

737
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:29,273
Come on, my friends, $200.

738
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,398
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

739
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,478
Well...

740
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,550
Who's going to bid $300?

741
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,236
Now, look, friends, I realise
we're not offering California here,

742
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:50,472
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

743
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:54,519
Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't
even take 200 as a deposit.

744
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,831
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

745
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,556
(murmuring)

746
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,278
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

747
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,796
I wish I were wrong, Mrs McBain,

748
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,953
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

749
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,511
All I want is to sell.

750
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,077
(man laughs)

751
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:35,471
- You look fat, huh?
- If you say so.

752
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,232
- How many?
- One card.

753
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,510
One for me.

754
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,717
Dealer takes three.

755
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,072
Can I... Can I take a hand?

756
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:05,553
15.

757
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,790
(laughs)

758
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,428
Yeah, sit down.

759
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,992
I'll deal.

760
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,758
Hmm?

761
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,514
How do you...

762
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,399
How do you play this game,
Mr Morton?

763
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:34,756
It's very simple.

764
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:40,310
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

765
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,633
$500.

766
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,679
Hmm.

767
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,910
$500.

768
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,196
Do I hear any other bids?

769
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,555
I don't think so.

770
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,468
I'm sorry, Mrs McBain,

771
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:12,316
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

772
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:25,429
$500 once.

773
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,360
$500 twice.

774
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,831
- $500...
- $5,000.

775
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,070
(excited murmurs)

776
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:02,668
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

777
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:17,273
(crowd) It's Cheyenne!

778
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,671
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that's right?

779
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:33,311
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

780
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,835
There were no dollars in them days.

781
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,149
But sons of bitches, yeah.

782
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:53,795
(train whistle)

783
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:56,110
Hey, wait a minute.

784
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,832
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

785
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,356
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

786
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,640
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

787
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,677
They got a modern jail there.

788
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,436
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

789
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,388
Oh, you'll like it, in 20 years.
You'll see.

790
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:59,633
(bell)

791
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:14,673
(counts)

792
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:20,711
Two tickets, amigo,
to the next station.

793
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,871
One way only.

794
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:23,836
Hm-hmm.

795
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,558
Here's to you. And congratulations.

796
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,316
You got yourself a good deal.

797
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,954
Oh, the auction.

798
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:41,237
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

799
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:47,711
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenceless widows.

800
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,551
But then again...

801
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,711
...I don't look
like a poor defenceless widow.

802
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,798
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

803
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:10,035
And you're a remarkable man.

804
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,714
But you have something on your mind.

805
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,639
Have you got something
on your mind?

806
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:27,795
Hot water.
A bathtub full of hot water.

807
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:48,439
I think it's time
I filled that bathtub.

808
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,517
Who are you?

809
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:42,270
Jim Cooper.

810
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,032
Chuck Youngblood.

811
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,678
More dead men.

812
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,713
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

813
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:02,310
You paid $5,000
for something that belongs to me.

814
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,110
5,000...

815
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,190
...plus one.

816
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,676
(coin falls on table)

817
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,150
You've got a right
to make a profit, too.

818
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,991
I wouldn't take too long
thinking about it, if I were you.

819
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,033
You got yourself
into something bigger than you.

820
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,919
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

821
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:04,117
You sound like a real businessman,
Frank.

822
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:07,272
Being with Mr Morton's
done you a lot of good.

823
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,794
And you've learned
some new methods.

824
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,679
Yeah, Mr Morton
has shown you a lot of new ways.

825
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,748
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

826
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,112
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

827
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,033
Which deal, Frank?

828
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,790
We have more than one, you and me.

829
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:50,680
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

830
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,956
Here and now.

831
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:54,872
(tuts)

832
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,632
Easy, Frank.

833
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:58,673
Easy.

834
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:01,430
You gotta learn not to push things.

835
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,592
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

836
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,230
I got an idea
Mr Morton can teach you a lot more.

837
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,272
How much?

838
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,989
One dollar.

839
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,353
Giddy up!

840
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:40,996
(gasps)

841
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:00,674
(horses' hooves)

842
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,154
Giddy up!

843
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,393
(horse whinnies)

844
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,358
I'd swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

845
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,350
Right now.

846
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,428
(groans)

847
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,035
(women scream)

848
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,753
(gun cocked)

849
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:29,269
(horse snorts)

850
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:37,788
(cocks gun)

851
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,591
Time sure flies.

852
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,195
It's already past 12.

853
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:52,795
But... But they were his men.

854
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,190
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

855
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,476
They found somebody
who pays better.

856
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:01,155
And you! You saved his life.

857
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:06,113
I didn't let them kill him.
That's not the same thing.

858
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:20,596
Sure.

859
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,990
It's not the same thing.

860
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,478
You get dressed.

861
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:32,789
It's time to go home.

862
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:46,270
(panting)

863
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,998
(whimpers)

864
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:35,279
(groans)

865
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,279
(waves crashing)

866
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:28,271
(shouts orders)

867
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:32,469
(gasps)

868
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,233
Did you make coffee?

869
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,836
This time I did.

870
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,996
Good.

871
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:29,752
My mother
used to make coffee this way.

872
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:34,997
Hot, strong and good.

873
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:44,031
(pours water)

874
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:45,792
- Cheyenne.
- Huh?

875
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:50,110
What's he waiting for out there?

876
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:53,630
What's he doing?

877
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,636
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

878
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:07,112
I got a feeling
when he stops whittling...

879
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,356
...something's gonna happen.

880
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:17,798
Surprised to see me here?

881
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,711
I knew you'd come.

882
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:47,078
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

883
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:50,556
Now I understand why.

884
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:56,433
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

885
02:13:57,680 --> 02:14:01,309
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

886
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:03,471
Just a man.

887
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:06,956
An ancient race.

888
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:17,156
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

889
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:19,311
The future don't matter to us.

890
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:20,959
Nothing matters now.

891
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:24,271
Not the land,
not the money, not the woman.

892
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:26,831
I came here to see you.

893
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:32,038
Cos I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

894
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:49,313
Only at the point of dying.

895
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,111
I know.

896
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:39,476
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

897
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,431
Put it there, please.

898
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:48,516
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

899
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:52,398
(sighs)

900
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:55,754
You know what?

901
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:01,234
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

902
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,239
You can't imagine

903
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:15,949
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

904
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:19,870
Just to look at her.

905
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:26,475
And if one of them
should pat your behind...

906
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:30,554
...just make believe it's nothing.

907
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:35,196
They earned it.

908
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:00,070
Keep your loving brother happy.

909
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:30,590
(inaudible)

910
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,709
(bell tolls)

911
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:13,077
Who... Who are you?

912
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:21,869
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

913
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,877
But I'm not the right man.

914
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:41,072
And neither is he.

915
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:45,517
Maybe not.

916
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,636
But it doesn't matter.

917
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,759
You don't understand, Jill.

918
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:57,119
People like that
have something inside.

919
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:01,790
Something to do with death.

920
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:09,519
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

921
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:12,638
pick up his gear and say adiós.

922
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:20,952
It would be nice
to see this town grow.

923
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:27,757
(slow footsteps)

924
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:51,353
(door shuts)

925
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:50,675
Now I gotta go.

926
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:37,317
Gonna be a beautiful town,
Sweetwater.

927
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:44,315
I hope you'll come back someday.

928
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:03,118
Someday.

929
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:17,910
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

930
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,036
Make believe it's nothing.

931
02:30:58,360 --> 02:30:59,873
(groans)

932
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,718
(groans)

933
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:47,431
Sorry, Harmonica.

934
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:49,431
I gotta stay here.

935
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:27,513
Who?

936
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:33,154
I ran into Mr Choo-Choo.

937
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:37,237
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

938
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:39,917
He got scared.

939
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:41,354
(groans)

940
02:32:57,520 --> 02:32:59,351
Hey, Harmonica.

941
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:02,231
When they do you in,

942
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:05,153
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

943
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:19,271
(winces)

944
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:21,309
Go away.

945
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:25,989
(winces) Go away.

946
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,993
Go away.
I don't want you to see me die.

947
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:03,557
(body hits the ground)

948
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:20,517
(train whistle)
