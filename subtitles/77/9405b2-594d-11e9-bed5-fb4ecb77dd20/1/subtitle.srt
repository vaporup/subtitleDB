1
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,819
Who is it?

2
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,030
It's Lieutenant Finley.
He's coming up the path.

3
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,741
It might be worth
listening to him, Edna.

4
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:20,122
So he can tell me about D-Day?
I don't wanna hear about D-Day.

5
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,041
Look what happened to my son

6
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,420
Hold it, Peggy.
Cut from D-Day to...

7
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,047
..." Don't tell me about
the black market."

8
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,008
You're making me a bitch...

9
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,051
...to keep in your propaganda!

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,636
Peggy, I'll tell you...

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,681
Oh, Jesus!

12
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,144
Oh, Bill. Katie wants to keep in
the black market. Bill!

13
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,146
Glad you're back.
How did it go?

14
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,025
Goddamn Pentagon, all they see
is red! Where's my coffee?

15
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,776
Get you some in a minute.

16
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,862
Don't cast that broad again.

17
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,573
Takes a reactionary to play one.

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,910
Where's my coffee?
Can't the chintzy OWI afford a gofer?

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,578
And where's Roxanne?

20
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,123
She called and she said that
she couldn't make it.

21
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,461
We'd like to get set up and go
from the top again, Mr. Verso.

22
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,922
- What's the matter?
- What is this?

23
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,090
Two lines I wrote.
No good, huh?

24
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,385
Morosky, let me do the writing,
will you?

25
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,556
Christ, I'm tired of being
a patriot for no money.

26
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,977
- She can't come?
- Nope.

27
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,063
Okay, Katie, you're in luck.

28
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,817
I'm taking you to El Morocco, courtesy
of the Office of War Information.

29
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,531
All right, Americans,
let's take it from the top.

30
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,534
One, two. One, two, three.

31
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,737
Clear the way.

32
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,156
Please clear the way.

33
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,242
Sir, we have a reservation.

34
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,120
- There are no more tables.
- But we called...

35
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,497
...and you said...
- Sorry, no tables.

36
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,291
- I told you...
- But we called...

37
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,545
I'd like to know your name
and also why you're not in uniform.

38
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,756
These boys have been in combat,
you fascist rope-holder.

39
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,052
- Hi, Fred. Bill Verso. OWI.
- Don't tip him.

40
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,973
- Get his name!
- We were with a whole bunch of people.

41
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,227
- Hey, Verso! Merry old Bill Verso.
- Hey, Tiny!

42
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,897
Stop it!
Don't do that!

43
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:50,981
They're with us.

44
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,357
Come on!

45
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,404
Thanks, Tiny.
Good to see you.

46
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,282
Listen, Katie...
Hey, Jimbo!

47
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,286
Can't you leave your
soapbox at home just once?

48
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,329
Coming through.

49
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,960
What do you want to drink?
I know. Dubonnet over ice.

50
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,130
Dubonnet over ice
and a scotch, straight up.

51
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,402
Here's your Dubonnet, Morosky.

52
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,409
Oh, to be in uniform!

53
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,540
Hubbell Gardiner.

54
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,666
What?

55
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,126
That's his name.

56
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,128
Swell. What's hers?

57
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,423
I suppose they learn that
balance on board ship.

58
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,759
Absolutely. Let's dance.

59
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,469
What've you got to lose?

60
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,931
I'll probably go overseas soon.
It's pretty hush-hush.

61
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,700
Save Loyalist Spain!
Stop Franco for world peace now!

62
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,619
Write President Roosevelt!

63
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,914
Come on. Do something about it!

64
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,250
Save Spain!
Stop Franco!

65
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,213
Stop the slaughter of innocent women
and children. Do something!

66
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,215
Write your congressman today.

67
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,300
Katie, what are you selling?

68
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,384
The ROTC.

69
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,637
You can have it cheap!

70
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,804
Fascist.

71
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,834
Row, Hubbell!

72
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,724
A true peace rally...

73
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:21,436
...should cover the entire spectrum
from extreme right...

74
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,439
...to extreme left.
As our next speaker proves.

75
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,611
The President of the Young Communist
League. She needs no introduction.

76
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,405
Miss Katie Morosky.

77
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,165
Guess I do need an introduction.

78
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,833
Back up, Katie.

79
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,252
Yeah, all the way to Moscow!

80
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,173
You can still take Communion
and like the Soviet Union!

81
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,926
What's cooking in the Kremlin, Katie?

82
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,930
The Kremlin's worried about the
civil war in Spain. Are you?

83
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:01,226
Thousands of Spanish citizens
are being bombed and murdered.

84
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,688
Only one country is sending help.
One country.

85
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,316
The Soviet Union.

86
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,487
K-K-K-Katie, be my C-C-C-Comrade.

87
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,239
O-K-K-K-Kay!

88
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,828
What are you scared of?

89
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,458
The Russians don't want anybody
in Spain but the Spanish.

90
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,293
Is that scary?

91
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:32,341
They're Communists, but they want
total disarmament. Is that scary?

92
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:38,222
Hitler and Mussolini are using Spain
as testing ground for what they want.

93
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,141
Another world war! Is that scary?

94
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,018
You're darn right it is!

95
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,355
There's only one thing
to be scared of...

96
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:50,776
...and it's not me, it's not the
Young Communist League...

97
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,612
...and it's not the Red bogeyman.

98
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,617
You be scared of anybody, anyplace...

99
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:03,330
...who will not stand up
for world peace now!

100
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,385
You're really...

101
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,720
...you're really something.

102
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,391
Really...
You're really beautiful.

103
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,020
No, I mean it.

104
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,273
You're really beautiful.

105
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,775
You're the best...

106
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,069
...the brightest...

107
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,656
...most committed generation
this country's ever had.

108
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,993
That's why you're here today,
striking for peace.

109
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,372
Why, they're striking on almost every
single campus in this country.

110
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,877
They're taking that pledge. Show your
solidarity by taking it with them.

111
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,005
"I refuse to support"...

112
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,965
Come on, come on.

113
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,342
"I refuse"...Come on.
On your feet!

114
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,263
"I refuse to"...That's right.
On your feet. Everybody.

115
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,640
"I refuse to support"...

116
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,101
No, everybody. Everybody!

117
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,979
"I refuse to support...

118
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,815
...the government of
the United States...

119
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,652
...in any war it might conduct."

120
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,090
The student council calls
this a peace rally. I call it...

121
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,426
...a peace strike.

122
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,054
And I'm an English major.

123
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,517
It isn't that funny.

124
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,119
You fascists!

125
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,430
- We have to talk about this stuff.
- Wait a second.

126
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,018
- You've been on that for two months.
- Three.

127
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,436
It's a short story...

128
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,189
Frankie Mc Veigh,
you're not funny.

129
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,066
- I know it.
- Listen...

130
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:39,862
...would you do me a favour?
Take the YCL meeting Monday night.

131
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,364
- You can't miss a meeting.
- I have to.

132
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,868
The story is due on Tuesday
and it's just gotta be good.

133
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,792
Look who's here,
America the beautiful.

134
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:59,840
- How much do you have in the treasury?
- $542.18.

135
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,261
Possible themes for the prom.

136
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,514
"Caribbean Holiday," "Jungle Fever"...

137
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:10,100
Hey, you should be listening to this.

138
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,435
"Niagara Falls."

139
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,106
"Thirteen Colonies," "48 States."

140
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,234
"Thirteen Colonies," "48 States"...

141
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,360
J.J.

142
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,988
J.J., listen.

143
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:28,035
"The 48 States," "Starlight, Star
Bright" and " In My Merry Oldsmobile."

144
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,829
How about
"Bread Lines Can Be Fun"?

145
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,752
How about "The Stalin Shuffle"?

146
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,089
What are we gonna have?
Hamburgers?

147
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,761
How about "The College Grad
Meets The Leningrad"?

148
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,933
She's a million laughs.

149
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,102
- What do you want?
- Coke.

150
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,606
- Coca-Cola?
- Coca-Cola.

151
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,818
Excuse me.

152
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,279
You're all decadent
and disgusting.

153
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,243
Come on, we weren't
making fun of you.

154
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,788
You make fun of everything.
You think politics is a joke.

155
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,084
You make fun of politicians.

156
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,962
- What else can you do?
- Think Franco's funny?

157
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,465
- Franco? Is he here?
- Yeah, Franco. He's a politician.

158
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:28,262
He's funny? Hitler has a funny
moustache. Why not have a Nazi prom?

159
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,933
Well, we thought of that,
but the uniforms itch.

160
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,029
Comes the revolution, maybe
we'll have a sense of humour.

161
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,073
Four cheeseburgers, four cokes.

162
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,783
Onion?

163
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,618
Yeah, in the cokes.

164
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:03,190
If I read comparatively few of your
stories aloud in class...

165
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,402
...it's because I think we
learn best from what's good.

166
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,821
Or at least, talented.

167
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,909
Today I'm going to read,
with a great deal of pleasure...

168
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:18,997
...a remarkably good story
from a surprising new source.

169
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,419
The name of the story is
"The All-American Smile."

170
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,339
And it's by Hubbell Gardiner.

171
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,059
"In a way, he was like the country
he lived in.

172
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:43,939
Everything came too easily to him,
but at least he knew it.

173
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,110
About once a month he worried
that he was a fraud.

174
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,240
But then most everyone he knew
was more fraudulent.

175
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,992
Sometimes he felt...

176
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,576
- there's really no reason
for us to change.

177
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,705
But of course by then, they were
too lost or too lazy.

178
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,334
It had always been too easy."

179
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,560
The trouble with some people
is they work too hard.

180
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,939
Are you speaking to me?

181
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:50,983
Want a beer?

182
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,111
I don't drink.

183
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,613
One sip. One sip of beer.

184
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:07,749
Well?

185
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,421
- You carry your books all the time?
- That's what I crossed the street for?

186
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,881
I'm celebrating.

187
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,466
What are you celebrating?

188
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,969
I got you to cross the street.

189
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,311
Listen, I'm sorry I...

190
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,442
I haven't told you that
I really liked your story.

191
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,485
You're a good writer.

192
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:36,695
Thank you.

193
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,415
Mrs. Simpson married the Duke of
Windsor. It's in tomorrow's paper.

194
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,960
How do you know that?
The papers aren't out yet.

195
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:55,047
I work in the Linotype room
two nights a week.

196
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,508
You never quit, do you?

197
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:01,803
Well...

198
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,682
...thanks for getting me
across the street.

199
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,522
I sold one.

200
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,150
I sold a story.

201
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,906
I've never known anybody who sold one.

202
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:23,742
Oh, boy, Hubbell.

203
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,288
Okay, so have a drink.

204
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,551
Sit.

205
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,068
To your first novel.

206
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,780
- Wait a minute, not so fast.
- Why not?

207
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,534
Yeah, why not?

208
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,790
You should've laughed.

209
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,710
"Any peace but Katie's piece."

210
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,795
You were good. You had them.

211
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,882
You could've kept them,
if only you'd laughed.

212
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,594
- It wasn't funny.
- That's not the only reason to laugh.

213
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,596
- You're a puritan.
- I am not.

214
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,891
- You've no sense of humour.
- My family thinks I'm humorous.

215
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:33,187
- Why are you always angry?
- Not always! Because I don't know...

216
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:37,482
...about coed humour. I've never
been in a fraternity or sorority...

217
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:41,403
...which is where I'm sure they make up
all that dirty stuff anyway.

218
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,447
That's pretty dirty business.

219
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,783
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

220
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,119
Do you smile all the time?

221
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,455
No.

222
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,879
No. No.

223
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,550
Here's to commencement.

224
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,765
A funny word for "the end."

225
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,197
Mrs. Simpson married
the Duke of Windsor.

226
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,326
I told you that, didn't I?

227
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:30,828
Yeah, you did.

228
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,131
I'm really happy about your news.

229
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,762
I hope I get to read
your story someday.

230
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,055
Put your foot here.

231
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,121
Go get 'em, Katie.

232
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,332
See you, Hubbell.

233
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:19,668
See you.

234
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,320
Don't spill it on your dress.

235
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:55,287
I'd like to have the sewing concession
when they want to shorten those dresses.

236
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,998
You know, to get
some wear out of them.

237
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:40,249
<i>Grab your coat and get your hat</i>

238
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:44,086
<i>Leave your worries on the doorstep</i>

239
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,214
I'm glad we're not
working on commission.

240
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:52,636
I've never been to a dance before,
except the one the YCL gave for Spain.

241
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,020
Here, have a drink.

242
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,939
- Here.
- What's that, bourbon?

243
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,149
It's gin, Katie. Come on.

244
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,736
From the bottle? So bourgeois.

245
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,949
- Let's dance.
- We aren't supposed to.

246
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:17,661
You weren't supposed to buy me a
corsage either. Come on.

247
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,756
Can you, Frankie?

248
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,975
Frankie Mc Veigh, you've got
a foot for dancing!

249
00:28:58,864 --> 00:28:59,698
Hubbell?

250
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:02,451
Hubbell?

251
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:25,974
What do you know?

252
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,480
Small world, isn't it?

253
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,483
I fall asleep?

254
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,402
I think so.

255
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:40,614
What do you know?

256
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,492
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee?

257
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,080
Oh, yeah.

258
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,582
Coffee.

259
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,014
Here you are, kiddo.
Good night.

260
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:09,893
Good night.

261
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,356
Good night, Hubbell, old boy.

262
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,025
Whoever you are.

263
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,735
Who are you?

264
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,205
It's the top floor.

265
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,379
Only one more!

266
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,936
In there.

267
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,001
Hubbell?

268
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:43,505
Hubbell?

269
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,844
General quarters!
Count down!

270
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,220
Stand safe...

271
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:11,982
Hubbell.

272
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,071
Hubbell, it's Katie.

273
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:25,579
You didn't know it was Katie.

274
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:37,299
I'll be done in a minute.

275
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:41,011
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, it's okay. I like to iron.

276
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,139
Gee, you have a lot
of ribbons here.

277
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:45,766
You have any aspirin?

278
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:48,977
Oh, I don't.

279
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,605
Push in on your temples.

280
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:59,029
How can you not have aspirin?

281
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,240
I always eat for a headache.

282
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,377
Do you have my watch?
Do you know where it is?

283
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:16,296
I took it off and put it
on the bedpost.

284
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,564
I thought you'd be more comfortable...

285
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,858
- That's why I...
- Here.

286
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,109
Thank you.

287
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,076
It's your hair.

288
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,122
That's what's different.

289
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,333
I have it ironed.

290
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,503
You have your hair ironed?

291
00:38:58,755 --> 00:38:59,590
Does it hurt?

292
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,217
No.

293
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:10,184
Have some coffee at least.

294
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,936
I'm low on sugar,
but it's real coffee.

295
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,401
No, thank you. I have to
meet J.J. At the train.

296
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,111
Looks good, though.

297
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,113
You still have J.J.?

298
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:28,785
How long will you be around?
Where are you stationed?

299
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,120
In Washington.

300
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:33,373
Oh, that's good.
That could be exciting.

301
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:34,416
Why?

302
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,084
Roosevelt is there.

303
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:39,463
I thought the Party said he was
an evil warmonger.

304
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:41,965
How do you know that?

305
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:45,302
You still think a varsity letter
stands for "moron," huh?

306
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:51,099
Some people work out
better than we think.

307
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,147
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, listen...

308
00:39:57,356 --> 00:40:00,984
This is my number, and this is
the OWI office where I work.

309
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:05,572
This is the radio station. It's
very difficult to find a hotel room.

310
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:09,493
If you're ever in town and you
can't find one, well, just...

311
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,539
No obligation of course.

312
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:14,832
Thank you.

313
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,377
About last night...

314
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:22,297
I'm sorry. I've been
falling asleep all over lately.

315
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:24,591
That's okay.

316
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:28,470
Hope my snoring didn't
keep you awake.

317
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:31,348
Oh, that's okay.

318
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:33,267
I like snoring.

319
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:38,856
See you, Katie.

320
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,400
See you, Hubbell.

321
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:44,528
Good luck.

322
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:48,699
American-Soviet benefit,
Friday night at town hall!

323
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:52,035
Come to the American-Soviet
Friendship benefit Friday.

324
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,414
American-Soviet benefit
at town hall, folks.

325
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:58,917
Come to the American-Soviet
benefit Friday night.

326
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,087
Thank you. Big show.
Big show at town hall, folks.

327
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:05,382
Come to the American-Soviet
benefit Friday night.

328
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:08,302
Hey, soldier, why don't you
bring a date?

329
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,054
Come to the American-Soviet benefit.

330
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,306
Bring a date.

331
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:15,017
Come to the American-Soviet benefit.

332
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,562
American-Soviet...
Jesus, I'm late for the OWI.

333
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,189
See you later, Pony.

334
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:21,231
Bye!

335
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:25,068
- Vote for Thomas E. Dewey!
- We've gotta stop FDR.

336
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:28,947
I'll take them. I'll give them
to your friends. I'll help you.

337
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,620
CDHQ, America Calling.

338
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,873
Applications are available
at your local post office.

339
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,833
CDHQ, America Calling.

340
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,877
Can you identify them?

341
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:47,132
Over the Bronx?
25 Stuka Dive Bombers.

342
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:51,970
I've got it, madam. Yes, I remember
Pearl Harbor. I'll connect you.

343
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,556
Even if he lost the paper,
I'm still in the book.

344
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,725
It's only been a week.

345
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,603
One moment, please.
I'll connect you.

346
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,607
He could phone at least.
CDHQ, America Calling.

347
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:06,485
Phone where?
You've only got eleven jobs.

348
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,072
You've censored all
but nine minutes.

349
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,408
- It implied that we spit on Negroes.
- Which you do.

350
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:17,162
- The situation...
- Now the Negroes are a situation?

351
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,039
After the war, the Pentagon...

352
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,167
It'll be just like it was
before, you racist fink!

353
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,419
- What's with her this week?
- This week?

354
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,547
- What do you mean?
- Shut up!

355
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:29,675
- I have 21 minutes of dead airspace!
- It's his fault!

356
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:32,511
<i>Okay, okay! I'll sign.</i>

357
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,596
Hubbell?

358
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,974
<i>- Where are you?
- Grant's tomb.</i>

359
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,685
<i>I can't get a room.
Can I use your couch?</i>

360
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:42,521
- Of course you can.
- Morosky, we have...

361
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,273
Will you, please!

362
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:48,026
Hubbell, there's beer in the icebox
and clean towels...

363
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:50,070
...and if you wanna take a nap...

364
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,074
<i>... take off the phone and put it
in the drawer of the desk.</i>

365
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:57,369
<i>- How do I get the key?
- I'll call the super.</i>

366
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,024
Hubbell!

367
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:37,784
I wasn't sure when you'd be home.
How are you?

368
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,872
I'll be back later.
Could you leave a key...?

369
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:46,335
You can't. I got steaks and potatoes
and sour cream and chives...

370
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:48,295
...and salad and fresh pie.

371
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,422
I would have made pot roast...

372
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:55,010
...but I didn't know if you liked it.
Anyway, there wasn't time...

373
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,471
...so I got steaks with
my ration stamps.

374
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:01,642
And you must be hungry,
you couldn't have had time to eat.

375
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:06,522
You can't go yet. You've got to stay
for supper, that's all there is to it.

376
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:13,237
What kind of pie?

377
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:17,783
Oh, your hero, huh?

378
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:18,909
Who?

379
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,752
He wasn't in college when he
did nothing for Spain.

380
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:33,131
- Congress was isolationist in '37...
- You'd justify the Nazi-Soviet pact.

381
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,052
Easier than you can justify the
Allies sitting on their behinds...

382
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,346
Why can't you say asses?

383
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:43,976
- Because I can't.
- Why?

384
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,602
What happens?

385
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:47,729
I don't know. Nothing.

386
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,607
- What a subject for two...
- It's interesting.

387
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,943
You'd rather talk politics.

388
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:57,906
All the contradictions. Should we
get in the war, should we not?

389
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,534
Stalin's for Hitler.
Stalin's against him.

390
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:03,453
All political doubletalk,
but you hold on.

391
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:04,997
I don't know how you do it.

392
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,082
I don't know how you can't.

393
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,252
You're jealous.

394
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,921
- What?
- You are.

395
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:15,966
Why are you jealous?

396
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,760
I'll live.

397
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:21,054
Maybe longer.

398
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,808
But you won't write another novel.

399
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:48,582
You must've gotten one
of the two copies sold.

400
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:51,543
- You get through it?
- Oh, I managed.

401
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:52,961
Twice.

402
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,047
I liked it.

403
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,549
I liked it a lot.

404
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:01,887
What didn't you like?

405
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:06,767
The way you write is no problem.

406
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:10,103
Your style is absolutely gorgeous.
But...

407
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:11,146
Gorgeous?

408
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:13,148
It is.

409
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,318
It is gorgeous.

410
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,114
But you...

411
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:23,534
...stand back.

412
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:28,413
Do you know what I mean?

413
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:30,707
Go ahead.

414
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:35,295
You see, the people...

415
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:39,258
...you watch them...

416
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:41,760
...from a distance.

417
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:43,387
Where?

418
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:45,180
In the book.

419
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,182
I know, in the book.

420
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:48,892
Where in the book?

421
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,519
Be specific.

422
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:55,107
All through it, Hubbell.

423
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:02,781
But it's your first novel, and
I'm sure the second one will be...

424
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,783
Why should I write another novel?

425
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,662
Because you must!
You're too good a writer not to.

426
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:19,131
Are you really so sure
of everything you're so sure of?

427
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,215
Sure.

428
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,384
Aren't you?

429
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:23,802
No.

430
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:26,638
No. Not as sure.

431
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,810
Do things still come too easily?

432
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,025
"In a way he was like
the country he lived in.

433
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:40,360
Everything came too easily to him."

434
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,198
What made you remember that?

435
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:49,495
I always wondered if
it would stay true.

436
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:55,125
Not altogether.

437
00:47:57,628 --> 00:47:59,254
What doesn't come easy now?

438
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,134
Hotel rooms.

439
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:09,556
Be serious.

440
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:28,325
Do you know you're beautiful?

441
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:32,913
You are.

442
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:41,672
But you mustn't be too serious.

443
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:43,423
I won't be.

444
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:45,634
I won't be.

445
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,689
Happy Rosh Hashanah!

446
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:30,739
- What is it?
- What do you mean, what is it?

447
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,497
You get to see your old pal J.J.

448
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:42,668
It'll be fun. We can all be
decadent and eat eggs Benedict...

449
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:44,503
...and vote Republican.

450
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:47,422
- I don't like eggs Benedict.
- Really?

451
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:51,593
- I'll bet you were a cheerleader.
- Me?

452
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:53,720
- Come on.
- No!

453
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,431
Maybe you'll have a good time.

454
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,602
<i>Paper doll that I can call my own</i>

455
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:02,938
<i>A doll that other fellows...</i>

456
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:06,024
Boy, this is some Navy
you're in, J.J.

457
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:07,359
Hi, Hub.

458
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:11,321
You mean all this?
It belongs to my aunt.

459
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:14,158
Is that the one that
plays the accordion?

460
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,410
Does she really play the accordion?

461
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,829
- She got squeezed to death.
- She did not.

462
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:21,790
She's gone overseas.
She's with the USO.

463
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:23,959
Best USO?

464
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:26,044
- Come on.
- I got it.

465
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:27,421
Hollywood and Vine.

466
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:29,006
Best USO hostess?

467
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:30,424
Tallulah Bankhead.

468
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:32,551
I hope your aunt's under Patton.

469
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:35,053
You can bet she's under somebody.

470
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:37,639
Excuse me.

471
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:38,932
All right.

472
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:43,187
- Okay. How about... Gardiner?
- Wait a second.

473
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:46,899
- Best small hotel.
- Not fair. I haven't been abroad.

474
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:48,692
But it's in Switzerland.

475
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:52,821
We don't want to make any bad jokes.
Saint Regis in Paris.

476
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,573
Pretty, isn't it?

477
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:58,076
You look different.

478
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,579
It's my hair.
I have it ironed.

479
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,665
- You what?
- In Harlem.

480
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,752
I actually have friends
in Harlem.

481
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,880
I'm sure you do.
Would you like me to disapprove?

482
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:12,883
But how long has this been going on?

483
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:16,094
I mean, Hubbell Gardiner and
K-K-K-Katie Morosky.

484
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:19,806
- No. No, she looks terrific.
- I like her, J.J.

485
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:23,393
- You really haven't changed, have you?
- Neither have you.

486
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,230
As pretty as ever.

487
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:28,982
For a while.

488
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:31,819
I'm with J.J. Now.

489
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:34,196
Are you?

490
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,698
Excuse me.

491
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:41,537
Remember how she looked
in college compared to now?

492
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:44,456
- Can I get you a drink?
- I don't think so.

493
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:47,459
- What were you doing?
- She seemed upset.

494
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:55,467
You do it. You make yourself
feel out of place.

495
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:01,390
I feel like I'm here for drinks
and everyone else gets supper.

496
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,350
Try talking to them.

497
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:05,143
- I have.
- No you don't.

498
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,979
You don't talk, you lecture.

499
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:09,439
What was that speech about Yalta?

500
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,775
No one here needs you to explain it.

501
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,278
Then why all those silly jokes?

502
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,114
J.J. Called Roosevelt
the "Yaltese Falcon."

503
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,741
I thought it was pretty funny.

504
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:23,996
And selling your novel to Hollywood?
I hope that's meant to be funny.

505
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,706
- Why?
- Why?

506
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,667
Because you're too good
for Hollywood, that's why.

507
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,795
Maybe I'd be lucky to sell a
book to Hollywood.

508
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:34,089
You've never even been there!

509
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:38,677
Besides, this isn't the point.
Can't we just relax and enjoy the party?

510
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:43,307
You get onto politics, and your sense
of humour goes right out the window.

511
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:48,020
I guess there are just
some things that are...

512
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:51,523
...difficult for me
to laugh about, Hubbell.

513
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:55,903
<i>Than have a fickle-minded
Real live girl</i>

514
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:12,002
I'm sorry.

515
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:15,380
I got caught up at the studio and...

516
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:19,092
...then I met somebody from
the party who wondered...

517
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:20,594
What? What?

518
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,846
The first eight chapters.

519
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:29,478
You want to read it, read it.
But let's not discuss it.

520
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:30,771
All right.

521
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,610
If you don't like it, you have to say
you don't like it and why.

522
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:38,695
What if I like it?

523
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:40,656
Waiter?

524
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:02,719
Ahoy.

525
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:06,890
Come in.

526
00:55:18,694 --> 00:55:19,611
How you doing?

527
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:20,696
Fine.

528
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:30,205
Is that new?

529
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:31,999
It was in the other room.

530
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,461
Looks good there.

531
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,632
Plants are all growing.

532
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:47,514
How's your mother?

533
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,893
Much better, like the news.

534
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,400
I might be able sell
my book to Hollywood.

535
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,652
I know, J.J. Told me.

536
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:08,785
What do you think about that?

537
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:12,623
About living in sunshine
all year long...

538
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,919
...and going to work in a sports car?

539
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:19,213
Sailing.

540
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:21,715
Sounds wonderful.

541
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:39,650
Would you like a drink?

542
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:44,446
No.

543
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:50,494
No, I just stopped.
I was out walking.

544
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:55,916
Hey, thanks.

545
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:35,205
I love the way you write.

546

Subtitles by Thiagarajan.RM

547
00:57:42,388 --> 00:57:45,391
<i>Franklin Roosevelt is dead.</i>

548
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,936
<i>Most of you have already
heard the news.</i>

549
00:57:48,144 --> 00:57:51,689
<i>But it will take days,
perhaps weeks, even months...</i>

550
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,277
<i>... for the final tragedy of
what happened at 5:45 this morning...</i>

551
00:57:56,528 --> 00:57:58,738
<i>... to be fully comprehended.</i>

552
00:57:58,988 --> 00:58:02,909
<i>What seems particularly touching
is that he will not be here...</i>

553
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:05,787
<i>... to share in a victory
so close at hand.</i>

554
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:08,957
Did you go see it?

555
00:58:09,457 --> 00:58:11,251
I was talking to...

556
00:58:12,043 --> 00:58:13,920
There was this older guy...

557
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:17,340
...on, you know, that
steel platform between cars?

558
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:24,013
I helped him open
a big door, he needed air.

559
00:58:24,264 --> 00:58:27,517
Jesus, I can't even remember
when he wasn't President.

560
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:32,522
A fourth term was too much
for the old man.

561
00:58:33,148 --> 00:58:34,983
A third was too much
for my old man.

562
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:38,403
- At least it'll end those Eleanor jokes.
- Some were funny.

563
00:58:38,862 --> 00:58:41,990
How about Eleanor in the mine
with the hillbillies?

564
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:45,201
Her face was covered
with grime, right?

565
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:48,830
Grime? For chrissakes, Judianne,
Eleanor went down into...

566
00:58:49,038 --> 00:58:53,084
...a mine and got her face black with
coal. The hillbillies saw her...

567
00:58:53,293 --> 00:58:54,794
...big buckteeth shining...

568
00:58:55,003 --> 00:58:56,671
Her husband is dead!

569
00:58:58,381 --> 00:58:59,507
Dead.

570
00:59:00,925 --> 00:59:04,470
Yes, Mrs. Roosevelt went down
into the mines.

571
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:08,850
And when they asked her why,
she said, "I am my husband's legs."

572
00:59:09,058 --> 00:59:13,396
Did you tell cripple jokes too?
Is there anything that isn't a joke?

573
00:59:19,861 --> 00:59:21,029
Sorry.

574
00:59:23,615 --> 00:59:25,033
Who makes up jokes anyway?

575
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:26,826
J.J.'s old man.

576
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,581
Scads of swell material here
for a good novel.

577
00:59:31,831 --> 00:59:33,458
If you wanna write about this.

578
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:36,753
People who tell jokes
instead of feeling something.

579
00:59:36,961 --> 00:59:38,671
Let's meet every five years...

580
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:41,799
...or every time a President conks.
Whichever's sooner!

581
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,636
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing here?

582
00:59:44,844 --> 00:59:49,224
J.J.'s gonna buy your book and
we're all gonna go to Hollywood?

583
00:59:49,432 --> 00:59:50,266
Take it easy.

584
00:59:50,475 --> 00:59:52,644
Lots of writers went there.
Fitzgerald...

585
00:59:52,852 --> 00:59:54,687
- He's dead!
- I know that.

586
00:59:54,896 --> 00:59:57,857
It's none of your business anyway.
He died of booze...

587
00:59:58,066 --> 01:00:00,527
...and people like you!
- Damn it, stop it!

588
01:00:03,738 --> 01:00:05,073
He's sorry for the joke.

589
01:00:05,365 --> 01:00:09,661
Why did you bring me here?
Couldn't we have gone for a walk...

590
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:13,081
...or sit on a bench?
- I didn't want to feel sadder.

591
01:00:13,331 --> 01:00:17,836
- What's wrong with feeling sadder?
- It won't help! The President died!

592
01:00:18,044 --> 01:00:22,590
And everything in the world that
happens doesn't just happen to you.

593
01:00:25,593 --> 01:00:26,427
Behave yourself.

594
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:29,430
I don't care about behaving myself!

595
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:32,225
Then don't. Do what you want.

596
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:35,353
I wanna get out of here.

597
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,230
All right.

598
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,196
I meant us.

599
01:00:47,115 --> 01:00:48,908
And then what?

600
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:17,061
See you later, Katie.

601
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:19,564
Oh, yeah, see you.

602
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:25,612
Good night, my beauty.
You can finish in the morning.

603
01:01:37,874 --> 01:01:38,875
Cheer up.

604
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:42,921
I'm about to have a big night and
I wanna think of you as smiling.

605
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:47,300
Good night, Billy.

606
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:07,570
Hi.

607
01:02:08,404 --> 01:02:09,239
Hi.

608
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:13,159
Gee, I thought you
got sent overseas.

609
01:02:13,868 --> 01:02:15,245
Could I talk to you?

610
01:02:17,121 --> 01:02:18,039
Sure.

611
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:31,261
Listen, I was a bad girl.
I know that. But I'm better now.

612
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:35,098
It was like a tantrum.
I get them from time to time.

613
01:02:35,348 --> 01:02:36,724
It's like an eclipse.

614
01:02:36,975 --> 01:02:38,977
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

615
01:02:39,185 --> 01:02:43,815
I wanted to have an apology dinner.
I thought I'd fill my icebox...

616
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:47,986
I'm a pain in the ass, aren't I?

617
01:02:49,445 --> 01:02:51,322
I go to swearing school now.

618
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:53,658
Soundproof school.
I'm up to the F's.

619
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:57,120
I'm taking a laughing course
and studying Protestant cookery.

620
01:02:57,328 --> 01:02:58,288
Don't.

621
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:04,252
Are you finished?

622
01:03:14,762 --> 01:03:15,597
Look, Katie...

623
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:18,600
Please don't start with "Look."
It's always bad news.

624
01:03:20,768 --> 01:03:23,605
I don't think we're gonna
make it, Katie.

625
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:29,819
Why?

626
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:34,240
I just don't think it's
gonna work, that's all.

627
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:41,206
I was too easy for you.

628
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:42,624
Easy?

629
01:03:42,874 --> 01:03:45,543
I don't mean sexually.

630
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:48,421
I mean easy like
everything is for you.

631
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,757
You really think you're easy?

632
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:54,761
Compared to what?
The Hundred Years' War?

633
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:57,889
You're so ready to fight,
you have no time to understand.

634
01:03:58,097 --> 01:04:00,600
Counterattack, politics,
revolution, cause!

635
01:04:01,142 --> 01:04:04,896
That's all fine for you.
So stay with it. I admire it.

636
01:04:05,104 --> 01:04:07,065
- Up to a point.
- That's right!

637
01:04:07,273 --> 01:04:11,277
Okay, okay! Don't belabour it.
I get it. I get it.

638
01:04:12,737 --> 01:04:16,449
I don't fit on Beekman Place,
that's what's really wrong.

639
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:23,331
- You think that's what I'm talking...
- Yes!

640
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:25,333
No demands, just fun, laughs.

641
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:29,337
Good! Go! Go have a good time
on Beekman Place.

642
01:04:29,546 --> 01:04:33,049
You wanna end it like
a gentleman, you have. So get out!

643
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:43,935
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

644
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:56,656
I'm calm now, Hubbell.

645
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:00,410
You can go.

646
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:02,615
It's me.

647
01:07:10,957 --> 01:07:12,000
Hubbell...

648
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:17,213
Wait a minute, hold on.

649
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,635
Don't go away.

650
01:07:26,055 --> 01:07:27,432
Listen, Hubbell...

651
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:30,768
...this is kind of peculiar.

652
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:37,484
I know that I don't have to apologize
for what I said because...

653
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:39,527
...I know that you know.

654
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:40,904
And...

655
01:07:42,614 --> 01:07:44,157
...I also know that you...

656
01:07:44,407 --> 01:07:48,495
...you know that I don't feel exactly
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed...

657
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:50,163
...as J.J. Would say.

658
01:07:52,707 --> 01:07:55,793
Anyway, the peculiar thing is...

659
01:07:56,503 --> 01:08:00,173
...it's really a request,
you know, a favour.

660
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:04,761
You see, I can't sleep, Hubbell...

661
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:11,267
...it would help me so much
if you could...

662
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:14,354
Well, if I had someone to talk to.

663
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:18,566
You know, if I had a best
friend or something...

664
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:20,610
...to talk about it with.

665
01:08:21,653 --> 01:08:23,738
Only you're my best friend.

666
01:08:24,656 --> 01:08:26,407
Isn't that dumb?

667
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:27,867
So dumb.

668
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:30,411
You're the best friend I ever had.

669
01:08:37,252 --> 01:08:41,714
It would help me so much if you'd
come over and see me through tonight.

670
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:48,138
Hubbell, I promise
I won't touch you...

671
01:08:48,429 --> 01:08:50,014
...or beg you...

672
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:53,143
...or embarrass you.

673
01:08:53,518 --> 01:08:58,356
But I have to talk to my best
friend about someone we both know.

674
01:08:59,023 --> 01:09:03,862
So could... Hubbell, could you please
come over right away, please?

675
01:09:23,256 --> 01:09:25,884
There's some sleeping pills
in the cabinet.

676
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:37,854
Here.

677
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:41,733
Isn't one enough?

678
01:09:41,941 --> 01:09:42,775
No.

679
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:45,278
I'm scared.

680
01:09:45,945 --> 01:09:46,946
Take them.

681
01:09:48,406 --> 01:09:50,700
Will you stay till I fall asleep?

682
01:10:09,552 --> 01:10:11,554
I'm really sorry.

683
01:10:14,432 --> 01:10:16,976
But that's what
best friends are for.

684
01:10:17,727 --> 01:10:19,187
Aren't they?

685
01:10:25,527 --> 01:10:27,612
There's something I wanna ask you.

686
01:10:32,492 --> 01:10:35,745
Hope this doesn't make me drunk
instead of sleepy.

687
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:37,831
Don't drink it like water.

688
01:10:43,044 --> 01:10:45,547
Is it because I'm not
attractive enough?

689
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:50,969
I'm not fishing, really. I'm not.

690
01:10:52,178 --> 01:10:54,097
I know I'm attractive.

691
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:56,808
Sort of.

692
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,228
But...

693
01:11:02,897 --> 01:11:05,150
...I'm not attractive in the...

694
01:11:05,358 --> 01:11:08,069
I'm not attractive in the right way.

695
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:10,363
Am I?

696
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:13,908
I mean...

697
01:11:16,494 --> 01:11:18,705
...I don't have the right style...

698
01:11:19,831 --> 01:11:21,207
...for you.

699
01:11:23,126 --> 01:11:23,960
Do I?

700
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:29,883
Be my friend.

701
01:11:37,515 --> 01:11:39,559
You don't have the right style.

702
01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:41,019
I'll change.

703
01:11:41,519 --> 01:11:44,939
Don't. You're your own girl.
You have your own style.

704
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:47,650
But then I won't have you.

705
01:11:47,859 --> 01:11:50,278
Why can't I have you? Why?

706
01:11:50,862 --> 01:11:53,740
Because you push too hard.

707
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:58,119
Every damn minute.

708
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:04,209
There's no time to relax
and enjoy living.

709
01:12:04,751 --> 01:12:06,628
Everything's too serious.

710
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:10,048
I push too hard because
I want things to be better.

711
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:12,759
I want us to be better,
you to be better.

712
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:16,137
Sure I make waves, you have to.
I'll keep making them...

713
01:12:16,346 --> 01:12:18,515
...till you're everything
you should be.

714
01:12:18,723 --> 01:12:23,228
You'll never find anyone to believe
in you this much or love you as much.

715
01:12:23,436 --> 01:12:25,313
- I know that.
- Well then, why?

716
01:12:25,522 --> 01:12:28,441
You think if I come back it'll
be okay by magic?

717
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:29,859
What'll be different?

718
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:33,613
- We'll be wrong. We'll both lose.
- Couldn't we both win?

719
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,789
I like Hollywood. I like Alice Faye.

720
01:12:42,997 --> 01:12:45,250
Don't. Don't. No, please.

721
01:13:05,979 --> 01:13:07,772
Somebody's getting up.

722
01:13:08,773 --> 01:13:09,941
Aren't you sleepy?

723
01:13:13,987 --> 01:13:15,363
You are.

724
01:13:17,407 --> 01:13:19,033
I'm exhausted.

725
01:13:21,494 --> 01:13:23,454
Katie, you expect so much.

726
01:13:25,874 --> 01:13:27,917
Oh, but look what I've got.

727
01:15:53,396 --> 01:15:55,690
Jesus! Your director lives here?

728
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:59,027
Actually, he lives off the garage.
The servants live here.

729
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:00,487
How can he work here?

730
01:16:00,737 --> 01:16:03,573
Bissinger doesn't work,
he's the director.

731
01:16:03,865 --> 01:16:07,535
As long as you're writing in
France by next fall, I don't care.

732
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:16,544
- Everybody's here.
- Everybody who's anybody.

733
01:16:17,837 --> 01:16:20,423
- No ice skating rink?
- It's in the cellar.

734
01:16:20,632 --> 01:16:21,966
- Hubbell!
- Hi, George.

735
01:16:22,175 --> 01:16:24,093
George Bissinger.
Glad you came.

736
01:16:24,677 --> 01:16:25,929
My wife, Vicki.

737
01:16:26,179 --> 01:16:28,097
- How are you?
- It's Kate, isn't it?

738
01:16:28,306 --> 01:16:29,140
It's Katie.

739
01:16:29,349 --> 01:16:31,309
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.

740
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:33,269
Rhea!

741
01:16:34,604 --> 01:16:36,105
I want you to meet my agent.

742
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:38,358
Reportedly the greatest in town.

743
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:41,528
If I were a great agent,
would I be an agent?

744
01:16:41,736 --> 01:16:44,864
- Nice to meet you.
- You think those are croquet balls...

745
01:16:45,073 --> 01:16:47,575
...but it's her collection
of shrunken heads.

746
01:16:47,784 --> 01:16:50,537
Have you seen the
Bissinger collection?

747
01:16:50,787 --> 01:16:55,166
You think these Hollywood intellectuals
plan to overthrow the government?

748
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,335
They couldn't overthrow
Louella Parsons.

749
01:16:57,544 --> 01:17:00,296
In '37, in Munich,
Hitler was a joke too.

750
01:17:00,547 --> 01:17:03,133
Paula Reisner,
our resident pessimist.

751
01:17:03,341 --> 01:17:04,759
Sorry. I'm sorry.

752
01:17:04,968 --> 01:17:09,639
They're coming to investigate
all us communist subversives.

753
01:17:09,848 --> 01:17:13,852
They're out to get election yardage
from the silver screen.

754
01:17:14,102 --> 01:17:16,354
They're getting people
to testify secretly.

755
01:17:17,272 --> 01:17:18,398
Horses' asses.

756
01:17:18,606 --> 01:17:22,777
Maybe. But we can't even write our
congressman. He's on the committee.

757
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:24,070
Your shot, George.

758
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:28,408
<i>- Alice in Wonderland. Come on.
- Thank you.</i>

759
01:17:28,616 --> 01:17:31,202
You're not home
making the script brilliant?

760
01:17:31,411 --> 01:17:34,539
Listen to the producer.
You don't even understand it.

761
01:17:34,789 --> 01:17:37,041
I'm glad you came.
I was gonna call you.

762
01:17:37,292 --> 01:17:39,752
I'm giving J.J. A birthday party.

763
01:17:39,961 --> 01:17:42,839
- 45, huh?
- You gotta come as a Marx Brother.

764
01:17:43,047 --> 01:17:46,384
- K-K-Katie, you could come as Karl.
- Still stuttering?

765
01:17:50,096 --> 01:17:51,848
I'm not coming as Groucho.

766
01:17:52,056 --> 01:17:55,143
Come as Harpo, that way you
won't be able to talk.

767
01:17:57,687 --> 01:17:59,939
I think your director's an idiot.

768
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:10,408
Too high? Too low?

769
01:18:10,658 --> 01:18:12,410
Trying to tell me something?

770
01:18:12,619 --> 01:18:15,663
What? He's here?
In the room? Good God!

771
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:20,752
Ten years in Leavenworth, 11 years in
twelveworth, or 5 and 10 in Woolworth.

772
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,921
- To control thought.
Censorship.

773
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:25,757
Let's not dramatize this.
It'll all blow over.

774
01:18:25,965 --> 01:18:29,719
- That line is necessary.
- It's the point of the whole scene.

775
01:18:29,928 --> 01:18:32,889
The point's made by the
dancers in red, white and blue.

776
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:37,018
There are no dancers in his book.
You can't just have dancers.

777
01:18:37,227 --> 01:18:38,061
Please.

778
01:18:38,269 --> 01:18:41,064
Brooks, if we get this organized,
you've got to talk.

779
01:18:41,314 --> 01:18:43,775
- I can't talk in front...
- Come on, Brooks.

780
01:18:44,025 --> 01:18:46,903
- It's gorgeous if you do.
- I'll write, all right?

781
01:18:47,111 --> 01:18:48,696
He doesn't understand.

782
01:18:48,905 --> 01:18:52,534
- I never liked his movies anyway.
- "Honk-honk," said the duck.

783
01:18:52,784 --> 01:18:54,869
You rang?
Your wish is my command.

784
01:18:55,078 --> 01:18:57,664
This morning I shot
an elephant in my pyjamas...

785
01:18:57,872 --> 01:19:01,459
- What are you hungry for?
- I'm hungry for your absence.

786
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,087
- Meeting at my house Sunday.

787
01:19:04,337 --> 01:19:08,758
- George, is Paula Reisner a Red?
- My heavens, I don't know. Why?

788
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:12,053
- It's something I heard.
- You listen to the wrong people.

789
01:19:12,262 --> 01:19:13,972
Come on. I have an early day.

790
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:25,650
- He thinks Bissinger's right.
- How dare you...

791
01:19:49,215 --> 01:19:50,258
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

792
01:19:50,717 --> 01:19:53,470
Could you stop?
This is coming out in French.

793
01:19:56,181 --> 01:19:58,808
Maybe Bissinger will like it
better in French.

794
01:19:59,517 --> 01:20:00,894
Taste this.

795
01:20:06,483 --> 01:20:07,775
How is it?

796
01:20:09,652 --> 01:20:10,904
It's great.

797
01:20:11,905 --> 01:20:14,908
I'll study French cooking while
you finish your novel.

798
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:16,951
Done much thinking about it?

799
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:18,870
No, not much.

800
01:20:19,078 --> 01:20:21,915
Well, it's very hard here, you know.

801
01:20:22,123 --> 01:20:24,417
But when we're ensconced
in our villa...

802
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:27,545
How about you? Have you read
any good books lately?

803
01:20:27,754 --> 01:20:31,549
No, but I wrote two reports of books
that haven't been written yet.

804
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:34,719
- You'll get the sack.
- I'll go back to brain surgery.

805
01:20:36,095 --> 01:20:39,891
They never read my synopses anyway.
They just pay me for them.

806
01:20:40,099 --> 01:20:42,602
Why don't you quit? After all, it's...

807
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:45,146
I'm laying a nice
nest egg for France.

808
01:20:45,396 --> 01:20:46,314
- Italy.
- France.

809
01:20:46,523 --> 01:20:47,440
- Spain?
- Never.

810
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:51,194
China, maybe.
My phony synopsis takes place there.

811
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:53,029
China?

812
01:20:53,863 --> 01:20:57,534
Public's fed up with Westerns, Myrna.
High time we had an Eastern.

813
01:20:57,742 --> 01:20:58,576
Got a title?

814
01:21:00,328 --> 01:21:02,664
<i>Shevuos! Exclamation point.</i>

815
01:21:02,914 --> 01:21:04,040
Sounds catchy.

816
01:21:04,249 --> 01:21:07,377
There's a kibbutz of Chinese Jews
living in a rice paddy.

817
01:21:07,585 --> 01:21:10,755
- And he...?
- No, she cooks communist rice patties.

818
01:21:12,298 --> 01:21:13,424
He gets the idea...

819
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:15,718
Of calling them matzos.

820
01:21:15,927 --> 01:21:16,886
You read the book!

821
01:21:17,095 --> 01:21:18,471
Backwards.

822
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,557
Oh, I got one for you.

823
01:21:21,057 --> 01:21:22,433
I can't take another one.

824
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:24,936
Loudmouthed Jewish girl...

825
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,232
...from New York City,
comes to Malibu, California...

826
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,527
...tells her gorgeous goyisher guy...
- Good alliteration.

827
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:37,240
...that she's pregnant, you see.
And...

828
01:21:38,783 --> 01:21:42,745
...and he just looks at her and...

829
01:21:57,343 --> 01:21:58,720
Are you kidding?

830
01:22:04,309 --> 01:22:07,061
- Don't be afraid to touch.
- I'm not.

831
01:22:23,203 --> 01:22:24,787
Get it, Katie, sweetheart!

832
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:27,916
All right, one more time.

833
01:22:36,758 --> 01:22:38,343
<i>- Hungry?
- Answer the question!</i>

834
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:41,387
<i>You have no right
to make me name the names...</i>

835
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:44,474
<i>Sergeant! Take the witness away.</i>

836
01:22:44,682 --> 01:22:47,310
<i>You've just heard
ex cerpts from today's...</i>

837
01:22:47,519 --> 01:22:49,854
<i>... session of the
House Un-American...</i>

838
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:51,940
- I'll make the salad.
- Thank you.

839
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:54,567
Watch out, the paint
takes forever to dry.

840
01:22:54,776 --> 01:22:58,988
- You'll be in Beverly Hills by then.
- France, not Beverly Hills.

841
01:22:59,197 --> 01:23:01,741
Not if Hubbell gets
the deal I'm working on.

842
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:02,992
What deal?

843
01:23:03,243 --> 01:23:06,913
Three more pictures. Provided this one
works out of course.

844
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:10,792
- Think he's interested?
- I certainly hope so.

845
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,672
It'll mean a lot more money, Kate.
You and Hubbell could live in style.

846
01:23:17,048 --> 01:23:18,800
I thought we did, Rhea.

847
01:23:21,594 --> 01:23:23,429
Pop sent me a list of names.

848
01:23:23,638 --> 01:23:27,350
"For my grandson, the following
names are okay with me:

849
01:23:27,559 --> 01:23:31,646
Thomas Jefferson Gardiner,
Solomon David Gardiner...

850
01:23:31,855 --> 01:23:34,440
...and Eugene V. Debs Gardiner."

851
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,359
What if it's a girl?

852
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:39,696
If it's a girl, there's only
one name, my mother's.

853
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:41,322
Yeah, what's that?

854
01:23:41,573 --> 01:23:42,991
Rachel.

855
01:23:46,494 --> 01:23:48,621
So keep your fingers crossed.

856
01:24:21,654 --> 01:24:23,239
What's this picture about?

857
01:24:23,448 --> 01:24:25,158
Cowboys and Indians.

858
01:24:25,408 --> 01:24:27,368
Not too loud. Brooks wrote it.

859
01:24:27,702 --> 01:24:31,164
- Tonight, the Indians are the good guys.
- Can you do that?

860
01:24:31,372 --> 01:24:33,500
Well, it's un-American,
but we can try.

861
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,294
I think I'm calm enough.
Vicki, let's start.

862
01:24:36,503 --> 01:24:40,548
Don't try the trick with the sunglasses.
I know when you're sleeping.

863
01:24:41,758 --> 01:24:43,885
- The best Western I've ever read.

864
01:24:44,135 --> 01:24:45,553
I mean it.

865
01:24:47,055 --> 01:24:49,474
There they are.
Hey, Velez and Yolanda.

866
01:24:49,682 --> 01:24:52,227
- I saved you guys a seat.
- Thank you.

867
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:55,355
- We didn't miss anything, did we?
- All right, Floyd.

868
01:24:56,689 --> 01:24:59,526
- How's my godchild?
- Very happy.

869
01:25:08,952 --> 01:25:10,245
My God.

870
01:25:12,038 --> 01:25:13,790
What the hell is going on?

871
01:25:17,126 --> 01:25:19,546
- What did it, George?
- Your Picasso!

872
01:25:20,255 --> 01:25:21,506
What's the trouble?

873
01:25:24,425 --> 01:25:27,387
Testing. Do you get us?

874
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,681
What the hell is going on?

875
01:25:31,266 --> 01:25:33,101
We're being recorded.

876
01:25:37,772 --> 01:25:40,817
- Would you knock it off up there?
- Floyd, stop it!

877
01:25:41,442 --> 01:25:42,360
Can't hear me.

878
01:25:42,569 --> 01:25:44,571
Floyd, hold it!

879
01:25:46,823 --> 01:25:50,618
I'm going to sue the U.S.
Government for that painting.

880
01:25:51,327 --> 01:25:54,622
We've got to do something.
Do you have a lawyer?

881
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:57,041
Shouldn't we let him know
what happened?

882
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,752
How do we know this room
isn't bugged too?

883
01:25:59,961 --> 01:26:05,049
- This country wouldn't believe this.
- They'll never know about this.

884
01:26:05,258 --> 01:26:07,927
We can't let this happen.
We have rights.

885
01:26:08,136 --> 01:26:12,098
- Can't the studios do something?
- We have got to do something. We.

886
01:26:13,141 --> 01:26:15,435
Bissinger says this scene
isn't necessary.

887
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,520
I told him he's wrong.

888
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:19,606
What do you think?

889
01:26:19,814 --> 01:26:22,775
- He's the director.
- You're the producer!

890
01:26:23,026 --> 01:26:24,611
Easy, will you?

891
01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:29,407
Yeah, easy.

892
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:33,578
Hey, Hub.

893
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,373
Do you know what's going on
over at your house?

894
01:26:37,582 --> 01:26:38,416
Sure.

895
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:39,709
You know?

896
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:42,378
Overthrowing the government,
I suppose.

897
01:26:42,629 --> 01:26:44,506
Let's see, Sunday's volleyball...

898
01:26:44,923 --> 01:26:48,259
Yeah, they like to overthrow
the government on Monday.

899
01:26:48,468 --> 01:26:51,304
They're going to D.C.
To challenge the committee...

900
01:26:51,513 --> 01:26:53,598
...on the basis of
the First Amendment.

901
01:26:56,392 --> 01:26:57,227
What?

902
01:27:02,982 --> 01:27:04,442
Well, well.

903
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:09,072
- Think anybody knows what it says?
- Katie does.

904
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:13,409
That's for sure.

905
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:15,411
Some actor comes up to me...

906
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,456
...and says this line
doesn't make any sense.

907
01:27:19,123 --> 01:27:20,083
What do you think?

908
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:24,587
If they go, it'll make more trouble.
They may not have jobs to come back to.

909
01:27:24,796 --> 01:27:26,673
What do you want from me?

910
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:29,425
Tell Katie to stay out of it.

911
01:27:30,593 --> 01:27:31,427
You tell her.

912
01:27:32,053 --> 01:27:33,054
I will.

913
01:27:34,347 --> 01:27:35,932
I'll buy tickets to that.

914
01:27:38,268 --> 01:27:40,311
Would you just tell her to go easy?

915
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:44,023
Sure. You tell Bissinger to go easy.
You're the producer.

916
01:27:44,232 --> 01:27:45,525
What's eating you?

917
01:27:45,984 --> 01:27:49,279
Nothing. The war's over, right?

918
01:27:52,866 --> 01:27:53,908
Movies...

919
01:27:59,497 --> 01:28:02,458
Do you realize this is the first
job we've ever had?

920
01:28:04,127 --> 01:28:06,421
Athletic Scholarship.
Doesn't that count?

921
01:28:07,088 --> 01:28:08,715
Doesn't count, buddy.

922
01:28:08,923 --> 01:28:12,469
Well, then, Officer,
Landing Craft, South Pacific?

923
01:28:12,677 --> 01:28:13,678
Nope.

924
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:17,056
Why? We got paid $150 a month.

925
01:28:18,016 --> 01:28:19,309
Doesn't count.

926
01:28:20,852 --> 01:28:23,062
- You want a drink?
- No.

927
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:30,695
There's a little trouble at home.
I have to keep my wits about me.

928
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:38,912
Old Carol Ann.

929
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:45,502
Don't take any crap.
To the both of us.

930
01:28:48,338 --> 01:28:52,050
And all the absent friends,
class of '37.

931
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,979
- Is this the Gardiner house?
- And I'm the gardener.

932
01:29:05,188 --> 01:29:07,690
- How are you doing?
- Okay, so far...

933
01:29:09,192 --> 01:29:13,363
Your lover chain smokes, no doubt to
compensate for his extreme shortness.

934
01:29:13,571 --> 01:29:16,074
He has an enormous heart
and no sense of humour.

935
01:29:16,282 --> 01:29:17,742
You found us out.

936
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:21,204
Calls himself Brooks Kropatkin,
but it's not his real name.

937
01:29:21,412 --> 01:29:23,373
- What is it?
- Carpenter.

938
01:29:23,623 --> 01:29:25,834
Carpenter! Who told you that?

939
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:28,211
J.J. With whom I was not drinking...

940
01:29:28,419 --> 01:29:31,464
...since he no longer drinks
due to trouble at home.

941
01:29:33,216 --> 01:29:36,469
Well, Carol Ann's 33.
Not many moves left.

942
01:29:36,678 --> 01:29:39,222
Well, we're all 33, practically.

943
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:41,724
Not you. Not the quiz kid.

944
01:29:41,933 --> 01:29:43,768
What were you, 16 in college?

945
01:29:47,897 --> 01:29:49,149
What's gonna happen?

946
01:29:50,275 --> 01:29:52,318
You're going to Washington.

947
01:29:53,987 --> 01:29:56,281
I meant with J.J. And Carol Ann.

948
01:29:56,865 --> 01:30:00,535
That's another house. In this house,
the wife is going to D.C.

949
01:30:04,372 --> 01:30:05,874
Gonna take the baby with you?

950
01:30:08,251 --> 01:30:09,586
I thought I might.

951
01:30:15,216 --> 01:30:17,051
Nothing like an early education.

952
01:30:18,678 --> 01:30:20,930
I'd like her to learn
not to be frightened.

953
01:30:21,139 --> 01:30:22,223
Her?

954
01:30:23,475 --> 01:30:24,309
Him.

955
01:30:25,727 --> 01:30:27,562
Why don't you come with us?

956
01:30:31,733 --> 01:30:34,486
We're kind of back
where we started, aren't we?

957
01:30:37,322 --> 01:30:39,240
That's not true, Hubbell.

958
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:46,873
Okay. Now why don't
we all stay home?

959
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:52,420
I can't.

960
01:30:52,629 --> 01:30:55,507
<i>- And named the names of
14 of his fellow actors.</i>

961
01:30:55,715 --> 01:30:58,426
<i>He described their
various associations...</i>

962
01:30:58,676 --> 01:31:00,929
<i>... with subversive organizations.</i>

963
01:31:01,137 --> 01:31:04,224
<i>Ten men of the original 19
who refused to testify...</i>

964
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,446
And there he is...

965
01:31:18,655 --> 01:31:22,075
...Jack Armstrong,
the all-American boy.

966
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,456
- Hey, you look good.
- I hate it!

967
01:31:32,544 --> 01:31:33,586
I like it!

968
01:31:33,795 --> 01:31:36,673
Isn't she lovely?
America's sweetheart.

969
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:45,557
Look at her go. I'd forgotten.
She really was getting to those people.

970
01:31:45,807 --> 01:31:48,476
Take a look at some of those faces.

971
01:31:48,726 --> 01:31:51,354
Oh, she was a spellbinder.

972
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,107
I'd forgotten about that.

973
01:31:57,443 --> 01:31:58,862
She's beautiful.

974
01:32:20,675 --> 01:32:22,093
I'm exhausted.

975
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,805
Do you have any comment
regarding the Hollywood 10?

976
01:32:26,014 --> 01:32:30,393
They're running toward martyrdom
for nothing but their own destruction.

977
01:32:30,643 --> 01:32:32,604
They're standing up for principle.

978
01:32:32,812 --> 01:32:35,106
If you don't like this
country, get out!

979
01:32:35,315 --> 01:32:36,316
It's my country too!

980
01:32:36,524 --> 01:32:38,943
They could've denied everything.

981
01:32:39,194 --> 01:32:40,737
They didn't want to.

982
01:32:40,945 --> 01:32:42,572
Can we do this
someplace else?

983
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,408
Why are you here?
You might get put on a list.

984
01:32:45,658 --> 01:32:47,076
I refuse to be intimidated.

985
01:32:47,327 --> 01:32:49,871
Well, those 10 men feel
exactly the same way.

986
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:52,373
Free speech is all
we're talking about.

987
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:57,337
They're fighting for your right
to make any movie you want.

988
01:32:57,545 --> 01:33:01,424
And all you can do is strut
around here making simple remarks.

989
01:33:05,178 --> 01:33:08,097
Could we get a statement
from Mrs. Gardiner?

990
01:33:08,556 --> 01:33:12,685
I'd like to ask these people
why they think we just fought a war.

991
01:33:12,977 --> 01:33:15,772
What are you people afraid of?

992
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,316
Shut your mouth, you commie bitch!

993
01:33:49,806 --> 01:33:52,225
You two wait here
till the crowd clears.

994
01:33:59,691 --> 01:34:00,859
Are you okay?

995
01:34:03,027 --> 01:34:04,237
You're bleeding.

996
01:34:04,487 --> 01:34:06,072
I'm fine.

997
01:34:07,073 --> 01:34:09,409
It's always fun
meeting trains, you know?

998
01:34:10,493 --> 01:34:14,414
I'm sorry, Hubbell.
I really didn't expect this.

999
01:34:16,249 --> 01:34:20,044
You didn't expect to get a chance
to tell off the world either.

1000
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:25,383
- Is that what you think I'm doing?
- You bet I do.

1001
01:34:25,592 --> 01:34:27,927
I'm not telling off the world.

1002
01:34:28,178 --> 01:34:31,139
I'm just standing up
for something I believe in.

1003
01:34:31,347 --> 01:34:34,476
You're not angry when
Bissinger ridicules those men?

1004
01:34:34,726 --> 01:34:37,937
Calling them martyrs because
they have guts...

1005
01:34:38,146 --> 01:34:42,192
...to fight for their Bill of Rights,
his Bill of Rights and yours!

1006
01:34:42,442 --> 01:34:44,903
We don't have any Bill of Rights.

1007
01:34:45,111 --> 01:34:47,155
We'll never have free speech.

1008
01:34:47,405 --> 01:34:49,949
We never will if people
won't take a stand.

1009
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:53,244
We never will have because
people are scared.

1010
01:34:53,495 --> 01:34:55,121
This isn't college.

1011
01:34:55,371 --> 01:34:59,375
This is grown-up politics, Katie.
And it's stupid and dangerous.

1012
01:34:59,626 --> 01:35:02,420
You're telling me to shut up
because it's dangerous?

1013
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:04,464
I'm telling you it's a waste.

1014
01:35:04,672 --> 01:35:07,217
And that those men
are only gonna get hurt.

1015
01:35:07,425 --> 01:35:09,719
And that nothing is gonna change.

1016
01:35:09,969 --> 01:35:12,597
And after jail,
after years of bad blood...

1017
01:35:12,806 --> 01:35:17,936
...when it's practical for a fascist
producer to hire a communist writer...

1018
01:35:18,144 --> 01:35:20,563
...because his movie's
in trouble, he'll do it.

1019
01:35:20,772 --> 01:35:24,317
They'll make movies, have dinner,
they'll play tennis...

1020
01:35:24,567 --> 01:35:28,822
...make passes at each other's wives.
What did anybody go to jail for?

1021
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:31,157
For what? A political spat?

1022
01:35:31,407 --> 01:35:36,538
You're telling me to close my eyes
and watch people being destroyed...

1023
01:35:37,038 --> 01:35:40,750
...so you can work in a town
that doesn't have spine enough...

1024
01:35:40,959 --> 01:35:43,086
...to stand up for
anything but a buck!

1025
01:35:43,294 --> 01:35:47,590
I'm telling you that people are more
important than a goddamn witch hunt.

1026
01:35:47,799 --> 01:35:50,927
You and me. Not causes.
Not principles.

1027
01:35:51,136 --> 01:35:54,764
Hubbell, people are their principles.

1028
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:08,945
The heads of the studios have
reversed their positions...

1029
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:12,866
...and any employee who...

1030
01:36:13,116 --> 01:36:16,244
...is an unfriendly witness
before the committee is...

1031
01:36:17,412 --> 01:36:18,705
...fired.

1032
01:36:20,957 --> 01:36:22,876
Oh, Jesus.

1033
01:36:23,084 --> 01:36:25,253
So now we have an official blacklist.

1034
01:36:25,795 --> 01:36:28,339
It's an open season
for witch hunters...

1035
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:31,342
...and stool pigeons.

1036
01:36:32,302 --> 01:36:35,763
And now the problem is,
how to convince the public...

1037
01:36:35,972 --> 01:36:40,477
...that a stool pigeon is a hero.

1038
01:36:41,102 --> 01:36:44,397
You are like these
damn palm trees.

1039
01:36:44,647 --> 01:36:49,194
They don't belong here either.
They were brought in and they look it.

1040
01:36:49,444 --> 01:36:52,739
I'm sure that they
don't like it either.

1041
01:36:52,989 --> 01:36:56,451
- What if he does, Paula?
- What is more important to you?

1042
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,787
He is.

1043
01:37:01,831 --> 01:37:04,793
That's your choice, Katie.

1044
01:37:10,215 --> 01:37:12,926
- Give him my love too.
- I will.

1045
01:37:13,343 --> 01:37:14,803
Thanks, Paula.

1046
01:37:19,015 --> 01:37:22,977
It's no reflection on anything
except that you're new to this...

1047
01:37:23,228 --> 01:37:25,063
...film technique.

1048
01:37:25,313 --> 01:37:29,859
Especially for the novelist.
He's too close to his own material.

1049
01:37:30,109 --> 01:37:32,737
I'm not a novelist.

1050
01:37:32,946 --> 01:37:35,031
I'd like to think of myself...

1051
01:37:36,741 --> 01:37:37,867
...as a screenwriter.

1052
01:37:38,076 --> 01:37:40,078
I wanna be up front with you.

1053
01:37:40,286 --> 01:37:42,539
I know what changes have to be made.

1054
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:46,084
But can you make them?

1055
01:37:46,334 --> 01:37:50,463
Nobody else understands that story.
Nobody knows it. It's mine.

1056
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:52,924
Mine.

1057
01:37:56,344 --> 01:37:57,762
I know where it came from.

1058
01:37:58,263 --> 01:38:00,473
I know what the heart of it is.

1059
01:38:05,353 --> 01:38:08,606
You remember those few days
before the war started.

1060
01:38:09,274 --> 01:38:14,404
Before we had to change...
You don't lose what I know about it.

1061
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:16,990
Work with me.

1062
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:18,867
Work with me closely, fine.

1063
01:38:19,117 --> 01:38:22,745
And I know the dialogue from the book
is slowing the film up.

1064
01:38:22,954 --> 01:38:24,664
But I can fix that.

1065
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:29,461
I learn fast. I always have.

1066
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:30,545
Things come...

1067
01:38:39,304 --> 01:38:40,847
Christ, I can do it.

1068
01:38:41,556 --> 01:38:44,476
I know what you want.
I know what your concept is.

1069
01:38:46,352 --> 01:38:48,229
I'll make your changes.

1070
01:38:50,482 --> 01:38:51,524
Let me.

1071
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:55,528
With no resistance?

1072
01:38:58,615 --> 01:38:59,449
No.

1073
01:39:00,825 --> 01:39:02,535
No resistance.

1074
01:39:19,511 --> 01:39:20,512
Bad times?

1075
01:39:22,931 --> 01:39:24,933
Can't be all bad.

1076
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:28,436
How's the picture?

1077
01:39:31,272 --> 01:39:32,565
Troubled.

1078
01:39:34,067 --> 01:39:35,568
I'm going back to New York.

1079
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:39,739
New York.

1080
01:39:55,296 --> 01:39:56,506
When do you leave?

1081
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,091
Not until tomorrow.

1082
01:40:03,972 --> 01:40:07,100
I'm getting rid of some things
in my apartment.

1083
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:09,352
There's some champagne.

1084
01:40:11,604 --> 01:40:12,856
For bon voyage.

1085
01:40:32,459 --> 01:40:36,254
Well, it's getting better.

1086
01:40:36,713 --> 01:40:37,922
Better...

1087
01:40:48,183 --> 01:40:50,226
It's most unusual.

1088
01:40:52,896 --> 01:40:57,942
When it's slow, it seems
necessary to be slow.

1089
01:40:58,151 --> 01:40:59,944
Of course, with the audience...

1090
01:41:00,153 --> 01:41:01,946
Thank you, Paula, my dear.

1091
01:41:02,155 --> 01:41:03,823
I'll have my brandy in bed.

1092
01:41:04,073 --> 01:41:07,785
We'll conduct the postmortem tomorrow.
Good night, Paula...

1093
01:41:08,036 --> 01:41:09,871
...Hubbell, J.J., silent Kate.

1094
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:12,332
Thank you, Floyd.
Thank you very much.

1095
01:41:13,249 --> 01:41:15,043
Good night, Mr. Bissinger.

1096
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:24,427
J.J., shall we go and have some wine?
You will tell me your problems...

1097
01:41:24,636 --> 01:41:29,766
...and I'll tell you how the
un-American gentlemen...

1098
01:41:29,974 --> 01:41:34,437
...offered to give me some names
to name in Washington.

1099
01:41:35,772 --> 01:41:37,565
Take care, darling.

1100
01:41:39,192 --> 01:41:41,569
True to life.
So true to life.

1101
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:45,907
I'll be up late, case you guys wanna
stop by on your way to the beach.

1102
01:42:02,132 --> 01:42:05,510
Well, that was a gripping experience.

1103
01:42:07,262 --> 01:42:09,514
"So true to life, darling."

1104
01:42:09,764 --> 01:42:12,600
<i>The only picture she
hasn't knocked is Potemkin.</i>

1105
01:42:13,017 --> 01:42:14,435
Probably a dyke anyway.

1106
01:42:14,853 --> 01:42:17,397
She is not.
She has two grandchildren.

1107
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:24,320
Katie, the day you die,
you'll still be a nice Jewish girl.

1108
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:29,576
Are you still a nice gentile boy?

1109
01:42:38,751 --> 01:42:40,336
I never was.

1110
01:42:43,506 --> 01:42:45,341
I only looked it to you.

1111
01:42:46,468 --> 01:42:48,511
- That's not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

1112
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:53,475
When you love someone, from Roosevelt
to me, you go deaf, dumb and blind.

1113
01:42:54,934 --> 01:42:56,603
Not blind, Hubbell.

1114
01:42:58,229 --> 01:43:00,148
And certainly not dumb.

1115
01:43:15,121 --> 01:43:16,206
Who told you?

1116
01:43:19,709 --> 01:43:21,002
A friend.

1117
01:43:23,963 --> 01:43:25,173
Some friend.

1118
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,426
Well, it's a friendly town...

1119
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:31,638
...if you don't mind having
your friends inform on you.

1120
01:43:34,516 --> 01:43:37,227
I suppose you'll say
it doesn't mean anything.

1121
01:43:39,604 --> 01:43:40,605
It doesn't.

1122
01:43:45,777 --> 01:43:49,322
Your picture will be a smash, Hubbell.
Congratulations.

1123
01:43:49,531 --> 01:43:51,449
But you didn't like it.

1124
01:43:53,201 --> 01:43:54,953
Let's say I appreciated it.

1125
01:43:56,454 --> 01:43:57,622
What didn't you like?

1126
01:43:57,831 --> 01:43:59,999
<i>Are you finished for the night, sir?</i>

1127
01:44:12,387 --> 01:44:13,221
Yes.

1128
01:44:14,222 --> 01:44:15,640
Thank you.

1129
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,939
Why did you have to go with her?

1130
01:44:30,864 --> 01:44:35,618
Tell me I'm not good enough.
Tell me I talk too much.

1131
01:44:36,119 --> 01:44:39,205
You don't like my perfume,
my family, my pot roast.

1132
01:44:40,748 --> 01:44:44,502
But you didn't have to go
back to Beekman Place, did you?

1133
01:44:53,052 --> 01:44:55,889
Katie, what's wrong with us...

1134
01:44:56,806 --> 01:44:59,142
...has nothing to do with another girl.

1135
01:45:03,688 --> 01:45:05,482
Oh, give up.

1136
01:45:07,775 --> 01:45:08,651
Please.

1137
01:45:11,196 --> 01:45:14,991
I can't. I hate what
you did to your book.

1138
01:45:15,783 --> 01:45:17,327
I hate the picture.

1139
01:45:17,535 --> 01:45:20,705
I hate the palm trees.
I wish it would rain.

1140
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:22,582
Oh, I want...

1141
01:45:23,666 --> 01:45:25,293
I want...

1142
01:45:28,713 --> 01:45:29,714
What?

1143
01:45:32,425 --> 01:45:34,677
I want us to love each other.

1144
01:46:31,025 --> 01:46:31,901
Give me a beer.

1145
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:34,737
Coming up, skipper.
There you go.

1146
01:46:34,946 --> 01:46:39,159
What the hell. It doesn't
matter anyway. She wasn't much.

1147
01:46:39,409 --> 01:46:42,036
Don't get sloppy.
You had some good days.

1148
01:46:42,287 --> 01:46:43,913
It's the rum.

1149
01:46:46,374 --> 01:46:48,042
No excuse, buddy.

1150
01:46:49,335 --> 01:46:51,212
It's not like, you know...

1151
01:46:51,421 --> 01:46:54,591
...Iosing somebody like Katie.

1152
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:57,677
That would be a loss.

1153
01:47:07,103 --> 01:47:09,147
Best Saturday afternoon?

1154
01:47:10,273 --> 01:47:13,735
1933, when "Brute" Holland
was out with a bad knee.

1155
01:47:14,319 --> 01:47:15,236
Best month?

1156
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:16,654
April.

1157
01:47:17,572 --> 01:47:18,948
Best year?

1158
01:47:21,117 --> 01:47:22,494
Best year...

1159
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:24,078
1944.

1160
01:47:25,413 --> 01:47:28,541
No, '45...

1161
01:48:14,838 --> 01:48:18,591
It's amazing how decisions
are forced on you willy-nilly.

1162
01:48:30,353 --> 01:48:34,274
You never did want to finish
your book, did you?

1163
01:48:38,611 --> 01:48:39,863
I don't know.

1164
01:48:41,406 --> 01:48:43,575
I never thought there was much point.

1165
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:53,376
And you never really wanted
to go to France, did you?

1166
01:48:56,379 --> 01:48:59,090
No, I didn't. You wanted me to.

1167
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:05,513
Oh, boy.

1168
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:08,057
Oh, girl.

1169
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:10,101
Are you all right?

1170
01:49:21,404 --> 01:49:24,073
Wouldn't it be lovely
if we were old?

1171
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:27,827
We'd have survived all this.

1172
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:31,623
Everything would be
easy and uncomplicated.

1173
01:49:32,665 --> 01:49:34,918
The way it was when we were young.

1174
01:49:35,627 --> 01:49:37,670
It was never uncomplicated.

1175
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:43,676
But it was lovely.

1176
01:49:45,637 --> 01:49:47,013
Wasn't it?

1177
01:49:52,393 --> 01:49:55,313
Yeah. It was lovely.

1178
01:50:01,694 --> 01:50:03,780
Will you do me one favour, Hubbell?

1179
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:07,408
Stay with me till the baby's born?

1180
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:17,752
More flowers for you, Mrs. Gardiner.

1181
01:50:28,138 --> 01:50:29,222
I thought...

1182
01:50:30,974 --> 01:50:34,435
- It's a nice room.
- Yeah, it is.

1183
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:37,272
Did you get your father?

1184
01:50:42,652 --> 01:50:44,237
I'd like to call her Rachel.

1185
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:49,367
Fine.

1186
01:50:53,413 --> 01:50:54,789
Did you see her yet?

1187
01:51:01,754 --> 01:51:03,131
She's little.

1188
01:51:19,355 --> 01:51:22,108
I've got the crib together.

1189
01:53:02,917 --> 01:53:05,420
Oh, you don't have it ironed anymore!

1190
01:53:06,004 --> 01:53:07,547
- What?
- Your hair.

1191
01:53:08,965 --> 01:53:10,008
No, I don't.

1192
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:11,384
It's pretty.

1193
01:53:11,885 --> 01:53:12,719
Thank you.

1194
01:53:15,096 --> 01:53:15,930
Still married?

1195
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:18,850
Sure. What are you
doing in New York?

1196
01:53:20,226 --> 01:53:22,061
I've been writing a TV show.

1197
01:53:23,313 --> 01:53:24,147
Really?

1198
01:53:24,522 --> 01:53:27,150
There's an experience.
It happens so fast.

1199
01:53:27,358 --> 01:53:29,652
Shoot it in one day,
live, on the air.

1200
01:53:29,861 --> 01:53:32,363
Everybody in a constant
state of panic.

1201
01:53:32,614 --> 01:53:34,657
You remember how radio was.

1202
01:53:34,866 --> 01:53:35,742
Same thing...

1203
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:40,997
...only with cameras. And craziness!
Make a great comic novel.

1204
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:43,708
It sounds wonderful, really.

1205
01:53:48,046 --> 01:53:50,256
Your taxi's ready, sir.

1206
01:53:51,049 --> 01:53:54,469
I'm awfully late.
Please call and come for a drink?

1207
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:57,764
It's the only David X. Cohen
in the book.

1208
01:53:58,014 --> 01:53:59,224
What's the "X" for?

1209
01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:02,352
The only David X. Cohen in the book.

1210
01:54:05,355 --> 01:54:08,233
I'm sorry I'm late.
How are we doing, huh?

1211
01:54:08,483 --> 01:54:11,319
Oh, wonderful.
We've got 122 on that one.

1212
01:54:11,528 --> 01:54:14,030
And Charlene called.
She's doing great.

1213
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,533
- Marvellous.
- Wonderful.

1214
01:54:16,825 --> 01:54:19,202
That's a good one too,
don't you think?

1215
01:54:19,410 --> 01:54:20,537
What about Eileen?

1216
01:54:20,745 --> 01:54:22,789
You never give up, do you?

1217
01:54:35,885 --> 01:54:38,638
Only when I'm absolutely forced to.

1218
01:54:40,557 --> 01:54:42,183
But I'm a very good loser.

1219
01:54:44,519 --> 01:54:45,520
Better than I am.

1220
01:54:47,981 --> 01:54:49,274
Well, I've had...

1221
01:54:50,275 --> 01:54:51,943
...more practise.

1222
01:54:58,283 --> 01:55:00,160
Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.

1223
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:02,662
Bring her for a drink
when you come.

1224
01:55:06,249 --> 01:55:08,460
I can't come, Katie.

1225
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:10,712
I can't.

1226
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:14,716
I know.

1227
01:55:53,129 --> 01:55:53,963
How is she?

1228
01:55:56,466 --> 01:55:59,135
She is just beautiful.

1229
01:55:59,803 --> 01:56:01,679
You would be so proud of her.

1230
01:56:03,139 --> 01:56:04,766
I'm glad.

1231
01:56:08,812 --> 01:56:09,979
Is he a good father?

1232
01:56:10,855 --> 01:56:12,857
Yes. Very.

1233
01:56:15,485 --> 01:56:16,319
Good.

1234
01:56:37,423 --> 01:56:38,800
See you, Katie.

1235
01:56:44,556 --> 01:56:46,266
See you, Hubbell.

1236
01:56:56,151 --> 01:56:57,944
Ban the bomb!

1237
01:56:58,653 --> 01:57:02,532
Join the thousands of Americans
who are protesting the use...

1238
