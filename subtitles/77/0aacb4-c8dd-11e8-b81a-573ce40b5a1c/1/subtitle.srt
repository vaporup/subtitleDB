00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:45,934
Sell your daughter
if you can't pay.

"DEBT"

16
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,701
Take her away.

17
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:52,143
Don't!

18
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:53,618
Go!

19
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:48,416
You're free now.
Go.

20
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,134
Fai Yuk-Su... Stand up.

21
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:59,532
That slap was a
present from Lincoln.

22
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,416
And this is from Shakespeare!

23
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:08,660
We're discussing famous quotations.
And what are you doing?

24
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,179
Drawing cartoons.

25
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:16,332
"Windblown Grass"? "Cloudy Skies"?
"Seeking A Failure Strategy"?

26
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,376
Can you afford to fail?

27
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,535
You think you're a genius
so you don't have to study.

28
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,942
Mozart was a genius. At six years old,
he performed in front of the emperor.

29
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,621
But you?

30
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,260
You're so slow!

31
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,903
You! Next time I catch you
doing this, I'll expel you.

32
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:48,300
Give them back!

33
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:50,175
Hey,
give them back.

34
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:54,742
- Give me back my drawings.
- Here you go.

35
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,778
I don't even know what you drew.
Only one fist and one foot?

36
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:04,578
A comic book is supposed to be
like this, crazy!

37
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:07,496
Wow, great.

38
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:10,456
Fantastic.
Really great.

39
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:15,172
Yeah? I think he's going to kill me.
I made him so angry.

40
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:19,303
No. I mean the whirlwind kick you
drew. Nothing could beat that.

41
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,813
No more bullying the weak!

42
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:24,218
Catch!

43
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,621
I've warned you before
about using the basketball court.

44
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,859
You know the school team
needs to practise,

45
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,782
but you're still using our space.
Haven't you been beaten enough?

46
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,974
You're just a bully!

47
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,617
Get off.

48
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,496
Come on.

49
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:59,183
If we don't leave now,
we're going to die.

50
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:00,577
Let's go!

51
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,295
Stop! Stop!

52
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,453
Master, come home now
or your father will scold me.

53
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:10,054
You go on ahead. Don't follow me.
Go home.

54
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:14,894
I asked Mui to make you soup.
If it gets cold it won't taste as good.

55
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:17,379
Please come home
and do your homework.

56
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:24,332
- Why do you still keep a maid?
- I discussed it with my dad.

57
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,533
He says it's inappropriate for
a gentleman not to have one.

58
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:28,654
You have her follow you all day.

59
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,819
- Don't you have a conscience?
- No, you're wrong.

60
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:34,492
Even though she's my maid,
she's more of a nag than my mother.

61
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:37,942
- Go and do your homework.
- Okay.

62
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:41,019
- Dad, I'm home from school.
- Uncle.

63
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:44,376
Yuk-Su. You didn't burn incense
for your late mother.

64
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,336
- I'll go and do it now.
- You're so forgetful!

65
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:49,898
What happened to you?
Been in a fight again?

66
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,982
You've got a black eye.
If your father...

67
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:01,339
- You can rinse now.
- Thanks, Uncle.

68
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,183
Yuk-Su, bring water
to wash his hair.

69
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,295
Won't be a minute...

70
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:09,096
Uncle Chai,
I'll do it myself.

71
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,979
What are you up to?

72
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,095
You...
Fai Yuk-Su!

73
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:17,815
You bad boy.
Had another fight?

74
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:20,219
- You should be studying!
- Uncle...

75
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:21,697
It wasn't his fault.

76
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:24,940
I was being bullied.
He stood up for me.

77
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,737
If you don't get in
to medical school,

78
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:30,822
your dear mother
will turn in her grave.

79
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,332
Does it hurt?

80
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:34,455
- It's okay.
- Let me see.

81
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,495
You call that okay?!

82
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,220
- Master, so you are here!
- Put on my blazer.

83
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:50,416
Are you giving it to him?
Your father will be angry with me...

84
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:52,420
Mind your own business!

85
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:57,299
Master, please come home now.
Your father will hit me if you don't.

86
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,094
Come on,
please.

87
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,340
Yuk-Su, I'm off.
See you, Uncle.

88
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,375
- Take this off first.
- Come on.

89
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:07,336
Let me wipe the hair off your clothes.
Wait for me!

90
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,212
- You two want to earn extra cash?
- Yes.

91
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:13,140
It's getting dark.
Quickly, follow me.

92
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:14,219
Okay.

93
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,863
Inspector Wa, today we'll be
working on your diction.

94
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:25,134
Repeat after me.
Listen:

95
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:41,461
And again...

96
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,779
- Trying to kill me?
- Inspector Wa.

97
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:56,014
Are you all right?

98
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:59,938
Little bitch. You do this every time!
No food for you.

99
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,782
- It won't happen again.
- No food for three days.

100
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:05,292
What have you done again?

101
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:10,501
Hey, move on,
you.

102
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,051
What are you doing?

103
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,095
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,380
Apologies.

105
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,377
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:37,301
Hey, Siu-Yu, you haven't poured
the Master's tea yet.

107
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:39,617
Coming.

108
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:56,898
Inspector Wa,
this is for you.

109
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:01,493
The Sandakan matter
has not been settled yet, has it?

110
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,295
What do you think?

111
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,254
It's not settled?

112
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:05,577
No.

113
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:12,214
Master,
your Ginseng tea.

114
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,135
Your tea, sir.

115
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,175
Out!

116
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:39,257
You've been keeping
that one from me.

117
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,135
You like her?

118
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,538
Tin, give her to
Mr Wong tomorrow.

119
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,895
Good evening, Mr Sandakan.
This way, please.

120
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:59,621
Inspector Wa's been
waiting for you a long time.

121
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,982
Please come in.
Merry Christmas.

122
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:12,455
Merry Christmas.

123
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:17,091
A local gift for you.

124
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:24,019
Mmm...
how fragrant.

125
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:40,733
Are you scared?
Done something wrong?

126
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:45,899
This gun is very old
but won't misfire.

127
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:49,903
This is especially for you.
Here's to working well together.

128
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:53,538
But if I see this bastard again,
I won't be so polite.

129
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:56,942
I asked for 40 girls from you
in our last deal

130
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,339
and only 20 showed up on board.

131
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:02,694
That's not possible. The paperwork
showed 40 fingerprints.

132
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,099
We even watched them embark.

133
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,541
Perhaps that bastard
stole them from me.

134
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,256
You stole them?

135
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:15,013
You come to me
because you lost some goods?

136
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:18,375
Would you come to me
if you lost your wife?

137
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,862
Scum!

138
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:33,698
Why are you being
so rude to my dad?

139
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,815
I don't need my hands. One kick
and I'll tear your head off.

140
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:54,698
You touch one hair on my father's
head, you'll pay with one of your legs.

141
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,301
Very good.
Very good.

142
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:03,532
- Men!
- Yes?

143
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:04,739
Take them outside.

144
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:18,214
Good!
Come with me.

145
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:24,818
You've got to leave. Your master's
going to give you away to Mr Wong.

146
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:26,696
Go on home.

147
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,501
Hey,
where are you going?

148
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,296
Believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.

149
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:34,983
- Let go of me.
- Siu-Yu! Siu-Yu!

150
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,537
Coming,
coming...

151
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:38,742
Ah, Siu-Yu! Come,
come, come...

152
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,214
You don't have to work any more.
Pack your things.

153
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,335
Tomorrow we're sending you
to Mr Wong.

154
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,179
What for?

155
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:46,340
To enjoy the good life.

156
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:47,862
How's about a kiss?

157
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:49,652
Come on...

158
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,855
Come on!

159
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:00,618
Quickly!

160
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,616
Stop them!
They're getting away.

161
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:06,903
Hurry up so you can catch them!

162
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,697
Where are they?

163
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:11,462
They're there!
They're there!

164
00:16:13,743 --> 00:16:15,256
It's them!

165
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:17,973
Stop! Stop!

166
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:24,697
Want to elope?

167
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:30,135
- Yuk-Su, what are you doing here?
- Huh?

168
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:31,379
Little punk!

169
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,134
Hey, guys...
Hey, hey...

170
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:36,983
- Headmaster, you know him?
- He's one of my students.

171
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,822
- What's going on?
- He tried to steal our maid.

172
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:43,618
- And he's one of his students.
- From now on, he's expelled.

173
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:47,458
Yuk-Su! Yuk-Su!
Why are you beating my son?

174
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:50,818
That's enough.
He's the headmaster's student.

175
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:54,541
Don't stop on my behalf. Our school
doesn't have students like this.

176
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:59,260
Fai Yuk-Su, as from tomorrow,
do not come back to school.

177
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,533
You've insulted our school.

178
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:04,019
Headmaster.
Give him a chance?

179
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,179
It's okay.
Siu-Yu can't have gone far.

180
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:08,499
Get her back.
And let them go.

181
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:11,983
- Give him a chance. Please.
- Go! Go!

182
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,776
- Headmaster!
- Go! Go!

183
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:23,895
Father.

184
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:28,573
Let's go!

185
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,857
Follow them!

186
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:39,733
Father,
I'll carry you.

187
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:50,814
- Help!
- Use strength! Use strength!

188
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:56,095
Help! Help!
Please open the gate!

189
00:17:56,344 --> 00:18:00,416
Quickly, open the gate!
Help! Help!

190
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:04,496
People are chasing us.

191
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,613
I'm going in to get them.

192
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:13,183
- You want in? We can't allow that.
- Don't stand in our way.

193
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,215
Let's rush them!

194
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,817
They ran inside,
but they won't let us pass.

195
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:44,095
Don't move!

196
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,899
Hey, stop, stop.

197
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:51,140
Oh, it's you,
Soh-Bo (SILL Y).

198
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:53,823
My teacher's name is Jean-Paul,
not Soh-Bo.

199
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,902
A misunderstanding.
You know how my English is.

200
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,492
A terrible misunderstanding,
but then...

201
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,898
I'm trying to apprehend
two fugitives.

202
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:03,979
Did you see them
enter your place?

203
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:07,062
- They definitely went in.
- I saw them go in.

204
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:11,621
No-one's been in here but us.

205
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,063
Move aside.

206
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,777
Move aside!

207
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,983
- If you don't believe me, go search.
- Damn!

208
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:31,493
If you say no-one's gone in there,
how can I not believe you?

209
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,933
Okay. If you do see them,
please notify me.

210
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:35,903
Let's go!

211
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:51,332
- It's all right now. Don't be afraid.
- Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:53,613
- Thank you for saving our lives.
- Not at all.

213
00:20:57,184 --> 00:20:59,175
- Father.
- Bring medicine.

214
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:03,982
- Did those creeps beat you up?
- Yes, sir.

215
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:05,855
Help him up.

216
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:24,979
She fell in herself.
It wasn't me.

217
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,211
Hey!

218
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,379
What are you doing here?
Why haven't you gone home?

219
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:35,497
Master, my home is in Dong Guan.
Let me follow you. I'll be your maid.

220
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,295
Father.

221
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:59,778
Good deeds are not done
when you want to do them.

222
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:05,183
There is a time
and there is a place.

223
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:10,377
The poor can't fight the rich and
the rich can't fight the government.

224
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:16,501
You believe
you've helped this girl.

225
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:20,582
In fact,
your help has made it worse for her.

226
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:26,702
Master,
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

227
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:32,100
I'd better... I'd better
just go back to Master Wa.

228
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:37,334
I can't allow you to be fed to the lions
and not do anything.

229
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:40,615
It's too dangerous
to let you go right now.

230
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:45,180
Where does Mr. Faat live?
Take these kids away!

231
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:47,023
I don't know!

232
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,662
I'm going to smack you!
Where does Mr Faat live?

233
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,059
- You're hurting me!
- Do you know or not?

234
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,252
Let me go!

235
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:56,022
- Let's leave!
- Where can you go?

236
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:58,862
I have a friend
you can stay with for now.

237
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:03,537
"NO.1 BEEF NOODLES"

238
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:05,894
So that's what happened.

239
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,617
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I really am.

240
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,700
That's all right.

241
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,499
In today's world
people have to help each other.

242
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:17,616
Don't worry. Stay here for now.
Wait till your leg's healed.

243
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:21,782
If your son has no school to go to,
he can help out around here.

244
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,134
- Thank you so much.
- That's okay.

245
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,818
- Master, time to get up.
- Don't bother me.

246
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:31,697
- Hey!
- Don't bother me.

247
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,295
Give them back.

248
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:45,013
- What?
- Master, your father says to get up.

249
00:23:45,983 --> 00:23:47,974
What did you call me?

250
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,219
Master?

251
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,903
Master?!

252
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,816
Master!

253
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:56,700
What are you doing?

254
00:23:56,823 --> 00:23:59,179
Dr Sun Yat-Sen wants equality,
so no pigtails.

255
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:04,095
I don't want there to be servants
and masters in the world.

256
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,340
"Master"?!
"Master"!

257
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:09,058
Why do you believe
you're lower than anybody else?

258
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,139
I won't next time,
Mast...

259
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,978
- What do I call you?
- Yuk-Su.

260
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:18,015
Master Yuk-Su?

261
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,219
It's Yuk-Su.
Not Master Yuk-Su.

262
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,573
Do you understand?

263
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,581
- Yuk-Su?
- That's it.

264
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:29,501
- I'll get you water to wash your face.
- Okay.

265
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,383
Hey!

266
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:36,535
She loves to serve!

267
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:39,974
Honourable Sir, I've decided
you're my teacher. I'll be just like you.

268
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:44,381
You'll teach me kung fu so I can help
the weak and serve the people.

269
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:47,256
- What are you saying?
- Father!

270
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:51,423
Go and help Master Yat. Remember
to burn incense for your late mother.

271
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:52,374
Okay.

272
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:04,334
- Good morning, Master Yat.
- Morning. So, you've been expelled?

273
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,573
That's true.
No more school.

274
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:11,415
Uncle Wing told me all about it.

275
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:15,696
If you've really been expelled,
stay here and help me cook.

276
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:18,462
Start by collecting
the water from over the hill.

277
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:24,420
It's so heavy!

278
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:35,019
Let me do it for you.
I'm used to this kind of heavy work.

279
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:38,251
Okay. I'll let you help me.
I'm going out.

280
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:41,103
- Hey, where are you going?
- To J.P.'s place.

281
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:43,943
- "J" what?
- J.P.'s place. You don't know him.

282
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:47,260
That big French guy
that helped us last night.

283
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,658
- Are you sure you can?
- Why not?

284
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,251
- Because I'll get into trouble.
- Look...

285
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,979
Say nothing and no-one will know.
Get the water, then hide the bucket.

286
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:59,175
And if anybody asks you where I am,
what do you say?

287
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,977
You say I've gone
to get the water.

288
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,855
I'm gone.

289
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:10,136
"Ba..."?
What "Ba"?

290
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:19,260
Students, the lesson that I want to
teach you today is...

291
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:22,261
...the relationship between muscle
and strength. Now...

292
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:24,295
This is called muscle.

293
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:27,292
What's this muscle called?

294
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:28,937
- The "Mouse".
- Yeah, the "Mouse".

295
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:31,255
Wrong.

296
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:35,296
It's called a "bicep".
Bicep.

297
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:41,813
What's going on?
What's happening?

298
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:46,492
- You again?
- Yeah, Honourable French Man.

299
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:50,502
I really look up to you.
Take me as a student.

300
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:54,694
I've only 2 dollars.
Take it as a deposit.

301
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,417
That's not enough.
It won't do.

302
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:01,059
These students paid 100 dollars.
And you pay only 2 dollars?

303
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,300
It's not fair to them,
is it?

304
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,733
I'll pay my way
to make up for it.

305
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:09,697
I can wash towels.
I'll mop the floor. Anything.

306
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:11,576
Take me in.

307
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:15,264
I'll take you in
so you can work as you study.

308
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,933
- You're in. Okay?
- Thank you, Honourable Sir.

309
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,573
Oh, yes.
Take this first.

310
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,898
Now, students,
you know about the biceps.

311
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,776
Yes.

312
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:32,054
Hey, come here.

313
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:41,381
Students, these two
are quite similar in size, right?

314
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:42,572
Right.

315
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:47,618
But do you know their respective
muscles are quite different.

316
00:27:47,743 --> 00:27:49,859
- What's the difference, Sir?
- Look.

317
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:53,737
This here is the
abdominal muscle.

318
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:58,982
Now,
this is blubber.

319
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:02,734
Fat and flabby.
Soft as blubber.

320
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,616
These are fat cells.

321
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:18,662
- He's got no strength!
- That's it?

322
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:28,455
Are you okay?

323
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,380
Students...

324
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,813
This is muscle against fat.

325
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:41,140
When faced with strength,
the most obvious difference is...

326
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,502
Strength!
It's very important!

327
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:48,017
If I can pack 500lb
in one punch...

328
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:52,660
- Bravo!
- That's great!

329
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:54,496
Students.

330
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:59,014
If each of you can pack 100lb
and punch five times,

331
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:02,500
that's 100 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1
and once more,

332
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:05,091
- how much is that?
- 100.

333
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:08,693
Right. So my 500lb punch
can beat all of you.

334
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:12,577
One punch of yours, even five
punches, may not knock me down.

335
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:16,541
So how can we get you to do
a 500lb punch?

336
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:21,215
One or two muscles won't do it.
You have to use all your muscles.

337
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:40,982
Wow!
That's great!

338
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:50,059
The Chinese are called the sick men
of East Asia. Why?

339
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:56,292
Bad nutrition. Eating rice every day
which bloats the belly.

340
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:59,733
If you don't eat enough meat,
of course you're under-nourished.

341
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:03,459
You look at those foreigners.
They're all huge.

342
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:06,656
And the reason is,
with every meal they eat meat.

343
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:11,140
So, if you want to have good nutrition,
you must eat meat.

344
00:30:18,144 --> 00:30:23,059
Also. The Chinese overcook
vegetables and lose all the vitamins.

345
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:24,935
Look what the foreigners eat.

346
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:31,142
- What is it?
- Salad?

347
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:57,782
- Yuk-Su, have you finished?
- Yeah. These are the last buckets.

348
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,943
Must have been hard for you,
working night and day.

349
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:06,023
- Hard work never killed anyone.
- You've fetched buckets all day.

350
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:08,214
How many do you think you did?

351
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,499
Huh?

352
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:11,376
How many?

353
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:16,336
- Maybe eight to ten.
- So that's one every hour.

354
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,019
No, no.
30 buckets.

355
00:31:20,943 --> 00:31:22,662
30 buckets?

356
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:26,174
One bucket every 20 minutes.
That was quick!

357
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:30,654
Hey, tank...

358
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,536
Are you having me on?

359
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:35,862
Ordinarily you hold
eight to ten buckets.

360
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:39,943
Now someone's here,
you hold 30 to 40?

361
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:43,180
- Are you elastic?
- There's no need to berate me.

362
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:47,741
Today I went out to help a friend.
He was being bullied.

363
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:51,220
Yesterday you saved a maid
and today you helped a friend.

364
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,733
- You're a good lad.
- That's right.

365
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:56,935
To fight injustice and save people
is my goal in life.

366
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:59,019
- I really admire that.
- Thanks.

367
00:31:59,144 --> 00:32:03,023
- Master Yat, it's dinner time.
- Let's go and eat, then.

368
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:08,464
Yuk-Su, what does
your friend look like?

369
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:12,622
Really fat, he's got small eyes,
a snout of a nose and talks a lot.

370
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:14,496
Fatty Hing is really fat,
huh?

371
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:18,291
- Father.
- Where have you been?

372
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:20,175
I've just explained
to Master Yat.

373
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:23,261
How Fatty Hing was being bullied
and I had to help him.

374
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,260
That's why I'm so late.

375
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:29,581
- Fatty Hing. When did you get here?
- Half a day ago.

376
00:32:29,703 --> 00:32:31,660
Here's your meal.

377
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,781
Just look at yourself.
If you don't start behaving,

378
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:38,542
how are you going to
face your late mother?

379
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:41,178
Yuk-Su,
I'm going now.

380
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:43,818
About your drawings.
I'll get them tomorrow.

381
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:46,777
Goodbye, Uncle. Goodbye, Master
Yat. Goodbye, Uncle Lofty.

382
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:48,416
Hey,
not so fast.

383
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:52,662
- Stay for dinner. We've got enough.
- No, thanks. I'd better go home.

384
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:56,782
- Let's eat.
- Go on, eat.

385
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:59,054
- Father, let's eat.
- Wait.

386
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:02,415
Didn't Uncle Chai just say hard
workers have food to eat

387
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:04,261
and lazy people
will have nothing?

388
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:07,615
Right? I think you're already full,
so you'd better not have any more.

389
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:09,859
You'll mess up your stomach.

390
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:14,135
Why not do some exercise instead?
You can grind some rice for me.

391
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,662
Go on.

392
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:25,421
Who wants to eat? What's the point
of eating rice anyway?

393
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:40,093
Why should I be grinding rice?
I want to be a hero!

394
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:44,261
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

395
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:47,295
Eat your dinner.
I'll grind the rice.

396
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:53,460
Do you really like being a slave?
You're already free.

397
00:33:56,424 --> 00:33:58,415
No need to be so grouchy.

398
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:02,423
You think you've got it tough?
There are people worse off than you.

399
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:07,617
You've never had it hard. Anyway,
you have a father and a best friend.

400
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:11,293
It's different for me.

401
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,461
When I was young,
I was sold off as a maid.

402
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:18,974
I don't even know
if my mother's alive.

403
00:34:19,344 --> 00:34:22,017
Why were you sold off?

404
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,820
I lived in Dong Guan.

405
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:32,620
My father was a tenant farmer.

406
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,059
The crops kept on failing.

407
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:40,459
At first, we were able
to have two meals a day.

408
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:47,617
But my father got sick and died.
Mum sold me to pay for the funeral.

409
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:50,776
Once sold...

410
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:53,938
I had to work for eight years.

411
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:58,139
Don't cry.

412
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,379
Let me help you wipe your tears.

413
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:15,014
I'll help you with the rice.

414
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:18,340
It's dawn.

415
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:35,898
"It's the first suggestion of dawn,
Darkness still prevails"

416
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:40,298
"One tankful of water,
two people"

417
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:46,937
"Tolling away,
keeping ourselves strong"

418
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:51,615
"This long road
is getting shorter"

419
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:57,784
"Brimming with water,
the jars are full"

420
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:01,977
"Heart filled with
feelings of love"

421
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:08,378
"When you walk ahead,
I'll walk where you walk"

422
00:36:08,744 --> 00:36:13,056
"Working together in harmony"

423
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:19,537
"When your heart is filled with sweetness,
so is mine"

424
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:24,054
"May the water be our witness"

425
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,776
Finished.

426
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:31,418
I'll get some water.
You take a rest.

427
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:34,104
I don't want to sleep.
I was wrong yesterday.

428
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:36,101
I'll do all my chores first.

429
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,581
"Fetching water,
romantic love still ongoing..."

430
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:41,614
Let me give you a hand...

431
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:44,338
"Facing a prisoner's fate
because of my feelings"

432
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:47,137
No, that's okay.
You'd better stay here.

433
00:36:48,344 --> 00:36:50,938
Wait for me.
I want to help you.

434
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,299
Hey!

435
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:56,211
"...it turned out to be your kiss"

436
00:36:57,744 --> 00:37:02,659
"Brimming with water,
connecting together"

437
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:07,063
"Heart filled with
feelings of love"

438
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:12,498
Now, as you can't read,
I'll read it once for you.

439
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:15,538
"In consideration of
the loan to my father,

440
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:18,781
and the fact that the loan of 20 Yuan
is unable to be paid,

441
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,978
I, Cheung A-Choi, agree to be sold
to the house of Yi-Hung as a maid,

442
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:31,016
without salary or benefits of any kind,
to work for no less than 20 years."

443
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:34,500
"This agreement is binding and I have
no recourse against said agreement,

444
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:37,138
which is also a
transferable document

445
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:41,416
which allows me to be bought and
sold at a price agreed by my master."

446
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:46,179
- Daddy!
- Behave!

447
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:47,817
Get to work!
Leave!

448
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,423
Greetings,
Inspector!

449
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:50,818
- Dad!
- Get to work!

450
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:52,501
Let's go!
Let's go!

451
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,419
There's plenty more
where that came from.

452
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:59,744
You haven't found that maid yet,
have you?

453
00:37:59,864 --> 00:38:03,652
What have you been doing?
Send your men out to find her.

454
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,979
Don't worry.
She won't get away.

455
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,583
TRUE SWORD,
I BESEECH YOU...

456
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,773
- Get up.
- Just a little longer.

457
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:18,134
- No more sleeping!
- You little punk!

458
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:19,458
Don't! Don't!

459
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,900
It's eight o'clock.

460
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:24,254
- Come with me.
- You're useless.

461
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:30,295
I spent the night grinding rice.
I even fetched the water.

462
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:33,063
- What's wrong with sleeping a bit?
- You think you're overworked?

463
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:35,220
You think I'm mistreating you?

464
00:38:35,344 --> 00:38:38,620
The work you did
you should have done yesterday -

465
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:40,655
never mind your
chores for today.

466
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:49,500
Wash the wok like I do.

467
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:57,420
- That's too hot.
- No, you're just too slow.

468
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,500
Do it faster.

469
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:07,215
That's better.
It's not dirty. Why clean it?

470
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,098
- Not dirty? Take a look.
- You're right.

471
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,022
- It's so dirty.
- Rub the stains harder.

472
00:39:19,144 --> 00:39:21,782
If you don't,
we'll end up with black noodles.

473
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,821
Hey, you'll break up
all the noodles doing that.

474
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:43,903
- Then how should I do it?
- Noodles can't be turned. Toss them.

475
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,693
Toss! Toss!
Toss!

476
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,775
I toss!

477
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:41,540
- I succeeded!
- Add salt.

478
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:45,782
Add sauce...
that's it. See?

479
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:52,174
Wow! It smells great.
I'll take it out for them.

480
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:55,900
- Tell us which is better.
- Who cooked which?

481
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:59,935
I can't say.
You have to decide for yourselves.

482
00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:02,897
You just try it.
He can't be better than the master.

483
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:03,854
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,302
Come on,
let's eat.

485
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:09,217
Let's taste before discussing.

486
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,494
- Come, come.
- Master Yat! Uncle Chai!

487
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:12,534
Wow!

488
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:17,053
Mmm... beef noodles.
Why didn't you wait for me?

489
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:20,894
Wow! Great stuff. Noodles.
Let me have a taste.

490
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:23,659
This one's fu yung noodles.

491
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:27,140
I wonder what this is.
Let me try it.

492
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:30,657
Well?

493
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:33,778
Master Yat,
you're really good!

494
00:41:33,903 --> 00:41:36,737
Every time you cook something,
it's unique.

495
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:39,378
But this time it
tastes a bit weird.

496
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:42,535
But it's true.

497
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:48,175
- It does grow on you, though.
- Eat it all, then.

498
00:41:49,664 --> 00:41:53,862
Fine. If I eat it all, I'll get fat.
So let's share it.

499
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:55,974
You... you...
get fat by yourself.

500
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:59,176
We'll eat Master Yat's
fu... fu... fu yung noodles.

501
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:00,498
Come,
let's eat.

502
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,615
It's obvious to you all.

503
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:04,700
I'm not good enough yet.

504
00:42:05,463 --> 00:42:07,215
Yuk-Su.

505
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:11,932
Let me put in a fair word.
I tasted both dishes in the kitchen.

506
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:16,103
Yes, Master Yat's dish is better.
But Yuk-Su's isn't bad.

507
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:19,499
It tastes funny, but it's good.
Granddad, have some.

508
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:22,581
- Try some?
- Yeah, let's have a taste.

509
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:27,656
The flavour's been sealed well.
I can tell from the oil colour.

510
00:42:27,784 --> 00:42:30,661
There's a man in Guangzhou City
who makes seven-colour noodles.

511
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:31,899
- Really?
- Yeah.

512
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,581
And I'm going to check him out.

513
00:42:33,704 --> 00:42:36,376
Yuk-Su,
hold the fort while I'm gone.

514
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:37,619
Me?
I can't do that.

515
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:42,259
- Just stay calm.
- Yuk-Su, try your best then.

516
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:46,456
He's put all his trust in you.
You'd better thank him.

517
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:49,382
- Thank you, Master.
- That's all right.

518
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:52,540
- Time for a drink, right?
- Yes!

519
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:55,696
Let's fill the glasses.

520
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:01,220
Want a ride?

521
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:04,695
Now, do your best
to look after the business.

522
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:06,542
I understand,
Master.

523
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:10,857
Have a good trip.

524
00:43:16,504 --> 00:43:18,335
It's here!
It's here!

525
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:21,535
- It smells so good!
- It's unbeatable!

526
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:25,942
- Let's have a taste!
- It's so tasty!

527
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:34,179
Siu-Yu, I've prepared
more than 30 plates here.

528
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:37,536
Now...

529
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,655
You heat them up in here

530
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,856
and if there's not enough
you split them into two.

531
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,942
I can't.
I'll get into trouble for that.

532
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:50,782
If father hadn't got hurt
we wouldn't be here.

533
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:55,018
Frankly, I, Fai Yuk-Su,
am not meant to cook noodles.

534
00:43:55,143 --> 00:43:59,023
I've got to go and learn
kung fu so I can help the weak.

535
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:01,738
That's what I really want to do.

536
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:05,492
- I know. You're a free man.
- I'm glad you understand.

537
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:07,182
I'm off.

538
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:20,060
Hit it higher.
Now watch me.

539
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,579
Get up.

540
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:36,423
And where have you been?
Here for a day then gone for a month.

541
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:39,854
Sir, even though I wasn't here,
I've been practising kung fu.

542
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:42,703
Based on what you taught me
on the first day,

543
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:47,614
I've been pushing myself. I haven't
forgotten a single thing you've said.

544
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:48,937
I'll try you out.

545
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:50,497
- Ricky!
- Yes?

546
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,023
- A demonstration.
- Okay.

547
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:54,293
- Come! Come!
- Let's get a good seat!

548
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:55,572
I wonder who'll win?

549
00:44:55,704 --> 00:44:57,137
Go on.

550
00:45:03,664 --> 00:45:04,937
- Great!
- Bravo!

551
00:45:05,624 --> 00:45:08,501
- That was great!
- Back to practise! Practise!

552
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:10,057
He's completely different!

553
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:14,302
Sir, I really remembered all you said.
I ate raw meat at every meal.

554
00:45:14,424 --> 00:45:17,700
Hey, let's see how many pounds
you can hit now.

555
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,056
200lb.

556
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:25,539
That was good!

557
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:31,501
Don't throw wild punches!

558
00:45:31,624 --> 00:45:33,933
Not like that.
Aim well.

559
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,418
If you're too impulsive,
you waste energy.

560
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:38,295
Come on.

561
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,293
Don't duck.

562
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:44,176
Let it hit you.

563
00:45:44,303 --> 00:45:48,297
You've got to be able to take it.
Watch it carefully. Go with the flow.

564
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:49,979
Hit hard!

565
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:51,536
You're stronger than it.

566
00:45:51,704 --> 00:45:52,932
Now, come on.

567
00:45:56,864 --> 00:46:00,254
"You think I'll feel pain,
you think I'll be tired"

568
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:04,138
"How to hate,
how to practise."

569
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:08,142
"How to love,
how to say goodbye"

570
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:12,097
"Using hands and
feet to be healthy"

571
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,933
"With a dream I fight reality"

572
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:19,541
"I'm already very,
very exhausted"

573
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:23,339
"Dreaming about how
to hold up the sky"

574
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:26,342
"I can only focus and go forward"

575
00:46:26,903 --> 00:46:34,299
"Strong body, so as to be forthright
and strike one more time"

576
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:41,374
"Strong heart, it's for each fight
that you need to be replenished"

577
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:48,218
"A youth, with strong body and mind
that will never change"

578
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:55,413
"Rushing ahead,
within reality you challenge yourself"

579
00:46:55,543 --> 00:47:01,937
"A youth, with strong body and mind
that will never change"

580
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:09,896
"Rushing ahead,
within reality you challenge yourself"

581
00:47:10,024 --> 00:47:11,980
I can be a hero now!

582
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:19,731
Quickly...
quickly!

583
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:22,219
Sister!
Give me back my sister.

584
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:24,539
Be quiet!
Want to riot?

585
00:47:25,784 --> 00:47:27,979
It's good that you've come here.

586
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:32,383
Keep quiet.

587
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:33,659
What is it?

588
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,854
Inspector Wa,
I've come to buy back my sister.

589
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,817
We sold her to them
to work as a maid, not a whore.

590
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:41,981
- I have the contract.
- Can't you read?

591
00:47:44,143 --> 00:47:47,978
"As a slave or a prostitute."
That's what it says.

592
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:52,179
I don't care.
He said she'd be a maid.

593
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:57,378
Being a whore's much better.
It's not as tough as being a maid.

594
00:47:57,504 --> 00:47:59,812
He should try being a whore!

595
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:02,094
Here's the money.
I want her back.

596
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:04,692
I've had someone
calculate it for me.

597
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:08,976
For two years that's 27.30.
The principal and interest is all here.

598
00:48:09,104 --> 00:48:12,016
Means 2 dollars a day.

599
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:15,853
And that works out
to be 1, 460 dollars.

600
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:17,656
Do you have that much money?

601
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:19,695
Leave!

602
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:26,461
This contract is legal.
If you don't leave I'll arrest you all.

603
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:27,777
Go!

604
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:32,294
Inspector, arrest them all
for trespassing. Quickly!

605
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:34,938
- Give me back my sister!
- Arrest them all!

606
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:36,577
Master Wong!
Master Wong!

607
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:41,215
Master Wong, give her back.
I beg you.

608
00:48:44,264 --> 00:48:45,776
Evil bastard.

609
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:50,976
Sonny!

610
00:48:57,264 --> 00:48:58,776
Father?

611
00:49:21,664 --> 00:49:24,894
Whoever touches one hair on
my father's head pays with a leg.

612
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:26,581
Let's go now!

613
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,857
Let's go!

614
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:30,577
Go! Go!

615
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:32,455
Out! Go!

616
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:01,657
- What?
- Piss off.

617
00:50:02,463 --> 00:50:03,499
Let me go!

618
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:05,703
It's not her!

619
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:07,382
Piss off!

620
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:10,659
Waiter,
what's taking so long?

621
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:11,773
Hurry up!

622
00:50:11,903 --> 00:50:16,579
All right, all right.
Just a minute, the rest is coming.

623
00:50:18,344 --> 00:50:20,539
What's going on here?

624
00:50:20,664 --> 00:50:23,542
There's too many people
and we can't cook fast enough.

625
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:28,774
I'll go and take a look.

626
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:31,543
What's taking so long?
It's still not here.

627
00:50:31,944 --> 00:50:34,060
What are you doing?

628
00:50:34,184 --> 00:50:35,936
Who is your boss?

629
00:50:36,223 --> 00:50:37,577
I belong to Mr Chan.

630
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,183
Go to hell!

631
00:50:39,784 --> 00:50:41,342
Where's Yuk-Su?

632
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:43,379
Huh?

633
00:50:43,664 --> 00:50:46,497
- Where is Yuk-Su?
- Oh, he's...

634
00:50:47,664 --> 00:50:49,382
Where's he got to?

635
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:53,543
- That little punk!
- It's not ready. You must add sauce.

636
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,062
Okay.

637
00:50:55,824 --> 00:50:57,701
It'll do.
Quick!

638
00:50:57,824 --> 00:50:59,815
Beef noodles are here!

639
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:04,222
- That's disgusting! How's yours?
- It's horrible.

640
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:06,660
Shorty,
come here.

641
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:09,981
What? My name's Lofty.
Not Shorty.

642
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:15,982
- Shorty, eat it.
- Eat! Eat!

643
00:51:17,504 --> 00:51:19,858
What was that for?

644
00:51:22,184 --> 00:51:24,981
- What are you doing?
- Tell your boss to come out.

645
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:27,538
My... my... boss has gone
to Guangzhou.

646
00:51:27,824 --> 00:51:30,053
Oh, no.
Mr Wong's men.

647
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:33,220
Tell Yat to come out!

648
00:51:33,344 --> 00:51:33,935
Let's go.

649
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,693
- It's like sticky goo.
- How can they serve this stuff?

650
00:51:53,824 --> 00:51:54,892
Let's go.

651
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:09,818
Siu-Yu. Come on out,
quickly.

652
00:52:23,864 --> 00:52:24,899
Stop!

653
00:52:27,824 --> 00:52:30,178
Mister, what did we do
that made you tear down the sign?

654
00:52:30,303 --> 00:52:32,943
What's it to you? Get lost.
Who are you?

655
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:35,179
Well,
I'm the boss here.

656
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:37,259
The boss?

657
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:43,499
"No.1 Beef noodles"?
More like the worst.

658
00:52:44,463 --> 00:52:46,182
Calm down,
mister.

659
00:52:46,303 --> 00:52:49,454
I opened this shop
to make a living.

660
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,858
Smash the board
and we'll be out of business.

661
00:52:51,983 --> 00:52:53,656
What is this?

662
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:56,139
- They're beef noodles.
- Beef noodles?

663
00:52:56,264 --> 00:52:58,619
- Yes.
- It's manure.

664
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,619
Maybe this one's not good.
I'll go and make you some more.

665
00:53:04,744 --> 00:53:06,700
Stay right there.

666
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:09,657
- I make good ones.
- You said "good", huh?

667
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:10,819
Yes.

668
00:53:10,944 --> 00:53:13,060
So eat it all.

669
00:53:13,184 --> 00:53:14,378
Eat it.

670
00:53:20,584 --> 00:53:23,097
Lick it off the floor.

671
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:43,337
You don't have the right to say
you're number one.

672
00:53:44,584 --> 00:53:48,372
You are a dog so
crawl like a dog.

673
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,459
Crawl.

674
00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:14,133
- Lofty, clean this up.
- Yes.

675
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:50,580
Hey, Siu-Yu.
Doesn't that look great?

676
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:55,299
What happened?

677
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:57,176
What's the matter?

678
00:55:58,704 --> 00:56:02,253
Father, I told you not to work.
What about your leg?

679
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,583
You little punk!
I'll kill you!

680
00:56:07,704 --> 00:56:09,774
You're useless.
I'll kill you.

681
00:56:10,824 --> 00:56:14,578
- Don't hit him.
- Don't try to stop me. I'll kill him.

682
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,093
- Why are you hitting me?
- How can you face your Uncle?

683
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:20,978
Uncle Chai! Uncle Chai!
Calm down. It wasn't his fault.

684
00:56:21,104 --> 00:56:23,060
Will you listen to me?

685
00:56:24,344 --> 00:56:28,815
- Master Yat, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be like this. Get up.

686
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:43,695
Your poor mother.
She'd turn in her grave.

687
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,815
He doesn't know himself.

688
00:57:01,944 --> 00:57:05,856
He's unfit and weak,
yet he's always picking fights

689
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:08,657
and even wants to be a hero.

690
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:12,054
The poor
can't fight the rich

691
00:57:12,184 --> 00:57:14,539
and the rich
can't fight the government.

692
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:19,819
I work my guts out
to get him into the very best school

693
00:57:19,944 --> 00:57:24,016
just so he'll be able to
rise above all this

694
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:26,658
and become a good
medical student.

695
00:57:26,784 --> 00:57:28,580
And now it's all over.

696
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:32,856
It's lucky you took him in, but he
can't even learn to cook noodles

697
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:35,338
and now he's brought you
all this trouble.

698
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:38,695
- I'm so very sorry.
- Don't be like that.

699
00:57:38,824 --> 00:57:42,373
As soon as everything's cleared up
we can start again.

700
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:45,541
If Yuk-Su doesn't like cooking
he can always continue drawing.

701
00:57:45,664 --> 00:57:48,337
Everybody's good at something,
you know.

702
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:51,811
He actually can draw well.

703
00:57:53,584 --> 00:57:55,016
Drawing?

704
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:02,900
What good is drawing?
When I was 20,

705
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:05,458
I won an award at
the Salone in Paris.

706
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:08,014
You have a great talent.

707
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:13,021
What good was this talent
when my wife starved to death?

708
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:17,335
That was just money problems.

709
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,621
What's so good
about drawing well?

710
00:58:19,744 --> 00:58:23,942
When I was in Beijing,
I was so poor I had to sell my quilt.

711
00:58:24,063 --> 00:58:28,295
And when my wife was in labour,
I couldn't send her to the hospital.

712
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:33,019
As a result,
she died giving birth to Yuk-Su.

713
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:41,098
I vowed that day I would never
draw again for the rest of my life.

714
00:58:44,223 --> 00:58:46,179
Don't, Chai.
Please don't.

715
00:58:47,744 --> 00:58:50,463
That little punk -
of all the things he learns,

716
00:58:50,584 --> 00:58:53,257
why does he learn the worst
from me?

717
00:58:53,383 --> 00:58:58,741
Look. This is what he draws.
They're worthless. Throw them away.

718
00:59:00,344 --> 00:59:03,336
It's all right.
He's still very young.

719
00:59:03,463 --> 00:59:07,343
He'll change as he grows up.
Don't let it get to you.

720
00:59:07,463 --> 00:59:12,060
- Try and get some rest.
- Dear mother of Yuk-Su...

721
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:14,459
I'm so sorry.

722
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,458
Yuk-Su!

723
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:51,892
Why are you burning
your drawings?

724
00:59:53,264 --> 00:59:56,574
Siu-Yu tells me you sneak off
to practise kung fu.

725
00:59:56,704 --> 00:59:59,615
Do you think you can solve
all problems with force?

726
00:59:59,744 --> 01:00:01,416
Yes, I can.

727
01:00:01,543 --> 01:00:05,456
If I'd known kung fu
they couldn't have hurt my father.

728
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:08,621
And those men today wouldn't have
smashed your restaurant.

729
01:00:08,864 --> 01:00:10,501
That is true.

730
01:00:10,624 --> 01:00:13,900
With a personality like yours,
if you don't learn kung fu

731
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:15,857
somebody's going to kill you.

732
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:19,820
But why do you go out to learn?

733
01:00:19,944 --> 01:00:22,253
Don't you know
I've already been teaching you?

734
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:25,815
Yeah. Washing the wok
and tossing the noodles.

735
01:00:26,784 --> 01:00:29,741
Washing and tossing
are the basics of kung fu.

736
01:00:29,864 --> 01:00:32,981
"One - guts. Two - strength.
Three - kung fu." Yours is kung fu?

737
01:00:47,024 --> 01:00:48,980
Try it if you dare.

738
01:00:49,704 --> 01:00:53,458
- Easy if you've done it for years.
- What about your strength?

739
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:57,213
Can cooking noodles
give you a 500lb punch?

740
01:00:57,344 --> 01:00:58,617
Come here.

741
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:11,177
Use your new 500lb punch.

742
01:01:11,303 --> 01:01:12,498
Punch.

743
01:01:12,624 --> 01:01:13,534
Come on.

744
01:01:27,704 --> 01:01:31,663
Yuk-Su, controlled strength -
that's what you need to learn.

745
01:01:31,784 --> 01:01:34,820
Chinese kung fu is being able to
have control when you want.

746
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:40,257
I put my strength into my four fingers.
Therefore the egg didn't break.

747
01:01:40,383 --> 01:01:43,023
Still not convinced?
Let's try it again.

748
01:01:50,864 --> 01:01:53,616
- Wow! Washing the wok!
- Tossing the wok!

749
01:02:04,664 --> 01:02:07,940
Want to learn my kind of
beef noodle kung fu?

750
01:02:08,063 --> 01:02:08,940
Yes.

751
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:10,497
- Serious?
- Yes.

752
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:14,378
Then remember, if you learn my kung fu,
you can only use it in defence.

753
01:02:14,504 --> 01:02:16,016
- Yes.
- No attacking.

754
01:02:16,143 --> 01:02:17,213
I understand.

755
01:02:19,784 --> 01:02:23,140
There'll be time for that later.
Go and take a bath.

756
01:02:24,303 --> 01:02:26,259
Yes, Teacher.

757
01:02:34,223 --> 01:02:35,942
Dice the tomatoes.

758
01:02:36,063 --> 01:02:37,577
Slice the onion.

759
01:02:37,704 --> 01:02:39,934
Slice the tomatoes.
Dice the onion.

760
01:02:40,063 --> 01:02:42,019
Catch it.
Keep up with me.

761
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:44,259
Slice the pepper.
Slice the onion.

762
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:47,103
Flatten the ginger.

763
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:48,657
Dice this.

764
01:02:49,704 --> 01:02:51,262
Catch this tomato.

765
01:02:54,824 --> 01:02:58,418
Your hands are quick
but your eyes are far too slow.

766
01:02:58,543 --> 01:03:01,183
To learn kung fu
your reflexes must be fast.

767
01:03:01,303 --> 01:03:03,259
How would you stop this?
By hand?

768
01:03:03,383 --> 01:03:05,693
- By ducking?
- Of course! Now, remember.

769
01:03:06,344 --> 01:03:10,781
Teacher. Why do we only use
our hands and not our feet as well?

770
01:03:10,903 --> 01:03:13,133
- Using feet is hard.
- That's not so.

771
01:03:13,264 --> 01:03:16,415
I know a man who can kick birds
right out of the sky.

772
01:03:21,104 --> 01:03:22,856
Show me your kick.

773
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:24,133
I'll try.

774
01:03:24,264 --> 01:03:26,459
Left foot.

775
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:29,257
You knew which one
before I even started.

776
01:03:34,463 --> 01:03:36,182
Now,
kick again.

777
01:03:37,264 --> 01:03:37,980
One...!

778
01:03:39,543 --> 01:03:42,501
Now, before you moved your foot
your shoulder moved.

779
01:03:45,824 --> 01:03:48,702
How could you move your foot without
your shoulder moving?

780
01:04:05,264 --> 01:04:07,334
Use your foot
without casting a shadow.

781
01:04:08,463 --> 01:04:11,137
Now, there's one more
type of shadowless kick.

782
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:16,257
Hold on, Teacher.
Wait. Let me draw it first.

783
01:04:17,344 --> 01:04:19,699
I'll be quick.
I'll be quick.

784
01:04:26,344 --> 01:04:27,538
Great.

785
01:04:30,223 --> 01:04:30,973
Got it.

786
01:04:31,624 --> 01:04:33,659
Hold on tight.

787
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:35,740
You moved your left shoulder.

788
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:38,454
Got hold of it?

789
01:04:41,264 --> 01:04:43,459
That's great!
It didn't move.

790
01:04:44,903 --> 01:04:46,735
It didn't move.

791
01:04:46,864 --> 01:04:49,059
I need to draw it.
Be my model.

792
01:04:49,184 --> 01:04:51,300
What?
You want to draw me?

793
01:04:51,424 --> 01:04:54,700
More or less.
Now, copy the kicking pose I was in.

794
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:57,657
- Come on. Lift up your foot.
- I can't.

795
01:04:57,784 --> 01:04:59,615
Yes, you can.

796
01:04:59,744 --> 01:05:01,938
I'll get some paper.
Don't move.

797
01:05:03,223 --> 01:05:05,214
- I'm falling.
- Good, good.

798
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:07,414
That's great.
This is great.

799
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:17,579
Wash the wok.

800
01:05:19,184 --> 01:05:21,140
Wash the wok.

801
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:23,775
Wash them with both hands.

802
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,462
Wash, wash...

803
01:05:45,264 --> 01:05:47,414
- Teacher.
- Watch it! What are you doing?

804
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:50,660
- The shadowless kick.
- The shadowless kick?

805
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:52,854
- Practising it all night?
- Yeah.

806
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:56,863
You're overdoing it. You're bruising
yourself even before you perfect it.

807
01:05:57,344 --> 01:05:59,903
- You use this to practise with?
- Yeah.

808
01:06:00,024 --> 01:06:04,141
But this doesn't move. When you're
fighting, your opponent will move.

809
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:09,655
Why are you hanging these woks up
at this hour of the morning?

810
01:06:09,784 --> 01:06:13,617
- Washing the wok in the air.
- Think your opponent will stay still?

811
01:06:14,824 --> 01:06:16,097
Left.

812
01:06:17,024 --> 01:06:18,173
Right.

813
01:06:18,704 --> 01:06:19,898
Left...
right...

814
01:06:20,024 --> 01:06:21,298
Left...
right...

815
01:06:21,424 --> 01:06:22,379
Left...
right...

816
01:06:26,184 --> 01:06:30,302
- Don't starve me. I won't do it again.
- Go back to sleep.

817
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:34,656
Remember, while fighting you must
be agile while using your feet.

818
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:38,538
Once you lift your feet he'll kick your
other one, so you must be balanced.

819
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:42,453
- Balanced.
- Remember what I say. Balance.

820
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:45,017
Balance. My centre of balance
must be lower.

821
01:07:00,624 --> 01:07:02,819
Look at you.
Are you trying to be an eel?

822
01:07:03,543 --> 01:07:06,695
Yuk-Su, those eels...
I need them to make my noodles with.

823
01:07:06,824 --> 01:07:10,099
- What's all this?
- You said to keep low. I'm practising.

824
01:07:10,223 --> 01:07:14,137
Have you gone mad?
I want those eels dead. Cut them up.

825
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,936
- Okay.
- You've made him angry.

826
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:28,417
- Yuk-Su, are those eels ready?
- Yes, nearly.

827
01:07:34,824 --> 01:07:37,098
Teacher, I've made seven-colour
noodles for your birthday.

828
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:37,861
Really?

829
01:07:39,424 --> 01:07:42,972
Master, you've got to make a wish
before you blow out the candles.

830
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:47,655
Don't be daft - the wish shouldn't just
be mine. We should all share in it.

831
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:50,663
- Blow!
- Now, let's all blow together.

832
01:07:50,784 --> 01:07:54,492
- One, two, three!
- Happy birthday.

833
01:07:55,463 --> 01:07:58,183
- Yuk-Su.
- Fatty Hing, what a coincidence.

834
01:07:58,303 --> 01:08:00,977
Turn on the lights.
Come on in.

835
01:08:01,184 --> 01:08:02,821
Happy birthday.
No, just carry on.

836
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:06,414
- You're tense. Why are you here?
- Siu-Laan's in trouble. Come on.

837
01:08:07,223 --> 01:08:13,663
- What's the matter?
- Siu-Laan's been sold as a prostitute.

838
01:08:13,784 --> 01:08:15,615
How could you do that to her?

839
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:18,894
- You sold her as a whore?
- It wasn't me.

840
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:22,175
- Was it your father?
- It wasn't him either.

841
01:08:22,303 --> 01:08:25,023
- Her mother did it.
- Why'd she do that?

842
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,895
It's all your fault.

843
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:30,811
You told me not to keep a maid,
so I persuaded my dad.

844
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:34,777
And he agreed -
and set all the maids free.

845
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:38,453
But Siu-Laan's mother sold her again,
seeing as she's still young.

846
01:08:39,463 --> 01:08:43,139
- What do we do?
- Isn't your kung fu good now?

847
01:08:43,264 --> 01:08:46,222
Why don't you and Master Yat
go and save her?

848
01:08:46,344 --> 01:08:50,894
- No way. My father will kill me.
- So what do we do?

849
01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:56,454
Siu-Laan's in real trouble. It's your
fault. You told me not to have a maid.

850
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:00,257
One more drink...

851
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:02,339
Now he's getting drunk.

852
01:09:04,303 --> 01:09:08,091
Master. Here's some more wine.
It's from France. Good stuff.

853
01:09:10,503 --> 01:09:12,892
- Have another one.
- Don't mind if I do...

854
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:16,859
Thank you...

855
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:22,103
Need to sleep...

856
01:09:23,024 --> 01:09:25,378
- Come back soon.
- Okay.

857
01:09:32,463 --> 01:09:34,739
"NO.1 BEEF NOODLES"

858
01:09:40,184 --> 01:09:42,140
That's the girl.

859
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:56,619
I supply girls for the Chinatowns in
London, Korea and San Francisco.

860
01:09:56,743 --> 01:09:59,383
I supply them all.

861
01:09:59,503 --> 01:10:01,573
You've come to the right man.

862
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:09,543
- Have you considered the price?
- Oh, the price is no problem.

863
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,699
We just need to see the samples.

864
01:10:24,184 --> 01:10:25,172
Not here.

865
01:10:27,543 --> 01:10:31,661
These ones aren't suitable for France.
Do you have any more?

866
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,615
Move it.

867
01:10:39,063 --> 01:10:40,815
Come on.

868
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:44,382
- Go in.
- Walk!

869
01:10:44,503 --> 01:10:48,098
I'm not going.
Let go of me. No!

870
01:10:48,223 --> 01:10:50,692
- I'm not going!
- Move!

871
01:10:51,423 --> 01:10:52,822
Master.

872
01:10:53,223 --> 01:10:54,942
- Master!
- Siu-Laan!

873
01:10:55,063 --> 01:10:56,702
Let me go!

874
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,214
Master,
please take me home!

875
01:11:10,223 --> 01:11:11,258
Don't come any closer!

876
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:13,733
- Don't! Don't!
- Get out of here.

877
01:11:14,864 --> 01:11:16,262
Let's go.

878
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:22,659
Stay back!
Stay back!

879
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:25,536
Stay back!
Sonny...!

880
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:42,699
Look at that.
He didn't have to duck.

881
01:12:04,024 --> 01:12:06,094
Wow! 500lb.

882
01:12:18,303 --> 01:12:19,975
Keep away.

883
01:12:32,944 --> 01:12:35,173
Wasn't that something,
Fatty Hing?

884
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,893
- He even broke the door.
- Even the wall's dented.

885
01:13:51,663 --> 01:13:53,494
The "Scorpion Tactic".

886
01:14:07,184 --> 01:14:08,662
The "Windblown Grass".

887
01:14:27,944 --> 01:14:29,422
The meat isn't working.

888
01:14:30,303 --> 01:14:32,021
- Honourable Sir!
- Get away!

889
01:14:41,663 --> 01:14:43,813
- "Two Dragons At Sea".
- That's 1,000lb.

890
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,133
"Seeking A Failure Strategy".

891
01:15:03,663 --> 01:15:04,618
"Crouching Dragon".

892
01:15:32,743 --> 01:15:34,257
Honourable Sir!

893
01:15:35,903 --> 01:15:37,462
Come on!

894
01:15:44,143 --> 01:15:45,418
"Heaven's Knife
Whirlwind Kick".

895
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:10,775
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, quick!

896
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:14,780
Quick, quick,
let's go!

897
01:16:17,944 --> 01:16:19,775
Siu-Yu!

898
01:16:19,903 --> 01:16:22,577
They set fire to the restaurant.
Go save your father.

899
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:25,012
- We've got to go now!
- Siu-Yu!

900
01:16:25,223 --> 01:16:29,341
Quickly! Go back and save them.
Don't worry about me.

901
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:49,537
Here...

902
01:16:52,344 --> 01:16:53,776
Take him to hospital.
Quick!

903
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:55,696
Father!

904
01:16:57,663 --> 01:16:59,062
Teacher!

905
01:17:10,104 --> 01:17:12,220
Fire! Fire!

906
01:17:13,223 --> 01:17:14,895
How tragic!

907
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:17,141
- Father!
- Pour water!

908
01:17:17,264 --> 01:17:19,061
- Father!
- Don't go in!

909
01:17:20,864 --> 01:17:24,015
- Where's my teacher?
- He's gone to help your dad.

910
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:25,856
Teacher!

911
01:17:28,184 --> 01:17:30,253
Teacher!
Come back out!

912
01:17:31,024 --> 01:17:32,139
Father!

913
01:17:32,264 --> 01:17:33,582
Teacher!

914
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:38,339
Father!

915
01:17:38,463 --> 01:17:41,421
I'm going to save Siu-Yu.
Don't go in there.

916
01:18:00,663 --> 01:18:01,937
Teacher...

917
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:04,614
I dragged you into this.

918
01:18:05,624 --> 01:18:07,579
You're right.

919
01:18:09,223 --> 01:18:11,579
Forbearance is useless.

920
01:18:11,704 --> 01:18:15,821
For more than ten years
I've been concealing myself here.

921
01:18:15,944 --> 01:18:18,821
Hoping to forget the underworld,
all the hate.

922
01:18:20,944 --> 01:18:26,302
In the past, I was knifed and suffered
humiliation in silence.

923
01:18:28,743 --> 01:18:31,133
I hoped that grinning and bearing it
would bring peace.

924
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:32,776
Teacher!

925
01:18:32,903 --> 01:18:35,782
Do you know who I really am?

926
01:18:40,503 --> 01:18:43,257
I'm the assassin from
the Green Dragon Triad,

927
01:18:43,383 --> 01:18:46,375
called the Dragon Severer, the most
feared killer in the underworld.

928
01:19:31,223 --> 01:19:33,259
You punk!
You dare to come back?

929
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:47,052
Get the weapons.

930
01:19:47,184 --> 01:19:48,252
No need.

931
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:50,851
- Teacher, why did you throw it away?
- Together.

932
01:19:55,344 --> 01:19:58,177
You stupid old fool,
let's see if you can beat nine of us.

933
01:20:15,823 --> 01:20:16,778
Give me the stick.

934
01:20:16,903 --> 01:20:18,257
- Quick.
- Yes.

935
01:20:32,143 --> 01:20:33,178
Teacher, catch!

936
01:20:50,264 --> 01:20:52,413
This is the real
three-section stick.

937
01:20:53,423 --> 01:20:55,096
You've hit me,
Yuk-Su!

938
01:21:12,423 --> 01:21:14,732
- Come bathe with me.
- No!

939
01:21:14,864 --> 01:21:15,853
Don't!

940
01:21:15,983 --> 01:21:18,975
- Don't? Then you'll have to starve!
- Let me go!

941
01:21:21,104 --> 01:21:22,377
Help!

942
01:21:22,784 --> 01:21:24,057
Catch!

943
01:21:24,184 --> 01:21:25,536
Help!

944
01:21:34,663 --> 01:21:36,256
Help!

945
01:21:39,944 --> 01:21:42,173
Let me go.

946
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:44,092
Siu-Yu!

947
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,537
Sonny!

948
01:22:15,503 --> 01:22:17,653
- Sonny.
- Teacher!

949
01:22:17,784 --> 01:22:18,659
Sonny!

950
01:22:18,784 --> 01:22:21,014
- Free the maids first.
- Okay.

951
01:22:28,303 --> 01:22:31,534
You stupid old man.
Have you forgotten your humiliation?

952
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:45,703
Strange. How does he know
which foot I use before I use it?

953
01:23:47,264 --> 01:23:49,936
I see.
He's watching my shoulders.

954
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:55,576
Okay, I won't move.
Let's see what he does.

955
01:24:11,944 --> 01:24:13,935
"Southern shadowless kick".

956
01:24:18,864 --> 01:24:19,853
Watch.

957
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:21,098
Watch.

958
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:22,373
Watch, watch!

959
01:24:22,503 --> 01:24:23,333
Watch!

960
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:30,659
Even if you can predict my moves,
I can still kick you to death, old man.

961
01:25:15,463 --> 01:25:16,863
Don't just lie there!
Get up.

962
01:25:31,704 --> 01:25:32,819
Fatty.

963
01:25:32,944 --> 01:25:35,219
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

964
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:38,336
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Quickly, let's go!

965
01:25:38,463 --> 01:25:40,055
Quick! Quick!

966
01:25:40,184 --> 01:25:42,538
- Siu-Yu, I have to go. Fatty!
- What?

967
01:25:42,663 --> 01:25:45,132
Take Siu-Yu home.
I must help my Teacher.

968
01:25:45,463 --> 01:25:47,853
- Be careful.
- Go now.

969
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:13,579
Wow! Teacher,
you're the best.

970
01:26:17,063 --> 01:26:19,179
Watch out,
"Crouching Dragon"!

971
01:26:42,983 --> 01:26:44,894
Teacher!

972
01:27:13,503 --> 01:27:14,458
Teacher!

973
01:27:15,223 --> 01:27:16,213
How are you?

974
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:19,699
- Father?
- Sonny. Slaughter them!

975
01:27:22,184 --> 01:27:24,936
You hit my father.
I'm going to take your life.

976
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:50,492
Sonny!

977
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,733
You hit my Teacher,
I'll hit your father.

978
01:28:22,104 --> 01:28:23,014
Watch his shoulders.

979
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,573
Right foot.
Left foot.

980
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,374
Watch it!
Right foot.

981
01:28:39,024 --> 01:28:42,061
- Watch carefully.
- I did, but he was too quick.

982
01:28:52,264 --> 01:28:54,220
Do the "Shadowless Kick".

983
01:28:57,704 --> 01:28:59,934
You want me?
Come and get me.

984
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:05,857
How can you do it on a table?

985
01:29:30,864 --> 01:29:32,775
Grab his foot.
Wash the Wok.

986
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,418
- Teacher, I did it.
- Watch out.

987
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,782
Wash, wash.

988
01:30:25,303 --> 01:30:26,578
Yuk-Su!

989
01:30:42,463 --> 01:30:44,181
Wash.

990
01:30:52,503 --> 01:30:54,141
The "Scorpion Tactic".

991
01:31:04,264 --> 01:31:05,412
That hurts!

992
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:19,741
Yuk-Su,
what are you doing?

993
01:31:19,864 --> 01:31:21,581
The "Eel Tactic",
Teacher.

994
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:26,172
The boy's mad. I've fought
everywhere and never seen this.

995
01:31:45,784 --> 01:31:50,141
100 eels going up the beach.
I'll flatten you! I'll flatten you!

996
01:31:50,264 --> 01:31:51,332
I'll flatten you!

997
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:12,981
"Heaven's Knife
Whirlwind Kick"!

998
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:19,858
Watch.

999
01:32:25,463 --> 01:32:26,418
Toss the wok!

1000
01:32:34,864 --> 01:32:36,581
Wash the wok,
Yuk-Su!

1001
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:00,059
Stand firm,
extend all limbs!

1002
01:33:07,944 --> 01:33:10,173
"Southern Shadowless Kick".

1003
01:33:36,303 --> 01:33:39,853
I did it, Teacher!
I beat him!

1004
01:33:45,903 --> 01:33:49,783
"To be or not to be"
is from William Shakespeare.

1005
01:33:49,903 --> 01:33:54,978
This is an important speech in Hamlet
when the prince takes his revenge.

1006
01:33:55,823 --> 01:34:01,580
Hamlet was alone in the castle,
and his feelings...

1007
01:34:01,704 --> 01:34:03,854
Well,
you could say...

1008
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:10,896
Get up.

1009
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:12,695
That slap came from Lincoln.

1010
01:34:12,823 --> 01:34:14,701
This one's from Shakespeare.

1011
01:34:15,143 --> 01:34:17,578
Drawing comics in
the classroom...!

1012
01:34:18,344 --> 01:34:20,732
Fai Yuk-Su used
to draw in class.

1013
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:24,742
You compare yourself to him?
He is a genius. He's got an MBE.

1014
01:34:24,864 --> 01:34:26,855
Think you can get one?
