1
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,390
Mmm.

2
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,090
Mmm.

3
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,710
Get to the point already!

4
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,820
Okay. Alan, Jackie and
Lorelei are in a rock group together,

5
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,400
but when Lorelei got engaged to
Alan, it broke Jackie's heart.

6
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,900
So he left the group and
became a soldier of fortune...

7
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
known as the "Asian Hawk."

8
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,170
What the hell does
this story have to do...

9
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,300
with the missing pieces
of the Armour of God?

10
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,310
Well, the formidable
Asian Hawk has acquired...

11
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,710
some of the world's most
important art treasures.

12
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,780
I think I found a way
to persuade him to help us.

13
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,250
I'm convinced he can find
the other two pieces of armour.

14
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,250
Ah, I see.
Well, if we offer

15
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,220
him a good price, then maybe there's a chance
we'll get back the Armour of God.

16
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,950
You shut up.
He hasn't finished the story yet.

17
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm trying to tell you that
Jackie's still in love with the girl,

18
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,130
and we can use her
to help us get the armour.

19
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,160
- What do you mean?
- Well, if Jackie brings us the
sword in exchange for the girl,

20
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,790
then we'll really have what we wanted...
we will then possess all five pieces.

21
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,940
Kidnap this girl immediately.

22
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,700
# Can you feel the rumble
in this feeling #

23
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,290
# of that thunder inside you #

24
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,340
# Feel the earth is quaking
the air is softly shaking #

25
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,310
# around you #

26
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,040
# Shadows on the moon,
summer's coming #

27
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,270
# It's she that you are meeting #

28
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,910
# The midnight rider comes for you #

29
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,220
# Now is the time.
You know it's right #

30
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,380
- # And it's your destiny #
- # And it's your destiny #

31
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,390
# And there'll be
no more turning back #

32
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,660
# so take your place in history #

33
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,700
What are you doing?

34
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,870
# Something has got to change #

35
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,810
# When we ride, ride, ride #

36
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,750
# you know that nothing
will be the same #

37
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,690
# Midnight rider #

38
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,130
# Midnight rider #

39
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,700
# When we ride, ride #

40
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,440
# Ride across the sky, you know
that something has got to change #

41
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,940
# When you ride, ride #

42
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,250
# When we ride, ride, ride #

43
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,260
# See human life, you know
that nothing can be the same #

44
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,630
# Midnight rider #

45
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,430
# Midnight rider #

46
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,990
And now the main item in today's auction:

47
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,330
The legendary Sword of God said
to have been used by King Arthur
during the Crusades.

48
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,530
We'll start at 30,000.
I'll accept bids in increments of 5,000.

49
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,470
And now may I have
an opening bid, please?

50
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,300
Thirty-five, 40, 45.

51
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,380
Forty-five,
and then to 50.

52
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,310
Fifty, 55, 60.

53
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,510
Sixty-five. Now you understand this is
a priceless sword, gentlemen.

54
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,610
Do I hear more?
The gentleman bid 70.

55
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,380
Seventy. Do I hear more?

56
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,720
Yes? More? Gentlemen, 75.

57
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,450
- Do I hear more?
- 100,000.

58
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,050
The lady bids 100,000.
Excellent taste, madame.

59
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,600
100,000. Do I hear five more?
Five more?

60
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,460
- 105.
- 150.

61
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,910
One-fifty. Very generous.

62
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,240
At last we are approaching the true
value of this extremely precious sword.

63
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,910
Do I hear a bid of 155?

64
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,580
- Okay. Okay.
- Any advance on 150,000?

65
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,490
- 300,000.
- 300,000.

66
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,820
Incredible.
Any advances on 300,000?

67
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,860
Any advances?

68
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
it has been my honor and privilege...

69
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,400
to have been present
at such a historical moment.

70
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,530
- I thank you all for your generosity.
- You're crazy!

71
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,840
Okay. Not 300,000!

72
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,340
As a formality, I am closing
the bidding at 300,000.

73
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,910
Going once, going twice...

74
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,750
- 400,000.
- 400,000.

75
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,840
The lady had just
upped the price to 400.

76
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,690
Going once, going twice, sold!

77
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,990
Hi.

78
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,630
- Pretty nice auction, huh?
- You were lucky, too, to have sold it for so much.

79
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,040
- You are right.
- Nice car.

80
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,670
- Want a ride?
- All right.

81
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,580
Wait!

82
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,850
What's the matter?

83
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,750
I've changed my mind.
I really have to be going now.

84
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,690
My driver's waiting
over there.

85
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,930
- How about dinner?
- Go.

86
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,110
Thank you.

87
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,480
Room 206, please.
Thanks.

88
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,080
- Oh, Mr. Chan. Your messages.
- Huh?

89
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,090
Thank you.

90
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,200
Urgent. Please call back.

91
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,230
Need help.
Why haven't you called?

92
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm booking a plane ticket.

93
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,870
They've got me on standby.
Imperative that you wait.

94
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,140
I'm on flight 101,
landing in one hour.

95
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,050
Waiting for cab at airport.
Hope you've received messages.

96
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,550
Where have you been all day?
Waiting in lobby. Matter of life or death!

97
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,240
"Going to sleep. Wake me when you arrive."
Jackie!

98
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,970
She been kidnapped?
How much they want?

99
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,740
I've got money.
It's not that.

100
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,710
If they don't want money,
how the hell can I help you?

101
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,720
You've come
to the wrong person.

102
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,340
Not when I tell you what they're after.
They want the Armour of God.

103
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,110
Armour of God?

104
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,620
Yes, and if they don't get it,
they've threatened to kill Laura.

105
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,630
I just sold the sword this morning.

106
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,790
Well, we've got to buy
it back immediately.

107
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,730
Look, I told you.
I already sold it.

108
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,130
- But I know who had two other pieces...
- Great! Even better!

109
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,430
They belong to Mr. Bannon.
He's a major collector of antiques.

110
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,440
Let's go get them.

111
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,670
After what you did to me,
why should I help you?

112
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,970
Jackie, where's your compassion?
We're talking about Laura.

113
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,780
Everything's over between us.

114
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,780
How can you be so coldhearted?
We're friends.

115
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,010
What makes you think
we're still friends?

116
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,180
What's this?

117
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,950
We grew up together,
played the same games, dated Laura.

118
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,930
We're just like brothers.
How can you treat me like a stranger?

119
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,860
As far as I'm concerned,
I wish we never met!

120
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,700
We've been through this before.
I'm not interested in talking about this anymore.

121
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,700
You never treated me
as a friend.

122
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,770
Oh. I understand.

123
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,040
You're jealous 'cause she's with me.
Can't stand losing?

124
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,340
Hmm. I really didn't lose.

125
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,710
Sorry. I never realized
it was that bad.

126
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,820
I'll just have to come up
with another plan.

127
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,480
The only question is,
will she be alive when I find her?

128
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,850
Come on! Hey, this reminds me
of that time on the beach.

129
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,860
Wait a minute.
I wasn't drowning.

130
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,930
You didn't have to throw me
that life preserver.

131
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,330
I was doing perfectly all right,
and you know it.

132
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,930
Yeah, yeah.
But didn't you call out for help?

133
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,100
I've told you.
It was a secret...

134
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,260
- Hey, what does this say?
- "Vorsicht, Rau..."

135
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,990
- Not sure.
- I guess we'll find out.

136
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,000
Is there a bell?

137
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,100
- Anybody home?
- Let's keep on going.

138
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,620
Don't move!

139
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,280
Down! Heel! Heel!

140
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,190
Easy, now. Easy.

141
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,600
Sit. Sit!

142
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,600
- Shouldn't we run?
- Just... relax.

143
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,110
Excuse me.
Please follow me, gentlemen.

144
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,590
Bye-bye.
Well, now we know what the sign says.

145
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,760
You sure this is the right house?

146
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,440
I sure hope this Bannon's in a good mood.
Otherwise, we could end up like that.

147
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,940
You weren't scared, were you?

148
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,100
Oh!

149
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,440
Don't worry.
He has a chain around him.

150
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,780
He's only let loose at night.
Gentlemen, please follow me.

151
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,680
This place is a zoo.

152
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,160
Why are they so important to you, Jackie?
Did you find a potential buyer?

153
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,500
- I wish that was it...
- If I might...

154
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,730
My fiance's been kidnapped. In exchange
for her life, they've demanded the armour.

155
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,860
- Kidnappers, you say?
- I'll pay you anything.

156
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,140
You know, you guys,

157
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,580
I've heard a lot of stories in my day.

158
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,920
But this one...

159
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,860
I'm not really interested in parting
with any Armour of God pieces,

160
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,080
but there might be a few
similar items in my collection.

161
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,920
- May I show you?
- No. We don't want anything else.

162
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,690
Uh, I'm very interested.

163
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,700
I'm sure there's something you'd like.

164
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,930
- Please come with me.
- Mmm.

165
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,940
Wait.

166
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,840
Gentlemen, follow me.

167
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,850
Oh, my!

168
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,510
This is amazing.
I've never seen such a collection.

169
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,920
Actually, museums
from all over the world...

170
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,190
frequently borrow from me
for their exhibitions.

171
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,750
Oh, where's the Armour of God?
Think we can have a look?

172
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,770
Over here.

173
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,100
There you are.

174
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,610
You've got to be kidding!
It's just lying here unguarded.

175
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,580
Oh, to me they're merely
simple acquisitions.

176
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,770
Not that everyone shares my opinion.

177
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,780
So tell me about Armour of God.

178
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,120
If it's not that important,
why keep it?

179
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,160
Hmm. Sit down.
Sit down.

180
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,030
Long before the birth of Christ,
dark forces roamed the earth.

181
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,300
Barbarians held power and terrorized the masses,
thus beginning the Dark Ages.

182
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,470
And so it remained for centuries
until the Crusaders emerged...

183
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,010
to wage war against
these evil cults.

184
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,480
Needless to say,
the Crusaders were victorious.

185
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,490
As a remnant of their victory,

186
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,000
the armour and weapons have been
handed down through the ages,

187
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,900
regarded as symbols of power
and much sought after.

188
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,370
This brings us back to the present.

189
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,270
Only five pieces still exist.

190
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,770
That's the Armour of God.

191
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,210
So you believe all this?

192
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,210
It's been rumored...

193
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,250
there are many groups of men
living deviously in encampments.

194
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,020
These men believe that, if they can obtain
all five pieces of the Armour of God...

195
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,560
and destroy them,
they will obtain great power.

196
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,690
And what do you think, Mr. Bannon?
Do you think it's within grasp?

197
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
I don't know the answer to that.

198
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,270
Well, time is moving on, gentlemen.
I was not prepared for your visit.

199
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,040
So if you will excuse me, please.

200
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,140
It's getting rather late, and you've come
such a long way, why don't you spend the night?

201
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,720
- I don't think we sh...
- Ah, this is such a beautiful place!

202
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,580
- I love it here. It would be our pleasure.
- That's fine.

203
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,180
Since you like it so much,
the matter is settled.

204
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,190
If there's anything you need,
just call my servant.

205
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,230
Be sure that our guests
receive the best attention.

206
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,330
- You two just make yourselves at home.
- Good night.

207
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,430
- Good night.
- Follow me.

208
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,410
Thanks.
There you go.

209
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,910
Well, it's too bad
we already ate...

210
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,680
because there's no way
we can finish all this food.

211
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,250
Well, maybe you're not so hungry,
but the dogs and leopards are.

212
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,850
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We can use the food to distract the animals.

213
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,420
You're kidding.
Are you suggesting we steal something?

214
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,030
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

215
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,260
Don't even think about it.

216
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,700
I'm taking that armour
with or without you.

217
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,110
Have a little respect, huh?

218
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,870
Ha! Respect.
What about the kidnappers?
Do you wanna see Laura killed?

219
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,880
- Hey!
- Then wake up and respect our situation.

220
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,250
We have to get that armour back
at any cost.

221
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,260
Good night!

222
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,600
Shh. Stay.

223
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,180
Well, what are you going to do now?

224
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,620
If I move, they'll bite me.

225
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,950
You can relax. If I wanted them to bite,
I would have already told them to attack.

226
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,560
Besides, they don't eat Chinese food.

227
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,030
Come on!

228
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,800
Go on. Good boy.

229
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,880
It's you.

230
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,040
This is my daughter May.

231
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,050
Yes. He's the one from the auction.

232
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,880
Oh! You two know each other.

233
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,550
Well, let's open the champagne.
Hey, Jackie!

234
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,350
Is this what you brought
back from Africa?

235
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,790
- Well, is this the one? Is it?
- Put it down.

236
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,830
So, you captured the sword,
brought it back here,

237
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,530
then took it to the auction
and drove the price up.

238
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,940
Sir, if I knew you wanted the sword,
I would have brought it to you.

239
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,710
Oh, so you're accusing him
of cheating. Hmm!

240
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,480
And you were stealing
from my father.

241
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,980
He's so desperate
he cannot see straight.

242
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,990
Scout's honor.

243
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,280
I will return it in perfect shape
after I use it to rescue my fiancée.

244
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,220
- What now?
- I guess this is it.

245
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,060
Open up the gates.

246
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,230
I'd like to let this go, but, uh...

247
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,310
What if your daughter
got kidnapped, eh?

248
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,470
Haven't you done enough?

249
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,070
Go on. Tell him, Jackie.

250
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,340
I've had enough of these games.
There's nothing left for us to say here.

251
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,550
Come on. Tell him what we
talked about, remember? Hey.

252
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,590
All right. I'll get you a complete
set of the armour.

253
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,920
Um, tell them I'll be right there.

254
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,620
Go ahead. Do it.

255
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,600
The set consists of five pieces.
The kidnappers have asked for only three.

256
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,600
That means they may already have two.

257
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,930
Oh, really?
That's nothing I don't know already.

258
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,410
If I could prove to them
that I have three pieces,

259
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,570
it might entice them into
showing me the other two,

260
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,580
and then I'll bring you
a complete set.

261
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,550
- No deal.
- You know, I've got an idea.

262
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,380
- Mmm?
- I go with them.

263
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,510
- No.
- Hey. Mr. Bannon, that's a brilliant idea.

264
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,720
- Nothing to worry about.
- Daddy?

265
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,990
- Yes?
- Hmm?

266
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,120
All right.

267
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,890
But my daughter must be
in charge of this operation.

268
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,730
I guess there's always
a price to pay.

269
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,140
- I think we're going to make a great team.
- Hey.

270
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,140
Oh! Oh!

271
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,620
- Wow. It's great.
- What is it?

272
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,990
You won't like it.

273
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,490
- Let me try some.
- Go ahead.

274
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,500
Come on.
Don't get so depressed.

275
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,360
Tomorrow we'll meet those kidnappers
and free Laura, huh?

276
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,300
Don't forget.
I'm coming too.

277
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,310
Don't give me that look.
I think I can be of some help to you.

278
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,040
I happen to be
an excellent marksman.

279
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,080
I came in third
in the European pistol shoot.

280
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,450
Tell me, in the competition,
were there only two women?

281
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,520
Ooh! God! Mmm!

282
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,540
You don't like it?

283
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,440
Tastes awful.

284
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,940
Well, I love Chinese cheese.

285
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,380
Excuse me.

286
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,810
Jackie, this stuff's spoiled.

287
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,480
Sure. I know.

288
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,490
- What do you mean?
- Mine's real butter.

289
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,490
Oh.

290
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,600
Hmm?

291
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,570
Well, how will the kidnappers know we're here?

292
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm not quite sure.
All they said was go to the marketplace.

293
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,350
Okay. Alan, you've got
to look like you're alone.

294
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,510
So, Jackie, don't follow him
too closely. You got that?

295
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,850
- Yes, May.
- Everything will work out just fine. Trust me.

296
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,150
I'll stake out a good spot.
Move out.

297
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,390
Oh, she sounds like a real professional.

298
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,790
She has no idea what she's doing.

299
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,890
They'll kill Laura if they
discover it's all a hoax.

300
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,470
They are not going to kill Laura.
Don't worry.

301
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,930
You keep forgetting.
I've done this before.

302
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,940
Come on.

303
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,840
Okay. This is it.
I'm over here.

304
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,940
Hey. Don't go too far.
I may need your help.

305
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,950
Don't worry.

306
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,820
Oh, nice to see you.
Hey! Hi!

307
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,360
Do you believe in God?

308
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,360
I'm waiting for someone.
Laugh off!

309
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,190
You must believe if you want
to see her alive again.

310
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,530
Laura!

311
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,470
Brother Mark.
So good to see you!

312
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,520
It's nice to see you.

313
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,700
Keep walking.

314
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,030
- All right. Where's the armour?
- Hmm. Right here.

315
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,040
- Give me that!
- Hey! Hold it!

316
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,040
You'll have it
when I get my fiancée.

317
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,710
- It's not here!
- What?

318
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,610
Oh. It was there in the car.
It must have been switched!

319
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,710
- Come on!
- Someone m... Help! Let go!

320
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,050
No! I had the stuff! I had it all!

321
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,060
They were...

322
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,890
Let go!

323
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,050
- What are you doing?
- Huh? Mmm.

324
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,600
Come on.

325
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,840
Huh?

326
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,080
Oh! Fight here.

327
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,050
Eh? Yeah.

328
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,560
Hey, Jackie.
Come over here with me and stand.

329
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,130
Co- me on! Right here!
Shoot him! Quick, shoot him!

330
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,300
Whoa!
What's she doin'?

331
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,570
She's trying to kill us.
What kind of plan is that?

332
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,510
- Let's go!
- Come on. Let's go.

333
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,580
- No, wait. After them.
- Huh?

334
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,920
Hold it.

335
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,600
Why are you standing there?
Get 'em!

336
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,820
- What do we do?
- Run.

337
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,890
Run? That's your idea?

338
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,600
Coming through!
Look out!

339
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,450
Go!

340
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,890
We should have given the real armour.
Think what they're going to do to Laura now!

341
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,330
- Stop whining! It won't save her.
- Shut up! I'm fed up with you!

342
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,030
What are we going to do now?
Laura.

343
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,370
Think of something,
and it better be fast.

344
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,530
Hey! Look out!

345
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,330
Watch out!

346
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,210
Hey! Watch out!

347
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,960
Over there!

348
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,900
No!

349
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,380
Hold on tight!

350
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,320
They're gaining on us!
Go faster!

351
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,560
What are you doing?

352
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,800
Okay, that's it!
They asked for it. Hold on!

353
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,510
Hey! Hey, back off!

354
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,810
Go! Go!

355
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,080
Hurry up!

356
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,860
Oh, my God!
They're on us! Stop!

357
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:53,500
Jackie!

358
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,880
That was great!
Did we lose them?

359
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,690
Oh.

360
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,620
- Oh, no.
- We're okay.

361
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,960
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll show you.

362
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,120
What? Show me what?

363
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,570
Jackie, what are you doing?

364
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,130
Jackie!

365
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,280
Bye-bye!

366
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,720
- Hurray!
- Hurray! All right!

367
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,490
That was just terrific!
Lucky you've got this car.

368
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,960
I never leave home without it.

369
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,880
Any table is fine.

370
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,500
- Three beers, please.
- Oui, oui, Monsieur. Three beers.

371
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,340
I think that's the guy.

372
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,510
You're kidding.
You think he knows something?

373
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,150
What the hell are we gonna do now?
The whole day is gone,
and we haven't gotten anywhere.

374
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,520
Yeah. You're right.
We should do something.

375
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,460
Three beers.

376
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,620
Nine hundred dinari, s'il vous plait.

377
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,960
- Here. Keep the change.
- Merci, Monsieur.

378
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,160
- Can I ask you something?
- Hmm.

379
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:02,680
- What are you saying? I'm not sure I understand.
- Try this.

380
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,710
Oh, 100 U.S. dollars.

381
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,840
Whenever I visit a new place,
I always like to ask a lot of questions.

382
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,280
- Am I making myself clear?
- Oh, I think I know what you mean.

383
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,380
This morning at the market,
I saw a few men in black robes.

384
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,080
How do I find them?

385
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,590
- They're from the monastery south of here.
- How do I...

386
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,930
- How far south?
- Mmm. Up the mountain.

387
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,590
- Oh!
- Mmm?

388
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,130
Hey. I think that's enough.

389
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,870
What do they usually do when they come,
come down from the mountain?

390
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,640
Oh, every Monday they come
into town to buy food,

391
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,340
and when they leave,
they take some of the girls with them.

392
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,680
- Some girls?
- Alan, okay. That's enough. Come on. Let's go.

393
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,680
- Oh, nothing else?
- Hey, wait!

394
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,680
- Jackie, what is he talking about?
- They're hookers.

395
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,310
Hold on.
One more question for me.

396
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,320
- Yes?
- Hmm!

397
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,650
If anyone happens to ask,
we were never here.

398
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,660
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

399
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,100
- Who are you?
- Exactly.

400
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,780
Here you are.
See you next month.

401
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,220
- Bless you, brother.
- Right. Bye-bye.

402
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,250
Let's get back. Oh.

403
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,490
Whoa!

404
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,500
Hey, don't! Stop that!

405
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,910
- How did you get here?
- What are you doing here?

406
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,950
Do you realize you might ruin our plan?
You're putting yourself in great danger.

407
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,110
I'm all right.
Don't worry.

408
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,250
We're going to be caught.
This means nothing to me.

409
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,550
The monastery.

410
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,620
- Oh, hi!
- Come on, ladies. Here.

411
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,960
Let's go.
Right this way.

412
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,970
No pushing.

413
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,970
- Hi.
- One at a time.

414
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,300
Blessings in the name
of wealth and power.

415
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:34,380
Using our wealth and fortitude, we must
establish a kingdom from the power of Satan.

416
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,090
We are gathered here as mortal beings
to follow Lucifer's path...

417
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,830
in search of the power that is known
as the elusive Armour of God.

418
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:52,000
I will now recite from the fourth chapter,
fifth verse of the book of Megon.

419
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,940
There are intruders on the grounds.

420
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,140
What?
Are you sure?

421
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,850
Yes. Move along, ladies.
Move along.

422
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,860
"Stoop not down, therefore,
for an abyss lies beneath the world,

423
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,270
reached by a descending ladder
that has seven steps,

424
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,200
reached by a descending pathway
that has seven gates.

425
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:30,940
There is established a world
of an evil and fatal force.

426
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,480
For from the canopies of the world
leaps forth the evil demon...

427
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,610
the evil god, the evil genius,
the evil devil.

428
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,820
Sir, there's strangers among us.

429
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,590
And the dead will rise
and smell the incense."

430
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,920
Carry on here.

431
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,360
Go forth and rejoice!

432
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,370
You. Come with me.

433
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,470
Hey, he's taking May away.

434
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,200
- So maybe we should just go and hide.
- What are you doing?

435
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,610
- Stop fooling around.
- Okay.

436
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,910
Remember to be happy.
Come on. Be happy.

437
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,090
Oh, happy day! Rejoice!

438
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,190
- Stop it, already!
- Hey!

439
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,200
- What's your problem? I was rejoicing.
- Back!

440
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,530
Would you knock it off?
We gotta get serious.

441
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,730
I'll get serious
when you get serious.

442
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,900
Come on. Really.
Let's find May.

443
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,170
May's gonna be all right.
I'm worried about Laura. Let's go.

444
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,470
You're still not serious.

445
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,010
- Don't worry, my sweet.
- What is that?

446
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,420
- It's now time for the plan.
- What do you mean? Leave me alone!

447
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,990
Inform the chief lama that we now have
successfully administered the serum...

448
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,360
to allow the girl to leave
the monastery as soon as possible.

449
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,370
Understood?

450
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,770
How long do you think
the drug will last?

451
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,370
Three days,
and during that time,

452
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,450
she'll be completely
under our control.

453
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,010
- Good.
- You will give your life to serve.

454
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,150
- I give my life to serve.
- You must find Jackie and bring him to us.

455
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,590
- Make him follow the brothers' code.
- And I must also find Jackie.

456
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,320
Steal the Armour of God,
and then we will set you free.

457
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:06,490
And steal the Armour of God.

458
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,580
Huh? What are you doing?

459
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,920
Oh, can I fill up
your glass for you?

460
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,120
- You're not a prostitute.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I am. Trust me.

461
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,660
- Who sent you here? Tell me.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Come to bed.

462
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:42,130
You wanted to hit me with that bottle.
Who the hell are you anyway?

463
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,760
Nobody! I'm just a small town girl.

464
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,600
Huh?

465
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,610
Don't move.

466
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,270
How about that drink, huh?

467
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,100
Uh, oh, okay.
Yes, sir.

468
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,100
- Hey, what are we going to do?
- Act like you belong.

469
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,110
- What do you mean?
- Just watch.

470
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,340
All right.
Praise almighty Buddha.

471
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,600
- Buddha?
- Ha! Did you like that?

472
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,340
- You gotta admit that was pretty great.
- Wait.

473
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,010
He's right behind us.
Don't turn around.

474
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,630
Hey.

475
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,500
- What the hell did you do with the girl?
- What girl?

476
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,200
- Chinese girl!
- She's down there.

477
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,210
There's some guard by her room.

478
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,470
- Hey!
- Me?

479
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,840
- He's all yours.
- Oh!

480
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,080
Come on. Wake up, sir.

481
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,520
Come on. Wake up!

482
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,180
Wake up?
How about I just take these, hmm?

483
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,840
That's a good one.
Yes, it is.

484
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,780
No way.
The most I can handle is two of them.

485
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,820
What about the third guy?
Don't expect me to fight.

486
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,360
- My hand still hurts.
- What good are you?

487
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,660
- Damn!
- Come on!

488
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,810
- Will you quit fooling around?
- Oh.

489
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,930
This is for you.

490
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,660
A two-by-four?
What, you don't think I can handle them?

491
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,670
No, of course you can handle them.

492
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,600
You can soften them up,
and I'll finish them off.

493
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,700
Ah! Okay, but I'm using
the board under protest.

494
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,510
- Go!
- Hmph! Follow me.

495
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,660
Get the other two!

496
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,790
What happened?

497
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,870
All righty. Oh.

498
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,870
Thanks a lot.

499
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,300
- But I softened them up for you.
- Yeah. Why didn't you...

500
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,310
Shh!
Someone's coming.

501
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,750
Oh!

502
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,220
Ow! She hit me!

503
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,290
- Christ!
- How was I supposed to know?

504
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,660
- You okay?
- Yeah. All right.

505
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,200
Did they...
Are you all right?

506
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,390
- I can take care of myself.
- I'm glad you're okay.

507
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,870
Let's look for the keys.

508
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,870
Maybe these are what you're after?

509
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,700
You're fantastic!

510
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,570
- Aren't you glad we brought her?
- Sure.

511
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,880
- Help me tie 'em up?
- All right.

512
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,850
Lorelei!
Talk to me, Laura!

513
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,690
- Laura! I've been so worried!
- Laura.

514
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,490
Don't you recognize me?

515
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,200
Lorelei, talk to me.
Just tell me you're all right.

516
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,540
Uh, okay.

517
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,200
Everything's okay.
I'm taking you back with me.

518
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:20,640
- I think she must be in shock.
- You guys, we gotta hurry.

519
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,870
If we don't go soon,
they'll find us.

520
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,080
And the truck's about to go.

521
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,180
Come on. Let's hurry.

522
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,190
- There ya go.
- Here. Wear this.

523
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,360
- Come on!
- Let's go.

524
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,710
- See you next time.
- Thank you!

525
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,180
- Here, let me help you with that.
- Thank you!

526
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,220
- I'll remember that!
- Bye! Bye!

527
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,120
- See you next time.
- Come back soon.

528
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,450
- Yeah. Bye!
- Bye!

529
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,970
Hmm.

530
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,970
Thank you.

531
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,680
Okay. I've booked your tickets for you.
You leave tomorrow.

532
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,940
Yeah.
I think we better stay here tonight.

533
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:31,640
Yes. A good night's rest will
do her good. All right, love.

534
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,410
You know, we still haven't gotten
what you promised my father.

535
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,420
Can't we talk about this later?

536
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,220
- About what?
- Oh, uh...

537
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,230
Uh, it's nothing. We'll take care of it
tomorrow. Go up and take a bath.

538
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,320
Yeah, yeah.
Good night.

539
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,330
- Good night.
- Come on.
- I'll be right back.

540
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,300
Hey, thanks for everything.

541
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,040
Hey, that's all right.
I'm just glad everything worked out.

542
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,370
Hey, it means more to me
than you'll ever know.

543
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,310
- Thanks, Jackie.
- Good night.

544
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,530
Good night.

545
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,560
Come on. Let's go.

546
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,650
I'm still really worried about her.

547
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,650
- There is something about the way she was acting.
- She'll be okay.

548
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,880
You know, for a while there,
I was worried something might happen to you.

549
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:07,140
Is this gonna cost me?

550
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,320
Sorry.

551
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,520
Good night.

552
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,860
You're kidding.

553
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,390
- You want to see the Armour of God now?
- Mm-hmm.

554
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,340
Why don't we wait
till tomorrow, all right?

555
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,040
- I want to see it now.
- All right, all right.

556
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,540
I'll be right back, okay?

557
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,800
What's up? I thought you were going
to bed two hours ago.

558
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,700
- Uh, Lorelei is, uh...
- She's what?

559
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:12,540
- What are you talking about?
- She's different.

560
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,380
Yeah, I noticed.
Something was wrong.

561
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,280
I don't know what she's been through,
but she just woke up, and she...

562
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,480
- Well, she woke me up, and...
- Get to the point.

563
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:27,390
Well, she says she wants to see the Armour of God.
How'd she know about it?

564
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,290
She could have overheard us.
She could have talked to May.

565
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,230
Kidnappers might have told her.
What's the big deal?

566
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,290
Right. You made your point.
So, should we show it to her?

567
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,500
I don't know.
It's in May's room.

568
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,970
May's bedroom.
You're fast. Oh, yeah!

569
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,980
- Let's go. Do you want the Armour of God or not?
- Jackie.

570
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,810
Go on.

571
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,820
Go ahead.

572
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,020
No answer. She must be busy.
Let's come back later.

573
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,260
Let's take a look, shall we?
Hey. Hello!

574
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,630
- She's not here.
- Let's wait outside till she comes back.

575
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:10,290
Hey, come on. Let's take it.
Lorelei's waiting. May won't even miss it.

576
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,740
Alan, hurry up.

577
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,670
- Huh?
- Uh...

578
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,010
Jackie,
what do you think you're doing here?

579
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,980
May.

580
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,180
Uh, oh... Mmm.

581
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,550
You have no business being here after what
you said to me. You're rude and inconsiderate.

582
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,720
You were planning to steal
the armour, weren't you?

583
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:38,730
Uh, uh, me?

584
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,060
Now I see why you were trying
to get close to me.

585
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,660
- Uh...
- Just to get your hands on the armour.

586
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,670
Uh, May... Oh!

587
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,200
I came here to apologize.

588
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,640
- I realize what I did was wrong.
- Why should I believe anything?

589
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,190
- Why not?
- Mmm! You're hopeless!

590
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:03,480
Oh, May! You know I was only joking.

591
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,920
- Is that all?
- Is that all?

592
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,560
What do you want from me?

593
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,160
Why didn't you kiss me before?

594
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:18,030
- Well, I didn't think I should. Uh...
- Don't touch me!

595
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,000
Oh! What happened?

596
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,810
Uh, you're right.
I made a mistake.

597
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,000
I don't understand you.

598
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,850
Maybe we should go back
to the living room and start over again.

599
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,350
Well, why can't we just stay here?

600
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,290
It's more romantic.
Let me show you.

601
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,380
Come on.
The fireplace, the view.

602
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,190
- You know. Oh, Jackie.
- Whew!

603
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,010
L-Laura! Uh, uh...

604
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,720
Jackie?

605
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:20,230
Alan and Laura
have taken the Armour.

606
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:21,230
Why?

607
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,900
I'm going to find out.

608
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,240
- Well, can I help you?
- Yes. Here's what you do.

609
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,310
Alan. Alan!

610
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,250
They must've heard something.

611
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,260
All right now! Quiet!

612
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,060
- See anything?
- No.

613
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:01,040
No, it's nothing.

614
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,210
Goin' back.

615
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,120
Alan. Shh.

616
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,160
- Jackie!
- Cowboy.

617
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,070
Hi.

618
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,900
Don't worry.

619
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,500
You'll be all right.
I will get you out.

620
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:11,170
- What did you call him?
- Cowboy.

621
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,380
That's what
she used to call me.

622
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,950
Super.
Isn't this special.

623
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,850
Look.
Let's not get into this right now.

624
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,890
Well, here we go again.
You're always being the hero.

625
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,300
I'll tell you what.
Do you really want to be a hero?

626
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,730
You bet.
How do we get out of here?

627
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,810
I'll go with Lorelei.

628
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,600
Guess you have to find your own way out.

629
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,610
My own way out?

630
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:41,700
I promised that I will try to save Laura.

631
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,280
I didn't say I'd save you.

632
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:46,850
So. You backstabbing pig you.

633
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,050
This is the chance
you've been waiting for, isn't it?

634
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,390
And after all we've been through.
I can't believe this is it.

635
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:57,220
I thought that,
after all these years,

636
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,730
you and I would always be friends.

637
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:04,290
That's enough of your sob story.
Let's get out of here quick.

638
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,340
We must help him.
We can't leave him here.

639
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,970
Laura, forget about me.
Get out.

640
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,340
No matter what,
I still love you.

641
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:15,680
Jackie, how can you do this?

642
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,880
You must understand,
when you kissed me the other night,

643
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,610
I realized that we
were meant to be together.

644
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,280
The only real thing
standing in my way is Alan.

645
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:28,590
So I have come to claim
what's rightfully mine.

646
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:32,030
Yes, you're right.
I'm sorry I ever came between you.

647
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:34,690
I'm truly sorry
for what I put you through.

648
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,030
You deserve her
far more than me.

649
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,630
Laura, leave me alone and go.
Follow Jackie.

650
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:45,040
I want you to lead a happy life,
my darling.

651
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,050
That's all I want.

652
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,010
Please go.

653
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,140
Alan, I love you so.
You have a good heart.

654
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,660
I'd rather die with him
than go with you.

655
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,790
Great. You know,

656
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,660
ever since I left the group,
I wondered if you really loved her.

657
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:09,000
For years, it bothered me.

658
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,970
Now I'm happy to see your love is true.

659
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:15,400
Come on, you two.
Let's go.

660
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:18,480
All three of us,
back together again?

661
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,340
Yeah,
three of us against a hundred of them.

662
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,680
Well, I can hardly wait.

663
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,180
Look, I came to get the Armour of God.

664
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,410
You know that we only borrowed it,
and I promised to bring it back.

665
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,550
Forget about the Armour of God.
We should get out.

666
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:38,430
We'll get out, all right,
with the Armour, and I will show you the way.

667
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:41,760
Great. I hope we make it.

668
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,700
- Stay close behind me.
- I'm ready. Stay close...

669
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,280
I'm ready.

670
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,610
Hey, hey. I think this way's better.

671
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,020
- Fine. Go that way.
- See? He never listens to me.
Where are you going?

672
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,330
Now, as soon as you get out of here, look for May.
She will be waiting for you.

673
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,490
- You'll be there?
- Me?

674
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,470
We'll just have to wait and see.

675
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:22,800
Don't you listen to him, Laura.

676
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,310
He's already working on a plan as we speak.

677
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:29,970
You take the tunnel on the right
and find your way out.

678
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,740
- Find our way out?
- May's waiting.

679
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:38,680
- You really want me to give a knife to May?
- Very funny.

680
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,590
What are you trying to say?
You never take me seriously.

681
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:44,600
We've been through this already.
You're hopeless.

682
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:48,000
I didn't ask you to come untie me.
I can take care of Lorelei.

683
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,000
First it's a two-by-four,
then you stick a knife in my face.

684
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,660
Take it back.
I don't need this knife!

685
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,440
Jackie.

686
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,380
Down there?

687
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,830
Stand back! I have a knife.

688
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,690
Get back!
Go on. Go!

689
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,880
Some of you men search.

690
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:37,280
See if there are
any more intruders. Go.

691
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,700
Ooh.

692
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,140
Heavy.

693
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,150
After him.

694
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,480
- Go after him!
- Jackie!

695
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,560
Let go!

696
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,560
Don't fight!

697
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,540
Those are my good pants!

698
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,630
Let go of me!

699
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:43,570
Let go!

700
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,720
Get off!

701
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:54,760
Now tell us how you got here!

702
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,090
On with it.

703
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:06,900
- Jackie!
- Take Laura with you!

704
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,800
Go! Get out!

705
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,820
Quick, behind you!

706
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,060
- Jackie! Be careful!
- Come on! Let's go!

707
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,760
After him.

708
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,570
All right.

709
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,740
Surround him.

710
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,890
Wait! Hold on.
No, no. Wait!

711
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,470
Aah!

712
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,430
Quick.

713
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,410
Back! Back!

714
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,040
- Back!
- Here.

715
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,050
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Aah!

716
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,450
I'll keep them busy.
You run for it.

717
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,650
Shouldn't we take some time
and think it over?

718
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,450
When I count to three, run.
One, two, three.

719
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,160
Let's get out of here!

720
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,500
Grab my hand!

721
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,570
Quick!

722
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,150
Easy! Easy!

723
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,550
Where do you think you're going?
I was just getting started!

724
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,920
- Hey!
- Come on. Let's get him.

725
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,990
Come on. Don't let him get away.

726
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,300
- See anything?
- No.

727
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,810
I looked upstairs.
I can't see a thing.

728
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,210
- How about over there?
- No. Where is he?

729
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,970
- Heading up.
- Hello.

730
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,570
- Wait! There he is!
- Get him!

731
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:49,890
I'm so glad
that you could join me.

732
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:57,430
- So you are the Asian Hawk?
- Correct.

733
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,520
We're honored
with your presence.

734
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:02,690
Let's stop playing games
and get down to business, okay?

735
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,670
What business?
I already have everything I want.

736
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:10,170
You don't really think I'm going to leave
without the Armour of God, do you?

737
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,610
I don't really think
you'll be leaving at all.

738
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,820
I'm not going to let you
get away with this.

739
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,850
For centuries you've tried to secure
the power of the Armour of God.

740
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,860
And now that you have them,
you think the world is yours. Over my dead body.

741
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,620
Now, that shouldn't be a problem to achieve.
Stop wasting my time.

742
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:35,030
You know, if it's real power you're after,
perhaps I can...

743
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,130
interest you in some... money?

744
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,700
Money.
I live only for the thrill of destruction.

745
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:48,140
Kill him.

746
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,180
Now are you ready for death?

747
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,950
You think you're so smart,
getting girls to defend you?

748
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,820
Ah, you never cease to amaze me.

749
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,550
Such an honorable gentleman,
always thinking of the ladies.

750
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:12,990
But don't let their looks deceive you.
They are merciless killing machines.

751
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,900
You'll surely die.

752
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,060
It's not about honor.
It's about respect for your fellow man.

753
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:22,000
You think that killing
is a proper means to an end?

754
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,510
But I'd rather die
than follow those beliefs.

755
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:29,010
Your attempts to spread evil
will go no further, so help me, God.

756
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:54,540
Ooh!

757
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,850
Uh?

758
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,180
Sorry.

759
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,570
Aah...

760
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:46,920
I guess I'll take the Armour of God
and hit the road. What do you think?

761
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:51,460
No, no. Surely you don't think
our business is completed here, do you?

762
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:03,890
What else you got?

763
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,470
I've had enough of him!

764
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,380
Hold it!

765
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,680
- All right.
- All right?

766
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,750
Get him!

767
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,360
Ooh!

768
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,160
Excuse me.

769
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,790
Need a light?

770
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:40,730
Last chance.
This is it.

771
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,570
All right.

772
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,040
So, we will all die.

773
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,410
We won't die, men.
I promise you that he's bluffing.

774
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,250
Rise up and defeat him.

775
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:55,290
Time to call my bluff.

776
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,560
Haven't you had enough of this?

777
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:09,790
- I guess you must be...
- Oh, my God!

778
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,960
Get me some water!

779
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:29,920
Wait!

780
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:53,380
Ooh! God!

781
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:09,420
Whew!

782
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:12,160
Uh-oh. Oh!

783
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,300
Whoa!

784
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:16,960
Quick, hurry!
Hurry!

785
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,800
Whoa!

786
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,370
# Out of the east a dream comes #

787
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,470
# out from the sky #

788
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,480
# Setting me free #

789
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,950
- Are you all right?
- # Through the clouds #

790
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:12,950
# I will fly #

791
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,180
# The mountains must yield to me #

792
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:18,850
# Thunder will roar #

793

# The sound wakes the universe #

794
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:25,520
# Dragon will soar #

795
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:28,990
# High up, on high #

796
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,330
# I reach for high up, on high #

797
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,000
# Into the sky #

798
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,940
# I charge on into the sky #

799
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,010

824
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:04,610
