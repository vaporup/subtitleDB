1
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,493
- This is awesome.
- Oh, my God.

2
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,089
Oh, my God.
This is crazy.

3
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,533
Oh, my God!
So incredible.

4
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,034
Do you want
to know a secret?
I took a Viagra.

5
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,129
What?
This is awesome!

6
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,696
Why aren't l
using this every day?

7
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,903
What'd you do?
Wait. Stop, stop, stop.

8
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,104
Stop.
What?

9
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,710
What's the matter?

10
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,081
"What's the matter?"

11
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,382
You just took a Viagra
to have sex with me.

12
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,319
I thought it
would make it better.

13
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,084
It was better.
It takes some of
the pressure off.

14
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,222
Because you can't get
hard without a Viagra?

15
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,091
Is it because you
don't think I'm sexy?

16
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,653
I thought you'd
think it was fun

17
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,322
for me to
super-size it for once.

18
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:10,933
That is the worst
birthday present
you could ever give someone.

19
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,901
I was just trying to go
turbo for your birthday.

20
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,840
My hard-ons are
still in analog.
This shit's digital.

21
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,475
I don't want
a turbo penis.

22
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,179
I like your
medium-soft one.

23
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,880
Look, I can get it up.
Just not that far up.

24
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,380
Where did you get this?

25
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,646
I got it from Barry.

26
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,350
What?
You got it from Barry?

27
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,916
Why do you care?
This is my dick
we're talking about.

28
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:35,983
Not yours.

29
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,359
We are young people.

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,921
We don't need
medication to have sex.

31
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,933
I only took it
because it's your birthday.
I thought you'd like it.

32
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,867
Happy fucking 40th birthday.

33
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,801
I am not 40.

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,240
And I don't want
to have a husband

35
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,275
who has to take
Viagra to get a hard-on.

36
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,968
I don't have to
take it every time,
but once in a while.

37
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:57,176
Fuck 40.
Forty can suck my dick.

38
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,167
Stop it. Dad, stop.

39
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,830
I love you.

40
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,432
Time to get up.

41
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,601
Your breath
smells weird.

42
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,770
Wake up.

43
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,712
I really need
you to wake up.

44
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,675
Wake up. Come on.

45
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,085
Time to wake up.
Okay.

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,166
Whoo!

47
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,787
Ready!

48
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,600
Make a wish!

49
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,647
Hello, Sayid.

50
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,855
Can I watch Lost?

51
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,221
You can't handle Lost.

52
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,866
It's too violent,
and you won't understand.

53
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,994
If I don't understand it,
why can't I handle it?

54
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,095
Because you're eight.

55
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,573
I can handle it.
I've seen a shark eat
a guy on Shark Week.

56
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,835
Shark Week is fake.

57
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,409
No, it's not.

58
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,443
All of it is reenactments.

59
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,502
I know, but they...

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,947
And that's scary.
You shouldn't be
allowed to watch that.

61
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,976
They show the reenactments,
but they actually happened.

62
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,712
It's gonna give
you nightmares.

63
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,020
I can handle a nightmare.
You're a nightmare
every day for me.

64
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,418
Hey.

65
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,994
Don't eat that cupcake.

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,124
What?

67
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,725
The one you just
put into the sink.

68
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,467
I saw you were hiding that.

69
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,797
This cupcake?
You think I'm going
to eat this cupcake?

70
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,602
Yeah.
I so don't want
this cupcake. Look.

71
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,506
You're still going to eat it.
I'm going to eat
that cupcake?

72
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,908
Just put it in the trash.

73
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,469
What would you like to do?
Your choice.

74
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,544
Anything?
Yeah, anything.

75
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,547
Just hang out with you guys.

76
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,018
Don't you want
to get a massage,
or do something fun?

77
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,717
Forty's huge.

78
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,779
I'm turning 38.

79
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,758
Okay, 38. We will move on.

80
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,552
Isn't it weird
that our birthday
is the same week,

81
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,564
and then we're
going to have a party,
and it's just for me?

82
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,497
No, I don't think
it's weird at all.

83
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,829
Because you're turning
40 and I'm turning 38.

84
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,996
Come on,
do you really want to be
one of those ladies

85
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,563
who's just so
insecure about their age?

86
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,939
And they lie, and then they
gotta remember,
and it gets all...

87
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,407
You don't get it.
See, you don't
understand how it works.

88
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,946
I don't want to shop
at old ladies' stores.

89
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,744
I don't want to go
to J. Jill and Chico's,
and Ann Taylor Loft.

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,287
I'm not ready yet.

91
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,754
I need two more years.

92
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,519
That is so insane,
it kind of makes sense.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,084
What'd you get me
for my birthday?

94
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,322
Wait a minute,
I thought you said that

95
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,330
we shouldn't get each
other gifts this year.

96
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,729
What do you mean?

97
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,433
You're supposed to
get me a surprise gift.

98
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,267
This is a big birthday.

99
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,264
I'm turning 40.

100
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,941
Mom!

101
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,337
Mom, why can't I get
new clothes?

102
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,180
What the fuck?
Nothing fits me!

103
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,078
God damn it!

104
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,255
I'm going to go work out,
I'll be back in about an hour.

105
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,918
Hey, did your father call
to wish you a happy birthday?

106
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,688
No, but that's no surprise.

107
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,437
Come on.
Coming.

108
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,448
You got to keep up
with us, sweetheart.
Yeah, I'm in.

109
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,710
That's why your body
looks like your body

110
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,079
and her body
looks like her body.

111
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,754
Before, after.
Before, after.

112
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,124
You guys just
go on without me.
I'm just gonna...

113
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,750
I think I gotta...

114
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,152
Fuck.

115
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:43,126
Thanks for letting
me join this team.

116
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,260
It's not really a team.

117
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,861
It's just a bunch of guys
that get together and ride.

118
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,034
- I know, I know.
- Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

119
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,772
Hey! Bike lane, asshole!

120
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,205
It's always the guy in
the fucking lnfiniti.

121
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,814
Good. See,
you're getting tight here.
Yeah.

122
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,948
This, we need to work on.
Okay.

123
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,112
So, why on earth is
Pete taking Viagra?
What's going on?

124
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,314
I don't know.

125
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:09,352
I think maybe
he isn't attracted
to me anymore or something.

126
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,124
I don't know.
Well, that is ridiculous.

127
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,696
If you were my girlfriend,
I would not need a Viagra.

128
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,667
I would need
an anti-Viagra pill...

129
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,597
To try not to get a boner.

130
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,768
But everyone
gives you a boner.

131
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,033
Don't sell yourself
short like that.

132
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,700
You give me a boner.

133
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,073
Barb doesn't give me a boner.

134
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,742
Maybe things are
just getting stale.

135
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,943
That's why if maybe l
work out really hard...

136
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,245
Maybe he'll be able
to get a boner again.

137
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,586
Why do you need
to have sex, Deb?

138
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,815
Sex is the number one thing
people fight about.

139
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,419
You stop having sex,
there will be no more fights.

140
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,758
I am living proof.

141
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,189
I have no sex,

142
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,166
and I am the happiest
I have ever been.

143
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,766
I knew it. I knew you
were not having sex.

144
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,237
I can see it on your face.

145
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,001
It's all...

146
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,541
Puckered and pained.

147
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,544
I'm enjoying our
non-sex period,
that's all I'm saying.

148
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,803
Don't you miss it?

149
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,211
I wouldn't know, because
I don't have any
feeling down there anymore.

150
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,579
I have nerve damage
from my C-section,

151
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,048
so everything's
just kind of...

152
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,952
She's numb down there.

153
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,180
I could sit down
hard on a fire hydrant,

154
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,159
and I wouldn't even
know that I was sitting.

155
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,625
I could get stung by
a hornet down there,
and I would not feel it.

156
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,758
You could put
anything in there,

157
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,568
and I would not know
what the object was.

158
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,635
I used to pee
in a nice stream,

159
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,072
and now it just kind of goes
like a shower head.

160
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,870
That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

161
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,342
I think you need a family.
Don't you want a family?

162
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,378
No, I think
I want to Clooney it.

163
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,180
Clooney it?
Yup.

164
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,377
He doesn't seem happy.

165
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,141
Yeah, he is.

166
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,812
No, he's lonely.

167
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,947
No, he's not.

168
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,856
See, I think
he has sad eyes.

169
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,118
You sweet little thing, no.

170
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,426
He's doing sad, lonely eyes
to get the next lady.

171
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,591
Look, I can do it, too.
Watch.

172
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,828
I bet George Clooney
is really lonely.

173
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,964
Just him and his pig.

174
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,837
You'd fuck him.
I wouldn't.

175
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,069
So would you.
I would.

176
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,303
I wouldn't feel it,
but I would.

177
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,936
You'd fuck him
with your numb vagina.
Yes, you would.

178
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,806
Ocean's Thirteen Inches,
that's what you'd find out.

179
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,907
Do you think?

180
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,451
I mean,
that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

181
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,182
That's the one
thing you don't do,

182
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,451
is tell her that
you used Viagra.

183
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,288
I think that's even
on the warning label.

184
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,888
We're in one of
those phases where

185
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,458
everything that
the other person says

186
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,432
just annoys
the shit out of each other.

187
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,299
All the time. It's a blast.
Don't worry about it.

188
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,031
You just gotta
ride that out.

189
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,803
This sounds terrible.

190
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,501
Okay, I like it.

191
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,804
But...

192
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,408
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like if, say,

193
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,079
you were separated
by something bigger.

194
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,642
Like death? Like her death?

195
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,218
I have given it
a fair amount of thought.

196
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,886
Not in a painful way,
just quietly slid into death.

197
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,122
Like a gas leak.

198
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,026
Absolutely.
It's gotta be peaceful.

199
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,963
I mean, this is the mother
of your children.

200
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,761
You want her to die...

201
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,164
No, I'd want it
to be a peaceful...

202
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,533
...gentle, you know.

203
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,507
Yeah, just like drift
into a coma from which
she never awakens.

204
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,440
And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

205
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,770
That's just it,
people love widowers.

206
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,674
They love widowers.
It's like the polar
opposite of divorced guys.

207
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,738
It's the best.

208
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,512
It's like,
"Oh, that poor widower.

209
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,347
"lf I could only
make him happy."

210
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,990
"Somehow, ease his pain."

211
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,025
"Cock-suck
away his sadness."

212
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,304
Do you know that this song,
Pixies did this song,

213
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,399
it's about a Salvador Dali
short film called
Un Chien Andalusia.

214
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,205
This music doesn't
make people happy.

215
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,542
This song kicks off Doolittle,
one of the best albums
of the last 30 years.

216
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,081
Look how angry you get
while listening to it.

217
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,514
An important record.

218
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,109
It's my birthday.
You don't control
the radio on my birthday.

219
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,780
I do.

220
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,018
I control the radio
on my birthday.

221
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,263
Sadie's watching Lost.

222
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,138
Sadie, how many times
have you watched
Lostthis week?

223
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,742
I only watched 11.
But I have eight more,
and then I'm done, so...

224
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,677
How many are there?
114.

225
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:22,736
Are you kidding me?

226
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,716
You can't watch
over 100 episodes
of a show in five weeks.

227
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,013
It'll melt your brain.

228
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,781
It's not melting my brain,
it's blowing my mind.

229
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,585
That's really bad, Sadie.

230
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,558
You're not allowed to do that.

231
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,454
My relationship with Lost
is not your business.

232
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,827
It's extremely personal.

233
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,861
Stop!

234
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,965
Stop it.
Be nice to your sister.

235
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,368
You guys are going to
cherish each other one day.

236
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,931
Stop it! Stop!

237
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,971
It's your birthday.
You don't need to
go to the store.

238
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,207
No, just five minutes.
Desi and Jodi are fighting.

239
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,513
All right, five minutes,
but then I'm pulling you out.

240
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,443
Hi.

241
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,744
Hi.

242
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,652
How's Jodi treating you?

243
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,083
Jodi?

244
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,020
Oh, Jodi's my new BFF.

245
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,458
She's like a little kitty-cat.

246
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,189
Sometimes she comes
and rubs up against my leg.

247
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,195
And you're a ball of shit.

248
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,794
She loves me.

249
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,126
Huh.

250
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,170
Can you do inventory
so that we can do
the sidewalk sale?

251
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,643
And you really need
to pay attention
to the numbers

252
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:30,705
because we have
$12,000 unaccounted for.

253
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,045
I think it's probably Desi.

254
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,179
She's been having
a really hard time
using these simple computers.

255
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,552
It's because she's stupid.

256
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,283
I think she might be stealing.

257
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,527
She's not stealing.

258
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,793
She's our best employee.
She made nine
grand last month.

259
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,333
How much did I make?

260
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,630
You brought in $2,000.

261
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,794
That's not bad.

262
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,138
Well, it's not that good.

263
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,074
I mean, I'm not comparing you,
but you're not as good.

264
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,680
All right. See you.

265
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,514
I don't think she's
wearing underwear.

266
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,524
What?
It's all dark up there.

267
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,156
Why are you looking?

268
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,764
I didn't mean to look.

269
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,825
I just said, "Hey, whoa."
And there it was.

270
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,795
Maybe she's wearing
dark underwear.

271
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,909
Yeah, maybe she has underwear
that has a picture of
a vagina painted on it.

272
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,236
Stop looking.

273
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,812
Some deep oranges and browns,
and maybe some dark greens.

274
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,542
That would really
play up your features.

275
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,517
I'll just take out my AmEx
and you pick what
stuff you think's good.

276
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,380
Whoo!

277
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,620
Good job!

278
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,782
Whoo!

279
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,186
Where's Daddy?

280
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,854
I think he went to poop.

281
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,330
Pete!

282
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,796
Q-A-T.
Suck on that, bitch.

283
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,438
Hey.
What are you doing?

284
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,239
Going to the bathroom.

285
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,002
We're all downstairs,
waiting for you.

286
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,843
You've been up here
for a really long time now.

287
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,850
I'm almost done.
I'll be down in a second.

288
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,412
Charlotte just did
her first flip
on the trampoline

289
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,511
and she landed on her feet.

290
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,817
She was really
proud of herself.

291
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,155
That's great!
And you missed it.

292
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,624
She'll do it again.

293
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,389
It's the fourth time
you've gone to
the bathroom today.

294
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,856
Give me a break.

295
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,565
Why is your instinct
to escape?

296
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,397
It's not my instinct
to escape from you.

297
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,028
It is my instinct to
come into the bathroom

298
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,764
when I need to go
to the bathroom.

299
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,434
How come I don't
smell anything?

300
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,635
It's because I shoved
an Altoid up my ass
before I came in here.

301
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,872
Let me see, then.

302
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,412
What?
Let me see.

303
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,641
No, I'm not going
to let you see.

304
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,774
You're not
going to let me see,

305
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,839
because you're
not taking a poop.

306
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,680
I've been flushing as I go.

307
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,186
You're flushing as you go.

308
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,481
Who takes a half-hour
to go to the bathroom?

309
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,751
John Goodman.

310
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,094
Don't press "Enter."
I'm not sure I want
to make that move!

311
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,922
Thank you. Wow.

312
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,231
You know, when I
first started this label,

313
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,295
my dream was to work
with musicians and bands

314
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,603
whose music
I just admired so much.

315
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,175
The person that I thought,
"My God, wouldn't it be
incredible to work with, "

316
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,269
was Graham Parker.

317
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,050
Tonight, we have him, solo

318
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,221
because we couldn't afford
to fly in The Rumour.

319
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,822
Graham Parker.

320
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,665
It's just not
my kind of music.

321
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,176
Really? What is
your kind of music?

322
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,637
I like Lady Gaga.

323
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,681
Oh, God, of course you do.

324
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,443
What?
Shallow dance music.

325
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,217
It's not. It is fun.

326
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,312
And it's about
release and sex and power.

327
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,654
You don't have to like it.
It's really not for you,
that's fine.

328
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,354
This is a job.
This is not a hobby.

329
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,420
Can't you love him,
just as a hobby

330
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,463
and sign a 15-year-old
hot girl so we can eat?

331
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,402
Graham Parker & The Rumour
had two albums

332
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,441
in the Rolling Stone Top 500
Best Albums of All Time.

333
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,497
Two of them.

334
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:55,146
If I can just
sell 10,000 records
to his hardcore fanbase,

335
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,238
we're golden.

336
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,187
The last of Graham
Parker's fans just died.

337
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,792
I do know. Hardly.
That sort of music
depresses people.

338
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,300
Hi, Charlotte.

339
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,166
Sadie. Sadie,
what are you listening to?

340
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,869
Okay. This is music
that makes people happy.

341
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,405
And this is what people buy.

342
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,141
What?

343
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,017
Right, girls?

344
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,075
Come on, Sadie.

345
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,501
Okay.

346
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,106
Why did you take it off?

347
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,211
Now, something
that really rocks.

348
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,143
This is called good music.

349
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,082
From somebody's heart.

350
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,983
This is bumming me out.
This isn't fun.

351
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,050
Just listen to
these words, okay?
Just listen to the words.

352
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,528
I don't understand the words.

353
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,295
This is lyrics.
This is poetry.

354
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,097
This is what is
going to survive
in a hundred years.

355
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,297
It just doesn't
make people happy.

356
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,531
Makes me happy.
I can dance to it.

357
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,079
But you're the only one
in the room who's happy.

358
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,727
Sometimes I wish just
one of you had a dick.

359
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,288
Well, we don't want one.

360
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,101
Is there something
that you can do
to be helping me right now?

361
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,301
Yeah, I'm ready to help.
Just tell me what to do.

362
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,739
Can you go get
a lunch box or something?

363
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:09,972
For me or for them?

364
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,315
Charlotte!
I've got a test!

365
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,045
I'm coming, I'm coming.

366
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,956
Charlotte,
I'm going to kill you!

367
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,020
Hi, Debbie.

368
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,393
Hi. Any day now, huh?

369
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,261
Not really.
Three months, still.

370
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,826
Hi.
Hi.

371
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,369
Katie's dying for a play date.
Let's hook these two up.

372
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,666
That would be great.
Okay, I'll call you.
Great.

373
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:34,831
Okay, great.

374
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:35,896
No.

375
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,236
No, what?
No.

376
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,833
What?
No.

377
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:39,966
She's sweet.

378
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,410
She's evil.

379
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,576
Hello. Hi.
Hi.

380
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,017
Listen, Charlotte
really needs to get
here on time

381
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,986
because she needs
the extra time
to just settle in.

382
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,053
Oh. We are on time.

383
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,258
Being on time
means being early.

384
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:55,951
Okay.

385
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,622
It's nice to see you in class.
We'd like to see more of you.

386
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,556
I come to...

387
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,427
Hi, Debbie.

388
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,559
Grandma Molly.

389
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,605
How are you?
I'm so happy about
the science fair.

390
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,869
Thank you for coming.
It's going very well, I heard.

391
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,468
Yeah.
I love you.
You look so beautiful!

392
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,643
Happy birthday.
I just learned
that you're 40.

393
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,047
Are you 40?

394
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,776
Yeah.

395
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,814
I remember when I was 40,
and then I blinked,

396
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,413
and there I was,
going to be 90.

397
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,720
My God, where did it go?

398
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,986
One day, you're going to blink
and you're going to be 90.

399
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,328
And I won't be
around to see it,
and that makes me very sad.

400
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,125
I'm telling you.
I'm warning you.

401
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,962
Don't blink. Don't blink.

402
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,249
And then you missed
the mortgage payment,

403
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,909
and that's
the second mortgage.

404
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,477
You gotta tighten your belt.
You gotta go home, sit down,

405
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,422
Iook at your expenses,
come clean with Debbie.

406
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,219
Oh, God.
I can't tell Debbie.

407
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,487
You've got to tell her, Pete.

408
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,325
I mean, she knows it's bad,
but she has no
idea just how bad.

409
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,195
If you sell the house,
it'll really
buy you some time.

410
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,530
No, Debbie's not really
into selling the house.

411
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,162
As your business manager
and your friend,
I can't recommend that.

412
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,135
Hey, how funny would it be
if I bought your house?

413
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,370
Okay. Bye.

414
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,911
Hang in there.

415
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,083
From the retro label,
Unfiltered,

416
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:33,318
comes the first
Graham Parker & The Rumour
record in 30 years.

417
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:38,258
When we play together,
the magic was just ridiculous.

418
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,594
And I think what we've
got is just so great.

419
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,558
What are you doing?

420
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,228
I'm contextualizing him
as one of the great
figures in rock history.

421
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,468
You can't show him
in his prime in '77,

422
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,271
and then jump
straight to him
as he is now.

423
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,538
It's terrifying.

424
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,874
You have got to reverse it.
You have got to show him

425
00:21:55,947 --> 00:22:00,179
as he is now, very briefly,
and then show him in 1977.

426
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,617
You have got to
Benjamin Button it.

427
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,483
I don't know what
you're talking about.
All rock stars are older now.

428
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,150
Steven Tyler,
David Bowie,
Mick Jagger...

429
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,419
Paul McCartney.
Okay. Stop it.

430
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,724
Everybody that
you are mentioning
looks like an old woman now.

431
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,430
You're just mentioning
a bunch of Jessica Tandys.

432
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,759
Keith Richards
gets away with it.

433
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,996
But that's
because Keith Richards
looked 70 when he was 40.

434
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,666
And now that he's 70,
he looks 69.

435
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,801
He's regenerating.

436
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,807
I like it, and I think
Graham Parker's sexy.

437
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,237
Well, would you fuck him?

438
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,947
Yes.
You'd...

439
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,913
You'd fuck him and
you won't fuck me?

440
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,708
I mean, I kind of
fucked you once,

441
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,777
if you could
have finished.
Oh. I finished.

442
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,790
Okay, enough of
who fucked who
and who finished what.

443
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,153
I finished.

444
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,456
Look, it's a retro label.
That's our niche,
that's our market.

445
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,396
It costs money to
break new bands.
I can't do that.

446
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,764
Okay, and also,
you're the guy who
turned down Arcade Fire.

447
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,368
Everybody turned
down Arcade Fire.

448
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,869
It's crazy.
There's so many of them.

449
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,269
We don't have the money
to market a new band.

450
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,369
We just need to make
Graham seem relevant.

451
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,965
Who's he talking to?

452
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,237
The Jewish Journal.

453
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,206
The Jewish Journal?

454
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,808
Apparently, old Jews
are the only ones who still
buy hard copy of records.

455
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,847
Because they don't
like to download music.

456
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,319
Because they don't know
what "downloading" means.

457
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,324
Why is this album
different from
any other album?

458
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,153
It isn't.

459
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,418
What is he wearing?

460
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,197
It's a hat with
the Oreo logo on it.

461
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,360
Why?
I don't think
he's being ironic.

462
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,661
I think he just
really likes Oreos.

463
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,570
Look, Paul Westerberg
record did okay.

464
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,172
Frank Black record
did all right.

465
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,707
The Haircut One Hundred,
not so much.

466
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,209
We have to break
this record. Otherwise,
we're not here next year.

467
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,140
He's coming, he's coming.
Oreo Man is coming.

468
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,304
Hey, guys, how are you?

469
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,438
Good, man.

470
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,210
Aren't cookies the best?
Yeah.

471
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,151
Jewish Journal guy
loves the record.

472
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,243
Great!

473
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,686
Got a bit of
a problem, though.
A touch of gout.

474
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,381
Gout?

475
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,016
My whole family,
they all had gout.

476
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,722
Jesus.
That's very unfortunate.

477
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,994
My auntie Queenie,
she had a foot like this.

478
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,967
It's like a size
of a small pig.
I've got a photo of it.

479
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,570
I'd love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

480
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,297
And a couple of
bunions as well.

481
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,398
Fuck.

482
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,033
I've got to go
to the podiatrist,

483
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,702
and I hope he can
shoot me up with something.

484
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,178
Yeah, well, let's get
you to the podiatrist.

485
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,110
Bye, Graham.
See you later, Graham.

486
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,614
Good luck with your gout.

487
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,050
Rock and roll, baby.

488
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,414
The happiest period
in people's lives
is from age 40 to 60.

489
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,655
So, this is it.
We're in it right now.

490
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,456
It's true.
Says who?

491
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,226
Says a lot of people.
Most people say that.
Oh!

492
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,328
We have everything
we need right now
to be completely happy.

493
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,607
We're going to blink,
and be 90.
What?

494
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,269
So, let's just
choose to be happy.

495
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,168
Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,440
Your eyes are
kind of glazing over.

497
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,141
No, I'm processing it all.

498
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,611
Some of these,
I wrote for you.

499
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,650
So, we have to
exercise every day.
Mmm.

500
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,517
Spend more time
alone together.

501
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,748
And we have to go
to the therapist, every week.

502
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,221
It's a little pricey.

503
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,055
No stressing over tiny things.

504
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,959
Yeah, that's good.
You should do that.
Mm-hmm.

505
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,998
We have to get more
involved in school.

506
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,298
Yeah.
Have more
patience with the kids.

507
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,270
And we need to
work on our anger.

508
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,805
Yeah, I think it would be
good if you could take
care of your anger.

509
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,167
No, I said both of us.

510
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,402
That's what I said.
Our anger.

511
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,174
Okay, and no more smoking.

512
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,544
Yeah, you gotta
cut that out.

513
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,344
I don't want to make
this about a fight.
I want to just be positive.

514
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,108
Yeah. Sorry.

515
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,123
Okay, and then no more
holding onto resentments.

516
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,216
We have to just let that go.

517
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,954
So, you're saying
that if we're arguing,

518
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,756
and I apologize,
you'll let it go?

519
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,195
And not throw it
back in my face later?

520
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,457
Well, I don't do that,

521
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,197
but I will continue
not to do that.

522
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,635
And what did you write?

523
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,772
All of that.
That's plenty.
That's a lot.

524
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,372
And you're going
to eat better?

525
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,605
Oh, yeah.
I've been doing
a decent job.

526
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,147
But I don't think
there's anything wrong

527
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,749
with having some
fries every now and again.

528
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,348
And then I'll smoke that day.

529
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,743
That's not the same thing.
It is the same thing.

530
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,979
I like fries.

531
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,323
And the other thing
is your dad's stuff,

532
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,690
the not letting him
guilt-trip you all the time

533
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,821
because that puts a lot
of pressure on you,
and stress,

534
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,558
and then
the whole family feels it.

535
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,862
And he is a grown man,
and he's not our
responsibility.

536
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,402
And you're not giving him
money anymore, right?

537
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,499
No. No, I haven't
been giving him money.

538
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,973
I haven't done that
for years. I told you.

539
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,469
Can you please put that down?

540
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,573
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

541
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,447
You sure you don't want
to just do a joint
birthday party?

542
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,508
No.

543
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,747
We always used to.
No.

544
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,553
Did Jodi tell you she
thinks Desi's stealing?

545
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,454
Are you serious?

546
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,791
How much?
$12,000.

547
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,822
Oh, God.

548
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,123
And Desi's taking it?

549
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,359
Well, I don't know.

550
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,731
That's what Jodi said.

551
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,762
We really need
the store to work.

552
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,504
It is.

553
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,637
Don't put that kind
of pressure on me.

554
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,473
No, no. It's not
what I mean. I'm just...

555
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,509
Are you nervous
about money?

556
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,316
Are we okay?

557
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,079
Yeah.
All right.

558
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,953
Maybe we just suck it up
because she's clearly

559
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,456
earning so much more
than any other
employee we have.

560
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,749
Oh, yeah, for sure.
We can't fire her.

561
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,793
We're barely
breaking even with her.

562
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,090
That's why we
have to keep her.

563
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,426
Look at this.
She's making
out with somebody.

564
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,061
Is she screwing him?

565
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,102
That might be
like a dry hump.

566
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,335
Look at the position
of her skirt.

567
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,809
That's too grainy
to know for sure.

568
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,541
Oh, my God. This is in
the middle ofthe day.
Customers could be in there.

569
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,982
At least
she's getting some.

570
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,249
What did you say?
"At least she's getting some"?

571
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,821
Yes.

572
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,324
What are you talking about?
We had sex the other night.

573
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,792
You gotta give me
a little credit for that.

574
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,988
It's not about credit.
It's about...

575
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,998
We need to have
more passion.

576
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,359
Like this.

577
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,232
That's not passionate.

578
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,963
It looks
passionate to me.

579
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,265
What?

580
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,939
What is she doing?
Okay.

581
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,035
Oh, my God.

582
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,837
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh.

583
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,548
Don't do that.
What am I doing?

584
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,517
Don't fart in the bed.

585
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,315
I'm not. It's the springs.

586
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,152
This is why
we never have sex.

587
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,249
That's disgusting,
you're gross.

588
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,850
I don't know what
you're talking about.

589
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,553
You're so...

590
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,858
God!

591
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,793
Sadie, Sadie,
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie

592
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,564
Charlotte,
I'm doing my homework.

593
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,070
Okay, watch this.
Watch this.

594
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,171
There's a haunted cow
back here.

595
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:35,645
I'm pretty sure
it does not have milk.

596
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,211
Moo.

597
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,447
Moo!

598
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,380
See that?
They took me away.

599
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,390
You're no fun.
You never want to play.

600
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,897
Charlotte, how many times
do I have to tell you?

601
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,025
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie

602
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,329
Sadie is boring

603
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,780
You're so mean
since your body
got weird.

604
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,885
Close the door.

605
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,582
You're no fun.

606
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,144
If you can just move
just a little bit more.

607
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,709
Oh, shit.

608
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,943
Okay, okay.
Ah!

609
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,619
Ow. Ow.

610
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:27,850
No, my boob is in there!

611
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,926
Did I tell you
that my son's
going to Stanford?

612
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,157
No, that's great.
Great for us,
and great for him.

613
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,289
Cough again.
Great school.

614
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,493
Everything looks good.

615
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,537
Your face is close
to my face.

616
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,768
Descending colon.

617
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,539
I'm about four
feet in right now.

618
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,703
That's what he said.

619
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,679
Are you a grinder?
Do you grind your teeth?

620
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,681
I grind all night.

621
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,309
Oh!

622
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,183
I think we need to
turn the gas down.

623
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,682
Turn it up!

624
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,252
No, we're going to
turn it down.

625
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,793
Turn it up!

626
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,864
Ooh!

627
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,461
Do you have to breathe
right on my neck?

628
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,733
Sorry.

629
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,002
What are you all
doing for Christmas?

630
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,338
Um, I don't know.

631
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,838
You have a tree
and everything?
Mm-hmm.

632
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,177
Isn't that fun?
In the spirit?

633
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,807
Sorry, I just had
one quick question.

634
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,352
On your form,
you said you
were born in 1974,

635
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,547
but your paper, it said '72.
So I just need to
know which it is.

636
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,783
It's 1974.

637
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,484
Oh, wait.
Because on your last form,

638
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,722
you said that you
were born in 1975.

639
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,490
Didn't you tell me
you were born in 1976?

640
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,600
No.
That's funny.

641
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,928
So, you want to
go with 1974?

642
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,598
I'm not gonna "go with" 1974.
It is 1974.

643
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,267
Okay.

644
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,037
Just remember to write
"1974" every time.

645
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,610
It's okay. It's 1976.

646
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,182
I lie about my age, okay?

647
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,514
Okay.
Okay? Okay? Okay?

648
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,147
Okay.
Okay.

649
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:08,984
You're tightening up.

650
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,459
Oh, my gosh.

651
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:15,094
I know how old you are
by counting the rings.

652
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,656
A little gyno joke.

653
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,436
Oh, my God. Please.

654
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,873
What are you doing?

655
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,737
Getting ready to
go for my ride.

656
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,978
You want a blow job?

657
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,017
Yeah. Why?

658
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,518
I really want
a cigarette right now.

659
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,110
Wow, happy to help.

660
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,647
Charlotte,
where is my backpack?

661
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,486
Hello?

662
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,359
Mom's busy!

663
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,057
Why are you
locking the door?

664
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,962
Mom, what's going on
in there?

665
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,659
Mom, I can't be late
for school. I have a test.

666
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,793
Mommy can't talk
right now!

667
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,303
This isn't funny, Mom.
I need to go!

668
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,033
Mom, let me in!
Please!

669
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,597
That's not gonna help!

670
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,734
Put on your shoes.
We'll meet you in the car.

671
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,601
Ow. Sadie hurt me!
I didn't!

672
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,146
So, hit her back!

673
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,304
She's faking.

674
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,214
I'm not!
Go downstairs!

675
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,274
Please! Sadie gave me a...

676
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,116
Stop crying!
Stop crying!

677
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,450
Stop it!
God damn it!

678
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,149
Quit killing each other!
Mom, please come out.

679
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,022
Shut up!
Stop it!

680
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,153
- Open the door!
- Go away!

681
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,397
Open it up!
Please!

682
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,557
Forget it.

683
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,396
No, don't forget it,
don't forget it.
Don't, don't...

684
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,494
Oh, God.

685
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,031
Hey, boychik!

686
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:31,966
Hey!

687
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,873
It's the 11:00
from London.

688
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,885
Drop something valuable,
you shit!

689
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,320
How you doing?
How are you, bubeleh?

690
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,755
That's loud.
Every eight minutes, buddy.

691
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,852
You look pretty good.
Your hair is different.

692
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,393
Yeah, I'm growing it out.

693
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,159
I'd get it cut.

694
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,527
Daddy, you never
play with me.

695
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,626
I do, but right now,
look who I'm talking to.

696
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,064
Hi.
It's your brother!

697
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:05,140
Hi.
You don't look
like my brother.

698
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:09,009
I told you, honey,
that's because
of the egg donor.

699
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,580
Remember?
I came from a test tube!

700
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,620
How's business?
It's not good.

701
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,580
Nobody wants curtains.

702
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,821
They think of it
like a luxury.
It's not a luxury.

703
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,358
You need shade.
You need privacy.

704
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,391
Who wants to have
other people watch you fuck?

705
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,665
I know how you feel.

706
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,099
My business is going through
some growing pains right now.

707
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,260
Daddy!
Daddy!

708
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,463
Don't jump on Daddy.
Be careful,
don't jump on Daddy!

709
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,630
Remember,
Daddy has high blood what?

710
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,141
High blood pressure.

711
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,007
That's right.
My daddy's old.

712
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,979
Can you go outside
without me for a little bit?

713
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,613
Yeah.
Don't go near
that little pool!

714
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,014
All right?
We're going to
pee in the pool.

715
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,610
Do The Three Stooges routine
you were practicing.

716
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,880
I can't tell them apart.

717
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,720
I swear to God,
I need tattoos.

718
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,854
Look, I wanted to
talk to you about

719
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,658
scaling back a little bit.

720
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,896
You know, Deb and I are...
We're thinking about
selling the house.

721
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,732
I think that house
is more than you need.

722
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,331
I think it was too big
of a purchase
when you made it.

723
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,342
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'm going to have
to make some changes.

724
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,508
I'm going to
have to cut back.

725
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,945
I understand.
What do you mean?

726
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,776
With you.
Oh.

727
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,943
I'm sorry. What?

728
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,055
I can't lend you
any more money.

729
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,886
No, that's a bad idea.
That's not the way
to cut back.

730
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,922
I have three children here.

731
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,256
What about Claire?
Can't she get a job?

732
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,194
Claire takes care
of your brothers!

733
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,626
What do you want
her to do?

734
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,726
If she goes to work,
then I gotta hire somebody!

735
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,030
Well, you've got to
figure something out

736
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,969
because I can't do it.
I can't do it.

737
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,500
Okay, fine.
Why don't we kill them?

738
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,169
Come on,
we'll kill two of them.

739
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,642
I'll keep the best one.

740
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,542
Really, it'll save us
both a lot of trouble.

741
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,137
Come on.
Line up!

742
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,341
Line up for murder! Come on!

743
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,381
Who wants to be killed?
I do!

744
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,820
Okay, we're eliminating
one already.
We're cheaper. You're gone.

745
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,448
Murder me.
Okay. Boom. Dead!

746
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,220
I'm dead!
You're dead! You're dead!

747
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,158
Kill me, kill me!
All right,
the kids are murdered.

748
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,490
That will save us some money.
Daddy is the best!

749
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,522
Why would you have
three kids, anyway?

750
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,429
I mean, you're 60 years old.
You have no money.

751
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,798
Because Claire wanted a baby.

752
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,295
If we didn't at least try,
she would have left me.

753
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,808
She was 45 years old.
Nobody thought it would take.

754
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,105
The doctor,
when we're doing in vitro,
is winking at me like...

755
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,735
"Don't worry, don't worry."

756
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,208
We were very unlucky.

757
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,306
And now,
we have these three
beautiful children.

758
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,477
Come on. I gotta
tell you something.

759
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,614
What?

760
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,955
Your mother
wanted you aborted.

761
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,293
Oh. Jesus Christ.

762
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,334
No, no. It's the truth.

763
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,028
You know, it was the '70s.
We were 22 years old.

764
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,835
That's what everybody did.
You did some blow,
had sex, had an abortion.

765
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,439
Really?
Yes.

766
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,444
We were on the way to
the doctor's office.

767
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,174
I said, "Let's stop,
have a pizza, talk about it.

768
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,115
"lf you still wanna
do it after lunch,
it's okay."

769
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,344
The pizza saved your life.

770
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,787
But don't give me money,
because I'm not worth it.

771
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,785
So, how much
do I owe you
for saving my life?

772
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,521
I don't have a number.
You just keep giving
like you're giving.

773
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,585
Hey. Oh, hi, Pete.

774
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,721
Hey.
Hey.

775
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,992
Why aren't you
playing with the kids?

776
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,829
We were playing
all day with them.

777
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,997
Pete is just talking to me
about his 40th birthday party.

778
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,595
Whatever I can do to help.

779
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,004
Okay. Did you feed them?

780
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,633
I fed half of one.

781
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,041
Half of...

782
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,079
Let's go, we'll feed them.
Mommy will feed them.

783
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,706
Who wants tuna with
a side ofjet fuel?

784
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,980
Hi, I'm looking for my dad.
I mean, an older man.

785
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,529
So, how's Sony treating Pete?

786
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,742
He's not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

787
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,207
Now he's able to
focus on the artists

788
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,077
that he's really
passionate about.

789
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,307
Hmm.

790
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,045
How's Sadie doing?

791
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,417
The last time I saw her,
she was throwing her
Cheerios on the floor.

792
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,887
What a mess.

793
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,218
Right.

794
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,916
She just got her period.

795
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,426
Well, I guess she's not
a little baby anymore.

796
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,401
It would be nice to
see more of each other.

797
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,369
Well, we can
certainly arrange for that.
I'd love to see the girls.

798
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,170
That would be nice.
Mm-hmm. It would.

799
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,847
Do you have a day
that is better...
A good day?

800
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,583
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

801
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,679
Soccer competitions,
kids' exams.

802
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,983
Right, right.
I mean, we're both so busy.

803
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,685
I have young children,
you have young children.

804
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,354
I don't think we should
judge ourselves too
harshly about that.

805
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,395
I know, I wasn't...
I didn't say anything.

806
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:00,597
No, I'm glad we're here.
I think this is a good start.

807
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,198
And then, we can spend
more time together,
it'd be nice.

808
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,706
It'd be nice.

809
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,008
Do you want to see
pictures of the kids?

810
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,773
Oh. Yeah.

811
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:19,145
This is Kel, my son.

812
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:23,390
He's handsome. He's 13?
Mm-hmm.

813
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:28,694
And that's Alexandra,
my daughter.
She's a real perfectionist.

814
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,724
A lot like you.

815
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,060
That's the whole gang at Cabo.

816
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,670
Excuse me, dear,
I gotta go to the restroom.

817
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,771
Be right back.
Okay.

818
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,111
Daddy and I are
making some changes

819
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,171
so that we can be
happier and healthier.

820
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,579
And we're starting with
this meal that I prepared.

821
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,911
I think it looks great.
Doesn't it look good?

822
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,148
What is that,
grilled cheeses?

823
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,682
No, baked tofu.
Oh.

824
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,448
It's actually really tasty.

825
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,722
And the lettuce is
so fresh and tasty

826
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,254
that you forget how good
lettuce tastes on its own,

827
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,799
without dressing.

828
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,060
No, dressing always
gets in the way of the
natural taste of the lettuce.

829
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,272
And another
thing we've decided

830
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,969
is to cut back on
all of the electronics we use.

831
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,871
Basically,
what we're going to do,
is get rid of the Wi-Fi

832
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,813
and only use the computer...

833
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,977
What?
...from 8:00
to 8:30 at night.

834
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,384
How are we gonna
go on the computer?

835
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,855
We're gonna have
a hard line in the kitchen.

836
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,516
Yeah. We'll supervise that.

837
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,254
You can't do this.
You can't take away
the Wi-Fi.

838
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,728
No Wi-Fi!
A-ha-ha.

839
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,526
You don't spend
enough time with the family

840
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,501
when you're constantly
on your iPhone
and your computer.

841
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,006
And, you know, you're only
here for five more years.

842
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,904
So, you won't see
me after five years?

843
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,409
No, but you won't
be living with us.

844
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,207
And you should get to
know your little sister.

845
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,243
You've got
the perfect friend,
right here.

846
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,215
I don't wanna be
friends with her now.

847
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,548
I'll be friends with her when
she's 20 and a normal person.

848
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,350
I don't wanna hang out
with her when I'm in my 20s.

849
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,788
You're on the computer
too much as it is.

850
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,656
You need to get outside more,
do some playing outside.

851
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,696
Yeah, you could build things.
You could build
a fort outside.

852
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,994
What?
Yeah, build a fort.

853
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,500
Play with your
friends and have...

854
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,298
Make a fort? Outside?

855
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,729
And do what?

856
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,603
Do what in the fort?

857
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,838
When I was a kid,
we used to build tree houses
and play with sticks.

858
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,544
Nobody plays with sticks.

859
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,309
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

860
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,607
Play kick the can.

861
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
Look for dead bodies.

862
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,786
It's fun. That's fun to do.

863
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,545
Get a tire and then
just take a stick and
run down a street with it.

864
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,320
Nobody does that crap.
It's 2012.

865
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,917
You don't need technology.

866
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,622
No technology!

867
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,788
Charlotte, put that down.

868
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:18,096
I don't need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

869
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,499
I don't do anything bad.

870
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,935
Nobody said you were bad.

871
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,563
I don't do things
I'm not supposed to.

872
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,301
I don't illegally
download music.

873
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,206
I don't look at
porn like Wendy.

874
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,403
She is up to no good.
She's not allowed
to come over here anymore.

875
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,469
What's porn?

876
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,606
No, she said "corn."

877
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,980
This isn't turning out
the way I wanted it to.

878
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,143
I'm not hungry.

879
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,416
No computer.
Listen to your mom.

880
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,952
I need to use it
for my homework.

881
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,456
She's outplaying us.

882
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,592
I know. She's tough.

883
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,025
This is the best
birthday present.

884
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,160
It's good to get away.

885
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,829
We haven't been to Laguna
without the kids in years.

886
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,930
I know.
If we're happy,
they're happy.

887
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,134
Yeah, I mean,
I can't take it.

888
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,370
With the hormones,
and the crying.

889
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,242
Jesus.
And "do my homework."

890
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,508
Them's lil' bitches.

891
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,109
Them's lil' bitches.
Bugging us for
shit all the time.

892
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,449
And they never
appreciate anything.

893
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,456
No! God, no.
They're selfish assholes.

894
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:18,120
Aw, I feel bad.
I love them.

895
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,219
I know.

896
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,890
I miss them already.
Should we go home?

897
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,458
Nah.

898
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,202
Why do we fight?

899
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,608
I don't know,
it makes no sense.

900
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,941
It makes no sense.

901
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,807
When we get in a fight,

902
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,976
Iook at my eyes and let's
remember this moment,
right now,

903
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,610
and know that we
never have to fight.

904
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,816
But you're such
a dick sometimes.

905
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,220
I know, I am a dick sometimes.

906
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,651
People think I'm so nice,
but I'm such a dick.

907
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,093
Thank you for admitting that.

908
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,923
And you get so mad at me,
I feel like you
want to kill me.

909
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,690
I do want to kill you.

910
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,093
How would you do it?

911
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,227
I don't know. I'd poison you.

912
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,403
I'd poison your cupcakes
that you pretend
not to eat every day.

913
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,272
And just put enough in
to just slowly weaken you.

914
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,368
I love it.

915
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,379
I would enjoy our
last few months together.
Me too.

916
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,047
Because you'd be
so weak and sweet.

917
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,947
And I could
take care of you...

918
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,382
But while killing you.

919
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,487
See, you know
what I love about us?

920
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,045
You can still surprise me.

921
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,251
I figured,
for sure, you'd knock me out
with one fell swoop of poison.

922
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,590
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

923
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,563
Have you ever
thought about killing me?

924
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,656
Oh, yeah.
Really?

925
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:03,757
Sure.

926
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,131
How would you do it?
Wood chipper.

927
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,702
A wood chipper?
Yeah.

928
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,896
A wood chipper.

929
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,029
Yeah.

930
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,232
Wow.

931
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,638
I know. Did you see Fargo?

932
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,733
Yeah.

933
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,470
Ugh.

934
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,547
That's a bad plan.
The cupcakes is
a way better plan.

935
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:19,809
It is. You're right.

936
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,612
You know what?
I won't murder you.

937
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,980
Aw!

938
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,881
I love you.

939
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,483
I love you, too.

940
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,618
Do you know what I brought?
What?

941
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,284
A medical marijuana cookie.
Ben gave it to
me last Christmas.

942
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,520
What?

943
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,618
Yeah. I brought it.
You did?

944
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:34,721
Chocolate chip kooky.

945
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:35,787
Should we do it?

946
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,867
Let's eat the cookie
and then we'll order
a bunch of cheeseburgers.

947
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,699
Let's order the entire
room service menu.

948
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:44,240
Just get all of it.
You deserve it,
you really do.

949
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,931
Wouldn't you
rather have me around

950
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,069
for less years
and I'm incredibly happy,
than longer and miserable?

951
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,081
Yes, and I just
realized that right now.

952
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,343
Go get the cookie.
I'm getting the cookie.

953
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,884
Go get the cookie.

954
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,144
Ow!

955
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,878
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

956
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,483
Yeah. Should we
get a block of porn?

957
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,852
I don't think we
need 24 hours of porn.

958
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,487
But you know, two porns
costs just about as much
as a 24-hour block.

959
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,195
I think that's
too much porn.

960
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,890
We don't have to watch it all,
but for the value,
it makes sense.

961
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,064
How much are we
supposed to eat?

962
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,231
I don't know.
I think six or
seven cookies, right?

963
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,008
Plus, it's old,
it probably has
lost some of its...

964
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,768
Potency.

965
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,174
We should have sex more.

966
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,306
I mean,
girls have it so easy.

967
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,785
You just show up
with your sexual organs
and you're good to go.

968
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,082
All the pressure
is on the guy.

969
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,180
It's true.

970
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,226
And I look at guys...
Like, I look at a guy
like Prince,

971
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,624
and you know that guy fucks.

972
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:38,752
Yeah.

973
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,127
I know I don't
fuck like Prince.
Uh-uh.

974
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,493
Prince can fuck.
Uh-huh.

975
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,294
I fuck like David Schwimmer.

976
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,733
You do.

977
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,733
You know, I fuck
like Ross from Friends.

978
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,349
Mmm.

979
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,481
Looks good.

980
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:05,882
How does he do it?

981
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,048
The floating spoon.

982
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,387
Check it out.
It's my dick and balls.

983
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,560
Oh, my God.
I don't eat my own dick.

984
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,463
I ate my dick!

985
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,135
Kelly, I think
this room has rodents.

986
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,503
There! Just saw it.

987
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,738
Have you seen my starfish?

988
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,236
Where did I put my starfish?

989
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:30,437
My God.

990
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,310
I'm gonna deep
throat this éclair.

991
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:35,846
I wanna make out
with you so bad.

992
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,917
I felt like
I was gonna choke!

993
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,651
That was nice.

994
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,284
That was nice.

995
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,622
Mom, Charlotte's crying

996
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,291
because she's got
an ear infection again.

997
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,301
I didn't know
what to do.

998
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,300
We're home.

999
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,236
Are you okay?

1000
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,704
What's the matter?

1001
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,746
I wanna rip my ear off,
it hurts so much.

1002
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,345
I told you that pediatrician
didn't know what
he was talking about.

1003
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,519
Come on, you can't
blame it on our doctor.

1004
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,111
Ear infections are
common in little kids.

1005
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,688
Not in kids
over six years old.

1006
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,988
We're going to
the Eastern doctor.

1007
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,187
If she's in this much pain,
then we should
call a real doctor.

1008
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,053
Are you kidding
right now?

1009
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,292
I know. Okay. Yup.

1010
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,705
What we should do
is easy and simple.

1011
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,340
No more dairy,
no more wheat,
no more sugar.

1012
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,769
Sugar, wheat
and dairy. Okay.
Yeah.

1013
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,435
What the fuck is left?

1014
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,673
Sorry.

1015
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,249
Isn't everything sugar,
wheat, and dairy?

1016
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,280
She can have
vegetables and fruits.

1017
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,111
Oh, but she can eat fruits.

1018
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:18,684
Fruits. Yeah.

1019
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,083
Any kind of fruit?

1020
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,586
Mangos, pineapple.

1021
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,090
It isn't,
there are safe fruits

1022
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,151
and then there
are unsafe fruits?
No, no.

1023
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,623
What about French fries?

1024
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,387
Could we do
something like that?
Are you okay?

1025
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,429
Would you like to
come on the table?
I'm okay, I'm...

1026
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:31,895
Why don't you go
on the table?

1027
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,129
I don't wanna go
on the table.

1028
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,465
No. It looks like you
need to get on the table.

1029
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,664
I don't wanna
get on the table.

1030
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,037
Pete!

1031
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,683
God damn it.

1032
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,616
What are you doing?

1033
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:56,724
I need you to look at
something. In my butt.

1034
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,621
Why?

1035
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,426
I think I got
something in there,

1036
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:05,399
and I'm not
limber enough to see.

1037
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,630
I need you to look
at it, all right?

1038
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,934
I think I might have an
anal fissure, or a hemorrhoid,
or a worm or something.

1039
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,335
What are you
doing with your phone?

1040
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,075
I'm trying to take pictures
of it so I can compare it
to something on Google.

1041
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:25,550
Can we just keep
just a small shred of mystery

1042
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,151
in our relationship, please?

1043
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,349
Look, I saw you
have two babies, okay?

1044
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,093
Seriously, I need you
to get up all in that.

1045
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,857
I do not want to
investigate your anus.

1046
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,026
Payback time.

1047
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,636
It's a hemorrhoid.

1048
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,806
Thank you.

1049
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,307
Now, erase that
from your memory.

1050
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,053
Where'd she get those clothes?
Those are expensive clothes.

1051
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,917
Think. Where do you think?

1052
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,629
I don't want
this to sound harsh,

1053
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,633
but everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie.

1054
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,066
Everything that
goes into it is a dick.

1055
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,966
Everything that
goes in is dicks?

1056
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,365
A dick.

1057
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,666
Don't say that.

1058
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:22,069
I'm sorry.
I'm just being
protective of the store.

1059
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,209
I'm going to go
talk to her.

1060
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,112
Hey, Desi.

1061
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,448
Hi.
Hi.

1062
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,586
Is that your new
Acura out front?

1063
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,085
Uh, yeah.

1064
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,319
It's so nice.

1065
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,553
Do you love it?

1066
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,754
I mean, it's not a fucking
Porsche, but it'll do for now.

1067
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,491
Huh.

1068
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,365
Hey, Desi,
would you mind wearing

1069
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,164
some of the clothes that
we have in the store?

1070
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,305
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1071
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,867
Will that be okay?
Yeah.

1072
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,635
Perfect.

1073
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,110
Good?

1074
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,405
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

1075
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,775
Did you?
Yeah.

1076
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,047
The tiger, I did it on a piece
of paper separately,

1077
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,988
and then I actually
transferred it to the T-shirt.

1078
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,182
Wow.

1079
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,427
So, you stenciled
on the tiger?

1080
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,426
I drew it on
a piece of paper and then

1081
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,055
I transferred
the drawing to the T-shirt.

1082
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,566
You have an amazing body.

1083
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,827
Really?

1084
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,371
Yes. Are those real?

1085
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,798
My boobs?
Yeah.

1086
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,368
Yeah. Do you wanna
touch them?

1087
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,669
Really?

1088
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,109
Touch them.

1089
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,373
Okay.

1090
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,550
Wow.

1091
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,176
Huh.

1092
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,914
Jesus.

1093
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:45,658
I mean,
they really are amazing.
That's firm, for real.

1094
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,828
They're like
a memory mattress.

1095
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,631
It's, wow, like
Tempur-Pedic, you know?

1096
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,731
They look amazing.

1097
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,369
My kids just sucked
the meat right out of mine.

1098
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,868
No.
Yeah.

1099
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,000
There's some meat in there.

1100
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:04,079
My boobs are just gone.
Since I had kids,
my boobs are just gone.

1101
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,945
They didn't even
say goodbye, you know?
They just left.

1102
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:10,684
By the time I'm 40,
these are gonna
go National Geographic on me.

1103
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,889
I feel bad about
myself right now.

1104
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,983
I think this is
a really good offer
on the house.

1105
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,720
We expected more.

1106
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,286
I know it's a bad market,

1107
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,457
but that's still way under
what we were looking for.

1108
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:27,128
I know, but based on what
the market's like, it's like
you're gaining money,

1109
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,762
because it's so much
more than what you deserve.

1110
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:30,932
But these people are from Iran

1111
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,407
and they don't really know
that they're offering
too much.

1112
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,138
Is there any chance
that Debbie will go for it?

1113
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,075
I doubt it.
I mean, I don't know.

1114
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,012
There's a lot of
inventory out there.

1115
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,947
I mean, what is her problem?

1116
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,882
She has
unrealistic expectations.

1117
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,714
I'm faster than you!

1118
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,347
We're Jewish!

1119
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,890
Hey! Did you miss me, Travis?

1120
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,194
It's Jack.

1121
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,926
Hey, Jack.

1122
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,462
My daddy
doesn't know my name!

1123
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,864
Okay, come on,
let's go.

1124
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,996
Can I go show them my
crystals before they leave?

1125
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,198
Yeah, really quick.

1126
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,502
It's all right with me.
Elevator down!

1127
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,837
Okay. Go play with
your tiny uncles.

1128
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,710
- Let's play murder!
- Yeah. Let's go.

1129
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,576
So, what are you doing?
Spring cleaning?

1130
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:18,347
I'm getting rid of
everything in the house
that has gluten or sugar.

1131
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,145
Why? What's wrong
with gluten?

1132
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,588
Gluten's really bad for you.

1133
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,289
I don't think so.
It's wheat.

1134
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,620
Don't you watch Dr. Oz?

1135
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,054
As in, "The Wizard of"?

1136
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,690
Hey, Mom, we were wondering
if we can use
the computer to iChat?

1137
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,091
Remember the rules?
8:00 to 8:30.

1138
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,859
Yeah, but I have
a friend over.

1139
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,961
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, I know.

1140
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,339
Why don't you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

1141
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,807
Hey, remember the Alamo?

1142
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,411
Have you ever
built a fort, Wendy?

1143
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:43,705
Like, on Facebook?

1144
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,307
I will take this
if you're gonna
throw it away,

1145
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,714
because at our house,
we're wheat-eaters.

1146
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,020
But don't you want
to live long enough
to see your kids grow up?

1147
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,888
That's up to God, honey.

1148
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,082
No, but that's really
not good for the kids.

1149
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,327
Eh, the kids eat grass,
this is fine.

1150
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,290
Wendy's mom lets her go on
whenever she wants.

1151
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,988
Yeah, my mom's
pretty cool about it

1152
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,828
as long as
I finish my homework.

1153
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,328
Yeah.

1154
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,332
Well, I guess
I'm not the cool one,

1155
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,839
but the rules are just
different in our house.

1156
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,332
Well, I get better
grades than Wendy.

1157
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,478
She does. She's so smart.

1158
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,311
Let me just grab
the candy worms.

1159
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,911
See, your rules
are ridiculous.

1160
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,273
Don't sass me.

1161
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,586
I'm only sassing you
because you're throwing out
all the food in our house

1162
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,280
and I'm freaking starving.

1163
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,480
You're being stupid.

1164
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,385
Wendy, could you go stand
in the other room, please?

1165
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,784
Yeah.
Mom.

1166
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,051
Give me your iPhone, now.

1167
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,558
The nougat things are good.

1168
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,592
I have all my
contacts in there.

1169
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,493
Okay, if you don't give me
your phone right now,

1170
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,864
then I'm gonna
have to take away
your phone and your computer.

1171
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,162
Jesus Christ, I need
my computer to do homework.

1172
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,932
That's it.
No phone, no computer.

1173
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,130
This is B.S.

1174
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,969
This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You're acting like a B.

1175
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,039
Kids! Time to go!

1176
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:50,940
You go to your room,
right now.

1177
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,478
You are not allowed to use

1178
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:57,219
iPhone, iPad,
iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix,

1179
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,285
Pandora, or Spotify.

1180
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,523
She's a little pip,
just like her mommy.

1181
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,558
So, I might have
a job tomorrow.

1182
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,832
At least, I'm gonna go
try to give an estimate.

1183
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,560
Do you mind taking the kids
for a couple of hours?

1184
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,629
Um...

1185
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,794
Okay.

1186
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,437
This is nice.

1187
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,800
You and I don't spend
enough time together, do we?

1188
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,876
We spend enough time together.

1189
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,136
We do?

1190
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,411
It's quality time.

1191
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,050
Then we do.

1192
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,976
I'll go with what you think.

1193
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,721
What else did they say?

1194
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,617
All right,
some kid named Joseph...

1195
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,386
I know Joseph.
You do?

1196
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,187
He's making
a "hot-or-not" list.

1197
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,688
What?

1198
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,130
Sadie said, "That's so lame
and immature that
you're doing that."

1199
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,067
And then Joseph says,
"Yo, girl,
we're just having some fun.

1200
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,795
"So don't be a bitch, yo."

1201
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,267
That is not nice.

1202
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,508
So then Sadie said,
"Don't call me a bitch."

1203
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,100
And Joseph said,
"l didn't call you a bitch.

1204
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,770
"l said don't
act like a bitch.

1205
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,905
"And by the way,
you're in
the 'Not-Hot' column."

1206
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,441
Who made him
the judge of "hot"?

1207
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,415
Do you realize what that
could do to her self-esteem?

1208
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,146
What a little fuckhead.
I'll kill him.

1209
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,586
Then Sadie said,
"You're in the
jackass column.

1210
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,455
"l gotta go,
I'm bored of you."

1211
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,485
That is cool.
That's taking the high road.

1212
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,061
And then,
for some reason,

1213
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,225
there's an emoticon
of a panda doing push-ups.

1214
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,869
I wonder what that means.

1215
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,904
I don't think it
means anything.
I think it's just adorable.

1216
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,567
Aww.

1217
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:27,039
Well, she's a good girl.

1218
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,870
She was polite and she
stood up for herself.

1219
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,640
That's pretty cool.

1220
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,272
What?

1221
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,509
Shit.
What?

1222
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,876
I thought she was coming in.

1223
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,715
Oh, my God,
that scared me to death.

1224
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,411
If she caught us,
she would kill us.

1225
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:40,853
She would.
She would kill us.

1226
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:42,215
Huh.

1227
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,226
I gotta make a call.

1228
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,461
We sold how many?

1229
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,597
612 album downloads.

1230
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,204
Wait a minute. There
are no zeroes after that?

1231
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:03,871
There are zeroes,
but all of them
are before 612.

1232
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,307
There are none after.

1233
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,915
How is that even possible?

1234
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,417
Well, out of
300 million Americans,

1235
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:13,454
612 people chose
to download the album.

1236
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,650
You could personally call
everyone who
bought this record.

1237
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,158
We're fucked, we're fucked.

1238
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,996
Here's the deal,
I want you to meet me
tomorrow morning at 8:00.

1239
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,432
I want a list of at least
30 ideas of what we can do
to change this.

1240
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,833
We have to change this.

1241
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,663
I started a record label
because I couldn't get a job,

1242
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,071
so I have no other options.

1243
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,523
What financial problems?

1244
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,327
Well, I mean, for one thing,
you were right.

1245
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:57,730
You are missing about
$10,000 from the store.

1246
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,392
And then, Pete's
record not selling well.

1247
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,835
Pete's record
not selling...

1248
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,135
I thought we weren't supposed
to hear for three weeks.

1249
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,534
We heard.
You heard?

1250
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:06,836
And they're bad.

1251
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,206
It's that and it's the money
that he's been
lending his father.

1252
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,110
That's creating a strain.

1253
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,342
How much have we lent him?

1254
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,644
Eighty thousand.

1255
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:19,413
Did you say 8,000 or 80,000?

1256
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,120
80,000, over
the past couple ofyears.

1257
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,387
And then you missed
the mortgage payment.

1258
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,586
On the house?

1259
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:29,222
And you missed
the rental on the office.

1260
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,261
Does Pete know that?

1261
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,959
Yeah, we're on
the phone all the time.

1262
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,168
Look, I know you're
going through a hard time.

1263
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,834
And I want you guys to know
that we're here for you, okay?

1264
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,070
Anything you guys need,
that's why we're here.

1265
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,204
We're here for
times like this.

1266
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:45,744
What are you gonna do?

1267
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,839
There's not much I can do.

1268
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,122
What are you doing?

1269
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,489
I'm drawing the album cover
for Van Halen's Diver Down.

1270
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,859
If you spent a little bit more
time focusing on Graham Parker

1271
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,266
instead of
drawing album covers,

1272
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,037
I wouldn't be in
this predicament.

1273
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,834
I'm focused on
Graham Parker.

1274
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,701
You're supposed to
help me with him.

1275
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,299
You're supposed to
call the companies.

1276
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,709
You're supposed to
get people to the show.

1277
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,473
I've done
everything I can, Pete.

1278
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,243
You had me
pushing around a corpse.

1279
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,744
It was like being in fucking
Weekend at Graham's.

1280
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,580
What should we do?
I'm out of ideas.

1281
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,450
You fly in The Rumour.

1282
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:30,753
I can't sell a reunion
concert without the band,
it's ridiculous.

1283
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,058
With what?
I can't afford it.

1284
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,723
You put this on yourself.
You wanted the responsibility.

1285
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,392
Take it on the fucking chin,
and stop acting like a bitch.

1286
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,958
What did you call me?

1287
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,161
Chin.

1288
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,071
Pete. Wait, Pete!

1289
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:46,898
Hey, I have an apartment.

1290
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,841
I have health insurance,
I have car payments.

1291
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,105
I have responsibilities.

1292
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,012
You have responsibilities?
Don't talk to me
about responsibilities.

1293
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,380
I have a life.
I have a family.

1294
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,644
I can't afford to
sit in my apartment
getting high, jerking off,

1295
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,383
and then going to
Tommy's Chili Burgers
at 3:00 in the morning.

1296
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,823
That's not even the order
that that happens in!

1297
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,589
I have everything
to lose, here.
Everything.

1298
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:10,560
Yes, because you spent
thousands of dollars
on shit we don't need.

1299
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,826
You really need
to spend $30,000 on
a fucking neon sign, dude?

1300
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:19,004
Which is inside,
it's not even outside.
We know where we work.

1301
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,843
If you want to sign a band,
you gotta look like
you're the real deal.

1302
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:25,310
Princess Labia, how much is it
to fucking fly The Rumour in?

1303
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,541
It's 12,000.

1304
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:27,913
$12,000!

1305
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,709
All right,
you know what? Fine.

1306
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,584
Fly in The Rumour.
Put it on my AmEx.

1307
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,882
No, you said
it was impossible.

1308
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,124
I don't think
I said "impossible."

1309
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,454
Yeah.

1310
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,293
I usually don't
say "impossible."

1311
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,129
I like to leave
some wiggle room.

1312
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:50,305
You said that my fibroid
was like a giant boulder,

1313
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,036
Iike the one from
the Indiana Jones movies

1314
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,002
blocking up my uterus.
Uterus.

1315
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,243
And I need to stop using
that reference
of Indiana Jones.

1316
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:04,943
I think that that's not
appropriate when talking about
the reproductive system.

1317
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,515
It's okay.

1318
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:09,649
Anyway, somehow the
Eastern medicine has worked,

1319
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,522
and the fibroid
has dissipated.

1320
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,457
That's great!
Yes.

1321
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:16,792
Wow.
Yes.

1322
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,892
Your fibroid
shrunk and somehow

1323
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,071
it allowed you
to get pregnant.

1324
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,567
What?

1325
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,571
You're gonna have
your third baby.

1326
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,373
Congratulations.

1327
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,379
No.

1328
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,618
Yes.

1329
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,327
Would you like some water?

1330
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,722
That's good news.

1331
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,164
Another baby.

1332
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,426
At 40.

1333
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:54,727
Debbie?

1334
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,465
I am thrilled.

1335
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,803
And Pete is gonna be so happy.

1336
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,044
So, you're okay?

1337
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,617
What a relief.

1338
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,817
Because I can finally
relax now, you know?

1339
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,983
It's been, like...

1340
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,021
It's okay.

1341
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,096
I'm so happy,
though, you know?

1342
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,569
I really am,
because, I mean...

1343
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,265
It's good.

1344
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,439
Great. Great.

1345
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,751
Hey.
Hey.

1346
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,456
Why are you in a bathrobe?
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

1347
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,864
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

1348
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,127
I'm sorry about the record.

1349
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,739
You're going
through financial shit.
This is what I live with.

1350
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,738
This is a horrible
time in human history.
What is that?

1351
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,036
It's something that might
help both of our situations.

1352
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,580
This is
a drawing by John Lennon.

1353
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,144
I got it 10 years ago
for $5,000.

1354
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:51,615
I don't know how
much it's worth now.

1355
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:52,881
It could be five,
it could be 20.

1356
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,685
I don't want this.

1357
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,892
I don't even like it.
I'm not gonna hang it up.

1358
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,688
It's not for you to hang up.
It's for you to sell.

1359
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,890
That way, I can give it to you
and you make some money,

1360
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,489
and Debbie won't know
that I'm giving you anything.

1361
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,669
You're not giving me money.
You're giving me a project.

1362
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,429
I don't know how to sell this.
I'm not an art dealer.

1363
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,131
I don't know.
Sell it online.

1364
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,708
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

1365
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,344
Or is that too hard to do
with your high blood pressure?

1366
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,449
All right.
Don't get snippy.

1367
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,217
Just because you
write a great song
doesn't mean you can draw.

1368
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,014
It's incredible.
John Lennon drew it.

1369
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,753
I think it's a Ringo.

1370
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,385
Don't beat me up if
I get $300 for it.

1371
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,027
Don't take anything
less than $6,500 for that.

1372
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,254
It's very valuable.
It's important to me.

1373
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:37,923
I want you to sell
it so I can help you.

1374
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,396
Okay.

1375
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,627
All right.
I'll see you at my party.

1376
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,069
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

1377
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,672
No, don't buy wine
with my money
and give it to me at my party.

1378
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:48,901
That's mean.

1379
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,603
I love you. Bye.
All right.

1380
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,047
How do I call eBay?

1381
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,978
I mean, he called me a bitch.
What am I supposed to say?

1382
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:02,514
But I think maybe that
might mean he likes me.

1383
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:05,992
I don't know.
It's making me really...
It's really awkward.

1384
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:08,419
I think he might like you.

1385
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,562
She's so cute.
She's so tall.

1386
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:14,995
I know.

1387
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,161
How did that happen?

1388
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,168
Do you ever wish we
had a bigger family?

1389
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,309
No.
Never for a second.

1390
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,373
Never.

1391
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,005
Never?
Never.

1392
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,678
I love what we have.

1393
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,283
One? A breeze.

1394
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,987
Two? Brutal.

1395
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,686
Three?
Put a bullet in my head.

1396
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:36,914
Ugh.

1397
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,557
You know, I think about that
gray-haired pregnant lady
from school,

1398
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,563
and I just feel bad for her.

1399
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,758
And I feel bad
for the kid.

1400
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,466
Can you imagine?

1401
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,730
All the other little kids,
"Where's your mommy?"

1402
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:52,706
"Oh, she's the one
sitting in that scooter,
eating a soft cracker."

1403
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,609
Kids don't want to
have old parents.

1404
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,642
You know what?
It would also be nice for
us to spend some time apart.

1405
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,846
Kind of rediscover who
we are, individually.

1406
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,644
It'd be so great to not
see you for a chunk of time,

1407
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,312
so that I could
really just miss you.

1408
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,089
Remember when we
used to miss each other?

1409
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,261
Hey! Hey, you.

1410
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:23,897
Yeah, what's up?

1411
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,468
Hey, I'm Sadie's mom.

1412
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,035
Sadie?

1413
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,044
Sadie, the one you
chat with on the lnternet.

1414
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,404
No, man. That ain't me.

1415
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,243
Well, it was you.
I saw your picture.

1416
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:37,546
Did you make a hot list?
And not put Sadie
on the hot list?

1417
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,082
She was not on my list, no.

1418
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,583
You know
what I'm gonna do?

1419
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:41,884
I'm gonna make
my own hot list.

1420
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,983
And you know what?
You're on the not-hot list.

1421
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,353
How does that feel?

1422
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,923
It doesn't bother me.
I'm comfortable
with the way I am.

1423
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,293
Maybe you shouldn't be
so comfortable with yourself.

1424
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,965
You know why?

1425
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,501
You look like
a miniature Tom Petty.

1426
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,169
How's that feel?

1427
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,104
You think that
haircut's cool? It's not.

1428
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,003
It looks like you
put your Justin
Bieber wig on backwards.

1429
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,107
Are you still
comfortable with yourself?

1430
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,278
Why are you wearing
a tank top? Huh?

1431
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:10,351
So you can show off
your little bald pits,
you little hairless wonder?

1432
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,917
Cool tank top,
man. Huh?

1433
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:17,923
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

1434
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,121
on my daughter's
Facebook page,
just remember me.

1435
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,355
Remember me.

1436
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,660
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

1437
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,029
Okay, I'm sorry.

1438
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:30,002
Wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey!

1439
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,139
Wait. You're not...
Are you crying?

1440
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,366
Just let me go.

1441
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,770
Oh, my...

1442
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,569
I'm sorry.
Okay.

1443
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,240
I'm sorry.

1444
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,642
I'm not in my right head.

1445
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,208
I understand.
My mom's going
through menopause, too.

1446
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,344
It's a hard time.
