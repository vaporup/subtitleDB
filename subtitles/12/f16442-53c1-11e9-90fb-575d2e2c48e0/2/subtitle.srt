1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:01,794
What'd you say?

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,236
Are you going
through menopause?

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,531
I'm not going
through menopause.

4
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:08,769
I'm not gonna go through
menopause for like 20 years.

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,041
I'm pregnant,
you little bitch.

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,371
God damn it!

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,279
God damn it!

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,118
I'm going out with Desi
to find out if
she's stealing from us.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,416
I've got
the Graham Parker concert.
Who's gonna watch the kids?

10
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,786
I don't know.
Figure it out.

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,497
I kind ofjust wanted to talk.

12
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:38,368
I thought maybe we could go
to a coffeehouse or something.

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,029
You want coffee?
This place has coffee.

14
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,042
They have
all kinds of drinks.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,499
Um...

16
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,975
But someplace
quiet, maybe.

17
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,872
This place
can be quiet.

18
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,277
There's a spot in the back.
It's pretty quiet.

19
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,350
What sport
do you guys play?

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,748
We play hockey.

21
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,485
Oh, I like hockey.

22
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,783
Who do you guys
play for?

23
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,653
We play for
the Philadelphia Flyers.

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,627
So, you guys are
all from Philadelphia?

25
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,160
No.

26
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,595
Actually, none of us are.

27
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,359
Do you guys still
have all ofyour teeth?

28
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:12,003
Well, I got all my
teeth except these ones.

29
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,333
Do you want to
try them on?

30
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,770
Yeah, I'll do it.
Go for it.

31
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,107
Do I look sexy?

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,408
Yeah!

33
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,176
Do you want to
make out with me?

34
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,015
Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,584
Wow.

36
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,626
They definitely look
way better on her
than they do on you.

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,818
Here we go.

38
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,857
Thank you.

39
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,934
So, should we go
to the quiet area?

40
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,599
No, no, no.

41
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,595
Where are you going?

42
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,138
We kind of have to have
a little business
meeting tonight.

43
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,400
Business meeting?

44
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,237
Girls, you gotta celebrate
because we won tonight.
Let's go.

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,005
I want to party
with these winners.
Come on, Deb.

46
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,611
Just come to the stage
and dance with us.

47
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,406
Yeah.
Okay.

48
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:56,978
Yeah!

49
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,214
Okay, let's fucking dance!

50
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,450
Yeah!

51
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,923
Don't be shy,
feel free to come down
and fill up these empty seats.

52
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,726
Thank you so much for coming.
This is so exciting!

53
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,191
For the first time
in over 30 years,

54
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,262
Graham Parker & The Rumour.

55
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,879
Where are his fans?
I mean, where are they?

56
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:07,346
It's hard to watch a band
when you know all of
them remember D-Day.

57
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,294
What was
the press turnout like?

58
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,453
Oh. You're serious?

59
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,025
Nobody came. Nobody.

60
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,428
Nobody is here?

61
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,466
The guy from
Green Day is here.

62
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,765
Yeah, Billie Joe,
I emailed him. He's a fan.

63
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,970
You gotta get a photo
of the two of them.

64
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,634
No, he says he doesn't
want to do any press.

65
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,109
He's just watching the show.

66
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,808
Oh, how punk-rock of him.
"l don't like photographs."

67
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,449
Grow up, Green Day!

68
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,443
Shut the fuck up, Tom Selleck!

69
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,386
You don't have, like...

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,157
I wouldn't call them
classically good dance moves,

71
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,488
but you left it
all out there.

72
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,760
You're a blast
to dance with.

73
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,393
Thank you.

74
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,336
We're having a little shindig
at the hotel after this.

75
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,499
You should come by
and hang out at the hotel.

76
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,638
You want me to
come to the hotel?

77
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,905
Yes, I want you to come

78
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,181
by the hotel with me.

79
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,516
Well, what would we
do there?

80
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,851
Maybe we can find somewhere
quiet and have fun and kind
of see where it goes.

81
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:56,859
Do it like adults
do sometimes and...

82
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,922
Like, sex?

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,768
I mean, if you want.

84
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:07,269
If that's on the docket,
but I'm not
trying to force that.

85
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,542
So, you would
do sex with me?

86
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,003
"Do sex"?

87
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,778
What are you, Borat?

88
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,207
Are you hitting on me?

89
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,837
Yes, yes,
I'm hitting on you.

90
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,779
You're hot and cool and nice
and you have beautiful eyes.

91
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,752
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,059
I'm married,
I have two kids
and I'm pregnant.

93
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,754
That is what we call
the hat-trick. Wow.

94
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,497
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

95
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,365
I was just really enjoying
you being so nice to me.

96
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,775
I hope this doesn't
come off as super-cheesy,

97
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:47,007
but I think you're
a very rare find.

98
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,711
Thank you.

99
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,406
And I would totally
"do sex" with you.

100
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,649
That was
spectacular, guys.

101
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,815
Really well done. Amazing.

102
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,688
Thank you.
Good, good.

103
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,651
Hey, Graham.

104
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,452
Pete. How are you, man?

105
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,963
Well, the first numbers
came in.

106
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,700
Yeah, right, yeah.

107
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,229
Happy? How's it looking?

108
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,128
About half of
your last record.

109
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,805
Ah. So, you were
expecting it to sell?

110
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,835
They never sell anymore.
They used to sell,
but now they don't.

111
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,808
I'm not a sexy
16-year-old girl.

112
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,175
But I wanted to sell it.
It's such a good record.

113
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,684
I feel like I let you down.

114
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,377
No, I'm gonna be fine, man.
My overheads are so low.

115
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,621
I just got a song in Glee.

116
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,917
The guy in the wheelchair
is gonna sing it to
the Asian girl, I believe.

117
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,293
I don't know,
I've never seen the show,
but that's what I'm told.

118
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,695
The secret is,
make sure you
have a small nut.

119
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,691
That's the key to life.

120
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,734
Graham, I don't have
small nuts, all right?

121
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,863
I have big nuts
and I need to
provide for them.

122
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,908
Graham!
Hey, what's up?

123
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,101
Billie!

124
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,370
Graham,
how are you doing, man?

125
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,968
Great fucking show, man.
Good to see you.

126
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,239
Thank you.
Fuck.

127
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,939
Yeah, I'm inspired.

128
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,539
I want to write
a fucking song right now.

129
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,641
Inspired.
Yeah.

130
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,776
That inspires me.

131
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,252
Let's go get a drink.
Let's get a drink.

132
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,648
All right. You coming?

133
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,156
No, no, I'm fine.
You guys go.

134
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,816
Congratulations on Glee.

135
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,589
Oh!
Yes, thank you.

136
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,229
All right.
See you, Pete.

137
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,091
All right. So long, guys.
Later.

138
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,258
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,265
You got a song on Glee?
Yeah.

140
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,530
That's killer, man.
That's so much money.

141
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,069
It's great.
It's good for all of us.

142
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,866
Why did you put that
guy's teeth in your mouth?

143
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,800
That's so gross.

144
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,103
I was drunk.
He was dirty.

145
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,073
No, he was wearing a tie.

146
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,304
That's true.
He wasn't dirty.

147
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,082
When I kissed him,
I felt his little tiny
teeth nubs with my tongue.

148
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,547
You did?
Yeah.

149
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,219
It was like kissing a baby.

150
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,481
French-kissing a baby.

151
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,192
Can I ask you
something stupid?
Uh-huh.

152
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,760
Do you know why we're
missing money at the store?

153
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,059
Are you guys missing money?

154
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,497
Yeah. Like, $12,000.

155
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,399
Do you think
that I took it?

156
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,439
No. I mean...
Well, no.

157
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,771
I did and I don't now.

158
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,203
It's not me.

159
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,080
Why do you live in
such a nice apartment
and have such a fancy car?

160
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,318
Yes, you're right.
Um... Look...

161
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,215
I am an escort.

162
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,125
I get paid
to go out on dates.

163
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,825
You...

164
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,057
Oh.

165
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,835
But only three to
five times a year.

166
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,263
Ten times, max.

167
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:05,408
But it's not technically
prostitution, because I don't
have to sleep with them.

168
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,771
Oh, well, that's good.

169
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,904
But I always do.

170
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,140
That's why I only do it
four to eight times a year.

171
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,544
Fifteen times, max.

172
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,910
Huh.

173
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,082
One year, I did it 20.

174
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,051
Well, as long as
you think it's safe.

175
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,284
It's safe.

176
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,319
I only do it 10
to 30 times a year.

177
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,728
So, who do you
think is stealing money?

178
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,427
It's fucking Jodi.

179
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,225
No.
Yeah.

180
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,204
She's a pilled-out whore.

181
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,465
Huh.

182
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,475
Since you told me,
I want to tell you something.

183
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,344
You're pregnant.

184
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,006
How'd you know?

185
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,779
Wow.

186
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,446
Maybe you should tell Pete.

187
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,780
You didn't tell Pete yet?

188
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,011
I haven't told Pete.

189
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,386
Why?
I don't know why.

190
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,389
I just want him to want me.

191
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,122
I don't want him to want me
because I'm pregnant.

192
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,224
Go home and
fucking suck his dick

193
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,059
and tell him then,
and he will love it.

194
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,559
You think?
He'll be so excited.

195
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,064
Or even better yet...
Better yet,

196
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,603
you should tell him
while you're
sucking his dick, like...

197
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,799
"I'm pregnant."

198
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,141
What are you doing?

199
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,149
Um, returning some emails.

200
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,485
What time do you
have to go to work?

201
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,385
Like, 10 minutes ago.

202
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,648
Do you wanna be late?

203
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,461
No, I can't be late,
not today.

204
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,699
Do you see me standing
here in front of you,

205
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,038
half-naked?

206
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,341
Yeah.

207
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,480
And does that

208
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,879
make you feel anything, or...

209
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,091
Come on.
Are you trying
to start a fight?

210
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,057
No, I'm not trying
to start a fight with you.

211
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,357
I'm trying to fuck you.

212
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,289
Oh, God, you know what?

213
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,490
Today, of all days,

214
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,961
is the day you need to
cut me a break, all right?

215
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,466
Whatever.

216
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,203
Oh, God.

217
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,638
What?

218
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,508
I didn't realize
it was intentional.

219
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,382
I didn't say anything
because I didn't want
you to be embarrassed.

220
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,717
I thought I was being gallant.

221
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,452
All right, fine.
I'm an asshole.

222
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,255
God.

223
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,125
You know
what your problem is?

224
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,927
You're never,
ever in the moment.

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,436
You're never, ever present.
You're never in your body.

226
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,731
That's not true.
I am in the moment.
You know how I know?

227
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,569
I want to get
the fuck out of the moment.

228
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,640
I swear,
I can't win with you.
I just can't do it.

229
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,438
You can't just walk away.

230
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:56,942
Oh, God.

231
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,343
Hey! How's the record
company going, Pete?

232
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,746
What? Not great.

233
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,686
I'm still waiting
for numbers to come in.

234
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,520
What have you heard?

235
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,526
A couple numbers
have trickled in.

236
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,291
It's lower than we expected.

237
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,861
Then why are you
giving Larry money?

238
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,362
What?

239
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,834
I know everything.
I talked to the accountant.

240
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,709
You know what?
I don't wanna get
into some nasty fight

241
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,277
so can we please
talk to each other

242
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,041
the way the therapist told us
to talk to each other?

243
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,808
Fine. Fine.

244
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,419
It makes me feel sad
when you are dishonest.

245
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,456
I understand it
makes you feel bad
when I am dishonest with you.

246
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,963
It hurts my feelings when
you treat me with contempt

247
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,499
and corner me,
and try and
trick me into lying.

248
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,692
Okay.

249
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,295
It makes me sad
when it's so easy to
trick you into lying,

250
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,397
because you're
such a lying shit-bag.

251
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,505
That's not...
You can't do that,
you can't do that.

252
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,268
The therapist said you're
not allowed to judge me.

253
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,535
That's not a judgment,
that's just a fact.

254
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,779
Fair enough.

255
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,179
Sometimes I withhold truth,
that is true.

256
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,310
But it's only because
I'm scared to death

257
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,753
of your crazy-assed,
illogical overreactions.

258
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,254
Well...

259
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,352
It hurts me
inside and triggers me

260
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,398
when you're such
a dishonest shit,

261
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,059
that you're lending
your father money
without telling me

262
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,429
while your record
company's going bankrupt

263
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,496
and we're on the verge
of losing our fucking house!

264
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,747
What else are you
lying about?

265
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,525
I've taken
Viagra for two years.

266
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,090
I ate six muffins
downstairs a while ago

267
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,595
and my
cholesterol level is 305.

268
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,099
My heart could
explode at any second.

269
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,996
These might be my
very last words.

270
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,834
Oh, and I gave Charlotte
antibiotics when
you weren't looking.

271
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,442
That's why her ear got better.
So, go fuck your witch doctor.

272
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,605
What are we even doing?
What are we doing?

273
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,010
This is not
making me happy.
You're not happy.

274
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,755
You don't like me.
I can feel that.

275
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,917
I'm not blind.

276
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,921
Jesus.

277
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,725
We're like
business associates.

278
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,992
We're like
brother and sister.

279
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,361
There's no passion there.

280
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,398
We're not like
brother and sister.
You know what we're like?

281
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,936
We're like Simon and Garfunkel

282
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,903
and, somehow,
you turned me into Garfunkel.

283
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,233
I don't even know
what that means.

284
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,365
Art Garfunkel.

285
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:39,171
What's wrong
with Art Garfunkel?
He has a beautiful voice.

286
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,610
He's got an amazing voice!
He could put
a harmony to anything!

287
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,115
But what I'm saying is that
you turned me into him.

288
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,774
What the hell are
you talking about?

289
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,447
Simon controls him!

290
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:51,315
That's because Simon
writes the fucking songs!

291
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,548
He's the better one!

292
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,518
You know what?
I see the way you
look at our kids.

293
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,756
You have so much
love and compassion for them.

294
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,025
You never look at
me like that. Ever.

295
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,266
Would we even
still be together

296
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,565
if I didn't get
pregnant 14 years ago?

297
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,963
You know what?
I'm not gonna go
down that road.

298
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,140
Would we?

299
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:25,882
Okay.

300
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,124
You know what?
I don't want to
have a party here.

301
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,425
You need to cancel it.

302
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,590
No, I'm not.

303
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,259
I already paid
for the catering.
I've put down deposits.

304
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,032
And I sure as fuck
am not gonna call
everybody back in two days

305
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,198
when you change your mind.

306
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,412
Your girlfriend is not ugly.

307
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,250
Actually, Larry,
she's not my girlfriend.
She's just a...

308
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,618
It's cool, buddy.
You don't have to explain
your girlfriend to me.

309
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,053
Can you please stop
licking your fingers?

310
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,631
Do you know how many
germs are on your hands?

311
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,026
And you're putting
them into your mouth.

312
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,862
That's gross. Stop.

313
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,498
Stop it!

314
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,173
I'm gonna kill you!

315
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,039
Hey! Sadie,
enough, all right?

316
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,134
She isn't hurting anyone.

317
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,839
You want to say something,
just keep your mouth shut.

318
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,538
You have never
been nice to her

319
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,207
and now she's getting
aggressive with you.

320
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,513
I told you
this would happen.

321
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,990
I'm sick of
everybody fighting.

322
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,396
What do you think
you're gonna be like
when you grow up?

323
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,207
I don't know. Um...

324
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,635
I don't know.

325
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,307
Do you think you want kids?

326
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,915
Mm-hmm. Just one.

327
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,277
Just one, why?

328
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:37,182
Because if I have two,
then the other will
fight with the other one.

329
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,550
Does it make you
sad when you fight?

330
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,652
Mm-hmm.
I don't want
anyone to fight.

331
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,226
I love you.

332
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,531
Why isn't anybody talking?
Why is it so quiet?

333
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,768
It's the Sounds of Silence.

334
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,831
Will you stop, Dad?

335
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,703
How many of those
are you gonna eat?

336
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,438
As many as I want.

337
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,183
I'm gonna tell Mom on you.

338
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,218
Try it. See what
you get for Christmas.

339
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,611
Nothing.

340
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,453
Snitches wind up in ditches.

341
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,259
Remember that.

342
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,626
Hey, Peter.

343
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,132
Hi.
Hiya.

344
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,236
All right. See you.

345
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,336
Have a good one.

346
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,070
Peter.

347
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,236
Peter!

348
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,272
Hi.

349
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,573
Catherine.

350
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,674
I'm Joseph's mother.

351
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,143
Oh, right.
No, I know.
Hi, Catherine.

352
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,582
Our kids have gone to school
together for eight years.

353
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,382
Sorry.

354
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,149
Hello, Joseph.

355
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,962
I hear our kids have
been chatting online.

356
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,026
Yeah? I heard that your wife
has been screaming at my son.

357
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,727
And I don't appreciate it.
Excuse me?

358
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,629
She screamed at my son.

359
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,829
Right? She threatened you.
She screamed at you.
She cursed at him.

360
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,201
He's 13 years old,
for God's sake.

361
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,937
What the hell is
the matter with her?

362
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,842
Okay, you better check
her meds and get 'em right.

363
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,479
Okay, you know what?
Why don't you
back the fuck off?

364
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,347
Because that's my lovely,
sweet wife
you're talking about.

365
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,216
Oh, I need to back off?
Yeah, you need to back off.

366
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,984
Because your kid
is an animal.
He's a fucking animal.

367
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,218
Why don't you
put him on a leash?

368
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,227
Turn around,
turn around, turn around!

369
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,759
If he insults my
daughter again,

370
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,263
I'm gonna hit him
with my fucking car.

371
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,388
Got it?

372
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,763
In fact,
ifyou insult my wife again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

373
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,666
I'm gonna show up
at your house
when you're sleeping

374
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,466
and I'll take your iPad
or your iPod or your iMac

375
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,166
and I'll shove them
up your fucking iCunt.

376
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,171
I got nothing to lose.
Your kid is the problem.

377
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,073
My kid is a fucking angel.
Turn around.

378
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,970
I don't have
time for this shit.

379
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,341
So I'm keeping it together,
but if I wasn't at
school right now...

380
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,078
Touch my... Touch me?

381
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,387
I didn't touch your...
You touched my upper breast.

382
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,618
I didn't. I didn't.
I got right
below your shoulder.

383
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,457
You got right here.
You actually...
He hit my nipple.

384
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,586
You what?

385
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,755
You're insane.

386
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,696
Why would you do that?
Did you just
touch my mom's nipple?

387
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,257
He just touched my nipple.
Why would you do that to me?

388
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,495
I poked you
on the shoulder.

389
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,935
I have very high nipples.

390
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,196
I touched your shirt.

391
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,638
What do you think
is under my shirt?

392
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,073
I just...
My breasts
are under my shirt.

393
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,872
Your shoulder.
Your shoulder.
He just touched my breast.

394
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,774
Well, that's a funny
place to put a shoulder,
on my boob.

395
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,972
Hello? There are
children around.

396
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,017
This isn't over.
This is not over.
You're gonna be sorry.

397
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,111
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

398
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,921
And why the fuck
would you believe Desi?

399
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,955
You just admitted it.

400
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,450
Did l?

401
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:40,090
You stole $12,000 from me,
Jodi, and I need
you to pay me back.

402
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,529
Could you at least
give me a referral?

403
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,264
You babysat my kids
while you were on OxyContin.

404
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,464
Oxycodone.

405
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,800
Well, oxycodone.

406
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,000
Oxycotton.

407
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,166
OxyContin?

408
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,301
Oxykitten.

409
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,640
What's Oxykitten?

410
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,070
Meow.

411
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,083
Jodi, you put me in danger.
Me and my family.

412
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,150
It was a cry for help.

413
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,580
Help. Help.

414
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,715
Why don't you help me?

415
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,093
Why don't you help me?
Just help.

416
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,691
Just help.

417
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,330
You didn't help me.

418
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,090
Are you high right now?

419
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,202
Help me.

420
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,565
Is that about me?
Is that the cops?

421
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,203
Is this a set-up?

422
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,539
I need to go.

423
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,243
Okay, see you later.

424
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,573
Fuck you, Debbie.

425
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,274
Fuck you.

426
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,387
Joseph was very upset
when I spoke to
him about this.

427
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,886
So I thought it
was important that we

428
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,355
join together and
work this through.

429
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,657
Absolutely.

430
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,331
We're gonna work
through it,

431
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,960
but Debbie told my son
that he looked
like Tom Petty,

432
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:52,628
in a negative way.

433
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,131
Who's Tom Petty?
You know who
Tom Petty is.

434
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:59,511
And she said that if she
had to come back
that she was going to...

435
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,511
"F" up his pussy-ass,
which is what she said.

436
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,708
Oh, my...

437
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,312
Are you serious?

438
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,779
I didn't.
I would never.
To a child?

439
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:15,482
Your son has been
defiling my daughter's
Facebook page now for months.

440
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,551
These people are liars.

441
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,425
He said that my
son was an animal

442
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,227
and that if I didn't
keep him on a leash,

443
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,096
that he would hit
him with his car.

444
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,797
Did you say that?

445
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,030
That's ridiculous.

446
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,738
Who talks like that?
You do.

447
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,738
He didn't say that.
He said it to me.

448
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,710
No. What I said
was that we need to keep
an extra eye on our kids

449
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,441
because with all
the technological advances,

450
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,608
they need to learn to
use them responsibly.

451
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,084
No. What he said to me was...
He called me an iCunt.

452
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,552
A what?
Language, Catherine!
Language.

453
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,646
I'm quoting!

454
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,119
How am I gonna relay

455
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,921
what these two nutballs
said to me, unless I say it?

456
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,988
Can you please not
talk like that, Catherine?

457
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,530
Music Man is
rehearsing next door.

458
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,623
Sorry, fucking Music Man.

459
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,198
Maybe if I looked
more like this
fake bullshit couple.

460
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,828
Looks like they're
in a bank commercial.

461
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,165
That's what you
look like.

462
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,537
Like you're a bullshit
bank commercial couple.

463
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,370
None of this
talk is productive.

464
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,414
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

465
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,449
and kick you both
in the fucking jaw
with my foot bone.

466
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,650
You're just really
scaring me.

467
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,551
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

468
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,985
You corner me,
I will fucking
chew through you.

469
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,420
I'll chew through you.

470
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,025
Catherine,
you're better than this.

471
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,688
Fuck you, Jill.
You're a horrible
fucking woman.

472
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,956
This is why everybody
hates you, Jill.

473
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,469
This kind of shit.
Ineffective.
Fucking bullshit hair.

474
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,865
And I'm glad
your husband died.

475
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,941
Because you're
a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

476
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,068
Okay, Catherine,
I think we know
what's happening now.

477
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,047
Now you know what
we're dealing with.

478
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,227
I'm not gonna
eat that chicken.

479
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,556
Why not?

480
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,456
Because I feel
like I'm gonna be
a vegetarian.

481
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,998
Can you become
a vegetarian tomorrow?
Uh-uh.

482
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,559
You guys
have been reading my texts?

483
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,902
No, we haven't.
Yes, we have.

484
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,736
We're supposed to
keep an eye on you.

485
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,899
How did you find out?

486
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,101
Joseph told me
that you flipped out
on him and his mom.

487
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,304
And you guys are nuts,
and I agree.

488
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,378
All right, you know what?
Don't be disrespectful.

489
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,144
You're the ones
who are disrespectful.

490
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,379
Reading my texts is like
reading my diary.

491
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,615
And you were really
sweet on your iChats.

492
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,713
We were really proud of you.

493
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,986
Yeah, we were going to
give you your computer
and phone back.

494
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,083
Fuck you!

495
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,094
Okay, there's the first
official "fuck you."

496
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,997
Okay, that is not
how we talk to each
other in this house.

497
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,365
You guys talk to each other
like that all the time.

498
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:15,166
And to Joseph and his mom.
You made Joseph cry.

499
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:19,034
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.

500
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,573
Shut up, Charlotte.

501
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:25,476
You guys so desperately
want me to be so perfect
and to make no mistakes.

502
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,416
Well, you two
are fucking insane.

503
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,643
Okay.

504
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,746
All you do is fight,
or you don't fight,
which is even worse

505
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,815
because it looks
like you hate
each other for weeks.

506
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,457
You obsess over
every little thing I do,

507
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,822
and you don't trust
in me or believe in me.

508
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,387
Well, I'm fucking sick of it.

509
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,102
Yeah, I said "fuck."
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

510
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:48,032
Ground me forever,
I don't care.
I don't care about anything.

511
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,472
I hate everything.

512
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,505
Everyone's going crazy.
I don't care if I have
no friends.

513
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,339
Are you still
upset about Lost?

514
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,975
Of course I'm
upset about Lost!

515
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,681
You guys took away my shit
before I could watch
the last two episodes.

516
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,691
And I don't know
what the fuck happened!

517
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,797
She's becoming
just like us.

518
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,861
I hope I never get my period
if this is what happens.

519
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,146
Where did you find this?

520
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,283
I stole it.

521
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,356
Thank you.

522
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,294
No big deal.

523
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,824
Our kids are fucking crazy.

524
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,492
And it's our fault.

525
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,568
Do you think there's anything
we can do to turn
it around, or...

526
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,704
Sadie's 13.
She might be
a lost cause.

527
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,968
Where did she learn
that kind of language?

528
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,410
We don't talk like that.

529
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,708
I have no fucking idea.

530
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,078
Do you think Sadie
is this crazy because of us

531
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,779
or is it hormones
and Lost?

532
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,653
J. J. Abrams.

533
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,351
He's ruining our daughter.
Yeah.

534
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,384
That fucking geek.

535
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,358
I feel bad for us.
I feel bad for us.

536
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,829
All of a sudden,
we're like a magnet
for negativity.

537
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,462
Why do people
keep attacking us?

538
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,098
What did we do?
We're just doing our best.

539
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,101
Should we talk
about our fight?

540
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,506
I think we're
under enough pressure.

541
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,411
Let's just let
it go, this time.

542
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,240
Yeah.

543
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:38,847
We can give
each other a break.

544
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,952
All right, great.
Thank you.

545
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,611
And I'm sorry about my dad.
You're right.

546
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,982
I'm sorry that he's just
an endless mooch.

547
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,723
The truth is that
this isn't about us.

548
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,498
It's about our parents.

549
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,157
We're not even
mad at each other.
We're mad at them.

550
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,998
Exactly. Exactly.

551
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,364
Let's just take away
our parents' power
by loving them.

552
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,400
Can we do that?

553
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,034
Yes.

554
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,369
Thank God.

555
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,205
I kind of feel
better already, do you?

556
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,981
Do you?
I do.

557
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,947
I love you.
I love you, too.

558
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,754
It's not us,
it's them.

559
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,353
Totally.

560
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,035
What are you doing?
We have to get
ready for the party.

561
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,804
I just watched
the last episode of Lost.

562
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,637
Okay.

563
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,981
You know what?
We don't have time
for this right now.

564
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,448
We have a lot of
people coming over.

565
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:47,882
They're all dead.

566
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,444
What?

567
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,413
Jack, Kate, Sawyer...

568
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,787
I don't care about
the show right now.
Jin, Sun...

569
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,555
Okay? I need you to
just get in the shower,
get dressed.

570
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,825
Let's just put it on hold.
Walt, Juliet...

571
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,726
All those people.

572
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,198
Don't think about Losttoday.

573
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,271
Tomorrow, Lost, all day.
I can't wait to hear about it.

574
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,771
Jack? No way, really?
Right now, shower.

575
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,477
I don't make fun of
your stupid Mad Men.

576
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,009
First of all, I don't get
worked up over Mad Men.

577
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,738
That's because
Mad Men sucks.

578
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,750
What Don Draper
has gone through

579
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,810
beats whatever Jack
is running from on
some fucking island.

580
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,823
Bunch of people
smoking in an office.
It's stupid.

581
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,892
You're getting me off topic.

582
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,085
Just, please, get dressed.

583
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,597
Hello.
Hi.

584
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,930
I'm glad you're here.

585
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,970
I need a buffer
in case it gets weird.

586
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,972
Oh, well,
I'm ready to buff.

587
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,442
Grab these napkins.
Let's buff. Okay.

588
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,438
So, that's the girl
who works for you.

589
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,914
Yeah. That's her.
Works for Debbie.

590
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,452
She seems nice.

591
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,952
My wife would
never let me have
a hot employee like that.

592
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:59,181
Yeah?
No.

593
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,053
Every woman
who works for us

594
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,558
Iooks like they've
been in some kind
of horrible accident.

595
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,991
I'm taking control,
and now you're my slave.

596
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,296
Are you comfortable with that
around your husband?

597
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,805
Oh. Pete wouldn't know
what to do with that.

598
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,835
Do you think
our wives are looking
at us right now?

599
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,274
Oh, definitely.
Yeah.

600
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,736
They look
like pedophiles.

601
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,651
Thank you.
The girls are so
excited you're here.

602
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,745
They're all outside.

603
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,153
Hi.
Hi.

604
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,322
Hey, how are you?
How are you, man?

605
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,585
Good to see you.

606
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,922
Happy birthday, Pete.

607
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,121
How wonderful to see you.

608
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,356
Thank you, Grandma Molly.

609
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,556
You're wonderful.

610
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,430
And look at my gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous.

611
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,297
No, I get that.
I'm just wondering
why I should do it.

612
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,496
Pete, Jason's here.

613
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,597
Peter, hi.

614
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,033
Hey, how's it going, Jason?

615
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,804
You look well.
Thank you.

616
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,045
How do you like
what I've been
doing to your girl?

617
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,808
How you like
Debbie's "after" body?

618
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,241
It's nice.
Come on. Show him.

619
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,611
Look at this.
It's beautiful.

620
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,654
Look at that "after" ass.
Now, it starts here.

621
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,281
But it used to start here.

622
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,555
And I brought it up.

623
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,061
You're welcome.

624
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,129
So, are you a trainer?

625
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,290
Yes.
Oh.

626
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,936
But not just physical.
Spiritual.
I'm sort of a guide.

627
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:23,168
Mm-hmm.
You guys should talk.
I think you'll get along.

628
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:25,767
Come here, honey.
I gotta tell you something.

629
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:26,936
Yeah.

630
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,916
Who's that in the pool?
Mine.

631
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,257
Hello.
Hello, Debbie.

632
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,625
How are you?
Good.

633
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,859
Remember my husband, Pete?

634
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:50,263
Oh, right.
I didn't recognize
you with the long hair.

635
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,802
Oh, yeah.
I've been growing it.

636
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,200
Happy birthday.

637
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,796
Thank you so much.

638
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:56,966
Very old Scotch.

639
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,737
Wow. You know...

640
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,172
I hope it hasn't expired.

641
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,771
No, Scotch doesn't expire.

642
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,013
It improves with age.

643
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,516
Yeah. No, I know.
Thank you so...

644
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,682
That's nice.
Come on in.
Sure.

645
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:13,781
Sorry.

646
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:19,929
So, what do you do
in Chino, Oliver?

647
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,987
I'm a surgeon.

648
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,499
Wow. What kind?
That's great.

649
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,131
Mainly of the spine.

650
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,701
My specialty is
scoliosis surgery.

651
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,774
My mom used to talk to me
like I had scoliosis

652
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,438
because I'm a little hunchy,
but that's a different thing.

653
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,308
Well, you definitely
don't look right.

654
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,881
Hey!
Hey!

655
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,650
Sorry we're late.

656
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,686
I was in the lab,
cloning myself.

657
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,888
We're gonna have
another seven tomorrow.

658
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,284
We cut their hair differently,
so we can finally
tell who they are.

659
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,191
You like
the new haircut,
Travis?

660
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,726
I'm Jack, damn it!

661
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,388
Oh. Of course.

662
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,123
Larry, this is my father.

663
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,464
Really? How are you?

664
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,270
Oliver.
Oliver?

665
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,804
"Can I have some more?

666
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,536
"Please, Oliver?
I need a little more, sir."

667
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,875
I love that movie.
You must get
that all the time.

668
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,139
Not really.
My nose
itches right here.

669
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,011
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I'm Claire and
I'm Larry's wife.

670
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,952
Very nice to see you,
but I'm gonna go get the kids.

671
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,849
We won't see her
now for the whole day.

672
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,390
I'd help, honey,
but you know I got
the blood pressure,

673
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,552
and I don't want to.

674
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:24,886
Can I get you a drink, Dad?

675
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,430
Yeah, a little white wine.

676
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,757
White wine?
Yeah.

677
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,423
Heavy stuff.
Yeah.

678
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,836
So, who knew that
Debbie had a dad?

679
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,104
Where have you
been for 15 years?

680
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,973
Never seen you at Hanukah
or Christmas or Ramadan,
nothing.

681
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,342
How you get out
of all that stuff?
Do you have a wife?

682
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,005
Yeah, my wife's at home.

683
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,275
Why didn't she come?

684
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,613
Uh, construction.
They're sanding our deck.

685
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,218
You let the woman
sand the deck?

686
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,019
She supervises it. Yes.

687
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,612
Okay.

688
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,747
Hey, guys.

689
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,692
Hey! Look how big
the kids are!

690
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,495
Sadie!

691
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,361
Hi, Larry.
Hi, Sadie.

692
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,664
Mom. Who's Oliver?

693
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:05,893
What do you mean?

694
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,462
Is he your dad?

695
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,835
Is he my...
He's my biological father.

696
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,573
What does that mean?

697
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,206
It means that my mom,
Grandma...

698
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,441
He and my mom had a baby,
and that was me.

699
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,445
Oh, so you're
our grandpa?

700
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,147
Well, why don't
you ask your mother?

701
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,086
Yeah. I guess so.

702
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,352
Then that would make him
your grandfather then, yes.

703
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,788
Do you want him to be?

704
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,726
Yes, then we get
another grandpa.

705
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,990
Come on.

706
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,053
Well...

707
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,865
Another grandpa.
Trampoline time.

708
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,098
That was deeply
uncomfortable.

709
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:46,003
At least that pretty girl
was here to divert
our attention.

710
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,388
Oh, my gosh. Hi.

711
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,257
Me, oh, my.
I did not see you there.

712
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,854
Hi.
I saw you there.

713
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,934
Did you guys come together?
Are you a couple?

714
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:15,268
No, we didn't come together.
No, absolutely not.

715
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,971
I'm sorry, I thought...
The moustache is a little...

716
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,303
- Mmm. That's fair.
- I just assumed.

717
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,438
This is
a straight-man moustache.

718
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,139
What is the difference between
a gay man's moustache

719
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,019
and a straight
man's moustache?

720
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,518
The smell.

721
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,181
Uh, excuse me.

722
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,162
So, spinal surgery.

723
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:47,432
It just seems to me
to be at the top
of the surgery chain.

724
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,665
Well,
we're not cardio,
we're not neuro,

725
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:54,805
but I like to think
we're an important
part of the spectrum.

726
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,913
Do you operate
every single day?
Most days.

727
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,174
Multiple times a day?

728
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,608
Three, four times.

729
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,177
So, what's the price range?
Like, if I wanted a...

730
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,450
I'd rather not say.

731
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,415
It's so big,
you're embarrassed to say.

732
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,217
I wouldn't say "embarrassed."

733
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,556
Are there hunchbacks today?
Of course.

734
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,688
I've never seen one.

735
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,993
Well, that's because
there are spinal surgeons.

736
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,123
That's because of you.

737
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,033
Each time I don't
see a hunchback,

738
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,537
you're getting
that much richer.

739
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,569
You like The Beatles,
don't you?

740
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:25,969
Who doesn't like The Beatles?
Nobody.

741
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,068
No, nobody.

742
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,779
So funny. You're so funny.

743
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,515
What is your sun sign?

744
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,349
Libra.
Oh, boy.

745
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,977
That's not good.
No, sir.

746
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,783
That's not good.
Not for me,
that's not good.

747
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,721
Sexually, we're
completely incompatible.

748
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,019
That's not true.
Right?

749
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,081
That's such a shame.

750
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,060
Yeah, it's as bad as it gets.

751
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,721
You don't know.
What is yours?

752
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,388
I'm a Cancer.

753
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,228
Really?
Is that good?

754
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,461
Wow.
What does it mean?

755
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:52,525
That's kind of strange.
Well...

756
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,304
Taurus and Cancers are,
sort of, soul mates
of the Zodiac.

757
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,599
We're, like,
perfectly compatible.

758
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,577
And I balance what
you lack and you
make up for what I lack.

759
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,412
And a quiet Cancer
almost always
has a huge penis.

760
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,815
You're making me embarrassed.
Thank you.

761
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,445
Thank you.

762
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,779
No. Fantastic.

763
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,789
Oh, I wanted
to make a toast.

764
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,262
Thank you guys for coming.
Thank you so much.

765
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,291
Pete's turning 40.

766
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,390
Weird.

767
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:26,094
And we're ready to start
this new phase of our
lives with open hearts.

768
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,237
Ready to just choose joy
and forgive everybody.

769
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,838
So, thank you all for coming.

770
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,607
Wait. Forgive who?

771
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,647
I think she just
means in a general sense.

772
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,412
You know, just put
the past behind us...

773
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,877
And live without resentment.

774
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,555
But, specifically,
who are you forgiving?

775
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,887
I just like to know
the details before
I make a toast.

776
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:53,655
Right. You and my dad
and, you know, others.

777
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,290
I see.

778
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,630
Well, I know you have
some issues with me,

779
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,764
but I'm curious,
what's he in for?

780
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,070
Before today,
nobody even knew
he existed.

781
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,577
Well, my parents divorced
when I was really young

782
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,512
and we don't spend
much time together
and I'd like to work on that.

783
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,982
Just like we
would like to work on

784
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,154
how you have
financial issues.

785
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,950
She's talking about
all the lending and
the borrowing and...

786
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,992
I know what she meant.

787
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,298
You are a beautiful woman,
but you are not
totally maxed out.

788
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,591
I would say,
honestly, you're a six.

789
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,533
Oh.
A six-and-a-half.

790
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,205
I could make you an 11.
Really?

791
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,298
When I found Deb, she was a 7.

792
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,803
And now she's a 12.

793
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,706
I wanna be a 12.

794
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,641
You can't be lazy.
I don't wanna be lazy.

795
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,907
Look at me.
You cannot be lazy.

796
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,241
I won't be lazy.

797
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,108
Do you know how
she got her body?
How?

798
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,949
Bodies by Jason.
Wow.

799
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,682
Say it.
Bodies by Jason.

800
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,990
Say it again.
Bodies by Jason.

801
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,784
And now just say, "Jason."
Jason.

802
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,153
Again.
Jason.

803
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,354
That sounds right, doesn't it?

804
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,187
Yeah.

805
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,958
What the fuck is
happening right now?

806
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,930
When was the last time
you two saw each other?
I'm curious.

807
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,270
Actually, we had
lunch together last week.
Uh-huh.

808
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:11,499
And before that?

809
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,242
It's been about seven years.

810
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,708
Seven years?
That's a joke, right?

811
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,906
That's like two Olympics.

812
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,340
But I'm the bad guy.

813
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,607
All right, Dad.

814
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:24,212
What Debbie doesn't
understand is it's not bad
to help out a parent.

815
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,281
And it's certainly
not bad for a parent
to help out a child.

816
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,456
I'm sure Oliver would agree.
Well...

817
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,720
Are you really
doing this right now?

818
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,820
Am I doing what?
I didn't start the toast.

819
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,090
Are you really
about to hit up
my dad for money?

820
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,234
What? He does four
operations a day.

821
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,131
It's perfect.
It helps everybody

822
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,967
and it relieves
his guilt from all
the abandonment issues.

823
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,564
You can't buy forgiveness.
Right, Pete?

824
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,575
I don't think anyone
is looking for handouts.
I mean, you know...

825
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,774
We'd pay him back.

826
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,146
If you two are in a bind,
I'd be more
than happy to help.

827
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,286
No. It's not good
to borrow money
from family members

828
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,886
because it
causes resentment.
Remember?

829
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,152
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

830
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:06,158
What do you
want me to do? Okay.
Admit that my life is shit?

831
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,955
Is that what you want
me to say? You happy?

832
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:11,490
Aren't I allowed a little joy
with these children I never
wanted to have?

833
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,239
You have never
once stopped
asking us for money.

834
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,600
Family helps family.

835
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,470
It's true.
Family helps family.

836
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,413
Look, I don't expect
you to fully understand.

837
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,906
Your dad left.
You're broken inside.

838
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,814
It's not your fault
you can't feel love.

839
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,210
There's something
that you can't...

840
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,550
This is coming out wrong.

841
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,956
You know what?
I would rather have
my dad than your dad.

842
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,595
Because he
doesn't drive me crazy.

843
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,598
You know what's
the best quality
my father has?

844
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,391
Is he asks for nothing.

845
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,300
I don't know what the fuck
he's thinking right now.

846
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,674
Look at that.
Nothing. Nothing.

847
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,034
I don't even know him.

848
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,671
And I turned out
perfectly fine
without his input, okay?

849
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,046
I just figured out
what your problem is.

850
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,050
You hate Jews.

851
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,615
Which is so odd
because your
children are Jewish.

852
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,055
Don't play
the Jew card, Larry.

853
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,591
I'm not playing
any Jew card.
Seriously, it's used up.

854
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,754
You can't use up a Jew card.
That's the whole
point of a Jew card.

855
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,364
That's right.
You can't use it up,
it goes forever.

856
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,694
You know what?
I have to go.

857
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,800
Yeah, great.
What a big surprise.

858
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,134
Bye, Oliver. See you later.
See you in
another seven years.

859
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,538
Make sure and say goodbye
to the grandkids
who you met today.

860
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,778
You know, nothing I do
is right because of you.

861
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:31,511
Nothing. No matter
how hard I try,
I'm just the asshole here.

862
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,174
But you know what?
You know what I realized?

863
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,912
It's you. You're the asshole.

864
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,778
Good luck
working that out.

865
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,513
Happy birthday,
and go fuck yourself.

866
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,784
Hey, see you when
the Cubs win the pennant.

867
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,589
I'm gonna go
light the candles.
Just get it going, okay?

868
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,726
Maybe we should
try the toast again.
You know, can you be quiet?

869
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,465
You just threw
me under the bus.

870
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,438
No, I don't...
You threw me under the...

871
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,039
You threw me under the bus.

872
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,273
We agreed to let go
and forgive,

873
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,903
but then you started
ripping into my dad
like a crazy person.

874
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,944
I'm not ripping into
your dad.

875
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,348
I'm just saying to him
what you say to me.

876
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,612
Don't be
such a ball-buster.

877
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,846
I am not a ball-buster.
You make me one.

878
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,892
I am a fun girl.
I am fun-loving.

879
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:18,660
I am a "Good-Time Sally."
I dance hip-hop.

880
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,897
I cannot believe l
have wasted my whole life

881
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,763
busting the balls
of people who have
no balls.

882
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,300
I'm the only one
here who has any balls!

883
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,372
God damn it.

884
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:16,744
Mom?

885
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,520
Mom? What are you doing?

886
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:22,616
What?

887
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,025
You're smoking,
and in the front yard?

888
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:28,031
No! No, they're Barb's.

889
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,459
Mom!

890
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,669
Since when have
you been a smoker?

891
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:34,828
I'm not a smoker.

892
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:36,396
I thought you
said smokers die.

893
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,600
I'm not smoking.
I wasn't smoking.

894
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,700
I saw you.

895
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,801
No, I wasn't.

896
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,345
Mom, you're smoking?

897
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,308
Deb, you can't smoke,
you're pregnant.
You've been doing so well.

898
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:46,543
You're pregnant?

899
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,411
No effing way.
I don't want
another sister.

900
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:50,715
I don't want her
as a sister.

901
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,586
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
It just slipped out.

902
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,255
Are you pregnant?
Since when
are you pregnant?

903
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:58,090
Since when do you care?
You don't even
want another baby.

904
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,929
You have no idea
what I want.

905
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,294
I want an Asian baby.

906
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,865
We're not gonna
have an Asian baby.

907
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:03,923
Yes, we are.

908
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,400
They're not Asian.
Sadie.

909
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,334
We'll buy one.
Shut up, Charlotte.

910
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:08,872
You shut up.
Shut up, Sadie!

911
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,530
Shut up, Charlotte!
Shut up!

912
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,675
Okay, Sadie, shut up.
Shut up, Charlotte!

913
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,402
Shut up!
Okay, stop saying "shut up"!

914
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,207
You're pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

915
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,446
When did you find out?

916
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:23,318
Will you stop
eating cupcakes, please?

917
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:28,019
Stop eating cupcakes!
Stop eating cupcakes!

918
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:35,698
Hey, we just heard.
You're having a baby?

919
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,528
See, it can happen to anybody.

920
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:39,570
That is so wonderful.

921
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:42,629
Let me give you a hug.
Fantastic, congratulations.

922
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:44,468
It's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.

923
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,109
This is too adult for you.
Let's go outside.

924
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,779
Congratulations.

925
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,645
Well, I guess
we're stuck together
then forever then, right?

926
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:57,745
Weren't we always?

927
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,150
You didn't even
want a baby.

928
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,224
Of course I do.
I never said that.

929
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,550
I didn't want one
if I could choose.

930
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:06,061
I should put that
on a Hallmark card.
That's beautiful.

931
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:07,455
Debbie...

932
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,964
Good luck with
the pregnancy, Debbie.

933
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,934
But please,
take care of yourself.

934
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,971
It's a much riskier
pregnancy after 40.

935
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,930
I'm not 40.
Of course you are.

936
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:19,074
You were born on
December 5th, 1972.

937
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:21,543
I'm not 40.
How do you know?

938
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:24,410
I was there. I'm the one
who took your mother
to the hospital.

939
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,810
Well, that's not
what she said.

940
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,417
Your mother was in labor
for only about 20 minutes

941
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:31,316
You couldn't wait to meet me.
Can you imagine that?

942
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,921
I don't even know you.

943
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:37,185
You can't just
come into my house
and reminisce.

944
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,487
Look, maybe we're
just not meant to be
in each other's lives.

945
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,527
I'm not sure this
was such a great idea.

946
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,137
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute!

947
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,137
You did leave and
you didn't come back.

948
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,971
My first life was ruined.
I did my best with my second.

949
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,581
So, I ruined your life?
I was eight.

950
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,583
People do better
when I stay out
of their lives!

951
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,913
That's what
my son tells me.

952
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,811
You think my
life is so perfect?

953
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:06,413
I've got a 13-year-old
who's a pothead.

954
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,517
I've got a wife who's
keeping Zoloft alive.

955
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,259
You never said that before.

956
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,422
You don't think I wanna
talk to you about this,
to share it with you?

957
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,433
It's just not our way.
We don't talk to each other.

958
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,629
We don't know each other.
And I thought that's
the way you wanted it.

959
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:22,966
How do I get out
of this?

960
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,908
How do I get you all
to just help me
down off the cross?

961
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,446
You sound just like Sadie.

962
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,638
Who's Sadie?

963
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,216
No, your daughter.
Your younger?

964
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:35,307
The big one.

965
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,822
Your older.
I know, I know that.
A wonderful girl.

966
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,456
Hey, guys,
some of us need to leave.

967
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,489
Would this be a good
moment to sneak out?

968
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,728
Where is Dad going?

969
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:02,507
Best birthday ever!

970
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,482
Oh, shit!

971
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,612
Bike lane, asshole!

972
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:14,886
Fuck you, you Twilight
pimply-ass motherfuckers!

973
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,826
Your dad's still here.

974
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,663
I know.
It's kind ofweird.

975
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,727
Where the hell is Pete?

976
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:24,893
Um...

977
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,799
Is it okay if Joseph
hangs out here for a while?

978
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,267
Mm-hmm.

979
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,499
Hi, Joseph.

980
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:33,967
Hi.

981
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,270
Do you want a piece of cake?

982
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:39,277
Oh! Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

983
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,546
All right, then.

984
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,618
They are so cute.

985
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,747
So cute.

986
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:48,223
He looks exactly
like Tom Petty.

987
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,289
Go around.

988
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,695
Watch it, watch it!

989
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,907
Hey, Pete! Great party!

990
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,239
Yeah.

991
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,745
The best!

992
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:15,713
And then we shake it.

993
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,016
And then
a restaurant comes up.

994
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:22,150
Dad, excuse me.
I'm gonna go look
for Pete right now.

995
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,022
Would you mind staying
with the girls for
just a little bit?

996
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,623
Well, ifyou want me to.

997
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,289
Ifyou don't mind.
You don't have to.

998
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:29,591
Sure.

999
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,628
Can I let Sadie
show me the last
episode of Lost?

1000
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:35,102
She asked me if l'd
seen it and I haven't.

1001
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,532
Yeah, that would be nice.

1002
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,738
Thank you.
Thank you.

1003
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,935
She said we could watch it.
Come on.

1004
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,209
I'm gonna let you
watch Lost. Come on.

1005
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,479
Is it scary?

1006
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,019
I'll cover your eyes
if it gets too scary.

1007
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,948
Are you mad at me?
Did I say something?

1008
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,286
Shh. Larry, please.

1009
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,465
Are you fucking kidding me?

1010
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,802
Are you fucking kidding me?

1011
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:50,605
You opened your door on me.

1012
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,341
I didn't open my
fucking door on you.
I opened my door!

1013
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:56,046
Aw, fuck.
I was right there!

1014
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,578
You're supposed to look
before you open your door!

1015
00:50:58,656 --> 00:50:59,953
I was in a fucking bike path!

1016
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:02,117
That's a blind spot.
There's no fucking bike path.

1017
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,456
It's a residential section.
Get your head out of your ass.

1018
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:05,552
Pay attention!

1019
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,187
Open your goddamn eyes.
What are you doing,
sleepwalking?

1020
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,863
You're supposed to look
to see if a biker's
coming through.

1021
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:11,959
You're supposed to look!

1022
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:14,402
It's not my job to
look out for you.
You look out for yourself.

1023
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,063
I don't look out for you.
I don't see you.

1024
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,333
I don't know
where the fuck you are
or what you're doing.

1025
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,739
No one is ever
looking out for me!

1026
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,241
I need your name
and your number.

1027
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,404
Why?

1028
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,505
Because you're
gonna pay for my door.

1029
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,738
Fuck you!

1030
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,251
Why don't you pay
for my bike and my face,
you fucking prick?

1031
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,217
Don't disrespect me.

1032
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:42,929
Are you sure
that's him?

1033
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,296
I don't think that's him.

1034
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:49,937
I gotta write down
your license plate.

1035
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,541
"Range Rover of Sunland."

1036
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,978
What are you doing?
Ow.

1037
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:13,090
I guess the party
didn't turn out
like you planned.

1038
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,231
It wasn't a good party.

1039
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,492
Hi.
Hi.

1040
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,196
I'll bring you in
as soon as his
X-rays are finished.

1041
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,862
Okay. Is he okay?
Okay.

1042
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,903
Yeah, he has a broken rib
and he's been crying
a little bit.

1043
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,636
But he'll be fine.

1044
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:32,274
You know, Pete was
never a real fighter.

1045
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,584
But that's why he married you.
That's why he loves you.

1046
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,621
Because you're
the fighter.

1047
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,748
And you need that.

1048
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,759
One person
in a relationship
has got to punch.

1049
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:45,925
Do you mean
that in a good way?

1050
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:49,122
Oh, it's a high compliment.

1051
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,762
Thanks.

1052
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,795
Listen, I know what
you're worried about.

1053
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,404
You think he's
gonna turn into me,

1054
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,809
but I don't think
it's gonna happen.

1055
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:04,104
He's smarter and
probably a little cuter.

1056
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,112
A little less Jew-y.

1057
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,781
Although after 50,
that's all gonna change.

1058
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,855
Be prepared to wake up
one day with a rabbi.

1059
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,124
But the good
news is, you know,

1060
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,623
he'll love you forever.

1061
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,391
That's in our DNA.

1062
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,424
We stick around.

1063
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,993
He worries
about you, you know.

1064
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:28,766
It puts a lot of
pressure on him.

1065
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:31,535
I know, I just don't have
anyone else to
talk to about it.

1066
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,041
Why don't you
talk to Claire?

1067
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,169
If I open up to her,
she'll leave me.

1068
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:36,640
No, she won't.

1069
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,544
Mmm.
Larry, she loves you.

1070
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,948
I know, but there's
a certain point at
which you just can't stay.

1071
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,846
I guess it's hard
to forgive somebody

1072
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:50,519
if they don't
formally apologize to you.

1073
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,127
Are you apologizing?

1074
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,362
I'm very close.

1075
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:02,629
Yes, I'm sorry.

1076
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,804
I'm glad everybody's okay.

1077
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,774
Okay, thanks.

1078
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,841
Oh, thank you.

1079
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,182
All right, I'm off.

1080
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,352
Okay.

1081
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,392
This is awkward.

1082
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,289
What?

1083
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,391
I need $40 for a cab.

1084
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,269
That's funny.

1085
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,064
No, I'm not kidding.

1086
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,697
Oh, yeah.

1087
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,670
You drove me, honey.
I wasn't prepared.

1088
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,002
I know.
I only have a hundred.

1089
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,103
It's okay.

1090
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,139
I'll bring you the change.

1091
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,318
All right.
Give him a kiss for me.

1092
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,664
I don't get it.

1093
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,506
See, it's not sad.

1094
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:16,602
It's happy, because
they helped each other
achieve their destiny.

1095
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:21,476
Great. I'm gonna have
some freaky-ass nightmares.

1096
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,426
Hi.
Hi.

1097
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,104
I really liked our
life so much better

1098
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,668
before we tried to
change everything.

1099
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,711
I'm sorry.

1100
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:56,051
No, I'm sorry.
I don't want to
keep anything from you.

1101
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,015
I love you, you're my wife.

1102
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,024
I just didn't
want to let you down.

1103
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,851
Are you mad
that I'm pregnant?

1104
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,825
No. I'm not mad,
I'm thrilled.

1105
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:09,425
You don't feel trapped?

1106
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,234
I sometimes feel
like I trapped you.

1107
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,792
I don't feel trapped.

1108
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,536
Really?
No.

1109
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,730
You should,
because I have trapped you.

1110
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:18,797
You can't go anywhere.

1111
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,437
I'm gonna get you pregnant
every 10 years for
the rest of your life.

1112
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,673
You can never leave me. Ever.

1113
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,510
I never feel trapped
by you.

1114
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,814
I'm so happy
to be with you and
I love you so much.

1115
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,255
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

1116
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,351
God damn it,
why am I crying
like this?

1117
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,283
Something is wrong
with me.

1118
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,889
You're pregnant.

1119
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,325
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:42,757
Shit.

1121
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,561
I was just outside
telling your dad
that I liked him.

1122
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:48,434
What if he
thinks I like him now?

1123
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:49,529
No, he won't think that.

1124
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,801
I don't want him to think
I like him that much.

1125
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,365
No, it will never happen.

1126
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:58,047
Can you believe it?
This is the craziest
thing ever.

1127
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:00,413
What are we gonna do
with a third baby?

1128
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:02,881
I have no idea.
How are we going to afford it?

1129
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:04,947
We'll sell the house.

1130
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,582
We don't have to.

1131
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:08,488
We kind of do.
We kind of do.

1132
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:10,887
We'll make new memories
in a new house.

1133
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:12,988
I love you.

1134
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,723
Is there anything
you want to do
for your birthday?

1135
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,962
It's been the worst
birthday ever.

1136
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:23,097
There is one thing,
but I don't
think you'll like it.

1137
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:24,669
What?

1138
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,073
I wouldn't mind
going to see some music.
Would you want to do that?

1139
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:29,369
Yeah.

1140
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,504
Really?
Yeah.

1141
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,775
I don't believe you,
but you're sweet
for saying that.

1142
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,845
How do we break
you out of here?

1143
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:37,681
I can just leave
on my own volition.
It's not a mental institution.

1144
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,850
Can you?
Yes.

1145
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,550
It's not like
One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest.

1146
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,823
Please don't put
a pillow over my face.

1147
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,791
Let's get outta here,
McMurphy.

1148
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:48,853
You got it, Chief.

1149
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,727
Will you carry me?

1150
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:53,602
You've been carrying me
all this time.

1151
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,795
Thanks.

1152
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,070
I like this song.

1153
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,106
Really?

1154
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:38,906
Why?

1155
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:45,578
Why don't you sign him?

1156
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:49,352
Ryan Adams?
No, he wouldn't sign with me.

1157
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,523
Why not? You're the best.

1158
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,153
He is in between labels.

1159
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:57,563
Let's go try and talk
to him after the show.

1160
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:51,245
Thank you.

1161
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:27,557
I'm sorry if I'm not
all fancy pants
and wealthy

1162
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:31,149
and showing it all off
with my Vidal
Sassoon haircuts.

1163
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:32,752
Sorry.

1164
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,587
Quit slow-blinking at me.

1165
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:36,396
I'm sorry.
Okay...

1166
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:40,059
I would like to rear
up and jackknife my legs

1167
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,105
and kick you both
in the fucking jaw
with my foot bone.

1168
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,468
That's what l
would fucking love.

1169
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:51,071
I wish my fucking foot
would go right
through your skull.

1170
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,548
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

1171
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:55,778
I will fucking kill you.

1172
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,781
You corner me,
I will fucking
chew through you.

1173
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,149
I'll chew through you!

1174
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:03,952
Slow-blinking eyes.
I will chew off
your fucking eyelids.

1175
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,953
You won't
slow-blink at me,
will you?

1176
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,791
Did you drink
before you came here?

1177
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,923
No, but I'm gonna
start drinking.

1178
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,567
I'm gonna slit somebody
open like a fish
and drink their blood.

1179
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:14,934
That's what I'm gonna drink

1180
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,163
ifwe don't start
getting to
the fucking point here.

1181
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,838
Probably I'm gonna start
with Karen Carpenter's head.

1182
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:25,039
I'm gonna rip her head off
and I'm gonna drink her blood.

1183
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,248
And then I'm gonna come back
and light you on fire.

1184
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,050
I'm gonna light
you all on fire.

1185
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,985
But I'm gonna
start with you, Jill.

1186
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,882
I'm gonna
fucking torch you.

1187
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:37,321
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go buy
a fucking pickup truck.

1188
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,587
And a cord of rope.

1189
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:40,857
And I'm gonna string it
around all three of
your fucking necks

1190
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,762
and then drive
around town, dragging you.

1191
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,093
That's what I'm
gonna fucking do.

1192
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,397
That's completely
uncalled for.

1193
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:49,230
Really, Jill?
Do you think it is?

1194
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,667
Fuck off, Jill.
God, everybody
fucking hates you.

1195
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,367
God!

1196
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,468
That isn't even nice.

1197
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,705
Go suck a big
fucking dick, Jill.

1198
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:00,915
That's totally
uncalled for, Catherine.

1199
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,282
You're a fucking asshole.
Everybody hates you.

1200
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,580
They hate your fucking bob.

1201
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,882
And I'm glad
your husband died.

1202
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,288
Because you're
a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

1203
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,219
I would. Kill myself.

1204
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,193
God, I'd kill myself, Jill.

1205
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,270
Cut!
