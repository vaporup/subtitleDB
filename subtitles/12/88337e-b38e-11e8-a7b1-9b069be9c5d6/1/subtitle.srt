2
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:20,588
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

3
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:30,802
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

4
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:41,510
Go back to the Shadow.

5
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,216
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

6
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:54,583
You shall not pass!

7
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,415
No! No!

8
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,591
Gandalf!

9
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,928
Fly, you fools.

10
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:37,433
No!

11
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:41,464
Gandalf!

12
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,973
Gandalf!

13
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,207
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

14
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,877
Nothing.

15
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:08,216
Just a dream.

16
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:22,599
Can you see the bottom?

17
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:27,002
No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!

18
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,982
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,062
Mr. Frodo!

20
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,394
I think I've found the bottom.

21
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,797
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

22
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,205
It's not natural. None of it.

23
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,373
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

24
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,809
Just a bit of seasoning.

25
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,217
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.

26
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,986
Roast chicken?!

27
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:16,854
You never know.

28
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:20,262
Sam. My dear Sam.

29
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,901
It's very special, that. It's
the best salt in all the Shire.

30
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,161
It is special.

31
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,942
It's a little bit of home.

32
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,682
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.

33
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:44,642
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

34
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:49,322
It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that.

35
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,960
Real Elvish rope.

36
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,263
Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.

37
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,399
Won't come free in a hurry.

38
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,402
Real Elvish rope.

39
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:27,052
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

40
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,424
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

41
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,928
It's just where we can't get.

42
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,337
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

43
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:41,438
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

44
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:46,377
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

45
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,716
...but they did.

46
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,762
Mr. Frodo?

47
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,100
It's the Ring, isn't it?

48
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:11,671
It's getting heavier.

49
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,048
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

50
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,847
Oh, yes. Lovely.

51
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,788
Lembas bread. And look!

52
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,493
More lembas bread.

53
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,210
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

54
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:53,403
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

55
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:57,740
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

56
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,855
Those rain clouds might.

57
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,924
This looks strangely familiar.

58
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,021
It's because we've been here before.

59
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,759
We're going in circles.

60
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,367
What is that horrid stink?

61
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,733
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

62
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,841
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

63
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,107
I can smell it.

64
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,784
We're not alone.

65
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:23,527
The thieves. The thieves.

66
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:27,661
The filthy little thieves.

67
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,501
Where is it?

68
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:33,372
Where is it?

69
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,276
They stole it from us.

70
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:41,681
My precious.

71
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,819
Curse them, we hates them!

72
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:50,087
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

73
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:46,980
This is Sting.

74
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,675
You've seen it before...

75
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,354
haven't you, Gollum?

76
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:58,918
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

77
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,708
It burns!

78
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,211
It burns us!

79
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:22,151
It freezes!

80
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,218
Nasty Elves twisted it.

81
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,051
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

82
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:36,728
It's hopeless. Every Orc in
Mordor's going to hear this racket.

83
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,494
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

84
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,261
That would kill us! Kill us!

85
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,136
It's no more than you deserve!

86
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:49,869
Maybe he does deserve to die.

87
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:55,718
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

88
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:04,024
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

89
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:07,025
Take it off us.

90
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:14,069
We swears to do what you wants.

91
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:16,171
We swears.

92
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,907
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

93
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,339
We swears...

94
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:28,345
to serve the master of the precious.

95
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,317
We will swear on...

96
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:34,456
on the precious.

97
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,818
Gollum. Gollum.

98
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:41,122
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

99
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,295
Yes...

100
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,357
on the precious.

101
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:51,171
On the precious.

102
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:53,831
I don't believe you!

103
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:59,336
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

104
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:01,277
He's trying to trick us.

105
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,442
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

106
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:20,392
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

107
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:25,067
You've been there before?

108
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,666
Yes.

109
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,214
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

110
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:53,665
To the Gate, to the Gate! To
the Gate, the master says. Yes!

111
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:58,636
No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him.

112
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:03,038
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

113
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:06,680
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.

114
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:12,842
No. Ashes and dust and thirst
there is, and pits, pits, pits.

115
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,888
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

116
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:21,188
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.

117
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,964
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

118
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,600
There! What did I tell you?

119
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,003
He's run off, the old villain.

120
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,699
So much for his promises.

121
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,469
This way, Hobbits.

122
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,771
Follow me!

123
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,028
Merry!

124
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,488
Merry!

125
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,771
You're late. Our master grows impatient.

126
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,772
He wants the Shire-rats now.

127
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:16,241
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

128
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,344
Saruman will have his prize.

129
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,717
We will deliver them.

130
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,294
Merry!

131
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,794
Merry? Wake up.

132
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,134
My friend is sick.

133
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,234
He needs water. Please!

134
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,944
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

135
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,843
Stop it!

136
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,681
Can't take his draught!

137
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,918
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

138
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,827
You want some?

139
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,931
Then keep your mouth shut.

140
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,363
Merry.

141
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,764
Hello, Pip.

142
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,045
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

143
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,704
- It was just an act.
- An act?

144
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,250
See? I fooled you too.

145
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,684
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

146
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,983
What is it? What do you smell?

147
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,258
Man-flesh.

148
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,764
They've picked up our trail.

149
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:44,994
Aragorn.

150
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,535
Let's move!

151
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,621
Their pace has quickened.

152
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,601
They must have caught our scent.

153
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,532
Hurry!

154
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,937
Come on, Gimli!

155
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,078
Three days and nights pursuit.

156
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:34,218
No food. No rest.

157
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:38,377
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.

158
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,983
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

159
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,690
They may yet be alive.

160
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,156
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

161
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:25,257
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

162
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:29,735
I'm wasted on cross-country. We
Dwarves are natural sprinters.

163
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,539
Very dangerous over short distances.

164
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:47,017
Rohan.

165
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:49,987
Home of the Horse-lords.

166
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:53,753
There's something strange at work here.

167
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,899
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

168
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,035
Sets its will against us.

169
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:08,108
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

170
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,837
The Uruks turn northeast.

171
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,842
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

172
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:15,979
Saruman.

173
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:27,590
The world is changing.

174
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:33,360
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

175
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,800
and Mordor?

176
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:44,138
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...

177
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:47,941
and the union of the two towers?

178
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:57,425
Together, my Lord Sauron...

179
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:01,119
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

180
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:21,478
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.

181
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,315
The forests will fall.

182
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:30,089
A new order will rise.

183
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,062
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

184
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:40,190
and the iron fists of the Orc.

185
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:55,944
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!

186
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,743
But, my lord, there are too many!

187
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,944
They cannot all be armed in
time, we don't have the means.

188
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:04,181
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

189
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:07,191
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.

190
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:12,828
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

191
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:16,600
- Burn it.
- Yes.

192
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:19,635
We will fight for you.

193
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:21,775
Swear it.

194
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:37,053
We will die for Saruman.

195
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:40,149
The Horse-Men took your lands.

196
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:44,855
They drove your people into the
hills to scratch a living off rocks.

197
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:46,465
Murderers!

198
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,493
Take back the lands they stole from you.

199
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:51,465
Burn every village!

200
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:59,838
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

201
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,838
It will begin in Rohan.

202
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,110
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

203
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,083
But no more.

204
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,519
Eothain! Eothain!

205
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,355
You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.

206
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,391
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

207
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,226
He is too big for him.

208
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:24,403
Listen to me. You must ride
to Edoras and raise the alarm.

209
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,095
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

210
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:30,307
I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.

211
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:34,207
Freda, I will find you there.

212
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:40,813
Quickly!

213
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:48,784
Go, child.

214
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,573
Rohan, my lord...

215
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:06,772
is ready to fall.

216
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,547
Theodred.

217
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,385
Find the king's son!

218
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:43,873
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

219
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:47,616
My Lord Eomer, over here!

220
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:58,224
He's alive.

221
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:31,119
Theodred.

222
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:47,534
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

223
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,436
He was ambushed by Orcs.

224
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:55,611
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

225
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:58,476
That is a lie.

226
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,491
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

227
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,154
Grima.

228
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,534
Grima.

229
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:16,561
Grima.

230
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:20,433
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

231
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:24,438
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

232
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:28,015
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

233
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:41,626
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

234
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,299
Can you not see?

235
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:49,495
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

236
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:52,231
your warmongering.

237
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:56,412
Warmongering?

238
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:58,740
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

239
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,947
What was the promised price, Grima?

240
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:05,779
When all the Men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

241
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:20,894
Too long have you watched my sister.

242
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,071
Too long have you haunted her steps.

243
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:35,480
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

244
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,810
Too much.

245
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:43,955
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...

246
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:48,927
and all its domains under pain of death.

247
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,730
You have no authority here.

248
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,368
Your orders mean nothing.

249
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:58,737
This order does not come from me.

250
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:01,068
It comes from the king.

251
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:04,269
He signed it this morning.

252
00:27:35,843 --> 00:27:38,539
Keep breathing. That's the key.

253
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:40,474
Breathe.

254
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:48,419
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

255
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:06,597
We're not going no further...

256
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:08,764
until we've had a breather.

257
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,277
Get a fire going!

258
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:16,906
Merry!

259
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:18,614
Merry!

260
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,519
I think we might have made a
mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

261
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,196
What's making that noise?

262
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,238
It's the trees.

263
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:42,032
What?

264
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:46,209
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

265
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:50,873
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

266
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,574
and come alive.

267
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,514
Alive?

268
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:57,083
Trees that could whisper...

269
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:00,559
talk to each other...

270
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:02,524
even move.

271
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:06,394
I'm starving.

272
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:10,626
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

273
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,265
Yeah!

274
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:15,736
Why can't we have some meat?!

275
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,305
What about them?

276
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,379
They're fresh.

277
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:26,814
They are not for eating.

278
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,759
What about their legs?

279
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,258
They don't need those.

280
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,927
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

281
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:48,638
The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.

282
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,941
Alive?

283
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:58,178
Why alive? Do they give good sport?

284
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:03,953
They have something. An Elvish weapon.

285
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:07,148
The master wants it for the war.

286
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:11,927
They think we have the Ring.

287
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,530
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

288
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,368
Just a mouthful...

289
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:19,730
a bit of the flank.

290
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:30,105
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

291
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:37,983
Pippin.

292
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,850
Let's go.

293
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,789
Go on.

294
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,468
Call for help.

295
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,962
Squeal.

296
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,334
No one's going to save you now.

297
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:07,916
Pippin!

298
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,699
A red sun rises.

299
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:38,146
Blood has been spilled this night.

300
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:11,177
Riders of Rohan...

301
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:14,048
what news from the Mark?

302
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,213
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

303
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,277
Speak quickly!

304
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:53,281
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

305
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,956
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

306
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,767
if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

307
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,863
You would die before your stroke fell.

308
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,481
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

309
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:26,014
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and
Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

310
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:29,418
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

311
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,925
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

312
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,358
Not even his own kin.

313
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:43,837
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

314
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,939
and claimed lordship over these lands.

315
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,901
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

316
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:52,841
And for that, we are banished.

317
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,215
The White Wizard is cunning.

318
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:01,286
He walks here and there, they say...

319
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,423
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

320
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,125
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

321
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,527
We are no spies.

322
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,634
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

323
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:17,268
They have taken two of our friends captive.

324
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:20,540
The Uruks are destroyed. We
slaughtered them during the night.

325
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,871
But there were two Hobbits. Did
you see two Hobbits with them?

326
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,013
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

327
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,341
We left none alive.

328
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,955
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

329
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:42,656
Dead?

330
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:47,360
I am sorry.

331
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:55,237
Hasufel! Arod!

332
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:01,707
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

333
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,508
Farewell.

334
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:11,953
Look for your friends.

335
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:14,655
But do not trust to hope.

336
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,923
It has forsaken these lands.

337
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:21,123
We ride north!

338
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,548
It's one of their wee belts.

339
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:29,391
We failed them.

340
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,609
A Hobbit lay here.

341
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,145
And the other.

342
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,556
They crawled.

343
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,763
Their hands were bound.

344
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:21,748
Their bonds were cut.

345
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:39,361
They ran over here.

346
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:44,200
They were followed.

347
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:49,140
The belt!

348
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,176
Run!

349
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,252
Tracks lead away from the battle...

350
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:06,154
into Fangorn Forest.

351
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:08,497
Fangorn?

352
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,293
What madness drove them in there?

353
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:32,044
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

354
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:42,197
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

355
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:49,426
Come here!

356
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:57,504
Trees. Climb a tree.

357
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,551
He's gone.

358
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:22,968
Merry!

359
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,853
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

360
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,518
Run, Merry!

361
00:39:57,305 --> 00:40:01,639
Little Orcs.

362
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,142
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

363
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:06,212
Tree?

364
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:09,373
I am no tree!

365
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,778
I am an Ent.

366
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:14,480
A tree-herder.

367
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:17,024
A shepherd of the forest.

368
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:18,557
Don't talk to it, Merry.

369
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,527
Don't encourage it!

370
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:24,960
Treebeard, some call me.

371
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,101
And whose side are you on?

372
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:29,329
Side?

373
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:32,404
I am on nobody's side...

374
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:38,110
because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

375
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:43,543
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

376
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:46,351
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

377
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,818
Hobbits?

378
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:54,926
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

379
00:40:56,129 --> 00:41:00,623
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

380
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:02,928
They come with fire.

381
00:41:03,136 --> 00:41:05,696
They come with axes.

382
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:10,707
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

383
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:14,711
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

384
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,781
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

385
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:19,782
Halflings!

386
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,045
Shire-folk!

387
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:23,587
Maybe you are...

388
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:27,520
and maybe you aren't.

389
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:32,531
The White Wizard will know.

390
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,267
The White Wizard?

391
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:38,293
Saruman.

392
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,544
See? See?

393
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:55,185
We've led you out.

394
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:57,845
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

395
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,428
Very lucky we find you.

396
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:11,831
Nice Hobbit.

397
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,005
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

398
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:20,805
A swamp, yes, yes.

399
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,279
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

400
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:32,057
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

401
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,956
I found it. I did.

402
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,826
The way through the marshes.

403
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:44,525
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

404
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:48,798
They go around for miles and miles.

405
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,441
Come quickly.

406
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:54,703
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

407
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,213
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

408
00:42:59,384 --> 00:43:01,648
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.

409
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,187
No, no birdses to eat.

410
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:09,655
No crunchable birdses.

411
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:13,128
We are famished! Yes!

412
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:17,598
Famished we are, precious!

413
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,074
Here.

414
00:43:35,286 --> 00:43:37,277
What does it eats?

415
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,457
Is it tasty?

416
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:47,357
It tries to chokes us!

417
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:51,295
We can't eats Hobbit food!

418
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:57,030
We must starve!

419
00:43:57,207 --> 00:43:59,573
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

420
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:02,539
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

421
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:05,579
It does not care if we be hungry.

422
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:10,549
Does not care if we should die.

423
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:14,021
Not like master.

424
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:17,485
Master cares.

425
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:20,527
Master knows.

426
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,968
Yes.

427
00:44:25,135 --> 00:44:27,763
Precious.

428
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:34,970
Once it takes hold of us...

429
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:41,011
it never lets go.

430
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:42,878
Don't touch me!

431
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:17,216
There are dead things!

432
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:19,149
Dead faces in the water.

433
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:27,952
All dead. All rotten.

434
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:32,230
Elves and Men and Orcses.

435
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:36,064
A great battle long ago.

436
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:38,602
Dead Marshes.

437
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:41,538
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

438
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:44,975
This way.

439
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:47,945
Don't follow the lights.

440
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:53,553
Careful now! Or Hobbits go
down to join the dead ones...

441
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:57,852
and light little candles of their own.

442
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:25,519
Frodo!

443
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:14,661
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

444
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,700
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

445
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,735
Are you all right?

446
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:50,604
So bright.

447
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:54,604
So beautiful.

448
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:58,643
Our precious.

449
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:01,604
What did you say?

450
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:03,976
Master should be resting.

451
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:08,211
Master needs to keep up his strength.

452
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:13,454
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

453
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,116
Gollum. Gollum.

454
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,092
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

455
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:21,359
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

456
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:23,092
He said your life was a sad story.

457
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:27,831
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

458
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:30,999
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

459
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,939
Were you?

460
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:37,411
Smeagol.

461
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,646
What did you call me?

462
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:48,756
That was your name once, wasn't it?

463
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,695
A long time ago.

464
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,693
My name.

465
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:57,258
My name.

466
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:06,611
Smeagol.

467
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,376
Black Riders!

468
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,882
Hide! Hide!

469
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,761
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

470
00:49:26,932 --> 00:49:30,561
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

471
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,998
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

472
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:37,141
No, you cannot kill them. No.

473
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,394
Wraiths!

474
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:07,799
Wraiths on wings!

475
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,838
They are calling for it.

476
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:21,609
They are calling for the precious.

477
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,881
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

478
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,318
I'm here.

479
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,864
Hurry, Hobbits.

480
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:49,379
The Black Gate is very close.

481
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,118
Orc blood.

482
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,828
These are strange tracks.

483
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,126
The air is so close in here.

484
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,704
This forest is old.

485
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,498
Very old.

486
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:23,575
Full of memory...

487
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:28,514
and anger.

488
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,592
The trees are speaking to each other.

489
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,250
Gimli!

490
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,363
Lower your ax.

491
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,931
They have feelings, my friend.

492
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,461
The Elves began it.

493
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:54,405
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.

494
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,277
Talking trees.

495
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,940
What do trees have to talk about?

496
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,280
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

497
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,667
The White Wizard approaches.

498
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:31,175
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.

499
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:43,020
We must be quick.

500
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:02,236
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

501
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,210
Where are they?

502
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:07,940
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

503
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:12,382
They met someone they did not expect.

504
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:14,681
Does that comfort you?

505
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:16,824
Who are you?

506
00:53:18,293 --> 00:53:20,261
Show yourself!

507
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,161
It cannot be.

508
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:35,108
Forgive me.

509
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,711
I mistook you for Saruman.

510
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,244
I am Saruman.

511
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:47,652
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

512
00:53:48,623 --> 00:53:50,113
You fell.

513
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:54,117
Through fire...

514
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:55,592
and water.

515
00:53:57,064 --> 00:53:59,589
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

516
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:03,464
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

517
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,050
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

518
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:26,682
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

519
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:35,259
Darkness took me...

520
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:40,097
and I strayed out of thought and time.

521
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:43,934
Stars wheeled overhead...

522
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,704
and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.

523
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,977
But it was not the end.

524
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:56,052
I felt life in me again.

525
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:00,516
I've been sent back...

526
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:02,252
until my task is done.

527
00:55:02,629 --> 00:55:04,529
Gandalf.

528
00:55:05,198 --> 00:55:07,189
Gandalf?

529
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,397
Yes.

530
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:14,002
That was what they used to call me.

531
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:19,140
Gandalf the Grey.

532
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,243
That was my name.

533
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:23,848
Gandalf.

534
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:27,878
I am Gandalf the White.

535
00:55:30,923 --> 00:55:33,983
And I come back to you now...

536
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:36,650
at the turn of the tide.

537
00:55:37,763 --> 00:55:40,732
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.

538
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,663
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

539
00:55:45,604 --> 00:55:47,629
That is no short distance!

540
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:51,137
We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.

541
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,403
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

542
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:57,015
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

543
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:59,173
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

544
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:03,515
in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

545
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,288
I mean, charming...

546
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:12,191
quite charming forest.

547
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:16,394
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

548
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:20,971
A great power has been sleeping
here for many long years.

549
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,576
The coming of Merry and Pippin will
be like the falling of small stones...

550
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:28,076
that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

551
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:31,239
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.

552
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,010
You still speak in riddles.

553
00:56:37,855 --> 00:56:44,260
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days.

554
00:56:44,428 --> 00:56:48,057
The Ents are going to wake up...

555
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,093
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

556
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:55,031
Oh, that's good.

557
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:57,935
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

558
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:01,273
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

559
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:05,040
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.

560
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:08,947
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

561
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:32,675
That is one of the Mearas...

562
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:35,641
unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

563
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:55,527
Shadowfax.

564
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:00,729
He is the lord of all horses...

565
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:06,240
and has been my friend through many dangers.

566
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:24,085
O rowan mine

567
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:28,061
I saw you shine

568
00:58:28,231 --> 00:58:31,758
Upon a summer's day

569
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:37,329
Upon your head How golden-red

570
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,272
The crown you bore aloft

571
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:44,844
Such a beautiful verse.

572
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:49,917
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

573
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:53,350
You might call it far, perhaps.

574
00:58:54,256 --> 00:58:58,056
My home lies deep in the forest...

575
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,162
near the roots of the mountain.

576
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:07,095
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

577
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:11,295
And safe is where I'll keep you.

578
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:15,942
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

579
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,337
It's one of my own compositions.

580
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,709
Right.

581
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:27,015
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

582
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:32,058
And the dreams of trees unfold

583
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:38,689
When woodland halls are green and cool

584
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:42,961
And the wind is in the West

585
00:59:43,438 --> 00:59:46,100
Come back to me

586
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:51,101
Come back to me

587
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:57,707
And say my land is best

588
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,822
Sleep, little Shirelings.

589
01:00:08,997 --> 01:00:12,592
Heed no nightly noise.

590
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,702
Sleep till morning light.

591
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:22,503
I have business in the forest.

592
01:00:22,677 --> 01:00:28,206
There are many to call. Many that must come.

593
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:34,114
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

594
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:40,124
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

595
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:53,835
The veiling shadow that
glowers in the east takes shape.

596
01:00:54,641 --> 01:00:57,235
Sauron will suffer no rival.

597
01:00:57,677 --> 01:01:01,943
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

598
01:01:02,115 --> 01:01:05,482
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.

599
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,488
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

600
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:11,215
The rumor has reached him.

601
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:14,360
The heir of Numenor still lives.

602
01:01:15,328 --> 01:01:18,161
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

603
01:01:19,499 --> 01:01:21,660
He fears what you may become.

604
01:01:22,936 --> 01:01:26,372
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.

605
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,169
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.

606
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:31,833
War is coming.

607
01:01:32,012 --> 01:01:35,573
Rohan must defend itself, and
therein lies our first challenge...

608
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:38,183
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

609
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:42,048
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

610
01:01:42,222 --> 01:01:45,316
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

611
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:50,190
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.

612
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,157
But for all their cunning...

613
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:55,890
we have one advantage.

614
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,630
The Ring remains hidden.

615
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,574
And that we should seek to destroy it...

616
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:06,711
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

617
01:02:07,313 --> 01:02:10,612
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

618
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:12,273
in the hands of a Hobbit.

619
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:16,547
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.

620
01:02:16,722 --> 01:02:19,350
We must trust now in Frodo.

621
01:02:19,525 --> 01:02:21,356
Everything depends upon speed...

622
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,519
and the secrecy of his quest.

623
01:02:26,499 --> 01:02:29,832
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

624
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:33,467
Frodo must finish this task alone.

625
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:36,538
He's not alone.

626
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:38,404
Sam went with him.

627
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:40,272
Did he?

628
01:02:40,446 --> 01:02:45,076
Did he, indeed? Good.

629
01:02:45,684 --> 01:02:48,118
Yes, very good.

630
01:02:56,127 --> 01:03:01,030
The Black Gate of Mordor.

631
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:06,236
Oh, save us.

632
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:15,274
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.

633
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:21,975
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

634
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:25,589
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

635
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:26,985
I did.

636
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:37,758
That's it, then.

637
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:40,634
We can't get past that.

638
01:04:25,816 --> 01:04:27,147
Look!

639
01:04:27,317 --> 01:04:28,784
The gate.

640
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:30,146
It's opening!

641
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:39,562
I can see a way down.

642
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:42,390
Sam, no!

643
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:45,966
Master!

644
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:13,278
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

645
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:17,218
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

646
01:06:17,659 --> 01:06:19,524
- Now!
- No!

647
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:22,063
No! No, master!

648
01:06:22,263 --> 01:06:25,232
They catch you! They catch you!

649
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:29,094
Don't take it to him.

650
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,770
He wants the precious.

651
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:37,969
Always he is looking for it.

652
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:42,048
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

653
01:06:42,283 --> 01:06:46,185
But we mustn't let him have it.

654
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:54,687
No! There's another way.

655
01:06:54,896 --> 01:06:57,558
More secret. A dark way.

656
01:06:57,866 --> 01:07:01,529
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

657
01:07:02,003 --> 01:07:03,026
He's up to something.

658
01:07:03,637 --> 01:07:06,231
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

659
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:09,137
Yes. There's a path...

660
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:11,800
and some stairs.

661
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,673
And then...

662
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:17,180
a tunnel.

663
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:32,995
He's led us this far, Sam.

664
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:34,566
Mr. Frodo, no.

665
01:07:35,702 --> 01:07:37,169
He's been true to his word.

666
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:43,236
No.

667
01:07:45,379 --> 01:07:47,006
Lead the way, Smeagol.

668
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:51,550
Good Smeagol always helps.

669
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,507
Hello?

670
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:30,980
Treebeard?

671
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,022
Where has he gone?

672
01:08:33,226 --> 01:08:35,660
I had the loveliest dream last night.

673
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:38,991
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

674
01:08:39,165 --> 01:08:41,656
And we smoked all of it. And then...

675
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,102
you were sick.

676
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,538
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

677
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,978
Did you hear that?

678
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,452
There it is again.

679
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,985
Something's not right here. Not right at all.

680
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:14,731
You just said something... Treeish.

681
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,893
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

682
01:09:26,444 --> 01:09:28,309
You're taller.

683
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:30,337
- Who?
- You!

684
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:32,142
- Than what?
- Than me!

685
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:34,778
I've always been taller than you.

686
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:39,583
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the
tall one. You're the short one.

687
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,948
Please, Merry.

688
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,994
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

689
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:49,398
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

690
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:53,800
3'8"!

691
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,571
Three-foot-eight.

692
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:02,545
You did something.

693
01:10:08,353 --> 01:10:09,945
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

694
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:12,355
Merry!

695
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:14,888
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.

696
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:18,961
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

697
01:10:19,129 --> 01:10:21,290
Give me it back. Merry!

698
01:10:23,133 --> 01:10:24,498
What's happening?!

699
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:26,836
It's got my leg!

700
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,661
Merry!

701
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,650
Help!

702
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:58,298
Away with you.

703
01:10:58,469 --> 01:11:00,266
You should not be waking.

704
01:11:00,771 --> 01:11:05,640
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

705
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:08,803
Go to sleep.

706
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:11,011
Away with you.

707
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:14,480
Come, the forest is waking up.

708
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:16,985
It isn't safe.

709
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:23,592
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

710
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,752
Anger festers in their hearts.

711
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,257
Black are their thoughts.

712
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:31,957
Strong is their hate.

713
01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:34,899
They will harm you if they can.

714
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:38,632
There are too few of us now.

715
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:42,801
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

716
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:46,074
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

717
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:49,446
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

718
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:55,251
There have been no Entings for
a terrible long count of years.

719
01:11:55,458 --> 01:12:00,691
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

720
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,362
Oh, I'm sorry.

721
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:06,401
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

722
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:09,800
We lost them.

723
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:15,035
And now we cannot find them.

724
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:21,445
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

725
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,398
Can't say that I have.

726
01:12:24,942 --> 01:12:26,967
You, Pip?

727
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:30,845
What do they look like?

728
01:12:33,283 --> 01:12:37,947
I don't remember now.

729
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:58,273
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

730
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,670
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

731
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:05,246
whose mind is overthrown.

732
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:09,681
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

733
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,483
My lord, your son...

734
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:15,852
he is dead.

735
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:19,158
My lord?

736
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,590
Uncle?

737
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,668
Will you not go to him?

738
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,209
Will you do nothing?

739
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,347
Be careful what you say.

740
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,708
Do not look for welcome here.

741
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,904
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

742
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,238
What a tragedy for the king...

743
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,449
to lose his only son and heir.

744
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:20,079
I understand. His passing is hard to accept.

745
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:25,158
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

746
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:26,793
Leave me alone, snake!

747
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,890
Oh, but you are alone.

748
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:36,300
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

749
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:39,929
in the bitter watches of the night...

750
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,771
when all your life seems to shrink.

751
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:48,176
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

752
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:52,911
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

753
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:57,056
So fair.

754
01:14:58,326 --> 01:14:59,691
So cold.

755
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,624
Like a morning of pale spring...

756
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,268
still clinging to winter's chill.

757
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,540
Your words are poison.

758
01:16:56,108 --> 01:16:58,576
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

759
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:16,725
I cannot allow you before Theoden
King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

760
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:20,791
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

761
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:39,912
Your staff.

762
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:46,813
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

763
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:08,477
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

764
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:18,346
He's a herald of woe.

765
01:18:18,523 --> 01:18:22,960
The courtesy of your hall is
somewhat lessened of late...

766
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:25,495
Theoden King.

767
01:18:26,197 --> 01:18:28,722
He's not welcome.

768
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:35,004
Why should I welcome you...

769
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:39,169
Gandalf Stormcrow?

770
01:18:39,343 --> 01:18:42,642
A just question, my liege.

771
01:18:42,813 --> 01:18:45,680
Late is the hour...

772
01:18:45,849 --> 01:18:49,808
in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

773
01:18:50,621 --> 01:18:52,680
Lathspell I name him.

774
01:18:52,856 --> 01:18:55,757
Ill news is an ill guest.

775
01:18:55,926 --> 01:19:00,488
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

776
01:19:00,664 --> 01:19:02,598
I have not passed through fire and death...

777
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,931
to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

778
01:19:06,937 --> 01:19:09,030
His staff.

779
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:13,369
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

780
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:18,648
Theoden...

781
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:21,776
son of Thengel...

782
01:19:23,554 --> 01:19:25,920
too long have you sat in the Shadows.

783
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:32,157
I would stay still if I were you.

784
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:34,422
Hearken to me!

785
01:19:39,937 --> 01:19:42,063
I release you...

786
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:44,239
from the spell.

787
01:19:55,785 --> 01:19:58,811
You have no power here...

788
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:02,617
Gandalf the Grey.

789
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:13,093
I will draw you, Saruman, as
poison is drawn from a wound.

790
01:20:22,545 --> 01:20:24,069
Wait.

791
01:20:25,515 --> 01:20:29,349
If I go, Theoden dies.

792
01:20:30,052 --> 01:20:32,247
You did not kill me...

793
01:20:32,422 --> 01:20:34,617
you will not kill him.

794
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:40,223
Rohan is mine.

795
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:43,028
Be gone.

796
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:29,669
I know your face.

797
01:21:34,249 --> 01:21:35,511
Eowyn.

798
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:39,081
Eowyn.

799
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:48,555
Gandalf?

800
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:51,963
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

801
01:22:05,312 --> 01:22:07,906
Dark have been my dreams of late.

802
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:15,818
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

803
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,959
if they grasped your sword.

804
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,038
I've only...

805
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,299
ever served you, my lord.

806
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:14,469
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

807
01:23:15,481 --> 01:23:17,415
Send me not from your sight.

808
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:22,449
No, my lord! No, my lord.

809
01:23:22,655 --> 01:23:23,849
Let him go.

810
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:27,788
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

811
01:23:36,936 --> 01:23:39,268
Get out of my way!

812
01:23:41,507 --> 01:23:44,670
Hail, Theoden King!

813
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:11,758
Where is Theodred?

814
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:17,366
Where is my son?

815
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:46,291
Simbelmyn?

816
01:25:51,469 --> 01:25:55,064
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.

817
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:01,877
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

818
01:26:03,947 --> 01:26:07,815
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

819
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:12,988
The young perish and the old linger.

820
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,683
That I should live...

821
01:26:15,859 --> 01:26:19,226
to see the last days of my house.

822
01:26:20,497 --> 01:26:24,365
Theodred's death was not of your making.

823
01:26:27,403 --> 01:26:30,804
No parent should have to bury their child.

824
01:26:47,524 --> 01:26:49,389
He was strong in life.

825
01:26:50,493 --> 01:26:54,054
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

826
01:27:38,674 --> 01:27:40,574
They had no warning.

827
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:43,142
They were unarmed.

828
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:47,639
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

829
01:27:48,584 --> 01:27:50,552
Rick, cot and tree.

830
01:27:50,853 --> 01:27:53,083
Where is Mama?

831
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:58,088
This is but a taste of the
terror that Saruman will unleash.

832
01:27:58,293 --> 01:28:02,627
All the more potent for he is
driven now by fear of Sauron.

833
01:28:04,233 --> 01:28:07,201
Ride out and meet him head on.

834
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:11,461
Draw him away from your women and children.

835
01:28:11,806 --> 01:28:13,433
You must fight.

836
01:28:13,608 --> 01:28:17,442
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

837
01:28:17,612 --> 01:28:19,239
Eomer is loyal to you.

838
01:28:19,413 --> 01:28:22,109
His men will return and fight for their king.

839
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:26,185
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

840
01:28:29,857 --> 01:28:32,087
Eomer cannot help us.

841
01:28:32,727 --> 01:28:34,490
I know what it is you want of me...

842
01:28:34,695 --> 01:28:37,960
but I will not bring further death to my people.

843
01:28:39,634 --> 01:28:41,329
I will not risk open war.

844
01:28:43,537 --> 01:28:46,904
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

845
01:28:51,178 --> 01:28:52,805
When last I looked...

846
01:28:53,247 --> 01:28:56,876
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

847
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:05,955
Then what is the king's decision?

848
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:12,895
By order of the king...

849
01:29:13,066 --> 01:29:14,533
the city must empty.

850
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:18,569
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

851
01:29:18,872 --> 01:29:22,774
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

852
01:29:22,976 --> 01:29:24,466
Helm's Deep.

853
01:29:24,644 --> 01:29:28,171
They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight.

854
01:29:28,348 --> 01:29:30,316
Who will defend them if not their king?

855
01:29:30,483 --> 01:29:32,951
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

856
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:34,916
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

857
01:29:35,088 --> 01:29:38,990
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

858
01:29:39,192 --> 01:29:41,353
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

859
01:29:41,561 --> 01:29:43,688
What they will get is a massacre.

860
01:29:45,265 --> 01:29:47,733
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

861
01:29:48,635 --> 01:29:51,968
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

862
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:55,306
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

863
01:29:55,775 --> 01:29:58,573
The people of Rohan will need you.

864
01:29:58,945 --> 01:30:01,413
The defenses have to hold.

865
01:30:02,849 --> 01:30:04,578
They will hold.

866
01:30:08,588 --> 01:30:10,886
The Grey Pilgrim.

867
01:30:11,057 --> 01:30:13,684
That's what they used to call me.

868
01:30:13,892 --> 01:30:18,955
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

869
01:30:20,599 --> 01:30:22,794
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

870
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,634
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

871
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:30,202
At dawn, look to the east.

872
01:30:30,376 --> 01:30:31,934
Go.

873
01:30:59,271 --> 01:31:02,604
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

874
01:31:41,646 --> 01:31:43,705
His name is Brego.

875
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:47,116
He was my cousin's horse.

876
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:49,148
Brego.

877
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:06,268
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

878
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:09,736
but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.

879
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,209
You speak as one of their own.

880
01:32:15,012 --> 01:32:17,446
I was raised in Rivendell...

881
01:32:17,715 --> 01:32:19,238
for a time.

882
01:32:22,552 --> 01:32:24,577
Turn this fellow free.

883
01:32:25,255 --> 01:32:27,723
He's seen enough of war.

884
01:32:39,503 --> 01:32:42,370
Gandalf the White.

885
01:32:42,539 --> 01:32:44,905
Gandalf the Fool!

886
01:32:46,176 --> 01:32:50,237
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

887
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:55,417
There were three who followed the wizard.

888
01:32:55,819 --> 01:33:01,189
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

889
01:33:01,558 --> 01:33:04,288
You stink of horse.

890
01:33:09,566 --> 01:33:11,431
The Man...

891
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:17,668
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

892
01:33:17,841 --> 01:33:21,640
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.

893
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,607
His cloth was poor.

894
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:29,644
And yet he bore a strange ring.

895
01:33:30,753 --> 01:33:34,280
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

896
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:40,326
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.

897
01:33:40,496 --> 01:33:42,396
The Ring of Barahir.

898
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:46,960
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

899
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,469
The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool.

900
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,369
The line was broken years ago.

901
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:56,267
It matters not.

902
01:33:56,445 --> 01:33:58,970
The world of Men shall fall.

903
01:33:59,148 --> 01:34:01,013
It will begin at Edoras.

904
01:34:10,192 --> 01:34:12,126
I am ready, Gamling.

905
01:34:12,294 --> 01:34:14,762
Bring my horse.

906
01:34:17,933 --> 01:34:19,298
This is not a defeat.

907
01:34:21,704 --> 01:34:22,932
We will return.

908
01:34:28,376 --> 01:34:30,776
We will return.

909
01:34:54,202 --> 01:34:56,136
You have some skill with a blade.

910
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:06,672
Women of this country learned long ago:

911
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:09,476
Those without swords can still die upon them.

912
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:11,482
I fear neither death nor pain.

913
01:35:12,754 --> 01:35:14,847
What do you fear, my lady?

914
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:20,090
A cage.

915
01:35:21,396 --> 01:35:25,230
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

916
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:29,301
And all chance of valor has
gone beyond recall or desire.

917
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:34,764
You're a daughter of kings...

918
01:35:36,043 --> 01:35:39,342
a shield maiden of Rohan.

919
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:47,142
I do not think that would be your fate.

920
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,212
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

921
01:36:23,423 --> 01:36:25,482
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

922
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:28,593
He will expect an attack on the city.

923
01:36:29,896 --> 01:36:33,160
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

924
01:36:33,332 --> 01:36:35,664
the great fortress of Rohan.

925
01:36:36,869 --> 01:36:41,272
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

926
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,437
They will be slow.

927
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,247
They will have women and children with them.

928
01:36:53,152 --> 01:36:55,382
Send out your Warg-riders.

929
01:37:10,236 --> 01:37:13,137
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

930
01:37:13,305 --> 01:37:15,967
- Why do you do that?
- What?

931
01:37:16,142 --> 01:37:18,667
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

932
01:37:19,111 --> 01:37:21,136
Because.

933
01:37:22,681 --> 01:37:24,808
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

934
01:37:25,017 --> 01:37:27,178
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

935
01:37:27,653 --> 01:37:30,417
It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.

936
01:37:30,589 --> 01:37:32,853
You have no idea what it did to him...

937
01:37:33,025 --> 01:37:35,492
what it's still doing to him.

938
01:37:37,729 --> 01:37:39,822
I want to help him, Sam.

939
01:37:39,998 --> 01:37:41,260
Why?

940
01:37:46,571 --> 01:37:49,699
Because I have to believe he can come back.

941
01:37:53,945 --> 01:37:55,879
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

942
01:37:56,047 --> 01:37:58,777
What do you know about it? Nothing!

943
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:09,888
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

944
01:38:10,728 --> 01:38:11,854
I do.

945
01:38:13,898 --> 01:38:15,763
It's the Ring.

946
01:38:16,334 --> 01:38:17,892
You can't take your eyes off it.

947
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:20,604
I've seen you.

948
01:38:21,072 --> 01:38:24,906
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

949
01:38:26,678 --> 01:38:28,908
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

950
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,776
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

951
01:38:31,983 --> 01:38:34,918
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

952
01:38:35,086 --> 01:38:36,781
Mine! My own!

953
01:38:37,654 --> 01:38:39,747
Can't you hear yourself?

954
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:41,618
Don't you know who you sound like?

955
01:38:51,902 --> 01:38:54,029
We wants it.

956
01:38:54,204 --> 01:38:56,900
We needs it.

957
01:38:57,074 --> 01:39:01,875
Must have the precious.

958
01:39:02,045 --> 01:39:05,412
They stole it from us.

959
01:39:05,616 --> 01:39:08,983
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

960
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:13,054
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

961
01:39:13,223 --> 01:39:16,488
No. Not master.

962
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:20,494
Yes, precious. False.

963
01:39:20,664 --> 01:39:25,158
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

964
01:39:26,303 --> 01:39:28,771
Master's my friend.

965
01:39:28,939 --> 01:39:34,002
You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.

966
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:37,770
Not listening. I'm not listening.

967
01:39:37,948 --> 01:39:41,940
You're a liar and a thief.

968
01:39:42,618 --> 01:39:44,142
No.

969
01:39:45,087 --> 01:39:47,988
Murderer.

970
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:51,483
Go away.

971
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:54,027
Go away?

972
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,830
I hate you.

973
01:39:59,001 --> 01:40:01,401
I hate you.

974
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:05,003
Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum.

975
01:40:05,174 --> 01:40:07,005
I saved us.

976
01:40:07,176 --> 01:40:11,704
It was me. We survived because of me.

977
01:40:12,949 --> 01:40:16,510
Not anymore.

978
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,411
What did you say?

979
01:40:21,524 --> 01:40:25,358
Master looks after us now.

980
01:40:25,528 --> 01:40:29,020
We don't need you.

981
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,290
What?

982
01:40:31,467 --> 01:40:33,230
Leave now...

983
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:37,202
and never come back.

984
01:40:37,373 --> 01:40:38,397
No.

985
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:43,106
Leave now and never come back.

986
01:40:45,747 --> 01:40:51,652
Leave now and never come back!

987
01:41:03,565 --> 01:41:06,261
We told him to go away.

988
01:41:06,434 --> 01:41:09,403
And away he goes, precious.

989
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:11,562
Gone! Gone! Gone!

990
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:13,571
Smeagol is free!

991
01:41:18,446 --> 01:41:19,936
Look.

992
01:41:20,148 --> 01:41:24,608
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

993
01:41:34,162 --> 01:41:35,595
They are young.

994
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:38,289
They are tender. They are nice.

995
01:41:38,466 --> 01:41:41,993
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

996
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:46,298
You'll make him sick, you will...

997
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:49,703
behaving like that.

998
01:41:52,146 --> 01:41:54,876
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

999
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,643
What's it doing?

1000
01:42:01,388 --> 01:42:03,982
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1001
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:06,353
It ruins it.

1002
01:42:06,527 --> 01:42:10,156
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

1003
01:42:14,301 --> 01:42:16,861
What we need is a few good taters.

1004
01:42:17,738 --> 01:42:20,798
What's taters, precious?

1005
01:42:20,974 --> 01:42:22,703
What's taters? Eh?

1006
01:42:22,876 --> 01:42:24,605
Po-ta-toes.

1007
01:42:24,945 --> 01:42:28,176
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

1008
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:35,178
Lovely, big, golden chips with
a nice piece of fried fish.

1009
01:42:36,523 --> 01:42:38,423
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1010
01:42:38,759 --> 01:42:40,954
Oh, yes, we could.

1011
01:42:41,128 --> 01:42:44,620
Spoil a nice fish.

1012
01:42:45,899 --> 01:42:48,527
Give it to us raw...

1013
01:42:48,702 --> 01:42:51,727
and wriggling.

1014
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:55,032
You keep nasty chips.

1015
01:42:55,975 --> 01:42:58,034
You're hopeless.

1016
01:43:10,523 --> 01:43:12,013
Mr. Frodo?

1017
01:43:29,909 --> 01:43:32,571
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1018
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:35,247
Servants of Sauron.

1019
01:43:36,048 --> 01:43:38,209
They are called to Mordor.

1020
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:41,409
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

1021
01:43:41,621 --> 01:43:44,784
It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.

1022
01:43:46,359 --> 01:43:50,022
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1023
01:43:50,196 --> 01:43:55,360
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.

1024
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:58,694
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1025
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:00,098
Mr. Frodo.

1026
01:44:00,605 --> 01:44:02,232
Look.

1027
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:08,109
It's an oliphaunt.

1028
01:44:16,321 --> 01:44:19,347
No one at home will believe this.

1029
01:44:30,502 --> 01:44:32,367
Smeagol?

1030
01:45:12,743 --> 01:45:15,211
We've lingered here too long.

1031
01:45:18,215 --> 01:45:19,546
Come on, Sam.

1032
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:35,726
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1033
01:45:37,434 --> 01:45:42,531
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1034
01:45:42,706 --> 01:45:45,607
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1035
01:45:47,011 --> 01:45:50,378
Those that claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder us.

1036
01:45:50,547 --> 01:45:52,572
The enemy?

1037
01:45:54,685 --> 01:45:58,177
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

1038
01:46:00,623 --> 01:46:02,682
You wonder what his name is...

1039
01:46:04,193 --> 01:46:06,457
where he came from.

1040
01:46:08,431 --> 01:46:10,865
And if he was really evil at heart.

1041
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:15,993
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1042
01:46:17,607 --> 01:46:20,098
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1043
01:46:22,312 --> 01:46:23,802
in peace.

1044
01:46:27,383 --> 01:46:30,409
War will make corpses of us all.

1045
01:46:30,586 --> 01:46:32,645
Bind their hands.

1046
01:46:41,084 --> 01:46:43,780
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

1047
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:47,650
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1048
01:46:47,824 --> 01:46:50,986
that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

1049
01:46:51,393 --> 01:46:53,293
It's the beards.

1050
01:46:53,495 --> 01:46:55,623
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

1051
01:46:55,798 --> 01:46:58,666
that there are no Dwarf women...

1052
01:46:58,834 --> 01:47:03,101
and that Dwarves just spring
out of holes in the ground...

1053
01:47:04,773 --> 01:47:06,638
which is, of course, ridiculous.

1054
01:47:12,781 --> 01:47:15,011
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1055
01:47:15,484 --> 01:47:17,509
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

1056
01:47:19,454 --> 01:47:23,254
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.

1057
01:47:23,524 --> 01:47:26,289
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.

1058
01:47:26,461 --> 01:47:28,760
Cut down by Orcs.

1059
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:31,923
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

1060
01:47:32,534 --> 01:47:37,163
Then she was left alone, to
tend her king in growing fear.

1061
01:47:37,338 --> 01:47:41,900
Doomed to wait upon an old man who
should have loved her as a father.

1062
01:47:51,919 --> 01:47:54,285
Gimli.

1063
01:47:54,455 --> 01:47:56,514
No, I couldn't

1064
01:47:56,691 --> 01:47:58,522
I really couldn't.

1065
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:04,657
I made some stew.

1066
01:48:04,831 --> 01:48:08,097
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1067
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:17,968
Thank you.

1068
01:48:38,464 --> 01:48:40,990
- It's good.
- Really?

1069
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:48,338
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1070
01:48:49,642 --> 01:48:53,703
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1071
01:48:54,146 --> 01:48:56,615
But he must be mistaken.

1072
01:48:56,882 --> 01:49:01,286
King Theoden has a good memory. He
was only a small child at the time.

1073
01:49:02,421 --> 01:49:05,619
Then you must be at least 60.

1074
01:49:07,727 --> 01:49:09,285
Seventy?

1075
01:49:09,729 --> 01:49:11,391
But you cannot be 80!

1076
01:49:14,734 --> 01:49:16,099
Eighty-seven.

1077
01:49:19,205 --> 01:49:21,298
You are one of the Dunedain.

1078
01:49:22,374 --> 01:49:25,468
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.

1079
01:49:26,712 --> 01:49:29,340
It was said that your race had passed into legend.

1080
01:49:30,015 --> 01:49:31,778
There are few of us left.

1081
01:49:31,952 --> 01:49:34,714
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

1082
01:49:35,488 --> 01:49:38,889
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1083
01:49:53,539 --> 01:49:57,668
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.

1084
01:49:58,476 --> 01:50:01,912
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1085
01:50:03,748 --> 01:50:06,148
Like my heart.

1086
01:50:07,585 --> 01:50:10,281
Go to sleep.

1087
01:50:10,455 --> 01:50:12,946
I am asleep.

1088
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:21,364
This is a dream.

1089
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,798
Then it is a good dream.

1090
01:50:38,783 --> 01:50:40,875
Sleep.

1091
01:51:43,846 --> 01:51:45,745
Arwen...

1092
01:52:35,196 --> 01:52:37,027
Where is she?

1093
01:52:38,199 --> 01:52:40,633
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1094
01:52:43,939 --> 01:52:46,702
Our time here is ending.

1095
01:52:47,409 --> 01:52:49,933
Arwen's time is ending.

1096
01:52:50,712 --> 01:52:51,973
Let her go.

1097
01:52:52,147 --> 01:52:54,137
Let her take the ship into the west.

1098
01:52:54,349 --> 01:52:57,409
Let her bear away her love
for you to the Undying Lands.

1099
01:52:57,585 --> 01:52:59,382
There it will be ever green.

1100
01:53:00,888 --> 01:53:03,254
But never more than memory.

1101
01:53:04,525 --> 01:53:07,551
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

1102
01:53:07,728 --> 01:53:11,357
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1103
01:53:11,532 --> 01:53:13,830
She belongs with her people.

1104
01:54:02,148 --> 01:54:03,979
Why are you saying this?

1105
01:54:05,551 --> 01:54:08,748
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1106
01:54:10,189 --> 01:54:12,851
It was a dream, Arwen.

1107
01:54:13,292 --> 01:54:14,656
Nothing more.

1108
01:54:16,029 --> 01:54:19,259
I don't believe you.

1109
01:54:28,274 --> 01:54:30,104
This belongs to you.

1110
01:54:32,878 --> 01:54:34,436
It was a gift.

1111
01:54:37,049 --> 01:54:38,573
Keep it.

1112
01:54:41,086 --> 01:54:42,281
My lord?

1113
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:49,652
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1114
01:55:13,151 --> 01:55:14,617
What is it?

1115
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:18,179
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1116
01:55:34,705 --> 01:55:36,729
Wargs!

1117
01:55:49,286 --> 01:55:50,981
A scout!

1118
01:55:57,293 --> 01:55:59,818
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1119
01:56:01,164 --> 01:56:03,359
Get them out of here!

1120
01:56:08,138 --> 01:56:10,129
All riders to the head of the column.

1121
01:56:10,874 --> 01:56:12,843
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1122
01:56:13,042 --> 01:56:14,771
Come on!

1123
01:56:26,589 --> 01:56:29,022
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1124
01:56:29,224 --> 01:56:30,692
- I can fight.
- No!

1125
01:56:33,396 --> 01:56:35,455
You must do this, for me.

1126
01:56:37,467 --> 01:56:39,059
Follow me!

1127
01:56:42,605 --> 01:56:46,904
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1128
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:49,772
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1129
01:58:01,982 --> 01:58:04,281
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1130
01:58:07,088 --> 01:58:08,645
That one counts as mine!

1131
01:58:25,372 --> 01:58:26,999
Stinking creature.

1132
01:59:54,193 --> 01:59:56,092
Aragorn!

1133
02:00:00,832 --> 02:00:02,299
Aragorn?

1134
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:19,214
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.

1135
02:00:19,384 --> 02:00:20,816
He's...

1136
02:00:21,386 --> 02:00:22,978
dead.

1137
02:00:23,621 --> 02:00:26,521
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1138
02:00:30,127 --> 02:00:31,424
You lie.

1139
02:01:05,328 --> 02:01:06,920
Get the wounded on horses.

1140
02:01:08,265 --> 02:01:11,392
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1141
02:01:11,834 --> 02:01:13,927
Leave the dead.

1142
02:01:21,377 --> 02:01:22,867
Come.

1143
02:01:33,056 --> 02:01:34,579
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1144
02:01:34,758 --> 02:01:37,658
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1145
02:01:40,228 --> 02:01:42,026
We're safe!

1146
02:01:43,566 --> 02:01:46,433
We're safe, my lady.

1147
02:01:46,601 --> 02:01:47,796
Thank you.

1148
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:33,579
- Mama!
- Eothain!

1149
02:02:33,747 --> 02:02:35,238
Freda!

1150
02:02:40,988 --> 02:02:43,822
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1151
02:02:47,695 --> 02:02:48,991
Take it to the caves.

1152
02:02:49,196 --> 02:02:52,029
Make way for the king.

1153
02:02:53,066 --> 02:02:56,866
Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.

1154
02:03:04,778 --> 02:03:08,509
So few. So few of you have returned.

1155
02:03:11,284 --> 02:03:13,549
Our people are safe.

1156
02:03:14,887 --> 02:03:17,448
We have paid for it with many lives.

1157
02:03:18,291 --> 02:03:19,816
My lady.

1158
02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:25,827
Lord Aragorn...

1159
02:03:25,999 --> 02:03:27,227
where is he?

1160
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:30,760
He fell.

1161
02:03:53,425 --> 02:03:56,395
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1162
02:03:56,562 --> 02:03:59,497
Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.

1163
02:03:59,732 --> 02:04:02,825
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1164
02:04:03,002 --> 02:04:05,596
Get them into the caves.

1165
02:04:06,472 --> 02:04:11,340
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1166
02:04:13,379 --> 02:04:16,780
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

1167
02:04:16,948 --> 02:04:19,281
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1168
02:04:19,451 --> 02:04:22,546
but for a small culvert at its base...

1169
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:25,485
which is little more than a drain.

1170
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:32,524
How? How can fire undo stone?

1171
02:04:32,698 --> 02:04:37,191
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

1172
02:04:40,804 --> 02:04:44,798
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

1173
02:04:44,975 --> 02:04:48,502
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

1174
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:51,240
thousands, to storm the Keep.

1175
02:04:51,416 --> 02:04:52,848
Tens of thousands.

1176
02:04:53,017 --> 02:04:57,078
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1177
02:05:09,033 --> 02:05:12,127
A new power is rising.

1178
02:05:12,302 --> 02:05:15,294
Its victory is at hand.

1179
02:05:20,979 --> 02:05:23,036
This night...

1180
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:27,813
the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

1181
02:05:27,985 --> 02:05:31,318
March to Helm's Deep!

1182
02:05:31,488 --> 02:05:34,924
Leave none alive!

1183
02:05:37,461 --> 02:05:39,928
To war!

1184
02:05:43,866 --> 02:05:48,327
There will be no dawn for Men.

1185
02:06:05,522 --> 02:06:07,579
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1186
02:06:07,790 --> 02:06:10,918
There is always smoke rising...

1187
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:14,994
from Isengard these days.

1188
02:06:15,231 --> 02:06:16,823
Isengard?

1189
02:06:17,033 --> 02:06:18,898
There was a time...

1190
02:06:19,235 --> 02:06:22,761
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1191
02:06:22,938 --> 02:06:26,306
But now he has a mind of metal...

1192
02:06:26,976 --> 02:06:29,409
and wheels.

1193
02:06:30,179 --> 02:06:34,673
He no longer cares for growing things.

1194
02:06:34,850 --> 02:06:36,647
What is it?

1195
02:06:41,656 --> 02:06:43,851
It's Saruman's army.

1196
02:06:44,059 --> 02:06:45,583
The war has started.

1197
02:07:23,964 --> 02:07:28,333
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

1198
02:08:00,601 --> 02:08:02,465
Brego.

1199
02:08:28,594 --> 02:08:29,789
Arwen.

1200
02:08:39,572 --> 02:08:41,368
I have made my choice.

1201
02:08:47,813 --> 02:08:50,680
He is not coming back.

1202
02:08:52,117 --> 02:08:55,450
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

1203
02:08:56,388 --> 02:08:59,358
There is still hope.

1204
02:09:03,528 --> 02:09:07,294
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

1205
02:09:10,702 --> 02:09:13,671
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

1206
02:09:13,839 --> 02:09:16,330
and all that you hope for comes true...

1207
02:09:16,508 --> 02:09:21,206
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1208
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:24,472
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

1209
02:09:24,649 --> 02:09:27,619
Aragorn will die.

1210
02:09:30,455 --> 02:09:32,980
And there will be no comfort for you...

1211
02:09:33,191 --> 02:09:37,354
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

1212
02:09:40,165 --> 02:09:42,895
He will come to death...

1213
02:09:43,067 --> 02:09:45,661
an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

1214
02:09:45,837 --> 02:09:50,500
in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

1215
02:09:59,617 --> 02:10:03,553
But you, my daughter...

1216
02:10:04,387 --> 02:10:09,415
you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

1217
02:10:09,593 --> 02:10:13,654
as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

1218
02:10:16,067 --> 02:10:18,466
Here you will dwell...

1219
02:10:18,636 --> 02:10:23,538
bound to your grief under the fading trees...

1220
02:10:25,276 --> 02:10:27,266
until all the world is changed...

1221
02:10:27,444 --> 02:10:31,939
and the long years of your life are utterly spent.

1222
02:10:40,457 --> 02:10:41,617
Arwen.

1223
02:10:48,264 --> 02:10:50,527
There is nothing for you here...

1224
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:53,293
only death.

1225
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:30,389
The power of the enemy is growing.

1226
02:12:30,565 --> 02:12:33,192
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

1227
02:12:33,366 --> 02:12:36,734
to destroy the people of Rohan.

1228
02:12:38,805 --> 02:12:42,434
Isengard has been unleashed.

1229
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:50,147
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

1230
02:12:51,284 --> 02:12:54,252
the last free kingdom of Men.

1231
02:12:54,454 --> 02:12:58,857
His war on this country will come swiftly.

1232
02:13:02,561 --> 02:13:05,655
He senses the Ring is close.

1233
02:13:05,832 --> 02:13:09,290
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

1234
02:13:09,469 --> 02:13:13,530
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

1235
02:13:15,075 --> 02:13:18,942
the quest will claim his life.

1236
02:13:19,111 --> 02:13:21,273
You know this.

1237
02:13:21,914 --> 02:13:24,747
You have foreseen it.

1238
02:13:26,853 --> 02:13:30,288
It is the risk we all took.

1239
02:13:34,627 --> 02:13:38,825
In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

1240
02:13:39,999 --> 02:13:44,436
It works hard now to find its
way back into the hands of Men.

1241
02:13:44,603 --> 02:13:50,063
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

1242
02:13:50,275 --> 02:13:53,837
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1243
02:13:54,045 --> 02:13:58,106
take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

1244
02:14:00,553 --> 02:14:02,383
It is close now.

1245
02:14:02,554 --> 02:14:06,820
So close to achieving its goal.

1246
02:14:09,928 --> 02:14:13,558
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

1247
02:14:13,732 --> 02:14:17,861
even unto to the ending of the world.

1248
02:14:19,703 --> 02:14:21,535
The time of the Elves...

1249
02:14:21,738 --> 02:14:23,673
is over.

1250
02:14:24,509 --> 02:14:28,104
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

1251
02:14:30,081 --> 02:14:33,345
Do we let them stand alone?

1252
02:14:37,888 --> 02:14:39,253
What news?

1253
02:14:39,424 --> 02:14:42,222
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

1254
02:14:42,393 --> 02:14:45,260
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

1255
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:49,457
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1256
02:14:49,633 --> 02:14:52,033
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1257
02:14:52,369 --> 02:14:54,496
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

1258
02:14:54,672 --> 02:14:58,073
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1259
02:14:59,177 --> 02:15:02,737
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1260
02:15:02,946 --> 02:15:05,972
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

1261
02:15:08,118 --> 02:15:10,313
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1262
02:15:10,487 --> 02:15:13,183
Sauron from Mordor.

1263
02:15:14,491 --> 02:15:17,722
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

1264
02:15:17,893 --> 02:15:19,588
Gondor is weak.

1265
02:15:19,763 --> 02:15:22,890
Sauron will strike us soon.

1266
02:15:23,634 --> 02:15:25,498
And he will strike hard.

1267
02:15:25,936 --> 02:15:30,032
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

1268
02:15:43,919 --> 02:15:46,149
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1269
02:15:46,322 --> 02:15:49,052
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1270
02:15:49,225 --> 02:15:51,489
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

1271
02:15:58,367 --> 02:16:00,096
Speak.

1272
02:16:01,202 --> 02:16:03,796
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1273
02:16:04,139 --> 02:16:07,166
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1274
02:16:07,610 --> 02:16:09,100
Your bodyguard?

1275
02:16:09,312 --> 02:16:11,075
His gardener.

1276
02:16:11,714 --> 02:16:13,682
And where is your skulking friend?

1277
02:16:15,217 --> 02:16:17,515
That gangrel creature.

1278
02:16:17,853 --> 02:16:19,820
He had an ill-favored look.

1279
02:16:21,556 --> 02:16:23,456
There was no other.

1280
02:16:27,562 --> 02:16:29,895
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

1281
02:16:33,234 --> 02:16:36,294
One we lost in Moria...

1282
02:16:37,372 --> 02:16:38,896
two were my kin...

1283
02:16:39,074 --> 02:16:42,805
a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men.

1284
02:16:43,011 --> 02:16:46,913
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

1285
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,683
You're a friend of Boromir?

1286
02:16:56,124 --> 02:16:57,614
Yes.

1287
02:16:58,693 --> 02:16:59,785
For my part.

1288
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:09,235
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

1289
02:17:11,271 --> 02:17:12,739
Dead?

1290
02:17:12,941 --> 02:17:14,965
How? When?

1291
02:17:15,242 --> 02:17:17,869
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.

1292
02:17:18,211 --> 02:17:22,046
If something has happened to
Boromir, we would have you tell us.

1293
02:17:24,786 --> 02:17:31,247
His horn washed up upon the
riverbank, about six days past.

1294
02:17:31,458 --> 02:17:34,552
It was cloven in two.

1295
02:17:36,162 --> 02:17:39,563
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1296
02:17:41,602 --> 02:17:43,399
He was my brother.

1297
02:18:32,850 --> 02:18:35,320
Boromir!

1298
02:18:35,854 --> 02:18:37,720
Boromir!

1299
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:45,726
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

1300
02:18:45,897 --> 02:18:49,560
A place of light and beauty and music.

1301
02:18:49,734 --> 02:18:52,066
And so it shall be once more!

1302
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:57,268
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1303
02:18:57,477 --> 02:19:01,844
Never again will the land of
my people fall into enemy hands.

1304
02:19:05,650 --> 02:19:11,316
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1305
02:19:11,690 --> 02:19:13,657
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1306
02:19:13,824 --> 02:19:16,657
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1307
02:19:25,369 --> 02:19:28,134
Good speech. Nice and short.

1308
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:31,240
Leaves more time for drinking!

1309
02:19:31,542 --> 02:19:35,740
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1310
02:19:39,184 --> 02:19:41,345
Remember today, little brother.

1311
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:44,511
Today, life is good.

1312
02:19:48,692 --> 02:19:50,284
What?

1313
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:52,128
He's here.

1314
02:19:55,332 --> 02:19:57,164
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?

1315
02:19:57,334 --> 02:19:58,357
Where is he?

1316
02:19:58,535 --> 02:20:01,993
Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?

1317
02:20:02,572 --> 02:20:04,267
Father!

1318
02:20:09,146 --> 02:20:11,512
They say you vanquished the
enemy almost single-handedly.

1319
02:20:11,682 --> 02:20:15,082
They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1320
02:20:16,553 --> 02:20:19,454
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

1321
02:20:20,256 --> 02:20:22,554
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1322
02:20:22,726 --> 02:20:24,751
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

1323
02:20:24,928 --> 02:20:26,623
Oh, too few.

1324
02:20:27,131 --> 02:20:29,530
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

1325
02:20:31,733 --> 02:20:34,726
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1326
02:20:34,938 --> 02:20:37,167
That is not my intent.

1327
02:20:37,373 --> 02:20:41,139
You give him no credit, and
yet he tries to do your will.

1328
02:20:44,513 --> 02:20:47,414
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1329
02:20:47,584 --> 02:20:50,347
I know his uses, and they are few.

1330
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:54,114
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1331
02:20:55,291 --> 02:20:57,724
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1332
02:20:57,893 --> 02:21:00,760
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

1333
02:21:00,929 --> 02:21:04,729
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1334
02:21:06,969 --> 02:21:09,233
The One Ring.

1335
02:21:12,008 --> 02:21:16,671
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1336
02:21:16,844 --> 02:21:20,474
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1337
02:21:20,649 --> 02:21:24,779
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1338
02:21:26,589 --> 02:21:29,249
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1339
02:21:29,424 --> 02:21:33,120
Ever the Ring will seek to
corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.

1340
02:21:33,294 --> 02:21:37,197
But you, you are strong. And our need is great.

1341
02:21:37,366 --> 02:21:42,667
It is our blood which is being
spilled, our people who are dying.

1342
02:21:42,870 --> 02:21:47,898
Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies.

1343
02:21:48,109 --> 02:21:49,576
He will return.

1344
02:21:49,777 --> 02:21:53,509
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

1345
02:21:53,681 --> 02:21:56,242
You must go.

1346
02:21:57,417 --> 02:21:59,511
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1347
02:22:00,353 --> 02:22:05,849
No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.

1348
02:22:06,027 --> 02:22:09,724
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1349
02:22:09,897 --> 02:22:12,865
- send me in his stead.
- You?

1350
02:22:14,068 --> 02:22:16,002
Oh, I see.

1351
02:22:16,169 --> 02:22:20,367
A chance for Faramir, captain
of Gondor, to show his quality.

1352
02:22:20,807 --> 02:22:22,776
I think not.

1353
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:25,844
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1354
02:22:26,013 --> 02:22:28,913
The one who will not fail me.

1355
02:22:45,999 --> 02:22:49,162
Remember today, little brother.

1356
02:23:07,554 --> 02:23:09,544
Captain Faramir!

1357
02:23:10,824 --> 02:23:12,950
We found the third one.

1358
02:23:24,470 --> 02:23:26,438
You must come with me. Now.

1359
02:23:37,649 --> 02:23:38,741
Down there.

1360
02:23:53,665 --> 02:23:56,565
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.

1361
02:24:07,178 --> 02:24:08,668
They wait for my command.

1362
02:24:14,152 --> 02:24:15,244
Shall I shoot?

1363
02:24:16,487 --> 02:24:19,513
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

1364
02:24:19,690 --> 02:24:21,521
So juicy sweet

1365
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:25,129
Our only wish To catch a fish

1366
02:24:25,297 --> 02:24:27,991
So juicy sweet

1367
02:24:34,972 --> 02:24:36,370
Wait.

1368
02:24:37,875 --> 02:24:40,707
This creature is bound to me.

1369
02:24:41,311 --> 02:24:43,245
And I to him.

1370
02:24:46,516 --> 02:24:47,814
He is our guide.

1371
02:24:52,557 --> 02:24:53,956
Please...

1372
02:24:54,125 --> 02:24:55,989
let me go down to him.

1373
02:25:07,304 --> 02:25:08,965
Smeagol.

1374
02:25:09,973 --> 02:25:12,202
Master is here.

1375
02:25:13,409 --> 02:25:14,535
Come, Smeagol.

1376
02:25:17,414 --> 02:25:20,042
Trust master. Come.

1377
02:25:23,220 --> 02:25:27,053
We must go now?

1378
02:25:27,423 --> 02:25:30,860
Smeagol, you must trust master.

1379
02:25:31,026 --> 02:25:32,425
Follow me. Come on.

1380
02:25:33,662 --> 02:25:35,152
Come.

1381
02:25:37,701 --> 02:25:38,860
Come, Smeagol.

1382
02:25:39,402 --> 02:25:41,426
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

1383
02:25:41,971 --> 02:25:43,461
Come on.

1384
02:25:47,910 --> 02:25:49,571
Don't hurt him!

1385
02:25:49,746 --> 02:25:52,475
Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.

1386
02:25:52,648 --> 02:25:53,946
Master!

1387
02:26:38,367 --> 02:26:43,134
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

1388
02:26:44,406 --> 02:26:47,000
Cruel Men hurts us.

1389
02:26:47,209 --> 02:26:50,178
Master tricksed us.

1390
02:26:50,379 --> 02:26:53,940
Of course he did.

1391
02:26:54,316 --> 02:26:58,013
I told you he was tricksy.

1392
02:26:58,186 --> 02:27:01,212
I told you he was false.

1393
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:04,086
Master is our friend.

1394
02:27:04,259 --> 02:27:06,625
Our friend.

1395
02:27:06,795 --> 02:27:08,956
Master betrayed us.

1396
02:27:09,131 --> 02:27:12,123
No. Not its business.

1397
02:27:13,201 --> 02:27:15,669
Leave us alone!

1398
02:27:15,837 --> 02:27:18,237
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1399
02:27:18,407 --> 02:27:20,705
They stole it from us!

1400
02:27:20,876 --> 02:27:22,309
No. No.

1401
02:27:22,878 --> 02:27:24,505
What did they steal?

1402
02:27:26,648 --> 02:27:31,984
My precious!

1403
02:27:35,624 --> 02:27:37,251
We have to get out of here.

1404
02:27:37,859 --> 02:27:39,827
You go. Go, now.

1405
02:27:42,431 --> 02:27:44,296
You can do it.

1406
02:27:45,734 --> 02:27:47,201
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1407
02:27:47,402 --> 02:27:49,165
Just this once.

1408
02:27:49,371 --> 02:27:51,100
Put it on.

1409
02:27:51,573 --> 02:27:53,564
Disappear.

1410
02:27:54,643 --> 02:27:55,701
I can't.

1411
02:27:58,814 --> 02:28:01,044
You were right, Sam.

1412
02:28:02,484 --> 02:28:04,975
You tried to tell me but...

1413
02:28:09,691 --> 02:28:11,852
I'm sorry.

1414
02:28:16,398 --> 02:28:19,265
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1415
02:28:20,702 --> 02:28:22,329
If I put it on...

1416
02:28:22,537 --> 02:28:24,869
he'll find me.

1417
02:28:26,541 --> 02:28:28,509
He'll see.

1418
02:28:29,744 --> 02:28:31,712
Mr. Frodo...

1419
02:28:36,585 --> 02:28:40,851
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

1420
02:28:43,058 --> 02:28:46,050
Here in the Wild I have you...

1421
02:28:46,228 --> 02:28:48,128
two Halflings...

1422
02:28:48,296 --> 02:28:51,459
and a host of men at my call.

1423
02:28:54,803 --> 02:28:58,261
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1424
02:29:07,983 --> 02:29:11,714
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

1425
02:29:13,321 --> 02:29:16,347
to show his quality.

1426
02:29:37,445 --> 02:29:39,037
No!

1427
02:29:42,217 --> 02:29:43,548
Stop it!

1428
02:29:43,718 --> 02:29:44,776
Leave him alone.

1429
02:29:46,121 --> 02:29:48,612
Don't you understand?

1430
02:29:49,925 --> 02:29:51,825
He's got to destroy it!

1431
02:29:51,993 --> 02:29:55,224
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1432
02:29:55,397 --> 02:29:57,058
To the Mountain of Fire!

1433
02:29:58,133 --> 02:30:01,227
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1434
02:30:01,436 --> 02:30:04,405
Please. It's such a burden.

1435
02:30:06,608 --> 02:30:08,667
Will you not help him?

1436
02:30:10,045 --> 02:30:11,945
Captain?

1437
02:30:12,614 --> 02:30:14,844
Prepare to leave.

1438
02:30:19,788 --> 02:30:22,222
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1439
02:31:35,163 --> 02:31:37,791
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1440
02:31:37,966 --> 02:31:41,026
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

1441
02:31:41,236 --> 02:31:44,967
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1442
02:31:45,173 --> 02:31:49,166
and the most reckless man I ever knew.

1443
02:31:49,878 --> 02:31:51,345
Bless you, laddie.

1444
02:31:51,946 --> 02:31:53,675
Gimli, where is the king?

1445
02:32:07,462 --> 02:32:08,793
You look terrible.

1446
02:32:50,538 --> 02:32:52,563
A great host, you say?

1447
02:32:52,774 --> 02:32:55,436
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1448
02:32:56,111 --> 02:32:59,103
Ten thousand strong at least.

1449
02:33:00,648 --> 02:33:02,081
Ten thousand?

1450
02:33:02,517 --> 02:33:05,008
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1451
02:33:07,689 --> 02:33:09,816
To destroy the world of Men.

1452
02:33:12,327 --> 02:33:14,318
They will be here by nightfall.

1453
02:33:20,168 --> 02:33:21,465
Let them come!

1454
02:33:23,004 --> 02:33:25,734
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

1455
02:33:25,940 --> 02:33:29,068
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1456
02:33:37,252 --> 02:33:40,187
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

1457
02:33:40,355 --> 02:33:42,789
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...

1458
02:33:42,957 --> 02:33:45,687
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1459
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:48,260
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1460
02:33:48,863 --> 02:33:51,058
These are Uruk-hai.

1461
02:33:51,232 --> 02:33:54,668
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.

1462
02:33:56,337 --> 02:33:59,966
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1463
02:34:00,175 --> 02:34:03,770
I know how to defend my own keep.

1464
02:34:10,385 --> 02:34:13,786
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

1465
02:34:13,955 --> 02:34:19,188
Saruman's hordes will pillage
and burn. We've seen it before.

1466
02:34:19,394 --> 02:34:22,056
Crops can be resown...

1467
02:34:22,230 --> 02:34:25,222
homes rebuilt.

1468
02:34:25,834 --> 02:34:28,394
Within these walls...

1469
02:34:28,803 --> 02:34:30,270
we will outlast them.

1470
02:34:30,472 --> 02:34:32,872
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

1471
02:34:33,041 --> 02:34:34,565
They come to destroy its people...

1472
02:34:34,709 --> 02:34:37,177
down to the last child.

1473
02:34:38,079 --> 02:34:40,343
What would you have me do?

1474
02:34:40,515 --> 02:34:42,244
Look at my men.

1475
02:34:42,417 --> 02:34:44,146
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1476
02:34:46,354 --> 02:34:50,757
If this is to be our end, then I
would have them make such an end...

1477
02:34:50,925 --> 02:34:53,951
as to be worthy of remembrance.

1478
02:34:57,599 --> 02:34:59,499
Send out riders, my lord.

1479
02:34:59,801 --> 02:35:02,668
You must call for aid.

1480
02:35:05,974 --> 02:35:08,238
And who will come?

1481
02:35:08,643 --> 02:35:10,235
Elves?

1482
02:35:10,411 --> 02:35:12,470
Dwarves?

1483
02:35:13,248 --> 02:35:16,115
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

1484
02:35:16,951 --> 02:35:19,215
The old alliances are dead.

1485
02:35:19,654 --> 02:35:22,452
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1486
02:35:22,624 --> 02:35:24,819
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

1487
02:35:25,793 --> 02:35:29,024
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

1488
02:35:29,197 --> 02:35:31,131
Where was Gon...?

1489
02:35:33,801 --> 02:35:35,701
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1490
02:35:37,305 --> 02:35:39,773
we are alone.

1491
02:35:46,648 --> 02:35:48,377
Get the women and children into the caves.

1492
02:35:48,550 --> 02:35:49,812
We need more time to lay provisions...

1493
02:35:49,984 --> 02:35:53,476
There is no time. War is upon us.

1494
02:35:53,755 --> 02:35:55,450
Secure the gate.

1495
02:36:00,662 --> 02:36:02,755
We Ents have not troubled...

1496
02:36:02,964 --> 02:36:06,331
about the wars of Men and wizards...

1497
02:36:07,101 --> 02:36:10,093
for a very long time.

1498
02:36:11,372 --> 02:36:16,139
But now, something is about to happen...

1499
02:36:16,311 --> 02:36:18,643
that has not happened...

1500
02:36:18,846 --> 02:36:21,314
for an age.

1501
02:36:22,517 --> 02:36:24,781
Entmoot.

1502
02:36:25,219 --> 02:36:26,208
What's that?

1503
02:36:26,621 --> 02:36:29,454
'Tis a gathering.

1504
02:36:30,658 --> 02:36:33,218
A gathering of what?

1505
02:36:51,179 --> 02:36:53,545
Beech. Oak.

1506
02:36:53,715 --> 02:36:55,615
Chestnut. Ash.

1507
02:36:55,883 --> 02:36:57,851
Good. Good. Good.

1508
02:36:58,019 --> 02:37:00,385
Many have come.

1509
02:37:07,929 --> 02:37:10,693
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1510
02:37:10,865 --> 02:37:13,425
will go to war.

1511
02:37:22,410 --> 02:37:25,470
Move back! Move to the caves!

1512
02:37:27,949 --> 02:37:30,008
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1513
02:37:30,418 --> 02:37:32,716
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1514
02:37:32,887 --> 02:37:35,117
They can support the archers from above the gate.

1515
02:37:35,289 --> 02:37:38,417
Aragorn, you must rest.

1516
02:37:38,593 --> 02:37:40,993
You're no use to us half alive.

1517
02:37:41,462 --> 02:37:42,656
Aragorn!

1518
02:37:46,067 --> 02:37:49,093
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

1519
02:37:49,303 --> 02:37:50,930
That is an honorable charge.

1520
02:37:51,139 --> 02:37:54,006
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1521
02:37:54,175 --> 02:37:55,870
What renown is there in that?

1522
02:37:56,044 --> 02:37:59,741
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

1523
02:38:00,014 --> 02:38:02,812
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

1524
02:38:02,984 --> 02:38:07,978
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1525
02:38:08,289 --> 02:38:11,087
You do not command the others to stay!

1526
02:38:11,259 --> 02:38:15,025
They fight beside you because
they would not be parted from you.

1527
02:38:16,197 --> 02:38:18,392
Because they love you.

1528
02:38:25,540 --> 02:38:27,030
I'm sorry.

1529
02:39:32,974 --> 02:39:36,205
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1530
02:39:37,278 --> 02:39:39,075
These are no soldiers.

1531
02:39:41,349 --> 02:39:44,807
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1532
02:39:48,756 --> 02:39:51,657
Look at them. They're frightened.

1533
02:39:51,826 --> 02:39:53,293
I can see it in their eyes.

1534
02:40:14,282 --> 02:40:16,477
Then I shall die as one of them!

1535
02:40:22,924 --> 02:40:24,755
Let him go, lad.

1536
02:40:25,326 --> 02:40:27,294
Let him be.

1537
02:40:28,763 --> 02:40:34,224
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.

1538
02:40:38,472 --> 02:40:40,372
My lord?

1539
02:40:42,443 --> 02:40:45,003
Who am I, Gamling?

1540
02:40:48,382 --> 02:40:52,284
You are our king, sire.

1541
02:40:55,289 --> 02:40:58,554
And do you trust your king?

1542
02:41:00,094 --> 02:41:03,257
Your men, my lord...

1543
02:41:03,431 --> 02:41:06,229
will follow you to whatever end.

1544
02:41:13,140 --> 02:41:15,040
To whatever end.

1545
02:41:24,886 --> 02:41:28,447
Where is the horse and the rider?

1546
02:41:28,623 --> 02:41:31,683
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1547
02:41:33,194 --> 02:41:37,563
They have passed like rain on the mountains.

1548
02:41:38,566 --> 02:41:41,797
Like wind in the meadow.

1549
02:41:45,506 --> 02:41:49,272
The days have gone down in the West...

1550
02:41:49,977 --> 02:41:52,605
behind the hills...

1551
02:41:54,515 --> 02:41:56,142
into Shadow.

1552
02:42:04,592 --> 02:42:08,028
How did it come to this?

1553
02:42:29,350 --> 02:42:31,215
It's been going for hours.

1554
02:42:32,353 --> 02:42:34,719
They must have decided something by now.

1555
02:42:34,889 --> 02:42:38,985
Decided? No.

1556
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:44,291
We only just finished saying...

1557
02:42:45,499 --> 02:42:47,364
good morning.

1558
02:42:48,736 --> 02:42:51,899
But it's nighttime already.

1559
02:42:52,106 --> 02:42:53,903
You can't take forever.

1560
02:42:54,909 --> 02:42:56,934
Don't be hasty.

1561
02:42:57,411 --> 02:42:59,811
We're running out of time!

1562
02:43:02,817 --> 02:43:05,786
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1563
02:43:23,371 --> 02:43:24,668
Give me your sword.

1564
02:43:34,181 --> 02:43:35,307
What is your name?

1565
02:43:35,850 --> 02:43:38,216
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1566
02:43:40,354 --> 02:43:42,982
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

1567
02:43:44,959 --> 02:43:46,927
They say that it is hopeless.

1568
02:44:04,779 --> 02:44:06,406
This is a good sword.

1569
02:44:08,449 --> 02:44:10,781
Haleth, son of Hama...

1570
02:44:15,122 --> 02:44:17,283
there is always hope.

1571
02:44:40,214 --> 02:44:43,581
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1572
02:44:43,751 --> 02:44:45,309
Forgive me.

1573
02:44:45,486 --> 02:44:46,919
I was wrong to despair.

1574
02:44:56,130 --> 02:44:58,928
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1575
02:45:02,403 --> 02:45:04,428
It's a little tight across the chest.

1576
02:45:10,644 --> 02:45:12,612
That is no Orc horn.

1577
02:45:18,285 --> 02:45:20,116
Send for the king.

1578
02:45:20,287 --> 02:45:23,882
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1579
02:45:55,523 --> 02:45:57,184
How is this possible?

1580
02:45:58,192 --> 02:46:01,821
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1581
02:46:01,996 --> 02:46:05,227
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

1582
02:46:05,933 --> 02:46:10,165
Long ago we fought and died together.

1583
02:46:12,473 --> 02:46:15,374
We come to honor that allegiance.

1584
02:46:23,851 --> 02:46:25,785
You are most welcome.

1585
02:46:31,158 --> 02:46:35,094
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

1586
02:47:08,762 --> 02:47:12,027
You could have picked a better spot.

1587
02:47:16,937 --> 02:47:21,101
Well, lad, whatever luck you live
by, let's hope it lasts the night.

1588
02:47:27,281 --> 02:47:29,078
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1589
02:47:29,717 --> 02:47:32,208
Let's hope they last the night.

1590
02:49:13,620 --> 02:49:16,418
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1591
02:49:17,691 --> 02:49:19,488
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1592
02:50:22,689 --> 02:50:24,486
So it begins.

1593
02:50:51,318 --> 02:50:52,683
Did they hit anything?

1594
02:50:53,353 --> 02:50:55,344
Give them a volley.

1595
02:50:55,522 --> 02:50:57,615
- Fire!
- Fire!

1596
02:51:13,373 --> 02:51:15,068
Send them to me! Come on!

1597
02:51:35,762 --> 02:51:36,854
Good!

1598
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:46,639
Swords! Swords!

1599
02:52:24,778 --> 02:52:26,905
Legolas! Two already!

1600
02:52:27,080 --> 02:52:29,207
I'm on 17!

1601
02:52:29,383 --> 02:52:31,943
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1602
02:52:38,692 --> 02:52:40,421
Nineteen!

1603
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:07,853
Merry.

1604
02:53:12,259 --> 02:53:16,059
We have just agreed.

1605
02:53:26,106 --> 02:53:27,573
Yes?

1606
02:53:29,076 --> 02:53:33,240
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1607
02:53:34,381 --> 02:53:37,544
and we have agreed...

1608
02:53:38,018 --> 02:53:42,045
you are not Orcs.

1609
02:53:43,790 --> 02:53:45,917
Well, that's good news.

1610
02:53:46,093 --> 02:53:50,223
And what about Saruman? Have
you come to a decision about him?

1611
02:53:50,864 --> 02:53:54,664
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1612
02:53:54,835 --> 02:53:56,359
Hasty?

1613
02:53:57,170 --> 02:53:59,070
Our friends are out there.

1614
02:53:59,239 --> 02:54:03,403
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1615
02:54:03,744 --> 02:54:06,008
War? Yes.

1616
02:54:06,179 --> 02:54:08,079
It affects us all.

1617
02:54:08,248 --> 02:54:11,240
Tree, root and twig.

1618
02:54:12,119 --> 02:54:16,146
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1619
02:54:16,356 --> 02:54:18,290
it takes a long time...

1620
02:54:18,458 --> 02:54:23,361
to say anything in Old Entish...

1621
02:54:23,530 --> 02:54:27,762
and we never say anything...

1622
02:54:27,934 --> 02:54:31,870
unless it is worth taking...

1623
02:54:32,039 --> 02:54:35,998
a long time to say.

1624
02:54:36,810 --> 02:54:40,109
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1625
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:41,338
Nineteen!

1626
02:54:41,915 --> 02:54:43,780
Twenty!

1627
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:45,611
Twenty-one!

1628
02:54:55,696 --> 02:54:57,687
Causeway!

1629
02:55:05,505 --> 02:55:07,871
Is this it?

1630
02:55:08,041 --> 02:55:10,976
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1631
02:56:36,963 --> 02:56:38,328
Brace the gate!

1632
02:56:56,683 --> 02:56:58,947
Hold them! Stand firm!

1633
02:57:06,827 --> 02:57:08,158
Aragorn!

1634
02:57:12,799 --> 02:57:13,993
Gimli!

1635
02:58:02,749 --> 02:58:06,685
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1636
02:58:07,454 --> 02:58:11,481
We must weather such things as we have always done.

1637
02:58:12,292 --> 02:58:14,385
How can that be your decision?!

1638
02:58:15,061 --> 02:58:18,690
This is not our war.

1639
02:58:18,999 --> 02:58:21,194
But you're part of this world!

1640
02:58:25,372 --> 02:58:27,203
Aren't you?!

1641
02:58:31,278 --> 02:58:33,644
You must help. Please.

1642
02:58:34,881 --> 02:58:37,645
You must do something.

1643
02:58:37,918 --> 02:58:42,218
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1644
02:58:43,423 --> 02:58:47,154
But your part in this tale is over.

1645
02:58:47,327 --> 02:58:49,557
Go back to your home.

1646
02:58:59,606 --> 02:59:01,870
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1647
02:59:02,042 --> 02:59:03,907
We don't belong here, Merry.

1648
02:59:04,077 --> 02:59:06,341
It's too big for us.

1649
02:59:06,513 --> 02:59:09,175
What can we do in the end?

1650
02:59:11,484 --> 02:59:14,112
We've got the Shire.

1651
02:59:14,654 --> 02:59:17,179
Maybe we should go home.

1652
02:59:19,025 --> 02:59:22,256
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1653
02:59:22,429 --> 02:59:27,332
and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

1654
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:29,092
And...

1655
02:59:30,937 --> 02:59:33,963
And all that was once green and
good in this world will be gone.

1656
02:59:37,477 --> 02:59:40,412
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1657
02:59:59,933 --> 03:00:01,161
Aragorn!

1658
03:00:01,334 --> 03:00:03,700
Fall back to the Keep!

1659
03:00:03,903 --> 03:00:06,963
Get your men out of there!

1660
03:00:16,649 --> 03:00:18,310
Haldir!

1661
03:00:22,422 --> 03:00:25,687
What are you doing? What are you stopping for?

1662
03:00:44,878 --> 03:00:46,106
Haldir!

1663
03:01:28,822 --> 03:01:30,312
Brace the gate!

1664
03:01:32,559 --> 03:01:33,856
Hold them!

1665
03:01:35,628 --> 03:01:38,995
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1666
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:09,094
Make way!

1667
03:02:11,998 --> 03:02:13,727
We cannot hold much longer!

1668
03:02:19,739 --> 03:02:23,266
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1669
03:02:23,476 --> 03:02:26,036
As long as you can give me.

1670
03:02:26,212 --> 03:02:27,873
Gimli!

1671
03:02:29,349 --> 03:02:30,714
Timbers!

1672
03:02:30,884 --> 03:02:32,852
Brace the gate!

1673
03:02:47,567 --> 03:02:49,262
Come on. We can take them.

1674
03:02:50,136 --> 03:02:51,728
It's a long way.

1675
03:02:57,010 --> 03:02:58,773
Toss me.

1676
03:02:59,946 --> 03:03:01,777
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1677
03:03:01,948 --> 03:03:03,506
You'll have to toss me!

1678
03:03:09,122 --> 03:03:10,384
Don't tell the Elf.

1679
03:03:10,924 --> 03:03:12,687
Not a word.

1680
03:03:27,974 --> 03:03:29,407
Shore up the door!

1681
03:03:29,576 --> 03:03:31,669
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1682
03:03:31,844 --> 03:03:32,902
Watch our backs!

1683
03:03:36,983 --> 03:03:39,213
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1684
03:04:29,202 --> 03:04:30,601
Hold fast the gate!

1685
03:04:34,807 --> 03:04:37,742
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

1686
03:04:42,482 --> 03:04:44,074
Aragorn!

1687
03:05:17,550 --> 03:05:19,984
Pull everybody back.

1688
03:05:20,353 --> 03:05:22,150
Pull them back.

1689
03:05:22,689 --> 03:05:24,156
Fall back!

1690
03:05:24,324 --> 03:05:26,815
Fall back!

1691
03:05:27,994 --> 03:05:29,689
They have broken through!

1692
03:05:29,862 --> 03:05:32,126
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1693
03:05:32,298 --> 03:05:34,528
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1694
03:05:34,634 --> 03:05:37,228
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1695
03:05:37,437 --> 03:05:39,667
Into the Keep!

1696
03:05:51,150 --> 03:05:56,110
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

1697
03:05:56,289 --> 03:06:00,988
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1698
03:06:06,733 --> 03:06:07,995
Wait! Stop!

1699
03:06:08,901 --> 03:06:10,391
Stop!

1700
03:06:13,539 --> 03:06:15,234
Turn around.

1701
03:06:16,175 --> 03:06:18,871
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1702
03:06:19,045 --> 03:06:24,039
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1703
03:06:24,384 --> 03:06:27,080
Yes. Exactly.

1704
03:06:27,253 --> 03:06:30,484
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

1705
03:06:30,656 --> 03:06:33,318
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1706
03:06:33,493 --> 03:06:35,484
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1707
03:06:38,097 --> 03:06:41,123
That doesn't make sense to me.

1708
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:42,460
But then...

1709
03:06:42,668 --> 03:06:45,330
you are very small.

1710
03:06:45,838 --> 03:06:47,567
Perhaps you're right.

1711
03:06:50,243 --> 03:06:51,733
South it is, then.

1712
03:06:53,279 --> 03:06:56,612
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1713
03:06:58,651 --> 03:07:01,415
I always like going south.

1714
03:07:01,587 --> 03:07:05,887
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1715
03:07:06,492 --> 03:07:08,960
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1716
03:07:09,128 --> 03:07:11,062
No, we won't.

1717
03:07:11,798 --> 03:07:14,062
Not this time.

1718
03:07:20,740 --> 03:07:21,729
Look!

1719
03:07:23,409 --> 03:07:25,843
Osgiliath burns!

1720
03:07:26,012 --> 03:07:27,445
Mordor has come.

1721
03:07:28,581 --> 03:07:30,981
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1722
03:07:32,318 --> 03:07:34,513
It has only the power to destroy.

1723
03:07:35,354 --> 03:07:36,787
Please...

1724
03:07:36,956 --> 03:07:38,583
let me go.

1725
03:07:39,625 --> 03:07:41,217
Hurry.

1726
03:07:44,697 --> 03:07:46,096
Faramir!

1727
03:07:46,265 --> 03:07:48,756
You must let me go!

1728
03:07:49,202 --> 03:07:52,660
And those little family of field mice...

1729
03:07:52,839 --> 03:07:55,672
that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

1730
03:07:56,409 --> 03:07:59,708
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

1731
03:08:10,890 --> 03:08:13,825
Many of these trees were my friends.

1732
03:08:14,527 --> 03:08:19,157
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

1733
03:08:20,333 --> 03:08:21,527
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1734
03:08:21,701 --> 03:08:24,465
They had voices of their own.

1735
03:08:26,739 --> 03:08:29,264
Saruman.

1736
03:08:29,642 --> 03:08:32,702
A wizard should know better!

1737
03:08:46,926 --> 03:08:50,555
There is no curse in Elvish...

1738
03:08:50,763 --> 03:08:53,425
Entish or the tongues of Men...

1739
03:08:53,599 --> 03:08:55,931
for this treachery.

1740
03:08:57,370 --> 03:09:00,203
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1741
03:09:04,911 --> 03:09:06,105
Where are they going?

1742
03:09:06,646 --> 03:09:09,877
They have business with the Orcs.

1743
03:09:10,349 --> 03:09:14,615
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1744
03:09:14,787 --> 03:09:17,415
with rock and stone.

1745
03:09:41,314 --> 03:09:42,440
Yes.

1746
03:09:43,549 --> 03:09:44,982
Come, my friends.

1747
03:09:46,319 --> 03:09:50,517
The Ents are going to war.

1748
03:09:50,690 --> 03:09:52,453
It is likely...

1749
03:09:52,625 --> 03:09:56,152
that we go to our doom.

1750
03:09:57,563 --> 03:10:00,031
Last march...

1751
03:10:00,566 --> 03:10:02,591
of the Ents.

1752
03:10:50,716 --> 03:10:54,447
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1753
03:10:54,620 --> 03:10:56,679
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1754
03:10:59,458 --> 03:11:00,925
Mr. Frodo?

1755
03:11:01,227 --> 03:11:05,323
It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.

1756
03:11:05,498 --> 03:11:07,989
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

1757
03:11:22,348 --> 03:11:23,747
Take them to my father.

1758
03:11:25,317 --> 03:11:28,309
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1759
03:11:30,723 --> 03:11:33,749
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

1760
03:11:34,860 --> 03:11:37,556
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

1761
03:11:38,197 --> 03:11:40,961
You want to know why your brother died?

1762
03:11:41,467 --> 03:11:45,198
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1763
03:11:45,404 --> 03:11:47,304
He tried to kill him!

1764
03:11:47,473 --> 03:11:49,805
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1765
03:11:50,576 --> 03:11:52,441
Watch out!

1766
03:12:03,355 --> 03:12:04,481
Mr. Frodo?

1767
03:12:07,126 --> 03:12:08,957
They're here.

1768
03:12:12,064 --> 03:12:14,532
They've come.

1769
03:12:17,136 --> 03:12:19,036
Nazgul!

1770
03:12:41,093 --> 03:12:43,254
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1771
03:12:45,064 --> 03:12:47,294
Take cover!

1772
03:13:04,650 --> 03:13:06,208
The fortress is taken.

1773
03:13:06,986 --> 03:13:08,180
It is over.

1774
03:13:08,354 --> 03:13:12,290
You said this fortress would never
fall while your men defend it.

1775
03:13:12,458 --> 03:13:15,393
They still defend it. They have died defending it.

1776
03:13:18,130 --> 03:13:19,529
They're breaking in!

1777
03:13:22,168 --> 03:13:24,659
They're past the door!

1778
03:13:28,040 --> 03:13:32,170
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1779
03:13:34,780 --> 03:13:36,714
Is there no other way?

1780
03:13:38,284 --> 03:13:41,344
There is one passage. It leads into the mountains.

1781
03:13:42,021 --> 03:13:44,216
But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

1782
03:13:49,094 --> 03:13:51,494
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1783
03:13:51,664 --> 03:13:54,531
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1784
03:13:56,735 --> 03:14:00,136
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

1785
03:14:04,810 --> 03:14:06,243
Ride out with me.

1786
03:14:10,349 --> 03:14:11,976
Ride out and meet them.

1787
03:14:12,751 --> 03:14:14,912
For death and glory.

1788
03:14:15,087 --> 03:14:16,486
For Rohan.

1789
03:14:17,990 --> 03:14:19,457
For your people.

1790
03:14:20,192 --> 03:14:22,126
The sun is rising.

1791
03:14:26,632 --> 03:14:29,624
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

1792
03:14:29,802 --> 03:14:31,201
At dawn...

1793
03:14:31,403 --> 03:14:33,064
look to the east.

1794
03:14:37,243 --> 03:14:38,870
Yes.

1795
03:14:41,347 --> 03:14:43,008
Yes.

1796
03:14:44,350 --> 03:14:46,750
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1797
03:14:46,919 --> 03:14:49,717
shall sound in the Deep...

1798
03:14:50,155 --> 03:14:52,146
one last time.

1799
03:14:52,324 --> 03:14:53,814
Yes!

1800
03:14:56,862 --> 03:15:00,662
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

1801
03:15:08,474 --> 03:15:09,805
Fell deeds, awake.

1802
03:15:11,010 --> 03:15:12,068
Now for wrath...

1803
03:15:12,278 --> 03:15:15,679
now for ruin and a red dawn.

1804
03:15:22,721 --> 03:15:24,985
Forth Eorlingas!

1805
03:16:12,771 --> 03:16:13,965
Gandalf.

1806
03:16:21,280 --> 03:16:24,943
Theoden King stands alone.

1807
03:16:25,551 --> 03:16:27,712
Not alone.

1808
03:16:28,120 --> 03:16:29,246
Rohirrim!

1809
03:16:35,160 --> 03:16:36,320
Eomer.

1810
03:16:36,495 --> 03:16:39,020
To the king!

1811
03:17:56,675 --> 03:17:58,438
Yes!

1812
03:18:07,586 --> 03:18:11,022
A hit. A fine hit.

1813
03:18:35,547 --> 03:18:38,015
Break the dam!

1814
03:18:38,183 --> 03:18:41,619
Release the river!

1815
03:19:08,981 --> 03:19:11,711
Pippin! Hold on!

1816
03:19:16,989 --> 03:19:19,924
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1817
03:20:01,233 --> 03:20:03,258
What are you doing?

1818
03:20:11,877 --> 03:20:13,401
Where are you going?

1819
03:21:11,603 --> 03:21:12,900
It's me.

1820
03:21:15,440 --> 03:21:17,635
It's your Sam.

1821
03:21:21,980 --> 03:21:24,608
Don't you know your Sam?

1822
03:21:42,267 --> 03:21:45,634
I can't do this, Sam.

1823
03:21:46,571 --> 03:21:48,539
I know.

1824
03:21:49,574 --> 03:21:51,940
It's all wrong.

1825
03:21:52,678 --> 03:21:54,703
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1826
03:22:02,120 --> 03:22:04,213
But we are.

1827
03:22:10,629 --> 03:22:13,655
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1828
03:22:13,832 --> 03:22:16,232
The ones that really mattered.

1829
03:22:17,269 --> 03:22:20,261
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1830
03:22:20,472 --> 03:22:23,441
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...

1831
03:22:23,608 --> 03:22:26,543
because how could the end be happy?

1832
03:22:29,114 --> 03:22:31,309
How could the world go back to the way it was...

1833
03:22:31,483 --> 03:22:34,919
when so much bad had happened?

1834
03:22:35,754 --> 03:22:37,654
Victory!

1835
03:22:37,823 --> 03:22:39,381
We have victory!

1836
03:22:39,558 --> 03:22:43,494
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

1837
03:22:43,662 --> 03:22:44,993
this shadow.

1838
03:22:45,163 --> 03:22:47,563
Even darkness must pass.

1839
03:22:47,733 --> 03:22:50,429
A new day will come.

1840
03:22:50,635 --> 03:22:54,571
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

1841
03:22:56,508 --> 03:22:58,874
Those were the stories that stayed with you...

1842
03:22:59,044 --> 03:23:00,807
that meant something.

1843
03:23:00,979 --> 03:23:03,539
Even if you were too small to understand why.

1844
03:23:04,916 --> 03:23:08,784
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1845
03:23:08,954 --> 03:23:10,512
I know now.

1846
03:23:11,356 --> 03:23:13,551
Folk in those stories...

1847
03:23:13,725 --> 03:23:17,855
had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

1848
03:23:18,029 --> 03:23:20,259
They kept going...

1849
03:23:20,932 --> 03:23:24,197
because they were holding on to something.

1850
03:23:25,837 --> 03:23:28,135
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1851
03:23:40,018 --> 03:23:43,954
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1852
03:23:44,222 --> 03:23:46,850
And it's worth fighting for.

1853
03:24:13,785 --> 03:24:18,085
I think at last we understand
one another, Frodo Baggins.

1854
03:24:18,824 --> 03:24:22,783
You know the laws of our
country, the laws of your father.

1855
03:24:22,961 --> 03:24:25,156
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

1856
03:24:29,534 --> 03:24:30,933
Then it is forfeit.

1857
03:24:33,705 --> 03:24:35,400
Release them.

1858
03:24:47,486 --> 03:24:49,545
Stay out of the forest!

1859
03:24:49,721 --> 03:24:51,518
Keep away from the trees!

1860
03:25:42,340 --> 03:25:44,137
Final count...

1861
03:25:44,309 --> 03:25:47,210
- 42.
- 42?

1862
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:53,447
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

1863
03:25:54,252 --> 03:25:57,915
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1864
03:26:02,027 --> 03:26:05,326
- 43.
- He was already dead.

1865
03:26:06,097 --> 03:26:08,588
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1866
03:26:08,767 --> 03:26:13,466
because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

1867
03:26:15,707 --> 03:26:20,406
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1868
03:26:20,679 --> 03:26:24,206
Still, I suppose the view would
be quite nice from up there.

1869
03:26:24,382 --> 03:26:27,351
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1870
03:26:27,519 --> 03:26:30,352
I hear the staff are very good.

1871
03:26:36,027 --> 03:26:38,393
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1872
03:26:38,563 --> 03:26:42,829
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1873
03:26:43,001 --> 03:26:44,229
I'm starving.

1874
03:26:44,436 --> 03:26:47,496
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

1875
03:26:47,706 --> 03:26:50,732
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1876
03:27:14,733 --> 03:27:17,133
Saruman's storeroom!

1877
03:27:19,504 --> 03:27:22,200
I don't believe it.

1878
03:27:22,407 --> 03:27:24,432
It can't be.

1879
03:27:25,076 --> 03:27:27,977
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1880
03:27:29,280 --> 03:27:31,578
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1881
03:27:31,950 --> 03:27:34,976
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1882
03:27:35,153 --> 03:27:36,279
Wait.

1883
03:27:37,022 --> 03:27:38,250
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

1884
03:27:38,423 --> 03:27:39,947
Share it?

1885
03:27:41,793 --> 03:27:44,193
No. No.

1886
03:27:45,697 --> 03:27:47,028
Dead plant and all that.

1887
03:27:47,465 --> 03:27:49,626
Don't think he'd understand.

1888
03:27:50,935 --> 03:27:53,096
Could be a distant relative.

1889
03:27:53,905 --> 03:27:56,396
I get it.

1890
03:27:56,608 --> 03:27:59,406
Don't be hasty.

1891
03:28:00,512 --> 03:28:02,275
Exactly.

1892
03:28:03,348 --> 03:28:05,612
Bar-hrum.

1893
03:28:31,276 --> 03:28:32,573
This is the old sewer.

1894
03:28:32,744 --> 03:28:35,804
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1895
03:28:35,980 --> 03:28:37,709
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1896
03:28:38,783 --> 03:28:41,251
Captain Faramir...

1897
03:28:41,886 --> 03:28:43,717
you have shown your quality, sir.

1898
03:28:46,224 --> 03:28:47,521
The very highest.

1899
03:28:48,026 --> 03:28:50,654
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

1900
03:28:50,829 --> 03:28:53,764
where gardeners are held in high honor.

1901
03:28:54,966 --> 03:28:56,934
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

1902
03:28:57,569 --> 03:28:59,093
Gollum says there's a path...

1903
03:28:59,304 --> 03:29:03,240
near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

1904
03:29:03,708 --> 03:29:05,437
Cirith Ungol?

1905
03:29:08,980 --> 03:29:11,540
- Is that its name?
- No.

1906
03:29:11,716 --> 03:29:13,377
No!

1907
03:29:14,219 --> 03:29:17,211
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1908
03:29:17,589 --> 03:29:21,116
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1909
03:29:22,026 --> 03:29:24,551
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1910
03:29:24,896 --> 03:29:31,165
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

1911
03:29:32,704 --> 03:29:34,467
I must.

1912
03:29:38,009 --> 03:29:41,570
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1913
03:29:41,746 --> 03:29:43,771
Thank you.

1914
03:29:55,593 --> 03:29:59,723
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

1915
03:30:12,210 --> 03:30:13,734
Come on, keep up.

1916
03:30:17,215 --> 03:30:20,013
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

1917
03:30:20,652 --> 03:30:22,483
You know that, don't you?

1918
03:30:23,288 --> 03:30:24,846
He was trying to save you, see?

1919
03:30:25,356 --> 03:30:26,880
Save me?

1920
03:30:27,225 --> 03:30:29,386
So there's no hard feelings.

1921
03:30:29,561 --> 03:30:34,624
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1922
03:30:34,799 --> 03:30:37,427
Gollum, Gollum.

1923
03:30:38,503 --> 03:30:40,232
Yes, master.

1924
03:30:41,339 --> 03:30:44,172
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1925
03:30:44,342 --> 03:30:46,640
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1926
03:30:52,150 --> 03:30:57,349
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

1927
03:31:04,495 --> 03:31:07,487
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1928
03:31:08,166 --> 03:31:11,693
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

1929
03:31:16,875 --> 03:31:20,311
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

1930
03:31:21,279 --> 03:31:24,510
somewhere in the wilderness.

1931
03:31:27,819 --> 03:31:31,220
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

1932
03:31:31,389 --> 03:31:32,754
What?

1933
03:31:32,924 --> 03:31:36,826
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1934
03:31:36,995 --> 03:31:40,260
And they'll say, "Yes! That's
one of my favorite stories."

1935
03:31:40,431 --> 03:31:43,366
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

1936
03:31:43,534 --> 03:31:45,195
"Yes, my boy.

1937
03:31:45,403 --> 03:31:49,203
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1938
03:31:49,374 --> 03:31:51,865
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

1939
03:31:52,076 --> 03:31:53,976
"Samwise the Brave."

1940
03:31:54,145 --> 03:31:56,875
I want to hear more about Sam.

1941
03:32:01,185 --> 03:32:04,177
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

1942
03:32:05,523 --> 03:32:09,550
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't
make fun. I was being serious.

1943
03:32:10,662 --> 03:32:12,027
So was I.

1944
03:32:20,939 --> 03:32:23,601
"Samwise the Brave."

1945
03:32:27,912 --> 03:32:29,243
Smeagol?

1946
03:32:29,414 --> 03:32:32,315
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

1947
03:32:32,483 --> 03:32:34,417
Master.

1948
03:32:34,585 --> 03:32:37,486
Master looks after us.

1949
03:32:38,256 --> 03:32:41,054
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1950
03:32:41,225 --> 03:32:43,693
Master broke his promise.

1951
03:32:43,861 --> 03:32:46,022
Don't ask Smeagol.

1952
03:32:46,197 --> 03:32:49,394
Poor, poor Smeagol.

1953
03:32:49,567 --> 03:32:52,400
Master betrayed us.

1954
03:32:52,603 --> 03:32:55,663
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1955
03:32:55,873 --> 03:32:59,775
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

1956
03:32:59,944 --> 03:33:02,674
Kill him! Kill him!

1957
03:33:02,847 --> 03:33:04,337
Kill them both!

1958
03:33:04,515 --> 03:33:08,144
And then we take the precious...

1959
03:33:08,319 --> 03:33:11,846
and we be the master!

1960
03:33:12,523 --> 03:33:15,185
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1961
03:33:15,360 --> 03:33:18,022
Eyes always watching.

1962
03:33:18,196 --> 03:33:21,757
Then we stabs them out.

1963
03:33:21,933 --> 03:33:26,427
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

1964
03:33:26,637 --> 03:33:30,073
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1965
03:33:30,274 --> 03:33:32,970
Kill them both.

1966
03:33:33,144 --> 03:33:35,544
Yes. No! No!

1967
03:33:35,747 --> 03:33:39,444
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1968
03:33:40,151 --> 03:33:42,745
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1969
03:33:42,920 --> 03:33:45,514
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

1970
03:33:45,690 --> 03:33:51,094
We could let her do it.

1971
03:33:52,063 --> 03:33:56,193
Yes. She could do it.

1972
03:33:56,367 --> 03:34:00,929
Yes, precious, she could.

1973
03:34:01,139 --> 03:34:07,135
And then we takes it once they're dead.

1974
03:34:08,112 --> 03:34:10,945
Once they're dead.

1975
03:34:15,353 --> 03:34:19,050
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1976
03:34:19,223 --> 03:34:21,282
Smeagol will show you the way.

1977
03:34:21,459 --> 03:34:23,689
Follow me.
