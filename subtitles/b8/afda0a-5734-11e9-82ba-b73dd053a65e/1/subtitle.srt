1
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,112
- Dr. Snow?
- Yes?

2
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,276
- Dr. Bartholomew Snow?
- Yes.

3
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,031
General Pratt would like
a word with you.

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,639
- General Pratt?
- Yes, sir. On official business.

5
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,914
- Well, Dr. Snow?
- Yes.

6
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,388
My identification.

7
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
Forgive the unorthodox approach.
Can't be overheard here.

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,153
National Security Agency?

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,280
We're just two friends who
stopped to chat in the park.

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,795
Five years ago you treated
a scientist, Arthur Vincenti.

11
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,470
- Arthur Vincenti?
- A Theoretical Physicist.

12
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,750
Arthur Vincenti. Yes.

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,437
Neurotic symptoms. Deeply disturbed,
responded well to treatment.

14
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,072
- Yes, I remember.
- Correct.

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,636
Vincenti is working for the Government.

16
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,791
An extremely sensitive position.

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,396
He need your help again.
Urgently.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,556
Anything I can do, of course.
Send him around.

19
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,479
That's the trouble, I can't.
I have to take you to him.

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,993
- Where is he?
- That's classified information.

21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,309
Top secret.

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,396
I'm all for security, General,

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,480
but I can't treat a patient
- even a top secret patient...

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,039
without knowing where he is.

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,270
That's what I must ask you to do.

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,350
To put yourself in my hands
and come into this blindfolded.

27
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,235
- This is unusual...
- Good, I was sure you'd cooperate.

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,554
What about my practice?
I have patients...

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,719
We want you to continue
in your normal routine.

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,759
We don't want to call attention to you.
We'll preempt some of your evenings.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,998
Mr. Barker will be your contact.

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,872
He'll call for you at your house at six.

33
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,348
- Tonight.
- That's right.

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,717
I'm sorry,
I have an important engagement.

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,677
- Personal matter.
- Cancel it.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,958
Nothing is as important as this.
Six sharp.

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,999
Wear a black tie,
as if you were going to a party.

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,594
Makes good cover.
Grateful to you, Doctor.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,752
And not a word to anyone.

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,270
Our security must be air-tight,
a work of art.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,989
Yes, General.

42
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,991
One more thing:

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,954
call me George.

44
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,874
Yes, George.

45
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,670
Miss Farrington's line
is still busy, Doctor.

46
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,154
- Thanks.
- And I wish

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,157
when you want one old file,
you'd ask me

48
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,034
- instead of just taking it.
- This one's reactivated, I'll keep it.

49
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,393
- And keep trying Miss Farrington.
- Yes, Doctor.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,236
I beg your pardon. I mu... must have
come in through the wrong door.

51
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,836
I wanted to make an appointment.

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,917
My name's Fitzpatrick.

53
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,908
- Miss Smith.
- This way, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

54
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,312
Miss Farrington is on one.

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,148
Hello, Pam.

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,637
Look...
I won't be able to make it tonight.

57
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,996
I know we were supposed
to announce our engagement...

58
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,315
It's an emergency.

59
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,475
What?

60
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,712
I'm not trying to back out.

61
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,317
I have the ring right here.

62
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,633
Pam, I tell you I just can't.

63
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,436
It's a military secret.

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,870
No, it's not a ridiculous excuse.

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,951
No, there's not another woman.

66
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,272
Why have we always to get
into these shouting matches?

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,156
All right, call the newspapers.

68
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,392
All right, your mother warned you.

69
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,832
She said you were a Bluebeard.

70
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,032
She said you were nuts,
like all the psychiatrists.

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,475
She said what?

72
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,955
She said all the psychiatrists
are nuts?

73
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,114
Let me tell you something
about your mother.

74
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,674
Congratulations.

75
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,628
I wondered how you were going
to get out of that one.

76
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,989
You'll like Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Typical Madison Avenue syndrome.

77
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,353
- I'll make the diagnosis.
- Yes, Doctor.

78
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,352
Smitty, I've told you 50 times
to throwthose photos away.

79
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,713
Why do you want to keep them?

80
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,752
I'm sentimental, that's all.

81
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,470
I don't know where we're going,
but I like to see where we've been.

82
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,754
Shall I return the ring
to Tiffany's again?

83
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,559
No, I'll return it myself.

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,468
You're getting
a lot of mileage out of it.

85
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,879
Miss Smith,

86
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,276
just because I've suffered
several disappointments,

87
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,710
you have the impression
that I am emotionally shallow.

88
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,196
On the contrary.
It's precisely

89
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,074
the warmth of my emotions
that causes these difficulties...

90
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,998
Mine is a tender spirit,

91
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,597
eager for love,
easily wounded.

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,479
Yes, Doctor.

93
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,952
Don't bleed on the rug.

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,195
- You wanna make a statement?
- No.

95
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,117
Doc, give yourself a break.

96
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,153
In the column tomorrow
Penelope Peek will say you're a Bluebeard!

97
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,669
- A Bluebeard?
- What kind of a doctor acts like this?

98
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,154
- I couldn't care less.
- Don't, Doc!

99
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,874
I'm trying to do you a favor... Doc!

100
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,550
- Are we being followed?
- Probably not,

101
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,637
but the General
always goes on that assumption.

102
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,430
Right on time.
Enjoy your ride?

103
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,551
Yeah, all three of 'em.

104
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,108
Sorry, Doctor.

105
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,354
In this business no one knows
any more than he has to.

106
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,631
Barker doesn't know
where the plane's going.

107
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,990
The pilot doesn't know
where we go after we land.

108
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,233
Only one person knows it all, me.
Security.

109
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,511
The Russians must be anxious
to get their hands on Vincenti.

110
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,272
Who said anything about Russians?

111
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,070
They already have
good men in this field.

112
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,834
Then why all the...?

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,878
What's the most valuable commodity
in the word today?

114
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,315
Brains.

115
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,471
The Arthur Vincenti kind of brains.

116
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,556
Every country in the world
competing for them.

117
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,709
Sooner or later someone was bound
to smell money in it. Big money.

118
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,391
We're up against
an International black market in brains.

119
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,116
Not political, in the usual sense,
but a business enterprise.

120
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,230
Scientific geniuses bought,
sold, traded,

121
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,518
and if necessary, kidnapped.

122
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,279
We learned about it
a few months ago

123
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,959
and they offered us a Russian
biological warfare expert

124
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,671
for a million dollars in gold.

125
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,551
- You bought?
- Last year's model.

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,033
Our people weren't interested.

127
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,432
We've been tipped off
that the next target is Arthur Vincenti.

128
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,314
In his present mental state,
he'd be a natural for them.

129
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,439
Can't be much of a market
if the Russians don't want him.

130
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,395
Whoever tipped us off didn't want
the Red Chinese to have him.

131
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,036
- Are you saying...?
- I'm not saying anything.

132
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,436
Except that it's a more complicated world
than some people think.

133
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,833
Especially in our game.

134
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,592
It's going to be a long night.

135
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,355
Put your feet up
and get some sleep.

136
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,599
I intend to...

137
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,395
Above all, don't worry.

138
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,832
You reassure me.

139
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,433
How often I've told my patients
not to worry

140
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,877
in exactly the same tone
of ringing sincerity.

141
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,997
Captain Davis
of the Medical Corps.

142
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,155
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

143
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,269
All right, Doctor.

144
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,199
Wait a minute, what...?

145
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,194
I didn't know you meant
this blindfold business literally.

146
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,151
I'm not likely to try to find
this place by myself.

147
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,436
We want to spare you the temptation.
Let's go.

148
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,879
- This way.
- Watch your head.

149
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,351
- Thanks.
- Watch your step.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,639
Your notions of security puzzle me.

151
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,280
- Why?
- These people can see us.

152
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,919
Here's the car.

153
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,829
Step up six inches
and watch your head.

154
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,359
Sounds like a party!

155
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,035
Do you always tie knots
in cellophane?

156
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,592
That's a symptom of something?

157
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,313
All obsessive behavior
is symptomatic of something.

158
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,598
- Are you a psychiatrist, Captain...?
- Davis.

159
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,279
No, I'm an internist.

160
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,831
The General want a medical man
until a specialist could take over.

161
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,355
That's a bridge.

162
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,189
- Sorry, can't help playing detective.
- Very good.

163
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,229
We crossed
one of America's 50,000 rivers.

164
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,158
Somebody holding choir practice?

165
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,030
- Here we are.
- But where?

166
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,633
Obviously some place on the South.

167
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,240
You're the detective.
Let's call it Base X.

168
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,474
This way, Doctor.

169
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,553
- Is that an unlisted number?
- Yes. We can call out

170
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,828
but nobody calls in.

171
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,714
He's all yours, Doctor.

172
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,919
Hello, Arthur.

173
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,309
Arthur...

174
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,196
You know me, don't you, Arthur?

175
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,069
Yes.

176
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,308
I knowyou.

177
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,469
Dr. Bartholomew Snow.

178
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,468
Dr. Snow.

179
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,956
The famous psychiatrist.

180
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,993
Dr. Snow.

181
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,918
The traitor!

182
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,952
Traitor!

183
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,674
Traitor!

184
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,313
- Put him on the bed.
- Let me go!

185
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,516
Wait! Let me go!

186
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,949
Let me go!

187
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,271
Let me go!

188
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,998
- Black, all right?
- Yes, fine.

189
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,077
There you have, Doctor.
We're the enemy.

190
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,198
His co-workers, me,
Captain Davis, now you.

191
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,079
He's security gone all haywire.

192
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,349
He's security turned
inside out, upside down.

193
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,591
He tried to destroy his own work.
Two years of priceless stuff.

194
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,153
Sedative's working.
He'll sleep now.

195
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,633
- Your coat.
- Thank you.

196
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,511
Here's what worries me.

197
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,430
Is it possible for all this
to operate in reverse?

198
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,394
If we're the enemy and

199
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,476
they should get hold of him
in his present state,

200
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,198
couldn't they brainwash him into
thinking they're his real friends?

201
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,676
It's possible.
We all need to trust in someone.

202
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,917
- They could reach him that way.
- Could you reach him first?

203
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,352
In time.
Given a regular course of treatment.

204
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,240
You've just talked yourself
out of a lot of sleep.

205
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,679
It'll be down
before we get back to New York.

206
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,355
At eight o'clock you're on that bridle path
for your usual ride.

207
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,389
What?

208
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,552
It's essential that there be no break
in your normal routine.

209
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,078
I don't care how many times
we have to come back here.

210
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,680
Why here?
Why not a military hospital?

211
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,436
Because all of this is illegal.

212
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,429
lllegal?

213
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,552
Vincenti's a civilian.
We have no right to restrain him.

214
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,236
If we want to commit him
to a hospital,

215
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,676
there's the whole routine
of medical boards, lawyers,

216
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,833
and the press might get wind of it.

217
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,191
Might even have to release him
and then our friends could grab 'im.

218
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,676
So for his own safety,
I grabbed him first.

219
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,150
Put out a cover story
that he'd gone fishing.

220
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,872
In law, I'm a kidnapper.

221
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,312
And I'm an accessory.

222
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,236
Here's to crime!

223
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,754
Good morning.

224
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,948
- Are you all right?
- Why didn't you blowyour horn?

225
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,350
You crossed right in front of me.
I couldn't avoid you.

226
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,190
Bicycle are not allowed
on the bridle path.

227
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,117
Horses shouldn't be allowed
on the bridle path.

228
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,312
Bridle paths are for horses.
Read the signs: no bicycles.

229
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,389
Keep out of this.

230
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,355
My knee...
It's probably broken.

231
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,913
Come on, break it up here.

232
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,713
What's the matter, Doc?
Can I help?

233
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,751
- No, thank you.
- Did you say doctor?

234
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,309
Yes, this is Dr. Bartholomew Snow.

235
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,915
If you're a doctor
don't stand there.

236
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,912
I'll have a look at it.

237
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,912
I'm not that kind of a doctor.

238
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,509
What are you, a horse doctor?

239
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,273
It doesn't seem to be broken.

240
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,430
I could recommend
a good Orthopedist.

241
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,632
I need a good lawyer.

242
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,629
You saw it, Officer.

243
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,792
He was speeding.
Failed to make the proper hand signal.

244
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,559
You did see it?

245
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,229
Yeah.

246
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,398
Ya oughta watch it.

247
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,071
I've noticed that in the last week
you fall asleep at the wheel.

248
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,390
I've been working nights lately.

249
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,713
What am I explaining to you for?
Who's this girl?

250
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,792
Vail, Victoria Vail,
the ballet dancer.

251
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,199
So you haven't heard of me.

252
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,114
But you will. You would have,
if you hadn't run over me!

253
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,878
I didn't run over you.

254
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,479
I'll never dance again.

255
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,349
A talent nipped in the bud.
Crippled for life.

256
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,595
- I'm terribly sorry.
- All because of you...

257
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,718
and that hay-burning hot rod.

258
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,631
Miss, please don't cry.

259
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,033
This is an emergency.

260
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,633
So that's an emergency.

261
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,111
Now, we'll look at that knee.

262
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,754
Excuse me...

263
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,235
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,077
It seems to work perfectly.

265
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,718
We must consider the possibility

266
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,069
that your symptoms
are psychosomatic.

267
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,594
I know what that means.

268
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,598
There's nothing wrong with the head.
The knee!

269
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,431
I can't fins anything wrong with it.

270
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,870
As a knee, I fins it
above criticism

271
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,354
in every way.

272
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,032
Mr. Barker is calling.

273
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,838
I'll take it in your office.

274
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,513
Excuse me, Miss Vail.

275
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,349
Excuse me.

276
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,555
Snow speaking.

277
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,876
Just a minute
he'd like to speak to you.

278
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,116
- Doctor?
- Yes, General.

279
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,676
Call me George,
the party's off for tonight.

280
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,313
I can use the sleep.
What's wrong?

281
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,793
Nothing serious.

282
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,390
Our friend took a little walk
after supper last night.

283
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,869
He escaped?

284
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,833
Not on the phone!

285
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,836
We found him
and he's back home.

286
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,193
We had to lull him to sleep.

287
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,273
We'll meet tomorrow
at the usual time.

288
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,874
All right, fine.

289
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,552
He thinks he's a General.

290
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,919
Nowthen, Miss Vail.

291
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,039
Miss Vail?

292
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,589
Where is she?

293
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,988
That's what I'd like to know.

294
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,148
Mr. Barker, please.

295
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,629
Just went out?

296
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,712
Have him call me the moment
he comes in. It's urgent.

297
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,637
This is Dr. Snow.
Thanks.

298
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,511
- Care to fill me in?
- I can't.

299
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,636
- I have to find that girl.
- Now, Doctor.

300
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,955
Nueva York is knee-deep in girls.

301
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,273
She said she was a ballet dancer
and she looked like one.

302
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,079
Broadway, the theatre and all that...

303
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,831
There's no Victoria Vail.
I need someone who knows that world.

304
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,796
What's the name of that creep I can't stand
and who works with Penelope?

305
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,798
- Lippy?
- Yeah, find him for me.

306
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,074
You must have it real bad this time.

307
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,391
A real exclusive.
Dr. Bluebeard's Number 7.

308
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,639
- But she said ballet.
- That's what took me so long finding her.

309
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,030
You want Victoria Vail,
be my guest.

310
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,631
Roger, we'll pick him up.

311
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,678
Doc, doc!

312
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,117
Make it quick, I've got a date
at the police station.

313
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,915
I would like to have
what you took out of my office.

314
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,952
You mean this?
No, you don't. This is evidence.

315
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,435
Evidence of what?

316
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,795
That you helped kidnap my brother.

317
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,518
- Your what?
- My brother.

318
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,914
Arthur Vincenti.

319
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,598
Why would I want to kidnap him?

320
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,193
To brainwash him, that's why.

321
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,556
Arthur called me last night.

322
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,115
Does that surprise you?

323
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,114
He said he was being held
by a bunch of spies.

324
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,675
Some phony general
and you, Dr. Snow.

325
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,150
Do you think the police would believe
such a ridiculous story?

326
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,231
So they didn't,
but now I've got proof.

327
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,516
You can't go to the police,
it would mean publicity.

328
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,118
Everything we're trying to avoid.

329
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,753
Let go of me.

330
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,993
- What goes on here?
- He assaulted me.

331
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,273
You nasty man!

332
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,158
Bluebeard, look over here.

333
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,789
A beauty!

334
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,428
- What goes on here?
- Nothing serious.

335
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,198
Our friend here had a drop too much.

336
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,470
- We'll see that he gets home all right.
- College reunion.

337
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,993
No, you don't.

338
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,310
He assaulted me
and I'm preferring charges.

339
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,754
Officer, do your duty.

340
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,195
- You want to make a formal charge?
- I certainly do.

341
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,431
He's an un-American activity.

342
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,239
Whatever you say.

343
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,036
- Wait!
- Come on.

344
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,236
You've gotta make up your mind.

345
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,473
Is he a sex maniac or is he a spy?

346
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,751
Both, and he broke my knee.

347
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,872
How did he break your knee?

348
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,997
He ran over me with this horse.

349
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,510
He ran over you with this...

350
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,997
Lady, this is Dr. Bartholomew Snow.

351
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,639
Everybody knows him.

352
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,911
The Commissioner's wife
is one of his patients.

353
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,399
You want me to book him?

354
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,791
- You ever hear of false arrest?
- He knows where my brother is.

355
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,279
We've got no evidence?

356
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,992
But you've got this file.

357
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,512
The Doctor explained

358
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,910
that he treated your brother 5 years ago.

359
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,798
But he hasn't explained
why some of these entries are fresh.

360
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,912
One of them was made today.

361
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,511
Yeah.

362
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,599
We talked to the Commanding Officer
at that Army Base.

363
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,957
He says this Arthur Vincenti
is off on a fishing trip.

364
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,998
He says lay off, everything is okay.

365
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,200
- But it's impossible.
- You heard the man.

366
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,353
- I'm sorry you were inconvenienced.
- Thanks.

367
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,674
Let's go, Miss Vincenti.

368
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,828
Thank you.

369
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,149
Dames...

370
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,030
- What'll they think of?
- Yeah.

371
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,197
But you know something?
The Doc was Iying, too.

372
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,471
Your coat, Miss Vincenti.
I hope you're reassured.

373
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,239
Arthur hates fishing.

374
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,437
Even in a rowboat he gets sick.

375
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,993
You don't believe the United States Army?

376
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,837
I believe that phone call form my brother.

377
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,592
And I'm going to do something about it.

378
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,153
What, for instance?

379
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,756
You're news, Dr. Bluebeard.
In this country we have a free press.

380
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,149
Boys!

381
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,637
Hold it, boys.
Hold it.

382
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,349
Let me tell them.

383
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,200
Gentlemen,
I wish to make an announcement

384
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,515
that Miss Vail and I

385
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,916
are engaged to be married.

386
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,750
¡No, es mentira!
¡No lo conozco de nada!

387
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,158
¡No le conozco!
¡No le había visto nunca!

388
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,274
Taxi!

389
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,239
- Can I drop you?
- Like a hot potato.

390
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,113
71 West Park.

391
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,474
It's real.

392
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,111
Why'd you pull a cockeyed stunt
like that?

393
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,639
I had to keep you from talking.

394
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,199
Then you kidnap him.

395
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,238
You don't really believe that, do you?

396
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,276
- But he called me.
- How did he sound?

397
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,669
Think about it.

398
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,756
Sort of mixed up.

399
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,513
He said he'd gotten away.
He was calling from some gas station.

400
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,636
He said you were after him.

401
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,510
He's in good hands,
that's all I can tell you.

402
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,110
- Then you have seen him?
- I'm treating him.

403
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,154
At the Army's request.
I can't say any more.

404
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
- Trust me.
- I do.

405
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,797
When you said we were engaged...

406
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,513
Such a cockeyed stunt.

407
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,632
A spy wouldn't pull
a cockeyed stunt like that.

408
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,230
- Would you?
- No.

409
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,756
Only a congenital idiot.

410
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,198
It'll be spread all over the papers.
Do you mind?

411
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,189
Publicity?
In show business? It never hurts.

412
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,595
Even for a ballet dancer?

413
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,869
Listen, Mister.

414
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,116
On the level I'm studying ballet.

415
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,551
I don't intend to spend
the rest of my life on a chorus line.

416
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,432
I trust you, Doctor,
but not that far.

417
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,957
Bluebeard, down.

418
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,955
Doctor?

419
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,589
Doctor.

420
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,509
Doctor.

421
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,028
We're here.

422
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,388
- Would you like to come up for a drink?
- Not your home, mine.

423
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,954
Wait here, will you?

424
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,476
- Well, good night.
- Goodnight.

425
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,036
- Are you sure that Arthur is all right?
- He's all right, believe me.

426
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,436
I'm stuck with believing you.

427
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,918
Let me.

428
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,315
The ring.

429
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,359
Bluebeard, what you need is
an adjustable engagement ring.

430
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,070
I guess you'll have to bring it
to me tomorrow.

431
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,788
Tomorrow?

432
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,948
I really ought to check up on that knee.

433
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,674
Sure.

434
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,515
Well.

435
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,714
Well.

436
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,754
Well.

437
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,348
Doctor.

438
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,153
My key.

439
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,311
Of all the cockeyed stunts!

440
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,517
Why'd you have to draw
all this attention to yourself?

441
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,835
Security.

442
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,876
You call this security,
Vincenti's sister?

443
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,269
It was the only thing I could do
to keep her from talking.

444
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,993
You didn't have to get engaged to her.

445
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,278
It's my behavior pattern.
I keep asking girls to marry me.

446
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,834
Other men feel compelled to drink,
gamble, get into fights.

447
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,389
- I get engaged.
- The engagement is off.

448
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,392
Break it at once!
That's an order.

449
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,555
- Yes, General.
- And don't call me that!

450
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,792
- Call me George!
- Yes, George.

451
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,795
Good afternoon.

452
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,908
Mr. Fitzpatrick.

453
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,188
Yes.

454
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,634
Excuse me.

455
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,436
Thank you.
Mr. Fitzpatrick.

456
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,028
Come in.

457
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,592
Make yourself comfortable.

458
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,677
- Do you mind if we record?
- No, no.

459
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,229
Then, we have
a little background here...

460
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,677
Sometimes it helps to say
the first that comes to your mind.

461
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,672
The first thing that comes to my mind
is that I'm keeping you up.

462
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,674
CIA.

463
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,552
You are clever.

464
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,632
That stutter of yours
sounds authentic.

465
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,951
It's authentic,
I used to stutter but I cured myself.

466
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,670
- Will power.
- You cured the symptom.

467
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,312
Laymen often make that mistake,
under strain you may stutter again.

468
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,909
I'm not here to discuss my symptoms.

469
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,637
I'm here to check on the disappearance
of the certain Vincenti.

470
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,479
You do know him?

471
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,758
I believe I once had a patient
by that name.

472
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,472
You say he disappeared?

473
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,393
He was kidnapped from his apartment,
near the base where he worked.

474
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,429
But that...

475
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,511
Where you about to say, Doctor,
that it wasn't a real kidnapping?

476
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,157
I was wondering

477
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,757
if he's disturbed
why he couldn't have just wandered off?

478
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,076
What gives you the impression
he's disturbed?

479
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,032
His medical history.

480
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,953
He was my patient.

481
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,113
Arthur Vincenti
today is completely sane.

482
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,835
And completely loyal.
Even fanatically so.

483
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,549
He'd resist any attempt
to make him talk

484
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,909
or to brainwash him.

485
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,798
Even a plausible attempt
carried out with in all innocence

486
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,758
by a reputable psychiatrist
such as yourself.

487
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,876
Are you accusing me
of brainwashing him?

488
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,197
I'm accusing you of being the key.

489
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,752
The innocent key with which the man
you know as the General,

490
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,434
hopes to open the closed mind
of Arthur Vincenti.

491
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,877
Shall we stop playing games,
where is Arthur Vincenti?

492
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,269
I don't know.

493
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,869
I even know how many trips
you've made to the place the General

494
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,275
calls Base X.

495
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,590
I understand the nature
of your dilemma.

496
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,718
Undoubtedly the General
showed you credentials,

497
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,033
but did you check them?

498
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,789
You can check mine. Here.

499
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,954
It's the CIA number in Washington.

500
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,991
My section Chief is Mr. Gilmore.

501
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,474
Call him.

502
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,551
What's the point calling?

503
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,831
I see no reason
to check your credentials.

504
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,918
Very well, if that's the way you
want to play it.

505
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,275
I'll be back tomorrow with the US Marshalls
and a warrant for your arrest.

506
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,469
Doctor,

507
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,118
when you're with the General
at the Base X,

508
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,953
better not mention my visit.

509
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,670
Once he learns we've made contact
with you, you'll be of no further use to him

510
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,915
alive.

511
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,439
Have a pleasant trip.

512
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,316
- Hello?
- Mr. Barker, please.

513
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,552
Hello?
Who is it?

514
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,994
Smitty!

515
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,676
Get me this number.
No, get it from the operator.

516
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,909
Get what?

517
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,231
The CIA. Central Intelligence Agency,
in Washington.

518
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,594
Yes, Doctor.

519
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,279
And this man showed you credentials
issued by this office?

520
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,158
That's what I'm trying to find out.

521
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,077
Do you have a James Fitzpatrick
in your Section?

522
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,229
I'm not authorized to give you
our information regarding our personnel.

523
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,759
Who is authorized?

524
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,639
Mr. Gilmore, but he's out.

525
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,917
Out of the office or out of town?

526
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,036
I'm not authorized to say.

527
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,469
Look,

528
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,797
can't you just tell me whether
or not you have a James Fitzpatrick

529
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,875
in your Section?

530
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,512
I'm sorry, I'm not authorized.

531
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,354
- Smitty.
- Yes, Doctor.

532
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,750
Get me the Military Intel...

533
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,199
No, the National Security Agency.

534
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,748
No, sir.

535
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,953
For security reasons keeps
no central file on personnel.

536
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,398
If you wish to communicate
with this General Pratt,

537
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,475
write him a letter.

538
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,351
I don't wish to communicate with him.

539
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,633
I'm meeting him this evening,
in an hour.

540
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,117
I want to know if General Pratt
is or is not with your Agency.

541
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,718
This is hardly a matter
that should be discussed on the phone.

542
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,230
I don't wish to discuss
any of your secrets.

543
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,999
I just want to know
if you know General Pratt.

544
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,872
If General Pratt exists.

545
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,833
I'm not authorized

546
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,279
- to give out that info.
- To give out that info.

547
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,119
- Is there anyone authorized?
- No, sir.

548
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,350
Is there anyone authorized
to authorize you?

549
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,989
Just one person.

550
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,229
Who is it?

551
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,438
The President of the United States,
if you'd care to call him.

552
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,477
Yes. What's his phone number?

553
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,879
Doctor.

554
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,193
Good evening.

555
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,079
All right, Doc.

556
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,356
No, no.

557
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,833
We're not getting anywhere.

558
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,310
- We're using the wrong technique.
- General.

559
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,429
Hold it.

560
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,630
You've accused Dr. Snow
of brainwashing you.

561
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,035
Do you think your own sister...

562
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,071
- General, I don't think...
- Don't interfere.

563
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,313
Is it true, Doctor?

564
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,151
Is Vicky going to marry you?

565
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,949
Yes.

566
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,834
I guess...

567
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,118
I can use a little help.

568
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,758
There you are, Doctor.

569
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,952
That's enough for now.

570
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,476
- Why are you stalling?
- Stalling, George?

571
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,954
Yes. We just made a breakthrough.

572
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,275
We could have reached him.

573
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,432
- Why you destroyed the connection?
- Because it had gone far enough.

574
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,228
The mind's a very delicate mechanism.

575
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,080
- You can't operate on it with a meat axe.
- It worked.

576
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,635
Vincenti accepts you because
he thinks you're engaged to his sister.

577
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,148
Can you imagine the traumatic effect when
he finds out the engagement's a phony?

578
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,351
What do you mean, phony?

579
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,433
- If I'm to break it off tomorrow...
- Break it off?

580
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,473
- Who said that?
- You did and said it was an order.

581
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,199
You'll do nothing of the sort.

582
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,158
You're engaged to the girl.

583
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,394
And that's an order!

584
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,470
No, thanks.
I have to meet somebody.

585
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,111
Sorry to interrupt your ride,
we won't keep you long.

586
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,351
I suppose these are US Marshals
and you're serving that warrant, huh?

587
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,358
Businessmen, like psychiatrists,

588
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,152
can't always tell the truth.

589
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,318
You're a businessman
and these are...

590
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,315
your board of directors?
These Homburgs?

591
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,398
These are my salesmen.

592
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,988
Sell him, gentlemen.

593
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,430
And that's just the opening pitch.
Where is Base X?

594
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,159
I don't know.

595
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,759
Fellows!

596
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,317
Doctor, any man
can be made to talk in time.

597
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,519
Where is Base X?

598
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,596
I knowyou've been taken there 5 times.

599
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,440
You don't think the General
fooled me for a minute?

600
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,193
He did better, he fooled me.

601
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,639
Every time he took me there
I was blindfolded.

602
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,233
- Blindfolded?
- That brought back the symptom, didn't it?

603
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,399
Mr. Fitzpatrick,

604
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,910
I couldn't tell you where Base X is

605
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,915
if my life depended on it.

606
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,949
Get him!

607
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,355
The Navy!

608
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,555
- What?
- The Navy!

609
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,589
Let's go!

610
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,554
Miss Vincenti...

611
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,509
Hey, come back!

612
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,478
- Forgive me, I'm terribly sorry.
- No. Never!

613
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,991
- Why do you want to do this thing to me?
- But I didn't...

614
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,354
No, fellas.
That's my fiancé.

615
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,195
No, please, fellas!
That's my fiancé. No.

616
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,235
Listen, darling,
maybe we should stick around.

617
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,958
No, that's all right.

618
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,555
No, we'll make out all right, fellows.
Listen.

619
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,950
Remember,
not a word to anybody, okay?

620
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,111
- You can always count on the Navy.
- Okay.

621
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,269
Take it away, James.

622
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,555
- Bye. Thanks, fellas.
- Bye.

623
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,278
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

624
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,989
Goodbye.

625
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,079
I ought to call the General.
May I use your telephone?

626
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,317
Sure.
Anyway, it's time you met the family.

627
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,271
Does your family know
about your brother?

628
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,513
I didn't want to worry them.
All they know is that we are engaged.

629
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,955
How are you going to explain all this?

630
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,951
Let's see. This could be icing.
We were pricing a wedding cake.

631
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,319
And fell in?

632
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,389
Come on.

633
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,189
Mama.

634
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,269
Mama.

635
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,470
Oh, dottore, dottore.

636
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,394
I am so happy for my little girl.

637
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,154
- Zio, zio!
- Cosa c'è?

638
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,674
- Come quickly, see who's here.
- Va bene.

639
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,789
Mario!

640
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,279
A little wine?
We will have a drink to celebrate.

641
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,715
Aren't you going to ask
what happened to us?

642
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,712
In Italy I would ask.

643
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,276
In America I have learned
parents should be seen but not heard.

644
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,870
- Ma chi c'è?
- Doctor Snow.

645
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,992
Oh, Dr. Snow...
You do our family a great honor.

646
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,550
My uncle Michelangelo, the sculptor.
I'll get something for your face.

647
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,316
- Michelangelo? Any relation...?
- No, no. No relation. And no threat.

648
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,229
- For you.
- Thank you.

649
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,111
- Salute.
- Salute.

650
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,150
It is a shame Arturo is not here.
We are very proud of Arturo.

651
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,117
Arturo is a scientist.

652
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,432
I bring him from Italy myself
when he was just a little boy and now...

653
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,633
- He's an important man for the Government.
- We should not speak of this.

654
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,317
And this is my other son, Mario.
Dr. Snow.

655
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,311
- Hello, Mario.
- Hi, Dr. Snow.

656
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,829
Psychiatrist, huh?

657
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,034
- One of your patients slug you?
- You could put it that way.

658
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,832
I'd be interested to have your views

659
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,117
- on the merits of the post-Freudian schools.
- Mario!

660
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,437
Later.
Dr. Snow has to make a phone call.

661
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,672
- May I, please?
- For the new son of the house, of course.

662
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,197
I think Dr. Snowwants privacy.

663
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,348
Use the telephone in my studio, downstairs.
Very private, you know.

664
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,110
This is the first time
I've ever had this experience.

665
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,310
- What experience?
- Well...

666
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,752
When I meet a girl's family,
I feel an overwhelming compulsion to run.

667
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,155
- Not this time?
- No.

668
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,955
I wonder why.

669
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,676
Probably because
we're not really engaged.

670
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,914
There's the phone.

671
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,869
You see...

672
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,349
I hate to...

673
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,275
Here I am.

674
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,552
Your uncle's sculpture?
It's easy to guess who the model is.

675
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,119
What were you going to say?

676
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,317
I hate to play
such a dirty trick on your family.

677
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,149
I mean...

678
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,275
When they realize
the engagement's a phony...

679
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,112
Aren't you going to make your call?

680
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,869
Ah, yes.

681
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,436
I realize it's tough on you, too,
having to make this...

682
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,669
pretense.

683
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,595
- How long do we have to go on pretending?
- Till your brother's well again.

684
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,075
- Reception.
- Mr. Barker's room, please.

685
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,318
If it's for my brother...

686
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,308
And for your country.

687
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,593
- It's my duty as a citizen?
- The Stars and Stripes forever.

688
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,836
Oh, say, can you see.

689
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,595
Will you marry me?

690
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,154
- What?
- What?

691
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,909
George.

692
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,275
I have to talk to you right away.

693
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,070
35 years in the service.
I've seen foul-ups:

694
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,791
ordinary foul-ups, extraordinary foul-ups,
joint Army, Navy and Air Force foul-ups,

695
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,195
but this is the foul-up
to end all foul-ups.

696
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,799
I've checked with the CIA.

697
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,076
The real Fitzpatrick
is on his way to Singapore.

698
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,716
- Why didn't you tell me this?
- I thought maybe you were the phony.

699
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,633
I was the phony?

700
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,236
His credentials looked as good as yours.
I'm only human.

701
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,672
That's always the problem with security:
human beings.

702
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,110
- If we could just eliminate...
- People?

703
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,479
I guess that is asking too much.
Lipstick?

704
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,469
Mercurochrome.

705
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,672
Doctor, there's no way out.

706
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,269
- I'm gonna have to riff you.
- What's that mean?

707
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,030
Reduction in force.
Replace you.

708
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,876
You've become a liability
to the whole operation.

709
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,673
You might inadvertently give our enemies
the information they want:

710
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,393
the location of Base X.

711
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,076
But I don't even know it.
I even convinced Fitzpatrick I don't know it.

712
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,878
They know more than you think.

713
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,237
Every trip you've made to Base X,
your mind has stored up information.

714
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,955
- It's all there, in your subconscious.
- But what about my patient?

715
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,392
- Are you still indispensable?
- No...

716
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,509
Any competent man
could handle it now.

717
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,956
Got any ideas?
You know the qualifications.

718
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,557
Dr. Robert Burford of Bellevue.
You couldn't make a better choice.

719
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,679
Good. Barker'll drop by your office
and pick up the files.

720
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,876
Goodbye, Doctor.
We'll not meet again

721
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,953
and you have no further connection
with the case or the Vincenti family.

722
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,953
- What about my engagement.
- Break it now, tonight.

723
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,429
- Why?
- Do you want to endanger the girl?

724
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,949
- No, but couldn't I just tell her...?
- Tell her nothing.

725
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,671
The less anyone knows, the better.
Air-tight security. No holes anywhere.

726
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,789
Thank you.

727
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,792
- Everybody decent?
- If you call this "decent"...

728
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,949
Come in.

729
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

730
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,958
- What's the matter? Bad news?
- No.

731
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,154
- Good news.
- That's why you are laughing?

732
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,758
- I've been taken off your brother's case.
- This is good news?

733
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,110
For you and me. That's off too.

734
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,236
You mean
we're not engaged anymore?

735
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,471
It's no longer necessary.

736
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,911
- Nothing like freedom, I always say.
- So do I.

737
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,472
I suppose you want the ring back.

738
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,959
I've been thinking about it.
Why don't you keep it?

739
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,069
Keep it?

740
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,715
- Do you think I am a gold digger?
- No, I didn't mean...

741
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,509
You break our engagement
and try to give me an expensive ring.

742
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,797
- What am I to think?
- I don't mean I want to break it off.

743
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,236
- I was just trying...
- I knowwhat you're trying.

744
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,592
- Anyway, it's still stuck.
- Have you tried soap?

745
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,310
Soap? Is that what you used
on the others, Doctor?

746
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,710
- What others?
- "What others"?

747
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,556
One, two, three,
four, five, six fiancées.

748
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,270
You have a great deal in common
with a yo-yo.

749
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,193
- That's not fair. This is different.
- How is it different?

750
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,474
- Well...
- Here, pull.

751
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,311
- Take it easy. You'll get your ring back.
- I don't want it back.

752
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,272
It doesn't matter what you want.

753
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,995
You'll get one engagement ring.
You'll get it if you have to amputate...

754
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,999
- I hope it fits her better than me.
- Who?

755
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,039
- The new one, number eight.
- There is no number eight.

756
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,834
- Ha!
- What do you mean "Ha"?

757
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,592
- Just "Ha".
- Look.

758
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,038
There is no number eight.
They may never be a number eight.

759
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,277
And as far as I'm concerned,
there was no number seven, either.

760
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,712
- Good night, Miss Vincenti.
- Good night, Dr. Snow. And goodbye!

761
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,437
Nowyou tell me.

762
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,916
I think that's all, Dr. Burford.
It's time we left for the airport.

763
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,277
And remember, not a word to anyone.

764
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,592
Our security must be perfect,
a work of art.

765
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,595
Right, George.
I won't open my mouth.

766
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,277
Have you ever considered
of consulting a colleague?

767
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,351
I mean like having your head examined?

768
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,998
I agree with you, but there isn't
a damned thing I can do about it.

769
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,917
Dr. Snow's office.

770
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,789
Yes, he's here.

771
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,999
It's Dr. Burford.

772
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,789
Hello, Bob.

773
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,309
What?

774
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,989
Where?

775
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,634
I'll be right over.

776
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,591
You told me this business
was hush-hush.

777
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,470
I thought the General would want to know
why I didn't make it last night.

778
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,433
- Someone slugged you?
- No, nothing like that.

779
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,876
I slipped on a wet patch
coming out of my apartment house.

780
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,310
Couple of fellows helped me
and called an ambulance.

781
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,389
Did you knowthese fellas?

782
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,759
Never sawthem before.
I thought, in case the General called you...

783
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,869
He didn't.

784
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,478
- Maybe this wasn't an accident.
- What do you mean?

785
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,313
Were you carrying any papers?
Identification of any kind?

786
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,038
In my wallet, in my coat...

787
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,435
No wallet?

788
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,993
These fellas that helped you,
can you describe them?

789
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,358
I was pretty well out.

790
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,078
Ordinary fellows.

791
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,029
Dark suits. Well dressed.
Those hats, you know.

792
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,710
- Homburgs?
- Yes.

793
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,597
Not registered? Are you sure?

794
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,038
This is Mr. Nelson of FBI.

795
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,229
I see.

796
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,313
No, thank you.

797
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,718
The hotel has no record of any Mr. Barker.

798
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,189
Of course. When they riffed me,
they broke my contact.

799
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,474
Mr. Nelson,
I am not suffering from hallucinations.

800
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,228
You knowwho I am?

801
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,949
I do have some reputation
in my profession.

802
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,031
Yes, we knowwho you are.

803
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,113
- We're trying to check out your story.
- But there isn't time.

804
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,952
They wanted Dr. Burford's papers
so one of them could take this place.

805
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,589
They've probably
penetrated Base X by now.

806
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,719
And you have no clue
as to where this Base X is located?

807
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,115
I tell you I was blindfolded!

808
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:37,035
You're the FBI. Can't you
pick up the phone and call the NSA?

809
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,999
You've to get through to General Pratt
if he's still alive.

810
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,033
Or Mr. Barker or somebody!
You've got to find Base X!

811
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,876
Dr. Snow, on security matters,
even the FBI must go through channels

812
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,798
and with the proper authorization.

813
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,635
- I repeat, I'll check out your...
- Don't bother.

814
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,957
I'm beginning to think
even the FBI can't break through

815
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,509
this rubber curtain you call "security".

816
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,034
I'll find Base X.

817
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,592
You sit there and check out my story,
but I'll find Base X.

818
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,516
I've got it all up here,
in my subconscious.

819
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,838
Get me the Federal Aviation.
What's the matter with you?

820
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,312
Good afternoon, Dr. Snow.

821
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,313
Good afternoon, Mr...

822
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,519
Detective Second Grade Harrigan.
132nd Precinct.

823
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,114
Oh, yes.

824
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,714
The Lieutenant
wants to ask you some questions.

825
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,713
Like why Arthur Vincenti's landlady
says he didn't go on no fishing trip?

826
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,999
Where you been spending your evenings,
staying out until 3 or 4 am?

827
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,117
Don't tell me you're reviving
that ridiculous kidnapping charge.

828
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,437
Do you come quietly or

829
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,753
do I have to pull you in?

830
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,471
Do you mind if I change clothes first?

831
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,836
- No. We got all day.
- Maybe you have, but I haven't.

832
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,593
So this is where it all happens, huh?
The yak-kity-yak?

833
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,950
No, in there.

834
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,239
The couch, huh?

835
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,598
Imagine just Iying here and busting off
your trap to some perfect stranger.

836
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,915
Not me!

837
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,955
Why not you?
We all suffer from feelings of inadequacy.

838
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,709
To some extent.

839
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,277
That's for the birds, Doc.
I got no complaints.

840
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,996
Then why do you make a point
of referring to yourself

841
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,991
as Detective Second Grade Harrigan?

842
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,118
So I been stuck in Second Rate for 6 years.
You wanna know why?

843
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,270
That's easy.
Because you're such a stupid...

844
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,999
- Get the clothes, quick.
- Yes.

845
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,758
Let me guess...

846
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,836
You're the victim of a conspiracy.

847
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,468
How did you know?

848
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,358
Why don't you tell me about it?

849
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,670
I had a happy, normal
American childhood.

850
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,150
My old man used to beat me up
when he got a loan on.

851
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,356
You should've seen my old man.
He had a hand like a catcher's mitt.

852
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,073
Those were the days.

853
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,670
Putting the arm on the kids in school,
then putting the arm on me.

854
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,273
But I was the biggest

855
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,876
and pretty soon nobody
got to put the arm on me.

856
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,310
So I decided to go on the cops.

857
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,709
You thing I made the right decision?

858
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,029
Doc?

859
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,589
Doc!

860
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,869
Doc!

861
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,679
Looking for someone?

862
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,233
Is your niece at home?

863
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,197
- Well, she is and she isn't.
- What?

864
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,072
The answer is no!

865
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,550
Dr. Snow, don't pay attention to her.

866
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,389
Move over.

867
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,951
- Who is that at the door?
- Nobody.

868
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,390
What a nice surprise!
Would you stay for supper? Risotto tonight.

869
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,189
- No, thanks, I just want to talk to Vicky.
- A lovers' quarrel, huh?

870
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,390
- You've come to kiss and make up.
- That's right.

871
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,552
I will not kiss and make up.
I'm not at home to Dr. Snow!

872
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,790
Please, I just want to talk to you.

873
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,756
- The human comedy always fascinates me.
- Listen.

874
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,318
Stand by the window.
The police are after me.

875
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,474
- On the level? What's the beef?
- Kidnapping.

876
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,314
Kidnapping, Miss Vincenti,
remember?

877
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,150
I hope they give you life.
I hope they give you the hot sit!

878
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,679
- Seat.
- Seat.

879
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,035
Miss Vincenti.

880
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,439
Vicky...
Will you listen to me, please?

881
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,392
They've found Base X.

882
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,269
Now, help me.

883
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,233
How do I know he's a crook?
He don't like no crook.

884
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,157
He flags me down.
I take him where he wants to go.

885
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,719
What's that make me, stupid?

886
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,678
The trouble with you is
you suffer from feelings of inadequacy,

887
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,239
so shut up and drive.

888
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,553
All right, thank you.

889
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,798
The FAA has no record
of any such flight plan.

890
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,913
But we have the average time
and the cruising speed of that plane.

891
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,274
Base X is somewhere
along that arc.

892
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,070
It's a start, anyway.
We've eliminated 44 states.

893
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,760
You forgot Alaska and Hawaii.

894
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,834
I think we've picked up
a little fuzz.

895
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,392
- I'll bet that's your friend Harrigan.
- It was a mistake.

896
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,873
You don't know him.

897
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,989
Hey!

898
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,549
Hey, Doc!

899
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,595
Back door.

900
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,996
- All made up? Friends again?
- Yes.

901
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,237
- You'll stay for supper.
- No, I'm very sorry.

902
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,674
We have an appointment.

903
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,036
Mario, please, answer the door.

904
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,036
Open up!
In the name of the law!

905
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,154
- Come on, hurry up.
- I'm caught!

906
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,752
Take it up with the Commissioner!

907
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,593
- Can I help you, sir?
- Out of my way, Small Fry.

908
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,511
The boy didn't do anything.

909
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,749
Doc!

910
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,948
Your pants!

911
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,552
You're under arrest, Doc!

912
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,949
Papa?

913
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,675
- And nowwhat?
- I don't know. Head south. Ask questions.

914
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,149
How do we get out of New York
with the police after us?

915
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,833
Why do you make
so many difficulties?

916
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,876
- I make difficulties?
- Wait.

917
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,635
What's the matter?

918
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,909
Those people, that party...

919
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,390
- What people?
- Those!

920
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,311
Those are geese.

921
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,238
- Geese?
- Geese.

922
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,549
Geese!

923
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,909
Geese, yeah, geese.

924
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,758
Pillars of the avian community.
Intelligent, hardy, resourceful...

925
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,752
Is it true that they follow definite flyways,
from north to south?

926
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,909
And vice versa.

927
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:12,153
Could you trace the point
where the flyway intersects with this arc?

928
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,033
I think so.
The Atlantic Flyway.

929
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,232
Yes, how often I've followed it...

930
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,790
It will intersect your arc here,

931
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,954
in Chattawottamie County,
the goose capital of America.

932
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,316
- Chatta... where?
- Chattawottamie County.

933
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,233
Chatta-wottamie County.

934
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,754
- Check the real estate agents?
- Real estate agents?

935
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,037
Yes, whatever you say.
But, may I ask why?

936
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,878
Because I'm trying to find a house.

937
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,560
If anyone knows houses in a district,

938
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,070
it's the real estate agents and get
a phone book for Chattawottamie County.

939
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,038
Meet me at the King Arthur Hotel
at the telephones.

940
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,109
Roger.

941
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,674
I think you should know
you're on the radio.

942
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,469
- Kidnapping. Also assaulting an Officer.
- Yes, I know.

943
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,438
Just as long as you know.

944
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,919
It's a Colonial house,
probably pre Civil War.

945
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,356
- It's approached by a plank bridge...
- It's on an island in a swamp...

946
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,237
Then there's a circular driveway.

947
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,189
The living room has a large red chandelier
and red willowwall paper.

948
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,794
But are you sure?
Thank you.

949
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,030
Are you sure
there's no such house?

950
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,669
- I want number 3-7-6...
- I see, thank you.

951
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,629
Hello? Hello?

952
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,755
Yep, this here's him.

953
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,675
- Big living room, a great grand glass...
- Operator, code number 3-7-6.

954
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:39,675
- Number 6-2-2-8-7-8-1.
- ...and it has a circular driveway.

955
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,189
You have?

956
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,638
Bingo, Doctor!
I think I've got it!

957
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,469
Just a minute, I'll put my boss on.
Mr. Yancey, of Turkey Crossing.

958
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,749
- Hello, Mister...
- Yancey.

959
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,674
Yancey?
I'm most anxious to see that house.

960
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,599
We're driving now,
we'll be there sometime tomorrow.

961
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,869
You'll be there?

962
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,469
Of course.

963
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,910
- Mr. Oz Yancey.
- Yes, thank you.

964
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,672
- Good luck.
- Oh, yeah.

965
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,390
- Where to?
- Jersey, where else?

966
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,436
- What's in the back?
- Dummies.

967
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,230
- A wiseguy, huh?
- No, no, no.

968
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:27,148
You think that...
No, my cargo is undie dummies.

969
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,471
I am Michelangelo Vincenti.

970
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,558
- And I am Leonardo Liebowitz.
- How do you do?

971
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,912
Okay, wiseguy.

972
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,032
Go ahead. Come on.

973
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,395
- I beg your pardon, Miss Vincenti.
- Don't mention it, Dr. Snow.

974
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,200
- I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right.

975
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,910
Miss Vincenti,
I've been thinking...

976
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,710
- This matter of our engagement...?
- Please, Dr. Snow.

977
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,274
I'm only here because of my brother.

978
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,193
Our relationship is strictly business.

979
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,838
Yes, Miss Vincenti.

980
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,954
It's all yours.
I'll take the ferry back. Ciao.

981
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,554
- Good luck, Doctor.
- Ciao.

982
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,069
Buona fortuna.

983
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,316
Seven miles to Turkey Crossing.

984
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,475
Mr. Yancey?

985
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,309
Yancey.

986
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,589
Dead?

987
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,548
- Drunk.
- I'll make some coffee.

988
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,434
Mr. Yancey.

989
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,157
It will take hours
to bring him around.

990
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,229
Come on!

991
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,753
Look, someone made a little fire there.

992
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,958
The flare path.
This is where we landed.

993
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,918
- We've found it!
- We've found a place to start.

994
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,955
If the plane landed this way,
we went out...

995
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,789
that way.

996
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,355
- But I was blindfolded.
- My scarf.

997
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,557
- I'll drive.
- Good.

998
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,509
Go ahead.

999
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:13,796
If we're on the right road
we should cross that bridge soon.

1000
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,398
One bridge coming up.

1001
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,229
Now...

1002
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,391
Look for a road on the right.

1003
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:48,037
Somewhere along here I heard singing...
like choir practice.

1004
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,118
There's a church on our right.

1005
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,879
Then, take the next left.

1006
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,951
- Which?
- What do you mean, which?

1007
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,069
Have a look.

1008
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,069
This way.

1009
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,429
That way!

1010
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,432
This time three of them.

1011
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,275
Take that one down
toward the water.

1012
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,677
- You said towards the water.
- I didn't say into it.

1013
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,437
Let's see if we can
get this thing out of here.

1014
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,869
Balordo...

1015
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,509
Come on.

1016
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,469
Are you all right?

1017
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,389
Look, Doctor.

1018
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,355
Hey, son.

1019
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,993
Do you know of a big old house
around here on the water?

1020
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,592
There's one over yonder.

1021
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,756
- How can we get to that house?
- Round by the other road.

1022
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,789
We'd better stay of the road
from now on.

1023
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,359
Can we cut straight across?

1024
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,469
On foot? That swamp's
full of snakes and gators.

1025
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,152
- Will you sell me that mule?
- He's Puppy's mule.

1026
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,955
Suppose I promise to return the mule
and give your Pappy five dollars?

1027
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,391
- Where do I leave it?
- Leave him loose. He come on home.

1028
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,239
- What's his name?
- Hinry.

1029
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,189
Hinry?

1030
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,799
Son, give me a hand.

1031
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,754
You sure ain't done much riding, Mister.

1032
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,432
Hinry is cross-wired.

1033
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,039
You want him to proceed,
you hold him back. He stop.

1034
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,474
Anything else I should know?
Any other fine points of mulesmanship?

1035
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:12,910
Yes, don't never tech Hinry's tail.
He's kinda sensitive back there.

1036
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:17,437
I won't.
Hinry's tail shall be inviolate...

1037
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,349
Thank you, son.

1038
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,069
Whoa, Hinry.

1039
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,589
See anything?

1040
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,953
Naw, a couple local peasants on a mule.

1041
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,556
- Any sign of the cruiser?
- Not yet.

1042
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,152
Proceed, Hinry.

1043
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,149
Whoa, Hinry.

1044
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,109
Whoa, Hinry!

1045
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,718
There's nothing more stupid and ornery
than a stupid and ornery mule!

1046
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,109
Quicksand...

1047
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,835
- Miss Vincenti, please!
- ¡Avanti, avanti!

1048
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,790
Avanti, Hinry, please!

1049
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,516
I guess there's something more stupid
than a stupid mule.

1050
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,077
Hinry, my apologies.

1051
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,075
We'll never get the mule across all that.

1052
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,029
Come on, honey.

1053
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,111
Tie him up and we'll pick him up
to the way back.

1054
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,116
- So long, Hinry.
- No!

1055
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,635
What happened?

1056
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,108
You were warned, remember?
You teched Hinry's tail.

1057
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,474
No the way he teched mine!

1058
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,509
Listen.

1059
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,595
That sound...

1060
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,799
- I heard it before.
- By the swamp... over there.

1061
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,590
Base to Air boat.

1062
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:51,508
- What are you doing? Do you see something?
- No, just alligators.

1063
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,874
Mamma mia.

1064
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,469
- Please, this is not time...
- Look!

1065
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,989
Captain, no!

1066
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,556
- Doctor...
- Captain.

1067
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,271
Am I glad to see you!

1068
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,354
And the General?

1069
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,158
- He was hit, but I think he's still alive.
- Are you sure my brother's all right?

1070
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,316
- Of course, Miss Vincenti.
- They wouldn't hurt him.

1071
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,109
How many men does Fitzpatrick
have on the island?

1072
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:18,273
Seemed like a hundred when they jumped us,
but I suppose ten or fifteen besides himself.

1073
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,672
We'll have to go back and get help.

1074
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,520
- Reinforcements?
- Worse than that.

1075
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,394
They're getting ready to move out.
Probably to a ship waiting outside.

1076
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:50,438
I'm sorry,
Arturo gets terribly seasick.

1077
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,429
That settles it.
No time to go for help.

1078
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,229
Captain.

1079
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,591
Can you operate that air boat?

1080
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,078
Yes I can!

1081
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,038
Hey! You!

1082
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,029
Let's go!

1083
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,149
No!

1084
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,869
Help!

1085
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,520
Base to Air Boat.
Base to Air boat.

1086
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,074
Base to Air boat.

1087
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,439
Base to Air boat.

1088
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,717
- ¿Yeah?
- Did you see something?

1089
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,473
- No, just alligators.
- Fuh... Fuh... Fuh...

1090
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,875
Fitzpatrick is annoyed.
Come on.

1091
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,036
Let's go in right here.
Hurry!

1092
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,233
Finish up, we're leaving.

1093
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,312
- Get them ready.
- Him too?

1094
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,515
Of course.

1095
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,194
You'll make a nice dividend
for my clients, General.

1096
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,790
A highly profitable deal.

1097
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,875
Hey, buddy.

1098
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,435
What kept you?

1099
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,394
- Got a match?
- I don't smoke.

1100
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,669
- Here are matches.
- Fine.

1101
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,953
This way. The cellar door.

1102
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,269
You come with me.
You stay here and watch them.

1103
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,394
It's the cruiser!

1104
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:43,749
Now.

1105
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,229
Vicky!

1106
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:58,835
Good girl.

1107
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,114
- You better give me that, Doc.
- Come on.

1108
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,038
- Who?
- Dr. Snow and that girl.

1109
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:11,391
- Snow...
- Come on up to the house, move!

1110
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,309
Dr. Snow.

1111
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,315
I know you're there, Dr. Snow.

1112
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:27,709
It's empty.

1113
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,711
We better get out of here
before they surround the house.

1114
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,673
I'll try to keep him talking.
All paranoids love to talk.

1115
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,598
- You heard the doctor.
- Go on!

1116
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:36,949
Dr. Snow!

1117
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,679
Dr. Snow!

1118
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,114
Fitzpatrick.

1119
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,473
Listen to me.

1120
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,358
All right, Dr. Snow.

1121
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,269
I'm listening.

1122
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,431
You're a businessman.
The General and I'll make a deal with you.

1123
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,469
Why should I make a deal?
You have nothing I'm interested in buying.

1124
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,715
- You have no assets, Doctor.
- We have a few...

1125
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,511
You've lost your transportation.

1126
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,513
Before you can even send for another boat,
help will be here.

1127
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,272
I don't buy it.

1128
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,478
If help were on the way, you and the girl
wouldn't have come in here alone.

1129
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,476
- Don't you think I called the Army first?
- Of course you did.

1130
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,679
And you couldn't find anyone authorized
to tell you anything...

1131
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,159
Or even to listen to you.

1132
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:33,637
Because General's security is so airtight
that nobody knows what he's doing.

1133
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,279
Am I right, General?

1134
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,389
You mean you planned it all this way?
That was very clever of you.

1135
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,951
I've made a fool of the General from the start.
I made his habits part of my plans.

1136
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:50,155
My whole operation depended on the General
behaving how I predicted he'd behave.

1137
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,753
And I keep the same sort of book

1138
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,311
on every major security officer
in every civilized nation in this world.

1139
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,956
I'm the world's greatest authority
on security techniques.

1140
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,872
That's my business.

1141
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:06,239
Now, do you come out
or do we come in and get you?

1142
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,069
There he is!

1143
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,638
Get the cars. Block the roads.
They can't get far.

1144
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,638
Spread out!
Get around them!

1145
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,430
Come on, let's go!

1146
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,717
Leave me alone. I've had it.
You three make a run for it.

1147
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,029
Wait.

1148
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,752
Brought some transportation.
His name is Hinry.

1149
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,155
Biggest mistake the Army ever made,
mustering out the old mules.

1150
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,399
- Come on, giddap, Hinry.
- No, wrong code. Whoa, Hinry.

1151
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:41,349
Hurry up!

1152
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,349
This way.

1153
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,439
Whoa, Hinry.

1154
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,229
Don't shoot!

1155
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,873
All right, Dr. Snow.

1156
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,269
Let's go!

1157
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,229
Hey! There are ours!

1158
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,199
That's it, men.
Go get them!

1159
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,028
Go and get them!
That way, that way!

1160
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,596
All right, get me out of here!

1161
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,919
That's it, Mammoths!

1162
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,434
All right, Dr. Snow.

1163
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,873
You win,
but you can't take it with you.

1164
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,592
Doctor, doc...

1165
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,915
- General!
- Barker!

1166
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,389
It's good to see you all.

1167
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,236
Wait a minute.
How'd you know where to find me?

1168
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,952
- Well, we got a good...
- There's a leak in security?

1169
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,758
- From the FBI.
- Heads are gonna roll for this.

1170
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:51,434
- Well, Dr. Snow...
- Never mind about Dr. Snow.

1171
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:55,316
Dr. Snow?
How did he know where to find me?

1172
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,917
Dr. Snow? Dr. Snow?

1173
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,912
Put the lights over there.

1174
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,599
Security, huh?
