1
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,468
<i>I don't feel anything.</i>
<i>It's graduation.</i>

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:23,263
<i>Mr. Carroll ridicules me all</i>
<i>year. Then he writes in my yearbook:</i>

3
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,233
<i>"You're a live wire.</i>
<i>Love, Mr. Carroll. "</i>

4
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,441
<i>He wants to go on good terms.</i>

5
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:33,690
When he uses "love,"
I look for a new word.

6
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:36,576
Lloyd, she's being difficult.

7
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:39,572
- I'm taking out Diane Court.
- Not likely.

8
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,786
- Is the movies a good second date?
- You never had a first.

9
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,251
I sat across from her in a mall.
We ate.

10
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:51,755
- Sharing an important physical event.
- That's not even a scam.

11
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:54,089
- A scam?
- Going out as friends.

12
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,671
- No, scam is lusting.
- Then what's a date?

13
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:02,217
A date is prearrangement
with a possibility for love.

14
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:04,723
Then what's love?

15
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,395
I'm gonna call her.

16
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:09,891
She doesn't date guys like you.
She's a brain.

17
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,895
With the body of a game-show hostess.

18
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,353
She doesn't know she's pretty.

19
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:19,736
- That's what's cool about her.
- Brains stay with brains.

20
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:23,783
If a bomb goes off,
their genes form the same cliques.

21
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:26,868
- I wouldn't get my hopes up.
- I'm sorry.

22
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:31,412
You're a really nice guy.
We don't wanna see you get hurt.

23
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:34,335
I wanna get hurt!

24
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:47,472
"It's almost over. We've gone
to school together for three years."

25
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:53,315
- I might cut that part.
- Why? That's fine. It's nice.

26
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:34,015
"Having taken courses at the
university, I've glimpsed our future.

27
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,470
And all I can say is:

28
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,392
'Go back.'"

29
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,561
"Go back"? What a great line.

30
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,489
- You like it?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:50,655
- I didn't think anyone would get it.
- No, it's wonderful. It's...

32
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:54,204
No, don't worry about it.
You're very funny.

33
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:58,783
- "Go back." That's great.
- No more. I'm gonna save it.

34
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,703
<i>I decided long ago</i>

35
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:06,422
<i>Never to walk in anyone's shadow</i>

36
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:09,126
<i>If I fail</i>
<i>If I succeed</i>

37
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:12,140
<i>At least I live as I believe</i>

38
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:15,515
<i>No matter what they take from me</i>

39
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:19,267
<i>They can't take away my dignity</i>

40
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,314
<i>Because the greatest love of all</i>

41
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,816
<i>Is happening to me</i>

42
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:34,657
<i>I found the greatest</i>

43
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,033
<i>Love of all inside of me</i>

44
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,369
I love you guys!

45
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,583
Thanks, pal.

46
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:51,795
Party at Vahlere's.
Gonna be eight kegs. Be there.

47
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,636
Thank you, Joe.

48
00:03:58,101 --> 00:03:59,132
Thank you.

49
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:03,392
And now it's time.

50
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:08,896
I just can't introduce this person
without saying, "History...

51
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:12,562
...oceanography, creative writing...

52
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:18,361
...biochemistry. " I think
you know who I'm talking about.

53
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,365
We'll remember this student who said:

54
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,865
"Hey, worid. Check me out!"

55
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:30,580
Giving a speech entitled
"Soaring Ahead"...

56
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:34,507
...Miss Diane Court.

57
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,394
Thank you.

58
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,774
The real worid.

59
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,520
Look at those eyes.

60
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:57,437
We're all about to enter
the real worid.

61
00:04:57,823 --> 00:05:00,148
That's what everybody says.

62
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:04,953
But most of us have been
in the real worid a long time.

63
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:09,750
But I've something to tell everybody.

64
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:15,039
I've glimpsed our future
and all I can say is:

65
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:16,371
"Go back."

66
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:24,758
Well...

67
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,097
...it's almost over.

68
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,388
We've gone to school together
for three years...

69
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:34,804
...and we've been through a lot.

70
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:38,940
But with that training net
of high school gone...

71
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:43,530
...what's gonna happen to us?
We all know what the answers are.

72
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:48,947
We wanna be happy, go to college,
work hard, maybe raise a family.

73
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:55,376
But what if that doesn't happen?
I have to be honest, though.

74
00:05:55,586 --> 00:06:00,828
I have all the hope
and ambition in the worid.

75
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:04,585
But when I think about the future...

76
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:07,922
...the truth is...

77
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:10,467
...I am...

78
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,135
...really...

79
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:16,223
...scared.

80
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,641
All right. Get up on it.
Yay! All right.

81
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,685
- See you at home.
- Okay.

82
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:25,436
Do yourself and everyone
who loves you a favor.

83
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:28,188
- Don't talk to Joe.
- Mom...

84
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,443
Stop, okay?

85
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:33,150
- Bye.
- See you later, Mrs. Flood.

86
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,786
- Look at those eyes.
- Give it up.

87
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:40,534
- Take a picture of me with her.
- Lloyd.

88
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:43,623
- That's just embarrassing.
- Please?

89
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:47,757
- All right, okay.
- Do it.

90
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:55,135
- Wait till I get around to her.
- All right, man. I got it.

91
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,134
Your graduation present
is parked right over there.

92
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,557
Are you kidding? That?!

93
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:08,609
- Lloyd?
- Hey, sis!

94
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:12,404
I'm sorry. I had a new crown,
three root canals...

95
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:17,824
...and Jason has a sore throat.
Your graduation and no one was there.

96
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,828
I called Mom and Dad,
and it's like they were there.

97
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,327
- I hope you understand.
- Hey. Bad throat, huh, J-man?

98
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,578
Yeah.

99
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:30,082
He's not at full "Yeah!" strength.

100
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,793
Poor little man.

101
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,134
Why do you eat that stuff?
There's no food in your food.

102
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:45,350
- Too loud. The red line has a purpose.
- How do you know how to draw it?

103
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:49,347
It's loud enough,
and the neighbors don't complain.

104
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,399
Good thing there's not
a red line on you. Yeah!

105
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:55,237
- Yeah!
- He's back!

106
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:58,948
My brother, can I borrow
your <i>Hey, Soul Classics</i>?

107
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,995
My brother, you gotta go buy your own.

108
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:06,784
- Hook it off the jab.
- Can't you be an uncle, not a playmate?

109
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:14,124
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

110
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,254
Get in a good mood. How hard is it
to decide to be in a good mood...

111
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,719
...and then be in a good mood?
- Gee, it's easy.

112
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:35,185
I'm sorry Mom and Dad
made you take me in.

113
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:39,105
If it's a big deal, I'll go.
But you used to be fun.

114
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:42,277
You were warped, twisted
and hilarious.

115
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:44,949
I mean it as a compliment.

116
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,036
I mean, I'm sorry...

117
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:50,583
...that T-l-M left you.

118
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,746
But I am not T-l-M.

119
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:06,218
- I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
- Yeah.

120
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:09,350
I still am.

121
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:15,230
- You gotta teach me stick shift.
Promise.

122
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,983
Come here a minute.
I want to show you something.

123
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,615
What are you doing?

124
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:27,909
Since I'm both your father
and your friend...

125
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,163
...I had to get you two presents.
- God, this is ridiculous.

126
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:36,122
Here's the only thing
your mom gave me that I kept.

127
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:37,913
Now it's yours.

128
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,456
Go ahead. Open it now.

129
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:46,668
I don't need all these presents.
I don't know any kid who got a car.

130
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:48,761
Oh, God.

131
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,509
Wow, it's beautiful.

132
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:57,722
They really applauded
for you today, honey.

133
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:05,025
Looking at all the people,
I felt like they didn't know me.

134
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:11,076
Maybe I shouldn't have taken
all those courses off school...

135
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,826
...because everybody thinks I...

136
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,948
- Forget it.
- Wait a minute.

137
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:21,743
- Everybody thinks you're what?
- Everybody thinks I'm a priss.

138
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:27,172
Diane, in a million years,
you could never be a priss.

139
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:32,634
It's all working out for you, honey.
Do you see?

140
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,598
It's working out just like we planned.

141
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:39,427
All the summer schools,
the vacations you gave up...

142
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:41,933
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

143
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:47,568
Sorry.

144
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,534
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, honey.

145
00:11:06,962 --> 00:11:09,253
Come on, come on, come on.

146
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,458
Yah! Yah!

147
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,758
Diane Court!

148
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,350
Suck it.

149
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,635
Come on. Get the bag.

150
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:27,727
An exciting kick.
My brother. Let's go.

151
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:31,889
Yah! Yah! Yah!

152
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,149
You're headed for daycare, buddy.

153
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:40,317
- Be tough, J-man.
- He's a mess!

154
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:43,243
I'll be in my office.

155
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,575
- I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
- Yeah!

156
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:51,584
Please, not in my ear. Not in my ear.

157
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,480
<i>Jim Court.</i>
- Hello. May I please speak with Diane?

158
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,061
- Sorry, Diane isn't in at the moment.
- Oh, okay.

159
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,947
<i>- This the guy with the Mustang?</i>
- No.

160
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,192
- Guy with the Datsun?
- No.

161
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,026
- The truck?
- No, not really.

162
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,538
You don't know me.
I'm a friend of Diane's.

163
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:34,493
I sat with her yesterday at a mall.
I drive a blue Chevy Malibu.

164
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:38,578
I'm pretty bad at this,
but what I want to do is, can I...?

165
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,464
<i>Give me your number.</i>
<i>That's usually how it works.</i>

166
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,094
Okay. Lloyd Dobler. 555-1342.

167
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,806
It's 555-1342.

168
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,186
<i>- 555- 1342.</i>
- Okay, I'll get her the message.

169
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,067
- She's pretty great, isn't she?
<i>- What?</i>

170
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:02,938
- She's really pretty great, isn't she?
- She is. Good luck, kid.

171
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:06,238
Good afternoon. Okay, bye.

172
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,621
Jim Court.

173
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:24,171
No, this is her father. Can I take...?

174
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:28,344
What?

175
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:32,511
No, I didn't get the letter.

176
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:34,882
Yes!

177
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,558
Yes, right away.

178
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,265
Yeah, thank you. Goodbye.

179
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:50,358
<i>Ricky, don't lose that number</i>

180
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,196
<i>Don't call nobody else</i>

181
00:13:56,831 --> 00:14:01,291
<i>Send it off in a letter</i>
<i>To yourself</i>

182
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:06,918
<i>Ricky, don't lose that number</i>

183
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:16,137
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
You're a vision in green.

184
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:21,390
I'll mail this for you. You can trust
a man who writes a letter daily.

185
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:25,269
- Diane here? I gotta talk to her.
- She's upstairs.

186
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:29,769
I gotta tell you this carefully.
Would you mind?

187
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,027
- Just a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,073
Great. It won't be long. Thanks.

189
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,034
What?

190
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,283
- I had a phone call.
- Tell me.

191
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,542
- Is it bad news?
- Just listen.

192
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,330
You won the Reed Fellowship.

193
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,507
Are you kidding?

194
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,086
You're not kidding?
You're not kidding!

195
00:14:57,347 --> 00:15:00,596
You'll study at
the finest institute in England.

196
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,643
- The toughest fellowship in England.
- I won?

197
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:08,064
You're gonna take a big step.
I want one thing from you.

198
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,773
You stand up straight.
Admit you're special.

199
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:17,231
- God. I'll have to go on a plane.
- Worry about that later.

200
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:21,030
Now, come on.
Tell me that you're special.

201
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:23,948
You're too good at making me nervous.

202
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:28,540
Listen! You're the best
in the country, don't you understand?

203
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,918
It's like a pyramid.
It starts with everyone...

204
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,750
...and it narrows through your life.

205
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:38,962
The competition narrows it down
to one brilliant person...

206
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:43,886
...who is so special they celebrate
you on two continents. It's you.

207
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:48,257
So tell me something.
Where's the flaw in that?

208
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:53,061
There is no flaw.

209
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:09,152
Hello?

210
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:13,074
Yeah, just a second, Corey.

211
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,079
Oh, sorry.

212
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:18,004
Diane Court.

213
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:22,876
- Don't go in there.
- Forget it. It's mine!

214
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,170
It's too bad.

215
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:32,053
No noise, no sound,
no movement, nothing.

216
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,306
Hello. Diane?

217
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,645
Hi. You called me?

218
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:43,319
I read about your fellowship,
and I'm glad you called me back.

219
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,199
I just wanted to congratulate you...

220
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:50,322
...and tell you I thought
your speech was incredible.

221
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:55,279
- Thank you very much.
- Whoa, what a day, huh?

222
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:58,335
<i>Yeah. What a day.</i>

223
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:00,453
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

224
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:05,037
- Do you know who I am?
<i>- We sat together at Bell Square.</i>

225
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,958
- You remember.
- No, I read it on the message.

226
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,014
Okay, so it's Lloyd and let's go out.

227
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:18,227
<i>- You wanna go out?</i>
- Thanks, but I'm busy.

228
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:24,599
- Busy.
<i>- Things are pretty hectic, but thanks.</i>

229
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:28,567
- You busy on Friday?
- Yeah, I have to help my father.

230
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:33,158
- How about Saturday?
- I have things to do around the house.

231
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:39,203
So you're too monumentally busy?

232
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,866
Well, not monumentally.

233
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:46,920
What about tonight then?
You going to Vahlere's party?

234
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:52,422
You can't leave the country
without going to Vahlere's.

235
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:57,464
The gentleman is 22 and comes out
of hiding once a year for this...

236
00:17:57,684 --> 00:18:02,924
...dressed as the Lakeside Rooster.
He makes Purple Passion drinks...

237
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:06,349
- I think that...
- You're not in England yet.

238
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:09,139
I lived in England for three months.

239
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,780
My parents are in the Army,
so we lived in England and Germany.

240
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,564
I could give you many English tips.

241
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:22,742
- Well...
- I won't give any tips of any kind.

242
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:24,616
- I'll go.
- Pardon me?

243
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:27,372
- I'll go.
- You will?

244
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:30,494
Excellent. This is great.

245
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:32,955
- You will, really?
- I'll go.

246
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:38,465
We're going out. It's a date.
It's a scam. Whatever. All right.

247
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,254
- I'll pick you up at what, 8:00?
- Eight.

248
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,767
Eight o'clock.

249
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:47,187
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

250
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:55,936
Lloyd Dobler...

251
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,114
Thank you, little man.

252
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:07,494
Now work that bag, J-man.
Hook off the jab. Straight left hand.

253
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:10,413
- What do we love?
- Pain!

254
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:14,919
Work that jab! Work that hook!
Okay, take a break.

255
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:27,012
Be right there!

256
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,432
Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir.

257
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,477
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.

258
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:41,395
Heard about the graduation gift.
Really quite a car.

259
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,946
I know you're busy
so no need to entertain me.

260
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:49,288
You can trust me. I'm 19.
Was overseas for a few semesters.

261
00:19:49,497 --> 00:19:53,908
I rarely drink, as I kickbox.
It's the sport of the future.

262
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,994
Don Wilson? Benny Urquidez?
Your face says no.

263
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:03,503
Your daughter will be safe with me
for the next seven to eight hours.

264
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:05,753
Fine, Lloyd.

265
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:08,295
- Come in.
- Thank you.

266
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,135
- How you doing?
- I'm...

267
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,972
- Is she around?
- Honey?

268
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:22,849
Whoa.

269
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:25,819
Hi.

270
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,572
- Would you hold this for me?
- Yeah.

271
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,295
- What are these?
- Bavarian Dutch-style pretzels.

272
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,972
Um... Would it be terrible
if I wanted to go home early?

273
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,177
No.

274
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:14,942
You're not gonna believe this.

275
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:18,989
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

276
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,327
Hi, Lloyd.

277
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:24,577
You okay? Want a drink?

278
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:26,704
What's up, Lloyd?

279
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,835
- What's happening?
- What's up, man?

280
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:35,091
Hey, Dobler!
We are out of control!

281
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,589
That's not happening.

282
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:40,892
Now I gotta go to summer school.

283
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,811
How you doing?

284
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:52,858
- It's gotta stay purple all night.
- How you doing?

285
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,108
- You know Diane Court?
- Diane! Well...

286
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:59,527
- I need you to be the Keymaster.
- I was just...

287
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:03,030
He's very responsible. Thanks a lot.

288
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:07,868
- I was gonna move around. Thanks.
- "Keymaster"?

289
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:12,664
I gotta judge who can drive
and who can't, and keep their keys.

290
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:14,875
- So it's an honor.
- No.

291
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:20,005
- We finally graduated, big-dude guy!
- All right!

292
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,428
I'm so glad you came to this.

293
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:26,425
I've always wanted you
to come to one of these.

294
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,479
I wish you'd done that
without the keys!

295
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,306
- Come on. There are so many cute guys.
Let go of me!

296
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:36,776
- I love you, man!
- I love you too.

297
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:45,484
- Homeboy! Mike Cameron. How you doing?
- Hey.

298
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:50,331
- What?
- Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam.

299
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:54,748
I don't know you very well,
but I wanted to ask you...

300
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:58,339
...how you got Diane Court
to go out with you.

301
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,171
- I called her.
- But how come it worked?

302
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:04,755
- I mean, like, what are you?
- I'm Lloyd Dobler.

303
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:12,805
- Great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
- All right.

304
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:14,053
Key?

305
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:17,728
I wrote 63 songs
about Joe this year...

306
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:21,229
...and I'm gonna play
every one tonight.

307
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,945
I just saw Joe. He's here.

308
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:27,824
Don't be so dramatic about it.

309
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:31,618
You did try and kill yourself
because of the guy.

310
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:36,155
What was it like afterwards?
I've always wanted to know.

311
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:39,295
She explained it
in "Wake up, Seattle."

312
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:42,874
Stop. I am fine now. I am all right.

313
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:46,841
All everybody does is ask me
about this. I am fine.

314
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:49,759
Did Joe come with Mimi tonight?

315
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:53,928
Keys.

316
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,644
Keys, everybody.

317
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:59,347
- All right, Keymaster.
- Right.

318
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,358
- How you doing?
- Good.

319
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,105
I got you!
- How are you, Mrs. Evans?

320
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,320
You missed every
career counseling session.

321
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,986
Call me obsessive-compulsive,
but we must do this now.

322
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,653
- No way!
- Lloyd.

323
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,984
- What?
- You must...

324
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:14,947
- Get away!
- What did I do?

325
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:17,784
- Don't even follow me!
- Don't do this.

326
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,669
Don't make me sound like a counselor.

327
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,333
I've got statistics and graphs.

328
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,749
I got all this stuff
that say the same thing:

329
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,211
"You have to decide on a career."

330
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:35,089
My dad's an Army colonel.
He wants me to join.

331
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,513
There's no possible way.

332
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:41,061
Take a look at Seattle Junior College.

333
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:45,435
- You the Keymaster?
- I'm not gonna go there.

334
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,938
I'm looking for something bigger...

335
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,107
...a dare-to-be-great situation.

336
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:56,985
- Only your record is blank.
- Do people really know what they want?

337
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,153
Many think they have to know.
But inside, they don't.

338
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,458
I don't know.
But I know that I don't know.

339
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,292
Hang tough, Lloyd.

340
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:10,120
We were "ultra-competitive"...

341
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,385
...but I just want to say
if it wasn't for "Diane Court"...

342
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:20,015
...I wouldn't have gotten in Cornell.
You made me study twice as hard.

343
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:22,305
So thanks.

344
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,435
- You did the same for me.
- I did?

345
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:32,687
Did you really come here
with Lloyd Dobler?

346
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:38,401
- How did that "happen"?
- He made me laugh.

347
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,825
Yes.

348
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:47,372
He's okay, Dad.

349
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:51,952
You're welcome.
I always call you. You know that.

350
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:57,675
Stop being so grateful. All right.
I'll be home before dawn, okay?

351
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:00,086
- Bye.
- Dawn?

352
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:04,260
- Would you guys sign my annual?
- Sure.

353
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:08,224
- Would you sign mine?
- Did you have to call your dad?

354
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:11,687
- God, how nightmarish!
- I promised.

355
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,938
- Will he wait up?
- Say nothing.

356
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,938
I come in crying. He leaves me alone.

357
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:20,487
I loved your speech,
about being scared.

358
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,821
Lloyd Dobler. All right.

359
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:42,716
<i>He...</i>

360
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:47,092
<i>... likes giris...</i>

361
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:49,975
<i>... with names...</i>

362
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,850
<i>... like Ashley...</i>

363
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,933
<i>... and Tamerlane</i>

364
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,357
I'll be in the kitchen, Joe.

365
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:12,954
<i>That'll never be me</i>
<i>That'll never be me</i>

366
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,868
<i>That'll never be</i>
<i>Never be me, no!</i>

367
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,203
<i>That'll never be me</i>
<i>That'll never be me</i>

368
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:22,045
Joe. Joe.

369
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:24,589
<i>Sex, love...</i>

370
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,139
She's written 65 songs.
Sixty-five. They're all about you.

371
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:34,011
- They're all about pain.
- So, what's up?

372
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:37,511
So stop playing
with her mind, you know?

373
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:41,397
She's a human being.
She's very talented.

374
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,518
Why do you think I keep her tapes?
They're gonna be valuable someday.

375
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:47,769
<i>No</i>

376
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:49,609
<i>Never</i>

377
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:53,656
<i>No, never, ever, ever</i>
<i>Don't you ever think it</i>

378
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,408
Oh, my God.

379
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:18,391
Joe was my first love, my first sex,
and the whole time he was dating Mimi.

380
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:22,645
He'll never break up with her.
But if I see him, it's:

381
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:25,855
"Hi, Joe. How are you?"
And that is it.

382
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,940
I'll be okay.

383
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:31,986
Don't worry.
He's at the other end of the house.

384
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:35,234
It's too bad more guys
can't be like Lloyd.

385
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:39,610
He checks up on me. Look.

386
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:46,959
I got some more songs.

387
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,795
<i>Joe lies</i>

388
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,379
<i>Joe lies</i>

389
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:56,046
<i>Joe lies</i>

390
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,429
<i>When he cries</i>

391
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:04,217
<i>When he cries</i>

392
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:08,812
- So we can finally talk.
- Yeah.

393
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:11,147
Well... What?

394
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:17,024
<i>Lakewood, Lakewood, have no fear!</i>

395
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,490
<i>How about another year?</i>

396
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,868
- He does this every year?
- The worst job since Keymaster.

397
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:50,515
Hi, Joe. How are you?

398
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,106
I love you.

399
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,393
I love you too.

400
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,104
You invade my soul.

401
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:04,278
I wanna get back together.

402
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:10,612
Mimi's gonna go to college,
and I'm gonna be alone.

403
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:15,539
But I'm gonna break up with her
before she leaves.

404
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,178
Have sex with me.

405
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,553
Goodbye, Joe.

406
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:43,650
Every year I throw this party.
Every year nobody helps me clean up.

407
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:46,022
- Why am I yelling?
- I don't know.

408
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:48,068
- We're out of here.
- Thanks.

409
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:53,574
- Maybe we'll help you clean tomorrow.
- Diane, everyone loved that you came.

410
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,780
- You're a great rooster.
- Well...

411
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:57,659
- Sign this?
- Okay.

412
00:30:57,877 --> 00:30:58,991
Hey, Corey.

413
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:03,458
So I'm single now.
Everything's changed. I hate it.

414
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:09,546
- Give me my Firebird keys!
- You must chill!

415
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:11,839
You must chill!

416
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:15,011
I have hidden your keys! Chill!

417
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:19,270
- I love you!
- Love you too. Go to sleep.

418
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,315
- We're full-on buds.
- Yeah, all right.

419
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:32,151
You're a great person.

420
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:35,653
I'm a good person,
but you're a great person.

421
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,868
- We're out of there. See you tomorrow.
- See you. Bye.

422
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,124
- Bye, Diane.
- Bye.

423
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:45,663
Hey, drive safe.

424
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:47,828
Thank you.

425
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:51,334
I surrender my duties
as Keymaster. A beer.

426
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:53,385
Certainly.

427
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:57,421
I'm happy to say that this sack
is officially empty.

428
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,969
The back bathroom. Let's go.

429
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,444
- Look at this gentleman here.
I gotta get home.

430
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:20,077
I gotta get home.

431
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,657
Excuse me.

432
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,578
How you doing, brother?

433
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,462
I don't even know where we are.

434
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:37,173
<i>I'm gonna play three hours</i>
<i>of commercial-free rock...</i>

435
00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:40,920
- Oh, I love this album.
- This is a good one.

436
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:43,016
Like it?

437
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:54,480
Do you recognize anything yet?
Anything?

438
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,986
<i>Lord, have mercy.</i>

439
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,616
<i>Three hours of</i>
<i>commercial-free rock...</i>

440
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:05,318
That's my house! I live there.

441
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:10,376
Have a good sleep.

442
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:12,002
Bye.

443
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,498
Thanks a lot.

444
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:18,877
Hey, you guys are the best.
Give me a call or...

445
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,520
- Look at this one.
- Did you...?

446
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:43,069
So, what did they write
to Diane Court?

447
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:48,576
Listen to some of the things
they wrote me.

448
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:53,080
"Glad I finally met you.
You always seemed nice."

449
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,535
"Wish I'd known you more."

450
00:33:56,294 --> 00:34:00,376
Mine says stuff like,
"Lloyd, see you around, maybe."

451
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,051
- Nobody knew me before.
- They knew of you. Now they know you.

452
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:12,972
I feel like I fit in for
the first time, you know?

453
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:18,096
Like I just held them far away
from me, so they did the same to me.

454
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,274
That's cool then.

455
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:22,434
Yeah.

456
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:26,443
I'm so glad we did this.

457
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,161
We can walk from here.

458
00:34:34,997 --> 00:34:37,950
- It's just you and your dad?
- Long story.

459
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,837
- You don't wanna hear it.
- Sure, I do.

460
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,049
Well, my parents split up
when I was 13 and...

461
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:52,300
God, I actually had to go to court
and choose between the two of them.

462
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:57,721
So I chose my dad. Just felt
safer that way, you know?

463
00:34:57,936 --> 00:34:59,811
Watch out for that glass.

464
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:03,763
Thanks.

465
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:07,732
- But either way it's still...
- Twisted.

466
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:11,071
You know what? You're a great date.

467
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:15,110
I've never gone out
with someone so basic.

468
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:16,490
Basic?

469
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:22,787
- What's your job this summer?
- Being a great date.

470
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,158
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

471
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:28,463
I wanna see you as much as I can.
I said it!

472
00:35:28,674 --> 00:35:32,753
- I only have something like 16 weeks.
- That's a long time.

473
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:38,258
- Then call me tomorrow.
- Today is tomorrow.

474
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,724
- Then call me later.
- Okay.

475
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:50,523
Thanks.

476
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:52,812
I'll call you later.

477
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:00,911
Morning, honey.

478
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:05,905
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Good night.

479
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,408
Wait. Wait a minute.

480
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,962
How was Lloyd?

481
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:16,962
Lloyd was a gentleman.
He was funny, nervous and strange.

482
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:22,384
I met people I'd never met before.
Then I blew it. I called him "basic."

483
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,133
- Can you believe I did that?
- Well...

484
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:31,137
I don't think he's reeling
in embarrassment.

485
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,319
Good night.

486
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,361
Good night.

487
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,411
Lloyd is doomed.
- Meaning?

488
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:54,416
She made this date a family audition,
the kiss of death for Lloyd.

489
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,334
- Why?
- Too much pressure. Not his crowd.

490
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,499
What's wrong with her?

491
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:04,303
- I told him to be himself.
- He has that nervous talking thing.

492
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,470
I told him not to speak.

493
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:11,426
This is a strange thing to say,
but maybe Diane really likes Lloyd.

494
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:15,310
If you were her,
would you honestly fall for Lloyd?

495
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,610
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

496
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:25,687
Yeah.

497
00:37:28,787 --> 00:37:30,745
Should I wear this dress?
- Yeah.

498
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,161
- Or I could always wear this one.
- That's nice.

499
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:48,133
I forgot to tell you
who'll be at dinner tonight.

500
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:52,973
My dad's accountant and two women
that work in his nursing home.

501
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:56,220
I know you don't know them,
but it'll be fun.

502
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,392
- Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
- I know. I've had it forever.

503
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,025
I used to mark the words
that I looked up.

504
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:24,163
Or I have this one.

505
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:27,131
- Nice one.
- Yeah?

506
00:38:27,342 --> 00:38:31,091
- Yeah, you should wear that.
- Think so?

507
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:38,968
- Better get downstairs, huh?
- I'll change.

508
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:51,903
Great meal, you two.

509
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:55,860
- You look beautiful, Diane.
- Thank you.

510
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:59,410
Same features. See what
a few millimeters can do?

511
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:04,496
What airline are you flying?
- A charter.

512
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,916
She's not the greatest flyer.

513
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,670
- When she was 8...
- Dad.

514
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:12,665
- Now, why can't I tell the story?
- What story?

515
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:16,929
- If you're gonna tell it, let me.
- Well, let me start.

516
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:21,341
I decide to take her
on her first airplane.

517
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,513
I knew how planes flew
but I was nervous.

518
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,721
Crash paranoia.

519
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:31,401
I had a list. If babies were on
the plane, it couldn't crash.

520
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,730
But their crying meant
they knew something.

521
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:40,108
They closed the doors and she screams,
like nobody I'd ever heard.

522
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:42,943
- You said, "Turn around."
- They did.

523
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:44,740
- Let me finish.
- Okay.

524
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:47,873
So two federal marshals
meet the plane.

525
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:53,423
They take our address and ask us
never to fly the friendly skies again.

526
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,124
- You never flew?
- No.

527
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:59,343
But there's more!

528
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:02,223
There was somebody on the plane...

529
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:05,680
...who worked in a recording studio.

530
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:11,017
He's making a sound effects record,
and he wants to record her scream.

531
00:40:11,232 --> 00:40:14,814
Which they did. And once
in a while on a commercial...

532
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:17,603
...you can hear me scream.

533
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:28,247
You two are amazing. You know?

534
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:31,370
The way you... The way you talk.

535
00:40:32,793 --> 00:40:36,375
I'm just like that...
I'm not like that with anybody.

536
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:51,932
- Stellar jukebox, sir.
- Thanks.

537
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:57,566
- How do you obtain one of those?
- What did we pay for the Wurlitzer?

538
00:40:57,774 --> 00:41:02,022
The guy didn't want to part with it.
A matter of $9000?

539
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:05,523
- So you graduated Lakewood, right?
- Yes, sir.

540
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:08,741
- What are you gonna do now?
- Yeah, Lloyd.

541
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:12,030
What are your plans for the future?

542
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:16,916
Spend as much time as possible
with Diane before she leaves.

543
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:18,240
Seriously.

544
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:22,044
- I'm totally and completely serious.
- No, really.

545
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,798
You mean a career?

546
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,465
I don't know. I've...

547
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:36,218
I've thought about this quite a bit,
and I would have to say...

548
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,720
...I don't wanna sell, buy,
or process anything as a career.

549
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:46,392
Or sell anything bought or processed
or buy anything sold or processed...

550
00:41:46,613 --> 00:41:49,317
...or process anything
sold or bought...

551
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:53,482
...or repair anything sold,
bought or processed.

552
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:55,660
My father's in the Army.

553
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:00,199
He wants me to join, but I can't
work for that corporation.

554
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,334
So lately I've been kickboxing.

555
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,834
Which is a new sport,
but I think it's got a good future.

556
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:15,384
As far as career longevity,
you can't really tell.

557
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,634
Eight and six as a fighter is no good.

558
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:22,931
But I can't tell if I'm great
until I've had pro fights.

559
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:25,557
I haven't been knocked down.

560
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,486
I can't figure it all out,
so I'm gonna hang with Diane.

561
00:42:40,997 --> 00:42:41,911
Hello.

562
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:44,615
- Mr. James Court?
- Can I help you?

563
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:47,539
I'm Mr. Sims. This is Mr. Talbot.

564
00:42:47,754 --> 00:42:50,375
We're special agents of the IRS.

565
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:55,132
We'd like to inform you that you're
under criminal investigation...

566
00:42:55,344 --> 00:42:59,009
...for the tax years
1982 through 1986.

567
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:02,888
Jesus. What, I live in
a palace, right?

568
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:04,846
I have guests here.

569
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:08,727
- Understand the following...
- Speak with my lawyer.

570
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:10,933
You won't answer questions?

571
00:43:11,484 --> 00:43:14,735
Just come down to my office.
I have guests.

572
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:19,358
We will be contacting a number
of your business associates...

573
00:43:19,576 --> 00:43:22,991
- This evening is over.
...and your former wife.

574
00:43:27,832 --> 00:43:29,625
Mom, please.

575
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:34,793
I do have a history with this man,
and it's not the greatest.

576
00:43:37,425 --> 00:43:41,008
I see you so seldom.
I'd rather hear about you.

577
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:43,713
This is me telling you about me.

578
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,803
I don't know if you have a boyfriend.

579
00:43:47,518 --> 00:43:51,980
What could be more important
than what's going on with Dad?

580
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:58,234
If we could talk about boys,
everything would be so much easier.

581
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,028
Your room is always ready.
You can always come home if you want.

582
00:44:12,207 --> 00:44:14,913
All right. What do you want me to do?

583
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:18,622
If they ask you questions...

584
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,707
...would you please say
something nice about him, Mom?

585
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,503
Help him?

586
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,634
- All right.
- You will?

587
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:28,887
Okay. Oh, here's Ray.

588
00:44:30,684 --> 00:44:34,764
Talk to him. When you don't,
your mouth turns down. Hi!

589
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,018
Hello, pretty ladies.

590
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:41,022
Hi, Diane.

591
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:42,854
Hi, Ray.

592
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:47,738
What are you doing after work?

593
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,818
<i>I have a break after dinner,</i>
<i>if you wanna stop by.</i>

594
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:58,081
- Wanna do something later?
- I know you think my job's strange.

595
00:44:58,292 --> 00:45:01,579
- You don't like old people, do you?
- Sure I do.

596
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:03,042
<i>Come on.</i>

597
00:45:03,256 --> 00:45:05,961
I used to work at a smorgasbord.

598
00:45:06,176 --> 00:45:09,378
Old people came, and they love to eat.

599
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:14,970
They jammed their mouths, ate with
their mouths open and it was too much.

600
00:45:15,184 --> 00:45:18,138
You think about how short life is...

601
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:22,559
...and how maybe life has no meaning.
You're frying burgers.

602
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:26,723
<i>Then you're like 60, you die</i>
<i>and what are you doing?</i>

603
00:45:26,945 --> 00:45:32,071
I don't need to think about it.
That's the reason I was...

604
00:45:33,826 --> 00:45:35,986
But I'm not sure I'm right.

605
00:45:36,204 --> 00:45:40,997
That's ageism, being prejudiced
against people because they're old.

606
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:44,993
- Maybe their mouths don't work well.
- Really?

607
00:45:46,672 --> 00:45:50,290
Well, you're really
turning me around here.

608
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:53,593
<i>I was looking at it</i>
<i>the wrong way, I think.</i>

609
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,341
- Should I still come by?
- Stop by later.

610
00:45:57,598 --> 00:46:00,351
<i>- Okay. I will.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

611
00:46:00,936 --> 00:46:03,343
I'll see you later. Bye.

612
00:46:11,446 --> 00:46:13,188
You have to meet Bess.

613
00:46:13,448 --> 00:46:16,863
She's amazing. She's 93.
She's a writer.

614
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:20,657
- And I told her about you.
- You told her about me?

615
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:24,414
What did you say?

616
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:29,204
Just meet her.

617
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:37,463
- Hi.
- Hi.

618
00:46:37,845 --> 00:46:40,881
This is Bess. Lloyd, Bess.

619
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:42,344
- Hello.
- Hello.

620
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:46,094
You're too tall.

621
00:46:50,815 --> 00:46:52,145
She likes you.

622
00:46:54,486 --> 00:46:56,111
Okay, how you doing?

623
00:46:58,156 --> 00:46:59,650
I'm Lloyd.

624
00:47:02,744 --> 00:47:07,453
We're gonna watch <i>Cocoon.</i> I haven't
seen it but I hear it's good.

625
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:12,162
I hear it makes you happy,
so I figure that's a good film to see.

626
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:16,210
Some older people go to space...
Hope I didn't spoil it.

627
00:47:16,425 --> 00:47:19,091
It hasn't started yet, Mr. Taylor.

628
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:20,924
- Thank you.
Good!

629
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:22,630
You gonna stay?
Sure.

630
00:47:22,846 --> 00:47:27,008
Why can't I eat popcorn?
I'll get you something.

631
00:47:29,686 --> 00:47:33,814
Okay. So here we go with <i>Cocoon.</i>

632
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:41,353
- So they're cool.
- That was good.

633
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:47,411
I feel so bad being with you.

634
00:47:48,745 --> 00:47:53,039
I feel like I should be spending
more time with my dad.

635
00:47:55,752 --> 00:48:00,129
Half the time I'm with you,
I'm thinking of other things.

636
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:07,338
Everybody does that.

637
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:12,383
I just don't want it to get too heavy.
I feel really overloaded.

638
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:22,310
I have a theory that good things
always happen with bad things.

639
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:27,272
I know you have to deal with them
at the same time but I just...

640
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,358
I don't know why they have
to happen at the same time.

641
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:36,867
I wish I could work out a schedule.
Am I babbling? Know what I mean?

642
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:38,494
No.

643
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,838
I just can't have a social life now.

644
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:56,223
Don't worry, we're just
having coffee. We'll be anti-social.

645
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,312
- Be friends?
- Yeah. With potential.

646
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,480
Friends with potential.

647
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:09,737
Keep going in first.
Feel the clutch. Put it in a little.

648
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:13,731
It'll come out. Then you'll feel...
A little more.

649
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:17,900
That's right. Go around, in first.
Keep it in first.

650
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,871
It's kind of all right.

651
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:25,502
When you feel you're confident,
if you'll just ease into second...

652
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,623
All right. Well, put it...

653
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,087
- Am I wrecking my car?
- You are a little bit.

654
00:49:36,347 --> 00:49:38,138
But listen...

655
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:41,967
...when you feel it start to give,
put the clutch in.

656
00:49:42,186 --> 00:49:46,896
- I was putting the gas on when...
- Because... Little more gas.

657
00:49:47,107 --> 00:49:51,056
Ease it out. All right.
Don't worry. Minor setback.

658
00:49:51,695 --> 00:49:54,861
You feel confident? You feel better.

659
00:49:55,072 --> 00:49:57,942
Now go into second. Little more gas.

660
00:49:58,158 --> 00:49:59,238
Yeah.

661
00:49:59,494 --> 00:50:02,116
You'll get this. No problem.

662
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:08,581
Now, maybe, you downshift. First.

663
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:16,926
- Does this sound normal?
- As you get better, you'll hear less.

664
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,051
Brake.

665
00:50:29,856 --> 00:50:32,774
Let's switch. Wanna switch?
I'll drive?

666
00:50:43,702 --> 00:50:45,280
I'm sorry.

667
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:49,661
- Let's go. You want to?
- Yeah.

668
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,074
Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

669
00:51:58,355 --> 00:52:00,147
Are you shaking?

670
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,856
No.

671
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:05,153
You're shaking.

672
00:52:07,697 --> 00:52:10,781
- I don't think so.
- You're cold.

673
00:52:11,701 --> 00:52:15,367
- I don't think I am.
- Then why are you shaking?

674
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:17,407
I don't know.

675
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,957
I think I'm happy.

676
00:52:22,963 --> 00:52:24,955
Here's some blanket.

677
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,464
Listen to this song.
It's a really good song.

678
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:58,952
Good morning.

679
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:04,491
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- You should be.

680
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,542
- I should have called.
- You bet you should have!

681
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:13,085
Don't make me call the police.
Don't make me call hospitals.

682
00:53:13,302 --> 00:53:16,752
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I know this is a bad time.

683
00:53:16,972 --> 00:53:20,007
I'm not asking what you did.
I wanna know...

684
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,804
...if you're okay.
- I'm fine.

685
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:26,886
You wanna make things easier?
Tell me where you were.

686
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:28,979
This is bullshit!

687
00:53:31,693 --> 00:53:36,486
- You can say anything to me, you know.
- I know that.

688
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:43,783
I spent the night with him.

689
00:53:44,707 --> 00:53:47,742
- Lloyd?
- Dad, yes.

690
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:52,954
And I'm scared to death of what
you must think of me right now.

691
00:54:02,098 --> 00:54:03,379
Sit down.

692
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:20,900
Dad, do you know what he did
the first night I went out with him?

693
00:54:21,408 --> 00:54:24,076
We were walking across by the 7-11...

694
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:31,203
...and he pointed out some glass
for me to walk around.

695
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,995
I think of that when people say,
"What are you doing with Lloyd?"

696
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,219
And I never get nervous around him.

697
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:48,431
So we started spending all
this time together, as friends.

698
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:53,850
But I could feel him getting anxious.

699
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:55,765
And then...

700
00:54:56,022 --> 00:55:01,147
...I knew that there would be
a confrontation over getting physical.

701
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,939
He started to get that look
at the end of the night.

702
00:55:07,158 --> 00:55:09,067
Do you know that look?

703
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:13,825
You know it will be an issue.

704
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,081
So I went through all the feelings
and arguments you go through...

705
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:22,878
- Did he ever get rough with you?
- Dad, no.

706
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:29,710
But I didn't want any problems,
so I decided not to sleep with him.

707
00:55:31,014 --> 00:55:33,685
But then I attacked him anyway.

708
00:55:37,145 --> 00:55:40,644
It always feels good
to tell you the truth.

709
00:55:40,856 --> 00:55:42,435
Because...

710
00:55:42,734 --> 00:55:47,443
...if I can't share it with you,
it's almost like it didn't happen.

711
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:51,192
Did you sleep with her?

712
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,233
- I admit nothing.
- It's us.

713
00:55:56,496 --> 00:56:01,917
- Look at his face. He did the deed.
- You're an inspiration, Lloyd.

714
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:05,872
All right, calm down.
Nothing's different.

715
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:11,295
Lloyd, listen to me. Everything
has changed. You've had sex.

716
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:15,676
Nothing will ever be the same
between you two.

717
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:20,349
You might be 60, you'll see her,
talk to her, whatever...

718
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:24,226
But what you'll really
be thinking is, "We had sex."

719
00:56:25,525 --> 00:56:27,979
- Your point?
- Do something special.

720
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:30,649
- You gotta make a statement.
- Wait...

721
00:56:30,863 --> 00:56:34,446
Show her respect.
Show her you're not like Joe.

722
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,200
- Wait...
- Above all...

723
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:39,743
...just because this happened
gives you no right...

724
00:56:39,953 --> 00:56:43,370
- You never let me talk.
- What? I'm sorry. Talk.

725
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,248
Forgot what I was gonna say.

726
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:49,455
Okay, I remember.

727
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,175
- Let him do what he wants.
- All right.

728
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:58,760
Send her flowers
or write her a letter.

729
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:00,796
I already did.

730
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,599
- What's it say?
- Just read it.

731
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:05,434
I can read it?

732
00:57:08,689 --> 00:57:10,516
Oh, man.

733
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:14,819
"Dear Diane:

734
00:57:15,072 --> 00:57:20,146
I'll always be there for you.
All the love in my heart...

735
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:21,696
...LIoyd."

736
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:31,243
I've never gotten a letter
like this. Have you?

737
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:34,378
- I dream about it.
- So, what do you think?

738
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:39,002
- You think I'm...?
- Get ready for greatness, Lloyd.

739
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:49,640
The Cynthia Bramson estate
was worth how much?

740
00:57:49,854 --> 00:57:53,187
- Her family...
- Family? Never heard from them.

741
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:56,315
I sold her house for her.
Made her money.

742
00:57:56,902 --> 00:57:59,736
Your income, Mr. Court...

743
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:03,398
...hasn't changed substantially
in 17 years.

744
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:04,780
That's right.

745
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:09,530
Why would you stay so long
with an operation...

746
00:58:09,748 --> 00:58:12,951
...that is clearly not
a growth enterprise?

747
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:16,287
Caring for people
isn't a growth enterprise.

748
00:58:16,503 --> 00:58:19,873
Write that down.
I'd like your boss to read it.

749
00:58:26,138 --> 00:58:27,763
Diane!

750
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,132
Ticket to England came today.

751
00:58:35,521 --> 00:58:39,104
Maybe I shouldn't go
with all that's happening.

752
00:58:39,317 --> 00:58:40,347
You're going.

753
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:44,897
If a friend were in the same position,
I'd tell her to stay.

754
00:58:45,114 --> 00:58:47,687
- You're going.
- It doesn't feel right.

755
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:51,573
- I don't even have the right luggage.
<i>- Bon voyage.</i>

756
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,077
- You're not listening to me.
- Let's stop this right now.

757
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:00,123
Let's not put our energy
into something ridiculous.

758
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:03,296
This isn't smart thinking.

759
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:08,003
Why are you acting this way?
Is it because of the other morning?

760
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:09,298
You love him?

761
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:13,679
- I like him a lot.
- Now, I know you like him.

762
00:59:13,892 --> 00:59:16,892
He's not like those
frat kids you dislike.

763
00:59:17,103 --> 00:59:19,593
But when the excitement wears off...

764
00:59:19,814 --> 00:59:22,481
...what are you gonna talk about?

765
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:25,936
You'll be in an
international think tank...

766
00:59:26,153 --> 00:59:29,936
...and he's gonna be
kicking punching bags.

767
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:34,368
I think you should break up with him.

768
00:59:34,577 --> 00:59:37,282
Unbelievable. This is a nightmare.

769
00:59:37,538 --> 00:59:41,120
It'd be best to get on
that plane with no strings...

770
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:44,335
...because once you leave,
things will change.

771
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:47,748
I've talked about this
with you and with him.

772
00:59:47,965 --> 00:59:50,041
It's well-covered territory.

773
00:59:50,259 --> 00:59:55,004
I'm not asking you to sever
all relations with the boy.

774
00:59:55,264 --> 00:59:57,719
Give him a present. Here.

775
00:59:57,933 --> 01:00:01,716
Let him know you still care.
Give him this pen.

776
01:00:01,937 --> 01:00:03,051
A pen?

777
01:00:03,272 --> 01:00:07,683
Dad, in a million years,
I would never give him a pen.

778
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:11,600
Why can't I have fun? I like him.

779
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:15,901
"I like him"? I'm talking
about being honest and decent...

780
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:18,109
Dad, I love him.

781
01:00:22,914 --> 01:00:24,160
Great.

782
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:26,873
No, that's great.

783
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:30,085
It's great to hear
you say that because...

784
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:33,334
I don't know.
What, am I being selfish?

785
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,716
Why am I so fixated?

786
01:00:39,054 --> 01:00:42,258
Maybe because I've got
a lot of troubles with...

787
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:45,227
Is that it? Am I being selfish?

788
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:50,223
I want you to have everything.
Is that wrong?

789
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:55,561
I owe you an apology.

790
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:59,194
I've just got a few weeks
left with you and we...

791
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,742
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

792
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:08,162
They think I'm guilty.

793
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:15,036
Some computer spits out your name
and another honest man...

794
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,256
What's the goddamn point?

795
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,846
Live your life.

796
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:28,632
- I love you.
- Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry.

797
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,567
All right now, power left!

798
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,099
Power right!

799
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:44,648
- Who's worid champ?
- Don "The Dragon" Wilson!

800
01:01:44,907 --> 01:01:46,700
Lloyd! Telephone!

801
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:48,495
Keep kicking.

802
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,571
Hello?

803
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:55,031
Hi.

804
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:56,828
How you doing?

805
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:01,216
Yeah, they actually pay me for this.

806
01:02:03,844 --> 01:02:06,001
I'll pick you up in an hour.

807
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,095
See you later.

808
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,968
Check your mail tomorrow.

809
01:02:15,186 --> 01:02:18,438
I sent you a letter. A blue letter.

810
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:20,647
- It came yesterday.
- It did?

811
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:23,564
- It was wonderful.
- You didn't tell me?

812
01:02:23,778 --> 01:02:27,360
- It was wonderful.
- I never sent a letter like that.

813
01:02:27,574 --> 01:02:30,146
I sent it... Well, I don't know...

814
01:02:30,409 --> 01:02:33,614
I wanted to say something
but I didn't.

815
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:36,914
But I think I want to now.
But I'm not sure.

816
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:40,493
Many say it and don't mean it,
but I think I do.

817
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:43,831
- So I wanted to say...
- We don't have to say it.

818
01:02:44,047 --> 01:02:46,540
- How do you know what it is?
- I don't...

819
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,965
...but thank you.
- I love you.

820
01:02:49,803 --> 01:02:52,720
- I said it.
- I know.

821
01:02:56,435 --> 01:03:01,595
- Let's not put things on this level.
- What? This is a good level.

822
01:03:02,357 --> 01:03:03,982
Isn't it?

823
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:12,312
- How can I look at you and say this?
- Say what?

824
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:19,412
I think we should spend
some time apart.

825
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:23,578
- What's wrong?
- Well...

826
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:28,663
...I need to study...
- You need to study?

827
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,088
How much time do you need?

828
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,468
You'll be leaving soon,
so I'm just asking.

829
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,303
We'll see.

830
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:38,170
Okay.

831
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:44,221
- It's good knowing this.
- Yeah.

832
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:54,231
Wait a minute.

833
01:03:54,824 --> 01:03:56,732
What did we just decide?

834
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:02,369
- We decided...
- Did you break up with me?

835
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,830
- It sounded like it.
- We decided to be friends.

836
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,666
It sounds terrible but...

837
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,712
If we're friends,
can't we see each other?

838
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:16,750
I think that we should stop
going out on dates.

839
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:19,918
Oh.

840
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:23,632
I feel like a dick.

841
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,849
- You must think I'm a dick.
- No.

842
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,389
- I don't.
- You do.

843
01:04:28,605 --> 01:04:31,606
We shared the most intimate thing.

844
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:35,101
- You shared it with a dick.
- No, I didn't.

845
01:04:37,738 --> 01:04:40,110
- Is this because of your dad?
- No.

846
01:04:40,324 --> 01:04:42,031
Did you talk to Corey?

847
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:45,325
- Why? Did you tell her?
- She figured it out.

848
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:49,072
No, she'll tell everybody,
but that's fine.

849
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,701
- Did you tell anybody?
- Just my dad.

850
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:56,201
You told your dad?

851
01:04:58,091 --> 01:05:01,127
You have Corey and D.C.
I have my dad.

852
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:05,554
I'm sorry I said that.
I said what I thought I meant...

853
01:05:05,765 --> 01:05:07,424
...but forget it.
- Lloyd.

854
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:11,680
- "I love you." Okay?
- What are you doing with your hands?

855
01:05:11,936 --> 01:05:14,724
You're talking like that girl Sheila.

856
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:18,066
Don't be mean!
This is hard for me too.

857
01:05:20,611 --> 01:05:22,438
Then don't do it.

858
01:05:24,198 --> 01:05:25,990
Shit.

859
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:41,208
Would you just take this pen,
please, and write me?

860
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:58,100
I don't believe this.
You just broke up with me.

861
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:00,029
Hello, Constance? It's me, Lloyd.

862
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,199
Nothing. I'm just driving around.

863
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:09,829
She broke up with me.

864
01:07:11,175 --> 01:07:14,839
What do I do? How can I get her back?

865
01:07:15,053 --> 01:07:17,343
I can't get her to talk to me.

866
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:20,886
It's all so fucked up.

867
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:25,059
I feel like crying.

868
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:33,608
She gave me a pen.

869
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:37,234
I gave her my heart.
She gave me a pen.

870
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:40,777
Just come home, okay?

871
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:46,742
I'll be home soon.

872
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:59,258
<i>Most don't know what</i>
<i>to do after graduation.</i>

873
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:03,384
<i>But I've got guaranteed</i>
<i>skill training. In the Army.</i>

874
01:08:03,598 --> 01:08:07,432
<i>Reserve the Army's sought-after</i>
<i>technical training...</i>

875
01:08:07,644 --> 01:08:09,304
<i>... 12 months in advance.</i>

876
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:16,817
It's me. Cruising around.
I know I haven't called you lately.

877
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:19,779
I didn't wanna be reminded of Diane.

878
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:25,411
I've wiped her from my mind. I don't
remember when or where I knew her.

879
01:08:27,121 --> 01:08:30,654
Here's the site of our
controversial first date.

880
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,369
I met her in a mall.

881
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,793
I should've known
our relationship was doomed.

882
01:08:38,465 --> 01:08:40,422
To our left, we have...

883
01:08:40,634 --> 01:08:44,501
...the street where we broke up!
Here's the path we took.

884
01:08:48,308 --> 01:08:52,388
Corey, I guess I blamed you
for letting me send the letter.

885
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:57,147
But I thought it was right too.
I think I know too many giris.

886
01:08:57,358 --> 01:08:59,645
I should hang with more guys.

887
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:05,235
I should be like those guys who hang
at the AM-PM or the Gas 'n' Sip.

888
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:08,485
But do guys like that
know the answers?

889
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,735
No babe is worth it, you know?

890
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:14,488
We'll teach you bibles of truths.

891
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:17,496
You can't trust them. Know what it is?

892
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:22,038
They spend your money and tell
their friends. It's economics.

893
01:09:22,256 --> 01:09:25,507
You gotta find a girl
who looks just like her...

894
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:28,884
...nail her and dump her.
Get her off your mind.

895
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:34,172
Diane Court is a show pony.
You need a stallion, my friend.

896
01:09:34,393 --> 01:09:37,228
- Walk with us and walk tall.
Walk tall.

897
01:09:37,438 --> 01:09:40,057
- Bitches, man!
Give him a complex.

898
01:09:40,273 --> 01:09:42,680
- Dude, I better bail.
Okay, man.

899
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:45,859
- Later, Luke.
- Be cool, man.

900
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
I got a question.

901
01:09:48,113 --> 01:09:50,403
If you know so much about women...

902
01:09:50,616 --> 01:09:55,954
...why are you at a Gas 'n' Sip alone
on a Saturday, with no women anywhere?

903
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,164
- By choice, man.
- It's a conscious choice.

904
01:10:03,379 --> 01:10:05,538
We're choosing to be here.

905
01:10:05,757 --> 01:10:09,587
- I'm choosing it.
- Dude, where'd she dump you, man?

906
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:11,592
- My car.
- Your car?

907
01:10:11,803 --> 01:10:15,218
- Dissed in the Malibu?
- Oh, heinous!

908
01:10:15,432 --> 01:10:19,809
- That's your castle, man.
- No chance with a girl like that.

909
01:10:20,019 --> 01:10:22,557
Hey, man. I was in love once, man.

910
01:10:23,606 --> 01:10:25,847
I got hurt really bad.

911
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:29,776
I never wanna go through that again.

912
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:34,616
- You're bringing me down!
- Shut up, man!

913
01:10:34,826 --> 01:10:38,408
We're going to a kegger.
We'd like you to come.

914
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:41,193
We're gonna find you a babe, man.

915
01:10:41,415 --> 01:10:45,459
We're gonna find you one hot babe.
Instantly! Promise!

916
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:48,001
One hot babe for you!

917
01:10:48,212 --> 01:10:51,331
I won't meet a girl
like Diane at a kegger.

918
01:10:51,549 --> 01:10:56,922
She was different. We didn't even have
to go out to go out. We'd just hang.

919
01:10:57,763 --> 01:11:00,514
The girl made me trust myself, man.

920
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,559
I was walking around,
feeling satisfied.

921
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:07,601
Can you imagine that?
And then she cuts me loose.

922
01:11:07,815 --> 01:11:11,728
I don't know why. She won't say.
Who knows the reason?

923
01:11:11,943 --> 01:11:16,568
Maybe it's her father. She won't
talk to me. Won't look at me.

924
01:11:16,782 --> 01:11:17,896
Come on!

925
01:11:18,115 --> 01:11:21,567
- Christ, what's up with you?
- You're freaking out!

926
01:11:21,786 --> 01:11:23,861
- Chill, man!
- You're wigging.

927
01:11:24,078 --> 01:11:26,202
<i>He's wigging, man</i>
<i>He's wigging</i>

928
01:11:26,414 --> 01:11:29,285
I don't even feel that way
about my car.

929
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:31,576
<i>He's wigging every day</i>

930
01:11:31,796 --> 01:11:37,002
Dude, name a babe, okay?
Any babe in Seattle. I'll set you up.

931
01:11:37,258 --> 01:11:38,717
Diane Court!

932
01:11:38,968 --> 01:11:41,340
Dude, I can't do it, buddy.

933
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:44,343
<i>Lloyd, Lloyd</i>
<i>All null and void</i>

934
01:11:44,557 --> 01:11:48,222
<i>Listen to the truth</i>
<i>You're trying to avoid, Lloyd</i>

935
01:11:51,814 --> 01:11:54,269
That was a mistake.

936
01:11:57,027 --> 01:12:00,028
The rain on my car is a baptism.

937
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:02,195
I'm the new me.

938
01:12:02,532 --> 01:12:03,861
Ice-man.

939
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:08,245
Power-Lloyd. My assault
on the worid begins now.

940
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:11,706
I believe in myself. Answer to no one.

941
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:16,041
You got it all figured out.

942
01:12:16,252 --> 01:12:21,378
If you start out depressed,
everything's a pleasant surprise.

943
01:12:21,591 --> 01:12:24,925
Look, why don't you
just call Diane again?

944
01:12:26,014 --> 01:12:28,419
I stop at seven unreturned calls.

945
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,305
Understand that her family
is being ripped apart.

946
01:12:32,518 --> 01:12:35,189
Like you and she were ripped apart.

947
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:38,102
Like Joe and I were ripped apart.

948
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:44,652
- Visit her at the home.
- I'm not going back there.

949
01:12:44,864 --> 01:12:48,068
- I don't even know her.
- Why are you like this?

950
01:12:48,283 --> 01:12:52,232
- Because I'm a guy. I have pride.
- You're not a guy.

951
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,866
I am.

952
01:12:54,081 --> 01:12:57,035
The worid is full of guys. Be a man.

953
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,539
Don't be a guy.

954
01:13:01,128 --> 01:13:03,916
If she wants me, she can come to me.

955
01:13:05,342 --> 01:13:06,669
<i>Hi. Lloyd.</i>

956
01:13:06,885 --> 01:13:11,048
<i>- This is my eighth and final call.</i>
- Pick it up if you want.

957
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:16,636
<i>I've thought about it all, and I've</i>
<i>decided to give you another chance.</i>

958
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:21,223
<i>Maybe only your father is listening.</i>
<i>Hey, Mr. Court. Hello.</i>

959
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,901
- If I get it, we'll get back together.
- Then don't.

960
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:30,688
<i>Maybe I didn't know you.</i>
<i>Maybe the worid is a mirage...</i>

961
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:34,027
<i>... and everyone's hurtling</i>
<i>toward necropolis.</i>

962
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:38,323
<i>Maybe there's good in this.</i>
<i>You're probably screening.</i>

963
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:43,283
<i>Just one other thing. The letter</i>
<i>I wrote you. Could you rip it up?</i>

964
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:47,453
<i>Nuke it. Destroy it.</i>
<i>It hurts me to know it's out there.</i>

965
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,665
<i>Could you do that for me?</i>

966
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,591
<i>All right. Later.</i>

967
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:53,000
Hello?

968
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:09,481
Hi.

969
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:14,274
- Is it for your wife?
- I'm unmarried. It's for my daughter.

970
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:17,824
- Going to school?
- She won a fellowship.

971
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,236
Good for her.

972
01:14:22,496 --> 01:14:26,081
- I'll take the whole set.
- Excellent.

973
01:14:35,177 --> 01:14:38,794
You got the best smile
I've seen all week.

974
01:14:39,013 --> 01:14:41,930
Thanks. I like yours too.

975
01:14:50,316 --> 01:14:54,775
I don't know your name,
but what are you doing for lunch?

976
01:14:54,987 --> 01:14:58,650
I'm sorry, but they
turned down your card.

977
01:14:59,324 --> 01:15:03,191
Oh! Well, here.
Let me give you another card.

978
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:04,524
Thanks.

979
01:15:13,919 --> 01:15:16,671
I'm afraid I can't accept this either.

980
01:15:16,881 --> 01:15:21,627
There's a decline code.
I'm supposed to confiscate it...

981
01:15:21,845 --> 01:15:24,134
...but why don't you keep it?

982
01:15:24,348 --> 01:15:26,554
- Keep it.
- Are you sure?

983
01:15:26,808 --> 01:15:28,634
Yeah, I don't want it.

984
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:32,227
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

985
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:02,624
Dad, are you okay in there?

986
01:16:02,883 --> 01:16:05,340
I'm just finishing up in here!

987
01:17:58,909 --> 01:18:01,067
Regarding James Court?

988
01:18:01,995 --> 01:18:03,988
Room 14.

989
01:18:05,207 --> 01:18:08,243
I'm supposed to be leaving
on a fellowship...

990
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:13,370
...that I worked for my entire life,
and I don't even care.

991
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:19,462
I met this boy over the summer...

992
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:24,139
...and we can't talk because of this.
I can't talk to my dad.

993
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:26,640
I wore these clothes. I thought...

994
01:18:26,854 --> 01:18:30,138
...if I looked right,
someone would talk to me.

995
01:18:30,356 --> 01:18:34,852
But I look and feel awful.
Could you please talk to me?

996
01:18:35,068 --> 01:18:37,227
Be a little decent.

997
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:47,738
We believe your father
has a large pool of cash...

998
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:50,744
...from phony billing, phony patients.

999
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,083
We've been investigating him.
When they die, he takes their money.

1000
01:18:56,297 --> 01:18:57,495
Pardon me?

1001
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:03,377
Check it out for yourself.
See if your father fits the profile.

1002
01:19:03,596 --> 01:19:08,174
- What's the profile?
- Take a look around the house.

1003
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:12,471
Are there a lot of rugs,
pieces of art, stereo equipment?

1004
01:19:12,688 --> 01:19:16,388
Things bought with cash?
Does he give lots of gifts?

1005
01:19:16,608 --> 01:19:21,733
- Do the major items in your house...?
- You want me to say something.

1006
01:19:21,946 --> 01:19:24,947
Don't let his business
infect your life.

1007
01:19:25,156 --> 01:19:28,028
- How can you say that?
- He's guilty.

1008
01:19:28,244 --> 01:19:29,523
No. He's not.

1009
01:19:32,205 --> 01:19:35,907
We have the records.
We have the proof.

1010
01:19:37,628 --> 01:19:40,297
I'm sorry to have to tell you this...

1011
01:19:40,505 --> 01:19:42,628
...but it's going to get worse.

1012
01:19:42,841 --> 01:19:46,256
If I were you,
I would take that fellowship.

1013
01:19:54,268 --> 01:19:55,763
Dad?

1014
01:19:58,773 --> 01:20:00,979
Anybody home?

1015
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,714
They made me doubt you.

1016
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:12,563
What happened to you?

1017
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:20,569
Did you do it?
Did you take that money?

1018
01:22:20,781 --> 01:22:23,734
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.

1019
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:27,995
- Swear to God. I need the truth.
- Honey!

1020
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:31,614
- Swear to God.
- I swear to God.

1021
01:22:33,627 --> 01:22:35,749
I found the money.

1022
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,931
It's not what you think.

1023
01:22:49,143 --> 01:22:52,557
- What am I supposed to think?
- About what?

1024
01:22:53,396 --> 01:22:56,183
You stole from them! You lied to me!

1025
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,224
- How do you think I feel?
- You know what this money is?

1026
01:23:00,444 --> 01:23:02,768
No, you don't! It's not for me!

1027
01:23:02,986 --> 01:23:05,858
It's for when you
get back from England...

1028
01:23:06,074 --> 01:23:08,825
...so you don't have to
depend on anybody.

1029
01:23:09,035 --> 01:23:12,902
I take better care of those people
than their families!

1030
01:23:13,122 --> 01:23:17,700
I care for them, give them flowers,
feed them, wipe their mouths!

1031
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:21,667
- But you stole from them!
- I make their lives better!

1032
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,003
You let me defend you.

1033
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:33,511
You knew you were guilty, and you
let me become a part of it! How...?

1034
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:38,553
Go ahead. When I'm old, give me
someone like me, but go ahead.

1035
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:43,480
I trusted you. I stood up in court
five years ago and picked you!

1036
01:23:43,693 --> 01:23:48,319
Why are you being so hateful to me?
Because of Lloyd?

1037
01:23:48,532 --> 01:23:52,860
No. I told you everything,
and you lied to me.

1038
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:57,778
- I would've done anything for you.
- Work it out.

1039
01:23:57,998 --> 01:23:59,954
No! I will.

1040
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:05,044
I won't leave anything out
because I can say anything to you.

1041
01:24:05,255 --> 01:24:10,000
- You're a liar and a thief.
- Easy. I'm the only dad you got.

1042
01:24:13,638 --> 01:24:15,130
I'm so ashamed.

1043
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:19,261
Don't say that. It's not good for you.

1044
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:20,852
You're right.

1045
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:25,811
No, talk... Diane!
Wait a minute! Talk...

1046
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:49,588
Someone's here to see you.

1047
01:25:02,224 --> 01:25:03,173
Lloyd?

1048
01:25:05,269 --> 01:25:06,682
God.

1049
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:09,389
Lloyd, I'm sorry.

1050
01:25:13,235 --> 01:25:15,026
What do you want?

1051
01:25:16,656 --> 01:25:18,565
I'm sorry.

1052
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:20,866
What do you want?

1053
01:25:21,326 --> 01:25:25,574
My father's guilty. He lied to me.
He lied to everybody.

1054
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:27,947
I just left home.

1055
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:33,083
I need you.

1056
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:36,663
You do?

1057
01:25:37,134 --> 01:25:40,252
Everything else means nothing to me.

1058
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,796
If I hurt you again, I'll die.

1059
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,677
Hurt me again? Not a chance.

1060
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:48,644
- Don't worry about it.
- I love you.

1061
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,848
- What?
- I love you.

1062
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,900
How many more times
do I have to say it?

1063
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,357
One more time would be nice.

1064
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:03,064
I love you.

1065
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:10,119
Please.

1066
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,157
I love you.

1067
01:26:26,346 --> 01:26:27,889
One question.

1068
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:32,717
Are you here because you need someone,
or because you need me?

1069
01:26:36,606 --> 01:26:38,397
Forget it. I don't care.

1070
01:26:45,154 --> 01:26:46,982
I need you.

1071
01:26:49,661 --> 01:26:51,653
I love you.

1072
01:26:59,127 --> 01:27:02,376
- $ 75,000 fine and no jail.
- I can't do that.

1073
01:27:02,587 --> 01:27:07,500
This guy has been ripping off Grandma
and Grandpa for 17 years.

1074
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,585
- I'd love to hear his story.
- $ 100,000 and three months?

1075
01:27:11,806 --> 01:27:14,295
125,000 and nine months.

1076
01:27:14,557 --> 01:27:15,887
I can accept that.

1077
01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:19,768
- The state takes the home.
- He can serve immediately.

1078
01:27:19,981 --> 01:27:24,771
- I can put that together.
- I'll confirm this with my client.

1079
01:27:24,985 --> 01:27:27,940
- I'll push it past my boss.
- All right.

1080
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:41,916
Just sleep.

1081
01:27:53,761 --> 01:27:58,223
I brought her here,
but she won't get out of the car.

1082
01:27:58,433 --> 01:28:01,185
I wanted her to see you.
If you go away...

1083
01:28:01,394 --> 01:28:04,894
...and not deal with
your family stuff, you just...

1084
01:28:05,106 --> 01:28:08,855
- You going to England with her?
- Let's discuss that.

1085
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:10,354
Are you?

1086
01:28:11,195 --> 01:28:13,188
Am I going?

1087
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:15,989
Am I going to England?

1088
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:20,992
I realize what I should do
is carve out a goal for my future...

1089
01:28:21,204 --> 01:28:24,572
...and find out what I want
to do with my life.

1090
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:27,791
Diane and I can wait
for each other, right?

1091
01:28:28,004 --> 01:28:31,702
She's gonna run off
with some English guy? No way.

1092
01:28:31,923 --> 01:28:34,592
I admire you for not hitching a ride.

1093
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,960
- She's not like you.
- I know.

1094
01:28:37,179 --> 01:28:40,926
- She's very successful. Very talented.
- I know.

1095
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:45,931
But then I reconsidered. Because
what I want to do with my life...

1096
01:28:46,145 --> 01:28:51,305
...what I want to do for a living,
is be with your daughter.

1097
01:28:51,524 --> 01:28:53,434
I'm good at it.

1098
01:28:59,865 --> 01:29:03,779
You're a distraction,
not a permanent part of her life.

1099
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:08,997
I'm the distraction
going with her to England.

1100
01:29:20,011 --> 01:29:24,919
- Are you all right, sir? You okay?
- I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!

1101
01:29:28,934 --> 01:29:32,220
I don't deserve to lose
my daughter over this.

1102
01:29:32,729 --> 01:29:35,565
I don't deserve you as my go-between.

1103
01:29:35,774 --> 01:29:39,108
I can't fathom how she could
choose mediocrity...

1104
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,652
...the way she has with you!

1105
01:30:07,096 --> 01:30:11,224
I have a letter from your daughter.
Do you want it?

1106
01:30:14,186 --> 01:30:16,890
- Thank you, Lloyd.
<i>Visiting hours are now over.</i>

1107
01:30:17,147 --> 01:30:21,643
<i>All visitors must check out</i>
<i>at the main office.</i>

1108
01:30:22,486 --> 01:30:25,189
I don't know which version she sent.

1109
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:36,079
- "The disappointment I feel..."
- I know this part. Keep reading.

1110
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:39,493
She can't still be angry at this.

1111
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:44,206
- It's gotta get better.
- It does, if it's signed "I love you."

1112
01:30:53,556 --> 01:30:55,216
Just her name.

1113
01:31:01,939 --> 01:31:06,730
Just knowing that version exists,
that she did write "I love you"...

1114
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:11,487
...that's a good thing, right?
It's gotta be a good thing.

1115
01:31:25,126 --> 01:31:26,705
Hello.

1116
01:31:28,632 --> 01:31:30,089
Hi.

1117
01:31:33,551 --> 01:31:36,589
I don't know what to say,
except goodbye.

1118
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:47,971
You could have told me the truth.

1119
01:31:48,817 --> 01:31:51,105
I'm so sorry.

1120
01:31:55,907 --> 01:31:57,982
I love you, Dad.

1121
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:16,550
Write me.

1122
01:33:24,531 --> 01:33:26,192
Wing adjustments.

1123
01:33:30,245 --> 01:33:33,696
It's like a roller coaster.
Everybody likes them.

1124
01:33:35,043 --> 01:33:37,330
- Blink if you're fine.
- I'm fine.

1125
01:33:37,544 --> 01:33:39,751
Good, it's all very normal.

1126
01:33:45,258 --> 01:33:47,881
- Very standard for a 747.
- Okay.

1127
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:54,635
If anything happens, it usually
happens in the first five minutes.

1128
01:33:54,852 --> 01:33:58,600
So when the smoking sign
goes "ding," all is okay.

1129
01:33:58,815 --> 01:34:00,391
Good to know.

1130
01:34:01,942 --> 01:34:06,236
I'll keep talking until that
"ding" happens, which is soon.

1131
01:34:07,699 --> 01:34:12,988
Personalized flight kit from Corey.
Books, cassettes, magazines?

1132
01:34:13,535 --> 01:34:15,611
Not right now, thanks.

1133
01:34:22,378 --> 01:34:24,169
How's it going?

1134
01:34:26,382 --> 01:34:28,755
Nobody thought we'd do this.

1135
01:34:29,301 --> 01:34:32,504
Nobody really thinks
it will work, do they?

1136
01:34:32,722 --> 01:34:33,585
No.

1137
01:34:34,471 --> 01:34:37,723
You just described
every great success story.

1138
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,726
It's all right.

1139
01:34:44,357 --> 01:34:45,851
I know.

1140
01:34:49,694 --> 01:34:52,103
- Where's the "ding"?
- It's coming.

1141
01:34:52,531 --> 01:34:54,191
Any second now.

1142
01:35:05,836 --> 01:35:07,744
Any second now.

1143
