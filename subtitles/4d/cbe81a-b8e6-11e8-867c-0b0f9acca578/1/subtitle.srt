1
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:31,881
Where do you think you're going?

2
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:33,890
Going home.

3
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:18,971
Officer.

4
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:23,324
The guy walked into the bushes,
maybe to pee, but he never came back.

5
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:24,971
Do you need help?

6
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:26,726
Do you own this car?

7
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,532
That's not him.
The guy walked into the bushes.

8
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,330
He said he was going home.

9
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:32,761
Going home?

10
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,488
Gentlemen, return to your cars.

11
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:36,881
What about the car?

12
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,090
l'll radio for a tow truck.

13
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:42,483
Let's shove it out of the way.
We'll get this lane moving!

14
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,400
lt's dangerous.

15
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:48,691
We got a lot of glass and steel
rushing by us at high speeds.

16
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,807
Wait a minute.

17
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:55,287
Prendergast. Downtown Robbery.
Let's go.

18
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,170
l'm in linoleum tile, myself.

19
00:05:57,372 --> 00:06:00,170
All right.
You, back in your vehicle.

20
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,328
You push. l'll steer.

21
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,522
We do ceramics too.
Special discount for law officers.

22
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:13,243
l love Cops, the TV show.
Don't you watch it? l never miss it.

23
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:14,931
You're lucky you caught me.

24
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,082
l am?

25
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,641
Today's my last day as a cop.

26
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:20,966
Lucky me.

27
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:25,080
Don't touch it!

28
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,892
Don't touch it!
Just get this lane moving.

29
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:29,929
Okay. Sorry.

30
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:33,160
Officer?

31
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:49,050
Oh, my God! The phone!

32
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,691
Come on, baby.

33
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:56,451
Watch your fingers.

34
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,724
Take Tucker, okay?

35
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:08,131
Mom?

36
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:12,285
Mom, can you help me open this?

37
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:57,681
Can l get some change
for the phone, please?

38
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,527
No change. Have to buy something.

39
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:48,841
- Eighty-fie sen.
- What?

40
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:50,326
Eighty-fie sen.

41
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:53,611
- l don't understand.
- Eighty-fie sen!

42
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,803
Eighty-five cents?

43
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,485
lt doesn't give me enough money
for the phone call.

44
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:07,248
l'll give you 50 cents.
You give me 50 cents change.

45
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:10,086
- No way.
- Yes, way.

46
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:13,081
Drink, eighty-fie sen.
You pay or go!

47
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:17,087
l don't understand "fie. "
There's a "V" in the word "five. "

48
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,441
No "V's" in China?

49
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:21,206
- Not Chinese. l'm Korean.
- Whatever.

50
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:25,889
You come to my country, take my money
and don't even learn my language?

51
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,484
You're Korean?

52
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:35,250
Do you have any idea how much money
my country has given your country?

53
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:36,527
How much?

54
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:41,484
l don't know. lt's a lot.
You can bet on that.

55
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:44,003
You go now! No trouble!

56
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,290
l stay.

57
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:50,251
What do you think of that?

58
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,521
Jesus Christ!

59
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:09,728
What is this?

60
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:12,449
The last stand on Fiji?

61
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,324
Take the money! Take the money!

62
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:17,800
Take the money.

63
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:21,004
Take your hands away from your--
l can't under-- Stop it!

64
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:25,688
All right.
Speak slowly and distinctly.

65
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,166
Take the money.

66
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,085
You think l'm a thief?

67
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,520
You see, l'm not the thief.

68
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,605
l'm not the one charging 85 cents
for a stinking soda!

69
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,285
You're the thief!

70
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:51,281
l'm just standing up
for my rights as a consumer.

71
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:56,769
l'm rolling back prices to 1 965.
What do you think of that?

72
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:03,211
Doughnuts. Package of six.
How much?

73
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:04,688
$1 . 1 2.

74
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:08,846
Too much.

75
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:13,690
Aspirin. Price?

76
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,082
$3.40.

77
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:16,801
Oh, please!

78
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:25,286
AA batteries. Package of four.

79
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:28,887
$4.29.

80
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:32,090
Nice try.

81
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:34,523
This whole shelf looks suspect.

82
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:48,923
One soda. . .

83
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:50,451
. . . 1 2 ounces.

84
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:53,366
Fifty sen!

85
00:11:56,452 --> 00:11:57,885
Sold.

86
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,605
lt's been a pleasure
frequenting your establishment.

87
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,571
Very funny.

88
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:31,683
Very, very funny.

89
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:35,289
Genuine Arizona sand, Prendergast.
Get used to it.

90
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:36,288
l bet.

91
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,927
Genuine Santa Monica sand's
more like it.

92
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:43,211
lt's from my cat's litterbox,
but he said you could keep the lumps.

93
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:47,930
You took my stuff out first?

94
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:49,764
Heck, no. How fun would that be?

95
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,681
- How do l get a pen out?
- Don't need no pen. Use the cat turd.

96
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:59,410
lt's your last day. Be careful.
Remember Forsythe?

97
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:03,209
- Forsythe got 5 minutes to retirement.
- Two!

98
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:07,001
Two minutes, nothing! The guy was
on the way to his fucking car.

99
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:10,369
Mowed down by a runaway impound.
Nasty.

100
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:12,290
- lronic.
- lronic as fuck!

101
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,369
Anything can happen today.

102
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,047
You know how dangerous a desk can be.

103
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,687
Watch out for paper cuts.

104
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,567
Funny, funny, funny.

105
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:24,445
Sorry.
l tried to dissuade them.

106
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:28,082
Hey, Sandra.
lt's obligatory, l guess.

107
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:32,242
Now, what else do they
have up their sleeve?

108
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,007
Nothing.

109
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,883
Are we still on for lunch?
You're not going home early?

110
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:41,400
Why would l go home early?

111
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:43,371
Last day and all.

112
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:44,931
l'm not superstitious.

113
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,288
- Sandy, you ready?
- ln a minute.

114
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,847
Leave the poor desk jockey alone.

115
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,849
See if you know how to start the car.

116
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:55,285
Let's not get
our pantyhose in a bind.

117
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,690
l'll miss you, Prendergast.

118
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,647
You really will? Me too.

119
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,126
Come on, let's go!

120
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:04,885
Lunch?

121
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:28,930
Just a second, baby.

122
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,968
When will we make
the strawberry cake?

123
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:34,521
Soon. l thought
sundown would be good.

124
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,484
Here. Not in the house.

125
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:40,488
Just a few kids. l didn't want
to do a whole big thing.

126
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:17,601
Prendergast here.

127
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,683
lt's me.

128
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,884
l wish you were home.
Wouldn't you come home now?

129
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,691
What's wrong?

130
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:29,407
I don 't know.

131
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,681
l got a little scared. . .

132
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,529
. . .and l'd like you to come home.

133
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,403
What is it, honey?

134
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,806
l don't know.
l was wrapping some. . .

135
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,850
. . .some glasses up
and some things. . .

136
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,684
. . .and l got really scared.

137
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:58,286
You're not doing this move
just for me, are you?

138
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,132
You really want
to do it, don't you?

139
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:05,004
The important thing is we're together.
That's what counts.

140
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:07,490
Yeah, but you're not here.

141
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:09,843
Well, l will be soon, baby.

142
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,366
Say it.

143
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,767
- Say it!
- l'll be home soon.

144
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:21,849
No, say it!

145
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:26,081
l'll be home soon, and l love you.

146
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,130
l love you too.

147
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:32,568
Feel better?

148
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:34,770
No, l don't feel better!

149
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:39,962
London Bridge is falling down

150
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,403
Falling down, falling down

151
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,722
London bridge is falling down
Help me.

152
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,132
My fair lady

153
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:50,971
You my fair lady?

154
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,091
Yes.

155
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,681
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

156
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,888
What you doing, mister?

157
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:52,891
Nothing.

158
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:55,686
You're trespassing on private property.

159
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:57,450
- Trespassing?
- Loitering too.

160
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:59,768
That's right.
You're loitering too.

161
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,202
l didn't see any signs.

162
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:04,490
What you call that?

163
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,285
Graffiti?

164
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:08,848
No, man.

165
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:12,684
That's not fucking graffiti!
That's a sign.

166
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,883
He can't read it, man.

167
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:18,687
l'll read it for you.
lt says this is private property.

168
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:21,408
No fucking trespassing.

169
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,688
This means fucking you!

170
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:27,686
- lt says all that?
- Yeah!

171
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:31,170
lf you wrote it in English,
l'd fucking understand it!

172
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,961
- Thinks he's being funny.
- l'm not laughing.

173
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:36,766
- l'm not either.
- Hold it, fellas.

174
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:39,691
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

175
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:45,250
This is a gangland thing, isn't it?

176
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:48,888
We're having a territorial dispute?

177
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:54,084
l've wandered into your pissing ground
or whatever the damn thing is. . .

178
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:57,364
. . .and you're offended by my presence.
l understand that.

179
00:18:57,572 --> 00:19:01,042
l mean, l wouldn't want you people
in my back yard, either.

180
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:02,924
This is your home. . .

181
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,692
. . .and your home is your home.
l respect that.

182
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:10,010
So if you would just back up
a step or two. . .

183
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,687
. . .l'll take my problems elsewhere.

184
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:15,202
Fair enough?

185
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,363
- What do you think?
- He should pay a toll.

186
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,290
Good idea.

187
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,484
You should pay a toll.

188
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:23,765
Listen, fellas. . .

189
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,964
. . .l've had a rare morning.
l'm not in the mood to--

190
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:28,327
What should he pay?

191
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:30,085
How about that briefcase?

192
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:32,564
Good idea.

193
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,240
Give us your briefcase, man.

194
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,327
l'm not giving you
my goddamn briefcase.

195
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,564
Motherfucker, give us
your motherfucking briefcase!

196
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,492
l was willing
to mind my own business.

197
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:59,169
l was willing to respect your territory
and treat you like a man.

198
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:00,886
You couldn't let a man. . .

199
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:05,887
. . .sit here for five minutes to rest
on your precious piece-of-shit hill?

200
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:11,524
Want my briefcase?
l'll get it for you, all right?

201
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:14,240
You want my briefcase?
Here's my briefcase!

202
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:23,171
Where are you going?

203
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,283
You forgot the briefcase!

204
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,410
l'm going home!
Clear the path, you motherfucker!

205
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,087
Clear the path!

206
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,289
l'm going home!

207
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:01,683
How'd they do that?

208
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:06,241
- Gun!
- What?

209
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,883
You're leaving today, right?
l gotta get your gun.

210
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:12,007
Right.

211
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:17,407
l need your John Doe
right here, here and here.

212
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,810
Got time to take a statement?

213
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:30,282
l know you wanna go
before you get killed. . . .

214
00:21:30,492 --> 00:21:32,767
Yeah, Brian, l'm still working here.

215
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,564
This guy's a little excited.

216
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:37,081
Mr. Lee, come on in.

217
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:42,005
What'd he say?

218
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:45,051
You know, l don't know.
Mr. Lee is Korean.

219
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:48,483
l'm Japanese, in case
you never bothered to notice.

220
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:51,361
- Mr. Lee, speak English, okay?
- Sure.

221
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:53,085
Sit down.

222
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:57,970
He'll help you. Mr. Lee owns a market.
He was hit less than an hour ago.

223
00:21:58,212 --> 00:22:00,487
Sorry, Mr. Lee, no smoking.

224
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:04,969
Mr. Lee, let's just start off
with what he looked like.

225
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,532
White man, white shirt, tie.

226
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:12,281
- What color was his tie?
- Color?

227
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:17,444
l don't know color.
The guy attack me, okay?

228
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:20,041
He bust up my store.
l'm lucky to be alive.

229
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:23,569
Just try and relax.
What did he steal from you?

230
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:25,922
Did not steal!
Attack me, okay?

231
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:28,925
Say he fix my prices.
Bust up my merchandise.

232
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:30,082
He didn't rob you?

233
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:33,244
The guy crazy! l told him,
"Take my money. "

234
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:37,849
He say no. He call me "thief,"
then he break up my merchandise.

235
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:39,844
Then he buy a soda and take off.

236
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,528
He bought a soda. He paid for it?

237
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,888
l told you, the guy crazy.

238
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,128
Sorry, l thought this was a robbery.

239
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:50,360
Mr. Lee, we have to go
talk to somebody else.

240
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,650
You were assaulted.
This man works robberies.

241
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,690
That's right. Come on.

242
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:00,288
- Baseball bat!
- What's that?

243
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:02,011
The guy take my baseball bat.

244
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:03,168
You sell bats?

245
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:06,842
No, keep for defense.
Under counter. Defense.

246
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:10,402
You mean he stole your baseball bat
but paid for the soda?

247
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:11,960
This guy's discriminating.

248
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:14,567
That still doesn't count.
Let's go. Thanks.

249
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:20,605
Go to the hospital.
Your arm might be broken!

250
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:23,372
We'll look for this guy,
so shut the fuck up!

251
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:26,962
What did this guy do?
Threaten you with his credit card?

252
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,730
l told you he had a bat!

253
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:32,129
lf this guy's still around,
we'll find him and fuck him up.

254
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:33,765
Then you go to the hospital?

255
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,206
Shut up!

256
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,682
Cut the crap.
l know it's you.

257
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:54,082
What do you want?

258
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,883
It is you, isn 't it?

259
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:02,320
Yeah, it's me.

260
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:09,085
You gotta stop calling me.

261
00:24:10,252 --> 00:24:12,049
lt's Adele's birthday.

262
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,407
Yes, l know.
What do you want?

263
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,000
l'm coming home.

264
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,164
What are you talking about?

265
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:25,490
l just. . . .

266
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,888
l want you to know that
l'm coming home for her birthday.

267
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,291
You're not coming here.

268
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:36,090
Listen, Beth. . .

269
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:40,650
. . .l gotta see you.

270
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:46,603
No, you listen to me.
This is my house now. l pay the rent.

271
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:48,610
You don't pay child support.

272
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:52,891
- You just can 't walk in and out.
- Don't talk like that, Beth.

273
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,887
l have to come home.

274
00:24:57,612 --> 00:24:59,204
l have to bring her a present.

275
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,531
You know you can't come here!

276
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,328
lt's him! lt's him, man!

277
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:20,962
How's Adele?

278
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:24,405
This isn't your home anymore.

279
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:30,008
How is she?

280
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:34,042
She's doing just fine without you.

281
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,170
- Angie, get out.
- Come on, man.

282
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,722
lt's fucking broad daylight!
This shit ain't worth it!

283
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:44,088
- Get the fuck out!
- Get out of the car!

284
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,084
Give me one. Give me one.

285
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,088
And you?

286
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:49,968
Don't.

287
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,771
l'll call the police.

288
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,362
Go, go, go!

289
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:57,721
l'm coming home.

290
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:01,968
l'm coming home.

291
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,564
Did you get him?

292
00:27:15,892 --> 00:27:16,688
You missed.

293
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:33,090
l missed too.

294
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,851
No, don't fucking do it!

295
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:50,400
No, man.

296
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:51,408
Fuck you, mother--!

297
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:56,680
There, you see?

298
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,483
That's the concept.

299
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:10,892
Take some shooting lessons, asshole!

300
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:33,885
She's open.

301
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,085
Have a seat.

302
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:44,882
Captain.

303
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,091
Did you hear?

304
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,084
The drive-by shooting?

305
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,011
Disgusting!

306
00:28:56,772 --> 00:28:59,081
You know who'll have to take
the heat again. . .

307
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:01,681
. . .when the shit hits the fan.

308
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:09,682
You're retiring a little early.

309
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,487
You won't be getting
your full pension.

310
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:15,884
Yes, sir, that's right.
l won't.

311
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:20,920
This isn't because
you were wounded, is it?

312
00:29:23,732 --> 00:29:25,085
Wounded?

313
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,885
Because, l mean. . .

314
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,563
. . .you're behind a desk now.

315
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:31,888
Not much chance
of getting wounded there.

316
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:35,484
Look, captain, it has nothing
to do with that.

317
00:29:39,772 --> 00:29:41,683
l'll make my speech.

318
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,601
They make me do this,
you understand.

319
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:47,882
l hate to lose a good cop.

320
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:51,286
Not too late to change your mind.

321
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:54,930
Lot of good cops want to drop
the whole kit and caboodle.

322
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,571
And who wouldn't?

323
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:57,966
The pay stinks. . .

324
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:01,801
. . .and you're up to your ears
in human scum 1 6 hours a day.

325
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:05,806
But it gets in your blood.

326
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:09,442
A lot of good cops
get to the point of. . .

327
00:30:09,652 --> 00:30:11,802
. . .slapping their badge down
on this desk. . .

328
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:15,883
. . .and find they just can't do it.
How about you?

329
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:18,203
Will you stick with the team?

330
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:23,690
No, captain.
l don't think l will.

331
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:31,566
Like l say, they make me ask.
You understand.

332
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:34,040
How are the kids?

333
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,890
l don't have any.

334
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:39,683
What the hell?

335
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,647
l'd like to take my stick
to these clerks.

336
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:48,251
- The file says--
- We lost a child.

337
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:49,848
Lost it?

338
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:51,605
Her. Lost her.

339
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,320
Yes, of course. Her.
That's rough.

340
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:58,203
Well, it can be.
Yes, sir.

341
00:31:03,172 --> 00:31:04,400
Still married, right?

342
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,210
Yes, sir, l am.

343
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:16,005
That's good.

344
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:23,805
Where you going?

345
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:25,644
- l'm going home.
- Not this way.

346
00:32:25,972 --> 00:32:29,089
- Why not?
- Metrorail construction, that's why not.

347
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:31,205
Go around.

348
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:33,245
Just follow your tootsies.

349
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:38,131
You sure you don't want something?
Coffee, soda, something?

350
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,203
No, thank you, ma'am.

351
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,248
l feel kind of stupid about this.

352
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,244
Better safe than sorry.

353
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:47,005
That's what l thought.

354
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,807
You have a restraining order
against your husband?

355
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:51,286
Ex-husband.

356
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:53,970
He'd show up on the wrong day. . .

357
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:57,807
. . .or in the middle of the night,
pounding on the door.

358
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:00,681
Thing is, he has
this horrendous temper.

359
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:03,765
l didn't know if a restraining
order was a good idea. . .

360
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:06,008
. . .and if it'd do more harm than good.

361
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:09,808
But the judge said we should
make an example of him.

362
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:14,044
So he can't come
within 1 00 feet of us.

363
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:17,450
Or is it yards?
Which is it? Feet or yards?

364
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,085
That's up to the judge.

365
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:22,090
- l thought it was a set thing.
- lt's at his discretion.

366
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,611
That's interesting.

367
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:24,767
Does he drink?

368
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:29,401
Oh, l thought you meant the judge!

369
00:33:30,212 --> 00:33:32,328
- No, l wouldn't say so.
- Do drugs?

370
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,930
But he has a propensity for violence?

371
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:39,846
Yeah, l think you could say that.

372
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,208
Did he strike the little girl?

373
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:46,804
Did he strike you?

374
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,171
Not exactly.

375
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:51,771
Not exactly?

376
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:57,206
You know, there were times. . .

377
00:33:57,532 --> 00:33:59,523
. . .when l thought he was going to. . .

378
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:03,048
. . .but l just didn't want to wait
until he got around to it.

379
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:09,803
lt's hard to explain.

380
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,369
He could, l think.

381
00:34:14,892 --> 00:34:15,802
You think?

382
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:22,284
Hello, sir.
How are you today?

383
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:23,727
l'm doing all right.

384
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:25,883
- How about you?
- Me? l'm terrible.

385
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:27,002
l'm sorry.

386
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:30,966
l came from Santa Barbara,
and my friend wasn't home. . .

387
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,241
. . .and he owes me money. . .

388
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:34,448
. . .so l have no money to go home.

389
00:35:34,692 --> 00:35:37,365
l'm almost out of gas.
l had to sleep in my car.

390
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:40,450
Do you have a few bucks?
lt would really help me out.

391
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:43,405
Give me your address,
l'll mail it back. Honest.

392
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:46,652
- Let me see your driver's license.
- What for?

393
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,769
lt'll have your address on it.

394
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:52,089
- l don't have a license.
- You drove all the way without it?

395
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:53,486
Are you a cop?

396
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:55,848
Let's see your car registration
and your car.

397
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:59,801
All right, forget it.
Okay, just forget it!

398
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,447
That's a hell of a way
to treat a vet, man.

399
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:08,724
- You're an animal doctor?
- No, a veteran. l was in Nam.

400
00:36:09,212 --> 00:36:11,282
You must've been 1 0 years old.

401
00:36:11,492 --> 00:36:13,722
l meant to say the Gulf.

402
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,805
Come on! All l'm asking for
is a little change.

403
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:19,731
l haven't eaten in three days.

404
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,208
Well, l mean, except for this.

405
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:26,281
Fuck it! Give me some money, man.
Just give me some money.

406
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:29,242
How about a dime?
Give it to me.

407
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:30,771
l'm not giving you any.

408
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:32,650
- You got a cigarette?
- No.

409
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:36,083
- You gotta give me something.
- Why don't you get a job?

410
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,608
This is my park. l live here!

411
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:41,889
Who are you, walking
through my park with two bags?

412
00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:44,208
l don't got any. ls that fair?

413
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,330
What's in those bags, anyway?
Give me one.

414
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,769
l could sell those bags
and eat for a week with the money.

415
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:53,685
You've got two of them.
Why do you need two?

416
00:36:54,372 --> 00:36:55,805
You're right.

417
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,161
Here.

418
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:00,006
- Are you serious?
- l don't need it anymore.

419
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:06,131
All right! Come on, now.
Come on. What the--

420
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,601
Son of a bitch!

421
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:22,289
- Can we cut the crap this time?
- l'm telling you the truth!

422
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,811
Yeah, right.

423
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,810
- What's up?
- She was at the drive-by shooting.

424
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:33,447
- Angie, who hit your guys?
- l told you.

425
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:37,042
We know. The big bad white man.
We're not buying it.

426
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:39,004
Who are you protecting?

427
00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:43,009
They put your boyfriend in the hospital.
He's probably dead.

428
00:37:43,212 --> 00:37:45,851
Do you realize that?
He's probably fucking dead!

429
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:49,204
- Stop saying that!
- You picked a good day to leave.

430
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:52,365
You want another 3-year-old
to get shot in the head?

431
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,005
ls that what you want?

432
00:37:58,452 --> 00:37:59,680
Tell me the truth!

433
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,607
l'm telling you the truth!

434
00:38:03,652 --> 00:38:04,721
lt was a white guy!

435
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:08,169
- Why would he go after your friends?
- l don't know!

436
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:12,081
He attacked them on Angel's Flight Hill
with a baseball bat!

437
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,209
A baseball bat?
Wait!

438
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:18,002
Baseball bat.
What did this guy look like?

439
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:21,042
l don't know.
He looked like you. . .

440
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:22,964
. . .except he was taller and had hair.

441
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:24,964
Good description, Angie!

442
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:26,930
Did he wear a white shirt and tie?

443
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:31,520
Come over here, will you?

444
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:35,763
We gotta keep the pressure on her.
Don't interrupt.

445
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:37,041
What about the bat?

446
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:40,170
- The white shirt and tie!
- What will she think of next?

447
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:42,283
l'm sorry you're leaving,
but you are.

448
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:46,405
- Sanchez, listen to me!
- Check me later, babe.

449
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:55,648
Remember that storekeeper,
the Korean guy?

450
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:57,285
- Mr. Lee?
- Come here.

451
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,604
Where was his place?

452
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,486
Right there.

453
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:03,803
He was assaulted
sometime after 8 a.m.?

454
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:07,840
- About that.
- And the drive-by was here, right?

455
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:08,888
What's going on?

456
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:13,244
l may be nuts, but Angel's Flight Hill
is between those two spots.

457
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:16,768
- lt was a classy neighborhood.
- lt's a shit hole. Gangland.

458
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:21,170
l know. What would a white guy
in a shirt and tie be doing in. . .

459
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:22,680
. . .gangland?

460
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:38,366
Hi. Can l help you?

461
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:42,560
l'd like a ham and cheese Whamlette,
an order of Wham fries--

462
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:46,009
Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast.
We're on the lunch menu.

463
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:47,841
l want breakfast.

464
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:49,810
We're not serving it.

465
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:52,330
So you said.

466
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:54,641
ls that the manager?

467
00:39:56,252 --> 00:39:57,765
Could l speak to him, please?

468
00:39:58,892 --> 00:39:59,881
Sure.

469
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:02,646
Rick, a customer would like
to speak to you.

470
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:05,928
Yes, sir.

471
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:07,730
l'd like some breakfast.

472
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,283
We stopped serving breakfast.

473
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:15,407
l know you stopped breakfast, Rick.
Sheila told me you stopped. . . .

474
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:18,691
Why am l calling you by first names?
l don't know you.

475
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:23,363
l call my boss "mister" after 7 years,
but l walk in here, a stranger. . .

476
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:27,605
. . .and l'm calling you Rick and Sheila
like we're in an AA meeting.

477
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:32,281
l don't want to be your buddy, Rick.
l just want a little breakfast.

478
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:35,046
You can call me Miss Folsom
if you want to.

479
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:38,090
We stopped serving breakfast at 1 1 :30.

480
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:53,125
Have you ever heard the expression,
"The customer is always right"?

481
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:58,172
Well, here l am.

482
00:40:58,892 --> 00:41:00,610
The customer.

483
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:02,565
That's not our policy.

484
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:05,809
You have to order something
from the lunch menu.

485
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:09,282
l don't want lunch.

486
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:10,811
l want breakfast.

487
00:41:11,212 --> 00:41:13,521
Yeah, well, hey,
l'm really sorry.

488
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,081
Yeah, well, hey,
l'm really sorry too!

489
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:17,606
He's got a gun!

490
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:19,688
Let's get organized!

491
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:21,362
Calm down!

492
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,365
Just calm down, everybody.
Sit down over there!

493
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:27,005
Mister.

494
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,645
Where are you going?

495
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:32,730
No. You sit down there,
and you finish your lunch.

496
00:41:33,092 --> 00:41:36,721
Everybody just relax
and take it easy.

497
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:40,410
Eat your lunch. Please.

498
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:42,603
You all need your vitamins A, B and--

499
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:46,802
Don't! lt was an accident!

500
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:50,243
lt's the trigger. lt's sensitive.
lt's okay!

501
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:54,410
lt's a sensitive trigger.

502
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:00,565
Could l have my breakfast?

503
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,803
Yes, sir. Sheila?

504
00:42:10,972 --> 00:42:13,440
Rick? Miss Folsom?

505
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:15,280
You know what?

506
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,329
You were right.
l've changed my mind.

507
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:19,723
l'm going to have some lunch.

508
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:23,164
Could l have a double
Whammyburger with cheese--

509
00:42:23,492 --> 00:42:25,608
- You getting this?
- Yes, sir.

510
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:29,242
And an order of Whammy fries
and, let's see. . .

511
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:30,971
. . .a Choco-Wham shake.

512
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:33,647
Yes, sir.
Sheila, get his order.

513
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:35,969
Rick, could you
get it for me, please?

514
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:41,602
l feel comfortable calling you Rick
after all we've been through together.

515
00:42:46,892 --> 00:42:48,371
How you doing?

516
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:50,804
Enjoying your meal?

517
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:53,922
How about you?

518
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:55,611
ls it good?

519
00:42:59,492 --> 00:43:01,289
And you, ma'am? How's the food?

520
00:43:03,812 --> 00:43:05,370
l think we have a critic.

521
00:43:07,692 --> 00:43:10,411
l don't think
she likes the special sauce.

522
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:13,805
That's a joke.

523
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,205
Now, here we go.

524
00:43:16,692 --> 00:43:17,681
Thank you.

525
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:23,608
See, this is what l'm talking about.

526
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:25,128
Look at that.

527
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:26,568
See what l mean?

528
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,967
lt's plump, juicy, three inches thick.

529
00:43:32,772 --> 00:43:36,526
Look at this sorry,
miserable, squashed thing.

530
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:40,164
Can anybody tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

531
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:43,004
Anybody?

532
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:45,604
Anybody at all.

533
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,764
You guys are partners again!

534
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:01,123
No such luck, Lita.
He's moving to Lake Havasu.

535
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:04,012
- What's in Lake Havasu?
- London Bridge.

536
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:07,403
- Are you going to England?
- They moved it to Arizona.

537
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:10,843
- Stone by stone.
- Oh, yeah. l heard about that.

538
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:13,845
You're better off,
because cops get killed.

539
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,522
- What did we used to get, six?
- Seven.

540
00:44:16,812 --> 00:44:18,404
Two sevens.

541
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:24,128
You all right?

542
00:44:27,572 --> 00:44:28,846
You sure?

543
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,652
l'm sorry, l wasn't gonna do this.

544
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:41,360
l should just shut up.
lt's none of my business.

545
00:44:41,572 --> 00:44:43,005
Tell me.

546
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:45,923
Lake Havasu?

547
00:44:47,012 --> 00:44:48,445
lt's nice. We like it.

548
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:49,920
She likes it.

549
00:44:50,492 --> 00:44:52,210
What'll you do, watch cactus grow?

550
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:53,846
Cacti.

551
00:44:57,052 --> 00:44:59,122
She's not handling
middle age too well.

552
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:02,967
The change of life and all that,
whatever it is that is.

553
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:05,281
What about you?

554
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:08,211
Me? lt's different,
because she's a woman.

555
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:10,521
Different? l'm a woman.

556
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:12,849
But she was once very beautiful.

557
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:15,607
Thanks a lot!

558
00:45:15,852 --> 00:45:18,446
You know what l mean.
Come on, come on.

559
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:21,120
She could've been anything.
Anything but a cop's wife.

560
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:22,361
She's high-strung.

561
00:45:22,572 --> 00:45:26,406
Don't give me that queen of the hop,
homecoming-queen bullshit again.

562
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,411
That was a long time ago.

563
00:45:29,252 --> 00:45:31,243
Sandra, you have a career.

564
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:34,650
lt's hard to lose your beauty
when that's all you've got.

565
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:36,126
What about your career?

566
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:38,650
l'll be okay. . .

567
00:45:38,892 --> 00:45:41,008
. . .you know, even without you.

568
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:48,161
Sorry to break this up.

569
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,403
- Why are you here?
- We got a call.

570
00:45:50,612 --> 00:45:52,011
Watch out! Hot plates!

571
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,886
- Don't touch my gun.
- Fuck you!

572
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:58,323
You'll love this one. Some
dickhead went into Whammyburger. . .

573
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:00,961
. . .pulled out a gun
when he couldn't get breakfast.

574
00:46:01,212 --> 00:46:03,601
Then he paid for it and left.

575
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:04,921
Sorry, Prendergast.

576
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:06,002
He paid for it?

577
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:08,291
Move your buns. Let's go.

578
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:09,402
l gotta go.

579
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:10,801
Where was this?

580
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:13,651
Quintero and Fourth.
Bye, ladies.

581
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:17,001
Wait a minute. Wait, wait!

582
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:20,409
Let me know what this guy
was wearing, okay?

583
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:24,491
You trying to crack a big one
before you disappear into the desert?

584
00:46:24,732 --> 00:46:27,849
Sandra, find out if he's wearing
a white shirt and tie.

585
00:46:28,092 --> 00:46:29,491
Let's go, lovebirds.

586
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:31,410
- l gotta go.
- Wait.

587
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,966
Something about my wife.
Maybe l never mentioned it.

588
00:46:36,772 --> 00:46:37,807
What?

589
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:42,004
l love her.

590
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:44,809
Let's go!

591
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:12,844
For seven years, l banked here.

592
00:47:13,092 --> 00:47:16,607
When l asked them for a loan,
a small loan. . .

593
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:20,646
. . .they told me that l was not
"economically viable. "

594
00:47:29,652 --> 00:47:31,688
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

595
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,605
How'd your loan work out?
Did they give you a loan?

596
00:47:35,892 --> 00:47:37,644
He must be economically viable!

597
00:47:37,892 --> 00:47:40,850
There's a man with a smiling face.
A happy customer.

598
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:44,608
That's what an economically
viable person looks like!

599
00:47:56,092 --> 00:47:57,605
How much is the. . .?

600
00:47:58,052 --> 00:47:59,804
That is only $3.

601
00:48:03,892 --> 00:48:06,850
l asked them for a small loan.
You know what they told me?

602
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,526
l was not economically viable.

603
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:11,688
That's enough.

604
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:15,809
- l'll buy this.
- Yes, sir. That is $3.

605
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:27,282
l'm going away now!
l'm going away, everybody!

606
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:32,202
This is what happens
if you're not economically viable!

607
00:48:42,492 --> 00:48:44,244
Don't let this happen to you!

608
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:46,691
Bye, everybody!

609
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:52,688
Don't forget me.

610
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:13,207
l'm sorry.

611
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:15,727
We're leaving now.

612
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:17,401
You are? Really?

613
00:49:17,612 --> 00:49:20,251
lt doesn't look like
your husband's gonna show.

614
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:25,122
He probably realized he could get
into trouble if he harassed you.

615
00:49:25,452 --> 00:49:28,410
You should call your lawyer
and tell him about it.

616
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:32,048
lt's one of those services.
l didn't have much money.

617
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:36,080
Have them call your husband's lawyer,
make it official.

618
00:49:36,612 --> 00:49:41,003
ln the meantime, lock up.
And if anything else happens, call us.

619
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:43,601
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure thing.

620
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:59,367
Excuse me. Hey, excuse me!

621
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:03,446
lf you haven't noticed,
others are waiting to use the phone.

622
00:50:03,852 --> 00:50:06,047
- Others want the phone?
- Right, asshole!

623
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:09,409
Jeez, that's too bad,
because you know what?

624
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,803
l think it's out of order.

625
00:50:27,412 --> 00:50:28,527
Hi, it's me.

626
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:31,081
He's eating and resting
comfortably now.

627
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:32,441
- Who is?
- Mr. Peepers.

628
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:34,449
- Good!
- l'm sorry about before.

629
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:36,643
l really blew my top. . . .

630
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:39,645
That's okay, honey.
Could you hold on one second?

631
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:42,007
White shirt and tie.

632
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:43,401
Could you hold on?

633
00:50:43,652 --> 00:50:44,687
l gotta go.

634
00:50:44,932 --> 00:50:47,730
Just one second.
lt's very important.

635
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:50,806
Detective Torres!
Excuse me.

636
00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:54,249
We have about 7 million people
waiting to make a statement.

637
00:50:55,492 --> 00:50:56,891
Let me call you right back.

638
00:50:57,132 --> 00:50:58,770
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

639
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:01,685
Nothing's wrong.
What do you mean?

640
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,367
- You come home then.
- I can 't.

641
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:07,524
lt's your last day.
What are they going to do, fire you?

642
00:51:07,772 --> 00:51:11,162
There's a lot of red tape.
As soon as l get done, l can go home.

643
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:13,442
l'll call you in a while, okay?

644
00:51:13,692 --> 00:51:15,648
Wait a minute. Make a list.

645
00:51:15,892 --> 00:51:18,167
- A list?
- We need boneless chicken...

646
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:19,731
. . .skinless. Red peppers. . .

647
00:51:19,972 --> 00:51:21,451
...not green, red.

648
00:51:21,652 --> 00:51:23,483
Honey, hold on one second.

649
00:51:24,532 --> 00:51:26,284
l am tying up the phone here.

650
00:51:26,652 --> 00:51:29,007
Just listen for once in your life.

651
00:51:29,852 --> 00:51:32,764
A girl at the drive-by said
a man in a shirt and tie...

652
00:51:33,012 --> 00:51:35,810
. . .attacked her homeboys
with a baseball bat.

653
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:38,003
Somebody's let that dog off the leash.

654
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:40,564
l think you've got last-day-itis.

655
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:45,084
This man was not swinging a bat.
He has a gym bag full of guns.

656
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,171
A gym bag?

657
00:51:48,132 --> 00:51:50,771
You asked me to tell you
what he wore. l gotta run.

658
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:52,650
We have to canvas the neighborhood.

659
00:51:52,892 --> 00:51:54,325
One more second.

660
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,931
Please. lt's important.

661
00:51:57,252 --> 00:51:59,527
- Why don 't you go to the store?
- Why?

662
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:01,171
lt's my last day.

663
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:04,210
The guys might want to have
a send off or something.

664
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:06,522
What're they gonna do?
Get some broad. . .

665
00:52:06,772 --> 00:52:09,411
... with tassels dangling,
dancing on your desk?

666
00:52:09,612 --> 00:52:11,284
Course not.

667
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:14,365
Look, while you have
been playing cop. . .

668
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:17,040
. . .l'm at home
planning your retirement.

669
00:52:17,252 --> 00:52:19,925
lt's over. The sooner
you get that, the better.

670
00:52:20,692 --> 00:52:23,968
You are no longer
in the law-enforcement business.

671
00:52:24,212 --> 00:52:27,409
Now, l will expect you
at the usual time. Capito ?

672
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:31,686
Sandra, are you mad at me?

673
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,160
- l hate you, but l'm not mad.
- You retiring too?

674
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:42,365
Just don't leave
without saying goodbye.

675
00:52:42,652 --> 00:52:43,880
Goodbye.

676
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:46,641
lf you go up against this guy. . .

677
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:48,208
. . .be careful.

678
00:54:09,972 --> 00:54:11,405
l'm Nick.

679
00:54:12,652 --> 00:54:14,290
What can l do you for?

680
00:54:14,492 --> 00:54:16,562
l'm just looking for
some hiking boots.

681
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:19,372
Well, well. Hiking boots, huh?

682
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:21,842
Let's see what we got.

683
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:23,690
These are the top of the line.

684
00:54:23,892 --> 00:54:26,690
Scientifically engineered
and all that crap.

685
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:30,282
Guaranteed by some Sierra Club
asshole not to hurt a chipmunk. . .

686
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:32,244
. . .if you step on it.

687
00:54:32,452 --> 00:54:35,125
Personally, l think they're
for pussies and faggots!

688
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:37,971
Now these. . .

689
00:54:38,412 --> 00:54:40,084
. . .are Vietnam jungle boots.

690
00:54:40,692 --> 00:54:43,968
Cost half as much,
last twice as long and are great. . .

691
00:54:44,212 --> 00:54:46,089
. . .for stomping queers!

692
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:50,205
When you're done, you gotta
clean out the waffle with a stick. . .

693
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,841
. . .but you can't
have everything, right?

694
00:54:53,852 --> 00:54:55,205
Forget it.

695
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,520
Come on, let's go.

696
00:54:57,772 --> 00:55:00,206
Have a nice day, fellas!

697
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:02,682
Y'all come back now, you hear?

698
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:04,765
You got a problem, buddy?

699
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,441
You got the problem!

700
00:55:10,652 --> 00:55:13,041
- No, you do, buddy!
- Read the sign!

701
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:15,089
"l reserve the right. "

702
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:17,120
Now take a hike.

703
00:55:17,572 --> 00:55:19,005
Make me.

704
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:23,602
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.

705
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:27,126
- Jesus!
- Come on, make your play.

706
00:55:27,412 --> 00:55:30,802
Would you just come on!
l don't need this shit today.

707
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:33,080
Fucking redneck!

708
00:55:34,652 --> 00:55:35,880
Fascist!

709
00:55:39,892 --> 00:55:42,087
Fucking faggots!

710
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:44,044
You believe this shit?

711
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:47,209
Jesus!

712
00:55:47,852 --> 00:55:50,605
Alternate lifestyle, my ass!

713
00:55:51,812 --> 00:55:55,248
lmagine what those pumpkins do
with each other when they're alone!

714
00:55:55,612 --> 00:55:59,287
And what about the muff divers?
Think about it.

715
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:03,328
Sergeant Prendergast.

716
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:04,721
She don't have to talk!

717
00:56:06,092 --> 00:56:08,606
What do you want?
l admitted it was a gang!

718
00:56:08,852 --> 00:56:10,524
She don't have to say a word!

719
00:56:10,892 --> 00:56:15,408
l know it was a white guy.
We gotta talk. lt's important.

720
00:56:17,972 --> 00:56:21,044
How many guns were in the gym bag?

721
00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:24,728
l don't know what you're talking about.
l didn't see no gym bag!

722
00:56:25,252 --> 00:56:28,324
The white guy took it, right?
More people could get hurt.

723
00:56:28,572 --> 00:56:30,005
Now help me out.

724
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:35,045
The bag was already in the car
when l got in.

725
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,691
How many guns were in it?

726
00:56:36,892 --> 00:56:38,291
l don't know.

727
00:56:40,212 --> 00:56:42,009
Lots of guns.

728
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,642
They got all the guns
in the fucking world.

729
00:57:08,372 --> 00:57:09,361
Good?

730
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:15,488
Can l help you?

731
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,882
Police officer.
l'm looking for a man.

732
00:57:18,452 --> 00:57:20,010
Are you now?

733
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:21,967
Late 30s. . .

734
00:57:22,492 --> 00:57:23,641
. . .white shirt and tie. . .

735
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:26,608
. . .he'd be carrying a gym bag.

736
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:33,770
What's the police scanner for?

737
00:57:34,612 --> 00:57:36,284
My own personal amusement.

738
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:39,729
Seen anyone like l've described?

739
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:40,922
Nope.

740
00:57:41,652 --> 00:57:43,608
- Okay, thanks.
- Listen.

741
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:45,604
Tell me something.

742
00:57:46,012 --> 00:57:48,082
Why don't they call you guys. . .

743
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:50,567
. . .officer-esses?

744
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,161
l beg your pardon?

745
00:57:52,372 --> 00:57:56,206
You know, like actress?
Like that?

746
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:00,528
Something to signify. . .

747
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:03,005
. . .you know.

748
00:58:05,372 --> 00:58:09,001
l guess they feel that a police officer
is a police officer. . .

749
00:58:09,212 --> 00:58:10,884
. . .not a. . .

750
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:13,205
. . . "you know. "

751
00:58:14,612 --> 00:58:16,489
Thanks for your cooperation, sir.

752
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:19,968
Sorry l couldn't be of
more help, officer-ess.

753
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:30,007
Why'd you do that?

754
00:58:30,612 --> 00:58:32,762
There's something l wanna show you.

755
00:58:33,652 --> 00:58:36,928
l'm not gonna turn you in.
l'm your friend.

756
00:58:37,812 --> 00:58:39,006
Come on.

757
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:42,561
l don't bring just anybody back here.

758
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:45,411
This is my own private stash.

759
00:58:46,092 --> 00:58:48,401
l got some great stuff here.

760
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:56,123
World War l. Good shape.

761
00:58:57,452 --> 00:58:59,727
Speaking of gas, wait a minute.

762
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:01,803
Wait just a minute.

763
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:13,403
You know what was in this?

764
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:15,444
Zyklon-B.

765
00:59:16,412 --> 00:59:17,606
You remember?

766
00:59:17,812 --> 00:59:18,927
What the Nazis had?

767
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:22,327
Listen.

768
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:26,281
Empty.

769
00:59:26,852 --> 00:59:28,171
This was used, man.

770
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:31,810
This was actually used.

771
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:36,604
l wonder how many kikes
this little can took out.

772
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:40,046
Think about it. Here.

773
00:59:45,692 --> 00:59:47,808
Why are you showing me this?

774
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:49,208
l'm not.

775
00:59:50,492 --> 00:59:53,211
That's just for fun.
You can keep that.

776
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,440
This is what l want to show you.

777
00:59:59,212 --> 01:00:01,043
The real thing.

778
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:05,249
Heat-seeking, shoulder-fired.
lt's fucking disposable!

779
01:00:05,452 --> 01:00:08,012
You can take out a jet
with one of these monkeys.

780
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:11,610
lt's for you.

781
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:13,803
l want you to have it.

782
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:15,128
Why?

783
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:17,404
Because l'm with you.

784
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:19,040
Don't you get it?

785
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:22,125
l listened to the scanner.
l heard about Whammyburger.

786
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,966
Fucking fantastic!

787
01:00:25,172 --> 01:00:29,404
lt's a bunch of niggers, right?
On TV, it's always white kids.

788
01:00:29,612 --> 01:00:32,922
But when you go in there,
it's nothing but a bunch of niggers!

789
01:00:33,412 --> 01:00:35,972
They'll spit on your food
if you're not nice.

790
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:38,128
l know all about it.

791
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:41,045
l'm with you.

792
01:00:41,252 --> 01:00:43,561
We're the same, you and me.

793
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:45,444
We're the same. Don't you see?

794
01:00:45,652 --> 01:00:48,007
We are not the same.

795
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:50,931
l'm an American.
You're a sick asshole.

796
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:55,164
What kind of vigilante are you?

797
01:00:55,492 --> 01:00:58,086
l am not a vigilante.

798
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:01,489
l'm just trying to get home
for my little girl's birthday.

799
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:06,607
And if everybody will stay
out of my way, nobody will get hurt.

800
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,725
Fuck you!

801
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:11,611
Who the fuck are you?
Are you fucking with me?

802
01:01:11,812 --> 01:01:14,372
l am just disagreeing with you!

803
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:18,690
ln America, we have freedom of speech,
the right to disagree!

804
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:20,843
Fuck you and your freedom!

805
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,644
Who the fuck are you?

806
01:01:22,852 --> 01:01:24,888
You fuck!
You faggot fuck!

807
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:26,445
Gonna take my rocket.

808
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:30,042
l ought to shoot you, motherfucker!
Now turn around!

809
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:32,760
Now lean on that counter!
Go on, lean on it!

810
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:41,008
Look at this shit!

811
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:46,408
What is this doing in there?

812
01:01:46,612 --> 01:01:48,603
Faggot shit!

813
01:01:50,892 --> 01:01:54,680
You want freedom, huh?
l'll give you fucking freedom!

814
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:57,452
Further back.
Feet farther back.

815
01:01:58,052 --> 01:02:00,282
Spread them out.
Farther.

816
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,209
You're going to jail, motherfucker!
How's that for freedom?

817
01:02:04,412 --> 01:02:07,370
Freedom to get fucked up the ass
by some big buck nigger.

818
01:02:07,612 --> 01:02:08,806
Give me your hand.

819
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:16,930
He's gonna be right behind you,
just like this.

820
01:02:18,092 --> 01:02:21,164
Think about it.
You gonna like that, faggot?

821
01:02:21,412 --> 01:02:25,246
You gonna like that, you faggot fuck?
Give me your other hand.

822
01:02:25,612 --> 01:02:27,409
- l can't.
- Why not?

823
01:02:27,612 --> 01:02:28,522
Gravity.

824
01:02:28,732 --> 01:02:31,007
Gravity?
What the fuck does that mean?

825
01:02:31,212 --> 01:02:32,725
l'll fall down.

826
01:02:35,212 --> 01:02:37,646
Now give me your other hand!
Give it to me now!

827
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,049
Give it to me! Give it to me!

828
01:02:40,412 --> 01:02:41,401
Come on. Come on.

829
01:02:41,772 --> 01:02:43,285
Give it to me.

830
01:03:02,372 --> 01:03:04,010
This isn't one of mine.

831
01:03:19,572 --> 01:03:21,449
Oh, my God!

832
01:03:21,652 --> 01:03:23,483
Oh, my God!

833
01:03:24,892 --> 01:03:25,688
Good!

834
01:03:26,292 --> 01:03:27,566
Freedom of religion.

835
01:03:28,212 --> 01:03:29,486
Now you get the swing of it!

836
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:32,283
Feels good to exercise your rights.

837
01:03:44,812 --> 01:03:45,881
l'm listening.

838
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:48,686
We got a nutcase
with a bag full of guns.

839
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:51,326
He's in Hollywood, heading west.

840
01:03:51,532 --> 01:03:52,647
What is he up to?

841
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:54,928
He's up to a lot of trouble.

842
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:58,681
Never mind, we've got
a hallway full of suspects.

843
01:03:58,892 --> 01:04:01,452
lt wasn't a gang thing.
l can tell you that.

844
01:04:01,692 --> 01:04:03,683
Angelina is a tramp and a liar.

845
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:07,163
We don't appreciate you interfering
with our investigation.

846
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:11,530
l've got a positive l.D.
on the gym bag, okay?

847
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:15,325
What's this?

848
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:16,760
A gym bag.

849
01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:19,930
Does this mean you're
putting me under arrest?

850
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:24,124
You guys take off.

851
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,881
l gave you that speech earlier. . .

852
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,442
. . .because that's regulations.
They make me do it.

853
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:36,326
This one's from me.
l've never liked you.

854
01:04:36,532 --> 01:04:40,445
You know why? You don't curse.
l don't trust a man who doesn't curse.

855
01:04:40,692 --> 01:04:45,163
Not a "fuck" or a "shit" in all
these years. Real men curse.

856
01:04:45,572 --> 01:04:48,405
And l don't like a man
who's afraid to hit the street.

857
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:51,046
- lt's bad for morale.
- l'm not afraid.

858
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:53,522
Get back behind that desk
where you belong. . .

859
01:04:53,812 --> 01:04:57,521
. . .and don't waste any more of my time
pretending you're a cop.

860
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:07,610
A man in a white shirt and tie shot up
a phone booth near the Whammyburger.

861
01:05:08,532 --> 01:05:11,126
- Did you hear me?
- l heard you.

862
01:05:11,932 --> 01:05:13,968
Right about here, right?

863
01:05:14,292 --> 01:05:15,771
How did you know?

864
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,128
He got the bag of guns
at the drive-by.

865
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:19,606
Then you were right.

866
01:05:19,812 --> 01:05:20,961
Excuse me.

867
01:05:21,172 --> 01:05:23,686
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

868
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:26,690
l'm a coward, the captain told me.
Get out of my way.

869
01:05:26,892 --> 01:05:28,769
Hey, look. lt is your own fault.

870
01:05:29,212 --> 01:05:31,806
You let everybody think that,
when it was your wife.

871
01:05:32,372 --> 01:05:34,010
She made you get off the street.

872
01:05:34,252 --> 01:05:38,211
What happens between me and my wife
is nobody's business but mine!

873
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:40,530
Sorry, l've been a bitch all day.

874
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:43,565
She didn't make me quit.
l came home late one night. . .

875
01:05:43,812 --> 01:05:45,803
. . .and found her sitting in the dark.

876
01:05:46,052 --> 01:05:47,644
She thought l'd been killed.

877
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:51,282
She thought l was a ghost.
l had to chase her all over the house.

878
01:05:53,852 --> 01:05:56,320
- l'm sorry.
- Forget it.

879
01:05:57,012 --> 01:06:00,049
- Where are you going?
- See if l can earn my last day's pay.

880
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:01,924
Let me go with you.

881
01:06:03,012 --> 01:06:04,923
l thought you were on duty.

882
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:09,530
What do you say, partner?

883
01:06:11,812 --> 01:06:12,881
Fuck them!

884
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:16,407
Go!

885
01:06:30,332 --> 01:06:32,926
Who were you talking to a while ago?

886
01:06:35,732 --> 01:06:37,165
You're trying to scare me.

887
01:06:38,892 --> 01:06:39,802
Am l succeeding?

888
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:43,721
No, you're not succeeding.
So you just might as well stop it.

889
01:06:44,732 --> 01:06:47,485
And you're not scaring me
out of my own house.

890
01:06:47,692 --> 01:06:48,886
And you're not coming here.

891
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:53,529
But l am. l'm on my way.
You can count on that.

892
01:06:55,532 --> 01:06:58,126
l'm past the point of no return.

893
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:01,529
Do you know when that is?

894
01:07:02,612 --> 01:07:05,206
That's the point in a journey. . .

895
01:07:05,412 --> 01:07:08,210
. . .where it's longer to go back
to the beginning. . .

896
01:07:08,452 --> 01:07:11,012
. . .than it is to continue
to the end.

897
01:07:12,492 --> 01:07:13,925
lt's like. . . .

898
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:16,801
Remember when those
astronauts got in trouble?

899
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:20,527
They were going to the moon
and something went wrong.

900
01:07:20,772 --> 01:07:22,205
They had to get back to Earth. . .

901
01:07:22,412 --> 01:07:25,609
. . .but they had passed
the point of no return.

902
01:07:26,412 --> 01:07:30,564
So they had to go all the way
around the moon to get back...

903
01:07:30,772 --> 01:07:34,811
...and they were
out of contact for hours.

904
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:39,608
Everybody waited to see
if a bunch of dead guys in a can. . .

905
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:41,928
. . .would pop out the other side.

906
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:47,131
That's me.

907
01:07:48,612 --> 01:07:50,921
On the other side of the moon now. . .

908
01:07:51,332 --> 01:07:53,323
. . .out of contact. . .

909
01:07:54,332 --> 01:07:58,041
. . .and everybody's just going
to have to wait till l pop out.

910
01:08:01,012 --> 01:08:02,730
The police are here.

911
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:06,045
Did you know, Beth...

912
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:10,366
. . .that in certain South American
countries it's still legal. . .

913
01:08:10,612 --> 01:08:13,206
. . .to kill your wife
if she insults you?

914
01:08:16,332 --> 01:08:19,165
They're here right now.
l'm looking at one right now.

915
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:20,847
Put him on the phone.

916
01:08:37,412 --> 01:08:40,529
- What are we gonna do?
- Talk to the Korean guy.

917
01:08:41,812 --> 01:08:44,326
Then we just start banging on doors.

918
01:08:56,012 --> 01:08:57,331
What is it?

919
01:09:00,812 --> 01:09:02,723
Where are you going?

920
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:04,524
l'll be right back.

921
01:09:06,412 --> 01:09:09,722
l'm sure the guy will
let you use his bathroom.

922
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:24,603
Prendergast, what are you doing?

923
01:09:35,492 --> 01:09:36,720
l know who this guy is!

924
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:37,768
Who is he?

925
01:09:38,772 --> 01:09:41,969
He had a personalized license plate.
What the hell was it?

926
01:09:42,172 --> 01:09:44,208
lt said, "D-Fens. "

927
01:09:44,732 --> 01:09:45,528
Defense?

928
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:49,608
D-dash-F-E-N-S.
"D-Fens. "

929
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:53,487
They said he was on his way home.
Go check out his address.

930
01:09:54,132 --> 01:09:54,962
Mr. Lee!

931
01:09:56,412 --> 01:09:57,891
Defense!

932
01:10:24,412 --> 01:10:25,970
Hold it! Back up.

933
01:10:29,612 --> 01:10:32,570
You dumb bitch! You cut me off!
What's wrong with you!

934
01:10:32,772 --> 01:10:34,364
Move back! Out of the way!

935
01:10:34,572 --> 01:10:35,971
What are you, a moron?

936
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:40,922
lf l wanted to be in a parking lot,
l'd buy a ticket, you dumb bitch!

937
01:10:59,612 --> 01:11:01,443
You can't come this way.

938
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,207
What are you doing?

939
01:11:03,612 --> 01:11:05,762
Fixing the street!
What does it look like?

940
01:11:07,372 --> 01:11:09,169
Two days ago, it was fine.

941
01:11:09,412 --> 01:11:11,528
You're saying
it fell apart in two days?

942
01:11:12,012 --> 01:11:13,809
Well, l guess so.

943
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:16,645
Pardon me, but that's bullshit!

944
01:11:17,412 --> 01:11:20,722
l don't think anything's
wrong with the street.

945
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:23,008
You're trying
to justify your budgets.

946
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,009
- Are you nuts?
- l know how it works.

947
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:29,287
lf you don't spend your budget,
you won't get any money next year.

948
01:11:29,772 --> 01:11:32,445
l want you to admit
nothing's wrong with the street!

949
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:34,006
Fuck you, pal!

950
01:11:34,572 --> 01:11:38,929
You're not gonna hold us hostage with
these yellow lights and big trucks.

951
01:11:40,772 --> 01:11:43,809
l'm just here to keep people
from falling in. That's all.

952
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:46,123
l want to hear it from you.

953
01:11:47,212 --> 01:11:49,123
What's wrong with the street?

954
01:11:49,332 --> 01:11:52,563
l don't know. l really don't.
l think it's a sewer job.

955
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:55,330
You're lying.

956
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,803
What's wrong with the street?

957
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:01,048
Nothing.

958
01:12:03,412 --> 01:12:04,686
l knew it.

959
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:07,281
See, l knew it was fine.

960
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,928
But l'll give you something to fix.

961
01:12:11,892 --> 01:12:13,166
- Oh, Jesus--
- Here!

962
01:12:14,492 --> 01:12:16,801
Hey, Charlie!
Oh, please, man!

963
01:12:17,052 --> 01:12:19,008
We got a goddamn nut here!

964
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:23,162
Fucking guy back there with a bazooka!

965
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:24,361
Pull that thing off.

966
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:25,727
- What thing?
- That.

967
01:12:25,972 --> 01:12:28,440
Then pull on both ends.
lt gets bigger.

968
01:12:29,532 --> 01:12:30,567
Like this?

969
01:12:30,772 --> 01:12:33,525
Now flip that thing up.
lt's your aimer.

970
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:34,688
How do you know?

971
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,610
l saw it on TV.

972
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:38,689
What's the name of the movie?

973
01:12:38,932 --> 01:12:40,923
What's the movie you're making?

974
01:12:42,572 --> 01:12:44,449
Under Construction. You like it?

975
01:12:44,692 --> 01:12:46,762
lt's all right.
Where's the cameras?

976
01:12:47,132 --> 01:12:49,726
The cameras are on.
Just stand back.

977
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:53,330
What do l do now?

978
01:12:53,532 --> 01:12:57,605
Just look through the aimer.
What you aiming at?

979
01:12:59,372 --> 01:13:01,328
That yellow monster down there.

980
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:04,851
Look at it and pull the trigger.
lt's really easy.

981
01:13:05,892 --> 01:13:06,688
Trigger?

982
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:09,923
That one right there.

983
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:12,528
But aim first, man.

984
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:15,131
Look out!

985
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:24,321
- Nothing happened.
- Must have been a dud or something.

986
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:37,326
Cool, man!

987
01:13:48,212 --> 01:13:49,611
What is it?
l'll sic the dog on you!

988
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:51,924
Police officers, ma'am.

989
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,925
How are you?

990
01:14:05,492 --> 01:14:07,164
Where's the dog?

991
01:14:10,532 --> 01:14:12,124
He's dead.

992
01:14:13,812 --> 01:14:17,122
- What is it?
- We need to ask you some questions.

993
01:14:17,612 --> 01:14:19,603
Just a few questions, ma'am.

994
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:21,643
What kind of questions?

995
01:14:21,852 --> 01:14:23,570
Do you have a warrant?

996
01:14:23,772 --> 01:14:25,205
You invited us in.

997
01:14:25,412 --> 01:14:27,642
Now l'm inviting you out.

998
01:14:27,892 --> 01:14:30,201
What relation are you
to William Foster?

999
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:34,371
What are you saying? He's my son.
l don't want you here.

1000
01:14:34,572 --> 01:14:37,723
Would you look at this?
This is really amazing.

1001
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:38,762
Amazing!

1002
01:14:39,012 --> 01:14:42,721
Does he have another house,
another place he might call home?

1003
01:14:42,972 --> 01:14:44,371
Now this is a what?

1004
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:46,523
- A dragon?
- Don't touch that!

1005
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:50,722
Why would he do that?
This is his home.

1006
01:14:50,932 --> 01:14:53,765
- l want you to go now.
- Did this one melt?

1007
01:14:54,572 --> 01:14:55,721
That one.

1008
01:15:00,332 --> 01:15:03,130
lt's a giraffe, drinking.

1009
01:15:06,332 --> 01:15:09,324
Now, of all of these,
which is your very favorite?

1010
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:15,362
Right now, l think this skunk.

1011
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:17,125
That's lovely.

1012
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:19,327
That's not paint.

1013
01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:21,120
You know, his stripe.

1014
01:15:21,372 --> 01:15:22,248
lt isn't?

1015
01:15:22,492 --> 01:15:24,881
lt might be,
but it's not painted on.

1016
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,842
lt's in the glass.

1017
01:16:08,372 --> 01:16:10,090
What the hell?

1018
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:12,927
lt's the groundskeeper.

1019
01:16:13,172 --> 01:16:16,403
Well, if he is, he's out of uniform.
Hey, you there!

1020
01:16:17,012 --> 01:16:18,843
What are you doing there?

1021
01:16:19,412 --> 01:16:20,527
Just passing through.

1022
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:24,561
Nobody said you could play through.
Get off my hole.

1023
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:26,888
He said he was passing through.

1024
01:16:27,092 --> 01:16:29,003
He's not a member.
Look how he's dressed.

1025
01:16:29,212 --> 01:16:30,850
Get off my golf course!

1026
01:16:31,732 --> 01:16:32,881
l am!

1027
01:16:33,092 --> 01:16:34,844
Go back the way you came!

1028
01:16:35,212 --> 01:16:37,521
l don't like his looks.
Leave him alone.

1029
01:16:37,732 --> 01:16:40,292
What am l paying dues for?
This is my golf course!

1030
01:16:40,492 --> 01:16:42,960
lf l want to play here, l will!

1031
01:16:43,172 --> 01:16:45,970
lf he gets hit with my Titleist,
that's his problem!

1032
01:16:46,172 --> 01:16:48,811
Don't yell at me.
l'm just here playing with you--

1033
01:16:49,332 --> 01:16:50,651
Fore!

1034
01:16:52,052 --> 01:16:52,962
Fore!

1035
01:16:59,612 --> 01:17:00,408
Five!

1036
01:17:01,092 --> 01:17:02,002
Wait a minute!

1037
01:17:02,212 --> 01:17:05,887
What the hell you trying to do?
Kill me with a golf ball?

1038
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:09,170
lt's not enough you got all
this land for your little game?

1039
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:11,960
But you had to kill me
with a golf ball?

1040
01:17:12,612 --> 01:17:16,082
You should have children playing here.
Family picnics.

1041
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:18,203
You should have a petting zoo. . .

1042
01:17:19,012 --> 01:17:23,528
. . .instead of electric carts for you
old men with nothing better to do.

1043
01:17:29,532 --> 01:17:32,330
Frank, what's wrong? Frank!

1044
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:35,887
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1045
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:39,050
- l gotta get some help!
- What's wrong with you?

1046
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:41,248
- Help!
- Your heart?

1047
01:17:41,492 --> 01:17:44,245
Something's wrong with your heart?
What can l do?

1048
01:17:45,812 --> 01:17:47,450
Pills! Pills!

1049
01:17:47,732 --> 01:17:48,528
Pills?

1050
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:50,321
Where are they?

1051
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:52,571
Cart, cart.

1052
01:17:54,812 --> 01:17:58,566
Call the paramedics!
My friend just had a heart attack!

1053
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:02,521
l guess you're out of luck.
Your little cart's gonna drown.

1054
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:06,528
Aren't you sorry you didn't let me
pass through your golf course?

1055
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:13,522
Now you're gonna die wearing that
stupid little hat. How does it feel?

1056
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,322
This is his room.

1057
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:21,962
You're a very neat and tidy lady.

1058
01:18:22,212 --> 01:18:24,646
He cleans his own room.

1059
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:27,203
Now don't make me call you a liar.

1060
01:18:28,012 --> 01:18:32,290
lf he wasn't at work,
l'd be afraid to set foot in here.

1061
01:18:32,492 --> 01:18:34,084
What's he been doing lately?

1062
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,691
Same as ever.

1063
01:18:35,892 --> 01:18:39,521
Building important things to
protect us from the Communists.

1064
01:18:40,412 --> 01:18:41,811
He works at Notec.

1065
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:43,930
The defense plant.

1066
01:18:44,532 --> 01:18:46,011
D-Fens.

1067
01:18:47,132 --> 01:18:49,088
Call Notec and see if you can get him.

1068
01:18:53,412 --> 01:18:55,528
So what's going on with your son?

1069
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:01,325
- How do you mean?
- You know exactly what l mean.

1070
01:19:05,812 --> 01:19:09,327
Sometimes he sits through
an entire meal without saying a word.

1071
01:19:12,612 --> 01:19:15,524
He just shovels food into
his mouth like a machine.

1072
01:19:15,772 --> 01:19:17,728
l get so nervous. . .

1073
01:19:18,612 --> 01:19:20,330
. . .l can't swallow.

1074
01:19:20,812 --> 01:19:24,122
l'll sit there with
the same piece of food in my mouth.

1075
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:28,290
l have to spit it out.
When l do, he looks at me. . .

1076
01:19:28,492 --> 01:19:30,926
. . .like he'd like to kill me.

1077
01:19:33,012 --> 01:19:34,604
Don't tell him l said that.

1078
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:37,127
l promise l won't.

1079
01:19:37,932 --> 01:19:41,720
l try not to be a burden.
l'm not just talking financial.

1080
01:19:42,012 --> 01:19:44,526
How could you be a burden to anyone?

1081
01:19:46,092 --> 01:19:48,447
lf William, or Bill,
as l like to call him--

1082
01:19:48,692 --> 01:19:51,490
He likes Bill.
l call him Bill too.

1083
01:19:51,732 --> 01:19:53,404
lf Bill said he was going home. . .

1084
01:19:53,612 --> 01:19:56,524
. . .could he have meant
where his wife and child live?

1085
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:59,161
Ex-wife.
We shouldn't be in here.

1086
01:20:00,892 --> 01:20:04,567
Ex-wife, right. Elizabeth.
What's her maiden name?

1087
01:20:04,772 --> 01:20:07,605
Trevino. She was part ltalian.
You know how they are.

1088
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:10,241
- Where's Elizabeth now?
- l wouldn't know.

1089
01:20:11,732 --> 01:20:13,882
You don't know where
your grandchild lives?

1090
01:20:15,212 --> 01:20:19,524
He doesn't want me to know.
He blames me for what happened.

1091
01:20:22,332 --> 01:20:23,128
What's the word?

1092
01:20:25,372 --> 01:20:27,806
- He was fired over a month ago.
- What?

1093
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,932
Where has he been going every day?

1094
01:20:38,492 --> 01:20:40,722
Where has he been eating his lunch?

1095
01:20:53,612 --> 01:20:56,080
Why are you putting
barbed wire on that fence?

1096
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:57,281
ls it a joke?

1097
01:20:57,532 --> 01:21:00,968
ls this how rich people have fun?
You put barbed wire on the fence. . .

1098
01:21:01,212 --> 01:21:04,124
. . .so innocent people like me
can cut our hands?

1099
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:08,121
No, please. l'm the caretaker.

1100
01:21:08,372 --> 01:21:09,851
lt's just a barbecue.

1101
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:13,326
Dr. Ashcroft has let us do this before.

1102
01:21:15,012 --> 01:21:16,525
You don't live here?

1103
01:21:16,932 --> 01:21:18,888
ls it really necessary to tell them?

1104
01:21:20,212 --> 01:21:21,361
Tell who?

1105
01:21:22,532 --> 01:21:23,487
Altmore Security.

1106
01:21:24,812 --> 01:21:26,723
Aren't you with them?

1107
01:21:35,572 --> 01:21:37,324
No, please!

1108
01:21:38,492 --> 01:21:40,483
lt's okay, honey.
lt's okay, baby.

1109
01:21:53,412 --> 01:21:55,243
What kind of doctor lives here?

1110
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:58,045
Plastic surgeon.

1111
01:22:01,972 --> 01:22:03,849
Plastic surgery bought all this?

1112
01:22:05,812 --> 01:22:07,928
Guess l'm in the wrong racket.

1113
01:22:10,132 --> 01:22:13,124
Are there correspondence courses
in plastic surgery?

1114
01:22:17,812 --> 01:22:19,723
l lost my job.

1115
01:22:19,932 --> 01:22:23,083
Actually, l didn't lose it.
lt lost me.

1116
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:27,441
l'm overeducated, underskilled. . . .

1117
01:22:29,892 --> 01:22:32,247
Maybe it's the other way around.
l forget.

1118
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:34,329
And l'm obsolete.

1119
01:22:36,172 --> 01:22:39,323
l'm not economically viable.

1120
01:22:43,372 --> 01:22:45,727
l can't even support my own kid.

1121
01:22:48,612 --> 01:22:50,409
Are you hurt? l'm sorry.

1122
01:22:50,652 --> 01:22:52,768
l didn't hurt you, honey.
l'm sorry.

1123
01:22:53,212 --> 01:22:54,088
lt's all right.

1124
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,081
lt's your hand.

1125
01:22:57,092 --> 01:22:59,128
You cut your hand.

1126
01:23:02,212 --> 01:23:03,930
lt's my hand.

1127
01:23:08,812 --> 01:23:10,723
Please take me with you.

1128
01:23:12,012 --> 01:23:14,765
They won't do anything
if l'm with you.

1129
01:23:15,932 --> 01:23:17,729
Just please let them go.

1130
01:23:21,412 --> 01:23:24,802
What do you think?
You think l want to hurt your family?

1131
01:23:28,412 --> 01:23:30,528
l have a family of my own.

1132
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:33,368
You don't believe me?

1133
01:23:34,732 --> 01:23:36,131
We believe you.

1134
01:23:39,972 --> 01:23:43,328
That's where l'm going.
l'm going home to see my family.

1135
01:23:46,972 --> 01:23:49,327
lt's my little girl's birthday today.

1136
01:23:51,132 --> 01:23:54,920
We were gonna have a barbecue,
like you guys. . .

1137
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:58,726
. . .and she was gonna play outside. . .

1138
01:23:59,772 --> 01:24:02,525
. . .and my wife would hold my hand. . .

1139
01:24:03,812 --> 01:24:06,326
. . .and talk about grownup things.

1140
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,328
And then when it got dark. . .

1141
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:15,921
. . .we'd all go to sleep together.

1142
01:24:18,492 --> 01:24:20,926
We'd all sleep together in the dark.

1143
01:24:23,612 --> 01:24:25,330
And everything. . .

1144
01:24:25,892 --> 01:24:28,725
. . .would be just like it was before.

1145
01:24:37,852 --> 01:24:41,208
You can't leave. Believe me,
something's happened to him.

1146
01:24:41,412 --> 01:24:44,370
lt doesn't take all day
to drive from Pasadena to Venice.

1147
01:24:44,572 --> 01:24:47,609
That doesn't constitute
a threatening phone call.

1148
01:24:47,812 --> 01:24:50,167
The guy was talking about
Star Trek or something.

1149
01:24:50,412 --> 01:24:53,768
- He's getting a kick out of scaring you.
- Please don't leave.

1150
01:24:54,012 --> 01:24:57,527
There's only one thing you can do
to really feel safer.

1151
01:24:57,732 --> 01:24:59,609
Next time there's a proposition. . .

1152
01:24:59,812 --> 01:25:04,010
. . .to cut the number of patrol cars
on the street, vote no, okay?

1153
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:06,407
Have a nice day.

1154
01:25:22,772 --> 01:25:24,330
What have you found so far?

1155
01:25:24,532 --> 01:25:25,965
No luck on Foster-Trevino.

1156
01:25:26,212 --> 01:25:28,521
Go straight to the maiden name.

1157
01:25:29,012 --> 01:25:31,606
l've got something
on an Army-Navy store.

1158
01:25:31,892 --> 01:25:34,326
- Where?
- Here.

1159
01:25:35,572 --> 01:25:38,086
Jesus, Prendergast, l was there!

1160
01:25:38,292 --> 01:25:39,771
That guy was a prick.

1161
01:25:40,012 --> 01:25:41,570
You know what else he was?

1162
01:25:41,972 --> 01:25:45,487
Murdered. They found him stuffed
in his own display case.

1163
01:25:45,772 --> 01:25:47,171
Oh, my God!

1164
01:25:47,412 --> 01:25:49,721
Here, l'll help you change the--

1165
01:25:57,212 --> 01:25:58,725
You know what they did?

1166
01:25:58,972 --> 01:26:03,602
They turned our ice-cream parlor into
a Southwest American, New Age thing.

1167
01:26:03,852 --> 01:26:05,649
I went to buy a rocking horse.

1168
01:26:05,892 --> 01:26:09,362
All l could find was a unicorn
with an lndian on top of it.

1169
01:26:09,572 --> 01:26:12,484
Can you believe that, Elizabeth?
Can you believe it?

1170
01:26:15,372 --> 01:26:16,441
Come on!

1171
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:19,442
Where are we going?
When's my birthday?

1172
01:27:02,692 --> 01:27:05,809
Some G.l. Joe gave a geezer
a heart attack at the golf course. . .

1173
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:08,606
. . .and accosted a family
right next door.

1174
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:09,722
A G.l. Joe?

1175
01:27:09,932 --> 01:27:14,130
He's wearing the kind of jacket
you find in an Army-Navy store.

1176
01:27:15,212 --> 01:27:17,646
l found her!
Trevino, Elizabeth.

1177
01:27:17,852 --> 01:27:18,648
Don't tell me.

1178
01:27:19,492 --> 01:27:20,402
Venice.

1179
01:27:22,012 --> 01:27:22,967
How'd you know?

1180
01:27:23,172 --> 01:27:25,481
Where else would an ltalian move to?

1181
01:27:25,732 --> 01:27:28,530
Look what I got.

1182
01:27:29,852 --> 01:27:34,767
We got a puppy.
We got a puppy.

1183
01:27:36,612 --> 01:27:39,729
Happy birthday to you

1184
01:27:40,612 --> 01:27:43,809
Happy birthday to you

1185
01:27:58,812 --> 01:27:59,642
Hi, puppy!

1186
01:28:11,812 --> 01:28:13,723
No answer at the ex-wife.

1187
01:28:13,972 --> 01:28:16,725
- You send the cavalry?
- No, Pacific Division are pricks.

1188
01:28:16,932 --> 01:28:20,527
They can't send units to the same
address three times in a day. . .

1189
01:28:20,732 --> 01:28:22,404
. . .to comfort some hysterical woman.

1190
01:28:22,612 --> 01:28:24,921
- What do you want to do?
- Go to Venice.

1191
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:27,328
Get that, would you?

1192
01:28:27,532 --> 01:28:28,328
Prendergast here.

1193
01:28:28,572 --> 01:28:29,607
Who the fuck is this?

1194
01:28:30,212 --> 01:28:32,009
Shit. lt's your wife.

1195
01:28:32,252 --> 01:28:33,571
Oh, boy. Hon?

1196
01:28:33,812 --> 01:28:36,406
Yeah, "hon. " l know who that was!

1197
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:38,967
Mr. Peepers just scratched
the shit out of me. . .

1198
01:28:39,212 --> 01:28:41,203
. . .and l'm bleeding like a stuck pig.

1199
01:28:41,812 --> 01:28:43,530
Something important's come up.

1200
01:28:44,012 --> 01:28:45,809
What am l? Dog vomit?

1201
01:28:46,012 --> 01:28:47,968
Your wife says
she's bleeding to death. . .

1202
01:28:48,172 --> 01:28:50,402
. . .and you say something
important has come up?

1203
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:53,801
- When are you coming home?
- l don't know.

1204
01:28:54,812 --> 01:28:57,372
Don't tell me you don't know.

1205
01:28:57,572 --> 01:29:00,803
l want to know when the hell
you're coming home, now!

1206
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:03,247
Amanda, shut up!

1207
01:29:03,612 --> 01:29:05,170
Did you hear me?
Shut up!

1208
01:29:06,812 --> 01:29:10,282
l'll get home when l'm finished,
not a second before. ls that clear?

1209
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,404
ls that clear?

1210
01:29:14,572 --> 01:29:17,132
You don't have to bite my head off.

1211
01:29:18,212 --> 01:29:22,330
And you have dinner ready
and waiting for me, okay?

1212
01:29:23,212 --> 01:29:26,807
And leave the skin on the chicken.
All right?

1213
01:29:29,892 --> 01:29:30,881
Goodbye.

1214
01:29:35,732 --> 01:29:36,926
Shit!

1215
01:29:37,652 --> 01:29:38,641
Let's go!

1216
01:29:39,092 --> 01:29:41,083
Surprise!

1217
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:45,923
l'm sorry, Prendergast!

1218
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:51,087
We tried and tried, but could not
fit your fucking name on the cake!

1219
01:29:53,732 --> 01:29:55,563
Congratulations.
You made it out alive!

1220
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:56,728
Listen, listen.

1221
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:59,446
All right, hold it, hold it.

1222
01:29:59,772 --> 01:30:02,923
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been waiting for.

1223
01:30:03,172 --> 01:30:07,324
This afternoon's entertainment,
Miss Suzie!

1224
01:30:14,812 --> 01:30:15,881
Suzie Q!

1225
01:30:16,132 --> 01:30:18,327
Do your thing!

1226
01:30:18,932 --> 01:30:21,366
ls this the retiring boy?

1227
01:30:21,652 --> 01:30:23,529
Wait, wait!
This is great, guys.

1228
01:30:23,732 --> 01:30:28,328
This is great.
l appreciate it, but l can't stay.

1229
01:30:28,812 --> 01:30:32,009
Jesus! What's your problem?
You afraid of women too?

1230
01:30:32,212 --> 01:30:34,726
l don't blame him.
You ever met his wife?

1231
01:30:36,212 --> 01:30:37,008
What did you say?

1232
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:38,731
- What?
- What did you say?

1233
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:39,728
Nothing.

1234
01:30:39,972 --> 01:30:42,327
We don't have time for this.

1235
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:45,325
You're right.

1236
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,040
Ready, honey?

1237
01:30:56,612 --> 01:31:00,366
Happy birthday to you

1238
01:31:01,212 --> 01:31:02,930
Happy birthday...

1239
01:31:03,212 --> 01:31:05,123
... to you

1240
01:31:06,452 --> 01:31:07,487
No cake for you?

1241
01:31:07,732 --> 01:31:09,927
If she doesn 't want it,
don 't force her.

1242
01:31:10,172 --> 01:31:11,924
Okay, you can have the teddy.

1243
01:31:12,172 --> 01:31:13,844
Time to go horsy!

1244
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:17,526
It's okay. Horsy!
It's okay.

1245
01:31:18,212 --> 01:31:20,726
Giddyap, giddyap.

1246
01:31:25,492 --> 01:31:28,723
- She doesn 't want to.
- Just put her on the horse!

1247
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:31,607
There we go! Horsy ride.

1248
01:31:32,852 --> 01:31:33,887
She doesn 't want to.

1249
01:31:34,132 --> 01:31:37,488
- Put her on the horse!
- You can 't force her like that.

1250
01:31:37,732 --> 01:31:39,962
I bought her the goddamn horse.

1251
01:31:40,212 --> 01:31:42,328
Here we go! Horsy ride.

1252
01:31:42,572 --> 01:31:45,530
You're scaring her.
I want you to stop this.

1253
01:31:49,572 --> 01:31:52,245
Come on, honey.
It's your birthday. It's the pier.

1254
01:31:52,492 --> 01:31:55,723
It's your favorite place.
You love the pier.

1255
01:31:58,772 --> 01:32:00,125
Why do you do this?

1256
01:32:26,252 --> 01:32:27,651
Take the back.

1257
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,040
Freeze!

1258
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:00,288
You okay?

1259
01:33:00,532 --> 01:33:02,921
- l'm all right.
- Somebody get an ambulance.

1260
01:33:03,332 --> 01:33:06,642
Get an ambulance! Call 91 1 !
Get an ambulance!

1261
01:33:06,932 --> 01:33:11,244
Tell them an officer's been shot!
Go, go, go! Get an ambulance!

1262
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:14,528
Be careful!

1263
01:33:16,612 --> 01:33:18,011
Go get the bastard!

1264
01:33:18,332 --> 01:33:20,050
He's still dressed like G.l. Joe!

1265
01:34:12,252 --> 01:34:14,402
Daddy! Mommy, look.
Daddy!

1266
01:34:31,692 --> 01:34:32,488
Hi, honey.

1267
01:34:32,972 --> 01:34:35,042
l thought l'd find you here.

1268
01:34:37,492 --> 01:34:38,641
Leave us alone!

1269
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:42,128
What? l can't talk to my wife?

1270
01:34:42,852 --> 01:34:44,171
l'm not your wife anymore.

1271
01:34:44,492 --> 01:34:48,451
No? Sugar, does this ring a bell?
"Till death do us part"?

1272
01:34:48,932 --> 01:34:50,604
Do you remember that?

1273
01:34:57,292 --> 01:34:58,088
l'm sorry.

1274
01:34:58,492 --> 01:34:59,925
Sorry, sorry.

1275
01:35:00,172 --> 01:35:01,082
What are you doing?

1276
01:35:01,332 --> 01:35:03,892
l'm coming home from
a hard day at the office.

1277
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:06,441
God bless the working stiffs!

1278
01:35:13,252 --> 01:35:15,402
Please leave her alone!

1279
01:35:25,812 --> 01:35:27,450
You're so big!

1280
01:35:29,212 --> 01:35:30,611
How'd you get so big?

1281
01:35:33,732 --> 01:35:35,085
l missed it.

1282
01:35:36,052 --> 01:35:38,043
They stole it from me, honey.

1283
01:35:39,012 --> 01:35:41,651
Don't you worry. They're not
gonna take it anymore.

1284
01:35:46,732 --> 01:35:48,484
Bill, listen, please.

1285
01:35:50,812 --> 01:35:53,042
You've got to stop this.

1286
01:35:56,732 --> 01:35:58,245
You need help.

1287
01:35:59,812 --> 01:36:00,881
You're sick.

1288
01:36:01,692 --> 01:36:02,681
Sick?

1289
01:36:03,732 --> 01:36:05,324
You wanna see sick?

1290
01:36:05,532 --> 01:36:07,727
Take a walk around this town.
That's sick.

1291
01:36:07,932 --> 01:36:09,081
You ain't kidding.

1292
01:36:12,852 --> 01:36:15,650
Would you believe it
that l used to fish right here?

1293
01:36:18,212 --> 01:36:20,043
This very spot?

1294
01:36:20,532 --> 01:36:23,251
Now they tell you,
"Don't eat the fish. lt's poisonous. "

1295
01:36:24,732 --> 01:36:26,927
You can't even swim in the water.

1296
01:36:27,252 --> 01:36:30,050
lt'll give you some kind of
bacterial infection.

1297
01:36:31,532 --> 01:36:33,250
How's that for sick?

1298
01:36:33,812 --> 01:36:36,610
l'm having a private moment
with my family. Leave us alone.

1299
01:36:37,052 --> 01:36:38,849
l'm leaving soon.

1300
01:36:39,932 --> 01:36:42,526
l'm retiring to Arizona.
Lake Havasu City.

1301
01:36:43,212 --> 01:36:44,201
You been there?

1302
01:36:44,452 --> 01:36:46,044
That's not what l mean!

1303
01:36:47,932 --> 01:36:51,811
They call it a lake, but it's really
just a big bowl of muddy water.

1304
01:36:52,012 --> 01:36:54,446
But the wife thinks it's paradise.

1305
01:36:55,212 --> 01:36:58,045
Everybody has their own idea
of what paradise is.

1306
01:37:01,332 --> 01:37:02,401
Take me, for instance.

1307
01:37:05,012 --> 01:37:07,048
You know what l thought paradise was?

1308
01:37:07,252 --> 01:37:09,641
- What?
- lf you'll excuse me.

1309
01:37:11,132 --> 01:37:12,281
Making babies.

1310
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:16,250
Ain't that a kick?
Making babies.

1311
01:37:17,612 --> 01:37:19,250
This your little girl?

1312
01:37:20,052 --> 01:37:21,451
Beautiful.

1313
01:37:23,332 --> 01:37:24,481
She's special.

1314
01:37:29,092 --> 01:37:32,050
You know, my wife never was
cut out for motherhood.

1315
01:37:32,692 --> 01:37:33,727
She did it all for me.

1316
01:37:33,972 --> 01:37:36,645
Went through all that pain,
lost her figure, for me.

1317
01:37:37,692 --> 01:37:40,445
Then the kid went to sleep
one night, never woke up.

1318
01:37:41,612 --> 01:37:43,842
They called it "lnfant Death. . .

1319
01:37:45,132 --> 01:37:46,645
. . .Syndrome. "

1320
01:37:47,732 --> 01:37:50,292
But she wasn't an infant.
She was 2 years old.

1321
01:37:50,492 --> 01:37:52,210
She was a big girl.

1322
01:37:53,852 --> 01:37:55,444
She was our baby.

1323
01:37:58,412 --> 01:38:01,165
Here, darling, this is for you.
Here you go.

1324
01:38:07,492 --> 01:38:09,244
What can you do?

1325
01:38:10,492 --> 01:38:13,245
lf she'd been hit by a drunk driver. . . .

1326
01:38:13,532 --> 01:38:16,046
But who do you blame
when they just don't wake up?

1327
01:38:16,732 --> 01:38:17,642
Thank you, sweetheart.

1328
01:38:21,932 --> 01:38:23,126
There's a guy with a gun!

1329
01:38:27,172 --> 01:38:28,844
No! Don't!

1330
01:38:30,612 --> 01:38:31,601
Elizabeth, no!

1331
01:38:32,332 --> 01:38:34,846
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

1332
01:38:35,052 --> 01:38:36,041
Get out of here!

1333
01:38:37,012 --> 01:38:38,445
Freeze!

1334
01:38:41,612 --> 01:38:43,887
- What were you gonna do?
- l don't know!

1335
01:38:44,092 --> 01:38:46,162
Guys like you always say that!

1336
01:38:46,412 --> 01:38:50,610
You know exactly what you were
gonna do. Kill your wife and child!

1337
01:38:52,012 --> 01:38:56,369
Then it'd be too late to turn back.
lt'd be easy to kill yourself.

1338
01:38:56,852 --> 01:39:00,288
Let's go meet some nice policemen.
They're good guys. Let's go.

1339
01:39:01,652 --> 01:39:02,641
l'm the bad guy?

1340
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:10,648
How did that happen?

1341
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:14,446
l did everything they told me to.

1342
01:39:17,532 --> 01:39:18,965
Did you know l build missiles?

1343
01:39:19,852 --> 01:39:21,649
l help to protect America.

1344
01:39:25,012 --> 01:39:26,809
You should be rewarded for that.

1345
01:39:27,012 --> 01:39:30,482
lnstead, they give it to
the plastic surgeon. They lied to me.

1346
01:39:32,732 --> 01:39:36,441
ls that what this is about?
You're angry because you got lied to?

1347
01:39:36,932 --> 01:39:39,127
ls that why my dinner's
drying out in the oven?

1348
01:39:39,892 --> 01:39:42,884
They lie to everybody.
They lie to the fish!

1349
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:47,090
That doesn't give you any right
to do what you did today.

1350
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:52,408
The only thing that makes you special
is that little girl. Now, let's go.

1351
01:39:53,492 --> 01:39:54,845
Let's go!

1352
01:40:01,892 --> 01:40:03,450
Sure was hot today, wasn't it?

1353
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,044
He has a gun!
The end of the pier!

1354
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,085
Keep this crowd back!
Let's get some backup!

1355
01:40:15,732 --> 01:40:17,085
You know, l got a gun.

1356
01:40:23,212 --> 01:40:24,406
ln my pocket.

1357
01:40:28,892 --> 01:40:29,961
l got lots of guns.

1358
01:40:30,212 --> 01:40:32,442
Stay there. Don't move.

1359
01:40:33,092 --> 01:40:33,888
You wanna draw?

1360
01:40:34,532 --> 01:40:37,126
Let's not.
Let's call it a day.

1361
01:40:37,372 --> 01:40:39,044
Now come on.

1362
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:41,049
lt's perfect.

1363
01:40:41,572 --> 01:40:44,928
Showdown between the sheriff
and the bad guy?

1364
01:40:46,932 --> 01:40:48,081
lt's beautiful.

1365
01:40:52,932 --> 01:40:54,001
On three.

1366
01:40:54,252 --> 01:40:57,528
This doesn't have to be the end.
You have a choice.

1367
01:40:57,732 --> 01:41:00,929
My little girl is dead.
l don't have a choice. You do!

1368
01:41:01,532 --> 01:41:03,682
No, you have two choices:

1369
01:41:04,132 --> 01:41:05,247
l can kill you.

1370
01:41:06,332 --> 01:41:08,243
Or you can kill me. . .

1371
01:41:08,652 --> 01:41:11,246
. . .and my little girl
can get the insurance.

1372
01:41:13,852 --> 01:41:14,648
One. . . .

1373
01:41:14,892 --> 01:41:16,848
Don't you wanna see her grow up?

1374
01:41:17,452 --> 01:41:19,249
Behind bars?

1375
01:41:23,412 --> 01:41:24,891
Don't do this.
Please.

1376
01:41:26,532 --> 01:41:27,760
- Let's go!
- Three.

1377
01:41:36,532 --> 01:41:38,648
l would have got you.

1378
01:42:16,452 --> 01:42:20,445
What cooperation was there between
Pacific Division and Downtown?

1379
01:42:20,652 --> 01:42:22,688
Not to denigrate the Venice Police. . .

1380
01:42:22,932 --> 01:42:26,322
. . .but it was one of our fellows
that put this together.

1381
01:42:26,532 --> 01:42:27,885
