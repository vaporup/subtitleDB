– You're leaving?
– But didn't you have fun today?

692
00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:53,965
Well, of course I did,
more than I've had in years,

693

(BOTH GRUNTING)

1530
01:36:43,692 --> 01:36:46,121
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

1531
01:36:46,161 --> 01:36:49,790
– WOODY: Oh, look at this!
– Golly Bob howdy! That's me!

1532
01:36:49,898 --> 01:36:53,197
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, Iookin' good.

1533
01:36:53,302 --> 01:36:55,876
DOLLY: Yeah, she really got your smile.

1534
01:36:57,806 --> 01:36:59,201
ALL: Whee! Whee! Whee!

1535
01:36:59,241 --> 01:37:00,799
Oh! Oh! (LAUGHS)

1536
01:37:02,978 --> 01:37:04,343
What the…

1537
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,172
(LAUGHING)

1538
01:37:06,281 --> 01:37:09,845
MR. POTATO HEAD: I told you kids!
Stay out of my butt!

1539
01:37:10,152 --> 01:37:13,588
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

1540
01:37:13,956 --> 01:37:17,255
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

1541
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:19,885
Next season, we're doing Cats.

1542
01:37:19,995 --> 01:37:22,623
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1543
01:37:23,699 --> 01:37:26,566
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

1544
01:37:26,935 --> 01:37:28,897
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1545
01:37:28,937 --> 01:37:30,996
(FLAMENCO MUSIC PLAYING)

1546
01:37:31,506 --> 01:37:32,564
Huh?

1547
01:37:34,743 --> 01:37:36,404
(EXCLAIMING)

1548
01:37:38,947 --> 01:37:39,936
(CHUCKLING)

1549
01:37:40,048 --> 01:37:42,141
I don't know what came over me.

1550
01:37:43,452 --> 01:37:45,147
Just go with it, Buzz.
