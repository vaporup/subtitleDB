1
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,610
Boxers!

2
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,060
Not one step further.

3
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,500
The keeper
of the Imperial Seal.

4
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,090
Just the man I was looking for.

5
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,330
A woman.

6
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,740
You Chinese are very progressive.

7
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,350
A gift from an old friend.

8
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,140
Wu Chow.

9
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,680
He wanted me to send his regards.

10
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,520
Father!

11
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,610
Father.

12
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,090
The seal.
You must get it back.

13
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,480
I promise.

14
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Give this... to your brother.

15
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,050
What are you reading?

16
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,760
Oh.
"Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy."

17
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,060
It's incredible.

18
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,230
Roy's just taken out
the Mummy's entire army

19
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,830
of zombie confederate soldiers,
and he only had one bullet.

20
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,570
That's impossible.

21
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,900
Oh, no, it's not.

22
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,640
Oh, I see! Roy figured out
the physics of the canyon

23
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,180
and then ricocheted a bullet
off the canyon wall.

24
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,240
Nailed each zombie through the heart.

25
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,610
What about the Shanghai Kid?

26
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,420
He was captured
and knocked out on page 10

27
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,150
while he was polishing
Roy's pearl handles.

28
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,320
Don't you worry.

29
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,450
Roy's about to save him from
becoming a human sacrifice.

30
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,330
Those stories are all lies.

31
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,450
No. See?

32
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,790
It says right here on the back.

33
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,030
"Author Sage McCallister bases
all his stories

34
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,930
on firsthand accounts."

35
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,360
Sorry, sheriff.
No princess.

36
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,630
Every day you meet
the noon stage.

37
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,140
Every day it's the same story.

38
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
She's not coming back.

39
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,240
Pei Pei's married to her work
in San Francisco.

40
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,740
Modern woman.

41
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,070
Sheriff, you got a parcel.

42
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,310
Hey, maybe it's from her!

43
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,850
No. It's from my sister in China.

44
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,640
I know.

45
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,340
I know.
I must go.

46
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,810
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

47
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,420
Uh, sheriff,
that stage is headed east.

48
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,150
Isn't China kind of west of here?

49
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,920
I'm not going to China.
I'm going to New York.

50
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,430
Roy invested my money.

51
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,130
Is it true that he lives in a
penthouse at the top of the Ritz

52
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,890
surrounded by dozens
of beautiful women

53
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,560
at his every beck and call?

54
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,100
That's the old Roy.

55
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,440
He's married, settled down.

56
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,310
Trust me, he's changed.

57
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,470
So there we were.
Completely outnumbered.

58
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,310
He didn't have to tell me
we didn't stand a chance.

59
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,650
So I send the Shanghai Kid
and the princess out the back.

60
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,280
Poor Shanghai Kid.
He was so frightened.

61
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,650
He forgot to thank me
for saving his life.

62
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,480
I'm used to that.

63
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,460
Now, I returned to the front,
and I counted to three...

64
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,660
and I burst out of the mission.

65
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,640
Pearl handles blazing.
Lead flying everywhere.

66
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
And not a single bullet touched me.

67
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,100
- No!
- Yeah.

68
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,340
What happened
to the emperor's gold?

69
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,670
Well, we divided it up.

70
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,840
I insisted on giving my share
to the Indians.

71
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,080
The savages?

72
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,850
Please don't ever call
those noble people savages.

73
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,150
If being proud of your body

74
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,660
and wanting to ride around naked
all day makes you a savage,

75
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,690
then, by God,
you're drinking with a savage.

76
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,440
And that is what you call
a French toast.

77
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,140
You are so sophisticated,
Mr. O'Bannon.

78
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,180
Whoo!

79
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,450
Who's up for some more bubbly?

80
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,460
Reach for the sky, Roy.

81
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,700
Say that again.

82
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,930
Reach for the sky, Roy.

83
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,570
Chon Wang!

84
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,440
You sly son of a gun!

85
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,480
- Look at you!
- Look at you!

86
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,670
- What brings you to New York?
- My share of the gold.

87
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,010
Refresh my memory.
What gold are we talking about?

88
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,210
The emperor's gold.

89
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,810
Okay, now, that gold is in

90
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,690
what the Wall Street pros call
a long-term investment.

91
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,690
We can't touch it right now
because it's building.

92
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,750
I need it tonight.

93
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,760
You just got here.
Let's celebrate a little bit.

94
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,760
No. I don't have time.

95
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,200
- You just got to the big city.
- My father's been killed.

96
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,770
Chon, I'm...

97
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,770
You need the money to get back
for the funeral?

98
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,110
No. I must go to England.
The ship leaves tonight.

99
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,670
Wait. Your father died in England?

100
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,480
China. My sister followed
the murderer to London.

101
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,110
Wait. Murderer.
I'm a little bit mixed up.

102
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,180
Let me see if I can get
the facts straight.

103
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,350
You have a sister? You never
told me you had a sister.

104
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,790
Is she pretty or does she look
like you? Be honest.

105
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,190
Roy, I need my money!

106
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,200
I don't like
that tone of voice.

107
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,330
You think after all we've been
through I'd stiff you?

108
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm doing pretty well
for myself.

109
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,160
Yeah.

110
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,210
- I'm sorry, Roy.
- That's okay.

111
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,300
You're going through
a really tough time right now.

112
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,570
You got to be more trusting
of people, okay?

113
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,380
Look at me.
It's Roy.

114
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,580
The couple at table 5
is ready to order.

115
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,980
Do you work here?

116
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,320
No, I don't work here.

117
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,830
It looks like these guys
are wearing a similar jacket.

118
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,360
Roy, here's your cut of the tips.

119
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,730
It's the craziest thing.

120
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,460
I guess because
I come in here so much

121
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,970
they're mistaking me
for a waiter.

122
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,670
- It's embarrassing.
- You lost the gold.

123
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,100
- Not all of it.
- Where's the rest?

124
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,050
I have one word for you.
Zeppelin.

125
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,850
I need my money now!

126
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,720
Easy, easy.

127
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,010
Will you do anything for this money?

128
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,960
Yes.
I must leave tonight.

129
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,820
Okay.
Take this key.

130
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,790
Go to the room.
Get cleaned up.

131
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,420
Your old pal Roy's got a plan.

132
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,660
Go! Come on!

133
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,380
Howdy, big boy.

134
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,760
What?

135
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,530
There's a woman in there!
She wants me to sleep with her.

136
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,660
Of course she does.

137
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,930
I told her the Great Wall
ain't the only big thing

138
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,970
coming out of China.

139
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,600
- Why did you say that?
- So you could get the money.

140
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,770
I will not sleep with women
for money!

141
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,770
Why?

142
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm gonna sleep with her
for money.

143
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,340
Chon, just go in there
and do your business

144
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,510
and think about your sister
in England.

145
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,020
- What?
- Roy!

146
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,920
- Duty calls.
- Roy!

147
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,460
Good evening, Mr. Mayor.

148
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,860
Where are they?

149
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,090
Who?

150
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,870
My daughters.

151
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,060
10th floor.

152
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,580
Roy?
Roy, you got trouble.

153
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,240
Roy!

154
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,840
I got to check on something.
I'll be right back.

155
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,880
Chon, new plan.
We got to go.

156
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,720
Chon, what are you doing?!

157
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,050
I'm fixing her back.

158
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,590
Put her down,
you decadent Philistine.

159
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,050
Hey, Chon, come on!
Let's go!

160
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,320
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

161
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,260
Come on!

162
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,070
I don't understand.
What's going on?

163
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,400
I don't have time to explain.

164
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,960
All you have to know is there
are bad men after us...

165
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,440
but I'm in the right.

166
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,950
- Roy.
- Chon, c'mon. You gotta trust me on this.

167
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,110
Okay, look.

168
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,080
I'm in a transitional phase
in my life right now.

169
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,640
- But...
- But what?

170
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,120
You want to know the truth?

171
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,180
I'm a little lost right now.

172
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,280
I see you.
You've got a sense of purpose.

173
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,130
But look at me.
I'm a 30-year-old waiter/gigolo.

174
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,530
Where's the future in that?

175
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,060
So what's the plan?

176
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,010
You were always my compass, Chon.

177
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,340
The plan.
You ask me the right questions.

178
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,380
The plan?

179
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,180
The plan, I think,
is to find the right woman.

180
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,680
Raise a lot of children
and teach them values.

181
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,520
No, Roy.
The plan to get out of here.

182
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,350
Okay, the plan.
Here we go.

183
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,390
- Cops! Cops!
- They can help us.

184
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,770
No, no.
Chon, not these cops.

185
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,810
These are dirty cops.
They take advantage of people.

186
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,330
Now, if they stop us, remember,
I'm not Roy O'Bannon.

187
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,850
Who are you?

188
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,210
I'm your friend Smoky Desperado
from the West.

189
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,550
And who am I?

190
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,680
You. You're Benihana.

191
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,880
- Benihana.
- Yeah.

192
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,480
You teach crippled children yoga
here in the city.

193
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,550
- You go first.
- No! Why me?

194
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,060
Because you blend in, okay?

195
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,070
Now, go!
Don't let them see you!

196
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,900
Benihana.

197
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,080
Hey! Hey!

198
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,720
Ooh.

199
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,580
Psst! Chon!

200
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,180
Come on.
Stop wasting time.

201
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,790
You!

202
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,090
Chon, I found our ticket
out of here.

203
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,000
We're on our way.

204
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,190
Looks like old Roy
came through again.

205
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,260
Just like old times, Chon.

206
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,070
Check over there!

207
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,200
- Over to the alley!
- That way!

208
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,310
Yeah, just like old times.

209
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,110
Will you forget about the gold
for a second?

210
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,910
You're gonna have more money
than you ever dreamed of

211
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,750
when that first zeppelin takes off.

212
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,910
Why do I always believe you?

213
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,790
What do you mean?

214
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,380
You're lucky I didn't invest

215
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,450
in that ridiculous automobile idea.

216
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,360
Yeah, that's gonna make
a lot of money.

217
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
What's that?

218
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,390
Doghouse.
I'm in the doghouse.

219
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,060
Oh, come on, Chon.

220
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,100
Look, I'm sorry I lied.

221
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,660
I just didn't want to disappoint you.

222
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,060
That's exactly what I mean.

223
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,730
I can't take that look.

224
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,470
I learned it from my father.

225
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,700
That's how he used to look at me.

226
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,540
What did your dad do?
Was he an Imperial Guard?

227
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,640
No.

228
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,580
Much more important.

229
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,150
He was the keeper
of the Imperial Seal.

230
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,680
That's what I love about China.

231
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,560
Everybody's job description
sounds so damn cool.

232
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,650
The seal has been symbol
of the emperor's power

233
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,920
since Genghis Khan.

234
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,300
It has been passed down
from one emperor to another.

235
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,900
My family have been watching
over it for 12 generations.

236
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,530
12 generations?

237
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,670
My father and I used to
skip stones across the moat

238
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,980
and talk about a day
I would follow his footsteps.

239
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,450
I was his only son.

240
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,110
If I'd have been there,
I could have protected him.

241
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,590
It's not your fault.
You were 3,000 miles away.

242
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,620
What's with that little box?

243
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,470
My sister sent it to me
from my father.

244
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,270
- There's a message inside.
- What's it say?

245
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,070
It's a puzzle box.
I don't know how to open yet.

246
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,070
What do you mean?

247
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,700
Get a hammer and smash it open
so you can see what it says.

248
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,010
I must have patience.

249
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,410
By the time
I'm able to open it...

250
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,880
I will be ready to read
the message.

251
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,140
Come on, Confucius.

252
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,450
That's the corniest thing
I've ever heard.

253
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,360
Let me see this.

254
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,920
You know what?

255
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,930
We're gonna go to England.

256
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,470
We're gonna find your dad's killer.

257
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,020
We're gonna get that seal back.

258
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,590
There's no reward for this, Roy.

259
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,900
Who said anything
about a reward?

260
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,460
I'm talking about friendship,
loyalty, honor.

261
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,030
Okay?

262
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,480
Thank you, Roy.

263
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,310
And I hear England is ass soup.

264
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,610
A lot of pretty girls there.

265
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,460
First order of business,
my Lords...

266
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,330
is a report from our esteemed
friend Lord Rathbone...

267
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,370
who recently returned from
a diplomatic mission to China.

268
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,250
Fellow Lords...

269
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm afraid I bring disturbing
news from the Orient.

270
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,020
The opium wars have ravaged the land.

271
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,500
The emperor's enemies
are organizing.

272
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,160
The most vicious are the Boxers.

273
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,230
A godless band of rebels
who murder without discretion.

274
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,010
China is not well.

275
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,740
I have brought back an envoy
who should give us some insight

276
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,380
into the inscrutable mind
of the Chinese.

277
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,290
Is he mad?

278
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,290
Given to Her Majesty
Queen Victoria by the emperor

279
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,200
in recognition of her
50 glorious years on the throne.

280
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,660
Outrageousness!

281
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,770
Long live the queen.

282
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,430
Jack the Ripper strikes again!

283
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,230
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.

284
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,960
Howdy, partner.

285
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,030
The English are not very friendly.

286
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,600
They're just sore losers.

287
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,140
What did they lose?

288
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,650
A little thing called
the American Revolution, Chon.

289
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,680
Never heard of it.

290
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,110
I'll give you the highlights.

291
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,080
They came over
with about a million men.

292
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,120
We had a bunch of farmers
with pitchforks

293
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,280
and beat 'em like a drum.

294
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,560
Hey! I'm walking here!

295
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,990
You're driving on the wrong side
of the road!

296
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,760
Bunch of amateurs.
These people don't get it.

297
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,600
Hello, ladies.

298
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,460
Look at you.

299
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,800
What? I'm not supposed to
notice a pretty lady?

300
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,340
I thought you wanted to
settle down and have a family.

301
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,710
I do, Chon.
I just hope I can.

302
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,840
Why not?

303
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,510
Sometimes I worry that
all the damn horseback riding

304
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,880
I did out in the West,

305
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,950
bouncing up and down on the
hard saddles might have made it

306
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,390
so my salmon don't swim upstream
the way they're supposed to.

307
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,520
What?

308
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,760
I might be shooting blanks.

309
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,860
Oh.

310
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,060
Don't say anything.

311
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,170
Roy, it's okay.

312
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,800
Some people are not meant
to have a family.

313
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,680
I've always had such a special
connection with children.

314
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,040
The little ankle biters.

315
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,210
Hey, watch it, you little punk!

316
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,120
Pardon me, guv.

317
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,890
You gents lost your way?

318
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,430
Yeah. We're looking for my sister.

319
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,260
She's staying at 32 Oxford Street.

320
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,490
I know it well, guv.
Me old man used to live there.

321
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,560
Can you show us the way?

322
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,630
Well, memory's a little dodgy.

323
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,140
But I'm sure for a bob
I could get you there.

324
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,940
What do you take us for?
Okies from Muskogee?

325
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,070
Go sell your bullshit
someplace else.

326
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,120
We're not buying.

327
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,840
Thanks for the tip, guv.

328
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,180
Hey! I stole that watch from my uncle!

329
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,520
What?

330
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,900
This way.

331
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,080
Come here,
you little rubbish eater!

332
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,280
What did I tell you about
poaching on our turf, Charlie?

333
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,480
I'm on the straight
and narrow. Honest.

334
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,830
What's this, then?

335
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,290
After I'm through beating you...

336
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,300
you're gonna wish you never
ran away from the workhouse!

337
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,960
Leave the boy alone.

338
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,900
Bloody tourists!
Get your noses out of it!

339
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,770
Do whatever you want to the kid...

340
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,540
but that's my watch you're holding.

341
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,070
Well, there's a load of us
and only two of you.

342
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,940
So piss off!

343
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,280
Easy, fellas.
You've lost one war this way.

344
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,250
Don't make the same mistake twice.

345
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,270
Come on!
After him!

346
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,840
Hey!

347
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,620
There he is!
Get him!

348
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,310
We've got him now.
Move in, lads.

349
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,580
Boys, boys, wait, wait!

350
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,290
Come on! Get him!

351
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,380
Up the bloody ladder!

352
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,420
Hey! Hey!

353
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,850
Oh! Watch it!

354
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,200
Hey.

355
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,230
Ah!

356
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,360
Come here, you!

357
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,520
Cool.

358
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,550
Move it!

359
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,990
You!

360
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,910
Did you see that?

361
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,600
It's okay.

362
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,770
Okay?!

363
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,510
I call that one
my kung pao chicken.

364
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,310
I clotheslined the sucker.

365
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,480
Come on, get back!

366
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,780
Clear away!

367
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,580
Make way!

368
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,700
I think you gentlemen should
accompany me back to the yard.

369
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,370
This isn't a yard!
It's a jail!

370
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,770
Roy, calm down.

371
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,340
Unbelievable.

372
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,410
Wait!
Someone's coming!

373
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,540
- Let me handle this.
- I'm gonna handle it, ok?

374
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,090
The English aren't like you.

375
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,350
They don't get all emotional.
Touchy-feely.

376
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,520
Do me a favor.

377
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,060
Park the kung fu.
Let me do the talking.

378
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,160
Come here.
Let me give you a hug.

379
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,670
Ooh!

380
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,230
I've been after that
Fleet Street gang for two years.

381
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,270
Then you two come along
and bring them down

382
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,210
in a single afternoon.
Brilliant!

383
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,900
Now, um...

384
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,310
Oh, that's my watch!

385
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,070
Yes. A street urchin turned it in.

386
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,210
The little punk better not
have scuffed it.

387
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,310
- I do hope your luck picks up.
- What do you mean "my luck"?

388
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,410
I deduced from your watch
that you'd hit a rough patch.

389
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,150
He has.
How do you know?

390
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,780
It's an investigative technique
I've developed.

391
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,120
I can deduce intimate details
about an individual

392
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,690
through a close scrutiny
of their personal effects.

393
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,600
What else can you tell?

394
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:34,530
The owner of this watch
is a bad gambler

395
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,040
and a lousy shot.

396
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,810
Although he's cheated death
several times...

397
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,410
he spends most of his life
wandering in a rather pathetic

398
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,350
and futile search
for purpose and respect.

399
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,550
Oh, yes.

400
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,610
He has a penchant for loose women.

401
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,520
Wow. That's amazing.

402
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,590
I'm sure it's a very popular
party trick

403
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,460
at birthdays for small children...

404
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,470
but it doesn't quite play
with adults.

405
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,030
Just to set the record straight.

406
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,760
Roy O'Bannon is not attracted
to loose women.

407
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,570
Loose women
are attracted to me.

408
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,770
- You're Roy O'Bannon?
- Yeah.

409
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,810
The famous Western folk hero?

410
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,040
Have you heard of me?

411
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,440
Have I heard of you?

412
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,880
I've only read "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy" five times.

413
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,180
It's fascinating.

414
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,980
I want you to meet the Shanghai Kid.

415
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,080
Oh, yes.

416
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,750
The faithful Chinese sidekick.

417
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,350
I'm not a sidekick.
Those stories are all lies.

418
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,330
Hey! Come on, don't be bitter.

419
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,890
I can't help what
Sage McCallister writes.

420
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,730
If there's anything I can do,
I'm at your service.

421
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,770
We're looking for my sister.
She's staying at this address.

422
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,770
Can you take us there?

423
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,780
Oh, dear.

424
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,310
I think you'd better come with me.

425
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,230
Lin.

426
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,810
Wang.

427
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,580
If you don't mind,
I'll just wait outside.

428
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,460
Introduce me.

429
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,650
Oh.
This is Lin, my baby sister.

430
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,120
Roy O'Bannon.

431
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,860
Pleasure.

432
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,330
You never told me your sister
was such a...

433
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,460
beautiful lotus blossom.

434
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,940
What'd she say?

435
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,280
No, no, no.

436
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,410
No talking about me
in your native tongue.

437
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,850
Why are you in jail?

438
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,750
I followed the man
who murdered Father.

439
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,050
And?

440
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,650
I found out where he live.

441
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,590
I snuck inside his house
and tried to kill him.

442
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,690
It's my duty to find
Father's killer.

443
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,430
No, it is mine!
I'm the one who promised Father.

444
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,870
But I'm his only son.

445
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,300
When you abandoned us
for America...

446
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,030
Father said he had no son.

447
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,510
What?

448
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,340
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Time out.

449
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,040
Time out. Time out.
Come here.

450
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,640
The detective's a fan.

451
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,580
Why don't I play
the celebrity card?

452
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,310
We'll get her out that way.

453
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,620
- Okay?
- Okay.

454
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,420
Don't worry.
I'll get you out.

455
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,820
Everything's gonna be okay.

456
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,130
In fact, I'm gonna give you
my good-luck playing cards.

457
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,340
Just ignore the naked ladies.

458
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,130
Wang!

459
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,070
Have you opened Father's box?

460
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,770
Not yet.

461
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,480
She tried to assassinate Lord Rathbone

462
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,960
whilst he was taking afternoon tea.

463
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,150
He's 10th in line to the throne...

464
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,160
Her Majesty's favorite cousin...

465
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,390
and the finest swordsman in England.

466
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,460
So, of course,
the press had a field day.

467
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,700
The story actually knocked Jack
the Ripper off the front page.

468
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,570
Artie, Lin is not a killer.

469
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,480
She's just a really, really, really hot...

470
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,450
confused Chinese girl.

471
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,780
Maybe if I agreed to sign
a few autographs

472
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,910
and talk to some of my fans
here in England...

473
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,510
do some type of charity event,
can we get her out that way?

474
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,520
I'm afraid
that's out of the question.

475
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,030
What will happen to my sister?

476
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,820
She'll go to trial,
probably be locked away

477
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,690
in an institution
for the criminally insane.

478
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,460
The tabloids have already
dubbed her "Loony Lin."

479
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,530
I thought it was rather catchy.

480
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,330
At the time.

481
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,220
Do you have any notion
what would happen

482
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,660
if we were to be seen together?

483
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,560
Since your return, I have yet to
lay eyes on the Imperial Seal.

484
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,900
I'm hosting a jubilee ball
at my country estate tomorrow.

485
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,340
Be at the stables at midnight.

486
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,600
As requested,
a token of my esteem.

487
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,320
This is where you get out.

488
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,080
I hope there will be
more trust between us

489
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,250
when I'm emperor
and you are the new king.

490
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,790
Wow. Buckingham Palace.
Look at that, Chon.

491
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,030
That's where the queen lives.

492
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,270
Hey, look at this guy.

493
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,110
He's a royal guard.
He has a very important job.

494
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,410
I used to be just like him.

495
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,110
No, they're nothing like you.

496
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,780
They're a tourist attraction.

497
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,840
You can make faces at them,
insult them...

498
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,180
and they can't move a muscle.

499
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,740
- Here. Watch this.
- Roy...

500
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,120
No, it's okay.

501
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,680
Hey, buddy,
your shoes are untied.

502
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,530
That is the biggest damn beaver
I have ever seen.

503
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,600
Roy, stop it.

504
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,600
The queen!

505
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,640
Look! The queen!

506
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,430
She's mooning us!

507
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,130
He almost went for that.

508
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,400
My friend and I just came over
from America.

509
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,170
You might have heard of it.
We run your jerkwater country.

510
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,410
Come on, you gonna take that
from a colonial?

511
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,540
Roy, stop it.

512
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,710
I bet you are one hell
of a damn poker player.

513
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,980
No hard feelings.

514
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,420
Huh?

515
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,420
They can't do that!

516
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,830
You're not allowed to do that!

517
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,960
Shouldn't have touched him.

518
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,060
You scram, you little punk.

519
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,660
I've got friends at Scotland Yard.

520
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,170
I'll give you up in a heartbeat.

521
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,730
You get your watch back?

522
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,240
Don't worry about my watch.
Go on.

523
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,470
It's a knockoff, you know.

524
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,980
What are you talking about?

525
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,810
My uncle stole this watch
from President Lincoln.

526
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,850
It's a priceless family heirloom.

527
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,940
Not according to the pawnbroker.

528
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,420
You should not steal.

529
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,680
If I don't steal, I don't eat.

530
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,780
Who showed you how to do
all that kicking and punching?

531
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,690
My father.

532
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,820
Have you ever heard of those?
They're parents.

533
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,730
You don't 'cause you're
a little orphan.

534
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,330
Now, go on.
You're cramping our style.

535
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,870
Oh, this country blows.

536
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,030
You need a place to stay?

537
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,610
Come on in and warm your dogs.

538
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,480
You can get into a lot of trouble

539
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,380
breaking into a place like this.

540
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,180
That being said, well done.

541
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,360
You just ate the last chocolate.

542
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,560
Course I did.

543
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,660
You gotta look out for number one.

544
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,360
I could really get used to this.

545
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,840
Living the life
of a country gentleman.

546
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,800
Maybe doing a little painting.

547
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,670
Let Lin play in the garden
with the children.

548
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,180
Vera, Chuck, and Dave.

549
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,680
Who's Lin?

550
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,380
Lin's the most beautiful woman
I've ever met.

551
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,650
She's gonna be the savior
of the house of O'Bannon.

552
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,520
Chon, check out the threads.

553
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,490
All I'm missing is the
loyal hound curled at my feet.

554
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,990
We are wasting time.
We must find Rathbone.

555
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,360
What do you think I've been doing?

556
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,420
Sitting here drinking expensive hooch?

557
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,490
Refill.

558
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,860
I've been working on a plan.

559
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,170
Now... Whoa.
Don't slosh the brandy.

560
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,610
- It messes with the bouquet.
- Sod off.

561
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,670
Listen, I'm trying to teach you
a skill set.

562
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,300
Help get you off the street.

563
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,340
- Bartenders make big bucks.
- Roy!

564
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,110
The plan.

565
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,910
Thank you, Chon.

566
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,150
Now I figure. If we find the seal...

567
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,250
we can prove Rathbone
killed your dad.

568
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,120
It's the old Hail Mary play.

569
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,490
I also have a version
where we dig a tunnel.

570
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,570
Hey!

571
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,830
Bloody catapult.
Jesus Christ!

572
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,130
- You don't need a catapult!
- Who asked you?

573
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,300
You don't interrupt grown-ups
when they're talking.

574
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,280
"Lord Nelson Rathbone requests
the pleasure of your company

575
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,440
at the jubilee ball

576
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,310
in honor of Her Majesty's
50th year on the throne."

577
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,820
Sounds good.

578
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,850
It doesn't address the issue of security.

579
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,580
They're not exactly gonna let
Chon and I

580
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,090
waltz into the castle.

581
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,620
All you need is a proper disguise.

582
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,990
I do like a good disguise.

583
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,910
I look like a fool.

584
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,890
What?! You're a maharaja.
That's Indian royalty.

585
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,160
- But I'm Chinese.
- It's the same thing.

586
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,320
Bob your head a little bit.

587
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,130
Gives you more
of a India-royalty flavor.

588
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,170
That's good.
Good show, good show.

589
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,430
Good show, good show.

590
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,030
- Cheerio, cheerio.
- Cheerio, cheerio.

591
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,840
What do we do
when we see Rathbone?

592
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:36,840
Kill him.

593
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,840
No, okay? No!

594
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,710
You're gonna be civil,
'cause we don't have the seal yet.

595
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,680
No seal. No Lin.
No family honor. Okay?

596
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,150
Be cool.
Okay, we look great.

597
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,710
Let's enjoy this party.

598
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,950
- Whoa. What are you doing?
- I'm going inside.

599
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,660
- The place is haunted.
- You're the harness man.

600
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,100
You get back at the carriage.

601
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,330
You wait in case we need
to make a quick getaway.

602
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,430
Go on.
Man your post.

603
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,060
You don't always get what you want.

604
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,570
Why are you so mean to that boy?

605
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,300
I see a lot of myself in that kid.

606
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,570
It's kind of freaking me out.
Come on.

607
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,750
Your name, please, sir.

608
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,990
So I can announce you.

609
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,930
Sherlock... Holmes.

610
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,840
Sherlock Holmes.

611
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,470
And which province do you represent,
Your Highness?

612
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,080
Nevada.

613
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,800
May I present
Major General Sherlock Holmes

614
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,870
and His Highness,
the maharaja of Nevada.

615
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,930
How are the security arrangements
this evening inspector?

616
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,160
Oh, everything seems to be
going swimmingly, my Lord.

617
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,430
And if I may say so...

618
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,130
it is an honor to guard
Your Lordship tonight.

619
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,640
I speak for all of us
at Scotland Yard

620
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,680
when I say that no matter how
far you are from the throne...

621
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,370
you'll always be number one
in our hearts.

622
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,050
Okay, here's the plan.

623
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,610
We're gonna get a little chow.

624
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,420
Then we're gonna sneak out of here.

625
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,920
- Start looking for that seal.
- Okay.

626
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,120
- Spotted Dick, sir?
- What?

627
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,920
Spotted Dick.

628
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,530
Can you believe this guy?

629
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,690
I'm trying to get something to eat.

630
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,630
He's asking me if I got the clap.

631
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,640
I think he's offering you food.

632
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,700
Oh. Spotted Dick.

633
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,240
Oh, no.
I think I'll pass.

634
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,740
I'm not really a dessert man.

635
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:30,110
Perhaps my friend might like
some Spotted Dick.

636
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,090
I might try one of these sausages.

637
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,920
A little smoky Joe.

638
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,850
Mmm! This is good!

639
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,020
I thought the food here
was supposed to suck.

640
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,290
The haggis is fresh from Scotland, sir.

641
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,090
It's made from
the finest sheeps' bladders.

642
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,300
I'm gonna get some whiskey
and wash my mouth out.

643
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,310
You should try the quail.

644
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,840
I shot them myself this morning.

645
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,920
How do you do, Your Lordship?

646
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,720
Very well, thank you.

647
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,120
I'm not acquainted
with the Nevada province.

648
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,860
But I haven't been to India since '81.

649
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,370
I spent most of my time in the Orient.

650
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,030
I hear you've just returned from China.

651
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,230
You are well-informed, maharaja.

652
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,540
It is my dream that the Chinese people

653
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:35,940
will follow India's example and
one day embrace British rule.

654
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,570
The Chinese are very proud.

655
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:41,110
They place family and honor
above all else.

656
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,620
Well, I'm sure
we can break them of that.

657
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,230
If you'll excuse me,
I have a matter to attend to.

658
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,630
Until we meet again.

659
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,810
Patience. Patience.
I'm proud of you, Chon.

660
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,370
We must find the seal.

661
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,110
What do you see?

662
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,150
Shh, shh, shh!

663
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,080
He just pulled a fancy
dragon key out of his desk.

664
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,620
That was my father's!

665
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,180
I must avenge his honor.

666
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,660
Hey, slow down, tiger.
Slow down.

667
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,200
Quit going all Chinese on me.

668
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,190
Where is he?

669
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,970
Damn it, Chon.
Remember your puzzle box. Patience.

670
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,400
Okay, there are no windows.

671
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,500
We just came in
through the only doorway.

672
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,240
That leaves one explanation.

673
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,080
Remember in "Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy"

674
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,310
how the zombie king got away

675
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,210
when I chased him into the pharaoh's tomb?

676
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,010
There's a secret passageway
behind the sphinx.

677
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,450
There's gotta be a lever
or a button over here.

678
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,550
Help me lift some stuff up.

679
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,460
Roy!

680
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,910
The painting.
It's looking at me.

681
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,240
- Look!
- Oh, yeah.

682
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,400
Looks like it's looking at me, too.
That's great.

683
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,640
No, real eyes.
Moving!

684
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,080
Oh Chon,
that kid got you, didn't he?

685
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,420
Unbelievable!
We're not in a haunted house.

686
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,550
That's a technique that an artist uses.

687
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,610
"Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant
eyes" is the technical term.

688
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,680
It's unnerving, though.
I'll give you that.

689
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,740
Roy.
Now, those eyes. Look!

690
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,240
Whatever you say, Chon.

691
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,170
Let's see what you got here,
Rathbone.

692
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,750
Roy!

693
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,110
What, Chon?
Are the statues moving now?

694
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,690
Wow.

695
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,230
Mm-mmm!

696
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,860
Roy!

697
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,800
I can't hear myself think
with you shouting at me, Chon.

698
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,090
Chon?

699
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,340
Chon? Chon?

700
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,910
This is ridiculous.

701
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,610
Chon, if you want to act
like a child and play little games...

702
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,150
then find someone else, ok...

703
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,610
'cause I take
this stuff seriously.

704
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,480
I'm here to work.
I'm on a mission.

705
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,480
Chon?

706
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,350
Okay, Chon.

707
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,490
Okay, you little Chinese otter.

708
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,890
Let's play.

709
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,190
Ha!

710
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:28,740
Chon, demons!

711
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,500
She's gonna fight my battles for me.

712
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,300
Come on.
Let's go.

713
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,960
What? What are you doing?

714
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,600
It's kinky.
I like it.

715
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:09,150
Wow! Look at this.

716
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,050
Wait. There's something
different about this room.

717
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,400
Hey.

718
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,090
Let's go!

719
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,200
- Wang!
- Chon, for God's sakes.

720
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,470
- Now he shows up.
- I found it.

721
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,440
Wait. Do you want to hear?

722
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,000
The seal's gone.

723
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,940
Lin.

724
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,740
Roy!

725
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,740
Are we gonna come back?

726
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,580
Roy!

727
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,690
Must you keep doing that?

728
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,930
I was taught
not to be seen or heard.

729
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,530
The seal.

730
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,330
I am a man of my word.

731
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,670
I remember watching
my brother play with this

732
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,210
like a baby rattle.

733
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,610
When I'd try to touch it,
the dowager empress beat me.

734
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,680
No doubt your deprived childhood

735
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,020
made you into the man you are today.

736
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,220
Wu Chow.

737
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,890
Wu who?

738
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,260
He is the emperor's bastard brother.

739
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:46,770
He was banished
from the Forbidden City

740
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,670
for trying to steal the Imperial Seal.

741
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,030
Our father caught him.

742
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,070
He vowed to return to claim
the emperor's throne.

743
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,870
This guy?

744
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,470
I'll assume everything
has been arranged as discussed.

745
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,450
You have nothing to worry about.
It's all in place.

746
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,580
That diamond is as big
as a damn monkey's paw.

747
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,180
- Look at that.
- Roy.

748
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,880
Don't even think about it.

749
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,690
I'm just admiring
the craftsmanship, Chon.

750
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,130
So for now,
our business is completed.

751
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,100
Where's Lin?!

752
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,480
Hey! Hey!

753
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,920
Gotcha!

754
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,030
Just looking out for number one.

755
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,930
No!

756
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,130
The kid got the seal!

757
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,280
Chon!

758
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,620
It's stuck.

759
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,870
Lin!

760
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,310
Go! You can do it!

761
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,750
She's got it.

762
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,880
She's got it!

763
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,390
Roy! Come on!

764
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,890
Chon, what in our history together

765
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,430
makes you think I'm capable
of something like that?

766
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,090
- Roy!
- I can't do that!

767
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,030
Hurry up!

768
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,090
Wait.

769
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,860
There's a better way.

770
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:15,510
Slow down!

771
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,020
I'm a bat out of hell!

772
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,810
Yee-haw!

773
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,250
Besides, I don't know
where the brake is.

774
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,310
What?!

775
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,860
Look out!

776
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,410
So, what now, buddy?

777
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,890
Relax, relax.
Smooth sailing from here.

778
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,290
Yes, these are the men
who attacked me.

779
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,600
I'm afraid the assailants have
temporarily eluded us, my Lord.

780
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,610
Perhaps you could explain to me

781
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,730
how Loony Lin managed to escape

782
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,470
from the confines of
Scotland Yard under the watch

783
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,980
of the most respected
police force in the world.

784
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,180
Yes, of course.
It's absolutely fascinating.

785
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,350
She picked the lock

786
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,820
using a deck of rather
risque playing cards.

787
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:36,160
Then scaled the walls
with a mop, a fork...

788
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,660
and various pilfered undergarments.

789
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,390
You've got to hand it to the Chinese.

790
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,060
They're awfully ingenious,
Lord, aren't they?

791
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,770
Does your incompetence know
no bounds?!

792
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,130
Where am I?

793
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:21,500
Lin!

794
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,740
I don't even know these women.

795
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:30,710
Lin, what are you doing here?

796
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,510
Oh, Lord.

797
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,450
Do you want to try
the position on page 37?

798
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,830
Come here, you little minx.

799
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,670
What?

800
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,210
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

801
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,650
I've just been violated
by a barnyard animal.

802
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:11,350
Who would leave a pile of stones
in the middle of the field?

803
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,490
I don't know, Chon.
These people are nuts.

804
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,460
Come on.

805
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,960
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

806
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,370
This is a hell
of a damn adventure we're on.

807
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,670
I'm having
an absolute ball with you.

808
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,510
Me too.

809
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,150
Here we go.

810
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,050
Get your thumb out, maharaja.

811
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,610
- Why?
- Get over here.

812
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,390
Excuse me!

813
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,660
- Lin!
- Lin!

814
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,230
My shoulder's getting
a little tight.

815
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:03,930
This is your first time
in England, isn't it?

816
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,850
How do you know your way around?
It's incredible.

817
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:10,350
I always had a good sense
of direction.

818
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,280
You can say that again.

819
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,690
I wish we could say the same
about you-know-who.

820
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,450
I once sent him over a mountain range.

821
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,920
He was lost forever.

822
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:22,650
One time, I sent him
over the Great Wall.

823
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:26,460
- He was lost for three days.
- Three days?!

824
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,870
Oh, gosh, we got a lot in common.

825
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:33,370
I've never met
anybody like you, Roy.

826
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

827
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:40,080
Hey, can I tell you something
without you getting offended?

828
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,440
What?

829
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,640
You have a great body.

830
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,650
There. I said it.
It's out in the open.

831
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:52,580
- You must work out.
- Me?

832
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:53,820
Excuse me.

833
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,460
Chon, what are you doing?

834
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,930
I don't like the backseat.

835
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:04,300
Makes me sick. Dizzy.

836
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,970
Whitechapel.

837
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,480
This looks like
a nice enough neighborhood.

838
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,250
- What is Puss 'n' Boots?
- It's a boardinghouse.

839
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,690
Some of the sailors on the ship
coming over recommended it.

840
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,690
Come on. Come on!

841
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,640
I won't let my sister stay here.

842
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:43,840
What are we supposed to do?
Check in to the Savoy?

843
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,740
We'll get arrested
before we get to our room.

844
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,470
I don't mind this place.

845
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:55,320
See?
She's a little open-minded.

846
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,860
I know this sounds crazy
'cause I just met her...

847
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,720
but I think I'm falling for her.

848
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,020
I think she's the one.

849
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,820
Roy, she's my baby sister.

850
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,960
I know she is.
Thank God!

851
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,430
That's the only chance
I've got.

852
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,470
Look, I'm getting ready
to launch a little thing

853
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,300
called "Operation:
Sweep Her Off Her Feet."

854
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,430
You're in a position to talk me up.

855
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,840
Can I count on you?

856
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,970
Please, buddy, I've never
asked you for anything.

857
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,410
Sure, Roy.
I'll tell her the truth.

858
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,840
Don't get hung up on the truth.

859
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:23,470
Feel free to smooth out
your old pal's rough edges.

860
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:27,650
I love you, buddy.

861
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,050
Lin. Come.

862
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,130
Sit.

863
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,160
Hello, love.

864
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,630
Fancy a tumble?

865
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,890
Oh!
Where were you two days ago?

866
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:14,160
I would have bedded you
in a second.

867
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,860
Now you're looking
at a changed man.

868
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,930
I'm sort of saving myself
for someone special.

869
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:20,870
I'll give you a discount.

870
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:26,450
That's the most romantic thing
any woman's ever said to me.

871
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,710
You better go.

872
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,910
You better go
before we lose control. Go!

873
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,150
If you change your mind...

874
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,280
Roy!

875
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,060
Lin. Our father would talk about
the right man for you.

876
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:49,100
He must be strong, courageous...

877
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,730
and a good father.

878
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,170
- Like Roy.
- We got her, Chon.

879
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,000
Not like Roy.

880
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,840
You don't know him like I do.

881
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,810
He has many bad habits.

882
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:02,010
Such as?

883
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,880
He drinks, smokes, and he gambles.

884
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,540
Chon, where are you going with this?

885
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,550
He sleeps with women for money.

886
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,880
What are you...

887
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,890
Roy don't do that.
I can see inside him.

888
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,360
He has a good heart.

889
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,520
That's right.

890
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,000
His salmon don't swim upstream.

891
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,360
He shoots blanks.

892
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:26,200
Lin, he cannot be trusted.

893
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:29,760
How could you say that?
You're his friend.

894
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,310
Yeah, sort of.

895
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,810
Roy is the type of a friend

896
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,210
you'd never introduce
to your other friends

897
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,050
or bring home to your family.

898
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,850
He never speak the truth.
You know what I call him?

899
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,790
Not Roy O'Bannon.
Roy O'Baloney.

900
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,020
I don't care.

901
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,190
Lin, I forbid it.

902
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,250
You are not my father.

903
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,140
Roy, there you are.

904
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,740
- Hi.
- Mm-hmm.

905
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:10,910
You need anything, buddy?

906
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,080
A whole lot of
"leave me alone."

907
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,990
What's wrong?

908
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,260
Nothing.

909
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,260
I woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

910
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,490
I feel a little pain in my back
like someone put a knife there.

911
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,330
I'm okay.

912
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,230
Don't worry about me.

913
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,340
Roy!

914
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,380
Ta-da!

915
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,720
That actually reminds me of a trick.

916
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,780
You ever seen this one?!

917
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,950
Or this one?!

918
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:56,690
You think you're so cool
with your karate

919
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,360
and your childlike reflexes.

920
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,170
Roy, you okay?

921
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,960
Look at you.

922
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,940
Do you really call me Roy Baloney?

923
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,770
Roy, you don't understand.

924
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:16,710
You just smashed my puzzle box.

925
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,840
I'll never figure out my message.

926
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,750
- Roy...
- Go.

927
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,590
You're dead to me.

928
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:28,060
I don't know a Chon Wang.

929
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,070
What?

930
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,370
Hi, Roy.

931
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,210
Who loves you, baby?

932
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,940
- Nice try, Chon.
- Roy...

933
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,680
I'm sorry.

934
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,760
You do that again,
and you're a dead man.

935
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,600
Pillow fight!

936
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:41,890
I am Roy Baloney!

937
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:42,960
Yes!

938
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,030
I'm full of it!

939
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,400
You are!

940
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,430
Roy?

941
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,130
Roy?

942
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:21,210
Lin!

943
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,080
It was his idea.

944
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,680
- Chon!
- Clothes!

945
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,940
Nice night for a walk.

946
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:14,690
Lin!

947
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,230
- Lin!
- There you are!

948
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,290
What are you doing?

949
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,030
Don't you know there's
a serial killer on the loose?

950
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,860
Forget it.

951
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,670
Who the hell are these guys?

952
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,680
Boxers.

953
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,180
What do they want with us?

954
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,480
They're with me.

955
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:42,320
I think we need to have a little chat.

956
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,960
Chon Wang...

957
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:56,800
the man who can fight an emperor.

958
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:59,530
The emperor should never have
his burial knife.

959
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,270
I see.

960
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,780
You're still my brother's lapdog.

961
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,670
I'm here not for him.

962
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,570
I'm here for my father.

963
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,510
Of course you are.

964
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:17,210
It was my dagger
that plunged into his heart.

965
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,280
It's still crusted with his blood.

966
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,500
I know the boy has the seal.

967
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,730
Where is he?

968
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,890
We don't know.

969
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,870
That's the truth...
we don't know.

970
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,770
Mmm...

971
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,240
What are you...
What are you doing?

972
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,770
Stop! Put her down!

973
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:44,370
Put her down!
Put her down!

974
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:46,210
Or what, Mr. O'Bannon?

975
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:48,650
Are you gonna kick my ass?

976
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,990
I've read all about
your ridiculous exploits.

977
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,490
I mean, just...

978
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,830
how does it feel to kill
a mummy with your bare hands?

979
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:00,090
Only a nation
of uneducated rednecks

980
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,800
would be amused by such cowboy drivel.

981
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:04,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.

982
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,270
What's with the personal attacks?

983
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,040
You don't see me
making any comments

984
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:12,510
about your pasty complexion
or your snotty accent

985
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:15,600
or even your filthy, smutty sex books.

986
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,670
Yeah, I saw your book.
It disgusted me.

987
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,720
Oh, why is it always the head
with you people?!

988
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:27,090
Hold it! Stop! Hold it!

989
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,250
Just hold it!

990
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:31,260
What are we doing here?
Guys, look at this.

991
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:33,990
We're acting like animals...
over what?

992
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:35,290
Some seal?

993
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,930
The seal represents imperial power.

994
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,400
I will use it to unite
the emperor's enemies

995
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:44,440
and storm the Forbidden City.

996
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,940
What's in it for you?

997
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:48,240
You're looking
at the future king of England.

998
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:50,210
You're, like, 20th in line to the throne.

999
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,550
10th.

1000
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,740
But my friend is about to change all that

1001
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:57,190
by simple...
process of elimination.

1002
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,420
It's called a machine gun.

1003
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,800
The first of its kind...
it fires 200 rounds a minute.

1004
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:09,160
Testament to British ingenuity.

1005
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,070
Oh, so you steal the seal,

1006
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,230
and then you knock off nine royals?

1007
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:18,570
You got the short end
of that stick, my friend.

1008
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:24,110
Dump them in the river.

1009
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,420
Where are you taking her?

1010
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,350
To make history.

1011
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,620
I can already see the headlines...

1012
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:35,860
"Nation mourns as Loony Lin
massacres royal family."

1013
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:54,180
I need your assurance
that you will find the seal.

1014
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,910
Don't concern yourself.

1015
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,970
My men are scouring the city.

1016
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:03,110
You better pray they find it...
or our agreement is over,

1017
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:07,560
and you will never get the crown.

1018
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,030
Chon, I got a confession to make.

1019
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,300
You are in love with my sister.

1020
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:21,360
Well, that, but...

1021
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,170
I didn't lose all the money
on the zeppelins.

1022
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,640
No?

1023
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:30,010
Nah. I blew most of it
on the Roy O'Bannon novels.

1024
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,570
I wrote them.

1025
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,210
No, Sage McCallister wrote them.

1026
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:36,480
That's what I'm saying, buddy.
I'm Sage McCallister.

1027
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,980
You wrote those lies?!

1028
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,960
I've always had low self-esteem.

1029
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,500
How many books did you print?

1030
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:48,730
I self-published probably a million copies.

1031
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,770
We were actually second
to the Bible that year.

1032
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,700
Oh, you...

1033
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:54,900
I guess I'm just about
the worst friend

1034
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,100
a guy could ask for.

1035
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:01,840
No, you're a good friend.

1036
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,010
Thank you.

1037
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,480
If you really love Lin,
I won't stand in the way.

1038
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,640
Really?

1039
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,920
But if you break her heart...
I'll break your legs.

1040
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,150
That's fair.

1041
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:17,890
Well,
friends to the end, Chon...

1042
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,630
and this is the end.

1043
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,770
Chon, you got a plan?

1044
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,330
You wouldn't happen to have
a plan, would you?

1045
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,430
Yes.

1046
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,300
- Anything I can do?
- No.

1047
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,210
Good. I'll let you do
the heavy lifting, then.

1048
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,030
Chon, hurry.

1049
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,570
Chon!

1050
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,690
Chon! Chon, hurry!

1051
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,930
Hurry!

1052
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,700
Hurry! Chon, hurry!

1053
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:01,760
Roy!

1054
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,110
Coming!

1055
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,810
Chon!

1056
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,140
Oh!

1057
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,040
The water's so dirty!

1058
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,250
No! No! It's dirty! No!

1059
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,420
Just go ahead and drown me.
I don't care anymore.

1060
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:52,660
Roy!

1061
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:54,390
You look ridiculous.

1062
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:57,580
I think we look good.

1063
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:02,990
I really must protest
this intrusion.

1064
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,190
Every bobby in London is out
scouring the streets

1065
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:07,200
for you two.

1066
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,670
Have you been drinking?

1067
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:12,100
I always drink when my
employment's been terminated.

1068
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:13,230
They fired you?

1069
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:15,240
Lord Rathbone saw to that.

1070
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:16,300
I'm sorry.

1071
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,870
It's of no consequence.

1072
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:22,310
I never wanted to be
an inspector in the first place.

1073
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,820
It was my father's idea.

1074
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,080
I always wanted to be a writer.

1075
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,280
Yeah.

1076
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,120
Artie, we need your help.

1077
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,750
Rathbone has taken Lin.

1078
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,290
He's gonna kill the royal family

1079
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,790
and he's gonna assume the throne.

1080
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,330
Do you have any evidence

1081
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,420
to support these
preposterous allegations?

1082
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,160
We have this.
It's the boy's.

1083
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,000
Use your technique.
Tell us where he is.

1084
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,440
Paraffin wax...
most interesting.

1085
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:52,940
He's at a church.

1086
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,810
The little punk's hiding
in a church.

1087
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,400
No, no, no.

1088
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,420
It's not candle wax.

1089
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,610
I have it.

1090
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,190
- Don't worry. You'll get it.
- What are you doing?

1091
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,190
- He's picking the lock.
- Well, hurry up!

1092
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,520
Chon, please! Please.
It's a very meticulous process.

1093
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,030
Let Artie do his job.
It's almost an art form.

1094
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,230
It takes the precision
of a surgeon.

1095
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,530
You have to be so precise.

1096
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,940
Maybe if we jam
another one in there.

1097
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,940
That works, too.

1098
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:29,210
Lacks a certain finesse.

1099
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:34,950
All right, all right.
Let's split up.

1100
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,780
What the...

1101
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,930
I am gonna break your neck.

1102
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:49,790
Come here.

1103
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:31,840
Looky here.

1104
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,030
- Come on, where is it?
- What?

1105
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,730
You know
what I'm talking about.

1106
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:37,210
Don't give me that "what."

1107
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:39,240
What do we got here?

1108
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:40,970
Oh, yes.

1109
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:44,410
You don't mind
if I take this back, do you?

1110
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,040
Go on.
Get out of here.

1111
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,050
Go!

1112
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,090
Roy?

1113
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:49,350
I got it.

1114
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,120
Give me the seal.

1115
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,260
Give me the seal!

1116
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:12,170
All right, spread out!

1117
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,400
Through there!

1118
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,110
Let's go.

1119
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,280
The gig's up.

1120
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,660
So, what are we gonna do?

1121
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,740
Come on, think!

1122
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,070
I'm not going
to an English prison.

1123
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:48,010
With my feathery blond hair
and Chon's athletic build,

1124
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,010
they'll try to make us
the belle of the ball.

1125
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,140
Forget it.
I'm not going back.

1126
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:56,680
Well, at least we'll get
a good view of the fireworks

1127
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,020
from Scotland Yard.

1128
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,990
- Fireworks?
- Yeah.

1129
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:02,490
At midnight, they're launching
this huge display

1130
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,320
from a flotilla of barges
on the Thames.

1131
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,300
It's the official kickoff
to the Queen's Jubilee.

1132
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,270
Is the royal family gonna be there?

1133
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,770
They're gonna be viewing
the spectacle from a balcony

1134
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,330
overlooking the river.

1135
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,370
He's got a machine gun on the barge.

1136
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,230
Yes.

1137
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,220
You gents lost your way?

1138
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:31,850
Kid, tell me
you got a way out.

1139
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,060
Nice move, kid.

1140
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,540
So why did you come back?

1141
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:51,200
Why did you give up the seal?

1142
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:55,540
'Cause I'm a fool.

1143
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,910
Guess I'm a fool, too.

1144
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:01,140
Well, put her there, fool.

1145
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,510
I never got your name.

1146
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:05,720
Name's Chaplin...

1147
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:07,820
Charlie Chaplin.

1148
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,810
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1149
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:10,980
Excuse me, please!

1150
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,890
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1151
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:22,790
You warn the royal family.

1152
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:23,890
I'll save Lin.

1153
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,830
How on earth are you gonna do that?

1154
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,520
You okay?

1155
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,000
I just saved you!

1156
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:03,160
You were late!

1157
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,220
What?!

1158
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,100
Nelson?

1159
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:24,990
Why are you hiding yourself
back there?

1160
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,290
I shouldn't like to impede
your view, Your Highness.

1161
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,220
Nonsense.
You arranged all this.

1162
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:31,160
You should have a front-row view.

1163
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:34,760
I regret that, uh,
respectfully I must decline.

1164
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:37,500
I need to keep a good eye
on proceedings.

1165
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:42,170
Whoo!

1166
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,640
Nelson,
you've outdone yourself.

1167
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:47,180
Wait till you see the finale.

1168
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,140
Hey!

1169
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:57,220
Hey!

1170
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:03,550
Oh!

1171
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:09,860
This is hopeless.

1172
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:11,860
We're not gonna get past the guards.

1173
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,520
Well, not with that attitude we won't.

1174
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,500
Come on, Artie.
There's got to be a way.

1175
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:17,560
There's always...

1176
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:32,310
Lin!

1177
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:10,550
Yee-haw! Yeah!

1178
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,320
Yee-haw!

1179
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,790
Yee-haw!

1180
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:17,490
We got to jump it!

1181
01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:10,310
Wu Chow!

1182
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:29,200
Hold it right there,
Rathboner.

1183
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,530
I'm guessing
by your hasty retreat

1184
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:36,040
that you're still
20th in line for the throne.

1185
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:37,340
10th.

1186
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:39,740
Inspector Doyle, arrest this man.

1187
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:44,440
He's got a gun!

1188
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,110
Oh!

1189
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:48,370
Come on!

1190
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:51,710
- Oh!
- You okay?

1191
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:53,050
What happened?

1192
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,520
Rathbone nailed Artie
with a little sissy gun.

1193
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:57,890
I'll look after him.
You two go.

1194
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,730
Go!

1195
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:09,160
For Father.

1196
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,140
For Father.

1197
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,940
For Old Man Wang.

1198
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:20,240
Oh, my lucky playing cards.

1199
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:30,490
Be careful.

1200
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,400
Tell Rathbone to be careful.

1201
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:35,430
Roy, let's go.

1202
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:44,400
You're gonna need a bigger gun!

1203
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:03,690
You see him?

1204
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,160
No.

1205
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:07,130
Show your face, Rathbone!

1206
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,630
I'm gonna tear this guy apart.

1207
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:11,100
Roy, you go this way.
I'll go that way.

1208
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:13,830
Split up? I don't know
if that's a good idea.

1209
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:15,070
It's okay.

1210
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,250
He's not up here.

1211
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,580
Roy, keep going.

1212
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:35,250
Aw, come on, Roy.

1213
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:50,540
Hey, uh, Rathbone...

1214
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:53,870
I was just thinking
of a title for my new book...

1215
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:57,640
"Roy O'Bannon vs. Little Lord Sissy."

1216
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:01,340
But what about "Roy O'Bannon vs.
The Man Who Would Be Queen"?

1217
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,990
No sign of him, Chon.

1218
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,220
The coast is clear up here.

1219
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,420
Roy! Look out!

1220
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,060
Roy!

1221
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:20,400
Oops.

1222
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,840
Come on up.

1223
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:28,040
I'll show you how your father died.

1224
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:10,310
Lord, help me.

1225
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:12,980
Just let me know you're there.
Love me. Hate me.

1226
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:15,320
But let me know you're up there!

1227
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,660
Hey, I can see our hotel from here.

1228
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:18,820
Wow.

1229
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:33,510
Come along.

1230
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,310
I'm waiting.

1231
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:38,610
Come on, Roy. Okay.

1232
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,780
Roy O'Bannon will not go quietly.

1233
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,180
You hear that, England?!

1234
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:44,020
Throw whatever you want at me...

1235
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:47,020
your terrible weather,
your perverted killers,

1236
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:49,060
your Spotted Dick!

1237
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:27,520
Roy, you're about to die.

1238
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,070
You're on the minute hand of a clock.

1239
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:33,660
My life is flashing before my eyes.

1240
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:36,730
Wait a minute.
I don't remember her.

1241
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,320
One more.

1242
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:09,700
One more.

1243
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,530
Oh!

1244
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:40,860
How disappointing.

1245
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:45,060
One more.

1246
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,290
You killed my friend.

1247
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:06,890
You killed my father!

1248
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:28,740
Roy!

1249
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:31,250
I thought you were dead!
Oh!

1250
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,810
You think some tea-drinking psycho

1251
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:35,860
can take out Roy O'Bannon?

1252
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:48,500
Whoa.

1253
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:50,560
Easy there, cowboy.

1254
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:55,010
Huh?

1255
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,460
You got any ideas?

1256
01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:16,020
Huh?

1257
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,630
- We jump!
- Jump?!

1258
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:24,540
You mean fall?!

1259
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:26,370
Aim for the flag!

1260
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,040
Aw, shit.

1261
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:31,040
I got to tell you something.

1262
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,210
What?

1263
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,180
You're the best sidekick
I could ever ask for.

1264
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:38,420
Thank you, Roy.
I feel the same about you.

1265
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,020
On three.

1266
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:42,250
One...

1267
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:43,690
Two...

1268
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:44,490
- Three!
- Three!

1269
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:12,860
Roy. Roy!

1270
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:17,920
Howdy.

1271
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:24,690
In recognition of outstanding bravery,

1272
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:27,930
I dub you Sir Chon Wang.

1273
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,380
For uncommon valor,

1274
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:38,880
I dub you Sir Roy O'Bannon.

1275
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:48,050
And for steadfast dedication to justice,

1276
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:51,320
I dub you Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

1277
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:58,430
Arise.

1278
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,580
Who loves you, baby?

1279
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,660
Madam.

1280
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:39,140
Artie, I bet Scotland Yard's
dying to get you back now.

1281
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:41,410
My official
crime-fighting days are over.

1282
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,610
The queen has asked me

1283
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,980
to accompany the Imperial Seal
back to China.

1284
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:46,480
What a week.
Unbelievable.

1285
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:48,490
She couldn't have picked
a better man, right, Chon?

1286
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:49,610
Yeah.

1287
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:52,680
And the voyage is gonna give me
time to work on my new novel.

1288
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:54,990
It features a new kind of detective,

1289
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:58,030
and he's gonna solve crimes
using deductive reasoning.

1290
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,690
Give me a name.
What's his name?

1291
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:01,250
Actually, Roy,
I was rather hoping

1292
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:03,990
to call him Sherlock Holmes,
if that's all right with you.

1293
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,100
I'd be insulted if you didn't use it.

1294
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:16,250
- Ta.
- See you, Artie.

1295
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:20,580
That was very nice of you, Roy.

1296
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,950
I would've kept the name
if I thought it was any good.

1297
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:24,610
It's a horrible name
for a detective...

1298
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:26,850
Sherlock Holmes. Holmes?

1299
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,290
Will you stop playing with that?
I'm gonna smash it.

1300
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:31,590
I just want to see it for a second.

1301
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,690
- Just let me see it.
- No, you're gonna break it.

1302
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:37,800
It's just a rock
with some gibberish on it.

1303
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:39,360
That's Chinese.

1304
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:43,300
"Family is forever, my son.

1305
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:46,210
I'm proud
you cast your own stone."

1306
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:48,540
Wow.

1307
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,170
That's a good message.

1308
01:43:57,190 --> 01:44:00,390
I'd like to cast my own stone, Chon.

1309
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

1310
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:17,300
I told you... the house
of O'Bannon will prevail.

1311
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:25,380
Chon, I got a business
proposition for you.

1312
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,310
No more zeppelins.

1313
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:29,180
No, no, this is much better
than zeppelins...

1314
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:31,080
a new thing they're starting
out in California

1315
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,590
called moving pictures.

1316
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:33,650
Pass.

1317
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,280
Hold it. Hold it.
Hear me out.

1318
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,730
I really think these movies
could play to your strength.

1319
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,730
There's no sound,

1320
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,890
so we don't have to worry
about the language problem.

1321
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:44,730
And I think the kung fu stuff
could be huge.

1322
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,960
People are dying
for a good action picture.

1323
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,630
What do you think?

1324
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:51,640
Chon Wang, movie star?

1325
01:44:51,710 --> 01:44:53,140
It could work.

1326
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:56,480
I feel bad about ditching
that Chaplin kid,

1327
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:58,910
but we're gonna be running
and gunning in Hollywood,

1328
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:01,450
and he'd just cramp our style.

1329
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:03,650
It's such a tough town.

1330
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,140
Bloody tourists!

1331
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:23,710
Action!

1332
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:42,190
You have to say "cut."

1333
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:45,620
You just keep looking!

1334
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:49,060
Ouch.

1335
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:55,500
Come here, you little minx.

1336
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:56,800
Cut.

1337
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:58,310
That was good.

1338
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:00,040
That was a good one, huh?

1339
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:05,070
Maybe on this one
I should lick you... you think?

1340
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:08,210
Like, after you lick me...
that could be kind of good.

1341
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:10,080
And, Jackie...

1342
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:11,280
Jackie?

1343
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,220
Thank you. Hi, Owen.

1344
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:14,420
Hello. How are you?

1345
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:16,930
Okay, and I'm not
Roy O'Bannon.

1346
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:18,120
Who are you?

1347
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,590
Damn it, Chon,
I think she's the one.

1348
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:24,260
I know it's crazy.
We just met, but she's the one.

1349
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:27,170
No, Roy,
she's my babysitter.

1350
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:30,930
Your babys...

1351
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,600
What?

1352
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,110
Baby what?

1353
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,340
Baby sister.

1354
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:36,940
Baby sister?

1355
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:39,280
Not babysitter.
Baby sister.

1356
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,120
You okay?

1357
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:55,790
Action!

1358
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:00,230
What happened?

1359
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,930
Roy is the type of a friend
you never introduce

1360
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:05,740
to your other friends
or bring into your family.

1361
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:09,410
He's... Look at his eyes.
They're brown... full of shit.

1362
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,240
Always...

1363
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,250
Just bullshit all the time.

1364
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,880
Yeah, have you ever heard of those?

1365
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:17,420
They're parents.
We have parents that love us.

1366
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:19,920
You don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

1367
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:24,920
You don't...
We've got par... Yeah, parents.

1368
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,430
Have you ever heard of those?
We've got parents that love us.

1369
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:30,260
But you don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

1370
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,400
Oh, go on.

1371
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,810
So mean.

1372
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:40,110
Chon Wang, movie star?

1373
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:41,440
It could work.

1374
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:44,280
It could work.
You could do your own stunts.

1375
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:46,110
What? My own stunts?

1376
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:51,290
Ow!

1377
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:53,880
Whoa! Whoa!

1378
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:58,620
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

1379
01:47:58,730 --> 01:48:00,820
Ouch! Oh!

1380
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:02,630
Ow. That hurt.

1381
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,900
Ow! Ooh!

1382
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,340
Ow!

1383
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:15,740
Oh!

1384
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,480
You're supposed to catch me!

1385
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:22,710
Roy, catch.

1386
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:32,160
- Jesus.
- That's my fault.

1387
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:33,630
Wait a second.

1388
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:36,130
This nut is killing
your street women?

1389
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,300
Who did that?

1390
01:48:42,370 --> 01:48:43,360
Jackie Chan.

1391
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,430
Me?

1392
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:45,770
That's right.

1393
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:49,170
- That was the...
- First time.

1394
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:51,180
- The best take.
- I'm sorry.

1395
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:52,550
Hurry up!

1396
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:54,280
Are you crazy?!
I can't do that!

1397
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:56,790
This isn't Chinatown!
I can't sail through the air!

1398
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:58,790
- I'm not gonna break my neck!
- Roy!

1399
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:00,150
What in our history together

1400
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:02,720
makes you think I'm capable
of something like that?

1401
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:03,730
It's getting bigger!

1402
01:49:03,790 --> 01:49:04,890
There's got to be
a better way.

1403
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:05,790
Roy!

1404
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,300
Roy!

1405
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:11,960
My ass is on fire.
