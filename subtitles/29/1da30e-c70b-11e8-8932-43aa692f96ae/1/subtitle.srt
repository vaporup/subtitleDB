00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:52,896
<i>Can you love me</i>
<i>with a thousand eyes?</i>

2
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,149
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>right through my bones?</i>

3
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:57,401
I need a doctor!

4
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:59,194
I'll get you a vet,
you son of a bitch!

5
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:01,029
You should have
shot him first!

6
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:05,158
<i>We've got two</i>
<i>clowns headed south on Wall 51!</i>

7
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,910
<i>Four miles from the border.</i>

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,496
And stop bleeding
on my money!

9
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,501
<i>All units, be advised.</i>

10
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:16,670
<i>Suspects are</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

11
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:23,468
What the fuck!

12
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,554
<i>Well, hello,</i>
<i>boys and girls.</i>

13
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:27,848
<i>There's nothing worse</i>
<i>than a sad clown.</i>

14
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:29,808
<i>Unless it's a clown</i>
<i>bleeding internally</i>

15
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,185
<i>and coughing it</i>
<i>all over your money.</i>

16
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:34,563
<i>Well, I suppose</i>
<i>this summer vacation</i>

17
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:36,523
<i>with a big haul</i>
<i>south of the border,</i>

18
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,567
<i>was out of the question now.</i>

19
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,069
<i>But like my old mother</i>
<i>always told me,</i>

20
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,654
<i>"Fuck off, loser."</i>

21
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:48,285
<i>Let your world spin free</i>

22
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:53,040
<i>Let it go,</i>
<i>I'll do the same</i>

23
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,960
<i>The jewels will</i>
<i>shine on me</i>

24
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,325
...gringo border patrols
in pursuit

25
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,110
Bill!

26
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:46,653
Holy shit!

27
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:48,947
The circus came to town!

28
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,284
Vazquez, I'll tell you what.

29
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,161
We'll take care of this.

30
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:56,747
You better. You know
the paperwork involved.

31
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:59,499
We'll say they landed
on your side. Okay?

32
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,667
No problemo.

33
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:01,835
<i>Comandante!</i>

34
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,111
Load these guys in our car

35
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:29,488
The bags too

36
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,031
And put this shit out!

37
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,954
We might have to
book them ourselves.

38
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,374
Bullshit. These are
our prisoners, Vazquez.

39
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,920
Not the way I see it, Bill.
They are on Mexican soil.

40
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:46,880
You're a piece
of shit, Vazquez.

41
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,465
There's no way you're
taking these clowns.

42
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,342
You're in no position
to bargain.

43
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:52,219
I'd hate for our
little arrangement,

44
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,845
every second Tuesday
of the month...

45
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,555
Fuck you, Vazquez!

46
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:57,557
You thinking about blowing the
whistle on me or something, huh?

47
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,518
Yeah, if I need to.

48
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,685
Is that a threat, cabrén?

49
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:04,231
Look, you're corrupt,
we're corrupt.

50
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,149
There's one difference.

51
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,484
We're honest about it.

52
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:13,907
You better bury them
in that goddamn

53
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:17,118
"I don't give a fuck, slap on the
wrist" beaner system of yours.

54
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,248
You win, Bill.

55
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,542
You won't be hearing
from them again.

56
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:26,586
Hey, what did they do?

57
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,130
Rob a bank?

58
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,263
You figure it out, genius.

59
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,432
Let's go.

60
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,318
Luis, let's get
the fuck out of here!

61
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:51,653
It's procedure!

62
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,738
Fuck procedure, let's go!

63
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,880
No IDS

64
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,634
What's your name?

65
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:16,219
I'm Bozo,
he's Frosty with the...

66
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,015
What's your name?
Howard.

67
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,101
Dennis?

68
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,312
Fuck! Ruben?

69
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:28,940
This guy's dead!

70
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,819
Don't worry. We'll give
him a nice burial,

71
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:34,821
relieve you of
your money troubles,

72
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,907
and find you a nice place.

73
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:39,075
You'll be happy there.

74
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,124
<i>Ah, prison.</i>

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,836
<i>I lucked out. It could've</i>
<i>been a hole in the desert.</i>

76
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,174
<i>And since I didn't</i>
<i>have any cash,</i>

77
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:57,177
<i>I guess they were</i>
<i>forced to charge me.</i>

78
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,388
<i>God only knew</i>
<i>where my cash was.</i>

79
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:03,058
<i>But at least</i>
<i>I know who had it.</i>

80
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:18,073
<i>That's been playing</i>
<i>for six fucking hours.</i>

81
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,409
<i>Torture by Mariachi.</i>

82
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:26,331
<i>Ah, what's this?</i>

83
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,083
Check your guns,
you know the rules

84
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,460
<i>Oh. Inmates. With guns.</i>

85
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:33,046
<i>Now that's kind of new.</i>

86
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,798
Take care of this one

87
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:37,884
<i>I got a lot to</i>
<i>learn about this place.</i>

88
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:47,894
Give me your shoes, bitch!

89
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:53,400
Dancing with the Stars.

90
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:55,276
<i>I see</i>

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,904
<i>Get your mind right. Soften</i>
<i>you up in a holding cell</i>

92
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,740
<i>with loud music,</i>
<i>deprive you of sleep.</i>

93
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:04,911
<i>Oh, well, I guess I was gonna have</i>
<i>to take my lumps sooner or later.</i>

94
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,416
<i>Zapatos!</i>
<i>H U h?</i>

95
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:13,128
Yeah?
<i>The shoes, puto!</i>

96
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:15,338
Ah...

97
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,924
You look like
you have really small feet

98
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:19,718
and these are size 11!

99
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,190
<i>Ah. Fucking ouch.</i>

100
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:37,694
You'll have fun
in here asshole

101
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:24,074
This will be
your home for a while

102
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,409
and we your family

103
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:28,661
In a few hours

104
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:31,664
you will be moved
into the main prison

105
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,918
You'll have some freedom

106
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,129
but remember...

107
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:40,340
this is still a prison

108
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,843
Use what you've learned
in this holding cell

109
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,679
and don't make trouble

110
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:49,015
for us or yourselves

111
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,101
Or, as the saying goes...

112
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,228
small town...

113
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,646
large hell

114
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:57,023
Welcome

115
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:00,610
This is "El Pueblito"

116
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:05,365
God bless you

117
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,716
Jack, you work too hard.

118
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,260
The Consulate's closed.

119
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:27,971
I just came to
pick up the files.

120
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,890
I think you may be forgetting
to report an American citizen.

121
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:33,476
That's a serious
offense, Armando.

122
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,562
Honest mistake, Jack.

123
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:38,064
Come see me tomorrow.
We'll sort it out.

124
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:43,778
<i>Five thousand songs</i>
<i>or so later,</i>

125
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:45,738
G-24 - G-25 - G-26 - G-27

126
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,865

129
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,187
<i>Now I've been</i>
<i>in the joint before,</i>

130
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,856
<i>but this was</i>
<i>kind of different.</i>

131
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:38,750
<i>Is this a prison or the</i>
<i>world's shittiest mall?</i>

132
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,167
<i>If I was going to</i>
<i>survive in this place,</i>

133
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,293
<i>it was time to do</i>
<i>what I was good at.</i>

134
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:23,336
What's up, old man?

135
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,509
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>I was out of cigarettes.</i>

136
00:13:13,553 --> 00:13:15,054
<i>Holy Rolex.</i>

137
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,101
<i>Shit.</i>

138
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,002
<i>Gracias.</i>

139
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:51,090
<i>Well, it was</i>
<i>bedtime at El Pueblito.</i>

140
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:55,094
<i>Hmm. Looked like all the good</i>
<i>pieces of dirt were taken.</i>

141
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:07,607
Get up you lazy bums!

142
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:11,444
Move it, move it!

143
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,989
You can talk later,
let's move it!

144
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:17,784
Move it!

145
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,707
You too gringo,
get the fuck over there!

146
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:27,835
Let's go, let's go

147
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:38,596
Plastics

148
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:43,059
<i>You know, you gotta</i>
<i>love murderers</i>

149
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:45,311
<i>who recycle.</i>

150
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:12,672
Heads up gringo,
here they come!

151
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,406
This is going
to pinch a little.

152
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:39,699
Cunt.

153
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:51,919
Lunch!

154
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:07,685
<i>Somebody was running this</i>

<i>Ah. Now he looks like somebody.</i>
<i>People showing him respect.</i>

156
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,069
<i>Yeah, he's somebody.</i>
<i>He's yelling at people.</i>

157
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:27,079
<i>So the little guy in the bad-taste</i>
<i>clothes is working for him</i>

158
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:29,248
<i>'cause he's making</i>
<i>his life miserable.</i>

159
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:32,376
<i>And... Wait a minute,</i>
<i>12 o'clock.</i>

160
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:35,463
<i>Guy in a bathrobe</i>
<i>in the penthouse.</i>

161
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:39,467
<i>Well, he must be El Hefner.</i>

162
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,513
<i>No, no. Those two guys are</i>
<i>both working for him.</i>

163
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,306
<i>He doesn't even</i>
<i>have to get dressed</i>

164
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,517
<i>and he's making both</i>
<i>their lives miserable.</i>

165
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,770
<i>Where'd he get</i>
<i>a bathrobe like that?</i>

166
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,940
<i>I had to improve my social</i>
<i>standing around here.</i>

167
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,775
<i>It was simple, really.</i>

168
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,485
<i>Two bits bought you</i>
<i>a day off work</i>

169
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:00,530
<i>so you could focus</i>
<i>on doing a real job.</i>

170
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:06,702
<i>Need some heroin?</i>

171
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,955
<i>Make tracks to</i>

172
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:11,415
<i>where business</i>

173
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,609
Got a cigarette?

174
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:06,405
Yeah.
Can I have one?

175
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:08,866
How old are you, kid?

176
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:10,368
Eighteen.
Get lost.

177
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:11,952
I'm ten. Can I have one now?

178
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:13,454
No.

179
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:20,378
You probably want me
to keep my mouth shut.

180
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:27,468
Well, Manuel's taco
stand caught on fire,

181
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:30,638
and Rodrigo the Doctor seems
to have some misplaced cash.

182
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:33,265
If I talk, the shit's really
going to hit the fence.

183
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:35,101
Cigarette?

184
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,104
Light?

185
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,276
So, you're a watcher.

186
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:45,569
You learn a lot
from watching.

187
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,614
What are you in here for?

188
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:50,241
Very funny.

189
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:53,619
I'm only ten, man.
My father was a dealer.

190
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:54,787
Was?

191
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,957
Yeah, I live here
with my mom.

192
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,251
You speak pretty good English, kid.
Where'd you learn?

193
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,711
<i>Sesame Street.</i>

194
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:06,674
What's with all the school kids
going back and forth all the time?

195
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,718
If you're not an inmate,
you're free to go in and out.

196
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,428
What? They live here?
Yeah.

197
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,512
Hmm.

198
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,305
If you have money,
you can pay for your family

199
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,224
to come live with you
while you're serving time.

200
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:18,144
That's a new one. How come
you don't go to school?

201
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:19,478
I'm special.
Yeah?

202
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,813
How are you special?

203
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:24,024
I just lit it for him!

204
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,109
Let's go

205
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,865
What did I tell you about
the fucking cigarettes!

206
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:32,992
Most gringos
are in worse shape

207
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,744
after a few days
in El Pueblito.

208
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:37,329
Yeah. Some vacation, huh?

209
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,582
I bet you'd like
one of these.

210
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:41,167
Oh, would I!

211
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,418
Oh, yeah!

212
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:49,467
Now, your, uh, file doesn't have a name.
Do you have a name?

213
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:51,343
Yes. Richard Johnson.

214
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:54,638
Dick Johnson, huh?

215
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:56,015
It's unfortunate.

216
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:57,683
Yeah.

217
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:00,853
Anybody I can contact
for you, Dick?

218
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,438
Wife, sweetheart?
No.

219
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,190
Boyfriend?
No.

220
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:05,858
I didn't think SO.

221
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,736
Says here you were
caught buying Valium

222
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,405
in a drugstore downtown
without a prescription.

223
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,073
That doesn't quite fit.

224
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:14,742
What are you doing in here?

225
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:16,744
You're right. It doesn't fit.
That is bullshit.

226
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:17,870
They're making this up.

227
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,705
Two cops got a hold of me,

228
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,875
they rolled me in and I ended up in here.
You gotta get me out of here.

229
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,043
Just misunderstood, huh?

230
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,503
Yes, that's right.

231
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:29,465
You don't have
any fingerprints.

232
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:35,554
Guy who burns off his
fingerprints is a career man.

233
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:36,722
Even I know that much.

234
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:40,184
You gonna get me
out of here or not?

235
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:42,728
Seems to me somebody's
trying to bury you in here.

236
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,021
No shit, Sherlock.

237
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:51,320
What do you want?

238
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:53,030
I mean,
maybe I can help you.

239
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,657
Like I said,

240
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,450
I can't help you
without any information.

241
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:57,910
You're not giving me
any information.

242
00:21:57,993 --> 00:21:59,495
You spring me out of here,
I'll give you plenty.

243
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,667
You know,
it's a lot easier to

244
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,627
end up dead in here
than to survive.

245
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,088
Gringo without money in a
south of the border jail.

246
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:11,090
Ah, it's not so bad,
you know.

247
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:12,967
At least it's a shithole.

248
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,804
All right.
You're not gonna tell me.

249
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,347
That's all right. That's
all right, that's fine.

250
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,598
I can respect that.

251
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,935
But I will find the truth
out for myself, you know.

252
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:26,230
Well, even a blind pig has to
find an acorn now and then.

253
00:22:28,524 --> 00:22:30,192
You called me fat.

254
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:32,486
Be careful, my friend.
You'll hurt my feelings.

255
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,196
Let me tell you something.

256
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:37,074
There's a little
skinny guy inside of me

257
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,701
and you know what
that guy's saying?

258
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:40,953
He's saying
something stinks about you.

259
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:43,122
And I'm gonna
find out what it is.

260
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,042
Nice meeting you.

261
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:48,419
You too.
Thanks for dropping by.

262
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,962
Take care of yourself.

263
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:51,297
Yeah, don't sweat too much.

264
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:52,590
Oh, I never do!

265
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:54,133
<i>The ugly American.</i>

266
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:55,926
<i>I thought it was me</i>
<i>until he turned up.</i>

267
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,845
<i>I didn't like him</i>
<i>sniffing around my business.</i>

268
00:22:58,971 --> 00:22:59,972
Nothing's free!

269
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:02,224
Please! We have
nowhere to go!

270
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:04,810
You could stay with me

271
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:07,271
You won't let me help you

272
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,982
C'mon kids,
hurry up, let's go

273
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:19,575
Hey, you speak English?

274
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:21,827
Yeah.

275
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm looking
for a place to live

276
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:25,122
and you look like
the guy that knows.

277
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:28,334
Real estate is
a high commodity.

278
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,877
What are you looking for?

279
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,003
Nothing special.

280
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:32,087
Here we are!

281
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,172
Get out, cabrén!

282
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,676
Nothing special. There is a common
bathroom for tenants outside.

283
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:39,803
TV and cable are
additional if you want it.

284
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:43,182
Fan, blanket, and towel
are complimentary. Welcome.

285
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,352
Perfect.

286
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,446
All good General?

287
00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:41,824
Take care of him

288
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:06,724
<i>Well, this must be</i>
<i>cell block A.</i>

289
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:09,893
<i>Gives a whole new meaning</i>
<i>to doing hard time.</i>

290
00:25:09,935 --> 00:25:11,854
<i>A special wing</i>
<i>for special inmates.</i>

291
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,608
<i>I guess you had to</i>
<i>know someone to get in.</i>

292
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:11,663
What the fuck
are you looking at?

293
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:15,125
Fuck!

294
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:23,425
Why aren't you in bed?

295
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:25,135
I didn't want you
walking home alone

296
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:40,359
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>So escaping is frowned upon.</i>

297
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,448
It's harder
than it looks, guero.

298
00:26:47,116 --> 00:26:48,283
Breaking out.

299
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:50,577
I don't know.
It looks pretty easy to me.

300
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:53,080
You can buy anything
in El Pueblito.

301
00:26:53,163 --> 00:26:54,206
Except your way out.

302
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:56,625
Even Javi has to come back
when he goes out.

303
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,751
Who's Javi?

304
00:26:58,919 --> 00:26:59,962
King Rat

305
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:01,130
He runs the joint.

306
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:02,965
Lives up there,
where the rich people live.

307
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:05,634
Oh, the guy with the cheesy
bathrobe and the cell phone.

308
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:06,718
Yeah. Cigarette?

309
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,011
No. What do you mean,
"When he goes out"?

310
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:11,473
<i>A veces sale. Dinner,</i>
soccer matches, whatever.

311
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:13,058
But even he has to come back.

312
00:27:13,142 --> 00:27:15,394
Wow, he's really got a good
thing going for him in here.

313
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:16,562
Oh, yeah.

314
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:18,856
Hmm?

315
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,649
I'm gonna kill him.

316
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:22,484
Okay. Why?
What did he ever do to you?

317
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:23,569
It's personal.

318
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,445
Remind me never
to rub you the wrong way.

319
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:26,947
Cigarette?
No, kid.

320
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,365
You mother has
a vicious right.

321
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,701
She's asleep.
She worked late last night.

322
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:32,244
Yeah, I know.
What's she do?

323
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,328
Shit for Javi.

324
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,414
Last night was casino night.

325
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,709
Hey, who are
those two guys?

326
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,127
Ren and Stimpy?
Yeah.

327
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,588
The big guy, Caracas,
that's Javi's brother.

328
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,131
What about the little
real estate cat?

329
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:45,883
Carnal. He's their cousin.

330
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:48,385
He's a useless prick.
Even they hate him.

331
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:50,762
Cigarette?

332
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:52,764
No.

333
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:55,601
When I came in here,
they took blood from me.

334
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:57,102
I'm figuring
it's not a health thing.

335
00:27:57,186 --> 00:27:58,437
No shit

336
00:27:58,478 --> 00:27:59,771
Can I have a cigarette,
for fuck's sake?

337
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:01,940
You know, the other day
you told me you were special.

338
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,234
How are you special?

339
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:06,278
How are you special?
Fuck you!

340
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:09,156
You're so special, get your
own fucking cigarettes.

341
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:12,075
Quit mooching off me. I got
a 40 year habit. Get lost.

342
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,744
Whoo!

343
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:21,436
<i>Ah, Sunday.</i>

344
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,897
<i>Visiting day at El Pueblito.</i>

345
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:27,693
<i>Bring the whole family to the</i>
<i>crappiest place on earth.</i>

346
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:32,531
<i>Enjoy our ever-popular,</i>
<i>world famous cavity search.</i>

347
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:39,162
<i>At 20 bucks a pop,</i>
<i>they were making a killing.</i>

348
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:48,297
30 pesos for fifteen minutes

349
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,631
Go play kids!

350
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:08,900
One.

351
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:14,323
Calm down,
there's enough for everyone

352
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:34,092
That's the kid,
give him a hand!

353
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:39,097
What's wrong with you?

354
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:40,724
Tough guy, eh?

355
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:42,517
Shut the fuck up!

356
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:45,228
Touch him again
and I'll cut your balls off

357
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,271
Now fuck off!

358
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:49,608
You good?

359
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,343
Hey, kid, that's more than
a toothpick you got there.

360
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:17,594
What's your plan?

361
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:18,804
Stab him in the heart.

362
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:20,013
Oh.

363
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:21,723
The aorta, the vena cava.

364
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:24,684
Those are pretty deep blood vessels.
Chances are you'd miss.

365
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:28,563
How about the stomach?

366
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:30,816
Real grab bag.
Full of guts, liver, spleen.

367
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,318
Hmm. Quick treatment would
probably save his life.

368
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:35,654
The neck?
Yeah, good thinking.

369
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:37,114
The carotid.

370
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:38,865
Too high for you, kid.
You'd need a ladder.

371
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,451
Typically, you want to kill
someone instantaneously,

372
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:43,703
you go for the central
nervous system or the brain.

373
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,163
Lights out.

374
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:46,456
Fuck!

375
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:55,882
Have a smoke?
I really need one.

376
00:32:00,846 --> 00:32:02,139
No.

377
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,560
Not until you tell me why
you're so special around here.

378
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:07,686
Fuck you,
you can't touch me!

379
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:09,521
What, if I do this
those guys are gonna kill me?

380
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:11,064
You're holding out on me, kid.
Spit it out!

381
00:32:11,148 --> 00:32:12,232
<i>Fuck you, puto!</i>

382
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:13,316
Knock it off.

383
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:14,734
Is that guy Javi
your father?

384
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:16,194
Is that why they
protect you, huh?

385
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:20,740
You're a mosquito!
Sit the fuck down!

386
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:27,372
A man who won't
level with you,

387
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:28,665
that's a man
you can't trust.

388
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,544
You don't ever talk to me again.
Get lost, kid.

389
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:40,093
He killed my father!

390
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:51,771
I was seven when
I came to live here.

391
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:55,859
My parents were doing 15,
drug trafficking.

392
00:32:57,569 --> 00:32:59,112
Javi needed a new liver.

393
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:03,200
And my dad
was a perfect match.

394
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:05,035
Same rare blood type.

395
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,204
He has my father's liver.

396
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:08,788
I want to cut it out of him,

397
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,415
and bury it with my dad.

398
00:33:13,043 --> 00:33:14,503
Okay.

399
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,255
But what's
the deal with you?

400
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:19,424
He's going to need
another liver.

401
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:23,762
Fuck. Well, I guess
you are special.

402
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:25,722
That's why
they took my blood.

403
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:27,390
Bingo gringo!

404
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:29,017
They test everyone,

405
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,685
but I'm the only match.

406
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,693
I got put
on the inside at 14

407
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:41,112
for trying to fuck up
somebody I really hated.

408
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,614
My dad.

409
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:45,742
I wish someone had killed
him, I'd given him a cigar.

410
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:48,662
He'd been beating up on my mom.
The third time that week

411
00:33:48,745 --> 00:33:51,998
I snapped finally and went to
work on him with a baseball bat.

412
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,670
The only mistake I made,
I didn't kill him.

413
00:33:56,753 --> 00:34:00,006
That's why I ended up in the
shitter the first time.

414
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,341
So you gotta
be careful, kid.

415
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:03,301
If you're gonna do
this thing, do it right.

416
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,886
Otherwise they'll
fry your balls off.

417
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,846
And although you're not
using them at the moment,

418
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,475
trust me, someday soon, you're
gonna want those puppies working.

419
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:13,353
You don't wanna kill Javi.

420
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:16,022
You need to kill Javi.

421
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:17,649
Before he kills you.

422
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,151
Here, look at this.

423
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:24,072
I was a sniper.

424
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:26,825
Snipers work
in two-man teams.

425
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:28,493
I need a spotter.
You up for the gig?

426
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,537
Are we going to shoot him?

427
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:33,707
It's not about that.
It's about watching.

428
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,169
Waiting. We'll see him,
we'll get him.

429
00:34:39,004 --> 00:34:42,007
Yeah. Fucker's lived
too long.

430
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:45,343
What do you mean why?

431
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,970
He's stealing from us,
and he's an idiot

432
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:48,847
Carnal is family

433
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:50,223
He's a liability

434
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:53,101
You straighten him out,
I don't want to deal with it

435
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,061
You may not have a choice

436
00:34:55,312 --> 00:34:56,313
He's getting out of hand

437
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:57,939
People hate him

438
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,025
What do you
want me to do...

439
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:01,860
kill him?

440
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:04,195
Just get him off real estate

441
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:06,114
It's a big job,
too much money

442
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:07,532
Give him an assistant

443
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:10,785
Deal with it brother

444
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:12,037
Hey, come here.

445
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,538
Mom's here, she's cooking

446
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:15,915
What'd you find out?

447
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:19,836
Mom!

448
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:20,962
A sight for sore eyes

449
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:22,255
Aunt Flor

450
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,049
And your cousin?

451
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,216
He's coming

452
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:31,640
How's his health?

453
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:33,516
Is he drinking?

454
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:34,559
Don't worry so much

455
00:35:34,643 --> 00:35:35,644
I'm holding you responsible

456
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:49,282
Hey, fellas!

457
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,743
Who the fuck are you?

458
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:54,954
I'm with the US Consulate
in Tijuana.

459
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,581
Really.

460
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:57,999
You a cop?

461
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,584
No.

462
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:01,252
Couldn't pass the physical.

463
00:36:01,836 --> 00:36:03,171
So what do you want?

464
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:05,590
No. What do you want?

465
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:08,718
The man who drove this car or the
guys who were spending the money?

466
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:11,429
Both.

467
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:13,765
One stop shop.
Welcome to Costco.

468
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:17,435
Yeah. Here's my
membership card.

469
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,188
Oh, come on.
Take it easy, cowboy.

470
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:23,191
All I want is the joy
of seeing justice done.

471
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:25,193
It'll be for the right price,
I'm not greedy.

472
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:27,737
Hell, I'll get you a picture.

473
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:30,573
I'll take you
to him personally. Huh?

474
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:32,534
How do you like them apples?

475
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:38,123
Let me remind you...

476
00:36:38,415 --> 00:36:40,291
that all the money raised...

477
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:43,169
will go to the family fund
here at El Pueblito

478
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:44,713
So cough it up!

479
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:47,841
Straight from Juarez...

480
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:50,093
the King of the Skies...

481
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:51,136
Magno!

482
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:54,597
That's Magno.
He's running in fourth.

483
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:57,434
And there's no way he can beat Blue Demon Jr.
He's a champion.

484
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,811
And the legendary...
Blue Demon Jr.

485
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:03,940
The referee...

486
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:05,150
our dear friend

487
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,193
Mr. Ringo Starr

488
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:10,822
Him and Sanso
are like the best.

489
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:14,200
They're like the shit, man.

490
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:18,246
Before my dad got locked away
we went to go see his match.

491
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,835
Blue! Blue! Blue!

492
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:28,923
Hey, you gotta... You gotta
knock this shit off, kid.

493
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,675
Come on.
Get yourself another habit.

494
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:33,052
Sugar. Here.

495
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:35,597
Get yourself an ice cream.

496
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:38,349
Orale. Thanks.
Bring me back the change.

497
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:43,062
Behave Mom!

498
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,983
HEY
HEY

499
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:52,363
Why the money?

500
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:54,199
Ah, you know,
he worries too much.

501
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:55,700
He needs to be
a kid for a while.

502
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:56,951
Why, you gonna hit me again?

503
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:59,871
He does
worry too much.

504
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:01,372
Today he looks happy.

505
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:04,292
He talks about you.
Told me about your dad.

506
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,420
And how you talked him out
of something stupid.

507
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:09,714
That's not easy.

508
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:11,549
Well, he's smart.
He listens.

509
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:13,218
He doesn't talk
to many people.

510
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:14,344
No?

511
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:18,014
Want a beer?

512
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:22,977
Yeah.

513
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,314
You got a visitor!

514
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,066
Oh, I have a visitor.
I'm sorry.

515
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:29,400
Mmm-hmm.

516
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,444
I'll take you up on the beer later.
Thank you.

517
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,576
Right.

518
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:43,915
Well, howdy, buckeroos!

519
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,501
Looking sharp!

520
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:51,881
Thank you for your financial
contribution to our families.

521
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:53,091
Don't mention it.

522
00:38:54,425 --> 00:38:55,802
We took care of Frosty,
by the way.

523
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,641
He did want a cremation,
didn't he?

524
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:03,101
Oh, I didn’t
know him that well.

525
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:05,603
We have a serious problem.

526
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:08,773
Is this something
I can help you with?

527
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:11,192
Well, the thing is, two of
the cops that were with us

528
00:39:11,276 --> 00:39:13,361
when we first met,
turned up dead.

529
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:17,031
Cops die all the time,
it's part of the trade.

530
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:20,285
What is disturbing is the
fact they were tortured.

531
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,203
Badly.

532
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:24,789
So we wanted to ask you
where you got the money.

533
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:28,668
We are just concerned that
someone might be looking for it.

534
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,962
And if they are,
we need to know who it is.

535
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:33,256
I see. Two million bucks
is a lot of money.

536
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:36,384
Two million dollars is a lot
of money, you're right.

537
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:40,763
Well, it says here they were
found in a brand new Mercedes.

538
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:42,682
What... What model was it?

539
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:49,647
Listen, things can get
a lot worse for you in here.

540
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:52,066
Oh, let me guess, you've
got friends in here, too.

541
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,486
Well, I'm sure Javi's power
stretches outside these walls.

542
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:57,488
I mean, he knows about the
money you stole from me, yeah?

543
00:39:57,572 --> 00:39:59,073
I mean, you gave him
his cut, right?

544
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:00,909
Listen, you fucking gringo!

545
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:02,911
You may think you have
this place figured out,

546
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:04,537
but you don't know shit!

547
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:05,997
Just tell us where
you got the money.

548
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:07,790
I'll tell you what,

549
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:10,960
whoever tortured those cops
surely knows you're in here.

550
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:12,670
If you tell us,
we could help.

551
00:40:12,962 --> 00:40:15,590
Otherwise, it's just a matter of
time before they come get you.

552
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:19,469
No, you're right.

553
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,263
And here's the thing, and I'm
sure you two will agree with me,

554
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,265
they'll be coming
to get you two first.

555
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:27,852
So here's my advice, stop
spending my fucking money.

556
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:31,272
Put it someplace safe and then
go and hide yourselves. Okay?

557
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:34,317
Because when they find you,
they will kill you.

558
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:36,319
And then I'll never
get my damn money!

559
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:38,947
Suit yourself. And watch
your back in here!

560
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,282
Yeah, take it easy
out there.

561
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:42,992
You have no idea who we are!

562
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:45,662
You're Vazquez.

563
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:47,705
Badge number 903489.

564
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:50,291
You're Romero. Badge number 1...
Oh, fuck it!

565
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:06,182
You ever been fishing?

566
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:07,392
Never been out
of this joint.

567
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:11,229
No? Well, you got a treat in
store, but it's kinda like this.

568
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:12,480
There he is.

569
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:15,858
You know what to do.
Divide and conquer.

570
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:25,743
That's my watch

571
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:26,995
Hey kid!

572
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:28,538
Where are you going?

573
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:29,580
Come here you prick

574
00:41:29,664 --> 00:41:30,665
What?

575
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:31,749
Come here you little fucker

576
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,084
Fucking Indian

577
00:41:33,126 --> 00:41:34,127
Damn!

578
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:46,681
Hey, cabrén!

579
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:48,391
Sorry. Sorry.

580
00:41:58,776 --> 00:41:59,819
Give me!

581
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:00,903
Where'd you get it?

582
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:02,030
I found it in the trash

583
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:03,614
It's mine

584
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:05,408
I'm going to tell Caracas

585
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:07,243
What are you looking at?

586
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:11,080
Bang, bang.

587
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:12,331
Come here.

588
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:14,000
Heart shot.

589
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,294
Yeah. Well, you spot,
I'll shoot. Come here.

590
00:42:16,753 --> 00:42:18,546
We did better than
I thought. Here.

591
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:20,465
There's your cut.
Oh, nice.

592
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:22,508
Oh. Here. And I got this
for you, too.

593
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,093
What is it?
Nicotine gum.

594
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:25,887
What does it do?
Yeah. Stops the craving.

595
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,930
Don't flash it around.
Don't spend it in big chunks,

596
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:30,349
that's how
you get boned, okay.

597
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:32,894
Hey, how about
that beer now?

598
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:34,812
Oh. Twist my arm?

599
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:36,439
Which one?
This one.

600
00:42:37,398 --> 00:42:38,649
Thank you.

601
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:41,069
I was a user.
That's how we met.

602
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:43,821
Then I helped him out,
cutting the shit.

603
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:45,448
Packing it...

604
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,241
We got busted
with three kilos.

605
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:48,743
Got 15 years.

606
00:42:48,826 --> 00:42:49,827
Thank you.

607
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:53,498
At least,
I got cleaned up in here.

608
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:57,168
You have a cigarette?

609
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:01,339
Yeah. You remind me
of someone.

610
00:43:01,547 --> 00:43:05,384
Yes. If you tell him,
I'll kick your ass.

611
00:43:05,468 --> 00:43:06,511
Again?

612
00:43:06,552 --> 00:43:07,553
Worse.

613
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:11,432
Where is he? Is he around?

614
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:13,976
I think he went for a beer.

615
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:15,144
What?

616
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,854
Oh, shut up.

617
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:21,526
So, guero, you married?

618
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:24,612
Easy, mamacita,
you're moving a little fast.

619
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,698
That's a very
sensitive subject for me.

620
00:43:29,158 --> 00:43:30,576
I was. Um...

621
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:33,371
She ran off with a former
business associate of mine,

622
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:34,872
one Reginald T. Barnes.

623
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:37,458
We were doing a job,
I got away...

624
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:39,544
He got caught.

625
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:41,087
He ratted me out
for immunity,

626
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,880
and I did seven years
in the slammer.

627
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:44,757
She ended up
shacking up with him.

628
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:46,425
Nice, huh?

629
00:43:47,343 --> 00:43:49,971
You know, I still have
recurring dreams about it.

630
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:52,056
Yeah, there's a knock
on the door.

631
00:43:52,098 --> 00:43:54,392
Reginald opens it,
he's wearing underpants

632
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,310
and eating a bowl
of cornflakes, weird, huh?

633
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:57,895
Mmm.
Yeah. Not a pretty sight.

634
00:43:57,979 --> 00:43:59,730
There's milk spilling
down his chin and shit.

635
00:43:59,814 --> 00:44:02,775
And my wife's making
coffee over behind him.

636
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:04,068
And these two goons
at the door,

637
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,403
whip out these
massive cannons...

638
00:44:05,486 --> 00:44:08,739
And they start
filling his chest full of holes,

639
00:44:08,823 --> 00:44:10,366
he hits the floor,
dead as a mackerel.

640
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:12,910
She drops the coffee and
starts screaming her ass off.

641
00:44:16,414 --> 00:44:17,540
And then?

642
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,459
Well, then I wake up.

643
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:25,631
The resentment
will kill us all.

644
00:44:25,715 --> 00:44:28,801
But them first. Here...
Here's to resentment.

645
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:46,110
I know you know
about the liver.

646
00:44:46,194 --> 00:44:47,528
Well...

647
00:44:48,362 --> 00:44:49,739
How rare can blood be?

648
00:44:50,531 --> 00:44:53,284
Very. It's called
Bombay Blood.

649
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:55,912
One in half a million.

650
00:44:56,412 --> 00:44:58,581
Javi found a match.

651
00:44:58,873 --> 00:44:59,916
Your husband.

652
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,001
And my son.

653
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:05,671
I never know when
they'll come for him.

654
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:07,548
Yeah, well...

655
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:10,843
We're not gonna
let that happen.

656
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,681
Are we?

657
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:45,002
What's up?

658
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:48,965
What do you want?

659
00:45:49,006 --> 00:45:50,007
The money

660
00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:53,010
You trade rent
payments for sex

661
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:54,887
Others pay you with drugs

662
00:45:54,971 --> 00:45:56,013
You're out of control

663
00:45:56,097 --> 00:45:57,723
You're a disgrace

664
00:45:58,307 --> 00:46:00,434
We never should have
given you this job

665
00:46:00,518 --> 00:46:02,311
Tough shit...
it's a family business

666
00:46:02,353 --> 00:46:03,980
Maybe you're the fuck up

667
00:46:04,355 --> 00:46:06,816
If I was in charge,
no one would steal from us

668
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:09,360
Enlighten me

669
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,028
I was robbed

670
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:12,446
BY Whom?

671
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,410
I don't know

672
00:46:18,577 --> 00:46:20,371
There are
a few thieves in here

673
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,582
You and your fucking lies

674
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:26,002
Don't bullshit me

675
00:46:26,877 --> 00:46:29,338
The money, or the fucker
who robbed you

676
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:31,590
You're my cousin...

677
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,677
but if you don't deliver,
you're finished

678
00:46:37,513 --> 00:46:38,806
Fuck off,
I'm not your bitch!

679
00:46:39,432 --> 00:46:41,142
The money, fucker

680
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:56,157
When did you get robbed?

681
00:46:56,574 --> 00:46:57,575
Who knows

682
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:00,077
When I got my watch back?

683
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:01,203
I don't know!

684
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:09,337
Maybe

685
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:20,931
Do you think I'm an idiot!?

686
00:47:27,104 --> 00:47:28,439
Where'd you get the watch!?

687
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:29,607
I found it!

688
00:47:31,233 --> 00:47:32,318
Did the gringo help?

689
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:33,486
No, it was just me!

690
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:34,570
Get him!

691
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:38,324
Caracas.

692
00:47:39,283 --> 00:47:41,118
Think you can fool me
you little fuck!?

693
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:41,429
Get off her,
you son of a bitch!

694
00:48:52,523 --> 00:48:53,983
I'm not done with you!

695
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:15,463
What did you idiots do!?

696
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:19,216
This room was built for me!

697
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:21,093
Now you're bleeding
all over it

698
00:49:21,177 --> 00:49:22,470
He had the mom...

699
00:49:23,804 --> 00:49:25,055
He was going to kill the kid

700
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:27,558
Son of a bitch!

701
00:49:28,893 --> 00:49:29,935
What the fuck did you do?

702
00:49:30,895 --> 00:49:32,146
Idiot!

703
00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:33,230
Answer me!

704
00:49:33,272 --> 00:49:34,690
Now what?

705
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:35,733
Javi!

706
00:49:43,908 --> 00:49:45,034
It's Aunt Flor

707
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:46,785
Answer it

708
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:49,788
Answer it, man!

709
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:53,292
Hi, Aunt

710
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:57,254
He can't talk right now...

711
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:00,508
he's lying down

712
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:05,429
Okay, We

713
00:50:07,014 --> 00:50:08,015
It's going to
break her heart

714
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:09,099
What could I say?

715
00:50:10,017 --> 00:50:12,144
If the gringo hadn't
killed him, I would have

716
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:13,812
What about the gringo?

717
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:15,231
What about him?

718
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:16,982
He's not family,
he's not Mexican...

719
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:19,693
I'd kill him

720
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:29,078
I saved your
brother's life.

721
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,455
I saved your life, too. I
protected the kid and the liver.

722
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:33,040
I terminated two
troublesome employees.

723
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,167
Fucking gringo!

724
00:50:35,251 --> 00:50:36,335
One of those was my cousin!

725
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,712
Don't tell me you weren't thinking
about killing him already.

726
00:50:38,796 --> 00:50:39,838
I saved you
the embarrassment

727
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:41,298
of having family blood
on your hands.

728
00:50:41,382 --> 00:50:43,008
And if he was willing
to kill your brother,

729
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:44,385
he was coming
to kill you next.

730
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:46,178
In about a minute and a
half, to be precise.

731
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:47,555
So, I saved your
fucking life twice.

732
00:50:51,642 --> 00:50:52,768
I need a drink

733
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,229
Fuck!

734
00:50:56,814 --> 00:50:57,815
Fuck!

735
00:50:57,898 --> 00:50:58,899
Cut him loose!

736
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,277
Yeah, okay.
Give me a minute.

737
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:03,445
I need to change my shorts,
for God's sake!

738
00:51:07,658 --> 00:51:08,701
He knows about my liver

739
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:12,121
He knew about
our problems with Carnal

740
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,624
He seems to know
what I'm thinking

741
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:18,544
Who is he?

742
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:19,628
I don't know

743
00:51:20,004 --> 00:51:21,088
Armando doesn't know either

744
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:24,800
So he's in here with no name,
charges, or fingerprints?

745
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:27,761
You're in charge
of security!

746
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:30,055
How does this fucking gringo
know everything?

747
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:31,140
So kill him then

748
00:51:31,223 --> 00:51:32,224
You idiot!

749
00:51:33,684 --> 00:51:35,644
Don't be hasty!

750
00:51:36,604 --> 00:51:38,188
First, find out who sent him

751
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:39,857
Find out who he is

752
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:42,526
Then we kill him

753
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,325
Which one?

754
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:51,452
Number three

755
00:51:54,913 --> 00:51:55,914
Yup.

756
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,374
<i>Hey, there.</i>

757
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,959
Oh, hey, Butterballs.

758
00:51:59,418 --> 00:52:01,045
Yeah, Butterballs.

759
00:52:01,086 --> 00:52:02,796
Just checking in. Wanted
to see how you're doing.

760
00:52:04,506 --> 00:52:05,883
<i>Fine.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

761
00:52:07,384 --> 00:52:10,971
<i>Well, you know, I see you're</i>
<i>still hanging in there.</i>

762
00:52:11,055 --> 00:52:12,264
So...

763
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:18,228
<i>I know there's money.</i>
<i>I could still help you out.</i>

764
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:21,565
All I want is
a piece of the pie.

765
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:24,652
<i>Talkative as ever, eh?</i>

766
00:52:24,777 --> 00:52:27,071
That's okay.
It was nice knowing you.

767
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:29,907
Sorry if we got off
on the wrong foot.

768
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:32,493
Good luck then.
You're gonna need it.

769
00:52:32,576 --> 00:52:36,246
<i>Butterballs was putting the</i>
<i>squeeze on me sooner than I thought.</i>

770
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:39,291
<i>It was time to play a card</i>
<i>I'd been holding back.</i>

771
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,835
<i>Try and get my cash</i>
<i>a little closer.</i>

772
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:42,920
<i>Buen dias.</i>

773
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,714
What do you want, guero?

774
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:48,217
I have some
information for you

775
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:49,718
that I think you
might find valuable.

776
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,930
Uh, two cops,
Vazquez and Romero,

777
00:52:53,013 --> 00:52:55,265
badge number 90348...

778
00:52:55,307 --> 00:52:57,643
Okay, okay, okay.
We know our cops.

779
00:52:57,726 --> 00:52:58,936
Oh, you know them?
Mmm.

780
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:02,022
Well, in that case you'll
find this really interesting.

781
00:53:02,106 --> 00:53:04,483
They took a sizeable
amount of money

782
00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:05,609
from me when they
brought me here.

783
00:53:05,693 --> 00:53:07,653
And I figure I'll never
see the money again

784
00:53:07,736 --> 00:53:09,488
and I just wondered
if they gave you your cut.

785
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:12,408
Why? What's in it for you?

786
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:16,704
Mmm. Nothing now. Probably
since I told you, but...

787
00:53:16,787 --> 00:53:18,706
Look, I think a finder's fee
would be fair.

788
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,958
How much?
Oh, I don't need much.

789
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:23,210
Ten percent, maybe.
Okay, eight.

790
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,796
Uh-uh. How much money?

791
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:27,089
Oh.

792
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:30,509
You know, I only stole it. I
didn't have time to count it.

793
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:34,722
Uh, but ballpark, two
million, maybe a little more.

794
00:53:35,764 --> 00:53:39,226
You know what will happen
if you are pushing my leg?

795
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:42,604
Si. I know.
I wouldn't push your leg.

796
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:47,985
See you later.

797
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:52,448
Get Vazquez and Romero

798
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:57,035
And bring the money too

799
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:13,677
Yep, I rechecked it.
One million seven.

800
00:54:20,058 --> 00:54:21,310
Where the fuck's the rest?

801
00:54:21,852 --> 00:54:24,021
I swear on God.
That's all there was.

802
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:25,355
That's bullshit.
No bullshit.

803
00:54:25,397 --> 00:54:26,482
It is true.

804
00:54:27,858 --> 00:54:29,693
<i>Hello. Can you see me?</i>

805
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:32,696
Uh, yeah, boss.I can.

806
00:54:32,738 --> 00:54:34,990
<i>Okay, good. Is it all there?</i>

807
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:38,911
No, there's only 1.7 and a
couple of new cars out front.

808
00:54:39,203 --> 00:54:40,412
<i>Where's the rest?</i>

809
00:54:40,496 --> 00:54:43,540
It's all there.
Except for what we spent.

810
00:54:43,582 --> 00:54:45,709
The cars, some hookers.

811
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:47,628
We bought them shoes.

812
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:48,879
And tacos. That's all.

813
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:52,299
<i>Amigos, where is</i>
<i>the rest of my money?</i>

814
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:53,884
That's all there was.

815
00:54:53,926 --> 00:54:55,719
Talk to the gringo
that stole it.

816
00:54:57,596 --> 00:54:58,931
<i>Cut the toe off.</i>

817
00:54:59,014 --> 00:55:01,683
Well, we already did that, boss.
Two of them.

818
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:03,060
<i>Cut another one off.</i>

819
00:55:03,101 --> 00:55:06,021
No, please! I swear,
that's all there was!

820
00:55:06,104 --> 00:55:07,606
No!

821
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:20,202
<i>Hey, Mr. Vazquez.</i>
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

822
00:55:20,285 --> 00:55:23,413
<i>You see, I'm missing</i>
<i>four million dollars.</i>

823
00:55:23,455 --> 00:55:26,333
<i>You're missing</i>
<i>three toes so far.</i>

824
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:28,585
<i>I'll give you a moment</i>
<i>to do the arithmetic,</i>

825
00:55:28,669 --> 00:55:30,379
<i>then it's up to you</i>
<i>if you wanna talk.</i>

826
00:55:32,714 --> 00:55:34,091
<i>What did he say?</i>

827
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:36,927
He said, "What does
arithmetics mean?"

828
00:55:48,897 --> 00:55:51,191
<i>Oh, fuck it. Just kill 'em.</i>

829
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:53,819
No! Hey, hey! No!

830
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:57,990
Hey! Hey, no! I swear!

831
00:55:58,073 --> 00:55:59,157
No, please!

832
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:00,492
There was only two.

833
00:56:00,576 --> 00:56:02,119
Last chance, Vazquez!

834
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,453
No! No!

835
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:07,499
I swear! I swear!
Sure?

836
00:56:11,962 --> 00:56:13,255
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

837
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:16,341
<i>Hey! That's my money!</i>

838
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:18,969
That's Javi's share!

839
00:56:19,011 --> 00:56:20,012
<i>Javi?</i>

840
00:56:20,095 --> 00:56:21,179
I was going to
give Javi his cut!

841
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:22,264
<i>Javi Huerta?</i>

842
00:56:22,306 --> 00:56:23,307
You keep it!

843
00:56:26,143 --> 00:56:27,477
<i>Hey, hey-'</i>

844
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:31,231
<i>Javi. Motherfucker.</i>

845
00:56:31,315 --> 00:56:32,524
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you.</i>

846
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:35,110
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

847
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,487
I'm gonna kill you, Javi.

848
00:56:38,113 --> 00:56:40,240
With my own fucking hands.

849
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:46,914
Leave them there

850
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:53,170
I told you the gringo
would be trouble

851
00:56:53,587 --> 00:56:56,465
He stole big time
from Frank in San Diego

852
00:56:57,007 --> 00:56:59,217
Frank knows we have his money

853
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:05,515
You need to slow down

854
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:09,102
My big brother...

855
00:57:10,604 --> 00:57:12,522
always worried about me

856
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:14,524
You keep drinking
and smoking like this...

857
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:16,401
and the kid's liver
may not be enough

858
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:20,030
Go get the gringo

859
00:57:36,505 --> 00:57:38,048
You Buffet?
You got it.

860
00:57:44,888 --> 00:57:47,265
If you're hungry,
try the tacos de pescado.

861
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:48,725
It's their specialty.

862
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:52,479
There's three of them

863
00:57:53,438 --> 00:57:55,065
Will the watchtower
be covered?

864
00:57:56,149 --> 00:57:57,609
Have we ever failed you?

865
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,533
Three guys
are coming for the gringo

866
00:58:04,574 --> 00:58:05,575
Cover them

867
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:06,660
They'll be easy to spot

868
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,380
There's some bad shit
coming down on me,

869
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:20,590
I don't want you two
caught in the middle of it.

870
00:58:20,674 --> 00:58:22,968
So if you don't see me
for a little while...

871
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:24,052
Okay.

872
01:00:51,324 --> 01:00:52,868
There is something
you're not telling us.

873
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:56,746
This gun
belonged to Doroteo Arango.

874
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:58,290
Do you know who he was?

875
01:00:58,373 --> 01:01:02,043
No, but I'm guessing he's dead,
because you have his gun.

876
01:01:02,085 --> 01:01:04,588
He was better
known as Pancho Villa.

877
01:01:05,422 --> 01:01:10,218
This is the same gun he fired in the
Opera Restaurant in Mexico City.

878
01:01:11,178 --> 01:01:13,096
Have you ever been there?
No.

879
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:16,057
The hole's
still there in the ceiling.

880
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,018
They auctioned this gun off

881
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:20,228
a few years ago
in the States.

882
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,605
They thought
that was the original.

883
01:01:26,484 --> 01:01:28,111
Fucking gringos!

884
01:01:28,403 --> 01:01:29,404
Idiots!

885
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:36,995
During the revolution, there
was a shortage of bullets.

886
01:01:37,454 --> 01:01:39,414
And Pancho was
well aware of that.

887
01:01:39,956 --> 01:01:42,500
So he always made sure
that every bullet counted.

888
01:01:46,463 --> 01:01:47,714
Who the fuck are you?

889
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:51,343
If you really need a name,
it's Barnes, Reginald T.

890
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:53,053
And I'm sorry about the mess.
I didn't mean...

891
01:01:54,221 --> 01:01:55,347
Just kill him already

892
01:01:56,848 --> 01:01:58,183
That's not a good idea

893
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:01,645
There are two reasons
not to kill me

894
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,939
You never mentioned
you speak Spanish

895
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:06,316
Nobody asked me

896
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:09,069
I need practice

897
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:14,699
Frank is now
a big problem for you

898
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:17,244
And what's
the second reason?

899
01:02:18,161 --> 01:02:19,329
I can get to him

900
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,165
I did it once already

901
01:02:24,834 --> 01:02:26,086
Don't do me any favors

902
01:02:26,503 --> 01:02:27,837
It's in your best
interest as well

903
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:30,090
This is too much, Javi

904
01:02:30,757 --> 01:02:32,676
A shootout!
Inside the prison

905
01:02:33,176 --> 01:02:34,177
If you get me out of here...

906
01:02:34,803 --> 01:02:36,012
I'll kill Frank

907
01:02:36,596 --> 01:02:37,681
I'm not joking!

908
01:02:38,306 --> 01:02:39,683
This bloodbath
will have consequences

909
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:41,851
Armando...

910
01:02:42,477 --> 01:02:45,397
You chose sides
a long time ago

911
01:02:45,689 --> 01:02:48,191
We can change that
if you want

912
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,526
No problem

913
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:52,362
But why don't you clean up
the mess out there instead

914
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:55,115
Get the fuck out!

915
01:02:57,951 --> 01:02:58,952
Okay

916
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:00,912
Go kill him

917
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:03,081
But don't come back

918
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:06,668
The money you stole
is the price for your life

919
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:09,045
Okay.

920
01:03:10,213 --> 01:03:12,632
I'll need a little cash...

921
01:03:13,008 --> 01:03:14,217
guns“.

922
01:03:14,301 --> 01:03:15,593
And a car

923
01:03:21,975 --> 01:03:23,143
Okay

924
01:03:24,144 --> 01:03:26,896
You've been spending time
with the kid and his mother.

925
01:03:26,938 --> 01:03:30,233
Keep away from them. And this
is the last warning you'll get.

926
01:03:53,089 --> 01:03:54,132
Hurry UP!

927
01:03:54,215 --> 01:03:55,342
Javi's waiting for you!

928
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,110
What name?
Barnes.

929
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,529
Reginald T. Barnes.

930
01:04:17,072 --> 01:04:18,281
Javi.

931
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:20,867
We need to talk, Javi

932
01:04:21,618 --> 01:04:23,286
You look worried

933
01:04:23,578 --> 01:04:24,996
The shootout was
the final straw

934
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,790
The government
is closing the prison

935
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:29,000
They've tried that before

936
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:31,711
It's a surprise raid,
even I don't know when

937
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:33,880
2000 soldiers...
police... snipers

938
01:04:38,385 --> 01:04:39,969
I have to get out of here

939
01:04:40,387 --> 01:04:41,888
It won't be easy

940
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:43,765
If Armando lets you out...

941
01:04:43,807 --> 01:04:46,684
they'll go after him... then
the Mayor, all the way up

942
01:04:47,018 --> 01:04:48,228
I can't go to another prison

943
01:04:48,311 --> 01:04:50,647
Maybe for a while
until things calm down

944
01:04:51,022 --> 01:04:52,482
No, I can't risk
losing the kid

945
01:04:57,404 --> 01:04:58,822
I need that liver transplant

946
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:00,407
And I'll be too weak to move

947
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:03,743
So get me an ambulance
and barricade this place

948
01:05:03,827 --> 01:05:05,787
Nothing interrupts
the operation

949
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:18,007
What do we do with Barnes?

950
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:21,261
Have our boys up north
kill him once Frank is dead

951
01:05:27,016 --> 01:05:29,018
Welcome to the United States.
Hey, thank you.

952
01:05:29,102 --> 01:05:30,812
What's your citizenship?
USA.

953
01:05:30,854 --> 01:05:31,896
Where were you born, sir?

954
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,022
Chicago, Illinois.

955
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,275
What if he doesn't
kill Frank?

956
01:05:39,612 --> 01:05:43,199
Give him forty-eight hours...
then kill him

957
01:06:01,885 --> 01:06:04,471
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>Warren Kauffman's office.</i>

958
01:06:04,554 --> 01:06:08,349
<i>Oh, one second.</i>
<i>I'll see if he's in.</i>

959
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:13,646
Mr. Kauffman. Um, Clint
Eastwood is on the line.

960
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:17,192
Hello?

961
01:06:17,233 --> 01:06:19,736
Hold for
Mr. Eastwood, please.

962
01:06:19,819 --> 01:06:21,154
Thank you.

963
01:06:23,948 --> 01:06:25,325
Hey, how are you doin'?

964
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:26,951
<i>Thank for taking</i>
<i>my call, sir.</i>

965
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:30,413
Well, it's quite
a surprise, Mr. Eastwood.

966
01:06:30,455 --> 01:06:31,748
I'm a fan of your work.

967
01:06:31,831 --> 01:06:33,416
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

968
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,127
You know what, man? This is
not what you guaranteed me.

969
01:06:36,211 --> 01:06:37,295
Excuse me
for a minute, sir.

970
01:06:37,378 --> 01:06:38,963
<i>This is not</i>
<i>what you said.</i>

971
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:40,840
Okay, now, that's better. That's better.
Okay, move along.

972
01:06:40,924 --> 01:06:42,717
That's good.
You all right, man.

973
01:06:42,759 --> 01:06:43,801
You all right.
Yeah.

974
01:06:43,885 --> 01:06:46,262
Hallelujah to ya! Whoo!

975
01:06:46,304 --> 01:06:47,347
Cut!

976
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,432
<i>All right,</i>
<i>set up for take two.</i>

977
01:06:50,642 --> 01:06:52,352
Sorry, sir.
I'm a workin' stiff.

978
01:06:52,435 --> 01:06:54,020
You gotta make your time
where you can.

979
01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:56,940
What can I do
for you, Mr. Eastwood?

980
01:06:57,023 --> 01:06:58,358
Well, you know,
I'm going to be

981
01:06:58,441 --> 01:06:59,734
in San Diego
for a couple of days

982
01:06:59,776 --> 01:07:01,736
playing a golf tournament,

983
01:07:01,778 --> 01:07:04,280
and all the proceeds are going
to the Stroke Association.

984
01:07:04,364 --> 01:07:06,324
I play golf myself,
you know.

985
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:08,493
Well, my associates
and I are looking

986
01:07:08,576 --> 01:07:10,078
to make a meeting
with you if we could.

987
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,497
Sit down and let
you know how you could

988
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,916
be part of
the Stroke Association.

989
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:16,209
It's doing good
in the community

990
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:18,211
and it's a damn
decent tax write-off.

991
01:07:18,294 --> 01:07:19,879
Well, it sounds interesting.

992
01:07:19,963 --> 01:07:22,840
You think you could make it to
my office tomorrow morning?

993
01:07:22,924 --> 01:07:26,469
Yeah, I'll have
my assistant, Mr. Barnes,

994
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:27,679
be in touch with
your assistant.

995
01:07:28,137 --> 01:07:29,347
<i>Make all the arrangements.</i>

996
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:30,473
Great.

997
01:07:30,557 --> 01:07:33,226
You'll, uh, make my day.

998
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:35,228
Ha ha. That's a good one.

999
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:57,375
Go!

1000
01:08:16,561 --> 01:08:17,687
Regina, it's time!

1001
01:08:17,895 --> 01:08:19,022
Move it!

1002
01:08:19,314 --> 01:08:20,732
I'll take better care
of this one.

1003
01:08:20,815 --> 01:08:22,525
We have to do this
as soon as possible.

1004
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:24,402
Get in

1005
01:08:25,528 --> 01:08:26,696
Don't come out,
no matter what

1006
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:28,364
I need the donor.

1007
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:36,914
Thanks.

1008
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,833
Microwave's over there.

1009
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:41,878
Oh, I'm not going
to eat this shit.

1010
01:09:01,314 --> 01:09:03,858
What the fuck
is going on here?

1011
01:09:04,734 --> 01:09:07,362
All right,
pop the fucking hood.

1012
01:09:58,204 --> 01:09:59,288
I admire your courage

1013
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,623
I didn't expect any less

1014
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:05,962
You know we'll kill you
and find the kid

1015
01:10:07,463 --> 01:10:09,006
Why waste more time?

1016
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,552
I treated you well

1017
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,886
Took care of you both

1018
01:10:14,762 --> 01:10:16,305
I tried to find
someone else

1019
01:10:16,889 --> 01:10:18,015
But time ran out

1020
01:10:32,572 --> 01:10:33,990
<i>Hi, I have Warren Kauffman</i>

1021
01:10:34,031 --> 01:10:36,159
<i>from REPCOM for Mr. Jackson.</i>

1022
01:10:36,242 --> 01:10:37,910
One moment, please.

1023
01:10:38,494 --> 01:10:40,955
I have Warren Kauffman
on the line.

1024
01:10:41,372 --> 01:10:42,415
The ship guy?

1025
01:10:42,498 --> 01:10:43,499
That's what they said.

1026
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:44,917
Put him through.

1027
01:10:45,334 --> 01:10:46,335
Hello?

1028
01:10:47,336 --> 01:10:51,215
Hello, Mr. Jackson, thanks for taking...
Excuse me for a minute.

1029
01:10:54,385 --> 01:10:55,553
Thanks for taking my call.

1030
01:10:55,636 --> 01:10:57,263
My pleasure, sir.
How can I help you?

1031
01:10:57,346 --> 01:11:00,349
I understand you represent
a Mr. Frank Fowler.

1032
01:11:02,435 --> 01:11:03,728
Yeah, in some matters.

1033
01:11:03,811 --> 01:11:05,980
Are you familiar with my
business, Mr. Jackson?

1034
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:09,609
From what I hear you're the
largest ship builder in America.

1035
01:11:09,692 --> 01:11:10,860
<i>Among other things.</i>

1036
01:11:10,902 --> 01:11:14,530
<i>Look, can I assume that our</i>
<i>conversation is confidential?</i>

1037
01:11:15,615 --> 01:11:18,201
Yes. Of course.

1038
01:11:18,284 --> 01:11:19,702
Good.

1039
01:11:19,744 --> 01:11:25,041
I'm interested specifically in
Mr. Fowler's marshmallow export business.

1040
01:11:29,837 --> 01:11:31,088
I don't know what you mean.

1041
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:33,090
You don't?
Well, then, I'm sorry,

1042
01:11:33,174 --> 01:11:34,926
I must've been given
the wrong information.

1043
01:11:35,009 --> 01:11:36,052
Perhaps.

1044
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:40,097
Well, how specifically
can I help you, sir?

1045
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:42,475
Could I arrange
a meeting with Mr. Fowler?

1046
01:11:42,558 --> 01:11:44,685
I'd have to check
his availability...

1047
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:45,895
Ooh la la.

1048
01:11:45,978 --> 01:11:47,563
...but I'm sure we can
work something out.

1049
01:11:47,605 --> 01:11:49,482
Unfortunately, loan only
meet tomorrow morning.

1050
01:11:49,565 --> 01:11:50,566
<i>If that's possible.</i>

1051
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:52,068
Uh, if you can
make that work,

1052
01:11:52,151 --> 01:11:55,905
at my office, downtown, the
REPCOM Building, say 10:00 a.m.?

1053
01:11:58,366 --> 01:11:59,659
We'll be there.
Great.

1054
01:12:03,371 --> 01:12:04,497
Ooh.
- Hurry up.

1055
01:12:17,009 --> 01:12:18,010
Don't move!

1056
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:19,887
Who's the brunette?

1057
01:12:20,555 --> 01:12:22,181
What the hell
are you doing here?

1058
01:12:22,265 --> 01:12:23,641
Tomorrow. Morning.

1059
01:12:23,724 --> 01:12:26,102
Very important meeting.
Pick you up at 9:00 a.m.

1060
01:12:26,143 --> 01:12:27,603
Warren Kauffman.

1061
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:30,273
The Warren Kauffman.

1062
01:12:30,857 --> 01:12:31,858
Yep.

1063
01:12:31,941 --> 01:12:33,526
What the hell
does he want from us?

1064
01:12:35,403 --> 01:12:37,113
We don't build ships, do we?

1065
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:41,409
He wants to do
business with us, Frank.

1066
01:12:41,993 --> 01:12:44,370
Okay. 9:00.

1067
01:12:55,298 --> 01:12:56,424
You're a good mother

1068
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,634
But I'm tired

1069
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:03,055
You want my liver?

1070
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,391
Here's your fucking liver

1071
01:13:41,135 --> 01:13:42,678
Hi.
- Hi.

1072
01:13:42,762 --> 01:13:44,096
I'm here to see Mr. Kauffman.

1073
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,222
Mr. Barnes?

1074
01:13:45,306 --> 01:13:46,349
And you can only
be Stephanie.

1075
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:47,391
Yes.

1076
01:13:47,475 --> 01:13:49,268
So good to meet you, at last.
Likewise.

1077
01:13:49,352 --> 01:13:51,228
Mr. Kauffman is ready for you.
Excellent

1078
01:13:51,312 --> 01:13:52,855
Go ahead and just follow me.

1079
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:55,149
Uh, we were expecting
Mr. Eastwood, plus four.

1080
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:56,525
Oh, well,
the tall one is en route.

1081
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:58,819
You'll hear him drop in,
cowboys and helicopters,

1082
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:00,196
he'll probably
buzz the building.

1083
01:14:00,237 --> 01:14:03,032
Are you
expecting rain, Mr. Barnes?

1084
01:14:03,115 --> 01:14:04,825
Well, you never
can tell, Stephanie.

1085
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,160
Please, step in.
Thank you.

1086
01:14:06,202 --> 01:14:08,663
Mr. Barnes is here, his
associates are on their way.

1087
01:14:08,704 --> 01:14:10,456
Mr. Barnes.
Thank you, Stephanie.

1088
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:12,416
Please show the gentlemen
in when they arrive.

1089
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,460
Mr. Kauffman.
So nice to meet you.

1090
01:14:14,543 --> 01:14:17,505
Likewise. And thank you for
taking us on such short notice.

1091
01:14:17,546 --> 01:14:19,340
My pleasure.
Look at this view.

1092
01:14:19,382 --> 01:14:20,383
Mmm.

1093
01:14:20,466 --> 01:14:22,760
<i>And this is, uh,</i>
<i>Think Outside the Box.</i>

1094
01:14:22,843 --> 01:14:23,886
You know it.

1095
01:14:23,928 --> 01:14:24,971
<i>L live by it.</i>

1096
01:14:26,639 --> 01:14:28,391
Hi, we have an appointment
with Mr. Kauffman.

1097
01:14:28,474 --> 01:14:30,309
Yes, they're expecting you.

1098
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:49,912
- Please, step in.
- Thank you.

1099
01:14:49,954 --> 01:14:52,081
Gentlemen.
What took you so long?

1100
01:14:52,581 --> 01:14:54,083
Mr. Kauffman's
just in the restroom,

1101
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:55,626
he should be out
in a minute.

1102
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:56,752
That chopper turn up yet?

1103
01:14:56,836 --> 01:14:58,838
No, not yet.
No? Okay.

1104
01:14:58,921 --> 01:15:00,423
Well, make yourself at home.

1105
01:15:00,506 --> 01:15:02,299
Ah, Warhol?
No.

1106
01:15:02,383 --> 01:15:04,176
That's a nine-dot puzzle.

1107
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:07,013
Now the trick is you got to
join all nine dots together

1108
01:15:07,096 --> 01:15:10,099
using only four lines, never
take your pen off the page.

1109
01:15:10,141 --> 01:15:11,267
Oh.

1110
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:12,601
You gentlemen like
something to drink?

1111
01:15:12,643 --> 01:15:14,103
A coffee would be great.
Sir?

1112
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:15,438
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

1113
01:15:15,813 --> 01:15:17,148
Okay.

1114
01:15:24,113 --> 01:15:26,532
Hey, I think I got it.

1115
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:32,955
Oh...

1116
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:46,677
Oh, my God!

1117
01:15:46,761 --> 01:15:48,220
Mr. Kauffman!

1118
01:15:49,597 --> 01:15:50,681
Mr. Kauffman!

1119
01:15:50,765 --> 01:15:53,184
Oh, my God! Mr. Kauffman!

1120
01:16:09,283 --> 01:16:10,868
There's a bomb or something!

1121
01:16:10,951 --> 01:16:12,036
Mr. Kauffman...

1122
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,873
Mr. Kauffman! Oh!

1123
01:16:15,956 --> 01:16:17,249
Are you okay?

1124
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,752
Uh, my God! Oh, my God!

1125
01:16:22,004 --> 01:16:23,631
The kid is stable.

1126
01:16:23,672 --> 01:16:25,674
Barely missed his liver.

1127
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:27,885
How fast can we go?

1128
01:16:29,095 --> 01:16:30,304
First thing in the morning.

1129
01:16:30,346 --> 01:16:31,514
No.

1130
01:16:31,555 --> 01:16:33,599
No, you tell me
when you're done.

1131
01:16:33,682 --> 01:16:35,184
We go tonight.

1132
01:16:39,814 --> 01:16:41,232
<i>Put it in your mouth!</i>
<i>Put it in your mouth!</i>

1133
01:16:41,315 --> 01:16:42,858
<i>Eat the chili, bitch!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

1134
01:16:42,942 --> 01:16:45,111
Suck it! Suck it!

1135
01:16:45,194 --> 01:16:47,196
Eat it all! Take it all!

1136
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:51,492
Now! Now! Now! Now!

1137
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:01,961
You better feel something.

1138
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,547
All right, do it again.

1139
01:17:04,588 --> 01:17:06,841
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

1140
01:17:06,882 --> 01:17:09,009
<i>Open your mouth, puta!</i>

1141
01:17:23,482 --> 01:17:24,567
Hi.

1142
01:17:26,152 --> 01:17:27,736
How did you find me?

1143
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:29,738
I followed the bread crumbs.

1144
01:17:29,822 --> 01:17:32,408
Even in a town like Tijuana,
you're kinda unique.

1145
01:17:34,034 --> 01:17:35,828
I need to spring somebody
out of prison here.

1146
01:17:35,911 --> 01:17:37,997
Oh, yeah,
what's his name, 1.7 mil?

1147
01:17:38,914 --> 01:17:40,916
Stupid son of a bitch, why
didn't you let me help you?

1148
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,376
We could have
been splitting this.

1149
01:17:42,418 --> 01:17:43,419
And now what?

1150
01:17:43,502 --> 01:17:45,087
Now fat chance
getting it from Javi,

1151
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:47,214
before he's shipped off to
Federal with a new liver.

1152
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:50,384
What was that?

1153
01:17:50,426 --> 01:17:52,261
It's over, the government
is shutting the place down.

1154
01:17:52,344 --> 01:17:54,263
They're raiding
the joint tonight.

1155
01:17:54,305 --> 01:17:55,681
That fucking moron, Javi,

1156
01:17:55,764 --> 01:18:00,394
he's having an organ
transplant in the middle of a raid.

1157
01:18:03,689 --> 01:18:05,608
You're not going to leave
me like this, are you?

1158
01:18:06,275 --> 01:18:07,693
I sure as fuck am.

1159
01:18:07,776 --> 01:18:09,737
These credentials will
come in mighty handy.

1160
01:18:09,778 --> 01:18:11,155
Hey, hey, hey-

1161
01:18:11,614 --> 01:18:13,115
You said my car
was in the impound?

1162
01:18:13,949 --> 01:18:14,950
Where is that?

1163
01:18:15,034 --> 01:18:16,911
There's a federal impound,
next to the race track.

1164
01:18:16,952 --> 01:18:19,455
I wouldn't exactly
call it a car anymore.

1165
01:18:21,332 --> 01:18:22,333
Ladies

1166
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,210
Here

1167
01:18:25,711 --> 01:18:26,712
Take your time.

1168
01:18:27,379 --> 01:18:28,672
Make him squeal.

1169
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:45,731
...but you got
the money, right?

1170
01:18:46,565 --> 01:18:47,566
I paid you, fucker!

1171
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:48,651
They're here

1172
01:18:48,943 --> 01:18:50,236
Go fuck your mother!

1173
01:18:56,742 --> 01:18:58,786
Make sure Armando
has the ambulance ready

1174
01:19:00,537 --> 01:19:03,040
Leave that open
for a quick getaway

1175
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:06,043
Nobody gets in here!

1176
01:20:06,312 --> 01:20:07,938
US Consulate.

1177
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:36,462
Ah!

1178
01:22:50,559 --> 01:22:51,935
Put it back.

1179
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:56,648
Where's the boy's mother?

1180
01:22:58,901 --> 01:23:00,152
In the dungeon.

1181
01:23:00,402 --> 01:23:02,738
Bring her here
or I'll kill your brother.

1182
01:23:07,075 --> 01:23:09,328
Okay. Okay, okay.

1183
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:23,175
Park over there

1184
01:23:54,623 --> 01:23:56,458
Thank you, Malaina.

1185
01:23:56,542 --> 01:23:57,543
Go fuck yourself!

1186
01:24:05,759 --> 01:24:06,760
He'll be okay

1187
01:24:13,976 --> 01:24:14,977
Thank you

1188
01:24:15,644 --> 01:24:17,229
They were assholes

1189
01:24:18,188 --> 01:24:19,481
Just like my husband

1190
01:24:23,485 --> 01:24:24,486
Stop!

1191
01:24:26,154 --> 01:24:27,656
It's an emergency!

1192
01:24:28,282 --> 01:24:30,075
Help us to the ambulance!

1193
01:24:31,034 --> 01:24:32,035
Be careful

1194
01:24:35,163 --> 01:24:36,164
What happened?

1195
01:24:36,206 --> 01:24:38,083
Male, ten years old

1196
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:40,335
Under anesthesia
for liver transplant

1197
01:24:40,711 --> 01:24:42,212
Vital signs are stable

1198
01:24:45,841 --> 01:24:46,842
Mine.

1199
01:24:46,925 --> 01:24:48,176
He needs to get
to a hospital

1200
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:24,713
We're in a hurry

1201
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:27,382
<i>Gracias.</i>

1202
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:23,480
Reginald T. Barnes?

1203
01:26:25,732 --> 01:26:27,609
Honey, want some coffee?

1204
01:26:38,995 --> 01:26:41,456
No!

1205
01:26:58,432 --> 01:26:59,516
<i>Hola.</i>

1206
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,769
Please.

1207
01:27:07,315 --> 01:27:08,316
<i>Salud.</i>

1208
01:27:10,152 --> 01:27:11,194
To us

1209
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:20,829
Can I bite you?

1210
01:27:23,498 --> 01:27:24,499
Yes

1211
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,418
Only if it's really hard

1212
01:27:26,668 --> 01:27:28,086
And don't leave any marks

1213
01:27:29,838 --> 01:27:30,881
Mom!

1214
01:27:31,214 --> 01:27:32,215
Come

1215
01:27:32,591 --> 01:27:33,592
Hurry up

1216
01:27:34,885 --> 01:27:36,303
I'll be back

1217
01:27:42,642 --> 01:27:44,519
<i>Well, boys and girls,</i>

1218
01:27:44,603 --> 01:27:49,024
