1
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:45,748
Hi.

2
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:54,632
Have we met somewhere before?
M m-hm, I don't think so.

3
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:58,260
M m.

4
00:02:58,322 --> 00:03:02,139
Ah.
Late.

5
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,267
Very late, Anna. You put
the alarm back again.

6
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,148
Stautenmeyer is calling into
the office this morning.

7
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,485
We're gonna talk to them
about making me partner.

8
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,820
Wow. That's amazing.

9
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,950
Yeah, you're gonna have to work on
being a little more corporate.

10
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:24,620
Yeah, work on this.
Jesus! Not funny.

11
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,747
Ha ha.

12
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,875
I n other news, the serial killer
now known as Tearjerk Jack...

13
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,087
continues to spread terror
across the East Side.

14
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,714
Police have verified the discovery
of a fifth victim...

15
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,841
in the early hours this morning.

16
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,136
We will continue to follow the
story for you as develop--

17
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,402
Shouldn't you be handing out gold
stars instead of earning yellow

18
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:45,516
ribbons on FarmVille?

19
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,019
I was just checking pre-delays
in the subway.

20
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,819
What do you think?

21
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,238
I like it a little rough
, but I guess...

22
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,825
M r. Stautenmeyer
likes his men a little different.

23
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:05,703
No, he does like it smooth.

24
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,558
Next stop.

25
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,398
"A chance encounter with a
mysterious stranger...

26
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,152
could be a bridge to new
exciting opportunities."

27
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,409
Wow, that looks like modern art.

28
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,037
It's a little Picasso we've
got going over here.

29
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:55,252
Whoa.
Oh, no. It's so not a big deal.

30
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,756
Why don't we get a sponge from over
there and clean it up, okay?

31
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,050
All right.

32
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:17,358
Okay, got it.
 Woo! Woo!

33
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,276
I got you.

34
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,488
Oh, no, you got me.
Oh, no, you got me.

35
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:26,742
Hello. I am here to pick up--
Robert. He's in the sandpit.

36
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh, you're good. I don't know
how you tell them apart.

37
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:34,750
Hello!

38
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,419
Hi, Supernanny. Any hunklicious
divorcée to report...

39
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,797
or are you too busy potty-training
their offspring?

40
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,467
You're so bad. I'm still
on the clock, you know.

41
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,469
So, are you coming today?

42
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,305
Yeah, it's Tuesday, right?
You bet your ass I am.

43
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:54,520
No, I'd rather drink the calories.
M m, six-and-a-half.

44
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,980
Not too bad. I would say seven.

45
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,526
Look left to the bar. Quick.

46
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,946
Ten out of ten. Not too shabby.
Not too shabby at all.

47
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,365
I wouldn't kick him out of
bed for eating crackers.

48
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:11,370
Or anything else.
Does that matter?

49
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,791
Okay. So, I wanna know how was
Justin Timberlake last week?

50
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,878
Hm. Had a few drinks.
Went back to his--

51
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,631
Need I elaborate?

52
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,592
I had more fun with
a broken vibrator.

53
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,513
Does it ever get tiring
, being a slut?

54
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,765
I'll tell you one thing
you never get tired of.

55
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,269
That moment when you wake
up and for a second...

56
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,690
you have no idea where you are or who
the hell the guy is next to you.

57
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,775
I live for that stuff.

58
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,653
I guess it complicates things
a little bit less, right?

59
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,656
Yeah.
I mean, sometimes with Bryce--

60
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,450
No, enough with Bryce.

61
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,410
If you're done with him
, just hand him over.

62
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:56,206
Come on, girls. Big smiles.
Just think in three months...

63
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,418
we will be sipping those dirty
martinis on Laguna Beach.

64
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,882
Hey, guys, I was-- I wanted
to tell you, but, um...

65
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,051
I don't think I'm gonna be
able to make it this year.

66
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:10,387
What?
It's sacred.

67
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,264
It's a ritual.

68
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,224
I know. It's just Bryce wants
to take us to Vegas...

69
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,685
to celebrate our first
year and stuff.

70
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:19,897
Classy.
He's so gonna pop the question.

71
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,274
Okay, listen, we just
moved in together.

72
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,002
And what are you waiting
for? Get dumped for some

73
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,278
skanky-ass cheerleader?

74
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,240
If he pulls out a ring, you
should snatch it, girl.

75
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,284
Thank you.

76
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,786
You know, once you've squeezed
out a couple of rug-rats...

77
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,207
you'll fix up some money pit and
slide contentedly into senility.

78
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:43,170
Francine, for a second there...
I forgot why you're still single.

79
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,802
Oh, my
God, you guys.

80
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,264
Mister "Ten-Out-of-Ten" over there
is totally checking me out.

81
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,686
Oh, well, no sense in letting
him go to waste.

82
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,939
Another drink.

83
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,149
Yeah, I know, it's cool. I
mean, he's not hot at all.

84
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,401
I mean, he's certainly
not my type.

85
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,907
Excuse me, between my
nose and my rack...

86
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,243
which do you think I should
get done first?

87
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,453
Major alcoholic. She's got
problems. Come on.

88
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,914
I'm sorry. Wilcox and
Third, please.

89
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,874
Get in. I'll drive you home.

90
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,835
It's okay. Unlike some people
I know, I can walk.

91
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,921
Are you
getting in or what?

92
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,013
Hey, ma'am, look out!

93
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,561
Hey, check it out.

94
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,979
No!

95
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,000
Anna? Anna!

96
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,941
Will she be okay?

97
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,277
Somebody tell me. They ran
all the tests again this morning.

98
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:05,872
Look, she's waking up.
Anna?

99
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,209
Anna, can you hear me?

100
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,257
- Hey, chica, we're here.
- Are you okay?

101
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:27,644
Who are you?
Anna, it's me. It's Bryce.

102
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,233
Oh, my head.
You're fine.

103
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,152
My head hurts.

104
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,613
Nothing is broken. You are
a blue-eyed miracle, kid.

105
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,867
Don't. Don't touch me.

106
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:46,079
Who are you?
It's us, chica.

107
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,957
Hey, don't you recognize us?

108
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,172
Anna? You've been unconscious
for over a week.

109
00:11:55,242 --> 00:12:00,177
Doctor. He's not Bryce.
It's okay, Anna. Calm down.

110
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,388
I's not him. It's not
Bryce. I know Bryce.

111
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,891
Anna, you just need to relax.
You need some rest.

112
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:09,853
You got a nasty bump on your head.
It's all right, Anna.

113
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:14,274
Please, l-l don't need that.
Anna!

114
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:18,653
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

115
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:23,450
Anna! Anna, wait.
She's confused.

116
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,374
Do you think she's okay?

117
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,336
It's okay.

118
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:42,385
Anna, sweetheart.
 Open the door.

119
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:47,474
Anna, it's me.
Okay. Okay.

120
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:50,361
Sh, sh....

121
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,121
Take a close look at this, please.

122
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:25,095
And this one?
Is that the same face you see?

123
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:31,601
No.
Both photos are of the same man.

124
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,692
What you are experiencing are
symptoms of prosopagnosia.

125
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:43,196
Sorry, proso-what?
Prosopagnosia or face blindness.

126
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,782
It-it's an impairment in
face perception...

127
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,201
caused by a lesion on
the temporal lobe.

128
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,371
It's this part of the brain that
allows us in a nanosecond...

129
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,958
to compare someone's face with all
of the faces stored in our memory.

130
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,960
You wanna dumb it down
a little bit, Doc?

131
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,170
Every time you look at
someone's face...

132
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:03,300
it's as if you've never seen them
before. Even someone close to you.

133
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,012
Even your own reflection.

134
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:11,391
However, confirmed cases of
prosopagnosia are extremely rare.

135
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:15,520
Anna is probably suffering
a slight cerebral shock.

136
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,566
If the symptoms persist, you'll need
to see another specialist...

137
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,735
for a second opinion.

138
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,074
Twenty-dollar words for stuff...

139
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,411
they know nothing about.
Psychiatrists for ya.

140
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,837
I had the place cleaned
for when you came back.

141
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,006
Thank you.

142
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,264
You know, I really thought I
was gonna lose you there.

143
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,600
Come here.

144
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,317
So, are you getting used
to my new looks?

145
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:08,323
Are they an improvement at least?
Yeah, I mean... no.

146
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:15,372
Y-you look great.
You see? It's not all bad.

147
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,290
It'll pass.

148
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,251
And everything will go back
to the way that it was.

149
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,464
Hey, at least some things
never change.

150
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:28,635
Oh, that'll be your dad.

151
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,014
He's been calling non-stop on some
crackly line from Argentina.

152
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:37,227
Hello. Uh, no.

153
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:41,898
I just brought her home.
No, I understand but--

154
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:47,028
If you want.
Okay, I'll bring her in.

155
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:53,535
All right.
Hey.

156
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,870
Everything okay?

157
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,332
Yeah.

158
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,877
Who was that?

159
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,423
It was just the police. Some detective.
He keeps calling.

160
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,259
He wants to take your
statement. Now.

161
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,061
Guess you put a pretty
good fight, huh?

162
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:27,485
How do you know that?
I called your cell.

163
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,322
On the bridge, remember?
I heard things.

164
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,617
I'm the one who called the police.

165
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,922
Any more internal memos
end up in the Tribune...

166
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,467
I'll personally tear the son
of a bitch a new ass hole.

167
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,136
M iss Marchant, correct?
How's the head?

168
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:56,056
You're the boyfriend?
Yeah. Bryce.

169
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,807
I'm Kerrest. This way.

170
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:02,854
Watch your step.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

171
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,357
Oh, don't go in. Just sign this
before you do anything.

172
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,568
Oh, you're wearing that
pretty blue tie.

173
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,905
Thank you.

174
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,032
Would you change this goddamn
cell phone ring?

175
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,744
Why don't you just figure it out
yourself, you freaking loser.

176
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,289
A pasta bracelet. It's all
we found on the bridge.

177
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:26,377
No bag, no phone. Are you sure
they didn't fall with you?

178
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,963
I'm gonna ask you not to cancel
your cell phone contract.

179
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,175
The asshole's probably not stupid
enough to use it, but you never know.

180
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,427
So you really think that it's him?

181
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,602
He killed, raped, and wept
over the corpse. You

182
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:39,099
must know how he works.

183
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,434
He's been front page news
for six months now.

184
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,728
They even have a snappy
name for him.

185
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,980
Tearjerk Jack.

186
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:53,530
So, are you gonna protect her?
This, my friend...

187
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,950
is what we have to wade through just
to request police protection.

188
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,203
Twenty of these get dumped on the
Chief's desk every morning.

189
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,083
Cops parked outside your house
24/7 scarfing doughnuts.

190
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,710
Strictly 911 territory.

191
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,965
He's got my papers. He's
got my address.

192
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,722
And he's not stupid enough to
go after the one person who

193
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:15,969
can recognize him, right?

194
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,769
Look... [clears throat]

195
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,982
I'm sorry you had to meet
this year's whackjob.

196
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:39,200
You wanna feel safe?
Help me catch the son of a bitch.

197
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,789
What do you got for me here?

198
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,501
Thirty-five, forty, tall, dark?

199
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,713
I'm not letting you out of here until
you give me more than this.

200
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:58,970
Did you or did you
not see his face?

201
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:02,265
Yes, I did.
Good. We're getting somewhere.

202
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:09,480
Here. Look these over carefully.
Take your time.

203
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,722
This is bullshit! Miss Marchant,
you haven't even

204
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,319
looked at half of these.

205
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,280
I can't remember his face,
okay? Since the accident--

206
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,157
Anna, just--sh.

207
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,659
She just got out of the hospital
. She needs rest.

208
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,962
Rest? You go tell that to
the six women whose throat

209
00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:26,414
he cut from ear to ear!

210
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,625
I apologize if I'm rattling
your cage...

211
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,254
but I'd rather the next time we meet
you weren't lying on a slab.

212
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,258
I can't recognize faces anymore.
Do you understand?

213
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,393
Since the accident I--

214
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:54,984
That-that man could be right in front
of me and I wouldn't know it.

215
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,904
Please, don't waste your time
trying to scare me...

216
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,823
because I am. I already am.

217
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,664
Call the hospital.
They'll explain.

218
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,543
Hey, Nicky.

219
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,014
Lanyon, I've been trying to reach
you for the last two hours.

220
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,809
Man, it's Wednesday.
Nicholas. No cell.

221
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,436
Guess who just woke
up and walked in?

222
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,938
Anna Marchant.

223
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,316
Dammit, not a diet Pepsi.

224
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,530
So, what's the story?
You got any leads?

225
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,615
Can we talk?

226
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:49,122
So, this face blindness...
is it temporary or permanent?

227
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,125
They have no freaking idea.

228
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:58,381
You think it's funny?

229
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,202
Well, she's the only one
who's seen him, and she can't

230
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:02,135
recognize anybody?

231
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,887
You gotta admit it's
pretty far out.

232
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,603
How's the kid doing?

233
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,233
He still hasn't uttered a word.

234
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,365
We have no lead, no I D. Jorgensen
in forensics...

235
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,743
even pushed a trace on
the tear sample...

236
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,412
through the Feds' DNA
database. Nada.

237
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,081
The guy is a freaking ghost.

238
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,710
You're the mind reader with
the fancy diploma.

239
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,962
You know what I think?

240
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,362
The guy has to kill women
to be able to touch them

241
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:43,259
. Well, that's sad.
The melancholy killer theory?

242
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,055
I mean, come on. You gotta
give me more than that.

243
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,684
He weeps because his sexual compulsions
disgust him. He--

244
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,562
he only kills so they won't
see him as he truly is.

245
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,319
Anna Marchant saw him.

246
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,482
Yeah, and she-she survived
. I think he's gonna be

247
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:07,658
really interested in her.

248
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,122
Let me head down the Mission
. Have another crack at that

249
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,162
hobo who fished her out.

250
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,374
Good luck. We got nothing out
of him but sea shanties.

251
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:04,841
Hey, there.
Have we met somewhere before?

252
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:09,303
Hey.

253
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:14,475
I'm sorry.
It was just a bad dream.

254
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,561
Hey, it's okay.

255
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,233
Look, they need me at the
office this morning but--

256
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:27,029
Now, if you want, I can--
No, it's okay. I'm--

257
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm fine.
Are you sure?

258
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:53,681
Hey.
You gave me quite a ride, old boy.

259
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,892
Why weren't you down
at the Mission?

260
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,478
It's dirty there.

261
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,107
Might not be the Savoy
but at least it's safe.

262
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,902
Anything could happen
to you down here.

263
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:10,573
And what do you care, huh?

264
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,955
I got some questions and this time
I really need the answers.

265
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,602
The soonest I
can get out is on Tuesday's

266
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:21,834
red eye from Buenos Aires.

267
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,587
Look, I'll take you to dinner.
I'll spoil you rotten.

268
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,756
Well, that sounds great.
You know what?

269
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,509
Why don't you come meet me at school?
I start back on Wednesday.

270
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,636
Okay, any delays I'll call you.

271
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,472
Can you call me on Bryce's Blackberry?
Do you have that number?

272
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,182
I have it, I have it.
Now listen...

273
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,226
I wish I could've been
there for you.

274
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,436
It's okay, Dad. I love you
, okay? I'll see you then.

275
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:43,689
I love you, too, Snowflake. Bye.
Bye.

276
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,677
Hello.

277
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,723
It's us, chica. Open up!

278
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:23,938
Hi, Sleeping Beauty.
Know who we are this time?

279
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,190
Oh, yeah. I mean, absolutely.

280
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,735
I was just really zoned
out last time.

281
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:33,906
I mean, I'm--
really fine.

282
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,577
Well, look. You made
the front page.

283
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,579
You're famous, bebe.

284
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:49,630
God, I got away.

285
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,674
Oh, my God.

286
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,344
I n heaven there's no beer. Let's
drink it all right here.

287
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,141
I n heaven there's no beer. Let's
drink it all right here!

288
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:05,354
Look who's back. Hello, handsome.
You feel like remembering?

289
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,857
There's a two-six in
it for ya. Right?

290
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:16,365
Oh. I'll call you.
Or I'll text you.

291
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:28,044
Martinis at 11 a. m.
It's almost midnight in Shanghai.

292
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,879
Just drink up.

293
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,423
Nina, you did not
just post that pic.

294
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:36,052
I look squinty. No, no, deleto.
I don't think so!

295
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,054
Por favor.

296
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:59,992
I'll be right back.
Okay, chica.

297
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:22,598
Hello.
Hey.

298
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,558
What do you want now?

299
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:44,912
Do you see anything?

300
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,542
No.

301
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:54,630
Just reminds me of Europe After
the Rain by Max Ernst.

302
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,298
I'm sorry?

303
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,678
So, what was I supposed
to see exactly?

304
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,265
Well, l-l-l guess if I really
have, uh, proso--

305
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:06,976
Prosopagnosia.
Yes.

306
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,644
Well, you tell me.

307
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,273
Can you or can you not
see people's faces?

308
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,694
Well, of course I can
see people's faces.

309
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,865
It's just that they keep
changing all the time.

310
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,076
So, you have the answer
to your question.

311
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,913
Cinnamon candy?

312
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,670
But there must be some sort of
treatment. Medication or--

313
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:41,510
Face blindness isn't something you
just catch, M iss Marchant.

314
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,763
It's something you lose.

315
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,057
What are you telling me?

316
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,103
That I'm gonna be stuck
like this forever?

317
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,527
You're gonna have to get used to
people's faces changing...

318
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:03,866
as soon as you lose sight of them.
Out of a thousand faces...

319
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,037
one might miraculously linger.

320
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,709
Thank you so much.

321
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,880
Doctor.

322
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,008
Faces are the bar code
of the human race.

323
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,803
Ever since mankind
went tribal...

324
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,555
we're constantly looking at
each other's faces...

325
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,893
trying to decide whether they're
friends, foes or lovers.

326
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:35,189
Don't underestimate the seriousness
of your condition, M iss Marchant.

327
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,960
I don't wanna be late for school.

328
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,938
Okay, everybody. Um, can l-can
I get some quiet, please?

329
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:23,404
Great.
Um--

330
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,825
so today, uh, we are going
to play a new type of game.

331
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:32,788
Okay?
And we get to wear stickers!

332
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:36,125
And it's gonna be superfun.

333
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,711
Fun, fun, fun.

334
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,214
So when I call your name...

335
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,717
I want you to come up to
my desk one by one...

336
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:53,017
starting with Caroline Beasley.
Now, for this game to work...

337
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,811
I need you to wear the sticker
all day long...

338
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,980
and don't take it off.
Do you understand?

339
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,149
Yes, M iss Marchant.

340
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,694
Does everybody understand? Please,
keep your stickers on all day.

341
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:10,451
Charlotte Canton.

342
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,745
Stop. You guys, settle
down. Please.

343
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:16,081
Caroline.
I didn't do anything!

344
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,500
I need you to turn around I
need to see your stickers.

345
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:21,962
Hi. I'm here for my daughter.
Your daughter. Uh--

346
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:26,508
Sandra.
Sandra. Sandra. Uh, Sandra.

347
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:31,555
Uh--
Miss, Miss. Miss, I need to go pee.

348
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,724
Okay, sweetie, go pee.

349
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,814
I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a
rush. Where's my daughter?

350
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:46,779
Sorry. Uh, Sandra. Sandra?
Miss, Sandra left with her daddy.

351
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,656
Left with her dad.

352
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,200
You let her go with my ex-husband?
Are you insane?

353
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,203
I told you not to let her
go with my ex-husband!

354
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,706
I have full custody! What
time did they go?

355
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,751
Was he with somebody? I need to
know if he was with somebody.

356
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:06,256
That is really, really important.

357
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,306
Shut up!

358
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,690
I have trouble concentrating
on names, that's all.

359
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,818
But it will pass. I mean
, it will pass.

360
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,987
I n the meantime...

361
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,614
how are you gonna watch the
children in the yard?

362
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,993
Or during swimming classes?
With your stickers?

363
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,163
Anna, you're
my best teacher.

364
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,714
But I'm gonna have to suspend
you. I'm sorry.

365
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,843
If you're better by September,
I'll see what I can do.

366
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,173
"Be wary of appearances...

367
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,550
and an unexpected invitation
to dinner."

368
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,178
Carotid artery and the larynx are
severed, just like the others.

369
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:19,973
Looks like a match.
Missed him by minutes.

370
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:25,104
Kerrest.

371
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,357
He's here. He's here
with me right now.

372
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,859
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What's going on?

373
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,237
I'm on the subway. And
the bag I lost...

374
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,364
he put it right on the
seat in front of me.

375
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,783
Hold on. You saw him?

376
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,495
No, but there-there was somebody
watching me outside the school.

377
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,705
Maybe he followed me
into the train.

378
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:47,876
The bag, you sure it's yours?
Of course I'm sure.

379
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,629
I might not know people's faces,
but I know my own damn handbag.

380
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:54,216
All right. So, the guy you
saw, what's he look like?

381
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,718
How the hell should I know?

382
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,096
It could be any goddamn
one of them.

383
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,014
You gotta help me out
here, all right?

384
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,559
I can't shut down a whole subway
just for a handbag.

385
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,811
Um, okay.

386
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,730
He was wearing an orange shirt,
a bright orange shirt.

387
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,151
Orange shirt. Thank you.
Where are you exactly?

388
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,904
Line four, going to Harlin Street.

389
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,949
You need to listen to me. Whatever
you do, you stay on that train.

390
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,910
Make sure that people are
around you. I'm gonna--

391
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,412
Hello?

392
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:27,499
Hello?

393
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,960
Damn.

394
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,297
Those connecting
to line two, this is your exit.

395
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,728
Make sure where you go.

396
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,926
No!

397
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:14,064
You stay away from me. Stay away!
What's going on?

398
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,066
Don't move, buddy. Stay
where you are.

399
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,859
What the hell is going on here?

400
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,153
Anna, you told me to
meet you after work.

401
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,573
I see you running down into the subway.
What the hell is going on here?

402
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,826
Just stand still, sir.

403
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,372
For God's sake, Snowflake. Why
are you so scared of me?

404
00:37:30,442 --> 00:37:34,459
Daddy?
Let go.

405
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:39,131
Oh, Daddy.
 I'm so sorry.

406
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:43,218
Oh, Daddy.
Sweetie, it's all right.

407
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:49,349
It's all right. I'm okay.

408
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:54,146
Hey, it's Anna and Bryce. We're not
home. Please leave a message. Bye.

409
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,648
Hi, Snowflake. Look, I'm
back at the airport.

410
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,567
Listen to me.

411
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,903
You have to tell Bryce
about your condition.

412
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:06,658
You can't just ignore it.

413
00:39:06,362 --> 00:39:10,680
Hi.
M iss Marchant! Hello!

414
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,059
I just wanted to tell
you. Oh, God.

415
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,853
Everything you said...

416
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,315
you were right.

417
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:28,156
When I was 16...
I had two passions in life.

418
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,993
Horse-back riding and opera.

419
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,541
I dreamt of being the next Callas.

420
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,919
Until the horse threw me head-first
into a brick wall.

421
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,171
The accident left me deaf...

422
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,091
and I had to rule out
an operatic career.

423
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,385
You're deaf?

424
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,162
Oh, yes, as a post. I have
to read your lips to know

425
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:52,264
what you're saying.

426
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,686
But I can still hear Wagner.

427
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,189
I just have to close
my eyes and listen.

428
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,528
And you too are going to
have to learn...

429
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,114
to find your inner music.

430
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,909
Everyone always goes on about
sight, hearing, smell.

431
00:40:12,962 --> 00:40:16,746
But there's another sense.
A hidden one.

432
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,958
The Japanese call it "muga."

433
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,086
It's the sense that allows
you to walk...

434
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,715
without having to think about putting
one foot in front of the other.

435
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,426
You lose this sense...

436
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,013
and you will become like some
of my other patients.

437
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,056
Socially paralyzed...

438
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,811
withdrawing from the world into
the safety of isolation.

439
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,814
That's a tempting option.

440
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,735
No, I don't want
that. I wanna live normally.

441
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,070
Every day people are going
to resent you...

442
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,698
for not recognizing who they are.

443
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:56,578
They'll call you rude, forgetful
, stupid, liar.

444
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,497
Now, are you willing
to fight back...

445
00:40:58,562 --> 00:41:03,084
with all your might?
Yeah.

446
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,838
To try and try again without losing
heart, without giving an inch?

447
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,715
Yes.

448
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,718
Good.

449
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:19,017
Then let's get to work.
Allow me to introduce you...

450
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,189
to Mike...

451
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,108
and Maggie.

452
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,611
Hard to tell apart at first
sight, aren't they?

453
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,363
Take a closer look.

454
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,950
Maggie is a little paler,
don't you think?

455
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,578
Oh, and look. She
had this scar...

456
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:42,541
on her forehead.
You see?

457
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,442
It gets more complicated when
you have to pick M ike and

458
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:54,469
Maggie out at a party...
among all the other guests.

459
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,638
Yeah.

460
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:00,225
You're going to learn to focus on
distinctive markers in people.

461
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:04,688
A mole, a tattoo, their gait.

462
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,066
Anything that stands out that makes
it easier to identify that person.

463
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,151
Right.

464
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,154
What's the first thing you look
at in a man, after his face?

465
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:18,410
My friends and I look at his butt.

466
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,745
Well, what else is
there to look at?

467
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,582
Right.

468
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,256
Paler in complexion, small
scar on the forehead.

469
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,814
That's Maggie.

470
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,366
Congratulations.

471
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:16,718
♫ A thousand faces ♫
♫ Looking in All directions ♫

472
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:23,058
♫ Leading me To something ♫
♫ I can never see ♫

473
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:29,230
♫ Why do you think I come here ♫
♫ Why do you think I come round ♫

474
00:43:29,282 --> 00:43:33,568
Hi!
 Hi.

475
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:37,238
So, what's this earth-shattering
thing you have to tell us?

476
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:45,038
The reservation's for seven. Do
you want me to come pick you up?

477
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,499
No, I think I'll meet you there.

478
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,671
Okay.

479
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:57,676
I'll see you later then.
Bye.

480
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:56,568
Hey.

481
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:01,114
Wait. You--

482
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:05,493
You recognized me! Holy crap, can we
call off the straightjacket now?

483
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,787
Oh, thank God.

484
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,522
I couldn't take another wacko
freak-out every time

485
00:45:10,562 --> 00:45:11,708
I tried to kiss you.

486
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,088
So, this--this doesn't
change anymore, right?

487
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,507
You can-you can really
recognize me?

488
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:25,472
Yes, I do.

489
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:29,017
What are you talking about?
You don't recognize me?

490
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,685
I'm your best friend.

491
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,773
I do. With your unique
hair cut...

492
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,234
and the red skirt you always wear
when you're trying to get some.

493
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,405
It's fine. But, oh, God, I just--

494
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,202
When-when-when people are
wearing the same clothes

495
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:49,579
or uniforms, forget it.
They all have the same face to me.

496
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:53,708
What about Bryce? How
is he taking this?

497
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,377
Oh, God.

498
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:01,883
He thinks that I'm adjusting.
I told him that I recognized him.

499
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,968
Please, promise me you
won't tell him.

500
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,930
You're lying to him?

501
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:11,518
I cannot lose him.
Do you understand?

502
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,770
He's the only thing I have left.

503
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,291
Hold it right there.

504
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:38,545
You mean you get to bang a
new guy every night...

505
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,381
without ever cheating
on your boyfriend?

506
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,550
That's like a dream come true.

507
00:46:59,122 --> 00:47:04,612
Another drink.

508
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,669
Take one step. Immerse
yourself...

509
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,964
in people's gestures,
their mannerisms.

510
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:37,061
Watch them until their bodies
become a melody.

511
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:42,066
Hum it, hum it, until you can sing
it at the top of your voice.

512
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,319
Use all your resilience, Anna...

513
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,947
but whatever happens, don't
let the music stop.

514
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:24,400
Hiya.
Oh. Hey. How's it going?

515
00:48:24,482 --> 00:48:28,112
Good.
Didn't expect to see you here.

516
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,866
Well... it's nice to see you.

517
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,410
I'm sorry, I don't remember
your name.

518
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:38,206
Hm.
That's odd.

519
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,458
I, uh...

520
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,963
usually leave a strong
impression on women.

521
00:48:47,522 --> 00:48:51,219
Okay. Well, see you later.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

522
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,262
What's the rush, huh?

523
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,099
Things are just getting
interesting.

524
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,435
Hello. Can I help
you with anything?

525
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,145
Come on, make an effort.

526
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,816
You know who I am.

527
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,573
Officer. Officer, that
man over there.

528
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,201
He's standing right next
to the newsstand.

529
00:49:15,282 --> 00:49:19,539
What are you saying?
That man over--

530
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,546
Never mind.

531
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,133
I am not letting--

532
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,677
Excuse me. Detective
Kerrest, please.

533
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:36,180
Hold on.
I'm gonna check if he's here.

534
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,521
Hey.

535
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,986
Seen any more killers
on public transport?

536
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:53,072
Just don't move.
What are you doing?

537
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,533
I need to check something.
Can you stay there? Please.

538
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,410
I won't move.

539
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,255
Oh, my God!

540
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,842
I recognize your face. I recognize
your face. It's still your face.

541
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,886
Me? You recognize me?

542
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,140
Yes.

543
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,060
It's the first face I recognize
since the incident.

544
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:27,565
Do you think that means something?
I don't know.

545
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,321
I don't know.

546
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:45,291
Hey. Any word from the DA?
Oh. Am I interrupting something?

547
00:50:45,362 --> 00:50:49,045
No.
Are you okay?

548
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,762
M iss Marchant, allow me
to introduce Eric Lanyon

549
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:53,049
, our star pitcher...

550
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,343
ace profiler and all-round
swell guy.

551
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,805
They say it takes a warped mind to
get into a psychopath's head...

552
00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:03,518
but I'm okay. Really.
Nicky had another nosebleed.

553
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:06,771
It's nice to meet you.
You, too. What brings you here?

554
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,816
I saw the papers.

555
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,485
I wanna know everything there
is to know about this man.

556
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,404
You're talking to the right guy.
Lanyon knows everything...

557
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,783
about our friendly neighborhood
whackjob.

558
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,037
I betcha can't pinch a
pen from Lydia's desk.

559
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,964
I don't know if he really
tried to kill you.

560
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,842
He has an odd way for asking
about dinner and a movie.

561
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,303
What he's saying is that maybe he
reacted out of self-defense.

562
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,556
Forgive me, M iss Marchant.

563
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,142
If he really wanted to kill you
once you left hospital...

564
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,602
we wouldn't be standing
here talking about it.

565
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,813
I wanna help catch this guy.

566
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,777
No. I'm not gonna--

567
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:58,156
I'm not gonna recognize his face
like that. I need to see them.

568
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:03,077
I n front of me.
I guess it's worth a shot.

569
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,496
I'd have to run to catch
the D.A. right now.

570
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,457
Very nice to meet you.

571
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,463
So, what's your colleague's theory?

572
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,175
He thinks you made quite an
impression on the freak.

573
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,177
Watched him do his thing
and walked away.

574
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,182
What do you think?

575
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,271
About a year ago when Homicide turned
up the first victim...

576
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:35,109
Lanyon insisted he had the
hallmark of a sociopath.

577
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:39,614
We didn't agree. We thought it was
a one off, a crime of passion.

578
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,325
Six months later, another
dead woman showed up.

579
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,369
She had an 8-year-old son who...

580
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,705
found her on the bedroom floor
with her throat cut.

581
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,003
Now he sees the kid every
chance he gets.

582
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:04,222
I've learned to keep my mouth shut
and trust what Lanyon says.

583
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,979
Sh.

584
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:18,027
Come on, you can drop
the freaking Snow White act.

585
00:53:18,082 --> 00:53:21,405
You've all been here before.
Got a light?

586
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,699
There's no smoking here.
Come on, get in.

587
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:28,371
All right, stand in line
and look straight ahead.

588
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,289
Step it up.

589
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,544
They're all known offenders
that match your statement.

590
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,089
We're waiting on papers to
run DNA checks on 'em.

591
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,424
They're all yours.

592
00:53:42,962 --> 00:53:46,389
How are we doing in here?
Fine.

593
00:53:55,607 --> 00:54:00,861
Do you think they could
move around a little bit?

594
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,562
All right, we've seen enough
of your ugly mugs. I want

595
00:54:03,602 --> 00:54:04,573
you to walk around.

596
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:08,119
Anybody who slacks up gets
a night in a cell.

597
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,122
I just need to see their gestures,
their- their-their movements.

598
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,082
I know it sounds crazy but--

599
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,167
If you want to host a dance
class, it's fine with me.

600
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,628
I said move your asses.
Now, get to it.

601
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,434
It's not any of them.

602
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,812
Are you sure?

603
00:54:36,962 --> 00:54:40,693
Yeah.
At least we tried.

604
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,740
I'm really sorry.

605
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,368
l-l wanted to help.

606
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,791
Anna.

607
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,347
Good luck with the investigation.

608
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,439
Sam! Bad news.

609
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,082
M ulgrew won't go for the
witness protection you requested

610
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:21,942
for Anna Marchant.

611
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,070
After the subway blowout and
the line-up on top...

612
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,489
they don't think she's
100 % compos mentis.

613
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,922
It's absolute bullshit. She's
the only witness we've

614
00:55:28,962 --> 00:55:32,036
got, for God's sake.
We need to up our game here.

615
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,954
Organize another line-up, manana.

616
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,207
Come on. We can't bring in
every perp in the city...

617
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,293
hoping she'll recognize the
inside leg of his trousers!

618
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,880
I guess that'll give you a good
excuse to see her again.

619
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,632
What did you say?

620
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,176
Come on, buddy. You
know what I mean.

621
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,182
One, she has a boyfriend. Two,
there's nothing between us.

622
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,402
Three, even if there was, I swear,
if you mention this to anybody,

623
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:57,478
I will kick your ass.

624
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,731
It's highly unethical and possibly
illegal for a police officer...

625
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:06,570
to fraternize with a key witness.
Whoa. It's that bad?

626
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,990
Screw it.

627
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,333
I mean, seriously, can you picture
the two of us together...

628
00:56:19,402 --> 00:56:22,920
arm in arm at the police ball?
Why not?

629
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:26,132
I always thought you looked rather
fetching in uniform.

630
00:56:30,322 --> 00:56:34,473
Happy birthday, chica.
Thank you.

631
00:56:34,522 --> 00:56:39,019
Quick, quick. Look, look.

632
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,105
A twelve out of ten.
Twelve out of ten.

633
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,607
He's totally
checking me out!

634
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:46,110
So that's what you do on
your girls' nights out?

635
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,613
Well, no, not me. No,
just-just, um--

636
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:52,283
Everybody's dancing tonight.

637
00:56:53,922 --> 00:56:58,372
Even you, Bryce.

638
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,466
I'm gonna go get us a drink.
Okay.

639
00:57:08,522 --> 00:57:12,636
Did you see that? Totally on me.
Where is he?

640
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:17,475
Okay, okay, back up.
Give her a chance.

641
00:57:17,522 --> 00:57:20,394
Okay, what do I do?
Just act natural, okay?

642
00:57:20,442 --> 00:57:23,939
Natural?
Okay? Go, go, go.

643
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,232
Okay.

644
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,559
Okay, okay.

645
00:58:06,202 --> 00:58:10,402
Hey, there you are.
What took you so long?

646
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,779
Which one is mine?

647
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,536
Oh, God. You know I
don't like champagne.

648
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,204
Oh, yeah.

649
00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:28,045
What did they put in your drink?

650
00:58:35,322 --> 00:58:38,764
Bryce!
No, no, no, no. Please, please.

651
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,767
Let me see your notebook.
Let me see it.

652
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:53,070
God, Bryce, it's just so--
I'm-l'm so sorry.

653
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,947
You lied to me.

654
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,158
I'm just as much a stranger
as everyone else.

655
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,995
Was it me you were seeing
when we had sex?

656
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,707
Answer me. Was it me
you were seeing?

657
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:13,173
I'm so, so sorry.
Look, this face blind shit.

658
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,634
I can't deal with it anymore.

659
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,637
Find yourself another
jerk to wear a tie.

660
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,973
Bryce.

661
00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:30,232
Hello.
 Happy birthday, Anna.

662
00:59:30,282 --> 00:59:34,028
Who is this?
Didn't my number show up?

663
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:41,285
You really look drop dread
gorgeous tonight, Anna.

664
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,039
I know your face. I've
seen you before.

665
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:48,876
You don't know my face. You
don't know anyone's face.

666
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,254
If I changed my shirt, you couldn't
tell me from your own father.

667
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,549
You're the only one I don't
need to hide from, Anna.

668
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,762
No, no, that wasn't me. But
maybe I'm that guy there, to

669
00:59:58,802 --> 01:00:00,262
your right. To your right.

670
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,390
No, to your right, Anna! Listen
to what I'm saying!

671
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:08,145
Please don't do this.
You saw me doing those things.

672
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,522
No one has ever seen me before.

673
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,526
You're the only one that can stop
me, Anna, so make it happen!

674
01:00:14,602 --> 01:00:18,489
Or I'll have to make you smile.
Smile from ear to ear.

675
01:00:18,562 --> 01:00:22,868
Please, don't do this!
Such a pretty smile...

676
01:00:22,922 --> 01:00:26,664
it will make me cry.
I'm calling the police.

677
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,875
Go ahead. I have to go anyway. Your
friend's growing impatient.

678
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:33,295
Francine?
Nina?

679
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:36,674
Francine?
Nina?

680
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,759
Francine!

681
01:00:40,922 --> 01:00:43,472
Francine. Francine!
What the hell?

682
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:49,103
Nina. Nina!

683
01:00:49,162 --> 01:00:53,691
Anna? What's happening?
Anna, Anna, what's happening?

684
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,568
He's here. He just called me from
my phone. Where's Francine?

685
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,947
She was dancing with M r. "1
2-Out-of-10" just a moment ago.

686
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,116
We have to find her. We have
to find her. He's here.

687
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:07,746
All right, I'll call the police.
Francine!

688
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,541
Oh, my God. Nina.

689
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,726
Anna.

690
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,396
Anna!

691
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,204
Set up a perimeter
and comb the area.

692
01:01:49,282 --> 01:01:54,084
I'll deal with the paperwork.

693
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,138
Okay. You got me. I confess.

694
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,141
Come on, you're one scratch away
from a perfect DNA match.

695
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,060
Sam.

696
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:16,440
What is violet, striped, bloody
and floating in the crapper?

697
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:26,742
She wanted to get married
to anyone.

698
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,120
Why didn't he pick me?

699
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:33,540
The man she was dancing
with, did you...

700
01:02:33,602 --> 01:02:37,669
see his face?
No. Only from behind.

701
01:02:37,722 --> 01:02:42,424
Can you describe him to me?
No.

702
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,052
I'll get somebody to take you home.

703
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,474
Oh, Nina.
We'll meet tomorrow.

704
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:58,148
Here. You take care
of yourself, chica.

705
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,623
Your boyfriend is not
answering his phone.

706
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,042
We're still trying to
get a hold of him.

707
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,175
You said you argued.
What was that about?

708
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,766
He found out that, uh...

709
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,980
I was faking him.

710
01:03:47,882 --> 01:03:53,453
Bryce?

711
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,223
You're standing on Bryce's jacket.

712
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,976
Sorry.

713
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,366
It's my phone.

714
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,202
He called me on that phone
before Francine--

715
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,003
Is that the jacket Bryce was
wearing this evening?

716
01:04:45,242 --> 01:04:50,135
Yes, but--
 No, it's not Bryce.

717
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,846
I know him.

718
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,641
Besides, he called me that
night I was on the bridge.

719
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,520
That's a little trick we're gonna
have to ask him about.

720
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,942
Lanyon. Kerrest.

721
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:08,528
No. He's gone, but guess
what we just looked in.

722
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,867
So, let me get this straight.

723
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,286
He strings us for a year,
and bingo...

724
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,538
we get all this juicy evidence
in one night?

725
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,875
I'll chew on that once we get a
DNA sample on this Bryce guy.

726
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,961
I just put out a warrant
for his arrest.

727
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,712
Until then...

728
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,591
I'm not letting her out
of my sight, okay?

729
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,176
I want her totally insulated.

730
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,136
I'll talk to the D.A.
about the tie.

731
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,639
I won't get anything before Monday.
You know the drill.

732
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,022
I'll have her back Monday morning.

733
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,612
Do you trust me?

734
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,743
Let's pack your things. We're
heading out of town.

735
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,036
Rosemary. How are you?

736
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,958
Everyone knows you?

737
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,252
Everyone knows everyone
on Koel Island. Hey.

738
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,504
Good morning.

739
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:53,592
Just one doctor, one ATM, one mail
box. It really is another world.

740
01:06:53,642 --> 01:07:00,265
Where are the other children?
That's the whole school.

741
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:03,393
Mrs. Hayworth. She teaches
all the grades together.

742
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,772
She must be 103 by now.

743
01:07:09,282 --> 01:07:12,861
You went there?
M m-hm.

744
01:07:12,922 --> 01:07:18,492
Didn't turn out too bad...
till you had to play football.

745
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,134
They've arrested Bryce.
He denies everything.

746
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:40,555
He says someone must have slipped
the phone into his pocket.

747
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,602
We'll know soon enough.
They're testing his DNA against

748
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:44,518
the tear sample.

749
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:48,772
Here.

750
01:07:55,962 --> 01:07:59,616
Thank you.
How are you holding up?

751
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,619
I don't know.

752
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,000
It's not just that people's
faces have changed.

753
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,170
It's like...

754
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:16,216
I had to wait...

755
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:20,637
until I didn't recognize myself
to know who I really am.

756
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,057
Close your eyes.

757
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:41,199
That's how you looked when I first
saw you at the hospital.

758
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,244
Please, don't open them just yet.

759
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:55,255
I got a call when they
brought you in.

760
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,402
You were out cold. I looked
down at you like I look down

761
01:09:00,442 --> 01:09:01,553
at Jane Does every day.

762
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,975
I don't know.

763
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,903
It's like I knew you.

764
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,281
Even though I'd never
seen your face.

765
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,788
I know it sounds kinda wacko.

766
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:34,794
As wacko as not recognizing
your own father.

767
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,511
I can do wacko.

768
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,158
Anna.

769
01:12:11,882 --> 01:12:15,288
Anna.

770
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,040
Calm down, Anna, it's
okay. It's me.

771
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,379
Anna, it's me, Kerrest.

772
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,216
Don't you recognize me anymore?

773
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,469
You've shaved?

774
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,767
Yes.

775
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:41,106
Anything that makes the face stand
out, makes it easier to identify.

776
01:12:41,162 --> 01:12:45,902
Oh, God, I was such a fool.
 Don't.

777
01:12:48,402 --> 01:12:52,659
Don't you get it?
It's not you.

778
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:56,913
It's just a trick of my
screwed up brain!

779
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,291
You're nothing special.

780
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,254
You're just another face.

781
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,014
No.

782
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,945
It's you.

783
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,412
It's still you.

784
01:13:38,762 --> 01:13:43,626
It's still you.

785
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,882
Hey, Lanyon.

786
01:13:52,442 --> 01:13:56,514
And they're absolutely sure?
I'll talk to you later.

787
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:04,022
The DNA is negative.
Bryce is not the killer.

788
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,862
Next time you have a
bad dream, I'll--

789
01:14:10,922 --> 01:14:16,284
I'll just leave you to it.
My dreams.

790
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,624
I can recognize faces in my dreams.

791
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:27,295
Hypnotism
is like a carnival mirror.

792
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:31,633
It distorts the truth as
much as reveals it.

793
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:37,055
Or it could have devastating
consequences on your psyche.

794
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,557
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

795
01:14:43,002 --> 01:14:46,064
On the count of three...

796
01:14:46,122 --> 01:14:52,153
I want you to close your eyes...
and travel back in your memories.

797
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:59,911
You can rewind...
pause, fast forward as you wish.

798
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:04,707
I'm counting to three now.
One

799
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,877
two

800
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,839
three.

801
01:15:13,682 --> 01:15:19,597
Anna, I want you to go back...
to the moment before your fall.

802
01:15:29,722 --> 01:15:34,696
Is there anybody there with you?
His face is--

803
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:40,076
It's hazy.

804
01:15:41,482 --> 01:15:47,125
I can't make out his features.
Her impairment is causing a block.

805
01:15:47,202 --> 01:15:50,878
I can't get through it.
Not even with hypnosis.

806
01:15:50,962 --> 01:15:56,593
She knows.
She knows who she is.

807
01:15:56,677 --> 01:16:00,555
Anna? I want you to fuse the
hazy impression...

808
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,100
with your attacker's face.

809
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:07,687
Can you tell me if you've
seen him before?

810
01:16:07,762 --> 01:16:10,648
On the street.
Near your home.

811
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,364
Yes.

812
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,454
Hiya.

813
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,252
Ask her if she saw him the
night he killed Francine.

814
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:34,005
Slow the hell down. I
can't read your lips.

815
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,049
The evening of her birthday.

816
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:41,179
Anna, was he there
at your birthday?

817
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:45,266
Yes.

818
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:48,811
Anna, did you see him through the
two-way mirror in the line-up?

819
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,648
Yes. He's behind the mirror.

820
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,150
Who? Who, Anna? Who's
behind the mirror?

821
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:57,236
But--
Anna, who is it?

822
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,655
I don't know.

823
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:03,951
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

824
01:17:04,002 --> 01:17:06,954
Hey.

825
01:17:15,122 --> 01:17:18,216
Anna, what is it?
He kissed me.

826
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:23,680
Oh, God.
Oh, God, he kissed me.

827
01:17:23,762 --> 01:17:29,602
Anna, are you all right?
It's okay.

828
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,939
Lydia, I need warrants on all six
perps from the last line-up.

829
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,482
I want 'em now.

830
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,802
Make yourself at home. No one
knows you're here. I'll

831
01:17:39,802 --> 01:17:43,074
call you when we get 'em.
Be careful.

832
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,744
Once all this is over...

833
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,788
I'm gonna take you back
to Koel Island.

834
01:17:54,322 --> 01:17:58,381
You promise?
I promise.

835
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,149
What about the DNA?

836
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,443
The tests came back negative.
Four out of six.

837
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:22,238
None of them is our guy, Sam.
We're just jerking off here.

838
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:25,450
Fine, go ahead. Flush your
career if you want.

839
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,842
You know what I think? I think
you and Tearjerk Jack have

840
01:18:28,882 --> 01:18:30,121
something in common.

841
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,442
You're both in love with her,
and that's the only reason

842
01:18:33,482 --> 01:18:34,584
she's still alive.

843
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:38,421
- You coming or not?
- I'm gonna check on something.

844
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:41,716
"The lovers. It's
too late to turn back.

845
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,302
It's time to make the
right choice."

846
01:19:27,242 --> 01:19:31,015
Hey, it's Anna. Bryce called
and he wants to meet up and...

847
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:35,102
and I guess I just owe
him that. So, anyway.

848
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,313
The address of where I'll be--

849
01:20:04,642 --> 01:20:07,510
Hello, Anna.
It's me.

850
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:12,640
I know.

851
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:16,143
Only a one-armed man could tie
a knot worse than you.

852
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,193
I caught a cold when I was in the
detention cell, believe it or not.

853
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:35,121
Hey, I'm taking this
scumbag with me.

854
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,622
Come on.

855
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,709
Watch your head.

856
01:20:41,362 --> 01:20:47,341
Look, I--
I've acted like a total asshole.

857
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:50,052
And-and not just the
other evening.

858
01:20:50,122 --> 01:20:53,097
For a long time now.

859
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,560
And I'm sorry.

860
01:21:02,322 --> 01:21:06,319
Excuse me.
Here's your drinks.

861
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:17,246
Bryce, you know I don't
like champagne.

862
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,772
I thought it felt right.

863
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,199
Tickets to Vegas.

864
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,015
And after I squeeze out
a couple rug-rats...

865
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,977
we'll buy some old money
pit and...

866
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:24,647
slide contentedly off
into senility.

867
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,902
Oh, God. Bryce, l-l tried.

868
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,488
I really did.

869
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:38,452
Every time your face kept changing
, I tried so hard.

870
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:43,541
And you know what I found out?

871
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:47,002
That the way you look or don't
look each morning, it really

872
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:48,170
wouldn't matter...

873
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:53,009
if I truly loved you.

874
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,349
Uh, I--

875
01:23:02,162 --> 01:23:07,023
I really didn't expect this...
after getting your text message.

876
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,280
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

877
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:57,073
Hey, has anybody seen
my cell phone?

878
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,516
Bryce!

879
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,519
We have to get out of here.
We've been set up.

880
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,896
I think he's here.

881
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,694
Yo, Columbo. You got a light?

882
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:47,081
Five new messages.

883
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:49,625
Hey, it's Anna. Bryce called
and he wants to meet up.

884
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:54,380
And I guess I just owe him that.
Anyway, the address where I'll be--

885
01:24:54,442 --> 01:24:59,802
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

886
01:24:59,882 --> 01:25:06,392
It's Kerrest. Leave a message.
Hi, it's Anna. I can't get--

887
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,561
Thanks for letting me smoke, man.

888
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:14,316
Relaxed. Not like that pig who
took my smoke at the line-up.

889
01:25:14,362 --> 01:25:18,696
You should've smacked that prick.
No smoking.

890
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,323
He's behind the mirror.

891
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:24,618
Come on, you're one scratch away
from a perfect DNA match.

892
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,872
I learned to keep my mouth shut
and trust what Lanyon says.

893
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,641
Whatever
happens, Anna...

894
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:50,686
don't let the music stop.

895
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:07,036
Bryce.

896
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,753
Kiss me.

897
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,522
Think, Lydia. Lanyon was at
the line-up. He had access

898
01:26:35,562 --> 01:26:36,482
to all the evidence.

899
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,276
The kid was the perfect smokescreen
. It all fits.

900
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,278
No, screw the backup.
We don't have--

901
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:45,783
Anna! Anna, wait!
Dammit.

902
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,576
Hey, man, where are you going?

903
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,913
Grey shirt. Black jacket.

904
01:26:57,162 --> 01:27:02,258
Look out!
 Anna! Anna!

905
01:27:02,322 --> 01:27:06,178
Anna!
Lanyon, drop it.

906
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:09,056
Drop the gun, shithead. It's me. Don't
listen to him. He's Lanyon.

907
01:27:09,122 --> 01:27:11,976
I'm Kerrest.
Anna, run!

908
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:16,272
Stay right there. Drop the gun.
You drop it.

909
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,204
Lanyon.

910
01:28:03,922 --> 01:28:08,907
Anna.
Where are you?

911
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:10,492
Anna, it's me.

912
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:19,103
Anna! Make sure you stay hidden.

913
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,732
Backup's gonna be here.

914
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:35,285
First, there's a bloody kid...

915
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,372
who sees me off his mother. You
think he'll tell someone?

916
01:29:38,442 --> 01:29:46,588
No. Not a single peep in a year.
The traumatized little fucker.

917
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,470
And then there's you, Anna.

918
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:59,393
You saw me crying when that's--

919
01:30:01,882 --> 01:30:07,359
That's not allowed.
It wa-it was a miracle.

920
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:10,195
You lost all the other
faces because of it.

921
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:19,371
Oh, no, no, no, you're not doing
your little diving act again.

922
01:30:19,442 --> 01:30:23,834
Goddammit, Anna.

923
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,711
The safety catch.

924
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:29,381
This, Anna, is why I like
blades so much.

925
01:30:29,442 --> 01:30:33,802
Anna!

926
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,692
Anna.

927
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:54,031
Don't move! I mean it.
It's me, Anna.

928
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,742
If we stay here, we'll make
one hell of a target.

929
01:30:56,802 --> 01:31:02,539
Now, give me back my gun.
Stay where you are. I mean it.

930
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,585
Anna, on-on Koel Island...

931
01:31:06,669 --> 01:31:08,754
there's a school with
half a dozen pupils.

932
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,717
You recognize me now?

933
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:33,195
What did you promise me before
you left? What did you say?

934
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,989
Very good. I could have told Lanyon
about the weekend...

935
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:39,243
but that's something only
I can know, right?

936
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,536
Anna.

937
01:31:49,282 --> 01:31:53,966
Look out!

938
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:07,563
I knew...

939
01:32:08,722 --> 01:32:13,569
you were the one...
who'd end this shit.

940
01:32:19,158 --> 01:32:21,159
Give me the gun.

941
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:27,416
Here.

942
01:32:59,402 --> 01:33:03,327
I guess...
you will never take her...

943
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:06,830
to the police ball.

944
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,629
Oh, no.

945
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:26,725
Oh, God.

946
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:32,564
Oh, God, no, no.
No, no.

947
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:35,317
Please, don't-don't move.

948
01:33:36,922 --> 01:33:41,490
Don't move, please.
I'm fine. Seriously, I'm fine.

949
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:45,243
Don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me.

950
01:33:45,322 --> 01:33:49,623
You can't leave me.
Oh, God.

951
01:33:51,322 --> 01:33:55,921
Sh, don't move.

952
01:33:56,002 --> 01:34:00,258
You'll find someone else.
You'll see.

953
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,552
You'll find someone else.

954
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,638
You don't have the
right to leave me.

955
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,392
I love you.

956
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:12,062
I know you don't.

957
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,817
I'm just another face
in the crowd.

958
01:34:21,802 --> 01:34:26,451
Don't leave.
Stay with me.

959
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:34,584
No.

960
01:34:36,602 --> 01:34:41,633
Don't leave me!
Don't go!

961
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:46,179
Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't go.

962
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:49,451
I live here now.

963
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:53,246
The school board accepted
my transfer request.

964
01:35:56,209 --> 01:36:00,921
I can identify each of
my pupils perfectly.

965
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:06,927
As well as the handful of people who
live here in the off season.

966
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:11,723
Nina comes to see me
from time to time.

967
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:14,226
She's still single.

968
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:20,649
I'm just taking it one
step at a time.

969
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:26,363
Sometimes I see a face...

970
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:31,785
and for a second it's like
I see him again.

971
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:36,081
It's the only way I can keep
his face in my memory.

972
01:36:36,162 --> 01:36:43,588
Mommy!
But when I look into her face...

973
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:47,175
whatever it was that let him
get through to me...

974
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,845
he passed it on to her.

975
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:54,724
And just when I thought I'd
lost everything...

976
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,227
I found a face.

977
01:36:58,842 --> 01:37:02,899
One face...
in which I can always read...

978
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:06,695
love.

979
01:39:39,322 --> 01:39:44,310
