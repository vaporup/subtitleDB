00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,300
Where is Frank?

James Lacey
7 YEARS

7
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,300
You've got yourself a friend.

8
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Bets are over.

9
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,000
He's a handycap.
This one's missing a leg.

10
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,000
- I'm going for two on red.
- Too late, Frank, the runners are on the track

11
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
- Well give it back.
- Sorry, Frank, you owe the bank.

12
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,300
- Transfer?
- I'm out, Frank.

13
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,000
Just like that?

14
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
Alright.

15
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Where's Hedge?

16
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,100
You don't see him?
He's out the door.

17
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,800
- Is he?
- You're next Lenny.

18
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
They were soft on him, things 
will look good for you.

19
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,900
It's not likely they're going to split up such 
a formiddable partnership, now is it?

20
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,900
Drake!

21
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,200
Get your fucking hands off me!

22
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,600
Hedges!

23
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Catwalk!

24
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,000
Hello, brother.

25
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,800
Come on, let's get them.
- You smoked.

26
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Give me one. Come on.
You have them all.

27
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,300
Someone takes care of you.
- Of course not.

28
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,700
Are you sure?
- Yes, I want one of them pussies.

29
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,200
Come on, come on.
Give me one.

30
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,700
Pussies!

31
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,100
Hey, you!
Look good to me!

32
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
The next time I see you
stand with your face against the wall!

33
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
- Against the wall, yeah!
- You bet.

34
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,400
Pussies! Pussies! Pussies!

35
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,800
Pussies! Pussies! Pussies!

36
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,300
This is your cell. This is your bunk.
This is your cellmate.

37
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,800
James Lacey.

38
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,100
Perry, mail.

39
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,700

Frank Perry
Prisoner Number 23401

41
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,000
Stare at someone else.

<i>Prisoner 135 Batista, absent from Cell </ i></i>

48
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
You come at the wrong time,
chapel is closed.

49
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,500
Perry!

50
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,000
Well...

51
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,400
It's been a wee while.

52
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,700
I'll be right outside.

53
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,400
This is very hard.

54
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
But...

55
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I'v got something I have to say to her.

56
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It's nearly time, Batista.

57
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,900
Book!

58
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,600
Book.

59
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Magazine.

60
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Give me a card.

61
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,200
Come on, I want a card, Batista.

62
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,200
Just give me one.

63
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,400
Just give it to me!

64
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,700
Go beg your brother.

65
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,300
Do you get to wait awhile.

66
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,300
He's getting cocky, Rizzi! he's laughing
at me! You know he does it, you know he fucking does it!

67
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Get out.
You heard me, now get out.

68
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,300
Batista!

69
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,300
Come with me.

70
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Your choice.

71
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Tony said it was...

72
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,400
Tony...

73
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
Checkmate.

74
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
That's the first time in 11 years.

75
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Another game Frank?

76
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,900
Lacey, have a wonder.

77
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,500
- I'm not really in the mood.
- Have a wonder.

78
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Hey kid.

79
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,900
Five minutes.

80
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,400
What?

81
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,400
The air vents in the laundry.

82
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Would they connect to a sewer?

83
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,600
- Come again?
- The back of the dryer's.

84
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,800
Would they connect to the sewer system?

85
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,500
Frank, what's going on?

86
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,800
My first letter in 14 years.

87
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,300
Telling me our little girl's
a junkie.

88
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,500
Her heart stopped twice.

89
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,000
- She's a... she's not comin'...
- No.

90
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,500
Before it happens again...

91
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
I gotta see her.

92
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,200
- I gotta make things right.
- Frank!

93
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,000
I want out, Brodie.

94
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Not in a month,
not six.

95
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,600
Now.

96
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,600
- The air vents in the laundry, do they connect?
- Frank, your not thinking straight...

97
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,000
Does it connect?
I'm not asking again.

98
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,400
Yeah.

99
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,000
But the air vent, it'll be capped.
You won't go through solid steel.

100
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,100
- Lenny Drake can.
- Lenny Drake? his walking in a few.

101
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,800
His parole's been revoked.
Hedge's grassing him for early release.

102
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,300
Suppose you get past the door cap,

103
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,000
the vent'll only take us as far as the perimeter.
as soon as your there you'll be picked up.

104
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,400
That's why I'll go deeper.

105
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,700
- No, I'm not going back down there.
- I'm telling you, you don't have to.

106
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Jesus, Frank. You know why I'm in this dump.
- Would you listen?

107
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,200
- I want you to tell me, not take me.
- I can't tell you.

108
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,500
Fuck.

109
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,000
I can't even even draw you a map.

110
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,900
Is your mind made up?

111
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,800
Frank!

112
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Without me, you'll be lost in minutes.

113
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Stare at someone else.

114
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,900
- I'm not in the mood for a chat today.
- I can understand that.

115
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,400
Cunt snitched me out.

116
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,400
Well I tell ya, nobody was
more surprised than I was.

117
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,000
He walks early and I 
go out for Gomez?

118
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,600
So I murdered a guard,
Hedge's... Fucker was holding him down.

119
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,300
When walk out that door...

120
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,600
Suppose I could get you 
out the door, with me?

121
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,300
Don't fuck with me, Perry!
I told you I'm not in the mood.

122
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,100
What would you prefer to smack? that
bit of leather, or your number two?

123
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,100
Smack?

124
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,200
I had something more brutal in mind.

125
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,500
You walk through walls, Lenny.
and that's useful.

126
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,600
Is it?

127
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,100
Say we talk...
and you're not interested,

128
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,400
Well it goes without saying
we never talked.

129
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,400
Yeah, goes without saying.

130
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Domino.

131
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,600
Three players.

132
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Alright. Barriers.

133
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,000
One.

134
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,600
Two.

135
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,700
Three.

136
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,100
- Locks?
- Bolt and key.

137
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
No chance.

138
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm a thief, not a magician.

139
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,400
- There is another way.
- How?

140
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,200
Shower drain.

141
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Directly above.

142
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,400
There's the same problem above.
And more barriers.

143
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,600
Only one. The chapel wall.

144
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,700
- It'll take all night.
- Ever considered confessing?

145
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Back of the confession room...
panels... loose.

146
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,700
And the chapel door?

147
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,500
What about the tools?

148
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
The Lord...

149
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,300
Provides.

150
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
Domino.

151
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,000
The first time we hit a tile,
screws'll come running.

152
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,600
- Alarm's would be louder.
- Who sets them of?

153
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,000
- We do, when they caught on to us missing.
- It's an obstacle course as it is.

154
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,600
If they're onto us from the off...

155
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,800
We'll be over the drains when the alarm goes
by the time they leave the spar...

156
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,700
- We'll be in the laundry.
- How long have you got before you're in the laundry?

157
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,000
Five minutes... tops.

158
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,300
That's enough.

159
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,000
Alright.

160
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,200
Next piece.
The dryer.

161
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,600
- Locks?
- Older than me.

162
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,800
What about the cap? on the vent.

163
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,100
You don't worry about that.

164
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,400
- I'll sort my end.
- Yeah, yeah I do worry.

165
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,400
Have you got something that cuts through steel?

166
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,800
I'v got whatever it takes.

167
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,500
Five minutes of your time.

168
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,400
I think I may have found 
you a challenge.

169
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,000
Domino.

170
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,300
From the minute we're inside,
you don't breathe, you don't talk.

171
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,300
That far underground, banter echo's.

172
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Ignore your thinking,
it'll only be playing tricks.

173
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,300
Things are different down there.

174
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,400
The laundry vent'll take us to here,
top of the sump.

175
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,700
Then we go deep.

176
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,800
There's a drainage tunnel.

177
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Now were gonna need to get through
that... after that,

178
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,700
as far, as the river.

179
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,300
- What river?
- We're south, remember?

180
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,200
I can't swim.

181
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,400
No? We go under it.

182
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,400
There's a reservoir under the embankment.

183
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,300
it connects to the rail network.

184
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,200
Once we're on the tracks,
All roads, lead to Rome.

185
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,500
Charing cross, that's where we surface.

186
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,500
- Why so far? There's got to be stations closer?
- Plenty of exits.

187
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,300
- Easy to disappear, if we head for rush hour.
- No, before rush hour.

188
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Track goes live at five.
630 Volts.

189
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,600
If we're not on the platform,
by then, we're tap-dancing.

190
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,700
How do you know all this?
How's he know all this?

191
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,300
Because I shovelled shit down there
for 12 years.

192
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Prosperous holiday for you then.

193
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,700
Ok. How much time?

194
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,700
The night bell rings about 9.
That gives us eight hours into the AM.

195
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,400
- When do we go?
- How much do you need?

196
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,800
Three days.

197
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,000
That's good for me.

198
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,900
On Friday...

199
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,100
we away.

200
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh, one more thing,

201
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,900
Just make sure you don't get
murdered that night.

202
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:53,500
There you go, proof that David 
and Goliath, is cock... and bullshit.

203
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,300
Wouldn't be to sure.

204
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,900
Did you drop something?

205
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,800
Didn't see you there.

206
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,700
No, you didn't.

207
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,400
Fancy yourself do you, Frank?

208
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,600
What?

209
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,900
You got permission?

210
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,500
You done.

211
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,100
Fuck.

212
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Fuck... that's not gonna make
Rizza happy.

213
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,500
The trouble is, if I open my
mouth,

214
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,700
he'd like to piss in yours.

215
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,500
I could sort somethimg out,
avoid any trouble.

216
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,800
What?

217
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,300
Time out, Frank.
With Len gone.

218
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,300
I can run faster.

219
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,500
To find out Rizza's gonna,
make sure you don't go anywhere.

220
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,300
Unless you sort me out.

221
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, that's right.

222
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,900
You won't get enough?

223
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,800
First bill tomorrow, Frank.

224
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,600
In your cell, Frank, yeah?

225
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,300
First bell.

226
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,300
Drop it!

227
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,300
Don't you do this, I will not let
you fuck this up!

228
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,700
'Fish and Chips " with salt and vinegar?
how about that?

229
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,400
You got to be looking forward to that.

230
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,500
Yeah?

231
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,700
Park bench in the sun...

232
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,300
A beautiful large portion
of... fresh battered cod,

233
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,200
wrapped in a newspaper.

234
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,100
Watching beautiful girls jog by...
You know what I mean?

235
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,700
No.

236
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,000
You alright?

237
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,700
What?

238
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,400
Tony.

239
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,600
- Fuck.
- What?

240
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,500
How the fuck, did he find out?

241
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,900
- What does he want?
- Half a key

242
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
- Half a fucking key? That's more than a little grounds worth.
- We've got options.

243
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,100
Yeah, I suggest the option,
that murders him.

244
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,100
And have Rizza on our backs.
Not a chance, Tony's untouchable.

245
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,800
Not, Tony, Batista. We get 
rid of him and pocket his stash.

246
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,500
Where do we look, under
his mattress? Check in his pockets?

247
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,600
The guy's got an operation going on,
don't you think his smarter than that.

248
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,300
Prick's not made of fucking, kryptonite!

249
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,400
Nobody's getting their hands 
bloody for Tony. Nobody!

250
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,300
- Are you killing him?
- No.

251
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,600
So?

252
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,300
What if...

253
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,400
A ticket out, is worth something to,
Batista?

254
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,400
Half a key?

255
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,500
- And you want me to give it to you?
- No.

256
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,100
It's a trade.

257
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Who else is going?

258
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,800
Brodie.

259
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,800
And Lenny Drake.

260
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,300
Lenny Drake?

261
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,400
Half a key of CAT,
cleans me out for a month.

262
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,400
Tony knows that.

263
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,400
So...
Tony's got a taste for it.

264
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,200
He think you kill me for it,
or steal it.

265
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,800
Which puts me in a coffin, or worse
if I don't deliver it for Rizza.

266
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,300
Besides...

267
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,800
If Tony knows, then Tony know's.

268
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,000
He's the devil on your back now.

269
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,900
But you will not trade,
I give out trade.

270
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,300
CAT's, are dangerous drug,
but deadly when poison.

271
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You get me?

272
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:08,100
If it looks,
smells and tastes like CAT's...

273
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,100
- Who will know?
- No one touches Tony.

274
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,500
- Rizza will...
- Rizza?

275
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,400
Who's gonna tell Rizza?

276
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,300
Junkies die, every day.

277
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,100
Alright.

278
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,200
That's a trade.

279
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,300
Shit.

280
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,500
Brodie, wait!

281
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,900
Brodie...

282
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,100
<i>Lights out. 

283
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,100
You smoke?

284
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,700
That was the last time I saw her.

285
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,800
She'll be 21 tomorrow.

286
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,700
# He took a knife and he cut her down. #

287
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:36,600
# And on her bosom, these lines he found #

288
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,300
# Oh, what a foolish girl #

289
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:49,500
# was I, to hang myself,
for a butcher's boy. #

290
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:55,400
# Go dig my grave,
both wide and deep. #

291
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,900
# Put a marble stone
at my head and feet #

292
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,500
# And on my grave... #

293
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:42,200
# ...I die for love. #

294
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,900
This is cozy.

295
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,200
You should wrap a blanket,
'round him, Frankie, he's cold.

296
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,900
- Give us a minute.
- No.

297
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,500
No, he stays.

298
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,700
I like his company.

299
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,700
Got something for me have you, Frank.

300
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,600
What's Sykes doin' here?

301
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,800
Call it a peace of mind.

302
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,600
How do I know, you'll keep
your mouth shut up?

303
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,000
- Your lucky your still fucking standing.
- I need a guarantee.

304
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,600
- Anymore?
- It is trade.

305
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,700
I want a guarantee that you'll keep your mouth
shut, otherwise there is no deal.

306
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:04,200
You don't, make rules.

307
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,300
Yeah.

308
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,100
Have a burn.

309
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,700
Rizza! Ri... Ri...

310
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,100
Rizza!

311
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:37,200
It's okay kid... it's okay.
It's okay.

312
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,700
Open the door's.

313
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,400
<i>Do it, Perry! Now 

314
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,400
Frank...

315
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
Frank.

316
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,200
- I see something.
- What?

317
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,900
Well he came out of nowhere.

318
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,000
wh... you couldn't do a thing?

319
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,500
- Well he's a walking corpse now.
- We all are.

320
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,400
Why?
Little kid did the job for us.

321
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,100
As soon as he finds Sykes,
Rizza will hit wind, with the palm.

322
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,000
Rizza's upwind.

323
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,300
The only thing he knows,
is that Tony took a fall.

324
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,900
And Lacey?
What happens to him now?

325
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,100
He will not be in the hole for long.

326
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,000
Rizza, will make sure of that.

327
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,800
Will he hump the Rizza?

328
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:03,100
Which weigh's more, Frank?
a tonne of bricks...

329
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,400
or a ton of feathers?

330
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
He is a dead man,
with or without us, Frank.

331
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:22,200
So we leave tomorrow,
as planned.

332
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,600
- Where are you going?
- It's been awhile, since my last confession.

333
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,700
Listen... leave it.

334
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,800
Follow him!

335
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:24,200
Let's move, we've got one hour
before the tracks go live.

336
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,300
Listen!

337
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,500
- They've found us!
- Let's move!

338
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,300
Keep running!

339
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,700
Hello, Frank.

340
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,600
Hello, Rizza.

341
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,700
- I was sorry about your brother.
- Why's that? Did you kill him?

342
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,800
- Well, I had no reason.
- Well, there's always reason's.

343
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,800
He was a junkie,
a cunt, nobody liked him.

344
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:18,700
I don't smoke, Frank. I don't
like smoke around me.

345
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,300
You got family, Frank?

346
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,500
Yeah.

347
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,000
Any young?

348
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,800
Aww, she's a gorgeous one.

349
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,500
Do you love her?

350
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,500
Family is important.

351
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,500
But the only important thing.

352
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,600
So I'll only ask once.

353
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,200
I won't ask again.

354
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,700
He was talking to the lad.

355
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,200
He had a thing for him.

356
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,200
Tony, was over by the doorway...

357
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,700
Making moves on him.

358
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,300
Sykes...

359
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,300
Pulled him from the doorway.

360
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,100
I heard them Arguing...
Fighting.

361
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,000
After a minute.

362
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:40,100
There whole, spur was quiet.

363
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,000
You don't have much...

364
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,800
- yet you just subtracted, from what's left.
- Rizza...

365
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,200
You lie to me one more time...

366
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,400
They're bringing your boy out tonight.

367
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,400
I want him in my cell, before 
closing time. You bring him.

368
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,500
You got one thing kind for you, Frank.

369
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,800
You're too old, to die young.

370
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,200
- You alright?
- No.

371
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,500
He's alright.

372
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,300
Stay with us, Frank!

373
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,100
Are you ready?

374
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,400
Perry?

375
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,900
Batista, Mitra,
Parkhurst.

376
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,700
Visiting room.

377
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,700
Wait... Frank.

378
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,300
Let's move.
Before these tracks go live.

379
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,400
Frank!

380
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,100
Frank, move now!

381
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,400
Help me.

382
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,500
Go, go, go!

383
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,400
Go!

384
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,500
Hurry!

385
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,800
Sit down.

386
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,700
Where you from, lad?

387
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,900
London.

388
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,300
- Old Street.
- Old Street?

389
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,300
I can't remember my street.

390
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,600
Rizza's, waiting for you, in his cell.

391
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,700
Want's me to take you there.

392
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,400
Go to the chapel, lad,

393
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,200
Before the end bell.

394
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:48,900
And make your confession.
Give this to Brodie.

395
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:53,700
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

396
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,400
Why me, Frank.

397
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,700
You remind me of someone.

398
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,700
<i>Five minutes. 

399
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,300
Where is he?

400
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,700
You know...

401
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:40,400
I must have read this book,
about a dozen times.

402
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:53,700
If I had my time again, and I could
start over like, Rereading this book.

403
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,750
It'd be someone, I'd sit down
and talk to.

404
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:03,000
I'd talk some sense into him, tell him
how things really are.

405
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,300
But I can't.

406
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,600
That man's long gone,

407
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,100
and I'm all that's left.

408
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:23,200
- Where is he?
- But do you know something?

409
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,300
I'm free now.

410
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,300
- Like my little girl.
- Free?

411
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,700
- You've got an imagination.
- Imagination's what protects us.

412
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,900
It's what keeps us alive.

413
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,200
But, your still living,
but less and less.

414
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:49,100
Inside, you own this place.

415
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,200
You run things,

416
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,200
you're the king,
but look around you, what do you see?

417
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,800
It's all prepared.

418
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,600
It's all made up.

419
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,700
You own nothing.

420
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:10,500
Nothing except cells, bars
and a rusty metal staircase.

421
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:19,300
You'll never live... because outside,
you don't exist.

422
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:28,600
- No one will remember you.
- You, behave yourself.

423
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:35,200
Behaving myself, it's what's
kept me living this long.

424
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,300
- You tell me where he is.
- Lacey?

425
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,800
He'll be alright.

426
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:58,200
- He's gone, Rizza.
- What did you say?

427
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,000
Gone.

428
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,600
Where's Frank?

429
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,900
The lad's free.

430
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,700
Don't you walk away from me!

431
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,400
It's like you said

432
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,600
I'm too old...

433
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,400
Alarm!

434
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,400
Frank...

435
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,900
Frank!

436
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,100
I got no air.

437
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,700
Brodie...

438
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,100
Frank.

439
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,400
- Frank.
- Frank!

440
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,000
There's no air.

441
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,500
I can't breathe.

442
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,600
...can't breathe.

443
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,200
You stay with us, Frank

444
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:44,500
- Stay with us!
- Come on, Frank!

445
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,900
Come on, Frank.
Come on.

446
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,200
We are Free

447
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:00,200
