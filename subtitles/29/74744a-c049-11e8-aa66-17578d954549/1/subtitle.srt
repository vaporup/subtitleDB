1
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,168
Calm down, Miss.

2
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,466
I want to see him.

3
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,771
Where's he?

4
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,702
Mr. Hung is on his way.

5
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,403
Please calm down.

6
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,410
I want him here right away.

7
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,677
There she is, Mr. Hung.

8
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,783
Susan

9
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,488
Tiger!

10
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,651
What are you doing?

11
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,193
Is this a threat?

12
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,421
No.

13
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,157
I'm just hurt!

14
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,425
You know I'm called The Heartbreaker.

15
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,296
This was bound to happen.

16
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,130
What did you expect?

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,595
Don't hurt me.

18
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,738
Forget it. Where's the negotiator?

19
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,434
She's over there.

20
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,279
Susan!

21
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,678
Tiger...

22
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:55,806
She talked to the stewardess,

23
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,407
and learned you were dating her.

24
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,475
I think she's also your girlfriend.

25
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,579
What should I do? Who's in charge?

26
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:03,714
Over there.

27
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,491
Susan!

28
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,761
Tiger...

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,559
I thinks she's also your girlfriend.

30
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,896
3 people trying to kill themselves.
Where's the fire chief?

31
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:14,691
There.

32
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,862
Tiger.

33
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:19,834
Susan...

34
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,663
I think...

35
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,402
You're right. She's also my girlfriend.

36
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,568
What should we do?

37
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:29,139
- Tiger...
- Tiger...

38
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,906
Quiet!

39
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,446
Quiet!

40
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,156
Let me think.

41
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:42,853
Miss.

42
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,199
You seem to be
the only rational girl here.

43
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,134
Any advise?

44
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,932
Are you hitting on me?

45
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,266
Pretty girl, you're smart!

46
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,100
You dated me already.

47
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,645
I did? When?

48
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,771
When I was 16.

49
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,679
You dumped me after 7 days.

50
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,513
You know how hurt I was?

51
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,745
You're...

52
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,081
Susan!

53
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,588
Did you take it well?

54
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,057
No.

55
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:15,755
I slashed my wrist and
overdosed on sleeping pills.

56
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,961
What are you doing?

57
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,093
Getting a tan.

58
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,067
Getting a tan?

59
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,798
Can't you see what's going on here?

60
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,930
What's your name?

61
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:26,734
- Susan
- What?

62
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,172
Susan!

63
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,138
You...

64
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,701
What's your number?

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,500
99172717

66
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,912
What kind of sunscreen do you use?

67
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,144
Nivia.

68
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,708
Try Lancome.

69
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,817
This place is a mess.

70
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,322
You should come to my house.

71
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,184
- I got a tanning bed.
- Where's your place?

72
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,022
You can do anything you want there.

73
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,983
Hi doc.

74
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,849
Still the same?

75
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,088
Can't believe
what those girls did to my body.

76
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,921
I'm over-exhausted.

77
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,221
Nothing to do with them.

78
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,128
It's because you party too much.

79
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,358
Your body is worn out.

80
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,089
You have to help me.

81
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,794
I've done everything I can.

82
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,268
Try Chinese doctor.

83
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,602
I did. They told me
Western medicine would help.

84
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,238
Then we have to try something extreme.

85
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,241
How extreme?

86
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,006
There are 3 places in this world
that can cure you.

87
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,046
Which 3?

88
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,877
One is Shaolin, the other is Wudan.

89
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,314
But they won't help people like you.

90
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,646
Why?

91
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,618
You're guilty of lust.

92
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,254
What's the third place?

93
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,019
This place was very well respected
in the past.

94
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,322
But today it's lost its influence

95
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:58,024
and forgotten by most people...

96
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,700
What's the name?

97
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,235
Think!

98
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,668
Omei!

99
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,055
Isn't Omei sect all women?

100
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,719
They're your employees in China.

101
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,160
Mr. Hung?

102
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,921
Mr. Hung?

103
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,062
Mr. Hung?

104
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,933
Where's Omei's representative?

105
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,865
Mr. Hung?

106
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,939
Get her.

107
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,347
Over here.

108
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,311
Tiger Hung is known as
The Heartbreaker.

109
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,186
He has to be good-looking.

110
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,782
Don't bother to ask the ugly people.

111
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,293
What's your name?

112
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,259
May.

113
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,263
Which one of you is Mr. Hung?

114
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,331
Come!

115
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,799
Here!

116
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,096
Wise up!

117
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,894
Can't believe we have to walk.

118
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,938
How far are we from the top?

119
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,007
Almost there.

120
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,973
No way. Who will it be?

121
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,948
What?

122
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,178
Who will carry me?

123
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,377
Hurry.

124
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,016
Lower.

125
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,196
What's that?

126
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,096
Cable car.

127
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,099
Where is it going?

128
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,468
Top of the mountain.

129
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,933
Why aren't we on it?

130
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,999
It's expensive. 80 dollars per head.

131
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,475
That's 400 dollars for all of us.

132
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,911
It's just a few more steps.

133
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,446
A few more steps?

134
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,062
Shit! More stairs?

135
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,402
This is a mountain.

136
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,302
Shit!

137
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,909
Forget it.

138
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,213
Go get your Master.

139
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,413
I am the Master.

140
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,388
You?

141
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,017
I'm the temp.
Something happened here.

142
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,527
What? Everyone is dead?

143
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,620
Mr. Hung,
please promise me one thing.

144
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,627
Don't hit on my sisters.

145
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,595
We're simple people.

146
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,993
I can get girls anywhere.

147
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,300
Why would I come this far to do it?

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,338
A promise is a promise.

149
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,539
All clear!

150
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,113
All clear!

151
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,086
What happened to your face?

152
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,024
3rd Sister told me

153
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,393
this would keep us safe.

154
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,993
Shit! I'm not interested
in mountain people.

155
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,969
So are my men.

156
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,266
Of course...

157
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,670
Thanks for the assurance.

158
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,240
I'll show you your room.

159
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,139
Prepare dinner for him.

160
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,907
Yes.

161
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,609
What's wrong with him?

162
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,483
How can he compare us
to mountain people?

163
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,954
The one in yellow shirt is pretty.

164
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,324
The one behind the tree

165
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,329
is very cute.

166
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,489
Fourth Sister is the best.

167
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,396
Third Sister is better.

168
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,297
She's mine.

169
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,599
Forget it. Boss already set his eyes
on both of them.

170
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,229
Didn't you notice?

171
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,934
You can forget about the other girls.

172
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,569
Boss will take them all.

173
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,413
We won't have a chance.

174
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,716
This way.

175
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,282
You'll stay here until you're cured.

176
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,954
Shit!

177
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,426
Shit!

178
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,331
Enjoy.

179
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,373
Shit!

180
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,171
Shit!

181
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,511
Shit!

182
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,140
Shit!

183
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,984
Shit!

184
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,382
Like the food?

185
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,546
Shit!

186
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,385
Shit!

187
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,687
What does "shit" mean?

188
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,195
It means Omei is a bunch of crap!

189
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,666
Good thing I asked.

190
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,565
It'll improve my English.

191
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:17,632
May.

192
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:21,043
What does "shit" mean?

193
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,514
It means Omei is a bunch of crap.

194
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,413
What?

195
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,179
May, you've got good temper.

196
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:29,188
If Big Sister returns, they'll be dead.

197
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,187
If Big Sister returns, we'll all be dead.

198
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,060
Keep practicing your sword.

199
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,655
Eat more.

200
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:41,360
Keep practicing.

201
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,503
Put your clothes on.

202
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,268
Put your clothes on.

203
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,137
What's wrong?

204
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,176
Let's go!

205
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,107
We're leaving.

206
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,139
What's wrong, boss?

207
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,582
This place is a fraud.

208
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,515
I don't want some quack doctor
killing me.

209
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,111
The cable car has stopped running.

210
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,247
I don't care. I'm leaving!

211
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,223
I got cash. I'll find a way. Let's go!

212
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,619
I got money!

213
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,462
Start the cable car!

214
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,369
I got money!

215
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,809
So what? Leave or I'll let the dogs out!

216
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,836
Let's go, boss.

217
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,512
It's freezing.

218
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,243
No! We'll walk.

219
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,409
Who will it be?

220
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,077
Who will it be?

221
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,520
Boss!

222
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,821
Hurry.

223
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,156
Where are you going?

224
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,361
Boss, it's just one night.

225
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,607
At least we have a place to stay.

226
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,437
Omei is a fraud!

227
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,111
Put me down!

228
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,879
Boss...

229
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,275
Put me down!

230
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,896
Incredible.

231
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,264
It's not like they can fly.

232
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,366
Boss.

233
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,620
Isn't that amazing?

234
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,220
Let's go back first.

235
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,404
We don't see it.

236
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,947
There isn't any.

237
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,441
But I saw it in my dream.

238
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,849
They used wireworks.

239
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,444
They must've took it down already.

240
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,422
Let's try her.

241
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,932
Easy on the lady.

242
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,567
Don't hurt her face.

243
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,408
Sisters!

244
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,010
Sisters!

245
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,478
Why are you here?

246
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,783
What is it?

247
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,289
They snuck up on me.

248
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,883
May!

249
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,665
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,344
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,342
We're losing the fat one!

253
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,452
You two must train harder.

254
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,090
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

255
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,354
What?

256
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,723
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,564
You should never play around
like this again.

258
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,699
Boss, Omei is for real!

259
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,106
Your kidney is fine.

260
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,873
No internal injury.

261
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,885
Show me your tongue.

262
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:07,956
What's wrong with you?

263
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,461
You're in really bad shape.

264
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,091
You're better off dead.

265
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,730
Are you serious?

266
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,529
Heart.

267
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,497
Liver.

268
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,940
Spleen.

269
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,602
Lung.

270
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,145
Kidney.

271
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,610
This tree can cure me?

272
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,914
It has precious herbal essence.

273
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,979
It's over 500 years old.

274
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:40,490
This tree reminds me of a girl.

275
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,688
She had legs bigger than the tree trunk.

276
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,697
Another girl had great legs,

277
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,495
but her skin felt like tree bark.

278
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,033
Ants!

279
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,438
A big nest!

280
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,476
You're in luck!

281
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,603
Omei ants are a great cure!

282
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,045
They're in my pants!

283
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,013
They're moving upward.

284
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,982
Let them be.

285
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,177
They bit me!

286
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,944
Let them be.

287
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,683
They're in my crotch.

288
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,487
They're healing you. Let them be.

289
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,202
That's a lot of needles.
I'm like a hedgehog.

290
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,672
More needles give better result.

291
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,779
I knew a girl
who had a hedgehog hairstyle.

292
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,215
It made her look like a pig.

293
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,578
It was ugly!

294
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,554
But she had a great body.

295
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,988
So I made my move.

296
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,855
But her face kept getting in the way.

297
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,520
When I was with her,
I always had the urge

298
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,156
to cover her face with a pillow case.

299
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,725
It hurts.

300
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,237
The next batch of needles will hurt.

301
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,769
Acupuncture shouldn't hurt.

302
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,137
Omei style is different.

303
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,472
It'll give faster result.

304
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,777
It hurts!

305
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,577
Ouch!

306
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,587
Don't look under Grand Master's skirt!

307
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,284
I can't control the urge.

308
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,016
I just want to see what's underneath it.

309
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,959
Once when I saw a guy wearing a kilt,

310
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,657
I almost did the same thing.

311
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,165
You're really sick.

312
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,829
You don't have to cure this disease.

313
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,199
What's for today?

314
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,965
I'll teach you Revitalization Exercise.

315
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,030
Revitalization?

316
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,131
Perfect!

317
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,337
Can't follow?

318
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,236
Can't even see it.

319
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,041
I know something simpler,
but its 20% less effective.

320
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,070
Better than nothing!

321
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,308
Kneel down.

322
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,353
Slap yourself.

323
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,112
Slap here.

324
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,748
And here.

325
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,391
Do I start with the left hand?

326
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,289
Doesn't matter, just don't miss your face.

327
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,626
When do I stop?

328
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,724
Until your face is swollen.

329
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,234
But I'll look ugly.

330
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,361
Want to try the harder exercise?

331
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,698
I'll never be able to learn that.

332
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,841
Grand Mater must've been a pretty girl.

333
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,010
She looks like a 36G.

334
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,049
Hit your mouth.

335
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,987
It's equally effective.

336
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,116
How will I talk?

337
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,819
You'll find ways.

338
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,734
I had this really hot girlfriend.

339
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,293
She had a 42G body,

340
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,066
but got short legs.

341
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,971
The other one was just the opposite.

342
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,235
She had long legs,

343
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,038
but small breast.

344
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:55,239
Would be great to see her again.

345
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,676
Forgot to slap myself.

346
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,116
A few more slaps.

347
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,948
It's painful.

348
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,049
It hurts!

349
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,026
Have you found it?

350
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,260
I can't pee...

351
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,360
Found it.

352
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,271
This will release your bladder
right away.

353
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,437
I remember this other girlfriend.

354
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,945
- How fast did you say?
- Right away.

355
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,453
You can't out-run it.

356
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,253
Don't be embarrassed, you're ill.

357
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:49,265
This is humiliating.

358
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,700
I remember this other girlfriend.

359
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:56,241
She would wet herself when she cries.

360
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,298
Am I...

361
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,343
I found another cure!

362
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:00,504
What is it?

363
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,804
It cures constipation.

364
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,932
This day had to come.

365
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,100
Big Sister has lost it.

366
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,438
There's only 23 of us,

367
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,308
but she left 29 hand prints.

368
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,438
Ones on the right are us.

369
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:38,279
Ones on the left are our patients.

370
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,012
And the one on top?

371
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,453
That's Big Sister herself.

372
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,388
She plans to die together with us.

373
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,423
How about the footprint?

374
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,490
That's how she flew up there.

375
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:56,159
Big Sister is wearing Nike.

376
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,964
The other one is Adidas.

377
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,236
She must've found them at junk yard.

378
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,039
Big Sister is down in luck.

379
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,037
Why would a Omei Master

380
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,049
Iose her mind over a man?

381
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,483
Master, emergency!

382
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,545
Emergency!

383
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,087
I'm in pain.

384
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,495
Am I poisoned?

385
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,466
Go get their luggage.

386
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,594
What for?

387
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,101
Omei is in trouble.
No time to play with you.

388
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,538
I'll cure you now.

389
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,023
Boss!

390
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,132
Omei Needle!

391
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,226
Stay back!

392
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:17,015
Boss.

393
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:17,879
How do you feel?

394
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,179
One dosage a day. You'll be fine.

395
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:21,912
Go now.

396
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,113
Can I ask you something?

397
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,055
Sure.

398
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,158
What were you doing to me before?

399
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,023
Nothing.

400
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,063
They were just pranks

401
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,928
to make you pay for
what you did to women.

402
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,131
Screw you!

403
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,471
Forget it.

404
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,032
She saved your life.

405
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,635
See how you've recovered?

406
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,446
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

407
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,647
How should I cook the medicine?

408
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,187
You have to tell me!

409
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,419
Use 3 cups of water.

410
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,659
How long do I cook it?

411
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,956
Until there's one cup of water left!

412
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,123
Thanks!

413
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,128
Don't mention it.

414
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:32,913
It's windy.

415
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,084
Let's go in.

416
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,660
Big Sister is here. Attack formation!

417
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,743
It's raining. Let's go in.

418
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,012
Don't!

419
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,486
Big Sister...

420
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,287
Don't call me that.

421
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,692
When Grand Master expelled me
from Omei,

422
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,424
I took an oath

423
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,331
to die together with Omei.

424
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,231
Today is Master's funeral anniversary.

425
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,099
We'll all die together.

426
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,238
I'm kill myself first.

427
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,672
Then I'll kill you one by one.

428
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,272
Don't, Big Sister.

429
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,281
Scared? When Master expelled me...

430
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,646
She never expelled you.

431
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:07,151
It was you who expelled her.

432
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,114
Why did I do that?

433
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,418
Master gave up her position.

434
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,549
You became the new Master.

435
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,116
Me?

436
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,526
You still are today.

437
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,064
I'm just the temp.

438
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,726
Why did I expel the Master?

439
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,270
You fell in love with a womanizer.

440
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,737
He broke your heart.

441
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,139
Master tried to comfort you.

442
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,200
But you couldn't let go.

443
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,075
You felt ashamed for
being a Omei disciple.

444
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,137
Then you lost your mind.

445
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,547
You told Master to leave.

446
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,517
When Master took you
to see a psychiatrist,

447
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,247
you expelled her from Omei.

448
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,845
How did the Master die?

449
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,319
She was 120 years old.

450
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,055
I killed her...

451
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,597
She died of natural cause.

452
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:54,690
Will you listen to me?

453
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,796
I've killed the Master.

454
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,275
I'll continue my killing spree.

455
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,276
Then I'll kill myself.

456
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,788
Heartbreak Sword Technique is
the only way to beat me.

457
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,152
Heartbreak Sword Technique!

458
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,156
"One Night Stand"!

459
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:25,430
Too slow!

460
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,856
"Bitter Argument"!

461
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,868
No power! No real emotion!

462
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:35,801
"Mixed Emotion"!

463
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,169
You call this "Mixed Emotion"?

464
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,806
Have you ever been in love?

465
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,676
"Deep Sorrow"!

466
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:49,551
Heartbreak Sword Technique...

467
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,522
...requires true heartache.

468
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:56,491
I'll show you how it's done!

469
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,379
Why am I here?

470
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,281
You came to kill us.

471
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,690
My condition is getting worse.

472
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,489
You should seek help.

473
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,721
Quiet!

474
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,297
Who knows how long
I'll stay conscious?

475
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,560
Omei disciple May!

476
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,500
As Omei's 28th Master,

477
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,597
I order you to perfect
Heartbreak Sword Technique

478
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,303
and to become the new Master.

479
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:48,505
You have to stop me
or Omei will perish.

480
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:52,910
You never know what I'll do.

481
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,585
What are you doing?

482
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,179
I'll show you how Heartbreak
Sword Technique is done!

483
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,951
You're not worth my time.

484
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,595
I'll give you one month to practice.

485
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,956
When I return I'll finish the job!

486
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,791
You'll all be my victims!

487
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,464
Scared?

488
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,672
What is "One Night Stand"?

489
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,674
What is "Mixed Emotions"?

490
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,276
"What is "Deep Sorrow"?

491
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,819
If the first 7 moves are associated
with heartache,

492
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,414
why is the last move called
"Eternal Harmony"?

493
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:39,993
Why is the Grand Master smiling?

494
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,468
What makes her smile?

495
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,366
Why is love so deep?

496
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,441
Love can't be studied.

497
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,012
Love needs to be experienced.

498
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,269
Big Sister was right.

499
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,406
You need to experience heartache

500
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,041
to perfect your training.

501
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,844
Practice only perfect your form,
but there's no soul.

502
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,511
I know.

503
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,250
I'll do anything.

504
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,792
But time is running out.

505
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,054
Where do I find someone

506
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,285
to fall in love with
and to break my heart?

507
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,330
Don't worry.

508
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,389
You have 3 options.

509
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,694
One is Leonard Dicaprio

510
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:16,757
One is Takuya Kimura.

511
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,598
But they can't help you.

512
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,659
Why?

513
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,262
You don't speak their language.

514
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,466
And they can't speak Chinese.

515
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,735
What's my third option?

516
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,348
The love we have is precious.

517
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,784
May it last 1 billion light years.

518
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:48,630
The love we have is precious.

519
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,694
May it last 1 billion light years.

520
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,606
Doesn't light year measure distance?

521
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,309
Whatever.

522
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,564
Give me!

523
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,605
Tiger gave me this.

524
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:29,969
Tiger is mine!

525
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,010
Tiger is mine!

526
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:39,344
May, Tiger is your only option.

527
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:15,009
Boss, look who's here.

528
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,418
Make way.

529
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,685
You look busy. I'll come tomorrow.

530
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,661
I'm like this every day.

531
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,129
Entertain the girls.

532
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,601
Cutie!

533
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:31,931
It's a beach party!

534
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:32,971
Understood.

535
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,438
Came to see me?

536
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,110
What did you do to your hair?

537
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,148
You're wearing a skirt?

538
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,885
Are you called The Heartbreaker?

539
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,108
What did you tell them?

540
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,650
Something cruel and mean.

541
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,151
What is it?

542
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,818
They're all different.

543
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,152
Every relationship has its taboo.

544
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:28,557
I'm here asking you for a favor.

545
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,491
How dare you!

546
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,121
After what your "therapy" did to me?

547
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,126
I know you want to get even with me.

548
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,066
But this is serious.

549
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:38,932
Just kidding.

550
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,097
It's already behind me.

551
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,663
You're my savior.

552
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,904
This beach party wouldn't exist
without your help.

553
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,468
So what's so serious?

554
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:49,173
You know, I'm the temporary Master.

555
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,909
My Big Sister Misery...

556
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,575
No problem. Understood.

557
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,879
You do?

558
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:54,919
The name Misery means

559
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,079
she's heartbroken.

560
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,678
She's probably a kung fu master.

561
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,656
You're obviously not her match.

562
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,190
As the temporary Master,

563
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,593
You must beat Misery to protect Omei.

564
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:09,029
Omei must have a way to stop Misery.

565
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:11,759
But it isn't easy to learn.

566
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:12,929
Must be something unusual.

567
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,870
What am I good at?

568
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,567
I only know how to break girl's heart.

569
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,837
I've seen your Grand Master's statue.

570
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,810
She looked graceful.

571
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,972
She was holding a sword in her hand.

572
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,175
So it must be a sword technique.

573
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,219
Therefore, you want me to hurt you,

574
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:32,519
to perfect Heartbreak Sword Technique!

575
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,191
Will you help me?

576
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,021
Got a place to stay?

577
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,061
- Not yet.
- Come.

578
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,670
Before breaking my heart,
will you date me?

579
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:54,803
Sure.

580
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,580
But I can't hold hand.

581
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,108
No problem.

582
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,618
No embrace, no kissing.

583
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,211
No problem.

584
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,221
I can't sleep with you.

585
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,191
Of course not.

586
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,053
You can still break my heart?

587
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:10,958
Sure.

588
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,732
You're really incredible!

589
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:31,010
Awful.

590
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:32,945
What is this?

591
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,713
This is unacceptable.

592
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:37,652
Let's go.

593
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,190
Do you know who she is?

594
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,020
She's my savior!

595
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,593
Damn!

596
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,092
Let's go.

597
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,151
This room is awful.

598
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,596
No... It's great.

599
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,699
Thank you.

600
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,830
This is for you two.

601
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,038
I'm sorry.

602
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,633
This is all my fault.

603
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,904
I'm no good!

604
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,172
Don't' say that.

605
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,806
I appreciate everything you did.

606
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,816
I am helping you

607
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,182
for a selfish reason.

608
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,746
The first night at Omei,

609
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,222
when I saw you flying in the air,

610
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,782
I fell in love with you.

611
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,323
Are you serious?

612
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,832
It was love at first sight.

613
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,402
Don't tease me.

614
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,369
I'm tired. I'm going to the bathroom.

615
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:29,194
When I first met you at Omei,

616
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:34,000
I dreamt of our reunion.

617
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:38,975
I can give up my fortune for you.

618
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:43,242
Just pay me 10K everyday.

619
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:48,514
Ever since leaving Omei,

620
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,951
I dreamt of seeing you again.

621
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:57,484
If you will marry me,

622
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:02,029
I will give you my mansion.

623
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:06,862
Long time no see

624
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:10,874
I love you forever,
why are you laughing at me?

625
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:14,139
Long time no see

626
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,806
I love me, you love me or not...

627
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:19,350
I love you. Do you love me?

628
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:24,150
I love you. Do you love me?

629
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,785
I don't understand English.

630
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,156
What does the last part mean?

631
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:32,353
I'll sing it again in Chinese.

632
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,305
Long time no see.

633
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:45,207
I love you forever, you...

634
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,304
Damn! It's midnight.

635
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,775
What's wrong?

636
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,145
- I'm going.
- You are?

637
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,808
If I don't get home by midnight,

638
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:55,079
My Ferrari will turn into a pumpkin.

639
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:55,983
You're leaving?

640
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:56,782
Bye.

641
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:08,997
I forgot something.

642
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,091
What?

643
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,104
Did you just kiss me?

644
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,037
You promised you wouldn't.

645
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,344
It'll hurt me more?

646
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:37,885
It's 4.

647
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,925
You're coming over? Why?

648
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,356
You miss me?

649
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:46,921
What do I think?

650
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,898
I don't know.

651
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,897
Do whatever you want. I'll wait.

652
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,314
Please leave me a message.

653
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,516
At around 5 this morning,

654
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,028
Police found a damaged Ferrari
at Hung Min Rd...

655
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,997
The driver could not be found.

656
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:23,227
According to the police,

657
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:27,499
The car belongs to millionaire
Tiger Hung, a.k.a. The Heartbreaker.

658
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,597
The incident is being investigated.

659
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:32,165
Police are trying to contact Mr. Hung.

660
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,138
Who are you?

661
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,578
I crashed my car.

662
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:44,019
Why are you hurt?

663
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,057
Your car looked fine.

664
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:50,494
That's why the car is expensive.

665
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:52,496
It protects itself, not the driver.

666
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,297
Just kidding. I'm okay.

667
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,395
See?

668
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:12,643
It's fake.

669
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,412
You can rub it off.

670
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,078
Try it.

671
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:19,317
See?

672
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21,687
Here?

673
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,694
That's real.

674
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,457
Does it hurt?

675
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,465
Did your heart ache?

676
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:32,195
Great! Love has struck you.

677
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,134
That fast!

678
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,604
You don't have much time
left for the duel.

679
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,765
How about what happened last night?

680
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,134
All real emotions.

681
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,369
I got you a credit card.

682
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,275
Go buy some nice clothes.

683
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,313
You need to look pretty.

684
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,369
Why?

685
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,439
I'm taking you to see my parents.

686
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,485
Is it necessary?

687
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,121
The more things we do,
the more it'll hurt.

688
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,691
My parents.

689
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:03,631
Misery.

690
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,793
Uncle, Auntie.

691
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,503
A beautiful girl.

692
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,801
We've never met Tiger's girlfriends.

693
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,701
We didn't prepare anything.

694
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,304
Here's your gift.

695
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,470
No.

696
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,241
It's okay, we're family.

697
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,077
You're such a darling.

698
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,411
I have a bracelet for you.

699
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,452
Take your time.

700
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,816
She's pretty.

701
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,153
You want to get her drunk?

702
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,120
70%?

703
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,350
80% drunk.

704
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,446
It's done.

705
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:30,551
May, let's drink.

706
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,469
Come on.

707
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:41,470
I can't drink, uncle.

708
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,063
It's okay.

709
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,506
Cheers.

710
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:46,607
Drink.

711
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:53,547
My turn.

712
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,176
Cheers.

713
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:01,352
Race 1 Northern Blaze.

714
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,087
Race 2 Tincan.

715
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,095
Race 3 Blonde Okie.

716
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,528
Race 4 Lightning High.

717
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,190
Fifty Grand on each race, thanks.

718
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,467
Enjoy.

719
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:12,162
- Let's eat.
- Drink!

720
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:15,263
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

721
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,871
- 82 LaFite
- Let's eat.

722
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:25,109
You have to try this.

723
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,841
Vintage Mow Tai. Cheers!

724
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,428
Cheers!

725
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:58,411
She said she can't drink...

726
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,882
But she finished everything!

727
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:02,649
I'm not scared.

728
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,529
Cheers!

729
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:49,562
Done! She's 80% drunk.

730
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,335
She said she can't drink...

731
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,306
She's really something.

732
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:00,202
She's a martial artist.

733
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,971
No wonder.

734
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:05,973
Are you okay?

735
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,812
Yes.

736
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,978
Thanks.

737
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:14,017
Leaving?

738
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,282
Yes.

739
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,884
Where's your parents?

740
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,588
You met them already.

741
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,698
How did I behave?

742
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,028
Did they like me?

743
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,928
You knocked them out.

744
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:25,935
That's great.

745
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:27,266
Where are we going?

746
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:28,771
Fei Ngo Mountain!

747
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,244
This is Fei Ngo Mountain?

748
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:35,438
Omei moutain is a sacred ground.

749
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,878
So is Fei Ngo Mountain.

750
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:38,916
They're sacred for different reasons.

751
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,006
Of course.

752
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,776
One is famous for martial arts,
the other for sightseeing.

753
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:53,022
Why are the cars moving funny?

754
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,767
It's difficult to explain.

755
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,773
Why don't I demonstrate?

756
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,910
First you lower the girl's seat.

757
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:15,978
Then the driver will climb over.

758
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:18,648
I want to go back to the hotel.

759
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:19,951
Sure!

760
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,510
I want to take a shower.

761
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,311
No need.

762
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:47,078
Come on!

763
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:51,982
Noodle?

764
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:53,546
I want to take a shower.

765
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,023
No need.

766
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:03,923
Lobster claw?

767
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,434
I want to take a shower.

768
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,698
Why is this lobster noodle here?

769
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,769
I saw you too busy betting horses to eat,

770
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:12,401
so I got you something.

771
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,347
I want to take a shower.

772
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,608
Go ahead.

773
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:35,657
It's delicious.

774
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,429
You want some?

775
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,969
You didn't have dinner either.

776
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,679
What's wrong?

777
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:37,788
I can't sleep with you.

778
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,028
Do you want me to hurt you?

779
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,031
You have to beat Misery.

780
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,027
I can't do it.

781
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:48,002
This is bad.

782
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,967
I'm at a loss.

783
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,975
I never hurt anyone
without sleeping with her.

784
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,035
I warned you before:

785
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,706
No kiss, no sleeping together.

786
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,875
And you promised!

787
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:03,045
Men always say yes.

788
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,215
What now?

789
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,187
Then...

790
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,053
Let's just get it over with.

791
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:14,630
No need to shower...

792
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,223
No!

793
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:17,967
What now?

794
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,468
We'll pretend we've done it.

795
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:20,663
How?

796
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,705
I'll show you.

797
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:22,830
How?

798
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:26,643
Here.

799
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,096
So?

800
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,764
You got it all wrong.

801
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,604
You're inexperienced.

802
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,610
I'll show you. Come...

803
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:03,637
Let's say I'm you.

804
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:07,547
First close your eyes.

805
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:11,019
Then gasp with great satisfaction.

806
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,920
Do it 4 or 5 times, then smile.

807
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:18,891
Slowly turn your head over

808
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:20,692
and look at your lover.

809
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:24,624
Got it?

810
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,061
You try it.

811
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,774
First close my eyes.

812
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:38,008
Then gasp with great satisfaction.

813
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:41,915
Do it 4 or 5 times.

814
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:45,854
Then smile.

815
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:48,821
Slowly turn my head over.

816
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,326
And look at my lover.

817
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,733
You ruined it!

818
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,926
It's like this after marriage.

819
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:03,230
But this is our first time.

820
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:08,272
The first time I'll hold you in my arms

821
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:10,807
and talk all night

822
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:13,247
until day breaks.

823
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:15,083
What do we talk about?

824
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:16,878
Just nonsense.

825
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:19,821
But women will remember it
the rest of their lives.

826
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,050
How about guys?

827
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,786
We forget after waking up.

828
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,693
Then don't go to sleep.

829
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,390
But I'll get hungry.

830
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,155
No problem. Here is...

831
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:30,131
Lobster noodle.

832
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:31,862
It's finished.

833
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:32,994
What about me?

834
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,265
I asked you, but you didn't reply.

835
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,897
It's okay.

836
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:39,668
I also have... fried noodle.

837
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,369
It tastes better with chili sauce.

838
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,101
Got it!

839
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:46,705
How is it done?

840
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,184
The first night we would feed each other.

841
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,118
The second night we'll fight for the food.

842
00:54:53,224 --> 00:54:54,953
Feed me first!

843
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:57,953
Here you go.

844
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:40,064
When I first met you at Omei...

845
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,369
Tiger, I bought you many things.

846
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:48,810
Shirts, pants, shoes, and socks.

847
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:49,470
Are you happy?

848
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,044
I'm in a great mood.

849
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:52,480
- Really?
- Also...

850
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,241
I bought you underwear.

851
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,014
First love is like this.

852
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,460
Calling Fatty, subject is coming down.

853
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,759
Calling boss,
subject is heading your way.

854
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,337
What are you doing?

855
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:17,067
What have I promised you?

856
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:18,335
That you'll help me.

857
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,240
To do what?

858
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,074
To perfect Heartbreak Sword Technique.

859
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:23,113
How?

860
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,807
By breaking my heart.

861
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,234
Where's she?

862
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,766
Find her!

863
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:27,970
Take the elevator!

864
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,887
What's wrong with you?

865
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:44,928
I'm scared?

866
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,087
Scared?

867
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,929
I'm scared of getting hurt.

868
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:50,091
Isn't that what you want?

869
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,859
How about not so fast?

870
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:54,234
I want the good times last longer.

871
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,294
You're running out of time!

872
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,533
Where's your dedication?

873
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:03,242
Say something!

874
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:04,611
I want to go back to the hotel.

875
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,372
No. You're coming to my place.

876
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,974
Why?

877
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:09,986
So I'll have you cornered!

878
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:15,089
Master!

879
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,525
Open up, May!

880
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:21,394
Don't you want to be heartbroken?

881
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:23,524
No... I'm scared.

882
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:24,434
Damn!

883
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,365
Where's the key?

884
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:27,404
- Here.
- Hurry!

885
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:14,906
Get her!

886
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,884
Don't go anywhere.

887
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:30,367
Stop her, Ben!

888
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,344
Where's she?

889
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:25,252
What's wrong?

890
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:27,153
Something got into my eyes.

891
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:28,452
Go wash them.

892
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:36,125
It's dusty down there.

893
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,163
You think I don't know?

894
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,335
Stop running around.

895
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,236
I won't next time.
I'm not feeling any pain.

896
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,740
Actually I think it's funny.

897
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,033
Why?

898
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,407
You don't know how to hurt me.

899
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,469
What do you mean? Where's the girl?

900
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:50,012
You all right?

901
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,207
She's having an asthma attack.

902
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,308
Let me...

903
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,409
Relax.

904
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,088
Done!

905
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,158
You house is dusty.

906
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:06,662
I won't get under the bed again!

907
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,328
Pay her...

908
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:11,024
Time is running out.
Think of something.

909
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,530
Get up!

910
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:18,501
Get up!

911
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:20,042
Get out of the bed!

912
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,169
Go back to your room.

913
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:24,510
I like it here. Got a problem?

914
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:33,723
Are you the lady from last time?

915
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:34,723
Yes.

916
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:37,352
It's great to see you again.

917
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,520
Are you feeling better?

918
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:40,688
There's no way to cure asthma.

919
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:41,788
There is!

920
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,064
I got you some medicine.

921
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,569
Use 5 cups of water.

922
01:01:47,638 --> 01:01:49,469
Don't over-cook it.

923
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,564
Thank you.

924
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:51,300
Good night.

925
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,710
You're not heartbroken?

926
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:10,593
Did you take the medicine?

927
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:12,424
- Not yet.
- Why not?

928
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:14,726
I'm taking prescription drugs.

929
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,288
I wanted to check with you first.

930
01:02:16,366 --> 01:02:18,197
Good thing he called me over today.

931
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:20,202
I'm glad to see you.

932
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,334
You made the right decision.

933
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,737
I need to change the medicine.

934
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:25,536
Let me take your pulse.

935
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:29,179
You're pregnant.

936
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,577
It's my baby! Mine!

937
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:31,739
The father is not Chinese.

938
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:34,306
Right. He's Pakistani.

939
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,316
How can you tell?

940
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:37,615
Your pulse said it all.

941
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:40,179
So can I take your medicine?

942
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,691
Then... I'll make some changes.

943
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,590
Watch out for second hand smoke.

944
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:50,228
Cheers!

945
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,559
Want some?

946
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,196
Sure.

947
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,807
You should drink wine in the morning.

948
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:00,471
It increases blood circulation.

949
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:02,209
Bad news!

950
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,406
Boss, Cat is back.

951
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:06,212
Where's she?

952
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:07,511
She's outside the house.

953
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:08,278
Destroy all evidence!

954
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:09,148
Get her luggage!

955
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:12,752
I haven't finished breakfast!

956
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:18,423
Make sure Cat doesn't see anything.

957
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,300
Who is Cat?

958
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,360
She's Tiger's fiancee.
Their wedding is next month.

959
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:29,166
Tiger didn't tell you?

960
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:30,564
No.

961
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:31,938
Tiger doesn't like her.

962
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,301
We forced him into the marriage.

963
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:35,641
We don't like the girl either.

964
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,844
Then why make Tiger marrying her?

965
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:42,215
Business decision.
It's good for both families.

966
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,414
Leave...

967
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,820
Stay here, Cat.

968
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:49,652
Too late.

969
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,760
Who is she?

970
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:53,260
A friend.

971
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,729
Tiger!

972
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:57,164
Did you care about my feelings?

973
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:57,598
Listen to me...

974
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,602
How dare you to bring a woman home?

975
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,797
Look at her ugly face!

976
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:03,339
I'm canceling the wedding.

977
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:04,838
Cat... It's a misunderstanding...

978
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:07,376
It's not what you think.

979
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,207
You're the only one I love.

980
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:09,745
Listen to me.

981
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:10,472
Come on...

982
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:11,741
Cut! Cut!

983
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,510
She's not even watching.

984
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:18,414
What's wrong with you?

985
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,351
It's delicious.

986
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:22,619
Do you love me?

987
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:23,387
I do.

988
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,722
Why aren't you heartbroken?

989
01:04:24,795 --> 01:04:27,457
When your parents mentioned
your wedding,

990
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,499
I was hurting inside.

991
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:32,364
But when she appeared,
all my feelings disappeared.

992
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:34,199
I just feel hungry.

993
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,672
You're a bad actress.

994
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,900
I only told you to lose temper.

995
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:39,966
Why throw cushions around?

996
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,404
You over-acted.

997
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:42,604
It's too exaggerated!

998
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:45,204
You're no better.
Why knock over wineglasses?

999
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,909
You're even worse.

1000
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:48,542
Who told you to pick hair on the table?

1001
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,711
May's got women's intuition.

1002
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:52,618
She can tell what's real and what's not.

1003
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,657
We should get the real Cat.

1004
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,215
What "real Cat"?

1005
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:58,261
The fiancee we want him to marry.

1006
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:00,262
You know about our relationship.

1007
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,388
We agreed to mind our own business.

1008
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:02,454
If she sees this, she'll just say:

1009
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:03,794
"Sorry."

1010
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,459
"Didn't know your girlfriend was here."

1011
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,365
"Have fun."

1012
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:08,028
How can that break May's heart?

1013
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,432
Can I go?

1014
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,768
What's your hurry?

1015
01:05:11,842 --> 01:05:14,436
You're such a lousy actress.

1016
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:15,443
You want a refund?

1017
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:16,877
No need.

1018
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:18,437
I'll make you pay for it.

1019
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:19,504
Try me.

1020
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,647
Cat?

1021
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:23,647
Sorry...

1022
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,814
Didn't know your girlfriend was here.

1023
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,458
Have fun.

1024
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:23,806
Who is she?

1025
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,541
My girlfriend.

1026
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,384
How dare you, Tiger!

1027
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:29,817
Did you care about my feelings?

1028
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:30,750
What?

1029
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,982
We agreed to mind our own business.

1030
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:35,820
But she's prettier than me.

1031
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,619
Did I ever do that to you?

1032
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,559
I think you're better looking.

1033
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:42,097
She's like an angel!

1034
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,731
She's fashionable.

1035
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,394
She chooses appropriate attires.

1036
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,835
She's got a great personality.

1037
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:50,930
She's perfect except for her appetite.

1038
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,497
How does she keep such a good figure?

1039
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:53,975
Are you two serious?

1040
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:55,534
How can I face my friends?

1041
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:56,909
What do you want me to say?

1042
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,845
I still think you're prettier.

1043
01:06:58,915 --> 01:07:00,906
Maybe she's got better temper.

1044
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:03,384
What a show.

1045
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:07,847
Is this another set-up?

1046
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,822
You're not serious, right?

1047
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:11,554
Tell her to leave!

1048
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,705
Let me finish breakfast.

1049
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,529
Is this for real?

1050
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:59,166
Yes. You have to go.

1051
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,415
Can I swallow my food first?

1052
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,974
No, she doesn't like it.

1053
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:11,079
Spit it out.

1054
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:20,087
Please.

1055
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:51,953
Stop!

1056
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:53,987
Take your garbage with you!

1057
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:54,962
Fatty!

1058
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,067
Take care.

1059
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,870
What are you doing?

1060
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,240
She's leaving!

1061
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,672
Your turn!

1062
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,180
Take care!

1063
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,555
What's wrong with you?

1064
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:24,225
We've become good friends.

1065
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:26,992
Do you want to help her?

1066
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:30,998
You want her to beat Misery?

1067
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,071
Like this! Beat it!

1068
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:37,265
Beat it!

1069
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,269
Trash everything.

1070
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:49,980
What?

1071
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:59,057
What's so funny?

1072
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,163
I'm happy

1073
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:04,029
because I'm finally feeling sad.

1074
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,292
Don't cheer up.

1075
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,162
Make sure you stay this way!

1076
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,935
Then make me more upset.

1077
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:11,769
Okay...

1078
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,008
Good!

1079
01:10:13,076 --> 01:10:15,237
Return your clothes and jewelry.

1080
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:16,836
Return everything!

1081
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:28,549
You have to fight a little to feel the pain.

1082
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:31,960
- No...
- Give it!

1083
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:32,926
Give it!

1084
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:33,928
No!

1085
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:35,259
Come on...

1086
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:36,799
No!

1087
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:40,267
Give it all!

1088
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:41,736
No!

1089
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:43,796
Let go. You're too powerful.

1090
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
1, 2, 3

1091
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:46,999
Take care.

1092
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,870
The money is mine.

1093
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:52,972
This makes up for your living expense.

1094
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:54,744
Where will I stay without money?

1095
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:56,649
Sleep on the streets if you have too.

1096
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,085
What will I eat?

1097
01:10:58,154 --> 01:10:58,984
Try the trash can.

1098
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,579
Get me a taxi.

1099
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:01,783
Taxi!

1100
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,083
Beat it!

1101
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:04,655
Take care.

1102
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:05,626
To which park?

1103
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:06,127
Morse Park.

1104
01:11:06,196 --> 01:11:07,060
It's rundown.

1105
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:07,892
Triangle Park!

1106
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,056
Good idea.

1107
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:10,258
Take her to Triangle Park.

1108
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,762
Don't give me money.

1109
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:14,167
Then you're on your own.

1110
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:15,829
What can I do?

1111
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:16,929
Then I'll pay for you.

1112
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,201
But that won't break my heart.

1113
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,606
Then I won't.

1114
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,235
Pay or I won't drive.

1115
01:11:23,246 --> 01:11:24,679
Here you go...

1116
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,277
Get in. Be careful.

1117
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:29,648
You got a phone.

1118
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:30,743
It's in my purse.

1119
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,219
Your purse...

1120
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,647
Got a battery charger?

1121
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,123
There are no outlets in the park.

1122
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:37,659
Batteries.

1123
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,823
Bye.

1124
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,128
Remember: Stay sad!

1125
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:01,880
So you're Omei's Master.

1126
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:03,915
This is a truly amazing

1127
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,751
and shocking story.

1128
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,758
I wonder what he's doing now.

1129
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:13,694
Most likely busy with other women.

1130
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,664
Where is my sword?

1131
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:19,065
It's pouring!

1132
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:21,797
Don't exercise after eating!

1133
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,332
She's heartbroken.

1134
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:27,069
She's completely crushed.

1135
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:31,102
What's the big deal?

1136
01:12:45,295 --> 01:12:47,229
Did that come from her sword?

1137
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:50,892
Must be kids shooting air gun at us.

1138
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:00,469
Better stop doing that, kiddo!

1139
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,007
Where's your manner?

1140
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:04,245
Kiddo, I've called the police!

1141
01:13:04,314 --> 01:13:05,804
I dialed 999!

1142
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,243
I can see you, kiddo!

1143
01:13:12,322 --> 01:13:14,187
I saw you, kiddo!

1144
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:22,931
He fell for it.

1145
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,967
We outsmarted him!

1146
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:05,264
Yes?

1147
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:07,502
What are you doing?

1148
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,368
What's it to you?

1149
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,320
It's pouring here.

1150
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,861
I'm all wet.

1151
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:30,494
Why do I care?

1152
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:38,436
I practiced Heartbreak Sword Technique.

1153
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:40,066
How was it?

1154
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,405
Was it powerful?

1155
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,878
I couldn't do the last 5 moves.

1156
01:14:44,948 --> 01:14:46,609
You need more pain.

1157
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,146
Will you help me?

1158
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:48,979
Sure.

1159
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:51,953
I'll think of something tonight.
I'll come tomorrow.

1160
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,484
Thank you.

1161
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:58,359
Try to stay out of the rain.

1162
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,377
Lunch is ready.

1163
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:19,244
We got some for you.

1164
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:26,286
Come...

1165
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:29,154
No appetite.

1166
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:31,122
Feeling sad?

1167
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,923
He said he'd help me.

1168
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:34,964
But he hasn't shown up.

1169
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,156
You've waited all week.

1170
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:39,098
He already forgot you.

1171
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:41,898
Don't get her upset.

1172
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:44,670
He must be busy preparing his wedding.

1173
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,306
He'll come afterwards.

1174
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:49,004
But he'll be married by then.

1175
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:59,145
See? She's lost it again.

1176
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:18,402
Air gun again?

1177
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:20,101
Screw you, kiddo!

1178
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,004
I saw you kiddo!

1179
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,610
He's not scared.

1180
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:26,979
We can't fool him.

1181
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:30,383
I saw you, little girl!

1182
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,685
It's a little girl this time.

1183
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:38,119
I need more pain!

1184
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:06,547
You said you would come.

1185
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:16,565
I'm in pain.

1186
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,726
Me too!

1187
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:24,570
No. I'm doing worse.

1188
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,269
Why? You're The Heartbreaker!

1189
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,539
I think I messed up.

1190
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:39,187
I came here many times before.

1191
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:42,486
See? The invitation is crumpled.

1192
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,490
A wedding invitation?

1193
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,067
I figured inviting you to my wedding
would break your heart.

1194
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:58,068
I think I'll die!

1195
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:00,509
Let's forget all this.

1196
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:03,044
Don't fight Misery. Give up Omei.

1197
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:06,406
Then all I've done will be in vain.

1198
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:10,077
It'll be a waste of your effort.

1199
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:11,484
That's true.

1200
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:15,683
On my wedding day, will you...

1201
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:16,520
I will!

1202
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:17,115
What?

1203
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,627
I'll come early to get sad.

1204
01:18:21,664 --> 01:18:23,154
I thought you would...

1205
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:24,130
What?

1206
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,791
Nothing.

1207
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:25,625
What?

1208
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,725
Nothing.

1209
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:28,737
What?

1210
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:32,302
Steal me from the wedding!

1211
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,861
Don't leave me, Cat!

1212
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,467
Come on. Cat!

1213
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,205
Calm down.

1214
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:05,501
Excuse me!

1215
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,100
Cat, I love you!

1216
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:10,543
I won't forget you, Cat!

1217
01:19:11,514 --> 01:19:13,448
Cat is the center of the attention.

1218
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,618
Where are Tiger's fans?

1219
01:19:16,686 --> 01:19:19,712
He hasn't been seeing them much lately.

1220
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,593
Cat...

1221
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:35,466
Don't do this to me!

1222
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:40,107
Cat!

1223
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:12,866
Tiger!

1224
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:14,800
Here's one.

1225
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:16,708
Finally!

1226
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:30,559
I'll give up practicing
Heartbreak Sword Technique.

1227
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:32,389
Don't get married.

1228
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:33,621
Sure!

1229
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:36,590
Tiger!

1230
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:44,463
Wait. Something stinks.

1231
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,403
Did you take a shower?

1232
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:47,237
Yes.

1233
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,470
Liar!

1234
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:50,341
Where did you wash yourself?

1235
01:20:50,413 --> 01:20:51,437
Public toilet.

1236
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:52,981
Why use public toilet?

1237
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,979
Because I sleep in the park.

1238
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,185
You know that.

1239
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:58,811
You sleep in the park?

1240
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:00,753
Then you must be a beggar!

1241
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:03,621
Look! We have a beggar here!

1242
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:04,853
Are you playing me?

1243
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,292
Of course I am.

1244
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,829
I'm famous for hurting people's feelings.

1245
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:11,298
I've been waiting for this day
to get even with you.

1246
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,595
Stupid!

1247
01:21:30,586 --> 01:21:32,816
Does it work?

1248
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,549
Are you heartbroken?

1249
01:21:35,825 --> 01:21:37,315
I didn't know
if the wedding will do the job.

1250
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,793
So I thought of this way to insult you.

1251
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:41,454
I'm a man of my words.

1252
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:44,328
I'll help you in any way.

1253
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,292
You scare me.

1254
01:21:46,369 --> 01:21:48,997
I never know what you say is the truth.

1255
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,603
Love is all about getting things
mixed up.

1256
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:52,038
That's why it confuses people.

1257
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,707
Are you in pain now?

1258
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,839
Can I ask you a question?

1259
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:58,971
Sure.

1260
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:04,649
Have you ever loved me?

1261
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,880
Of course not!

1262
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:07,388
It was all make-believe.

1263
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:08,855
No real emotions.

1264
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,551
Only acting.

1265
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:20,960
Thanks for your help.

1266
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:23,062
As long as you're feeling hurt.

1267
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,567
I have one last kill for you.

1268
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,665
Every relationship has its taboo.

1269
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:27,868
Want to know what ours is?

1270
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,537
You already said it.

1271
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:34,273
I did?

1272
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,783
What is it?

1273
01:22:41,924 --> 01:22:44,324
Done! Let's wrap things up.

1274
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,496
Let's settle this.

1275
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:56,696
How?

1276
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,399
Divorce. Give me half of your fortune.

1277
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,634
We're only married for 1 hour.

1278
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,800
- 40%
- 20%

1279
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:01,570
Deal!

1280
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:05,008
Tiger, have you ever loved me?

1281
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,548
Have you?

1282
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:08,810
A little, but there was never any trust.

1283
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:09,908
I feel the same.

1284
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,850
What about her?

1285
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:14,116
I never asked anything from her.

1286
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:15,948
We never even sleep together.

1287
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:17,424
Why go out of your way for her?

1288
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,790
True. Why?

1289
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:20,726
Love. What else?

1290
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,533
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1291
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:26,863
Today's wedding is cancelled.

1292
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:29,063
Please take your gifts with you.

1293
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:49,456
Big Sister!

1294
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,617
Don't call me that!

1295
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:52,490
What Master expelled me from Omei,

1296
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:53,550
I took an oath

1297
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:55,529
to die with Omei.

1298
01:23:55,598 --> 01:23:57,122
Today is Master's funeral anniversary.

1299
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,061
We will all die together.

1300
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,494
I'll kill myself first.

1301
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:03,402
Then I'll kill you one by one.

1302
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:04,939
Scared?

1303
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:08,472
Big Sister...

1304
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:11,573
I can feel your pain now.

1305
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:13,638
Can we not fight?

1306
01:24:16,118 --> 01:24:18,586
You look sad.

1307
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:19,882
Share your problem with someone.

1308
01:24:19,955 --> 01:24:23,447
Talk to your family or friends.

1309
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:25,756
Or a psychiatrist.

1310
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:27,159
Don't mind how people look at you.

1311
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:30,456
Just think happy thoughts.

1312
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,502
Easy said than done.

1313
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,559
I know.

1314
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:38,163
Look what I have become.

1315
01:24:39,775 --> 01:24:42,539
I wonder who it is

1316
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:45,011
that caused you so much pain.

1317
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,809
What's his name?

1318
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:48,713
Tiger Hung.

1319
01:24:49,552 --> 01:24:52,419
Albert Yu is my man,
you stole him from me!

1320
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:54,786
His name is Tiger Hung.

1321
01:24:54,857 --> 01:24:55,881
Not Albert Yu.

1322
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,755
Will you listen to me?

1323
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:37,194
Gift from Tiger.

1324
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,500
Here's more.

1325
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:53,713
Tiger my love!

1326
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:54,976
Don't call me that.

1327
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,680
Call me Master Tiger.

1328
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:02,917
What "Mater Tiger"?

1329
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:05,825
I'll marry May after she beats Misery.

1330
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,862
By then I'll become Master Tiger.

1331
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:10,023
There's no such a thing.

1332
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:13,034
Omei Master must be celibate.

1333
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:15,160
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1334
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:17,902
May, I'm divorced!

1335
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:22,038
Give up Omei. Marry me!

1336
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,541
What are you doing here?

1337
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:28,242
I'm losing my power!

1338
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:29,675
That's exactly what I want!

1339
01:26:29,752 --> 01:26:31,777
I love you!

1340
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:35,280
Misery is too powerful.

1341
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:39,524
When I first met you at Omei,

1342
01:26:39,595 --> 01:26:43,861
I dreamt of our reunion.

1343
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:44,796
Stop singing!

1344
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:45,925
You'll get me killed!

1345
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:48,799
I'll give you my fortune.

1346
01:26:50,606 --> 01:26:52,164
Boss, Misery is crazy.

1347
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:54,869
If May can't beat her, we'll all die!

1348
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:57,169
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1349
01:26:57,246 --> 01:26:58,235
Come!

1350
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:00,948
May, I don't love you anymore.

1351
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,881
Look at my girls.

1352
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:04,077
It's no use.

1353
01:27:04,153 --> 01:27:05,848
I don't feel sad at all.

1354
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:07,646
Damn!

1355
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:09,090
This is not good!

1356
01:27:09,158 --> 01:27:11,353
Is there another way to beat Misery?

1357
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,082
Yes.

1358
01:27:12,161 --> 01:27:14,891
Heartbreak Sword Technique 8th move:
"Eternal Harmony".

1359
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,796
No one could figure it out
since Grand Master died.

1360
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:19,197
"Eternal Harmony"?

1361
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:34,816
What are the first 7 moves?

1362
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:37,875
"Mixed Emotions", "Deep Sorrow",
"Bitter Argument"...

1363
01:27:37,953 --> 01:27:38,715
Understood.

1364
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:40,118
All things come to a happy ending.

1365
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,655
May, I've figured out
"Eternal Harmony"

1366
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,793
Just think of all the good things
I've done for you.

1367
01:27:46,862 --> 01:27:49,626
See how Grand Master has a smile
on her face?

1368
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:50,858
The key is...

1369
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,958
"One eye open, one eye closed"!

1370
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,403
Grand Master is smarter than that.

1371
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:58,833
That's superficial!

1372
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:00,169
Keep thinking.

1373
01:28:00,242 --> 01:28:02,073
There must be hints.

1374
01:28:05,914 --> 01:28:08,348
There's a clue under the skirt!

1375
01:28:13,155 --> 01:28:15,146
"One eye open, one eye closed."

1376
01:28:15,224 --> 01:28:17,192
"Remember the good and not the bad."

1377
01:28:17,259 --> 01:28:19,250
"This is where the answer lies."

1378
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:22,889
"May eternal harmony bless you all."

1379
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,282
That's what I said.

1380
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:51,383
No it's different.

1381
01:29:26,462 --> 01:29:27,986
Congratulations, May.

1382
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:30,893
He proved his affection for you.

1383
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,993
You've recovered, Big Sister.

1384
01:29:34,002 --> 01:29:36,266
If a relationship can cause so much pain,

1385
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:38,932
it's because
it also brought much happiness.

1386
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:45,046
This is the meaning of love.

1387
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,345
You've recovered.

1388
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:55,287
Welcome back, Master!

1389
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:57,382
Welcome back, Master!

1390
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:05,797
What are you thinking about?

1391
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:10,133
I want to create one more move after
"Eternal Harmony".

1392
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:11,763
How should I name it?

1393
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,205
Let's see.

1394
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:16,074
How about "Sons & Daughters"?

1395
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:17,304
Good...

1396
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:18,971
What's the key?

1397
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:21,242
"Eternal Harmony" focuses on
only the good thoughts.

1398
01:30:21,316 --> 01:30:24,513
"Sons & Daughters" focuses on
the bad thoughts.

1399
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:26,084
How bad?

1400
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:27,849
Like this.
