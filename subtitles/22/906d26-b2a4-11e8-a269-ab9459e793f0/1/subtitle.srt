1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,672
"It's that time
Christmas time is here

2
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,110
"Everybody knows
There's not a better time of year

3
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:31,987
"Hear that sleigh."

4
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,242
"Gonna make this holiday
As perfect as can be

5
00:00:57,114 --> 00:01:00,310
"Just wait and see
This Christmas vacation.

6
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:07,121
"This old house
Sure is looking good

7
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:12,302
"Got ourselves the finest snowman
In the neighborhood.

8
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:15,126
"Ain't it fun?

9
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:19,916
"Always on the run
That's how it's done

10
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,386
"On Christmas vacation.

11
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,904
"Let's all deck the halls

12
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,921
"And light the lights

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,181
"Get a toasty fire

14
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:33,360
"Burning bright.

15
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,654
"Give Saint Nick

16
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:39,665
"The warmest welcome
That he's ever had

17
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:43,664
"We're so glad it's Christmas vacation.

18
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:47,755
"And when the nights

19
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:50,575
"Are peaceful and serene

20
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:56,618
"We can cuddle up
And do our Christmas dreamin'.

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,163
"Peace and joy and love

22
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:02,988
"Are everywhere

23
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:07,434
"You can feel the magic in the air.

24
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:14,282
"Let the spirit of the season
Carry us away

25
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:18,534
"Hip, hip, hooray
For Christmas vacation."

26
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,379
That was beautiful, honey.

27
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,482
Take it, Russ.

28
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,952
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

29
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,606
We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

30
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:35,996
...by heading out to the country
in the front-wheel drive sleigh...

31
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,999
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

32
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:42,045
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

33
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:45,687
We're not driving way out here
so you can get one of those stupid ties...

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,898
...with the Santa Clauses on it,
are we, Dad?

35
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,013
No, I have one of those at home.

36
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:54,039
What we're looking for today
is the Griswold family Christmas tree.

37
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,388
- What's the matter?
- Some jackass is riding my tail.

38
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,386
Slow down and let him pass.

39
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:25,806
Don't provoke them.

40
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:28,273
Hey, kids. Look, a deer!

41
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:49,715
Clark! Slow down!

42
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,778
You want to ride behind
somebody like that?

43
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:56,590
I'm going to pull around them...
burn some dust, here.

44
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:58,418
Eat my rubber.

45
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:02,833
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber" and "Eat my dust."

46
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,106
Whatever, Russ.

47
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,467
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

48
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,775
That's enough of that.

49
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:24,780
Speaking of Christmas trees,
can one of you tell me...

50
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:27,749
...what the first kind of tree
displayed at the White House was?

51
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:28,772
They're back.

52
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,748
Stop it! I don't want to spend
the holidays dead.

53
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:40,003
Honey, please. I'll do the driving, okay?

54
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,051
Will you just take it easy?

55
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,104
I'm in complete control.

56
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,305
I'll get around this egg timer.

57
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,833
Uh... Dad?!

58
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,128
We're all right! Thank God!

59
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,393
Clark, we're stuck under a truck!

60
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:09,382
Do you honestly think I don't know that?!

61
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,205
Come on, you guys. Don't fight.

62
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,573
For Christ's sake,
I didn't do this on purpose.

63
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,848
Our Father, who art in heaven...

64
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:22,438
...hallowed be Thy name.
And forgive my husband.

65
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,377
- He knows not what he does.
- Amen!

66
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,414
We made pretty good time.

67
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,856
Dad, didn't they invent
Christmas tree lots...

68
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,915
...so people don't have to drive way out
to nowhere and waste a Saturday?

69
00:06:58,338 --> 00:06:59,199
They invented 'em...

70
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:02,560
...because people forgot how to have
a fun, old-fashioned family Christmas.

71
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:06,585
They're satisfied with scrawny, dead,
overpriced trees with no special meaning.

72
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,549
My toes are numb.

73
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:09,558
This is what our forefathers did.

74
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,548
I can't feel my leg.

75
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,045
They walked out into the woods,
picked out that special tree...

76
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,485
...and they cut it down
with their bare hands.

77
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,372
Mom, I can't feel my hips.

78
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:18,900
- Clark?
- Yes, honey?

79
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,372
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

80
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:23,478
That's all part of the experience, honey.

81
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:26,426
There it is.

82
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,896
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

83
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,584
Isn't it a little big?

84
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,461
It's not big, it's just full.

85
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,112
That thing wouldn't fit in our yard.

86
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,430
It's not going in our yard, Russ.
It's going in our living room.

87
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,758
- Look at it.
- It really is beautiful, Clark.

88
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,802
- It's something else, huh, Russ?
- Yeah, Dad.

89
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,174
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?

90
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,737
She'll see it later, honey.

91
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,310
Her eyes are frozen.

92
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:23,058
The most enduring traditions
of the season are best enjoyed in...

93
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,710
...the warm embrace of kith and kin.

94
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:30,506
This tree is a symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

95
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:34,343
Did you bring a saw?

96
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,191
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his ceiling.

97
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:33,472
Hey, Griswold!

98
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,103
Where will you put a tree that big?

99
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:39,523
Bend over and I'll show you.

100
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,948
You got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

101
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:44,673
I wasn't talking to you.

102
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:03,459
Do you think there's
enough room for the angel?

103
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:07,742
Sure, honey. I have a little more trimming
to do, but that won't be a problem.

104
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:08,800
Ready?

105
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:12,225
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

106
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,984
There's a lot of sap in here.

107
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,592
It looks great. A little full.
A lot of sap.

108
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,296
Did I tell you I talked to my mother today?

109
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,295
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas, too.

110
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,818
It's not too late to change our plans...

111
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:58,419
No, no, that's great.

112
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,642
I think you're forgetting
how difficult it's gonna be...

113
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,048
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

114
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,763
They're family,
not strangers off the street.

115
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,586
All they do is argue.

116
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,665
Christmas is about resolving differences...

117
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,380
...and seeing through
the petty problems of family life.

118
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,277
And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

119
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:23,758
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip, and...

120
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,512
...then they don't speak to...
- Your mother waxes her upper lip?

121
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,176
She has for years.

122
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:29,940
It doesn't show.

123
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:33,805
I don't know, Sparky,
I just have this feeling it's not...

124
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:36,083
I want to have Christmas here,
in our house.

125
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,873
It means a lot to me.

126
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,262
All my life I've wanted to have
a big family Christmas.

127
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:48,072
It's just that you build things up
in your mind, Sparky.

128
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,164
You set standards no family event
can ever live up to.

129
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:55,848
When have I ever done that?

130
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:00,360
Parties.

131
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:02,473
Weddings.

132
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:05,134
- Good night, honey.
- Anniversaries.

133
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:06,793
Funerals.

134
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,191
Holidays.

135
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:10,766
Vacations.

136
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,364
Graduations.

137
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:37,448
Guess you'll be lookin' at
a nice fat Christmas bonus this year, huh?

138
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:39,272
Word is you're an excellent choice
to be named...

139
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,064
...Food Additive Designer of the Year.

140
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:43,236
- Nah...
- I'm not kidding.

141
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,929
What's that new thing you got
over there at Food 'N' Dry?

142
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:49,572
The crunch enhancer?
That's a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

143
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,170
It's semi-permeable. It's not osmotic.

144
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:52,900
What it does is,
it coats and seals the flake.

145
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,312
It prevents the milk from penetrating it.

146
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:56,549
Yeah, it's a beautiful product.

147
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:57,443
I like it.

148
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:59,911
What are you gonna do
with that big bonus check?

149
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,285
You're gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.

150
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:02,596
Me? Heck, no.

151
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,022
Take a look at this.

152
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:11,874
I just hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

153
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:14,495
Oh, my God. You're putting in a pool.

154
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:27,105
I went ahead and I put
a $7,500 deposit down on it.

155
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,274
You're the last true family man.

156
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:31,710
Mark.

157
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:33,729
Clark.

158
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:36,504
That's Bill, sir.

159
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,964
Are you the one who's working
on that non-nutritive cereal varnish?

160
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:40,863
Yes, sir.

161
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:44,125
I've got to give a speech to a trade group.
I'd like to mention it.

162
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:47,227
Write up a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

163
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:48,279
My pleasure.

164
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:52,507
Layman's terms. None of that inside,
bullshit jargon that nobody understands.

165
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,106
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,774
Oh, Mr. Shirley...

167
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:00,990
We got your Christmas card
the other day, and...

168
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:04,186
...my family and I are very flattered
that you remembered us.

169
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:05,847
Corporate cards.

170
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,732
Don't forget that report, Bill.

171
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,267
Yes, sir. Merry Christmas.

172
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,836
Merry Christmas. Kiss my ass.
Kiss his ass. Kiss your ass.

173
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:20,374
Happy Hanukkah.

174
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,090
Can I show you something?

175
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:56,495
I was just smelling... smiling.

176
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,179
I was blouse... browsing.

177
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:02,314
For your wife or girlfriend?

178
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:05,936
What? What happened?

179
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:14,130
I guess it wouldn't be any...

180
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,001
It wouldn't be
the Christmas shopping season...

181
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:20,523
...if the stores were any less hooter
than they... Hotter than they are.

182
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:22,635
It is warm in here.

183
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,811
- When you have your coat on.
- Do I?

184
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:27,083
- How did that happen?
- Because it's cold out.

185
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,161
Yes. Yes.

186
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,950
It is. It's a bit nipply out.
I mean, nippy out.

187
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:34,155
What am I saying? Nipple?

188
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,033
There is a nip in the air, though.

189
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,143
Can I take something out for you?

190
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,544
I was just, uh...

191
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,716
I was looking at something for my wife.

192
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:54,316
God rest her soul.

193
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,036
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

194
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:59,370
Oh, no, no, she's not dead, yet.
We're just divorced.

195
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:01,352
She's history.

196
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:03,145
Obviously, she doesn't wear underwear...

197
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:07,402
...there are plenty of shopping days
left until adultery... adulthood.

198
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:10,827
Which is to say, Christmas,
as in Yule. Yule log.

199
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:14,016
Not a log. I don't have a log, but I mean,
you know...

200
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:17,254
...if I had a log. Not in the sense
you think I said I did.

201
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,066
Good golly.

202
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,726
'Tis the season to be merry.

203
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:24,130
Well, that's my name.

204
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,314
No shit.

205
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,815
These are cut really high on the hip.

206
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:46,300
Look, I'm wearing something similar.
See? You can't see the line.

207
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,372
- You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
- No.

208
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,413
Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...

209
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,716
...an angel gets his wings.

210
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,185
Folks!

211
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:37,910
Merry Christmas.

212
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,496
Look how big you've gotten.

213
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,509
Merry Christmas.

214
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:53,112
Mom.

215
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:55,024
Knock on the door.

216
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,697
Doesn't Nora look old?

217
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:01,263
You promised, you promised...

218
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,378
They took a pint of fluid
out of my lower back.

219
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,646
You see this mole? This mole on my neck?
You think it's changing color?

220
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:09,047
No. You keep touching it.
It's getting redder.

221
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:10,421
I got hemorrhoids.

222
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,445
Could you believe that?

223
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,236
- Oh, Mother.
- Isn't that terrible?

224
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,853
- You're not getting the space...
- After what you did to my car?

225
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm doing the parking.
Come and help me with the...

226
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:21,071
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy...

227
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:24,404
Sweetheart, your grandma Nora's got
a real painful burr on her heel.

228
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,771
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a quarter.

229
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,587
- A quarter.
- And I'll give Audrey a quarter, too.

230
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,173
I'm going to put my car in the garage!

231
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,067
I'll park the cars.

232
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,681
This is what Christmas is all about.

233
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,280
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage, and...

234
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:44,943
I'll be outside for the season.

235
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,888
We'll have the best-looking house in town.

236
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,718
I've always wanted to do this.

237
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,444
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

238
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,327
I'm sure it's a lot of work,
but if I'm out in the cold...

239
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:59,531
...and I'm committed
to decorating the house...

240
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:02,318
...l'm gonna do it right
and I'm gonna do it big.

241
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,770
You want something
you can be proud of, don't you?

242
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,181
Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:09,096
Sure you do.

244
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,821
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?

245
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:15,115
Russ, when was the last time
I overdid anything?

246
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,035
Come on, unravel these.

247
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:23,050
You have to check every bulb.

248
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,669
A little knot here. You work on that.

249
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,441
I'll get the other box.

250
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:43,680
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.

251
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:48,194
I'm sure he'll fall. But I don't think we're
lucky enough to have him break his neck.

252
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,813
Let's go.

253
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:22,689
These gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with the giant nutcracker float.

254
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:26,711
At this point, I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.

255
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:31,198
But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.

256
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,655
Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.

257
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:51,186
Would it be indecent
to ask the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

258
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:55,057
Can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

259
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,775
Alexander called this morning
and Grandpa Clark told him...

260
00:21:57,844 --> 00:22:00,943
...I couldn't come to the phone
'cause I was going to the bathroom.

261
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:03,085
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

262
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:04,273
Everybody?

263
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,202
Do you sleep with your brother? Do you
know how sick and twisted that is?

264
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:12,268
I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

265
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:17,008
I have nightmares about what he does in
bed alone when I'm not lying next to him.

266
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:20,430
I don't know what to say
except it's Christmas...

267
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,605
...and we're all in misery.

268
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:25,927
Ellen, are you smoking again?

269
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,174
No!

270
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,325
Dad, where do you want these reindeer?

271
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:43,719
Just put them on the lawn, Russ.

272
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,692
I can't find the Santa Claus.

273
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,691
It's in the basement. We'll get it later.

274
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:47,617
Clark? Dinner's ready.

275
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,718
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

276
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:13,245
Obviously something broke the window.
Something hit the stereo.

277
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,143
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?

278
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,546
I don't know, Margo.

279
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,165
You wanna hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

280
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:42,358
Two hundred and fifty strands of lights,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

281
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,195
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

282
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:49,619
Twenty-five thousand.

283
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,858
I hope nobody I know drives by...

284
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:55,505
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at my house in my pajamas.

285
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,577
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

286
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:00,077
Fire it up!

287
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:05,297
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

288
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,684
Drum roll, please.

289
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:13,197
Drum roll.

290
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,893
"Joy to the world."

291
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:46,032
Beautiful, Clark.

292
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:49,033
Talk about pissing your money away.

293
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:54,062
I hope you kids see what a silly waste
of resources this was.

294
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,228
He worked really hard, Grandma.

295
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:58,155
So do washing machines.

296
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,717
Let's get in where it's warm.

297
00:26:05,358 --> 00:26:09,830
Clark, baby, I can picture it
in my mind and it's breathtaking.

298
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:14,277
Thanks, Mom.

299
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:19,778
It's probably a bad bulb. You know, if
one goes out, the whole thing won't work.

300
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,045
If I were you,
I'd personally check each one.

301
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:24,551
I did that, Dad.

302
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:28,488
If you need any help, give me a holler.
I'll be upstairs asleep.

303
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:34,631
I'm sorry, Daddy. It looks good,
even if they're not lit.

304
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:37,696
Thank you, sweetheart.

305
00:26:43,913 --> 00:26:46,465
Well, Dad, it was a good try.

306
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,069
Thanks, Russ.

307
00:26:50,631 --> 00:26:52,900
We checked every bulb, didn't we?

308
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,639
I'm sure of it.

309
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:01,531
Maybe we ought to go up there and just...

310
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,263
Geez! Look at the time.

311
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,561
I have to go to bed.

312
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:07,874
Brush my teeth, feed the hog.

313
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:12,031
I still got some homework to do,
do the laundry, wash the car...

314
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,738
Don't stay up too late.

315
00:27:40,383 --> 00:27:42,653
Get off me, you little fungus.

316
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,250
Where the hell is that cold coming from?

317
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:06,206
- I need just a few more...
- Pay by check, if you can.

318
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:09,566
- Not a card?
- No, it's a hassle if you have to return.

319
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:17,091
Help!

320
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,330
Daddy. Is Clark coming?

321
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:20,608
How the hell would I know?

322
00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:21,606
Is he in the house?

323
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,451
If he's not farting around
with the lights, he must be.

324
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:27,267
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

325
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:32,035
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pill.

326
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,939
I want to take off these clothes,
sit with a glass of wine...

327
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:28,863
...and kiss every inch of your body.

328
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:31,644
- After you shower, of course.
- Of course.

329
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:49,659
- Sparky?
- Yes, honey.

330
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:01,647
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

331
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:04,695
I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

332
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:07,416
Meantime, I can light the Santa...

333
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,613
...and the eight tiny reindeer
and the "Merry Christmas" sign.

334
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:13,070
That should look good. Ready?

335
00:35:13,337 --> 00:35:14,930
Want me to do the drum roll thing?

336
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,008
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

337
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,999
I don't understand it.

338
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,737
The house lights don't work,
the floodlights don't work.

339
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,346
Is it plugged in?

340
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:37,394
Do you think I would check
thousands of tiny lights...

341
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:40,395
...if I wasn't sure
the extension cord was plugged in?

342
00:35:42,197 --> 00:35:44,585
You used more than one cord, didn't you?

343
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:50,544
Maybe the kids have been fooling around
with it. I'll check in the back.

344
00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:11,535
Clark!

345
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:15,689
- Todd!
- Sorry!

346
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:21,483
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

347
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,541
I can't see!

348
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:56,806
This ought to do it.

349
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:10,939
I fixed it!

350
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:17,059
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

351
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:27,619
- Get a towel.
- Okay!

352
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:32,894
Wait a minute! I don't believe this.

353
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:35,166
What's all that yelling about?

354
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:38,425
What's going on here?!

355
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,173
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

356
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:45,366
What's he doing?

357
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:47,161
I haven't the foggiest.

358
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,808
What the hell?!

359
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,495
What is wrong with this?!

360
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:56,630
Damn it!

361
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,460
You goddamn thing!

362
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,504
Dad, it's beautiful!

363
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,629
Oh, my carpet!

364
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,763
Clark, it's so lovely.

365
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:09,681
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

366
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:15,112
It's a beaut, Clark. A beaut.

367
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:20,073
You taught me everything I know
about exterior illumination.

368
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:21,837
Thank you, thank you.

369
00:39:23,026 --> 00:39:24,367
Russ. Audrey.

370
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,797
Dear... Francis.

371
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,238
I hope this adds
to your enjoyment of the holidays.

372
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,469
It's just wonderful.

373
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,831
Arthur.

374
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:43,747
Art.

375
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:46,470
Dad.

376
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,452
Thanks for being here.

377
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:51,052
The little lights are not twinkling.

378
00:39:51,118 --> 00:39:53,670
I know, Art, and thanks for noticing.

379
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,385
The house sure does look swell, Clark.

380
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,736
Thanks, Eddie.

381
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:06,149
I hope it enhances your holiday spirit.
Dear Catherine.

382
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:08,035
Eddie?

383
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:11,647
The house is gorgeous, Clark.

384
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:13,827
Eddie?

385
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:17,182
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

386
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:20,961
Kids, come on out here and see
what Uncle Clark's done to the house.

387
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:22,048
Eddie?

388
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,119
Eddie?

389
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,741
If you don't remember, this here is Rocky.

390
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,229
- Have you got a kiss for me?
- Take a rain check on that, Art.

391
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:43,010
He's got a lip fungus
that ain't identified yet.

392
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:47,514
You remember Ruby Sue?

393
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:51,584
Oh, my gosh!

394
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:55,071
Her eyes are not crossed anymore.

395
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,546
That somethin', ain't it?

396
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:58,618
She falls in a well, her eyes go cross.

397
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:01,986
A mule kicks her, they go back to normal.
I don't know.

398
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,579
And this here is our pride and joy.

399
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:09,024
Snots.

400
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:11,002
Pretty name.

401
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:14,039
We named him that
'cause he's got this sinus condition.

402
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:17,980
Snots, you roll over
and let Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

403
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:23,260
You never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

404
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:25,623
That's okay, Eddie.

405
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:28,535
That's somethin', ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

406
00:41:28,606 --> 00:41:30,710
...and he'll love you till the day you die.

407
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:33,268
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

408
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:38,294
We were going to call,
but Eddie wanted to make it a surprise.

409
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,801
You surprised?

410
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,043
Surprised, Eddie?

411
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,543
If I woke up tomorrow
with my head sewn to the carpet...

412
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:46,041
...I wouldn't be more surprised
than I am right now.

413
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,129
We have plenty of room.

414
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,633
Plenty of towels. Plenty of everything.

415
00:41:57,178 --> 00:42:01,006
We're pretty well set up here in the RV.
It's a little tight but...

416
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,022
...we didn't come to impose.

417
00:42:03,097 --> 00:42:04,853
There's plenty of room.

418
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,247
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

419
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:13,074
Catherine and I are pretty comfy in there,
but maybe you folks wouldn't mind...

420
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,769
...the youngsters shacking up with you.

421
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,594
After that long drive...

422
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:19,248
...we could use
a little private time together.

423
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:25,105
Honey, why don't you get the kids' things.
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

424
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:26,929
I'll show you the home.

425
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:05,381
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.

426
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:07,400
Is it real?

427
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,057
I dug it out of the ground myself.

428
00:43:10,127 --> 00:43:11,403
Is that a fact?

429
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:13,511
Get out of there, Snots!

430
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:14,529
Don't worry about it.

431
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:17,026
A little tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

432
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:19,980
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

433
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:22,762
He lifted his leg the next mornin'...

434
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,785
If he drinks the water out of there,
the tree's gonna dry up.

435
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:29,477
Come on out of there.

436
00:43:30,762 --> 00:43:35,072
Get out of there. Go in the kitchen
and get something to eat.

437
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:37,412
He's cute, ain't he?

438
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:41,223
Only problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

439
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:45,539
If the mood catches him right,
he'll grab your leg and just go to town.

440
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:50,438
You don't want him around
if you're wearing short pants.

441
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,989
A word of warning, though.

442
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:56,162
If he does lay into you,
it's best to just let him finish.

443
00:43:58,758 --> 00:44:02,205
I can't believe you're actually
standing here in my living room, Eddie.

444
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:03,878
Never thought the day would come.

445
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:05,698
I'm excited about it, too.

446
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:09,474
It's a cryin' shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

447
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,394
I'll get that.
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

448
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:23,549
I got the daughter in the clinic
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

449
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:28,095
The older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

450
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:30,168
- College?
- Carnival.

451
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,444
You gotta be proud.

452
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:37,979
Last season, he was a pixie dust spreader
on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

453
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:41,305
He thinks that maybe next year,
he'll be guessing people's weight...

454
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:43,351
...or barking for the Yak Woman.

455
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:46,685
- You ever see her?
- No.

456
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,947
She got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

457
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:52,563
She's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.

458
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:53,784
And a hell of a good cook.

459
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:56,440
Can I refill your eggnog for you?
Get you something to eat?

460
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,898
Drive you out to the middle of nowhere
and leave you for dead?

461
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:01,045
No, I'm doing just fine.

462
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:02,906
Just glad to be here.

463
00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:07,062
When did you get
the tenement on wheels?

464
00:45:07,868 --> 00:45:10,584
Oh, that? That's an RV.

465
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:13,620
I borrowed it off a buddy of mine.

466
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,407
He took my house, I took the RV.

467
00:45:17,307 --> 00:45:19,216
It's a good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

468
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:21,721
It looks so nice parked in the driveway.

469
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:24,982
It sure does.
Don't you go falling in love with it.

470
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,655
We're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

471
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:40,820
Get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures!

472
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,439
Retooling. That's a great excuse.

473
00:45:45,462 --> 00:45:47,699
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

474
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,491
Mr. Shirley, Merry Christmas.

475
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:54,095
Who's that?

476
00:45:54,996 --> 00:45:56,589
It's me, Clark Griswold.

477
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,161
What do you want?

478
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,376
My wife and I just came up with
a little something special. It's a gift.

479
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:06,891
Put it over there
with the others, Greaseball.

480
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:21,414
By the way, I hope my report helped out
at the trade show.

481
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:28,005
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

482
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,916
If you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of an important call.

483
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:34,124
Get me somebody.

484
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:35,432
Anybody.

485
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,662
And get me somebody while I'm waiting.

486
00:46:51,116 --> 00:46:55,108
This is a new non-caloric,
silicon-based kitchen lubricant...

487
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:56,487
...my company's been working on.

488
00:46:56,555 --> 00:47:00,100
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than cooking oil.

489
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,505
We'll fly down the hill with this stuff.

490
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,864
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?

491
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:06,345
Not that I know of.

492
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:11,678
Don't go puttin' none of that stuff
on my sled, Clark.

493
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:15,204
- You know the metal plate in my head?
- How could I forget it.

494
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:19,044
I had it replaced. Every time
Catherine raved up the microwave...

495
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:21,892
...l'd piss in my pants
and forget who I was.

496
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:25,028
Over at the V.A., they had it replaced
with a plastic one.

497
00:47:25,286 --> 00:47:27,195
That ain't as strong, so...

498
00:47:27,686 --> 00:47:29,758
I shouldn't go sailing down a hill...

499
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:32,001
...with nothing between
the ground and my brain...

500
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,208
...but a piece of government plastic.

501
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,375
You really think it matters, Eddie?

502
00:47:37,444 --> 00:47:40,161
The plate runs right underneath my part.

503
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:44,320
Over here is nothing, but...

504
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:49,280
...if this gets dented,
then my hair just ain't going to look right.

505
00:47:51,842 --> 00:47:53,249
I know the feeling.

506
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:56,929
I better try this first. See how it works.

507
00:47:56,993 --> 00:47:58,749
Be careful there, Clark.

508
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:00,672
Nothing to worry about, Eddie.

509
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:05,023
Going for a new, amateur-recreational-
saucer-sled land-speed record...

510
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,829
Clark W. Griswold, Junior!

511
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,676
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

512
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:15,996
Later, dudes.

513
00:48:17,279 --> 00:48:19,188
Let her rip. Hang ten.

514
00:48:36,188 --> 00:48:37,562
It's great! I'm dead!

515
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:23,021
Bingo.

516
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,360
- You're staying late?
- Hi, Bill.

517
00:49:37,426 --> 00:49:38,702
Yeah. Just...

518
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:42,693
...finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

519
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:46,062
Have a really Merry Christmas.

520
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:48,359
You, too.

521
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:51,847
You okay?

522
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:53,827
Yeah.

523
00:49:55,503 --> 00:49:57,892
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

524
00:49:58,223 --> 00:50:00,045
Just talked to my son.

525
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:03,115
Company messenger just brought
something to my house.

526
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,867
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute, huh?

527
00:50:07,022 --> 00:50:08,232
You get yours?

528
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,805
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it must be on its way.

529
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,553
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

530
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,630
Don't sweat it. It'll come.

531
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:19,909
Merry Christmas.

532
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:21,157
Same to you.

533
00:50:40,456 --> 00:50:44,133
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is the thing to say

534
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:46,685
"On a bright Hawaiian

535
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,512
"Christmas day.

536
00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:51,647
"That's the island greeting

537
00:50:51,814 --> 00:50:54,748
"That we send to you
From the land

538
00:50:55,493 --> 00:50:57,729
"Where palm trees sway.

539
00:50:58,661 --> 00:51:00,570
"Here we know that Christmas

540
00:51:00,805 --> 00:51:02,463
"Will be green and bright

541
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:05,087
"The sun to shine by day

542
00:51:05,252 --> 00:51:07,161
"And all the stars at night.

543
00:51:07,555 --> 00:51:11,548
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is Hawaii's way

544
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,909
"To say 'Merry Christmas' to you."

545
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:28,340
Santy Claus?

546
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,635
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

547
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:32,724
What?

548
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:37,867
What? You scared me.

549
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:41,715
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

550
00:52:45,077 --> 00:52:46,255
I wish I was.

551
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:50,475
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

552
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:53,708
Rocky bit my thumb.

553
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:57,071
Him's nervous
because Christmas is almost here.

554
00:52:58,195 --> 00:52:59,601
Nervous or excited?

555
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:01,391
Shittin' bricks.

556
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:04,103
You shouldn't use that word.

557
00:53:04,178 --> 00:53:06,566
Sorry. Shittin' rocks.

558
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:12,549
Him's nervous because he don't know
if he's gettin' nothin'.

559
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:18,506
I don't think he should be nervous,
and you shouldn't be, either.

560
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:21,292
'Cause if you're good, Santa knows it.

561
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:24,363
If you believe in him and in your mom...

562
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,056
...and you believe in...

563
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:27,627
...your dad...

564
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:33,124
...and you've been good all year round,
Santa Claus will bring you something.

565
00:53:33,709 --> 00:53:36,742
Sometimes I think
all that Santa crap is just bull.

566
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:40,425
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

567
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:43,947
We didn't do nothin' wrong
and we still got the shaft.

568
00:53:44,107 --> 00:53:47,936
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

569
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,657
And in the next couple of days...

570
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:53,382
...somehow, I'm gonna prove it to you.

571
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,600
Every year, he comes to our house.
I've seen him.

572
00:53:58,825 --> 00:53:59,840
It's true?

573
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:01,382
Cross my heart.

574
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:07,072
It's a good idea you came to stay with us.

575
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:11,136
I love it here. You don't gotta put on
your coat to go to the bathroom.

576
00:54:11,303 --> 00:54:14,020
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

577
00:54:17,383 --> 00:54:19,619
I think you better go back to bed, now.

578
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,341
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

579
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:29,053
I was looking for something.

580
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,474
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

581
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:38,879
Nope. How come?

582
00:54:39,138 --> 00:54:40,731
Just wondering.

583
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:48,250
Now you get back to bed. Come here.

584
00:54:54,784 --> 00:54:57,467
Are you sure you ain't Santy Claus?

585
00:54:58,656 --> 00:54:59,638
I'm sure.

586
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:06,654
I can't even afford to be an elf.

587
00:55:17,373 --> 00:55:21,365
I had two containers of K-rations...
two containers...

588
00:55:21,692 --> 00:55:24,987
...and I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears!

589
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,558
Aren't you having any breakfast?

590
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,218
No. Not in the mood.

591
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,355
What are you looking at?

592
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:47,762
The silent majesty of a winter's morn.
The clean...

593
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,935
...cool chill of the holiday air.

594
00:55:50,103 --> 00:55:53,616
An asshole, in a bathrobe,
emptying a chemical toilet into my sewer.

595
00:55:58,711 --> 00:56:00,172
The shitter was full.

596
00:56:01,046 --> 00:56:02,901
Have you checked our shitters, honey?

597
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:05,354
Clark, please.
He doesn't know any better.

598
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:07,790
He ought to know it's illegal.
It's a storm sewer.

599
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:12,084
If it fills with gas, I pity the person
who lights a match within ten yards of it.

600
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,274
Merry Christmas.

601
00:56:35,697 --> 00:56:37,158
The shitter was full.

602
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:55,628
I have this suspicion that Catherine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.

603
00:56:55,694 --> 00:57:00,166
Rocky said Eddie told him
Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

604
00:57:02,156 --> 00:57:06,890
Ruby Sue said the same thing last night.
How can they have nothing for their kids?

605
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:08,962
He's been out of work
for almost seven years.

606
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:11,207
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

607
00:57:11,276 --> 00:57:14,952
Catherine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

608
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:20,485
So, how's the live bait business?

609
00:57:20,554 --> 00:57:23,270
I can't complain. How you doing?

610
00:57:23,912 --> 00:57:25,506
Not that good, actually.

611
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:29,282
Your company kill off all them people
in India not long ago?

612
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:31,684
No, we missed out on that one.

613
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,556
You're pretty set so far as shopping goes?

614
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,187
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark.

615
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,999
The truth is, things ain't goin'
too good at all.

616
00:57:40,071 --> 00:57:43,366
You know I told you I borrowed
the RV from a neighbor?

617
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:44,922
It's mine.

618
00:57:45,477 --> 00:57:46,622
We live in it.

619
00:57:46,886 --> 00:57:50,300
I had to sell off the house,
the barn, the ten acres...

620
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:55,579
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

621
00:57:57,828 --> 00:58:01,340
If I only had back the money
me and Catherine sent that TV preacher...

622
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,712
...that was screwin' the hockey players.

623
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:06,143
What about the kids?

624
00:58:06,594 --> 00:58:08,535
His kids can fend for themselves.

625
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:10,079
Your kids.

626
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,948
That's the bitch of it.
I don't know what to do.

627
00:58:13,985 --> 00:58:18,294
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Guerney.

628
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:25,434
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

629
00:58:25,504 --> 00:58:27,576
No, Clark, I couldn't do that.

630
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:29,110
We insist.

631
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,677
No, I'm not one for charity.

632
00:58:31,903 --> 00:58:35,197
I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

633
00:58:37,341 --> 00:58:39,197
I don't know about that.

634
00:58:39,422 --> 00:58:43,251
Now, come on, if you don't tell me
what they want, I'll get it on my own.

635
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,976
This is a surprise, Clark.

636
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:52,691
This is a real nice surprise.

637
00:58:53,595 --> 00:58:56,050
Just a real nice surprise.

638
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:02,064
Here's a list.

639
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,526
Alphabetical, starting with Catherine.

640
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:08,693
If it wouldn't be too much,
I'd like to get something for you, Clark.

641
00:59:08,826 --> 00:59:11,214
Something really nice.

642
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:29,904
Is your house on fire, Clark?

643
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:32,075
No Bethany, those are Christmas lights.

644
00:59:32,149 --> 00:59:33,872
Don't throw me down, Clark.

645
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:35,249
I'll try not to.

646
00:59:35,892 --> 00:59:37,648
Is this the airport?

647
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,086
We're here!

648
00:59:39,189 --> 00:59:42,603
Me and Bethany figured out
the perfect gift for you.

649
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,424
Uncle Louis, you didn't have to
buy me anything.

650
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:47,727
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

651
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:49,897
That was fun.

652
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:52,526
I love riding in cars.

653
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:55,727
When did you move to Florida?

654
00:59:58,705 --> 01:00:00,973
Are you still dating Clark?

655
01:00:04,464 --> 01:00:06,536
You know you shouldn't have done that.

656
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,997
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

657
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:13,509
Jesus, did the room clear out, Bethany?
Hell, no.

658
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:16,614
She means presents.
You shouldn't have bought presents.

659
01:00:16,686 --> 01:00:20,460
It isn't every day somebody moves
into a new house.

660
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:22,693
They didn't move into a new house.

661
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,087
In the living room.

662
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:30,281
This house is bigger than your old one.

663
01:00:31,947 --> 01:00:34,019
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

664
01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:39,399
Why don't you go into the living room
and say hello to everybody?

665
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:42,689
Hello, everybody! I should say it?

666
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:48,134
- Mom?
- What?

667
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:50,276
This box is meowing.

668
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:58,368
She wrapped up her damn cat.

669
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,414
- Take it in the kitchen. Open it up.
- And have a cat running around?

670
01:01:01,479 --> 01:01:02,853
We can't leave it in the box.

671
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:05,307
Why would somebody wrap up
a cat in a box?

672
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:07,525
She gets confused. She's old.

673
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,589
They don't have much money,
so she takes things from the house...

674
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:12,734
...wraps them up,
gives them away as presents.

675
01:01:12,805 --> 01:01:14,299
Can't wait to see what I got!

676
01:01:14,373 --> 01:01:15,965
This one here...

677
01:01:16,196 --> 01:01:17,406
...is leaking.

678
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:23,998
Lime.

679
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:25,859
It's her Jell-O mold.

680
01:01:25,924 --> 01:01:29,949
I'll take it, Eddie. Go into
the living room and enjoy yourself.

681
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,748
Let's go find your sister.

682
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:56,215
Before we begin...

683
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:59,382
...since this is Aunt Bethany's
80th Christmas...

684
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,717
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

685
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:07,765
What, dear?

686
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:10,552
Grace!

687
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,289
Grace? She passed away 30 years ago.

688
01:02:16,283 --> 01:02:18,422
They want you to say grace.

689
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:23,220
The blessing.

690
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:40,758
"I pledge allegiance...

691
01:02:40,984 --> 01:02:44,496
"...to the flag of
the United States of America...

692
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:46,511
"...and to the republic...

693
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:50,833
"...for which it stands,
one nation under God, indivisible...

694
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:54,578
"...with liberty and justice for all."

695
01:02:56,662 --> 01:02:57,360
Amen.

696
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:07,155
Catherine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

697
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,868
...I think we're all
in for a very big treat.

698
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:15,630
Save the neck for me, Clark.

699
01:03:31,472 --> 01:03:32,584
I'm sorry.

700
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:34,598
Why are you crying?

701
01:03:34,671 --> 01:03:37,060
I told you we put it in too early.

702
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:39,850
It's just a little dry. It's fine.

703
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:43,493
Here's the heart.

704
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:43,233
Aunt Bethany...

705
01:04:44,804 --> 01:04:46,844
Does your cat happen to eat Jell-O?

706
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:50,882
I don't know about the cat...

707
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:52,576
...but I'm enjoying it.

708
01:05:05,377 --> 01:05:06,174
Kids...

709
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:08,088
...I heard on the news...

710
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:12,601
...that an airline pilot spotted Santa's sled
on its way in from New York.

711
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:19,416
You serious, Clark?

712
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,683
Load me up with a little more there.
It's good.

713
01:05:36,093 --> 01:05:37,751
What's wrong with the dog?

714
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:45,846
He's just yackin' on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

715
01:05:47,578 --> 01:05:50,033
Maybe if you wouldn't feed him
from the table...

716
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,107
No.

717
01:05:53,914 --> 01:05:56,783
He's probably just nosing
through the trash.

718
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:08,788
If you're not doing anything constructive...

719
01:06:08,855 --> 01:06:11,375
...run into the living room, get my stogie.

720
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,604
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Uncle Louis?

721
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:18,290
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

722
01:06:19,445 --> 01:06:22,064
He keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

723
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:55,659
That should be it.

724
01:07:11,405 --> 01:07:13,860
I told you, you had
too many plugs in one outlet.

725
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,226
What is it?

726
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:22,219
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

727
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:27,809
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

728
01:07:32,618 --> 01:07:36,447
If you don't mind,
I'd like to try to fumigate this here chair.

729
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,853
It's a good quality item.

730
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:44,767
If you don't mind me askin',
how much it set you back?

731
01:07:45,768 --> 01:07:47,294
Do you smell something?

732
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:50,853
Fried pussycat.

733
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:56,958
It's not the chair, it's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

734
01:08:44,894 --> 01:08:46,138
My tree!

735
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:50,196
So, what's the matter with you?

736
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:53,173
Look what you've done to my tree!

737
01:09:07,931 --> 01:09:09,818
It was an ugly tree anyway.

738
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:12,593
At least it's out of its misery.

739
01:09:13,242 --> 01:09:15,183
- Dad's gonna flip out.
- Nobody's gonna flip out.

740
01:09:15,257 --> 01:09:17,624
We're gonna have a wonderful Christmas.

741
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,391
What the hell do you want?

742
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:25,140
I have a delivery for Clark W. Griswold.

743
01:09:25,305 --> 01:09:27,443
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

744
01:09:27,576 --> 01:09:31,732
...but it fell between the seats
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

745
01:09:38,614 --> 01:09:39,891
Merry Christmas.

746
01:09:41,078 --> 01:09:42,354
Merry Christmas.

747
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:47,824
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

748
01:09:48,469 --> 01:09:51,186
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nuthouse?

749
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:52,941
It's from my company.

750
01:09:53,716 --> 01:09:54,479
Your bonus.

751
01:09:55,188 --> 01:09:56,049
My bonus.

752
01:10:01,586 --> 01:10:03,310
Open it, Clarkie. Open it.

753
01:10:03,955 --> 01:10:06,027
I hope it's a fortune.

754
01:10:06,675 --> 01:10:07,885
I bet you do.

755
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:13,543
I was afraid...

756
01:10:13,808 --> 01:10:17,484
Are you going to bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

757
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:23,341
I was gonna wait till tomorrow
to tell you all this, but what the heck?

758
01:10:24,175 --> 01:10:27,403
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

759
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:33,705
That's it. That's the big one!

760
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:37,060
Open it!

761
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:42,987
I'm sorry if I've been
a little short with everyone lately.

762
01:10:43,532 --> 01:10:45,255
I've been waiting for this bonus.

763
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:47,556
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

764
01:10:47,628 --> 01:10:49,537
...I had to lay out the money in advance.

765
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:53,604
Until this arrived, I didn't have enough
to cover the check.

766
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:56,035
Tear the sucker open, Dad.

767
01:10:57,706 --> 01:10:58,502
Drum roll.

768
01:11:07,049 --> 01:11:10,977
If there's enough left,
I'll fly you all down to help us dedicate it.

769
01:11:14,919 --> 01:11:16,413
I can't swim, Clark.

770
01:11:17,735 --> 01:11:18,979
I know that, Eddie.

771
01:11:33,349 --> 01:11:34,494
What's wrong?

772
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,936
It's bigger than you expected?

773
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,418
Smaller?

774
01:11:47,139 --> 01:11:48,251
What is it?

775
01:11:49,986 --> 01:11:53,630
A one-year membership
in the Jelly-of-the-Month Club.

776
01:11:54,753 --> 01:11:58,581
That's the gift that keeps on giving
the whole year.

777
01:12:00,256 --> 01:12:01,663
That it is, Edward.

778
01:12:02,592 --> 01:12:03,704
That it is, indeed.

779
01:12:04,576 --> 01:12:05,688
I'm sorry.

780
01:12:07,776 --> 01:12:12,412
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got! Goddamn it!

781
01:12:13,406 --> 01:12:14,169
Son.

782
01:12:27,068 --> 01:12:28,661
It's good.

783
01:12:37,242 --> 01:12:40,689
If any of you are looking
for any last-minute gift ideas for me...

784
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:42,006
...I have one.

785
01:12:42,745 --> 01:12:45,363
I'd like Frank Shirley,
my boss, right here, tonight.

786
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:50,485
Brought from his happy holiday slumber
on Melody Lane with all the rich people.

787
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:52,558
I want him brought right here...

788
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:57,044
...with a big ribbon on his head and
I want to look him straight in the eye...

789
01:12:57,303 --> 01:13:00,651
...and I want to tell him
what a cheap, lying, no good, rotten...

790
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:03,792
...low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating,
inbred, overstuffed...

791
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:08,268
...ignorant, bloodsucking,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

792
01:13:08,726 --> 01:13:12,238
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

793
01:13:12,405 --> 01:13:15,273
...worm-headed sack of monkey shit he is!

794
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:16,881
Hallelujah!

795
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,602
Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?

796
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,512
He has that crazy look in his eye.

797
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:36,814
I told you we should have gone to Hawaii.

798
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:39,592
Turn that thing off and get in the house!

799
01:13:40,336 --> 01:13:41,929
I'll talk to him, Mom.

800
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,669
You know, Dad...

801
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,326
...l've been thinking.

802
01:13:49,839 --> 01:13:51,213
Good talk.

803
01:13:56,814 --> 01:13:59,661
Aren't you a teeny bit sorry
we didn't get a Christmas tree?

804
01:13:59,757 --> 01:14:02,791
Even though they're dirty and messy
and corny and clichéd?

805
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:06,310
Where are you going to find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

806
01:14:24,841 --> 01:14:25,702
What's the matter?

807
01:14:27,913 --> 01:14:29,123
Was that really necessary?

808
01:14:31,529 --> 01:14:32,739
We needed a tree.

809
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:34,402
May I remind you that...

810
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:37,601
That this was all my idea?
No, no. I'm well aware of that.

811
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:41,508
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

812
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:44,864
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

813
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:48,541
We needed a coffin.

814
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:53,277
A tree. There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

815
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:57,443
Louis burned down my tree
so I replaced it as best I could. Voilà...

816
01:14:57,988 --> 01:14:59,165
Are you okay?

817
01:14:59,268 --> 01:15:00,795
I'm fine, honey.

818
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:25,977
I fixed the newel post.

819
01:15:48,093 --> 01:15:49,434
What's that sound?

820
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:11,733
Do you hear it?

821
01:16:12,696 --> 01:16:15,031
It's a funny, squeaking sound.

822
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:20,046
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

823
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:22,739
I hear it, too.

824
01:16:31,382 --> 01:16:32,364
I don't hear it anymore.

825
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:38,770
Squirrel!

826
01:16:46,228 --> 01:16:48,050
What was it? Oh, my God!

827
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,406
Quiet! Shut up!

828
01:17:08,528 --> 01:17:09,804
Mom, don't move.

829
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:14,247
We can't let it out of the living room.

830
01:17:15,376 --> 01:17:18,125
Where's Eddie?
He usually eats these goddamn things.

831
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:21,894
Not recently, Clark. He read that squirrels
were high in cholesterol.

832
01:17:23,086 --> 01:17:24,296
Thank you, Catherine.

833
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:26,918
I'll try and trap it.

834
01:17:27,085 --> 01:17:28,099
Russ!

835
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:29,315
We're here, Dad.

836
01:17:29,933 --> 01:17:30,915
There you are.

837
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:33,386
Go get the hammer.

838
01:17:33,644 --> 01:17:35,499
What do you need a hammer for?

839
01:17:35,724 --> 01:17:39,335
I'll catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

840
01:17:46,443 --> 01:17:47,969
I'm going in with him.

841
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:52,673
Nora?

842
01:17:56,137 --> 01:17:57,085
Is it gone?

843
01:17:57,161 --> 01:17:59,550
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

844
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:01,954
Squirrel!

845
01:18:39,106 --> 01:18:43,067
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

846
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:44,696
I can't just attack someone.

847
01:18:44,769 --> 01:18:48,827
All right, then. If you're not man enough
to put an end to this shit, then I am.

848
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:10,390
Gone.

849
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,235
Oh, my God.

850
01:19:20,283 --> 01:19:21,712
What happened to you?

851
01:19:34,106 --> 01:19:36,658
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

852
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:39,734
Nobody walks out
on this old-fashioned family Christmas.

853
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,102
No, we're all in this together.

854
01:19:42,425 --> 01:19:45,294
This is a full-blown,
four-alarm holiday emergency.

855
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,756
We're going to press on
and have the happiest Christmas...

856
01:19:48,919 --> 01:19:51,635
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny fucking Kaye.

857
01:19:51,702 --> 01:19:54,604
And when Santa squeezes
his fat, white ass down the chimney...

858
01:19:54,678 --> 01:19:58,507
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nuthouse.

859
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,887
You're goofy.

860
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:01,774
Don't piss me off, Art.

861
01:20:02,902 --> 01:20:05,868
- It's over.
- Not according to Santa's watch, it isn't.

862
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,150
Stay out of this, Dad.

863
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,187
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

864
01:20:10,516 --> 01:20:12,043
Before things get worse.

865
01:20:12,116 --> 01:20:14,985
Worse?! How could they get any worse?

866
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:19,048
Look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell!

867
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:37,284
Son.

868
01:20:39,055 --> 01:20:41,291
I love you. We all love you.

869
01:20:41,614 --> 01:20:44,963
But this is a terrible night.
Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

870
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:48,427
But losing your temper
only makes things worse.

871
01:20:48,654 --> 01:20:51,206
You're too good a father to act like this.

872
01:20:53,133 --> 01:20:57,606
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us...

873
01:20:57,868 --> 01:21:00,802
...and how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

874
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:02,915
You just cocked it up.

875
01:21:05,771 --> 01:21:08,007
It's okay. It happens.

876
01:21:10,026 --> 01:21:12,263
All our holidays were always such a mess.

877
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,973
How did you get through it?

878
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:18,719
I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels.

879
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:29,284
I love you.

880
01:21:33,703 --> 01:21:35,775
Will you recite
"The Night Before Christmas"?

881
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:38,083
No. It's your house.

882
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:39,835
It's your Christmas.

883
01:21:40,965 --> 01:21:42,492
I'm retiring.

884
01:21:43,814 --> 01:21:46,562
"The children were nestled
All snug in their beds

885
01:21:46,885 --> 01:21:49,753
"While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

886
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,769
"And Mama in her kerchief

887
01:21:51,844 --> 01:21:55,672
"And I in my cap, just settled our brains
For a long winter's nap

888
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:59,288
"When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter

889
01:21:59,395 --> 01:22:01,534
"I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

890
01:22:01,603 --> 01:22:03,642
"Away to the window I flew like a flash

891
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:06,046
"Tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash

892
01:22:06,241 --> 01:22:08,151
"The moon on the breast of
the new-fallen snow

893
01:22:08,225 --> 01:22:10,646
"Gave a luster of midday to objects below

894
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,053
"When what to my wondering eyes
should appear

895
01:22:13,153 --> 01:22:14,778
"But a miniature sleigh..."

896
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,277
...and Eddie.

897
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,152
And a man in his pajamas
with a dog chain...

898
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:22,653
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the...?

899
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:26,072
Stay here.

900
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:34,132
Merry Christmas, Clark.

901
01:22:35,357 --> 01:22:38,074
You about ready to do some kissin'?

902
01:22:39,676 --> 01:22:42,327
Officer, it seems
my husband has been abducted.

903
01:22:42,556 --> 01:22:46,068
The man was wearing a blue leisure suit...

904
01:22:47,515 --> 01:22:52,249
...and the plates were from Kansas.
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

905
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:54,806
I have never been treated
like this in my life.

906
01:22:55,033 --> 01:22:57,270
I'm sorry.
This is our family's first kidnapping.

907
01:22:58,266 --> 01:22:59,443
You're fired.

908
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,589
Where's the phone? I'm calling the police.

909
01:23:01,657 --> 01:23:03,566
Just hold your wad there, fella.

910
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:07,509
Clark had nothin' to do with this.
This here was my idea.

911
01:23:07,768 --> 01:23:11,183
All right. He's still fired
and you are going to jail.

912
01:23:12,952 --> 01:23:14,479
It was my fault.

913
01:23:15,511 --> 01:23:19,504
I lost my temper when I got my bonus
and I said a few things I shouldn't have.

914
01:23:19,671 --> 01:23:24,143
Bonus? How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

915
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:26,731
Thanks for telling us.

916
01:23:26,805 --> 01:23:30,001
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

917
01:23:30,548 --> 01:23:34,377
In 17 years with the company, I've gotten
a bonus every year, but this one.

918
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:36,562
You don't want to give bonuses, fine!

919
01:23:36,723 --> 01:23:38,992
When people count on them
as part of their salary...

920
01:23:39,219 --> 01:23:40,878
What you did just plain...

921
01:23:41,011 --> 01:23:42,026
Sucks.

922
01:23:43,826 --> 01:23:45,103
Thank you, Russ.

923
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:51,342
My cousin-in-law,
whose heart is bigger than his brain...

924
01:23:51,601 --> 01:23:53,094
I appreciate that.

925
01:23:54,384 --> 01:23:57,352
...is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this...

926
01:23:57,745 --> 01:24:01,573
...on behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

927
01:24:22,796 --> 01:24:25,579
Sometimes things look good
on paper, but...

928
01:24:25,837 --> 01:24:29,578
...lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

929
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,928
A healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much if...

930
01:24:33,003 --> 01:24:35,969
...to get it, you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

931
01:24:38,058 --> 01:24:42,368
It's people that make the difference.
Little people, like you.

932
01:24:44,873 --> 01:24:46,782
So, Carl...

933
01:24:48,456 --> 01:24:50,398
...whatever you got last year...

934
01:24:51,015 --> 01:24:53,251
...add 20 percent.

935
01:25:44,128 --> 01:25:46,037
Go away, Todd.

936
01:25:47,135 --> 01:25:51,476
If you want to come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

937
01:26:02,205 --> 01:26:05,237
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

938
01:26:16,283 --> 01:26:17,395
Freeze!

939
01:26:19,482 --> 01:26:21,237
Not you! Them!

940
01:26:30,681 --> 01:26:31,957
This way, please.

941
01:26:34,839 --> 01:26:36,694
I think you've made a terrible mistake.

942
01:26:37,015 --> 01:26:38,445
I told you to freeze, mister.

943
01:26:38,679 --> 01:26:39,857
May we blink?

944
01:26:46,358 --> 01:26:49,227
- Thank God you're all right.
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

945
01:26:49,557 --> 01:26:51,466
There was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

946
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:56,244
Excuse me. Would you and Mrs. Shirley
like to step outside so we can finish here?

947
01:26:57,237 --> 01:26:59,724
- Don't bother. I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

948
01:27:00,756 --> 01:27:01,999
It was a mistake.

949
01:27:02,067 --> 01:27:04,685
Mistake? Honey, you were kidnapped.

950
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:06,985
I did something I shouldn't have...

951
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:11,562
...and these people called me on it.
This is Clark Griswold and his family.

952
01:27:11,955 --> 01:27:13,383
Welcome to our home.

953
01:27:14,674 --> 01:27:16,015
What's left of it.

954
01:27:16,113 --> 01:27:17,422
Release B Squad.

955
01:27:17,713 --> 01:27:19,087
What's going on here?

956
01:27:19,313 --> 01:27:23,469
Remember how I was toying with the
notion of suspending Christmas bonuses?

957
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:25,389
You didn't.

958
01:27:25,648 --> 01:27:28,843
Of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

959
01:27:29,072 --> 01:27:30,446
That's pretty low, mister.

960
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:32,518
If I had a rubber hose...

961
01:27:32,591 --> 01:27:34,827
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating all the bonuses.

962
01:27:40,206 --> 01:27:41,798
Look!

963
01:27:44,109 --> 01:27:45,221
Look!

964
01:27:51,627 --> 01:27:53,221
It's Santy Claus.

965
01:27:56,907 --> 01:27:58,979
Uncle Clark, it's Santy Claus.

966
01:28:00,426 --> 01:28:02,052
It's the Christmas star.

967
01:28:02,506 --> 01:28:04,262
And that's all that matters tonight.

968
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:09,542
Not bonuses or gifts or turkeys or trees.

969
01:28:10,121 --> 01:28:11,397
See, kids...

970
01:28:12,361 --> 01:28:14,662
It means something different
to everybody.

971
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,563
Now I know what it means to me.

972
01:28:20,423 --> 01:28:22,660
That ain't the frigging Christmas star.

973
01:28:22,824 --> 01:28:25,856
It's the light
on the sewage treatment plant.

974
01:28:26,118 --> 01:28:27,394
Sewer gas.

975
01:28:29,318 --> 01:28:30,627
Don't drop that!

976
01:28:40,261 --> 01:28:42,649
"And the rocket's red glare

977
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,652
"The bombs bursting in air

978
01:28:47,395 --> 01:28:49,533
"Gave proof through the night

979
01:28:50,594 --> 01:28:53,943
"That our flag was still there

980
01:28:54,978 --> 01:28:57,050
"Oh, say does that

981
01:28:57,122 --> 01:29:01,529
"Star-spangled banner yet wave

982
01:29:03,776 --> 01:29:06,645
"O'er the land of the free

983
01:29:09,216 --> 01:29:13,044
"And the home of the brave?"

984
01:29:17,374 --> 01:29:18,901
Play ball!

985
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,562
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

986
01:29:29,532 --> 01:29:31,092
Merry Christmas, honey.

987
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,080
I did it.
