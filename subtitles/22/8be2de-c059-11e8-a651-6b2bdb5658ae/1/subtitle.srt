1
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:59,048
Yes!

2
00:01:00,753 --> 00:01:01,777
Open the gate

3
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,189
Open the container

4
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:45,717
What's so astonishing?

5
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:50,657
Where is the skull
of the dinosaur?

6
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:51,723
Dunno!

7
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,229
Speak up

8
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,196
Don't stand here!
Go search

9
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:56,596
Yes

10
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:57,868
Go

11
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,067
Backward, backward...

12
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:05,261
Slowly, be careful!

13
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:08,733
Come on... Be careful

14
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,466
Put the skull into the
other container

15
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,167
Get ready and set out now

16
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:13,403
Yes

17
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,042
Yee calling console, roger

18
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:19,473
Are you alright, Yee?

19
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:21,379
The skull of the dinosaur is ready

20
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,310
All the thieves were killed by me

21
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:24,177
Report your location

22
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,681
I am now in the Ta Nien

23
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:36,391
How dare you to kill
so many of my men!

24
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,097
You want to kill me
with this toy gun?

25
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:45,967
Kid, I'll show you
what a gun is!

26
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,042
Damn you,
you wasted one of my bullets

27
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:59,314
What else will you show me?

28
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:22,432
Yee, answer what
had happened!

29
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:23,606
Yee...

30
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:24,534
I am attacked

31
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,677
Which one attacked you?

32
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:28,205
I dunno, he is protected by helmet

33
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,142
And he has a golden gun

34
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,647
I've seen such powerful gun before

35
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,154
Send somebody to inform him

36
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:52,833
Yee, what's happened?

37
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,599
Answer now, Yee

38
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:08,414
Prime Minister, until now,

39
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:10,579
we haven't got any clue about the
missing of the dinosaur's skull

40
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,915
But the top spies of our organization

41
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,560
were almost killed

42
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,387
So, we meet some difficulties
during our investigation

43
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,999
This dinosaur's skull is the grade
one treasure of our country

44
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,199
No matter how,
you've to get it back

45
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:23,392
Yes, sir!

46
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,764
I'll try my best to get it back

47
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:26,632
Be hurry

48
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:27,898
Yes

49
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,768
Guard

50
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:34,503
Yes

51
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,408
What is that?

52
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,243
Report sir, these files
are over 10 years

53
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,645
I am going to burn it to ashes

54
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:40,484
Wait

55
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:41,711
Yes

56
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,791
Why the special file of
our spies is here?

57
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,690
This man's figure and IQ
is not qualified to be spy

58
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,223
He is a reservation

59
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:55,991
No, his ancestor was a hero

60
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,136
His background is clean,
he can be trusted

61
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:00,569
OK, send this guy to
take this mission

62
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,120
Don't you think that it's safe
for you to hide up right here?

63
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:36,884
It's useless, an attractive man
like you...

64
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,026
No matter where you hide,

65
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:40,222
you are always obvious

66
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,993
and outstanding!

67
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,994
Your blue eyes...

68
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,938
Your handsome look...

69
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,804
Your great skill in chopping...

70
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,935
And your glass of dry Martini...

71
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,413
They betray you!

72
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,216
But, although you are
so wonderful,

73
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:02,787
we have our own regulations,
no matter what,

74
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,283
you have to pay for what you
did last night

75
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,823
Why didn't pay me after hooking?

76
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,319
I think our relationship

77
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,223
is based on love

78
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:11,594
I can't imagine that,

79
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:13,688
it's just business

80
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,864
You need money before you love

81
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,093
I understand

82
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,630
If I had money,
I would have paid you

83
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:22,807
Vegetable is the latest craze,
poor business, you know?

84
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,044
Take the pork as a part
of the payment

85
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,111
Thank you

86
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,816
You are something!
We'll meet sooner or later

87
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,548
If you are interested,
why don't we meet tonight?

88
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:38,551
It won't be wasted!

89
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,091
What? That pork vendor didn't pay?

90
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:44,354
I will ask someone to
teach him a lesson

91
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:46,197
Forget it. By the way...

92
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,660
He is a very special

93
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,769
and handsome pork vendor

94
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,914
Han was a great hero

95
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,086
But time didn't give him chance...

96
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,688
Chai?

97
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,716
Man Si?

98
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:17,053
I hope you call my
full name: Da Mansi

99
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:18,594
Da Man Si

100
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:19,865
No problem, Man Si

101
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:20,893
Thank you

102
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:22,033
You're welcome, Man Si

103
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,566
We have a mission for you

104
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,037
Really?

105
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,505
They haven't forgotten me!

106
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:42,685
How are you, Rose?

107
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:45,715
We haven't met for 10 years,
you are still so pretty

108
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,318
I am not Rose

109
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,256
She died last year

110
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,023
I am her daughter, Rosy

111
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:53,587
She had a daughter!

112
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,431
Let uncle hug you

113
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:59,362
Later please, the Commander
is long waiting for you

114
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:01,840
Go in please

115
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,636
Alright, uncle will be back soon

116
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,106
Alright

117
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:10,372
Take this liver to make some soup

118
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:12,341
It's good to your health

119
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:16,446
You haven't been back for ages

120
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,613
Don't you remember there
is a glass door here?

121
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:33,970
Commander

122
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,037
Ling Ling Chai,
I'm glad you're bacs

123
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,197
Yes

124
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:39,302
Give me a cigarette, please

125
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:44,245
And knife please

126
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:46,146
Sorry

127
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,910
To be a swordsman,
I won't forget my weapon

128
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,145
Forget it

129
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:51,854
Swordsman?

130
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,022
I've waited for 10 years,
I think I was forgot by the country

131
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:56,786
No way, even a piece of toilet paper

132
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,226
is useful to us

133
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:00,487
This example fits!

134
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,790
I'm well prepared for any kind of work

135
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:07,897
Alright, I am glad you will
function at the right moment

136
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:09,973
Lately, we discovered the biggest

137
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,905
bones of an ancient dinosaur

138
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:14,542
But its skull is stolen

139
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:18,808
The thief is a very mysterious one

140
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,115
We just snow that he is using

141
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,119
an invincible golden gun

142
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,726
And he wears a super helmet

143
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,319
This invaluable treasure is
suspected to be stolen...

144
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,829
By Lai Yau-wai who is named
the King of Smuggling in Hong Kong

145
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,933
So, you are sent to Hong Kong
to investigate this case

146
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:37,625
Have you seen Rasic Park?

147
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:39,134
No, but I watched Jurassic Park

148
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,237
I see

149
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:42,431
Which kind of dinosaur is that?

150
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,439
Is that the one which screamed?

151
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:46,939
Right, the one which
screamed like this...

152
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,472
That one is so cruel,
it loved eating kids

153
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:51,343
No, the one in China
wouldn't eat kids

154
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:52,445
You're right

155
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:53,448
We send Da Mansi to support you,

156
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:56,110
who trained you 10 years ago

157
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:57,744
Mansi

158
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,224
Commander, I'm Da Mansi

159
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,362
Man Si, how is it going?

160
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,157
I invented some new product,

161
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:07,796
I hope it will help you

162
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:10,126
Torch?

163
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:12,770
No, this is not a common torch

164
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:15,597
It needs no batteries but a solar torch

165
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:17,799
When there is light,
it'll light up

166
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:19,502
But if there is no light,
will it light up too?

167
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:21,111
No! Never

168
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:23,273
But will it light up if there
is no light at all?

169
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,610
Good question,
turn off the light

170
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:27,015
Yes

171
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,454
Light it with another torch,

172
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,090
then it'll light up

173
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,619
See, isn't it?

174
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:36,752
Turn on the light

175
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:37,827
Yes

176
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,861
This invention is really creative

177
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,558
Look at the guard of that way

178
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,335
Suppose he is the man
with the golden gun

179
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,551
This is called "Super Spy's Chair"

180
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:12,692
This is for you to watch your
enemies for long duration

181
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:14,665
Are you scared or not?

182
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,596
Are you scared, right?

183
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:21,639
This is a powerful invention

184
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:22,801
Not bad

185
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:24,602
And I'm now trying to create

186
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,404
a super weapon,

187
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,312
which includes 10 kinds
of killing weapons

188
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,811
If this is successfully made...

189
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:33,509
Mansi, let's talk in my office

190
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,945
Chai, have you been pork vendor
in these 10 years?

191
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:37,813
Be exact,

192
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,082
a sad pork vendor

193
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:40,885
I am a sad vegetable hawker

194
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,425
Luckily, I've a part time job...

195
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,662
in the Central Psychological
Research Centre

196
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:46,658
What's your job?

197
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:47,890
To be researched!

198
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:51,993
Not bad

199
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,165
Ling Ling Chai, remember

200
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:58,203
The dinosaur's skull represents
the esteem of our country

201
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:00,671
It's not allowed to be
with the foreigners

202
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,876
During the investigation,
you've to keep secret

203
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,150
And, the man with a golden gun
is extremely mysterious

204
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,112
And he is so cruel

205
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:12,654
You will be very dangerous

206
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,925
Ling Ling Chai,
do you have any question?

207
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:16,156
May I be excused?

208
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,956
No way, you've to set out
tomorrow morning

209
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:21,662
When you reach Hong Kong,
someone will contact you

210
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:23,233
Yes

211
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:24,061
Anything else?

212
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:25,066
No

213
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:29,040
I'll sponsor $200 to you personally

214
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:31,340
Buy a better cloth before
you go to Hong Kong

215
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,375
Don't lose the face of our country

216
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:34,908
Mansi

217
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,242
Buy me a cup of tea

218
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:38,772
Remember to take back the change

219
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:40,745
Yes

220
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,753
Mansi, Commander,
I'll try my best for my country

221
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:46,117
Good speech, good pal

222
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,451
Good pal, good speech

223
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:48,722
Good

224
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,063
Are you crazy?

225
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:02,003
You use a pork vendor
to look for the dinosaur?

226
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:06,536
He was a very good spy

227
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,510
Don't you think I am a fool?

228
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:11,309
He hasn't been a spy for ages

229
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,542
He doesn't snow how to
shoot now, does he?

230
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:16,844
Deputy Captain, don't worry

231
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,959
I sent him for this mission,
I know his ability very well

232
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,630
Of course you know him

233
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,331
Only you know what's in your mind

234
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:34,734
I think, since the skull
is stolen in Zhen Yang,

235
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,636
it should be taken care
by the northern people

236
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:41,243
Anyway, you are not trusting me

237
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:43,672
Right, I am not trusting you

238
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,515
I've already sent my fellows

239
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,818
to investigate the case

240
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:50,717
Well, we needn't talk much

241
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,624
Please leave

242
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,286
This man will disappear
in this world now

243
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:30,994
Go to Hong Kong now

244
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:33,990
Send this document to a man
called Ling Ling Chai

245
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,261
Get a chance and kill him

246
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:03,147
Hong Kong

247
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,098
Hello

248
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:41,426
Can I help you, sir?

249
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,729
Yes! Well...
I've booked a room

250
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,362
What's your name?

251
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,161
My name is Ling Ling Chai

252
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,365
Hi

253
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:54,829
Sorry, your name isn't found here

254
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:57,107
What?

255
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,468
Please check it again

256
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,140
Sorry, you didn't book Regent Hotel

257
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,011
You booked Regent Motel

258
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,166
Boss,

259
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,463
you are so smart looking

260
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:27,832
I will charge you $70 only per day

261
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:29,769
Check out before 12 noon

262
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:42,345
Wear this, it'll be great

263
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:43,453
Really?

264
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:49,724
Is that alright?

265
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,694
Yes, but this doesn't fit me

266
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:53,728
Do you want any hooker?

267
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:54,831
Good idea, what kind of girls
are provided?

268
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,092
Mainlander or local girl,

269
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:57,326
just cost $150 each

270
00:22:59,271 --> 00:22:59,862
I want a local one

271
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:01,062
Alright

272
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:02,501
Auntie, what are you doing?

273
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,504
I am going to take off
your trousers

274
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:04,403
Why do you do that?

275
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:05,440
You want local girl, right?

276
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,668
I am famous in this zone

277
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,315
It's you!

278
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:53,086
So? Are you tailed?

279
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,024
Come to eat, hurry up

280
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,365
Come on, eat

281
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:16,945
Hi

282
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:31,788
So many pretty girls
in Hong Kong

283
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,327
You are so kind hearted

284
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:41,638
Do you always feed the dogs?

285
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:44,039
You love painting?

286
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,198
Yes, how about you?

287
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:46,907
I don't like it

288
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:48,535
I am a pork vendor

289
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:54,814
What song is it?

290
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:58,289
Li Heung Lan

291
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:00,450
By Jacky Cheung?

292
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,092
I know it, but not familiar with it

293
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:04,388
I know Li Heung Kam better

294
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:05,492
Really?

295
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:07,195
My name is Li Heung Kam

296
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:08,462
You are called Li Heung Kam?

297
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,060
Yes, I am Li Heung Kam

298
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:13,763
You are Li Heung Kam

299
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:17,301
So Li Heung Lan must be your mom

300
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,039
Yes, she is my mom

301
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:25,473
Li Heung Lan is your mom

302
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,019
Do you smoke?

303
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:31,185
No, what for?

304
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:32,414
Come out

305
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,155
Come out

306
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:39,792
Why there is a snipe?

307
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:41,029
The door of the cabinet
is not well closed

308
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,030
Obviously, there is a third
party hidden in

309
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:44,892
Step aside, it's really dangerous

310
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:46,267
Come out

311
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,366
Do you smoke Kent?

312
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:53,340
How do you know that?

313
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:55,038
This is dumped by you

314
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,246
Shit!

315
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,483
Come on, wear your shoes

316
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,415
After tasing heavy transportation,

317
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:09,086
I am a bit nervous

318
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:10,854
But I can say one word
without hesitation

319
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:12,628
I am a really great spy

320
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:14,890
Return the slippers to me please

321
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:19,793
To take this mission,

322
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:21,564
I am well prepared

323
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,805
For example, this is model F40

324
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:28,411
It seems to be a mobile phone

325
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:30,838
See, this platinum layer here?

326
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:32,074
In fact,

327
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:33,943
this is a shaver

328
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,647
It will benefit us...

329
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:38,914
To shave before going to
any sudden occasion

330
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:43,822
This is model 911
It seems to be a shaver

331
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:45,155
In fact...

332
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:48,630
It's a hair dryer

333
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:52,867
You needn't so many
hair dryers, need you?

334
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,472
This is a cover only

335
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,766
Let me tell you...

336
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:00,372
This is a shaver

337
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:02,301
See?

338
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:05,380
That's why you are so smart!

339
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:06,681
You're flattering me

340
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,687
If you lose this hair dryer,
what'll you do?

341
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,656
You can't give me any hard time!
I am a wise guy

342
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,025
In fact, what I am wearing...

343
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:19,523
are hair dryers too

344
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:24,292
You know, being a spy,

345
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:27,029
Outlook is very very important

346
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,304
Thank you

347
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,435
Do you have any battery?

348
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,138
It's out of battery

349
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,010
No

350
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:39,441
Forget it, I will handle it later

351
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:45,250
I wish to know that,

352
00:27:45,423 --> 00:27:47,414
being an excellent spy,
what gun do you use?

353
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,726
Can you show me?

354
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:53,193
What a shame, in fact
I don't know much about gun

355
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,097
I am good at...

356
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:56,392
Dagger!

357
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:57,635
Dagger?

358
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,167
Right, it's dagger

359
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,331
Spell, D A G G E R!

360
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:43,746
So wonderful

361
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:45,139
In fact...

362
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:46,977
I know, why not back to our topic

363
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:52,145
Being a spy,

364
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,048
you've to know something about gun

365
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:57,522
This is called UFO Rifle,
it's suitable for long ranged shooting

366
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:58,787
The range is 200 meters

367
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,993
This is 224 tiny spittoon bullet,

368
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,758
it's specially made for me

369
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:04,566
I love this name

370
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:06,267
357 Magnum

371
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:06,835
So great!

372
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:08,165
It's together with steel shot bullets

373
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:09,899
Can it kill a dinosaur?

374
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:13,037
You have to try it
with a real dinosaur

375
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:19,443
China made PPK,
its used by mainland spies

376
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:20,706
The range is 120 meters

377
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,108
But it's too noisy

378
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,879
With this,

379
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,316
you can kill without noise

380
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:37,866
What's stucked inside?

381
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:40,895
I think cotton

382
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:43,535
So simple?

383
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:45,771
How about toilet paper?

384
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,509
You are smart and
you are humourous

385
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:53,579
I can't see anything inside

386
00:29:58,756 --> 00:29:59,688
It's cute

387
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:02,921
Does this fit?

388
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:06,922
Mine fits too

389
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:08,899
May I try?

390
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:11,395
Alright, how?

391
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:14,264
It's raining, let me close
the window first

392
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:30,017
What's up?
Why are you shot?

393
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:31,681
I am trying to test this gun

394
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,987
This gun shoot towards the back!

395
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:35,050
Why didn't you inform me earlier?

396
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,853
You are bleeding
Wait for me

397
00:30:46,437 --> 00:30:47,165
What are you doing?

398
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,498
I am testing this gun, too

399
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:49,367
Are you shot?

400
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,564
Why didn't you tell me
before testing?

401
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,103
This gun is named "Nicked Gun"

402
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,968
It shoots backward first,
then forward!

403
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:56,711
Why didn't you tell me first?

404
00:30:57,382 --> 00:30:59,680
You are bleeding,
cover it first

405
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:22,237
Kam, why are you sweating?

406
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:23,574
I am bathing

407
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:25,234
Where is Ling Ling Chai?

408
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,972
He is still here,
but don't worry

409
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:28,476
I will finish my mission soon

410
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:30,212
No, now the plan is changed

411
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:33,050
Kill him in Lai Yau Wai's home

412
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:35,952
So we can set Lai up

413
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,614
And no one would suspect
that is done by us

414
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,916
Wait one more day

415
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:41,619
You want me to wait another day?

416
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:44,319
Why are you bleeding?

417
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,956
Nothing, I have brushed my teeth

418
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:48,060
This is the blood of the gum

419
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,297
What kind of teeth brush
you are using?

420
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,362
Broom?

421
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,101
How are you?

422
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:55,764
Hi, Ling Ling Chai

423
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:59,338
Commander

424
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,477
I am glad to see you
in the toilet

425
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:02,779
How is your co-operation?

426
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:05,845
Not bad, Kam is nice

427
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:06,949
She is a good friend of mine

428
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:09,052
Kam, what do you think about me?

429
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,011
Other than your smart look,
I've nothing else to say

430
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:12,679
There is something else,
you may know it later

431
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:14,651
Hope you would finish
your mission soon

432
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:15,986
Yes. Got you

433
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,359
Kam, take back your gun first

434
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,364
Thank you

435
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:28,368
Don't move, let me help you

436
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:30,097
Save this for yourself

437
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:31,764
I am fine, thank you

438
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,567
I tell you, never test the guns alone

439
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:39,842
I love it, so what?

440
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:49,124
Waiter

441
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:50,021
Yes

442
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:51,987
I've heard that the bean cube
pudding is famous here

443
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:52,925
Sure

444
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:53,859
It stinks!

445
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:55,124
It's famous for its stinks!

446
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:58,499
Can you bring me another one
which is famous for it's delicious?

447
00:32:59,303 --> 00:32:59,997
I'll bring you bean cube
pudding, too!

448
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:00,865
Is that true?

449
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,869
True!

450
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,302
Imagine this is stink bean cube

451
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:04,869
So, it'll be perfect

452
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,446
Give me some deep fried ones

453
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:15,019
The Hong Kong shopping
centres are so wonderful!

454
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:16,081
Yeah

455
00:33:17,822 --> 00:33:18,846
How is your wound?

456
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,714
No big deal

457
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:23,791
Never test the guns which
you don't know

458
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:26,553
I should have learnt playing
dagger from you

459
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:30,032
I dare not be your teacher,
but I tell you

460
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:32,636
The real dagger
is not played by hands

461
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,237
Guess what

462
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:36,266
Air

463
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,700
Use the air to govern your dagger

464
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:42,812
So, nothing can't be chopped

465
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:46,045
Don't you believe,

466
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:46,979
I will show you with this knife

467
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,982
It's alright, come and eat

468
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:52,718
Kam, are you still mad at me?

469
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:54,883
Don't be silly

470
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,526
What made you think
I am not mad at you?

471
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:57,886
I am very mad at you

472
00:33:58,196 --> 00:33:59,959
Kidding? How angry are you?

473
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,093
I would like to
shoot you to death

474
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:09,801
Kid, why are you
taking our picture?

475
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:10,770
Calm down

476
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:12,773
I can tell you are artists

477
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:14,741
I am trying to find some

478
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,038
sources about love

479
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:16,771
From your eyes,

480
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,176
I can tell you two are lovers

481
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,381
So, I can't help taking
your pictures,

482
00:34:20,818 --> 00:34:21,807
hope you don't mind

483
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,659
So, take back the pictures

484
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,472
I will keep this one, thank you

485
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,767
I am sorry

486
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:48,538
Don't mention it, take it

487
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:58,846
Mister, did you spit it?

488
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,684
Yes, anything wrong?

489
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:03,190
Nothing, I just want to know...

490
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,462
From your words,
are you coming from Hunan?

491
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:07,794
Yeah

492
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:10,425
I came from Hunan too.
Which district are you from?

493
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:11,861
Cho Tao District

494
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:13,233
Me too

495
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:15,405
What a coincidence!
Which village?

496
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:16,631
Shang Yang Village

497
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,376
What a coincidence!
We are from Shang Yang Village too

498
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:20,568
Really?

499
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,402
We meet our neighbour here!

500
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:23,441
Give way please

501
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:27,144
A dog always barsed near
the entrance of our village

502
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:31,254
I kept that dog,
but it disappeared at last

503
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,549
And I found out that it was eaten

504
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,522
That heartless bastard dumped

505
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:38,059
its bones at the entrance of the village!

506
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:41,125
Did you do that cruel thing?

507
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,358
No, no...

508
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:44,466
Why your cheek turns red?

509
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:46,296
No, not red

510
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,459
Your smile is so embarrassing

511
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:48,969
Not embarrassing...

512
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,432
I suspected that it was done by you

513
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,632
No...

514
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:52,465
Is that done by you?

515
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:53,234
No... No

516
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:54,036
Not you?

517
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:54,769
No, not me

518
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:55,742
- Not you?
- No

519
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:56,811
- Was it done by you?
- No

520
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:57,705
Thank you

521
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:02,216
Don't mention it, just a meal...

522
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,814
By the way

523
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:06,554
We Hunan people can't be despised

524
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:10,060
When we go back to our hometown,
we'd be rich and famous

525
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:14,027
I won't bother you then

526
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:15,831
If we meet again...

527
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,092
I will treat you breakfast

528
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:18,366
See you

529
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,467
Wait

530
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:25,707
Well, wait a minute

531
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:27,844
Two of my friends are going
to take something

532
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:28,876
They will return soon

533
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:29,910
Let's wait for them and
shop around, alright?

534
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:31,708
Thank you so much,
we have something to do

535
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,509
Never mind

536
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:34,616
It's hard to get a chance
to meet your old friends

537
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:35,843
Have a chat,
and I'd like to go to toilet

538
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,948
That's good

539
00:36:56,974 --> 00:36:58,805
Shut up, I just say once

540
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:00,507
Got it?

541
00:37:12,757 --> 00:37:15,123
You are so smart among
the Hunan people

542
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:22,727
I know you mind your
outlook very much

543
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:26,629
In fact, if you forget your hat,
you'll look more handsome

544
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:28,829
Don't wear hats so often

545
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:31,407
I loved wearing hats

546
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:32,607
But someone told me

547
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:33,709
the hat makes the hair feel stuffy

548
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,641
so it's easy to let me
become bald head

549
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:38,009
What bothers them?

550
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:40,673
They just have to take something only!

551
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:46,787
How is it? Kid

552
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:48,721
Are you still angry with dad?

553
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,318
You always fool me,

554
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:51,855
and I just fooled you once

555
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:57,231
Alright, I am going to buy you
some pop corn then

556
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,528
Really? Let's go now

557
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:00,636
You fool me again! Bastard!

558
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:01,794
I wanna beat you!

559
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:07,203
It hurts

560
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:14,449
I asked you not to shout!

561
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,025
You are back!

562
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:32,697
I want to beat you to death!

563
00:38:36,073 --> 00:38:37,631
Police, freeze!

564
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,046
Don't move

565
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:48,981
We are neighbours

566
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:50,177
please help me

567
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:52,013
Don't come over

568
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:53,247
Bastard!

569
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:56,756
How are you?

570
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:58,153
Calling console, calling console

571
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:00,229
Send ambulance here,
many people are shot

572
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:02,263
Here is the 4th floor of
Royal Castle, over

573
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:12,198
Go away, or I'll kill

574
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:19,543
Tak... Tak...

575
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:20,843
Go away

576
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:23,486
Give my son back to me, I beg you

577
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:28,080
Get lost...

578
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:30,659
I've this only son,
I beg you

579
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:33,419
Get lost

580
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:35,358
Give my son back to me...

581
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:55,951
Watch him and I've controlled this place

582
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:58,786
Freeze

583
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:13,036
Let's go

584
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:29,310
Hung, hurry up

585
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:34,916
Hung, be quick

586
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:40,789
Hung...

587
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,290
Hurry, leave the scene

588
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:15,560
They're coming down,
be careful

589
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:32,610
Vaudeville?

590
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:43,516
I thought I could kill

591
00:41:43,694 --> 00:41:44,854
with somebody's hand

592
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:47,694
But the plan failed

593
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:49,089
Have you received my order?

594
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,665
How can you make your
own decision?

595
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:55,094
I know!

596
00:41:55,272 --> 00:41:57,001
I do hope to understand Chai

597
00:41:57,174 --> 00:41:58,163
Shut up

598
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:00,107
Who do you think you're
to raise this question?

599
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,542
What is he, that's none
of your business

600
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:07,212
Remember, your mom &
dad were betrayers

601
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:08,373
Your grandpa was a traitor

602
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:10,543
So you're a traitor

603
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:13,087
It's fate

604
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:14,619
If I didn't let you stay with me,

605
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:16,926
you would have been
executed with them

606
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:19,328
Your life is mine

607
00:42:19,763 --> 00:42:21,492
So you'd obey my order

608
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:22,990
Is that clear?

609
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:31,997
Kam I know you may
be kind-hearted

610
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,905
You know what he is now?

611
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:37,240
He's a beast

612
00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:39,581
He was a nasty guy

613
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:43,913
Raped the pregnant woman
& the little girls

614
00:42:45,255 --> 00:42:47,587
Look, the girls and so small

615
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,687
These pregnant women are big

616
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,556
They were dragged
to death by Chai

617
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,493
Not only for me

618
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:56,762
But also for the public

619
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,062
Any questions?

620
00:42:58,235 --> 00:42:59,133
No

621
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:01,734
OK, let's do as our plan

622
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:03,668
Kill him in Lai Yau Wai's home

623
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:04,899
Got it

624
00:43:18,188 --> 00:43:19,177
Are you alright?

625
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:20,317
What does that mean?

626
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:23,255
Nothing, I think, you've
locked up for a long time,

627
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:24,619
and you didn't answer me

628
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:26,660
That's why I just broke in
and watched

629
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:29,093
Are you bathing?

630
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:30,861
Yes, I'm fine

631
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:32,133
Please close the door

632
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,569
I can't imagine that'd happened

633
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,903
I said, get out & close the door

634
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:42,744
Yes... well... I'm sorry...

635
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:46,405
Get out!

636
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:51,513
What do you want?

637
00:43:51,689 --> 00:43:52,314
Give it or not?

638
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:53,148
What?

639
00:43:53,323 --> 00:43:54,051
Money for the dead

640
00:43:54,224 --> 00:43:54,918
For the dead?

641
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:55,751
Tak's dad

642
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:56,688
Who's Tak's dad?

643
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,885
The innocent one who was shot
dead in the shopping centre

644
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,094
Donate money for the dead?

645
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:02,197
Can we give Tak's family

646
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:03,560
through the press?

647
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:04,763
Maybe

648
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:07,361
What name should we write?
The kind-hearted guys?

649
00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:08,834
Up to you

650
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,873
Since we're not close friends!

651
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,975
Just donate $500, that's enough

652
00:44:13,877 --> 00:44:14,775
Up to you

653
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:16,510
Can you pay that $500 for me?

654
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,738
What?

655
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:19,811
When I finish the mission,
I'll be awarded $500

656
00:44:19,983 --> 00:44:20,847
So I can pay you back

657
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:21,950
What?

658
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:24,644
Trust me! I won't forget my words

659
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:28,523
Alright

660
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:24,638
Put it properly...

661
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:27,409
Go... again

662
00:45:28,085 --> 00:45:31,020
Again

663
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:33,313
This is dangerous explosive

664
00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:35,889
Watch this day & night

665
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:36,989
Yes

666
00:45:50,474 --> 00:45:52,271
Lai Yau Wai always deals
with smuggling

667
00:45:52,442 --> 00:45:54,535
The lost cranium of dinosaur
may be related to him

668
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:55,837
That's him

669
00:45:56,013 --> 00:45:57,105
Take action when there's
a chance

670
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:58,248
Any more questions?

671
00:45:58,582 --> 00:46:02,348
Yes, is Lee Heung Lan
your mom?

672
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:05,079
As I know, she's a traitor

673
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:09,120
Sorry, I've no question

674
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:10,760
Time's up. Let's go

675
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:14,287
Kam, if we finish the
mission tonight

676
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:15,294
I'll return at once

677
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:16,193
So, tell me what you like

678
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:17,333
I'll send it to you

679
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:18,032
No, thanks

680
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:19,100
I've to send you a gift!

681
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:20,201
White roses

682
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,300
You're very romantic

683
00:46:22,873 --> 00:46:23,805
Maybe, I'll send it to you

684
00:46:23,974 --> 00:46:25,464
Very romantic

685
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:29,435
If we've time,

686
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,006
I'd like to visit the karaoke
in Hong Kong

687
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:33,940
I'll keep contact with you

688
00:46:35,152 --> 00:46:35,914
You know,

689
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:38,350
my voice is like Jacky Cheung

690
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:40,012
My Adam's apple can
move up & down!

691
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,054
This is the key of the rear door

692
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:42,283
Hurry up, or you'll have no time

693
00:46:43,126 --> 00:46:43,956
I'll sing you a song

694
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:45,522
Why not "Lee Heung Lan"?

695
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:46,827
I tell you,

696
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:48,562
I'm forced to stay with you

697
00:46:48,732 --> 00:46:50,131
Don't mention Lee Heung Lan
in front of me

698
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,232
Don't sing in front of me

699
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:53,096
I don't want to hear your bull shit!

700
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:58,935
I appreciate your straight character!

701
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,637
This key is not important to me

702
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:05,878
This is not a simple box

703
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:07,914
This is a special box
called "Magic Box"

704
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:09,609
It can send me

705
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,219
to Lai's home safely
& beautifully

706
00:47:13,857 --> 00:47:19,762
Magic Box!

707
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,328
Why are you here?
What do you want?

708
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:26,635
I'd ask you that question!

709
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,068
Oh shit!

710
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:29,196
I haven't adjusted the angle

711
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:30,738
So, wrong direction

712
00:47:31,775 --> 00:47:32,571
Now, it's OK

713
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:37,169
Magic... Shit!

714
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:43,415
The door is opened. Go in

715
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:47,286
Kam, I am not fool...

716
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:48,321
Clean the blood first

717
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:49,686
Alright

718
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:52,522
I think this box
is wrongly positioned!

719
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:53,863
Adjust it, that'll be alright

720
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:57,893
Don't waste my time!

721
00:47:58,068 --> 00:47:59,626
It'll be alright!
Give me one more chance

722
00:48:01,371 --> 00:48:06,434
Magic Box...

723
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:20,920
Excuse me,
Dry Martini please

724
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,095
What're you looking?
Give me another glass

725
00:48:33,403 --> 00:48:36,304
That's too much!
What're you looking?

726
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,401
Chai, how is it going?

727
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:46,348
Dangerous!
The guests look so nasty!

728
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:47,710
But very kind!

729
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,215
You won't understand!

730
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:52,210
Sir, how about you?

731
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:54,420
I'll take care myself, thanks

732
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,002
Mr Lai, your call!

733
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,229
Hello?

734
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:22,018
Target discovered

735
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,030
Pay attention, the cranium...

736
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,304
Listen, I'll say once more

737
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:49,370
Put the bones into hot water
to remove extra fats

738
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:51,878
That cook it with fish
snout for an hour

739
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:53,209
When will you come back
for the soup?

740
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:57,543
Cut the crap!
My wife is inside

741
00:49:58,021 --> 00:49:58,783
Romario sent it to Pai Bi-to

742
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,047
Pai Bi-to scored with

743
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:02,282
his wonderful skill

744
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:08,427
Chai, how is it?
Can't you listen?

745
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:11,900
We believed that a man called

746
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:13,798
Pai Bi-to stole the cranium

747
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:16,034
Then he used his
personal skills...

748
00:50:16,206 --> 00:50:17,468
Shoot & score one mark

749
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,168
But the signal is weak here

750
00:50:19,943 --> 00:50:21,672
I'm planning to dig a tunnel

751
00:50:21,845 --> 00:50:22,709
towards his sofa

752
00:50:22,879 --> 00:50:24,107
And to hear what he'll say

753
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:26,546
Chai, cut the crap!

754
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:28,646
Go to some place else
which receives better

755
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,985
Kam, radio receiver is
being disturbed there

756
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:33,119
I can't hear

757
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,655
the words of Lai Yau Wai

758
00:50:38,261 --> 00:50:39,057
Chat

759
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:41,296
try a place which is not crowded

760
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:44,229
In front of me

761
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:45,425
there is a piano only

762
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,299
Go & try

763
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:53,105
Alright

764
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:05,314
Not clear at all

765
00:51:05,822 --> 00:51:08,313
Don't move, sit well

766
00:51:10,227 --> 00:51:11,159
Right

767
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,960
I feel embarrass
to sit here alone

768
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:17,699
You love singing songs?

769
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:18,892
Sing

770
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:21,798
Alright!

771
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:53,834
I forgot the lyrics

772
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:52,727
How is it?

773
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:54,395
Normal, not special

774
00:52:54,864 --> 00:52:56,832
Like Jacky Cheung or not?

775
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,100
Fair!

776
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:11,345
You're really great!

777
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:18,687
You're great to change position
in such short time!

778
00:53:18,855 --> 00:53:21,255
You're somebody, I guess

779
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:22,857
Be frank

780
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,892
I'm waiting for a very
important man

781
00:53:26,396 --> 00:53:28,364
I think, you know him too

782
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:33,800
Sorry, no comment

783
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:36,469
I won't force others

784
00:53:37,073 --> 00:53:39,166
But I've something to tell you

785
00:53:39,976 --> 00:53:41,568
I really appreciate you

786
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,168
I love you

787
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:58,384
Got it? Here is very dangerous

788
00:54:58,722 --> 00:55:00,121
I don't know where
the killers are hiding!

789
00:55:19,743 --> 00:55:21,040
Will that be so beneficial?

790
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:02,716
I was shot

791
00:56:05,455 --> 00:56:06,945
How can you walk freely then?

792
00:56:08,425 --> 00:56:09,653
Luckily I've put on
bullet-proof vest

793
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,257
But no bullet-proof trousers

794
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:21,192
This is for you

795
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:24,166
Where do you get it from?

796
00:56:24,774 --> 00:56:26,173
I got it while I was escaping!

797
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:28,640
This is rare!
You're really lucky

798
00:56:40,657 --> 00:56:43,148
Don't be so serious! Nuts!

799
00:56:43,827 --> 00:56:46,352
How do you know that?
Many people say so

800
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,127
The killers of the Man
with a Golden Gun are inside

801
00:56:48,298 --> 00:56:49,356
Go now

802
00:56:54,737 --> 00:56:55,567
Who is he?

803
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:05,404
I'm here, don't worry

804
00:57:06,816 --> 00:57:07,646
Cripple, sit here

805
00:57:07,817 --> 00:57:08,784
Let me handle it

806
00:57:17,927 --> 00:57:19,292
Bump him to death

807
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:30,064
You're lucky to escape!

808
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:49,588
How are you?

809
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,192
Bandage and cotton,
any scissors?

810
00:58:01,404 --> 00:58:02,336
Yes

811
00:58:15,218 --> 00:58:15,980
I can't get any scissors

812
00:58:16,286 --> 00:58:17,048
Forget it

813
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:22,790
The bullet is shot into
the bone of my thigh

814
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,758
And it's pressing my artery

815
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:26,628
which locates near the trigeminal

816
00:58:27,897 --> 00:58:29,797
My left brain is lacking oxygen

817
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,460
And the right part of my body
is starting to be palsy

818
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,004
I've to cut the wound and
take out the bullet

819
00:58:41,077 --> 00:58:42,237
Let me do it

820
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,817
This is a famous knife

821
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,717
which is used by a famous smith

822
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,585
It's made by special iron

823
00:58:56,192 --> 00:58:58,990
Net weight 40 catties
16 tales and 4 oz

824
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:00,853
It's not easy to be taken
by ordinary people

825
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,294
It needs special skill

826
00:59:06,102 --> 00:59:08,036
In order not to contact
the nerves and vessels,

827
00:59:09,272 --> 00:59:10,330
help me to widen the wound

828
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:12,638
Hold it

829
00:59:13,443 --> 00:59:14,307
I can stand it

830
00:59:15,645 --> 00:59:16,669
Can't you see the bullet?

831
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,508
The black one?

832
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,706
No, that's trash

833
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:21,941
Higher

834
00:59:22,485 --> 00:59:23,008
The white one?

835
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:24,210
That's bone

836
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:25,911
The silver one is the bullet

837
00:59:26,923 --> 00:59:27,514
I see it

838
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:28,748
It's clipped deep inside

839
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:33,426
Dig it out

840
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:34,555
What?

841
00:59:34,964 --> 00:59:35,862
Go ahead

842
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:36,894
Like this?

843
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:38,165
Yes

844
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:39,431
Do you need anesthetic?

845
00:59:40,036 --> 00:59:40,695
Yes

846
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:43,737
Turn on the video

847
00:59:49,646 --> 00:59:50,237
Have you put a wrong tape?

848
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:54,008
No, this is called
"Shifting attention"

849
00:59:54,317 --> 00:59:55,648
You mean it's the stance of making love?

850
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:56,978
You want to cheat me?

851
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,951
I mean this is the way
I use as anesthetic!

852
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:02,023
Have you read the story of Wah Tor,
the greatest doctor of China

853
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:05,219
Once Kwan Wan Cheung

854
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:07,829
was playing chess during an operation

855
01:00:08,531 --> 01:00:10,465
Now, I am going to
watch blue tape

856
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:12,394
under an operation too

857
01:00:12,869 --> 01:00:13,699
Go ahead

858
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:17,006
Watch it later

859
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,302
Alright

860
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:28,517
The bullet is too close
to the bone,

861
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:29,617
nerves are around

862
01:00:29,786 --> 01:00:30,810
It hurts, hold it

863
01:00:30,987 --> 01:00:31,976
Black too?

864
01:00:39,462 --> 01:00:40,360
Why do you stop?

865
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:44,962
I want my blood to concentrate
to one part intentionally

866
01:00:45,134 --> 01:00:46,499
I don't want to lose
much blood

867
01:00:46,836 --> 01:00:48,235
Forget it, just go ahead

868
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:49,929
It's blocking my operation

869
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:51,164
Why don't you move it aside?

870
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:55,370
Yeah! Come on

871
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:57,809
Use more force...

872
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,277
What? Do you feel pain?

873
01:01:00,016 --> 01:01:00,778
I am not talking to you

874
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,417
I am talking to the darkie

875
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:04,249
Sorry... Sorry

876
01:01:05,521 --> 01:01:06,317
So much blood

877
01:01:07,757 --> 01:01:09,520
You broke a vessel

878
01:01:09,692 --> 01:01:10,681
What'll I do?

879
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:13,392
Go on watching the tape

880
01:01:28,711 --> 01:01:29,678
Can you hold it?

881
01:01:31,514 --> 01:01:33,778
Chat with me,
ask me some questions

882
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:35,873
Don't let me sleep

883
01:01:36,252 --> 01:01:38,345
I am afraid I won't wake up
after sleeping

884
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:42,113
What's your name?

885
01:01:42,859 --> 01:01:43,951
I am called Ling Ling Chai

886
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:45,987
You may ask some
difficult questions

887
01:01:47,463 --> 01:01:48,452
Difficult?

888
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:52,933
There is a farm, the number of
chicken is 4 times of the ducks

889
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:55,635
The quantity of ducks is 9
less than the quantity of pigs

890
01:01:56,205 --> 01:01:58,366
The total quantity of
pigs and ducks is 67

891
01:01:58,775 --> 01:02:01,243
How many legs do the animals

892
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,434
in the farm have?

893
01:02:03,146 --> 01:02:04,044
Let me ask you

894
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:05,909
Alright

895
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,283
Who is the man and
the woman of the picture?

896
01:02:16,225 --> 01:02:17,283
My parents

897
01:02:18,094 --> 01:02:19,220
Why can't we see their face?

898
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,164
When I was small, they died

899
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:24,693
so I don't have much memory

900
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:27,228
Oh, I'm sorry

901
01:02:28,004 --> 01:02:29,335
We are orphans

902
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:31,296
that's why we can
make friends with each other

903
01:02:32,942 --> 01:02:33,738
Kim

904
01:02:36,779 --> 01:02:37,803
Thank you

905
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:42,908
Don't mention it

906
01:02:43,419 --> 01:02:44,647
Hold it, don't die

907
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:49,852
Can you turn off
the air condition?

908
01:02:50,026 --> 01:02:51,152
I feel cold

909
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:55,080
Chai

910
01:03:58,127 --> 01:04:02,223
Chai...

911
01:04:02,598 --> 01:04:04,031
Luckily, I've practised
Chinese Therapy

912
01:04:07,203 --> 01:04:08,602
But about disinfection
and stop bleeding...

913
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,332
This is so wonderful!

914
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:37,424
.224 Tiny Spittoon Bullet?

915
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,433
It's only used by you

916
01:04:41,304 --> 01:04:43,397
Where is your UFO Rifle?

917
01:04:44,674 --> 01:04:46,335
It must be put on the car outside?

918
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:55,782
In fact, it's you who shot me

919
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,658
Since you have to kill me,
why did you save me?

920
01:05:15,805 --> 01:05:17,363
What's the relationship between
you and the man with a golden gun?

921
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,269
You needn't ask,
I won't tell anything

922
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:21,103
Being a spy,
I can't kill you,

923
01:05:21,577 --> 01:05:22,635
so there is only one result

924
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:23,741
Come on

925
01:05:36,025 --> 01:05:36,719
Alright

926
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:45,155
You can't make it in
such a short distance!

927
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:48,263
Poor aiming

928
01:05:51,474 --> 01:05:52,372
I can't help

929
01:05:58,381 --> 01:06:00,076
About killing and fighting,
don't bother me anymore

930
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:01,609
I'd better watch my tape

931
01:06:14,196 --> 01:06:15,322
Just pretend that
I've never seen you

932
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,782
Chai, don't go,
you can't go back

933
01:06:41,223 --> 01:06:42,485
Commander is the man
with the golden gun

934
01:06:42,658 --> 01:06:43,989
The dinosaur's...

935
01:06:45,995 --> 01:06:47,087
Why are you taller?

936
01:06:48,697 --> 01:06:50,688
You told the truth at last

937
01:06:56,238 --> 01:06:58,103
You look thinner!

938
01:06:58,574 --> 01:07:01,509
It's not easy to be a betrayer, isn't it?

939
01:07:11,654 --> 01:07:13,781
Miss, do you have any plaster?

940
01:07:13,956 --> 01:07:15,924
You look so lovely

941
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:19,053
I know why Commander Chan
was killed by you now

942
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:20,795
I want to see your Commander

943
01:07:20,963 --> 01:07:22,760
Please show me the way

944
01:07:39,381 --> 01:07:42,009
You know, Siu Kam
betrayed our country

945
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:45,542
I don't know

946
01:07:45,888 --> 01:07:48,288
Our country trusts her
so much and she...

947
01:07:48,557 --> 01:07:49,717
Who beat you up?

948
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:51,519
I think it's done by the man
with a golden gun

949
01:07:51,894 --> 01:07:53,418
Where is Siu Kam?
Where is she?

950
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:54,756
I don't know, she's lost

951
01:07:56,999 --> 01:07:57,693
So careless!

952
01:07:57,867 --> 01:08:00,665
The enemy is too cunning,
they appear everywhere!

953
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,268
How is your wound?

954
01:08:03,439 --> 01:08:04,565
It'll be alright

955
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,367
You are bleeding!

956
01:08:07,176 --> 01:08:10,270
Sign this, and go to the hospital
for treatment

957
01:08:10,813 --> 01:08:11,643
It's urgent!

958
01:08:11,814 --> 01:08:12,712
Guard. Yes

959
01:08:12,882 --> 01:08:13,712
Send him to the hospital now

960
01:08:13,883 --> 01:08:16,044
You needn't worry much

961
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,916
This way, please

962
01:08:48,317 --> 01:08:49,682
What are you looking,
come on

963
01:08:49,985 --> 01:08:50,917
We are waiting for you

964
01:08:51,887 --> 01:08:52,876
Why an execution now?

965
01:08:53,656 --> 01:08:54,350
Let's choose some other ways

966
01:08:54,523 --> 01:08:55,683
No, we have arrived

967
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:03,227
So serious!

968
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:06,666
What's the matter?

969
01:09:07,002 --> 01:09:07,866
Nothing

970
01:09:08,237 --> 01:09:09,499
You mean nothing?

971
01:09:09,872 --> 01:09:10,736
I am in trouble now

972
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,767
Don't move

973
01:09:13,842 --> 01:09:14,831
If anything happens,
tell me clearly first

974
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:15,908
Go

975
01:09:16,378 --> 01:09:20,280
Ling Ling Chai, you signed and
you admitted that you're a betrayer

976
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:22,981
You stole our country's treasure
which deserves a capital punishment

977
01:09:23,552 --> 01:09:24,678
You'll be executed now

978
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:30,254
Go back

979
01:09:31,493 --> 01:09:32,653
Wait, I am innocent...

980
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:34,056
Wait, I am innocent...

981
01:09:34,563 --> 01:09:36,053
I didn't see any
national confidential

982
01:09:36,732 --> 01:09:38,893
You should have conscience!

983
01:09:40,035 --> 01:09:41,593
Everybody knows
I am a blind man

984
01:09:42,705 --> 01:09:44,172
You framed a blind

985
01:09:44,506 --> 01:09:46,974
to read national confidential
unlawfully?

986
01:09:52,715 --> 01:09:54,876
Pal, I am a good friend
of Commissioner Chan

987
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:55,846
I always have meals
together with him

988
01:09:56,018 --> 01:09:59,249
- Wait...
- Wait...

989
01:10:00,556 --> 01:10:01,784
My dad is Commissioner Chan

990
01:10:01,957 --> 01:10:03,822
If you kill me,
I will ask him to kill you

991
01:10:03,993 --> 01:10:05,119
Ready

992
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:11,328
No... no

993
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:15,528
I am so smart

994
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:20,041
I don't want to die

995
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:28,044
No, no...

996
01:10:32,921 --> 01:10:33,819
Damn!

997
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:35,479
What an ugly face!

998
01:10:36,959 --> 01:10:38,119
So ugly!

999
01:10:40,663 --> 01:10:41,129
Good shot

1000
01:10:41,297 --> 01:10:42,457
Yeah!

1001
01:10:48,704 --> 01:10:49,568
Next

1002
01:11:01,784 --> 01:11:03,183
My 30 year's practice

1003
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:05,484
is useful now

1004
01:11:07,256 --> 01:11:08,052
Get ready

1005
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,794
Do you want to kill
a martial arts hero as me?

1006
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:15,127
Not that easy

1007
01:11:43,692 --> 01:11:44,659
Ready

1008
01:11:51,567 --> 01:11:52,556
Execution now

1009
01:11:57,406 --> 01:12:01,035
Take this container to
the boundary in 30 minutes

1010
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:02,399
The buyer is waiting

1011
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:03,574
Yes

1012
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:05,174
More

1013
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:15,387
Your buyer was killed

1014
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:17,959
Now the skull is none
of your business

1015
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,952
We will send it back to
Zhen Yang by ourselves

1016
01:12:21,563 --> 01:12:23,827
Surrender now

1017
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:25,694
Or you will be killed

1018
01:12:26,368 --> 01:12:27,164
Man with a golden gun

1019
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:30,127
I've caught your fellows

1020
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:32,129
You'd better surrender now

1021
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:43,214
Damn!

1022
01:12:45,788 --> 01:12:46,686
You claim yourself a man

1023
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:48,311
Luckily I've wore bullet proof vest

1024
01:12:49,124 --> 01:12:49,988
I shouldn't have risked
my life for you

1025
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,990
You didn't say a word
but just beat me?

1026
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:54,722
You want to beat me?
Beat him!

1027
01:13:17,386 --> 01:13:18,353
I'm forced to be a betrayer

1028
01:13:18,787 --> 01:13:19,651
I co-operate with you

1029
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:21,686
I know where he is.
Follow me

1030
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:55,446
Come on, I'm waiting for you

1031
01:13:55,824 --> 01:13:57,257
Be careful. Go away

1032
01:14:03,432 --> 01:14:04,421
I can shoot you to
death this time

1033
01:14:26,388 --> 01:14:28,356
Stop looking!
Use our powerful stance!

1034
01:14:33,362 --> 01:14:35,387
High temperature flame!

1035
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:36,355
I don't believe your armour

1036
01:14:36,532 --> 01:14:39,160
can stand the High
temperature flame

1037
01:14:42,804 --> 01:14:43,668
Shit! I'm sorry!

1038
01:14:44,139 --> 01:14:45,504
I used up the gas last night!

1039
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:47,274
Sorry for not informing you

1040
01:14:47,576 --> 01:14:48,736
Sorry, real sorry!

1041
01:14:55,918 --> 01:14:57,510
Playing ball?
I'll blow it off

1042
01:14:57,686 --> 01:14:58,983
Your turn now

1043
01:15:01,089 --> 01:15:02,317
Don't forget me!

1044
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:06,655
Wonder Fist!

1045
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:41,522
I shouldn't have provided
you good living

1046
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:44,730
You betrayed me for
a pork vendor!

1047
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:52,530
Chai's just been killed

1048
01:15:52,941 --> 01:15:53,965
You loved him?

1049
01:15:54,743 --> 01:15:56,768
I'll send you to hell with him

1050
01:15:59,047 --> 01:15:59,911
Chai!

1051
01:16:05,153 --> 01:16:06,882
I know your trick!

1052
01:16:09,424 --> 01:16:11,085
If yes, why didn't you
tell me beforehand?

1053
01:16:12,094 --> 01:16:12,890
Ling Ling Chai

1054
01:16:13,462 --> 01:16:14,486
Chai, are you alright?

1055
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:15,693
Alright, I am fine

1056
01:16:15,998 --> 01:16:17,465
Please don't say official lines

1057
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,432
Aren't you executed?

1058
01:16:20,135 --> 01:16:21,227
I am so mad about this!

1059
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:22,995
You made me lose one hundred!

1060
01:16:41,523 --> 01:16:42,649
Out

1061
01:16:55,137 --> 01:16:57,264
Bad boss, bad fellows

1062
01:16:57,706 --> 01:16:59,537
I can't imagine your fellows
are more greedy than you

1063
01:17:00,008 --> 01:17:00,975
What a shame to stand
in front of the words

1064
01:17:01,143 --> 01:17:03,111
"Faithful to our country"

1065
01:17:03,478 --> 01:17:05,571
If you, the nasty evil,
still exist in China,

1066
01:17:05,881 --> 01:17:07,610
our people won't have better lives

1067
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,051
I have to kill you now

1068
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:11,950
Don't you think you
trash can kill me?

1069
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,212
Trash?

1070
01:17:14,456 --> 01:17:15,423
I used up all my days

1071
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,455
to invent this

1072
01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:19,726
"Super Weapon",
product serial Killing 3000

1073
01:17:20,195 --> 01:17:23,790
It's combined to 10 killing weapons.
Now, it's done

1074
01:17:23,965 --> 01:17:25,023
Chai, step aside

1075
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:26,295
Far away

1076
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:27,700
Far far away!

1077
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:29,399
Really?

1078
01:17:30,305 --> 01:17:31,636
I wish to see it

1079
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,233
Killing 3000

1080
01:17:36,411 --> 01:17:37,036
Knife

1081
01:17:37,379 --> 01:17:38,038
Bicycle chain

1082
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:39,141
Fire powder

1083
01:17:39,548 --> 01:17:40,139
Acid

1084
01:17:40,315 --> 01:17:41,043
Drugs

1085
01:17:41,216 --> 01:17:41,807
Gun

1086
01:17:41,983 --> 01:17:42,506
Grenade

1087
01:17:42,684 --> 01:17:43,548
Triangle sharpener

1088
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:44,913
Every kinds of weapon can kill

1089
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,418
Now, it's combined into one

1090
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:48,583
Are you scared?

1091
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,725
You nuts!
You should have been killed

1092
01:17:52,194 --> 01:17:53,024
Wait

1093
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,029
Man Si

1094
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,924
Chai, I depend on you

1095
01:18:07,209 --> 01:18:08,437
Well, I've no other choice

1096
01:18:10,612 --> 01:18:12,273
I have to fight alone

1097
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:16,906
Butcher's knife?

1098
01:18:27,696 --> 01:18:29,459
Butcher's knife

1099
01:18:51,386 --> 01:18:52,318
No!

1100
01:19:26,788 --> 01:19:30,224
Bastard! Let me see
how powerful you are

1101
01:19:31,092 --> 01:19:32,389
I will let you see my power

1102
01:19:33,028 --> 01:19:34,086
Damn you!

1103
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:56,317
What kind of knife is it?

1104
01:19:57,285 --> 01:19:58,183
Butcher's knife

1105
01:19:58,687 --> 01:19:59,779
It's used to kill beast!

1106
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:53,501
Give me $5 pork please

1107
01:20:57,412 --> 01:20:58,106
My stall is temporarily closed

1108
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,611
come back an hour later

1109
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:00,845
Can you waste an hour for that?

1110
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:02,984
I don't think you need more
than 3 minutes

1111
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:04,550
3 hours are not enough
for me instead!

1112
01:21:05,353 --> 01:21:06,911
Chai, let's go home

1113
01:21:07,222 --> 01:21:08,280
Don't waste any time

1114
01:21:08,423 --> 01:21:09,185
And this place is nice

1115
01:21:09,357 --> 01:21:10,619
Damn!

1116
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,460
Chai, it's a shit!

1117
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:23,333
Our spy satellite
is lost in the space

1118
01:21:23,905 --> 01:21:24,929
It's related to the safety

1119
01:21:25,106 --> 01:21:26,505
of our country

1120
01:21:26,675 --> 01:21:27,767
Now, I am newly promoted

1121
01:21:27,943 --> 01:21:29,410
don't you want me to have trouble?

1122
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:31,178
Come back and help me

1123
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:33,373
I am now dealing some
loving affairs with my girl

1124
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:35,172
About the country, that's peanut,
just forget it

1125
01:21:35,317 --> 01:21:36,045
Man Si

1126
01:21:36,785 --> 01:21:41,154
I've told you many times,
I'm called Da Mansi!
