1
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,600
Beware the beast man,

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
for he is the Devil's pawn.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,400
Alone among God's primates,

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,720
he kills for sport or lust or greed.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,120
Yea, he will murder his brother

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,520
to possess his brother's land.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,560
Let him not breed in great numbers,

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,040
for he will make a desert
of his home and yours.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,000
Shun him,

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,240
for he is the harbinger of death.

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Nova.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,160
Where will you go?

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,080
Follow the shoreline.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,320
Don't try to follow us.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm pretty handy with this.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,160
Of that, I'm sure.
All my life I've awaited your coming

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,120
and dreaded it.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,560
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,760
The Forbidden Zone
was once a paradise.

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,680
Your breed made a desert
of it ages ago.

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,520
It still doesn't give me the why.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,880
A planet where apes
evolved from men?

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,760
There's got to be an answer.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't look for it, Taylor.

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,920
You may not like what you find.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,520
Zira, Cornelius, untie me.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,960
What will he find out there, Doctor?

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,880
His destiny.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Beneath The Planet
Of The Apes

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,880
Damn you all to hell!

31
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,520
No, Skipper. It's...
It's me again.

32
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,320
Just me.

33
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Brent...

34
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
did you contact Earth?

35
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
I tried to, sir.
Not a crackle.

36
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Skipper...

37
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
I took an Earth time reading

38
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
just before reentry.

39
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,760
What did you get?

40
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,360
3955.

41
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,600
3955?

42
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,160
A.D.

43
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,480
Almighty God.

44
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,720
Well, we were following
Taylor's trajectory.

45
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,680
So whatever happened to us

46
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,600
must have happened to him.

47
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,440
What about us?

48
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,320
Where... where are we?

49
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,680
Well, in my opinion, Skipper, we've...

50
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,080
we passed through a Haslein Curve,

51
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,000
a bend in time.

52
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,280
I don't know what planet we're on, but...

53
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,200
...fact is we're both of us here,

54
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
we're breathing, we're conscious,
we got...

55
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,680
...plenty of oxygen, water.
Here!

56
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
We're going to be all right, Skipper.
Gonna be alright.

57
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,600
As soon as you feel better, we'll...

58
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,960
...we'll run
a navigational lesson.

59
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,560
God, if I could only see the sun.

60
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,960
It's up there all right.

61
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,880
You can feel it.

62
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
Yes...

63
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,720
but which sun?

64
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
I don't know.

65
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
I don't know. Our computer's shot.

66
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,960
We're lucky to be alive.

67
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,220
Lucky?

68
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,440
No.

69
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,320
If it's 3955 A.D...

70
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,640
Oh, my God.

71
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,880
My wife...

72
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,240
my two daughters...

73
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
dead.

74
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,320
Everyone I ever knew.

75
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
Everyone.

76
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,760
Hey!

77
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,440
Who are you?

78
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,640
I... Don't be afraid.

79
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,080
I just...

80
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,000
Just tell me where I am.

81
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,080
Can you understand me?

82
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,640
My name's Brent.

83
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,440
Brent.

84
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,240
No... No, I don't want to hurt you. I...

85
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,760
I just want to know where I am.

86
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
Where are you from?

87
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,160
I mean, your people,
where are they? How do l...

88
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,280
How do I get to them? Which way?

89
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,360
Can you... Can you talk?

90
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,640
Right, right, so you can't talk.

91
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
Taylor!

92
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
Where is he?

93
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,440
Taylor.

94
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Taylor.

95
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,120
Nova.

96
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,040
Nova.

97
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
Nova.

98
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,080
Come on.

99
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,560
That's the idea.

100
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,000
Taylor.

101
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
Nova.

102
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,880
Here.

103
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Taylor.

104
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,080
Taylor.

105
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,000
OK, here's the prize.

106
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,600
Go to the head of the class.

107
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,200
Why don't we settle down
and found a colony?

108
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,080
All the kids will learn to talk.

109
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Sure they will.

110
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,800
Now, where in hell
do we go from here?

111
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,160
We might make it yet.

112
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,240
Taylor.

113
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
Taylor.

114
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,400
Just tell me what happened to him.

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,760
Is he hurt? ls he alive?

116
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
Where is he?

117
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,800
It wasn't here.

118
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,840
A minute ago, that wasn't here.

119
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,240
I'm not the only one.

120
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,160
She sees it, too.

121
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,560
Listen.

122
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,280
Listen now.

123
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,280
If you lose me...

124
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,520
If you lose me...

125
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,280
me,

126
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
try to find Zira.

127
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Remember?

128
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,640
Zira. Go find Zira.

129
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,520
Zira.

130
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,640
This tag,

131
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,200
did he give it to you?

132
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,440
Where did you get this?

133
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,120
Look, is there...
is there someone...

134
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,480
some other... someone who can talk?

135
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,880
Look.

136
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,800
You...

137
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,200
take me...

138
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,600
to Taylor.

139
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
Taylor.

140
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,200
Taylor now.

141
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,120
Which way?

142
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,040
My God, it's...

143
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,720
It's a city of apes.

144
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,440
I'll tell you one thing
that every good soldier knows.

145
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,760
The only thing that counts
in the end is power.

146
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,680
Naked, merciless force!

147
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,160
Members of the Citizens' Council,

148
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,960
I am a simple soldier,

149
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,400
and as a soldier, I see things simply.

150
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,720
I don't say all humans are evil

151
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,600
simply because their skin is white.

152
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,120
No.

153
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,400
But our great Lawgiver tells us
that never,

154
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
NEVER will the human
have the ape's divine faculty

155
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,000
for being able to distinguish

156
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,200
between evil and good.

157
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
The only good human is a dead human!

158
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
It's a bloody nightmare.

159
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,160
But those fortunate enough
to remain alive

160
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
will have the privilege

161
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,160
of being used
by our Minister of Science,

162
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
the good Dr. Zaius.

163
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,280
Zira, stop. You're in danger.

164
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
So is the future of science,

165
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
with a rebel rouse fomenting
a senseless military adventure.

166
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,680
The Forbidden Zone has been
closed for centuries,

167
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,480
and rightly so.
However, we now have evidence

168
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,880
that that vast barren area
is inhabited.

169
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,680
By what or by whom we don't know,

170
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,040
but if they live, and live they do,

171
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
then they must eat.

172
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,840
Now we must replenish the lands

173
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,720
that were ravaged by the humans

174
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,120
with new improved feeding grounds,

175
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,220
and these grounds we can obtain
in the once Forbidden Zone.

176
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
It's therefore our holy duty

177
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,060
to enter it,

178
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,680
to put the marks of our guns
and our wheels and our flags upon it!

179
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,160
To expand the boundaries

180
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,560
of our ineluctable power.

181
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,040
And to invade.

182
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,400
Invade!

183
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,720
Invade!

184
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,440
Invade!

185
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,840
Zira, please!
As your husband, I beg you to stand.

186
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,880
Only for my principles.

187
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,400
All right, for your principles and mine.
Only please stand!

188
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,040
I got to get out.
Yeah, I got to get back up there.

189
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,920
I don't know how or what with, but...

190
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,320
...I'm not staying here.

191
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,480
General, I only pray
you know what you're doing.

192
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,360
How can you have any doubt, Dr. Zaius?

193
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,200
You're aware of the reports
we've been receiving

194
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,120
of strange manifestations

195
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,040
in the Forbidden Zone,

196
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,400
manifestations which you,
if I might add,

197
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,320
as Minister of Science,

198
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,720
have been unable to fathom.

199
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,080
12... 12 of my finest scouts

200
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,000
just disappeared,

201
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,920
vanished into thin air.

202
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,000
11.

203
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,320
Huh?

204
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,200
Very well, 11 ...

205
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,120
11.

206
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,840
And the 12th returned
with incredible stories

207
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,160
of huge walls of fire,

208
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,080
strange violent earthquakes,

209
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,440
his... his mind gone,
shattered no doubt

210
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,760
by some unsimian torture.

211
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,800
Well, General,

212
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,960
- I still think you're being hasty.
- No, Doctor. Decisive.

213
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,880
Now we invade or we starve.

214
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,240
It's as simple as that.

215
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,040
And as dangerous.

216
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,720
What is more dangerous
than famine, Doctor?

217
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,440
The unknown.

218
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
If I had any proper sense

219
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,800
of scientific purpose, Cornelius,

220
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,280
I shouldn't be cutting up

221
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,560
the healthy heads of humans.

222
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
I should be dissecting

223
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,760
the diseased brains of gorillas

224
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,720
to find out what went wrong.

225
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,240
And how would you put it right?

226
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,600
I've wet-nursed their babies

227
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,960
on the milk of chimpanzees
and milk of kindness.

228
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,360
At least our child, when it's born,

229
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,240
won't be breast-fed on bile.

230
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
You know, my dear,

231
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
the trouble with us intellectuals

232
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,840
is that we have
responsibilities and no power.

233
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,000
I think I'll make a chocolate icing.

234
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,040
Do you like chocolate?

235
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,080
Oh, what, dear?

236
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,040
No no no no.
Of course you don't. But I do.

237
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,760
If we had that power
here in our hands,

238
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,720
we'd be worse than them.

239
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,640
I don't agree.

240
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,440
Gorillas are cruel
because they're stupid...

241
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,880
all bone and no brains.

242
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,240
Zira, my dear,

243
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,680
I wish you would not talk like that.

244
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,960
Somebody is liable to hear you.

245
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Nova!

246
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,000
What are you doing here?

247
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,960
Taylor?

248
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
No, not... not Taylor.
My name is Brent.

249
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,040
You talked!

250
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,960
That's impossible.

251
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,880
In a whole lifetime

252
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,760
devoted to the scientific
study of humans,

253
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,640
I've only found one other
like you who could talk.

254
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,600
Taylor.

255
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,040
Is he alive?

256
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,480
Have you seen him?

257
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,760
Where? Where? Tell us.

258
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Where? Where?

259
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,240
I don't know where, I...

260
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
I'm trying to find him.

261
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,080
The longer I stay here,
the less I'm beginning to care.

262
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, now, we loved Taylor.

263
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,400
He was a fine, a unique specimen.

264
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,800
Why, if it had
not been for Zira here,

265
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,760
he... he would still be here,

266
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,360
a stuffed specimen

267
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,160
in the great hall
of the Zaius Museum,

268
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,480
with his two friends.

269
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
With his two friends?

270
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,480
Well, I don't plan
to stay around here

271
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,720
quite that long.

272
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,080
Look, can you get me
some food, some... some water,

273
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,600
a map... a map,

274
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
so at least I'll have some
idea where I'm heading?

275
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,960
You'll want that
taken care of, too.

276
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
I'll get the map.

277
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,000
Now,

278
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,920
if you will look up here,

279
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,320
ah, yes, towards the north.

280
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,000
This was the last place
that we saw Taylor and Nova.

281
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,560
What is that damn stuff?

282
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,000
You wouldn't know if I told you.

283
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,000
Just relax.

284
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,120
Among other things, I'm a trained vet.

285
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,680
Oh, great. Go on, go on.

286
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,120
Taylor was riding with Nova here,

287
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,560
between the lake and the sea.

288
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes, they were heading

289
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,920
deep into the territory we call..

290
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,560
Yes, I know. The Forbidden Zone.

291
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,240
Who told you that?

292
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,120
Hmm? Your glorious leader back there.

293
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,120
Quick!

294
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Cornelius, open the door.

295
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,440
Put the things away.

296
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,560
Open it!

297
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,560
Oh, Dr. Zaius, how nice.

298
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
We were just about

299
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,440
to have something to eat.

300
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,200
Not until I talk some sense

301
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,940
to that headstrong wife of yours.

302
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,200
Where is she?

303
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,680
Good day, Dr. Zaius.

304
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,960
Has there been an accident?

305
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,880
Cornelius hit me

306
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,600
for my bad behavior at the meeting.

307
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,600
I don't blame him.

308
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,560
I don't resent it,

309
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,080
but his nails need clipping.

310
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Enough of this nonsense.

311
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,800
Are you so blind,
you two psychologists

312
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
that you're unaware

313
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,200
that we're on the verge
of a grave crisis?

314
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,040
You heard the Ursus' speech.

315
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,880
Militaristic tripe.

316
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,020
Zira!

317
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,120
Perhaps. But now he has
the incident he requires

318
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
to go on a rampage of conquest.

319
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,560
But that is appalling!

320
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,920
To remain silent

321
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,520
while this bully Ursus
is permitted to..

322
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,240
to destroy everything
in his path

323
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,400
is no longer possible.

324
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,840
As Minister of science,

325
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
it's my duty to find out

326
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,360
whether some other
form of life exists.

327
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,680
Where are you going?

328
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,240
Into the Forbidden Zone with Ursus.

329
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,760
Another manhunt, Doctor?

330
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,240
Someone or some thing

331
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,680
has outwitted the intelligence

332
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,960
of the gorillas.

333
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,520
- That shouldn't be difficult.
- Shh, Zira.

334
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,000
We apes have learned
to live in innocence.

335
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,280
Let no one,

336
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,680
be it man or some other creature,

337
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,920
dare to contaminate that innocence.

338
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,880
Why, is innocence so evil?

339
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,800
Ignorance is!

340
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,760
There is a time for truth.

341
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,720
And the time is always now.

342
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Are you asking me
to surrender my principles?

343
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,840
I am asking you
to be the guardians

344
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,240
of the higher
principles of science

345
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,680
during my absence.

346
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,320
I am asking for a truce

347
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
with your personal convictions

348
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,480
in an hour of public danger.

349
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,400
And you shall have it, Dr. Zaius,

350
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,280
or I shall hit her again.

351
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,680
Let us have no
violence, Cornelius.

352
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,560
Now, I'm relying on you both.

353
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,440
We are counting
on you, too, Doctor.

354
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,800
If I should fail
to return from the unknown,

355
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,680
the whole future
of our civilization

356
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,000
may be yours
to preserve or destroy,

357
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,880
so think well before you act.

358
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,280
Good-bye, Dr. Zaius,
and good luck.

359
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,360
Let me finish this up
and get you out of here!

360
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,560
Yeah, get me
out of here, please.

361
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,440
I've seen the delicate, humane
way they treat humans here.

362
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,360
I don't much care for it.

363
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,320
Have you a horse?

364
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,760
Yeah, out in the scrub.

365
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,160
I'd better get you
another set of clothes,

366
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,040
the kind fit for humans,
like yourself.

367
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,160
You'll pass. Get rid of this.

368
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,280
And this, too.

369
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,080
If you are caught by the gorillas,

370
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,520
you must remember one thing.

371
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,960
What's that?

372
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,560
Never to speak.

373
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,040
What the hell would I have
to say to a gorilla?

374
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,480
But you don't understand.

375
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,400
Only apes can speak.

376
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,800
Not her, and not you.

377
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,720
If they catch you speaking,

378
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,640
they will dissect you
and they will kill you

379
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,760
in that order.

380
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,360
Cornelius is right.
Be very careful.

381
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,760
And get out of these
things you're wearing

382
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,240
as soon as you can.

383
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,920
Thanks.

384
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,760
Thank us by finding Taylor.

385
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,160
Yeah, if he's still alive.

386
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,280
Scissors.

387
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,920
Sergeant, wait!

388
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,680
This is a type-E cranium.

389
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
Very unusual.

390
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,440
With occipital development.

391
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,120
Substandard lobe.

392
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,560
Female.

393
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,000
It's been a long time

394
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,520
since we've been able to study

395
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,840
specimens of such extraordinary

396
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,760
clinical interest.

397
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,680
Bring them inside.

398
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
No!

399
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
No, you can't have them.

400
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,360
They are marked
for target practice.

401
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,520
Take them away.

402
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,240
I'll take the key.

403
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,160
To the target range!

404
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,040
Uh, wait! Wait!

405
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,400
I'd better double lock the door.

406
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,920
Good luck.

407
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,600
All right!

408
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,480
God Almighty.

409
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,760
This used to be my home.

410
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,200
I...

411
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,120
I lived here,

412
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,040
worked here.

413
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,360
What... What happened?

414
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,440
What... What could've happened?

415
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,880
My God, did we finally do it?

416
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,600
Did we finally really do it?

417
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,480
Oh God,

418
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,640
bless, we pray You,
our great army

419
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,160
and its supreme commander

420
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
on the eve of a holy war

421
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,000
undertaken for Your sake,

422
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,360
and grant,

423
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,600
in the name of your Prophet,

424
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,520
our great Lawgiver,

425
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,280
that we, Your chosen servants,

426
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,600
created and born
in Your divine image,

427
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,000
may aspire the more perfectly

428
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,000
to that spiritual Godliness

429
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,520
and bodily beauty

430
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,400
which You, in Your infinite mercy,

431
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,720
have thought fit to deny
to our brutish enemies!

432
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,680
So be it.

433
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,280
There they go,

434
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,160
Dr. Zaius trotting
along beside them.

435
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,960
Don't be too hard
on the old boy, Zira.

436
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,400
His motives are honest.

437
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,800
He has only one motive:

438
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,600
to keep things exactly
as they have always been.

439
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,960
I say that's
time for a change.

440
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,360
Zira, we chimpanzees are too few.

441
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,280
How can we take initiative

442
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,200
when they're in control?

443
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,600
Love, yes! War, no!

444
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,040
No more lies!

445
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,480
No more crying!

446
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,920
No more guns!

447
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,480
No more blood! Stop!

448
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,440
Stop!

449
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,880
Stop the war!

450
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,400
Freedom! Freedom!

451
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,760
Whoa!

452
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,360
Freedom! Peace!

453
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,840
Peace and freedom!

454
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,560
Get off the road, young people.

455
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,960
Freedom! Peace!

456
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,840
Get them out of the way.

457
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,280
Wait.

458
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,200
We don't want martyrs,
do we?

459
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,760
We want peace!

460
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,640
We want freedom!

461
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,640
Major, do it quietly.

462
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,280
We want peace!

463
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,200
We want freedom!

464
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,320
Peace!

465
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,760
Freedom! Peace!

466
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,200
Freedom!

467
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,120
Peace and freedom!

468
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,320
Battalion.

469
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,540
Are you what we were

470
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,480
before we learned to talk

471
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,360
and made a mess of everything?

472
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,360
Did any good ever
come from all that talk

473
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,280
around all those tables?

474
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,980
- I wonder where the hell they are?
- I wonder where the hell WE are?

475
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,800
Do you know what I think? We're near
the Forbidden Zone. That's what I think.

476
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,360
Hell, that's where the army's headed.

477
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,840
That real nice.
They'll roll right over us.

478
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,160
Why can't we go
back to our outfits?

479
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,600
Because the sarge says
to keep looking until we find them.

480
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,160
Nova.

481
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,520
Nova, Nova, wake up.

482
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,960
We've got to get going. Come on.

483
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,960
That hum...

484
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,320
You hear it, too?

485
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,080
All right, come on,
we're going to follow it.

486
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,480
Well, whoever or whatever...

487
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,440
something's guiding us.

488
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,760
Whatever they are,
they breathe air.

489
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,800
Well, there's an intelligence
working in this place.

490
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,200
That sound, good or bad,
it's either a warning

491
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,120
or some kind of directional device.

492
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,480
It doesn't much matter.
They know we're here.

493
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,700
Put my hands...

494
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,360
around her throat.

495
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,040
Off!

496
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,660
Hold her throat!

497
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,120
She...

498
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,200
dies!

499
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,120
Get out!

500
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,060
Get out of my head!

501
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,800
I reveal my inmost self
unto my God.

502
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,020
What did you say?

503
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,920
What do you mean there's no point?

504
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,280
Will they hurt her?

505
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,640
No, maybe not
physically, but here.

506
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,560
Here, you can hurt here. I know.

507
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,760
Your lips...

508
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,760
don't move.

509
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,680
But I can hear.

510
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,680
No, I mean...

511
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,560
I know what you're thinking.

512
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,880
Nothing. I...

513
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,560
I saw nothing.

514
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,080
Who are you?

515
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,280
Brent.

516
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,160
Who are you?

517
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,400
Oh, I see.
The only reality in the universe.

518
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,320
That's nice to know.

519
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,520
I got here by accident.
How did you get here?

520
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,920
Oh wait, you got it all wrong.

521
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,640
Why would I want to spy on you?

522
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,800
I'm not even sure you exist.

523
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,400
Of course I know who I am!
I'm an astronaut!

524
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,940
I was sent here
on a rescue mission

525
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,820
to find a fellow
astronaut, Taylor.

526
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,160
We're from this planet, but...

527
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,200
...from another time,

528
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,200
2,000 years ago.

529
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,040
I know l...

530
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,720
I know I sound insane.

531
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,800
And it's my insanity.

532
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,400
No, no, I don't know how to get back.
We...

533
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,320
We came through a defect,
a slippage in time.

534
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,280
That's what must have
happened to Taylor.

535
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,160
I'm sure he tried to get back.

536
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,880
Yes, my Skipper is dead.
I'm... I'm alone.

537
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,360
Who?

538
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,320
Nova? What's that?

539
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,040
Some star? A galaxy? What's Nova?

540
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,640
All right, all right, yes!
I know her. I know her.

541
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,160
No, no. She's harmless.
Let her alone.

542
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,720
All right, just tell me
what you want to know. Tell me.

543
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,520
She helped me

544
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,360
to break out of ape city.

545
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,120
No! Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute!

546
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,120
Stop it!

547
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,040
I can't understand you.

548
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,400
You're all screaming at me
at the same time.

549
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,120
I can't separate it!

550
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,600
He's right.
He has only limited intelligence.

551
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,080
We should speak aloud,

552
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,600
and one at a time.

553
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,120
You were in the city of the apes?

554
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,120
Yes, two days ago.

555
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
What sights did you see?

556
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,800
You're talking.

557
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,720
Certainly we can talk.

558
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,040
We use speech when we must.

559
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,280
When we pray.

560
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,360
When we sing to our God.

561
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,440
You mean that..
that thing out there,

562
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,520
an atomic bomb, your god?

563
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,960
You don't understand.

564
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,640
The Bomb is a holy
weapon of peace.

565
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,200
Holy weapon of peace!

566
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,520
Peace.

567
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,840
Mr. Brent, we're a patient people,

568
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,680
but we are determined
to know what the apes want..

569
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,600
war or peace.

570
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,520
Try to understand.

571
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,360
The only weapons we have
are purely illusion.

572
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,800
You just imagined that he hurt you.

573
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,800
Traumatic hypnosis
is a weapon of peace.

574
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,040
Like the visual deterrent..

575
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,320
or the sonic deterrent..

576
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,280
Let me make a last appeal
to your reason

577
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,440
before we inflict more of this on you.

578
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,640
These are weapons of peace, Mr. Brent.

579
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,760
Like all our weapons.

580
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,000
Mere illusions.

581
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,320
Mere illusions? Damn your hypocrisy!

582
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,680
Is that bomb out there,
is that an illusion?

583
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,880
It's operational, isn't it?

584
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,440
The firing mechanism..
it's intact, isn't it?

585
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,160
We very much need
your help, Mr. Brent.

586
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,640
Why?

587
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,000
We are the keepers
of the Divine Bomb.

588
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,200
It is our only reason for survival.

589
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,120
And yet, as you see,
we are defenseless,

590
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,800
defenseless against
the slaughtering,

591
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,120
monstrous, materialistic apes.

592
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,800
I'll help nobody.

593
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,680
So go ahead. Annihilate each other.

594
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,240
I forgive you your language.

595
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,960
Sometimes your sanity
is about to give way.

596
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,360
I hope that does not happen.

597
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,120
I hope you can tell us..

598
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,280
Exactly what the apes are planning.

599
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,320
We've caught some of their scouts.

600
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,560
They're hideous creatures.

601
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,920
We've had them here,

602
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
standing precisely where you are now.

603
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,920
Either their skulls were too thick,

604
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,080
or they really
knew nothing at all.

605
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,440
Neither do l.
Can't you understand that?

606
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,240
I don't know anything!

607
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,760
You make us very sad, Mr. Brent.

608
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,560
She can't help you.

609
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,480
She can't even talk.

610
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,920
Don't harm her.

611
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,640
We never harm anyone, Mr. Brent.

612
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,040
You're going to harm her.

613
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,400
The apes sent me out to you.

614
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,880
You're lying.

615
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,360
How do you know?

616
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,480
How do you always know?

617
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,080
Nova.

618
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,600
Now..

619
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,040
Tell us of the apes.

620
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,280
The apes...

621
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,000
are marching on your city.

622
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,760
Bugler,

623
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,680
sound the advance.

624
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,040
Ursus!

625
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,760
Ursus, I warned you.

626
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,040
Look what we're faced with!

627
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,960
I told you you should wait!

628
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,280
Brutal butchery!

629
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,680
I swear, those responsible

630
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,240
shall pay with
torture and with death.

631
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,840
If you have any pity,

632
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,040
give orders to shoot
our poor people.

633
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,080
I can't order them to do
what the Lawgiver has forbidden.

634
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,040
Ape shall not kill ape.

635
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,960
Hold your positions!

636
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,480
He bleeds.

637
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,640
The Lawgiver bleeds!

638
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,120
The spirit of the Lawgiver lives!

639
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,000
We are still God's chosen!

640
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,880
This is a vision!

641
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,040
And it is a lie!

642
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,760
The vision was false!

643
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,920
Bugler,

644
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,440
sound the advance.

645
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,240
Advance!

646
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,120
Stupid animals.

647
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,440
They don't have the brain
to hold our illusions.

648
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,360
We have no defense.

649
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,800
Except our Bomb.

650
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,360
Call our people to the high sanctuary.

651
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,320
Do you know the range

652
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,360
of their city?

653
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,080
Yes.

654
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,880
Set in the mechanism and wait for me.

655
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,440
I want a public thought projection

656
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,840
at adult and infant level.

657
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,000
Adults to the cathedral,
infants indoors.

658
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,920
Is nowandevershallbe

659
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,640
World without end

660
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,320
Amen

661
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,840
Amen

662
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,600
Amen

663
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:51,160
Amen

664
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,760
The heavens declare
the glory of the Bomb,

665
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,520
and the firmament
showeth His handiwork.

666
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,640
His sun has gone out
unto all the land.

667
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:05,080
And gives light
unto the end of the world.

668
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,480
He descendeth from the
outermost part of heaven,

669
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,720
and there is nothing
hid from the heat thereof.

670
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,600
There is neither
speech nor language,

671
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,560
yet His voice is heard among them.

672
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,640
Praise Him.

673
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,040
Praise Him.

674
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,640
My strength and my redeemer.

675
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,560
Glory be to the Bomb

676
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,880
and to the holy fallout

677
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,080
as it was in
the beginning, is now,

678
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,720
and ever shall be,
world without end.

679
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,280
Amen.

680
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,960
Amen

681
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,240
Amen

682
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,280
Amen

683
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,360
Amen

684
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,240
Almighty and everlasting Bomb,

685
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,480
who came down among us

686
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,400
to make heaven under Earth,

687
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,800
Iighten our darkness.

688
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,840
Instrument of God,
grant us Thy peace.

689
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,560
Almighty Bomb

690
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,960
Who destroyedallheavens

691
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,320
Andcreatedangels

692
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,400
Behold His glory

693
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,880
Behold the truth that abides in us.

694
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,920
Reveal that truth unto that Maker.

695
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,640
I reveal my inmost self unto my God.

696
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,280
Unto my God.

697
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:52,560
Unto my God

698
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,680
All things brightandbeautiful

699
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:23,760
All creatures greatandsmall

700
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,400
All things wise and wonderful

701
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:34,520
The good Bomb made us all

702
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,480
He gave us eyes to see with

703
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:45,040
And lips that we might tell

704
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:51,080
How great the Bomb Almighty

705
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:59,120
Who made all things well

706
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,480
Let everyone go
to his private shelter.

707
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,040
Empty the streets.

708
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,600
They're to find
the city of the dead.

709
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,600
May the blessing
of the Bomb Almighty

710
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,520
and the fellowship
of the Holy Fallout

711
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,240
descend on us this day
and forevermore.

712
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:32,480
Amen

713
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,280
I trust this simple ceremony

714
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,480
convinced you of
our peaceable intentions,

715
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,480
and I'd like to thank you
for your cooperation.

716
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,360
When may we hope
to be set free?

717
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,720
You may hope whenever
you please, Mr. Brent.

718
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,120
How could we
hope to let you go

719
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,040
on the eve of war, Mr. Brent?

720
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,320
You know too many ofour secrets,

721
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,880
Iike your friend.

722
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,760
Taylor!

723
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,960
You're Brent.

724
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,040
My God, Taylor!

725
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,440
Brent! How in the hell
did you get here?

726
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,360
Spaceship, ape city, subway..

727
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,720
Byyourself?

728
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,160
No, Nova found me.

729
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,080
Nova? ls she with you? Where?

730
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,600
I don't know. They separated us.

731
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,600
They tried to make me kill her.

732
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:50,200
Mr. Taylor, Mr. Brent,
we're peaceful people.

733
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,600
We don't kill our enemies.

734
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:56,600
We get our enemies
to kill each other.

735
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,000
I'm fighting it.

736
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,240
I'm fighting it off.

737
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,200
Taylor.

738
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,480
Taylor.

739
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,160
Taylor!

740
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,080
Unto God...

741
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,800
I reveal my inmost self.

742
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,960
This isn't exactly sterile.

743
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,320
We'll do the best we can.

744
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,240
Taylor.

745
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,720
Taylor, they've got a bomb..

746
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,880
Atomic bomb.

747
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,800
It's operational.

748
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,160
They intend to use it.

749
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,600
What type is it?

750
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,040
I don't know.
I don't know what type.

751
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,440
I've never seen it before.

752
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,880
Didn't you see a series number?

753
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:18,280
No numbers, just some
letters on one of the fins,

754
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,760
Greek letters.

755
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,960
Alpha...

756
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,600
And omega.

757
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,760
What?

758
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,120
The doomsday bomb.

759
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,520
My God.

760
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,360
Another lovely souvenir
from the 20th Century.

761
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,280
They weren't satisfied with a bomb

762
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,680
that could knock out a city.

763
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:53,000
They finally built one
with a cobalt casing,

764
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,360
all in the sweet name of peace.

765
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,760
Those bloody fools.

766
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,000
They don't know what they've got.

767
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,520
They pray to the damn thing.

768
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,920
If they shoot it off,

769
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,800
it could set off a chain reaction

770
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,240
in the whole atmosphere.

771
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,480
Burn the planet to a cinder.

772
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,080
How's that for
your ultimate weapon?

773
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,840
This must be what
your scout reported,

774
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,920
a subterranean passage.

775
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,280
I think it's worth exploring.

776
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,520
What will you do, Holiness?

777
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,240
Everything necessary.

778
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,440
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

779
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,360
I'm thinking just that.

780
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,360
Nova.

781
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,480
Nova.

782
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,120
Ah, God!

783
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,080
Should let them all die..

784
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,000
the gorillas, every damn...

785
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,760
When it comes time.

786
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,440
It's time it was finished.

787
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,160
Finished.

788
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,200
Taylor.

789
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,200
Come on, come on.

790
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,040
The bomb.

791
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,440
Yeah.

792
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,160
Why not?

793
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,280
They're obscene!

794
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,000
Follow me!

795
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,200
Sergeant!

796
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,440
Arrest that creature.

797
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,160
This is the instrument of my God.

798
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,560
He can speak.

799
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,640
Your God, eh?

800
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,600
Sergeant.

801
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,400
Your God didn't
save you, did he, huh?

802
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,960
Ursus!

803
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,840
That weapon is built by man.

804
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,760
You can't shoot it
down with bullets.

805
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,480
If we can't shoot it down,
we'll pull it down.

806
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,720
Rope! Block and tackle!

807
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,920
You don't know what you're doing.

808
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,040
It will kill us all!

809
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,080
I'll find a way to stop it.

810
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,000
Men, over there!

811
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,480
Ursus, someone at the pillar!

812
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,640
Zaius.

813
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,360
Taylor!

814
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,280
It's dooms day.

815
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,560
The end of the world.

816
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,960
Help me.

817
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,880
You ask me to help you!

818
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,000
Man is evil,

819
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,560
capable of nothing
but destruction!

820
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,240
You...

821
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,120
bloody bastard.

822
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:47,680
In one of the countless billions
of galaxies in the universe

823
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,640
Iies a medium-sized star.

824
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,040
And one of its satellites,

825
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,240
a green
and insignificant planet,
now is dead.
