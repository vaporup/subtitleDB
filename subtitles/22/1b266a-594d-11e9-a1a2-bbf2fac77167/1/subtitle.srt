Yes, I do.

2019
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:27,735
The Joker won.

2020
02:15:30,061 --> 02:15:32,814
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

2021
02:15:33,341 --> 02:15:35,013
...undone.

2022
02:15:35,501 --> 02:15:40,211
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

2023
02:15:40,381 --> 02:15:41,496
We bet it all on him.

2024
02:15:42,781 --> 02:15:45,534
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

2025
02:15:46,101 --> 02:15:47,454
People will lose hope.

2026
02:15:47,621 --> 02:15:49,293
They won't.

2027
02:15:51,701 --> 02:15:53,498
They must never know what he did.

2028
02:15:53,661 --> 02:15:55,413
Five dead.

2029
02:15:55,701 --> 02:15:56,929
Two of them cops.

2030
02:15:57,101 --> 02:15:59,456
- You can't sweep that--
- No.

2031
02:16:04,061 --> 02:16:06,780
But the Joker cannot win.

2032
02:16:11,821 --> 02:16:14,893
Gotham needs its true hero.

2033
02:16:21,021 --> 02:16:23,933
- No.
- You either die a hero...

2034
02:16:24,101 --> 02:16:28,379
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

2035
02:16:28,541 --> 02:16:30,293
I can do those things...

2036
02:16:30,701 --> 02:16:33,613
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

2037
02:16:36,501 --> 02:16:39,254
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

2038
02:16:39,421 --> 02:16:41,252
No, no, you can't. You're not.

2039
02:16:41,421 --> 02:16:43,889
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

2040
02:16:45,501 --> 02:16:46,570
Call it in.

2041

GORDON:
A hero.

2042
02:16:51,581 --> 02:16:54,698
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

2043
02:16:55,261 --> 02:16:57,695
Nothing less than a knight...

2044
02:16:58,221 --> 02:16:59,859
...shining.

2045
02:17:00,461 --> 02:17:02,019

<i>They'll hunt you.</i>

BATMAN:
<i>You'll hunt me.</i>

2047
02:17:04,381 --> 02:17:06,258
<i>You'll condemn me.</i>

2048
02:17:06,941 --> 02:17:09,136
<i>Set the dogs on me.</i>

2049
02:17:12,741 --> 02:17:14,936
<i>Because that's what needs to happen.</i>

2050
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:17,892
<i>Because sometimes...</i>

2051
02:17:18,061 --> 02:17:20,131
<i>...the truth isn't good enough.</i>

2052
02:17:20,981 --> 02:17:23,176
<i>Sometimes people deserve more.</i>

2053
02:17:26,501 --> 02:17:30,255
<i>Sometimes people deserve</i>
<i>to have their faith rewarded.</i>

JAMES:
Batman.

2056
02:17:51,341 --> 02:17:53,013
Batman!

2057
02:17:53,781 --> 02:17:55,658
Why's he running, Dad?

2058
02:17:56,661 --> 02:17:57,935
Because we have to chase him.

2059
02:17:58,101 --> 02:18:00,854
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

2060
02:18:06,701 --> 02:18:08,214
He didn't do anything wrong.

[BARKING]

2062
02:18:10,861 --> 02:18:16,219
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

2063
02:18:17,581 --> 02:18:18,570
<i>So we'll hunt him...</i>

2064
02:18:21,581 --> 02:18:23,572
<i>...because he can take it.</i>

2065
02:18:25,981 --> 02:18:28,370
<i>Because he's not our hero.</i>

2066
02:18:35,621 --> 02:18:36,770
<i>He's a silent guardian...</i>

2067
02:18:37,901 --> 02:18:39,698
...a watchful protector.
