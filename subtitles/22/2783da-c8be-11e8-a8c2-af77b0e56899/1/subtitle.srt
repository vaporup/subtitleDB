1
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:22,662
I go for a walk along the creek,

2
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:28,701
watch the fishes
in the bleak water.

3
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:32,947
I am sad because of you,

4
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:36,620
my dear Saniye
with the waving hair.

5
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,738
I am sad because there’s no
love in your eyes.

6
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,627
I am sad because of you,

7
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:50,226
my dear Saniye
with the waving hair.

8
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,498
I am sad because there’s no
love in your eyes.

9
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,346
Cahit, are you fine?

10
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,258
Do you want to drink something, Seref?

11
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:35,028
Yes, coke.

12
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,259
Give me another beer.

13
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:44,664
You are thirsty today, right?

14
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,381
Yes, pal.

15
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,982
Why don’t you drink water then?

16
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,379
I’m not an animal.

17
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,661
How was the concert?

18
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:44,982
Piss off, Maren.

19
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,224
Asshole!

20
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:51,060
Fuck you!
- Motherfucker!

21
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:57,578
Hey you!

22
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,068
Hey tramp!
Hey, I'm talking to you!

23
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:05,187
Such a hot chick

24
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,426
and you drive her off?

25
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,740
Are you a queer?

26
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,460
Seems that you are gay- ...

27
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:33,218
Are you fucking insane?

28
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,784
Piss off Cahit! Go home!

29
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,465
Stop that bullshit!
Go home!

30
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:41,700
Go home now!

31
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,384
My bitch brought me here.

32
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,547
She said to Schiller that
she was afraid of her husband.

33
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,106
What am I?

34
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,582
"I'm afraid of my husband!"
She's so false!

35
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:15,061
But I know the right people.
I will take it out of her.

36
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:18,819
What kind of people?
- Security guys.

37
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,298
I'll get her down.
She doesn't know what she's up to?

38
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:31,225
Last time I was here too.
- You were 13 too ...

39
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:33,341
Cahit Tomruk please.

40
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,509
There are thousands of ways to kill yourself?
Why do you drive against a wall?

41
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,780
Who said that I wanted to kill myself?

42
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,741
There's no skid mark.

43
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,829
You are not allowed to
smoke here, Mister Tomruk.

44
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:27,582
Where does the name Tomruk come from?
- From Turkey.

45
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,821
I mean what does it mean?

46
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,258
No idea...
- The names always have such a nice meaning.

47
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:35,704
Really?

48
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:40,261
Yes. Much more as our names here have .
At least for the first names I know it for sure.

49
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:50,179
If you want to bring your life to an end just do it.
But you don't have to die that for.

50
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,303
Bring you life to an end
and move away.

51
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,460
Do something useful.

52
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,626
Do something.

53
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,139
Go to Africa.
Help people.

54
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,628
Do you know a band called "The The"?

55
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:13,543
Pardon?

56
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,227
They have a song
"If you can't change the world, change your world"

57
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,508
You want me to bring you the record?
- Got it already.

58
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:30,305
Am I allowed to say something Doc?

59
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:34,020
You are nuts?

60
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,222
Are you Turk?
Would you marry me?

61
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,308
What?
Would you marry me?

62
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,427
Piss off!

63
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,939
Nice to meet you,
Cahit Tomruk.

64
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:04,705
Cahit Tomruk... Sibel Tomruk...

65
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,903
Excuse me,
are you looking for something?

66
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,267
A beer.

67
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:24,747
Sorry we don't have beer.
But you can have a coffee.

68
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:31,942
The shame that you have brought
on us is inexcusable.

69
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:36,424
The biggest gift
for a human being is life.

70
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:40,578
There is no bigger gift
than life.

71
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:46,587
Who do you think you are that
you throw this gift away so easily?

72
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:52,586
You can be glad,
that you are still alive.

73
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:01,420
Do you have the key, Yilmaz?

74
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,222
See you later...

75
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,857
Can't you see what you do to him?

76
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:15,947
He perishes.

77
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,022
Look at me!

78
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,978
Look at me!

79
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,021
If something happens to dad I kill you.

80
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,662
Give me one too.

81
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:53,661
There’s no sense in suicide.

82
00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:00,058
The only thing you achieve
is to make us and you sad.

83
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:01,617
Do not forget that.

84
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,065
I thought that they let me be!

85
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:08,860
Let you be? Couldn't I teach
you anything!

86
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,021
Don't say that mother.

87
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,621
Oh, Sibel...

88
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:20,466
How long are you going to stay here?
- I don't know.

89
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,057
Don't panic with all this
lunatics in here!

90
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:40,501
You don't die like this.
- How don't you die?

91
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,900
Perpendicular.
- What perpendicular?

92
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:44,742
You have to cut perpendicular.

93
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,467
Perpendicular sucks.
- I see

94
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,186
Can you get me a beer?

95
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,386
If you marry me?

96
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:06,137
I only fuck men.
- Really?

97
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,984
You know what? I'll get you a beer.

98
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,224
Tonight at midnight in front
of the hospital. Ok?

99
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,500
Where's my beer?
- Follow me.

100
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,339
Where in Turkey do you come from?
- Mersin

101
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:55,985
I was told Mersin is beautiful.
- Yeah I know I'm born there.

102
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:59,705
We come from Zonguldak.
You know Zonguldak?

103
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,739
Why do you want to die?

104
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:10,505
I asked you something.

105
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,908
Do you like my nose?

106
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:20,942
Touch it.

107
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:34,459
My brother broke it because he
saw me holding someone's hand.

108
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,748
And now touch my tits.

109
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,224
Have you ever seen so hot tits?

110
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:47,228
I wanna live Cahit. I wanna live
I wanna dance I wanna fuck

111
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,268
not only with one guy.
Do you understand?

112
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:53,022
I'm not deaf!

113
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,067
Bullshit!

114
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:02,701
Do you marry me now Cahit?
- Forget it!

115
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,505
Shit!

116
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,947
Are you fucking crazy girl?

117
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:22,097
That's not a game!
We pretend to be married.

118
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,147
Do you understand?
- No I don't!

119
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,944
That's just an excuse for my parents
so that I don't have to live at home.

120
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:32,705
Ok we live together but
I promise I'm a good roommate.

121
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:36,545
I go shopping, cook, tidy up
the rooms, clean the restroom.

122
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:41,147
We have separate rooms, we don't fuck, we don't have anything together.
- And your parents?

123
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,347
They are just your parents-in-law.
You don't have a close relationship.

124
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:47,343
Relationship? We don't have a relationship at all?

125
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,348
From time to time they come
to our place and we come to theirs.

126
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,385
And then we pretend to be wife and
husband or how did you imagine this?

127
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:57,826
Why me?

128
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:03,903
Because my parents would
accept you. You are Turk.

129
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,708
What's going on?

130
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:16,419
Get off!

131
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:17,857
Why?

132
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,022
l said: Get off!

133
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:20,424
Why?

134
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,780
Because in my bus.

135
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,863
There is no space for godless
dogs like you guys!

136
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:28,542
Get off, you too!

137
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,709
What's going on?

138
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,025
That's not even your bus.
It belongs to the city council.

139
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,179
Piss off!

140
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,061
Hey wait!

141
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,587
What’s your name?

142
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,097
She has a window to the street.

143
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:14,897
Her admirers throw little
stones on her windows.

144
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:22,902
My dear is the one
with the most beautiful eyebrows.

145
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:30,218
Look for a lover too

146
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:34,178
and sum up your bride money.

147
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,344
Tell me, are you completely insane?

148
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:15,980
Are you an actrice?
Do you want an Oscar?

149
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,261
You do not understand that:
She is in troubles.

150
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,188
That's non of your business

151
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,821
I don't know?
Otherwise she wants to kill herself.

152
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,426
Bullshit!
As if that would be so easy.

153
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:33,705
That's women!

154
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:37,146
In order to soft-soap you,
they tell stories.

155
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,187
Do you know what it means to get married?
- No, I don't know.

156
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,062
Problems!

157
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:44,027
Look at me. Am I married?

158
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,665
No. I don't owe anyone anything
and I live in peace.

159
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,184
You lie. You got married!

160
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,700
That's different.
That was in order to stay here.

161
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:56,708
Basically that's the same.

162
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,899
Then get married,
for gods sake!

163
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:04,188
God blesses you! I'll be at
the wedding and dance with you.

164
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,182
One more thing...
- What?

165
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,499
Birsen?
- What?

166
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:30,380
Do you know this guy?
- No, but our daughter knows him.

167
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,461
She knows him then.

168
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:36,100
How can you give our daughter
to a foreigner?

169
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:41,667
She made many mistakes.
Maybe it becomes better now.

170
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,380
She made mistakes,
because you spoiled her like that.

171
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,620
Since she was a little child!

172
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:52,261
When do they come?
- Whether you want or not: Tomorrow.

173
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,181
Tomorrow already?

174
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,704
They are supposed to come,
for gods sake!

175
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:05,382
You only get us into trouble!

176
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:09,426
From which city
do we come once again?

177
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:11,625
From Mersin.

178
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,940
Not Malatya?
- No, man. It was Mersin.

179
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:17,781
Fuck your Mersin.

180
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:20,862
Friends, what's wrong with you?

181
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:23,938
That's not you fucking business!

182
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,701
Do you have to yell like this?
- Hurry, I'm queued too.

183
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:32,066
Just a second.
- How do you talk with me?

184
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,823
Sorry. Never mind.

185
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,383
Ok.

186
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,143
There is no alcohol
in the chocolates, right?

187
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,067
No.
- Sure?

188
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:47,545
Do you wanna bullshit me?

189
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,067
Really? - Holy shit,
there's no alcohol in there!

190
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:55,581
Fuck your alcohol!
With alcohol they are too expensive anyway.

191
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:58,781
Don't yell at me!
That was just a question!

192
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,704
You ask 100 times the same shit!

193
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,065
Which house number?
- 8.

194
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,698
How does you hair look like?
- That's new fashion.

195
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:11,225
That is a proposal and
you look like a fag!

196
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:14,427
They wont give you their daughter like this!

197
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:18,423
What was the name once again?
- Güner.

198
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,621
So you are the uncle of Cahit?

199
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:33,463
Yes... That means,
I'm his youngest uncle.

200
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,898
How many siblings are you then?

201
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:43,222
Ehm... just a second... we are a lot...

202
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,181
Seven.
- Yes, seven.

203
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:47,658
Respect!

204
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:50,659
You are your nephew all over.

205
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:56,944
May be.

206
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:58,503
Where do your parents live?

207
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,221
My parents are... dead.

208
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:07,788
My condolence.

209
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,388
Thanks.

210
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,381
Do you have any siblings?

211
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:18,185
Yes,
I have a sister in Frankfurt.

212
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:20,384
Don't you see each other?

213
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:24,499
Yeah...once in a while.

214
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:27,143
You don't have a proper Turkish!
What happened?

215
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,943
I dumped it.

216
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:34,379
That was a joke!

217
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,577
Is there any alcohol in
the chocolates?

218
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,468
No, no! Of course not.

219
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,308
Where do you come from?

220
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:53,139
From Malatya.

221
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:55,028
From Mersin.

222
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:59,501
That's because, a part of the family comes
from Mersin, the other part from Malatya.

223
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:03,227
They moved from Mersin
to Malatya...

224
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,063
What a scattered family!
- Yes, exactly!

225
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:15,827
Thank you.
- l hope it tasted good.

226
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,021
Where did you meet my sister?

227
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:28,778
I work in the hospital.

228
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:35,068
Cahit visits me there from time to time...
like two or three times a week...

229
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:38,786
Once he visited me and saw Sibel.

230
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:42,740
Well and then we decided to buy chocolate.

231
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:49,463
You are the manager of a factory?
- Yes.

232
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:54,385
Actually I'm the manager of 'the' factory.

233
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,385
That's an event and culture location in Altona.

234
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,747
I'm the boss there.
- I will come and visit you.

235
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,184
Yes you are welcome.

236
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:06,102
Isn't he a little bit too old for you?

237
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:08,621
I like him.

238
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,301
Couldn't you find a better one?

239
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:25,622
We ate and drank.
Thanks a lot. - You're welcome.

240
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,707
Let's get to the main topic.

241
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,468
We came,

242
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:36,622
with God's permission

243
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:40,141
for my nephew Cahit

244
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,789
to ask you for the hand of your daughter.

245
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,981
Sibel!

246
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:55,304
Yes, father...

247
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:58,667
Did you decide?

248
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:04,461
Yes, father.

249
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:14,587
What can we do?

250
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:19,505
When two young people agree

251
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:21,985
and like each other.

252
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,346
What shall we say?

253
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:31,346
God bless you.
- Thank you.

254
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:34,902
Cahit, kiss your father's hand.

255
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,019
Thanks.

256
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,546
I'm coming already!

257
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:08,179
Are you crazy?
- Hi Cahit.

258
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,620
Do you have coffee?

259
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:26,020
The coffee machine is gone.

260
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:31,821
Tell me, a Turkish mariage
costs a shitload of money, right?

261
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:34,379
Who is going to pay that?
- I got the money.

262
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,305
Where from? - I always knew that one day I will
run away from home. So I saved money.

263
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,859
Damn, why didn't you do it?

264
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,543
Because of my mother.
- Oh yea.

265
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,543
Is your sister going to come?
- No.

266
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,184
Why? - That's none of your fucking business.

267
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:58,786
Who is your witness to a marriage?
Your brother?

268
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:03,182
My cousin Selma from Istanbul.
She's hot you know ... - I don't fucking care

269
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,023
And she brings a pack of Turks with her?

270
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,465
No, she comes alone. She is divorced.

271
00:27:08,949 --> 00:27:12,021
To get rid of me we could do the same thing.
- Good idea.

272
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,627
Here you are! - What's that?
- I guessed so I don't know if it fits.

273
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,424
You guessed right.

274
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,625
I missed you!
- How was your flight?

275
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:47,940
They searched me again for drugs.

276
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:50,828
Where is my brother-in-law?
- He's busy...

277
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,948
Let me have a look. Your ass became nice.

278
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,942
Where did you meet?

279
00:27:58,189 --> 00:28:00,783
That's a long story.
- Tell...

280
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,338
Where should I begin?
- At the beginning.

281
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:26,307
Selma.
- Cahit.

282
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,582
Take care of them.

283
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,141
Thanks. - What shall I do now?
Kiss you? - Later

284
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:42,664
What?
- Later.

285
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:50,179

287
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,665
Is that correct?
- Yes.

288
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,506

289
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:04,743

Is that correct?

290
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:09,061
Yes that is correct.
- Then you can go for the wedding ceremony.

291
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:10,822
How did you wife die?

292
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:14,268
Cahit!
- Shut the fuck up! Am I clear?

293
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,144
What's going on?
- I didn't understand.

294
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,823
Don't you speak German?
- Yes I Do.

295
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:26,784

299
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:45,741
Cahit we have to dance.
- I don't dance.

300
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:51,907
But we have to!
- No we don't, ok?

301
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:54,498
Please Cahit.

302
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,306

00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,419
You German slut.
- Yes that's me.

00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:48,257
What's that.
- That's your room.

306
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:53,782

Yes.

310
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,380
Don't you wanna carry me into the room?

311
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,268
Hoppaa!

312
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:25,227
May I ask you a question?
- yea sure.

313
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,261
How was your wife called?

314
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:35,187
What's up?

315
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:39,179
Get lost!

316
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:42,786
Piss off now!

317
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:50,944
Katharina.

318
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:03,980
Get me another one.
- Actually I wanted to close down now.

319
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:06,742
Already?

320
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:09,703
Well everything has to come to an end?

321
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:36,664
Do you know where I can sleep tonight?

322
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:38,742
How about your husband?

323
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:42,619
He drove me off.
- Super...

324
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:57,220
Well if you want...

325
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:00,101
You can sleep at my place.

326
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:04,783
But only if you want.

327
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:09,059
Are you aware that you steal a bride?

328
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:32,619
You mustn't get married,
there are so many alternatives.

329
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,941
Tell me one.

330
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:39,106
You could have studied.
in of another city.

331
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:43,178
As if I would have school-leaving examination... - you would have
being able to marry someone else.

332
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:45,226
Not such a tramp!

333
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,901
I'm too young to become married
seriously and to become housewife!

334
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,468
Come to me.

335
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,388
To Istanbul.

336
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:20,988
Oh my god that's a girlie room.

337
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,504
That's incredible.

338
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,025
I cut off your cock soon!

339
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:28,059
What did all this cost?

340
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,106
Enough to go bankrupt.

341
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,387
And who pays the rent?
- I don't know.

342
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:39,298
I wont pay your part.

343
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:47,109
Could you finally stop moving?

344
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,908
Let, ...

345
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:55,425
Do you want to make a model out of me.

346
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:10,219
Fine.

347
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:11,744
Done.

348
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:16,378
Take a shower.

349
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:35,420
Can I help you, Maren?

350
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,380
Are you in a good or in a bad mood?

351
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:55,828
Both.

352
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:05,423
Thanks.

353
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:06,744
You're welcome.

354
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:01,341
Who cut them?

355
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,746
My roommate.

356
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,464
Since when do you have a roommate?

357
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:14,548
Since a couple of days.

358
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:16,860
Do you fuck?
- No.

359
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,578
What?
- No.

360
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:23,822
Is she nice?

361
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:30,866
she needs a job.

362
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:48,466
Hi I'm Sibel.

363
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,941
You're Cahit's flat mate right?
- Yes.

364
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:58,660
You're looking for a job?
- Yes, I'm I a good hair stylist.

365
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:00,943
Well then...

366
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,183
Hello, I've got an appointment for 11 o'clock.
- yes, take a seat.

367
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:08,987
Do you want?
- Yes.

368
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:15,099
Is it ok if she does it?
- Sure no problem.

369
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:17,625
Thanks. How do you like it?

370
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:20,708
Just cut the ends.
- Ok.

371
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:25,062
Shall I wash them?
- No, I just did and they are still wet.

372
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,941
That looks hot right!
- Yeah, yeah!

373
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,540
Next thing is a tattoo!
Such a huge one!

374
00:40:58,949 --> 00:40:59,904
Yeah!

375
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:05,105
Maren is a hot chick!
- Yes!

376
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:08,740
She has a hot ass?
- Yeah I think so too!

377
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:11,623
She has a really hot ass.

378
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:20,187
Do you like my piercing?
- yes!

379
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:23,184
Yes it is hot, really hot!

380
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:27,059
Do you want to go dancing with me.
- Yea sure.

381
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:29,266
I want to show off with you.

382
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:33,344
But I say at whom ok?

383
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:35,188
Ok!

384
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:49,181
Cahit, I go to fuck!

385
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:52,580
Did you see the guy?

386
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:09,506
How many heads did you wash
to afford this car?

387
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:12,742
Yilmaz has connections. He gets it cheaper.

388
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,663
Do I really have to join you?
Bullshit!

389
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:20,305
We are married for half a year now
and we have never been there.

390
00:46:20,669 --> 00:46:24,457
I don't wanna, I don’t wanna!
- Oh please Cahit!

391
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:27,300
Fuck your 'oh please'.

392
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:29,982
Your Turkish really improves!

393
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:36,865
It's your turn, play!

394
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:36,865
It's your turn
- Yea brother I play!

395
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:40,227
Whether take this or this!

396
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:44,424
How could you give your girl to him?

397
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:47,741
Do not interfere in ours
family affairs!

398
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:51,978
Hey guys. Last week I was at the "Pasha"
A very nice club. Everything available there.

399
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,738
Scandinavian, African ...

400
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:57,902
Turkish? - My cellar is full of Turks.

401
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:02,139
Play brother.

402
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:05,222
You have to come with us!

403
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:04,148
Brother-in-law!

404
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:08,103
Where to?

405
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:09,578
To a Brothel.

406
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:12,024
What shall I do in a brothel?

407
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:14,941
What a question!

408
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:17,306
Do you know the brother
of Michael Jackson ?

409
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:21,019
Siki Ceksin
(you will fuck)

410
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,582
Why don't you fuck your own wives?

411
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:37,427
What did you say?

412
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:44,945
Why you don't fuck your own wives?
It's your turn.

413
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:52,227
Do not ever say the word 'fuck'
together with our wives again!

414
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:56,099
Did you understand me?
- What?

415
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:59,541
As much as you understood me?
- Calm down.

416
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:04,785
Galatasaray becomes master.

417
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:22,539
What the fuck?
I kick you in the ass!

418
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:24,706
I fucking hit you!
- Calm down!

419
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:32,267
And how is your husband like?

420
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:34,178
Very sweet.

421
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:35,984
And in bed?

422
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:38,904
Okay.

423
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:40,983
Does he suck?

424
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,267
Like a cat.

425
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:46,744
You can be glad!

426
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:52,183
Mine sux like an ox
and sometimes he moos.

427
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:02,383
Hey wait a second.

428
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:07,138
I was at the factory.

429
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:10,859
You are not the manager there ...

430
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:13,908
you just clean the tables.

431
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:16,460
Why did you lie?

432
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:21,463
Imagine if you were me.

433
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:24,380
You clean the fucking tables.

434
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:29,618
Would you have given me your sister?

435
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:35,182
Do you love her?

436
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:39,184
Yes.

437
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:42,188
I love her.

438
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,579
Can I get another beer please?

439
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:03,777
Make it two.

440
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:07,943
And I'm looking at him and
ask what’s going on

441
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:12,268
because he has totally
cauterized eyebrows.

442
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:16,742
he said he's lovesick

443
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,867
Do you want one more?
- No, thanks.

444
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:31,827
I could tell you some nice stories.

445
00:50:32,189 --> 00:50:34,498
Really?
- Yes. - I'd love to.

446
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:38,538
At my place...

447
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:42,948
Do you live nearby?
- Yes around the corner.

448
00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:53,984
Hey!

449
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,746
You do one mistake after another!

450
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:30,781
You are fine right.

451
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:35,425
Why?

452
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:37,507
You fuck better.

453
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:17,064
It wasn't a bad idea to marry you.

454
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:20,500
I learned it from my mother.

455
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:33,384
Ah... My mother asked me
about children today.

456
00:53:41,149 --> 00:53:43,060
Let's make some.

457
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,986
If it's getting too worse I tell
here you are infertile.

458
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:52,259
That's a good divorce reason.

459
00:53:54,909 --> 00:53:57,059
Do you want to go at the "Taksim" tonight?

460
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:42,184
Hello.

461
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:47,300
A whiskey please.

462
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,508
What's that?

463
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:05,224
Thanks.

464
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,261
Did you see her?
- whom?

465
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:19,903
My wife.

466
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:24,988
That little girl is your wife?
- Yes, and?

467
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:29,748
Why do you look like this?

468
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:31,861
I thought you two don't fuck.

469
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:35,587
We don't fuck, actually.

470
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:44,062
Why don't you fuck
if you are married?

471
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,186
I want to get in there.

472
00:56:13,587 --> 00:56:18,138
Sorry but without a girl you can't enter.
- My wife is in there.

473
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:21,305
I don't give a fuck.
- You don't? - Exactly.

474
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:25,097
Fuck you!
- Hey, fuck you. - No, no.

475
00:56:24,867 --> 00:56:26,141
Hold on.

476
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:27,781
That's my husband.

477
00:56:28,187 --> 00:56:31,099
Ok, that's your husband.

478
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:33,422
But calm down.

479
00:56:33,787 --> 00:56:36,540
Don't make a riot in there.
- ok.

480
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:39,498
It's ok guys.

481
00:56:39,907 --> 00:56:40,862
Peace!

482
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:50,502
Sibel!

483
00:56:56,187 --> 00:57:00,021
I'm sorry that I ran away.

484
00:57:01,307 --> 00:57:03,059
It's ok.

485
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:05,378
I've gone crazy?

486
00:57:06,307 --> 00:57:07,706
Everybody does.

487
00:57:40,907 --> 00:57:44,946
Hey babe. Are you all right?
- What do you want? - Can't you see I want you!

488
00:57:45,347 --> 00:57:47,622
Piss off!
- Hey, keep cool babe!

489
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:51,138
Hey, that's my wife.
- What? - Cahit!

490
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:53,782
What Cahit...
Hold on!

491
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:15,365
Your face isn't blessed that much.

492
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,005
I just try to look good.

493
00:58:34,651 --> 00:58:35,800
Bastards.

494
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:39,240
Why? You are one of them.

495
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:54,362
I know so little from you.

496
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,122
Then get to know me better.

497
01:00:45,051 --> 01:00:46,325
Stop!

498
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:49,086
Stop it! Stop!

499
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:53,689
I can't! I can't!

500
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:58,560
If we do it you are my husband
and I am your wife.

501
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:01,166
Do you understand?

502
01:01:09,371 --> 01:01:10,804
I'm in love!

503
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:14,650
In love!

504
01:01:15,331 --> 01:01:16,764
She bewitched me.

505
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:20,402
Stop it boy!
I say stop it!

506
01:01:22,571 --> 01:01:25,563
Forget your love.
Look how you look like!

507
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:28,128
Do you even know what love is?

508
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:31,367
Love is a carousel!

509
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:37,921
Always in a circle,
but you only have a wooden horse!

510
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:44,529
You don't understand!
You don't understand!

511
01:02:43,171 --> 01:02:45,002
She was called Katharina.

512
01:02:45,371 --> 01:02:47,282
A very happy person.

513
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:51,002
Like a kid.

514
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:54,324
She always smiled.

515
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:57,889
Everybody liked her.

516
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:02,121
I really liked her.

517
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:06,165
What did she do?
- She painted.

518
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,884
Did Cahit love her?

519
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:17,005
Yes, a lot.

520
01:03:21,891 --> 01:03:24,121
What a strange relationship
do you have to him?

521
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:29,686
He is my husband and I am his wife.

522
01:03:32,411 --> 01:03:34,242
Do you love each other?

523
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:36,883
You wouldn't understand that.

524
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:41,207
Yea I guess I'm too stupid.

525
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:46,366
I don't even understand it.

526
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:53,521
Cahit and I fuck
from time to time.

527
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:12,088
Sibel!
- What are you doing here?

528
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,169
I wanted to see you.
- Why?

529
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:21,324
Niko, listen. We slept together.
I wanted to know how you are in bed.

530
01:04:21,851 --> 01:04:25,082
Now I know it.
You step aside and I do, ok?

531
01:04:25,451 --> 01:04:27,965
What's this? - Get your fingers off me!
I'm a married woman.

532
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:31,767
I'm a married Turkish woman and if you come to close
my husband kills you. Understood?

533
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:52,722
When did she marry?

534
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,960
Tell me, what a bad
husband are you!

535
01:05:57,091 --> 01:06:00,322
Your girl hangs out
and you don't care.

536
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:05,162
Do you even fuck her?

537
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,883
Ah?

538
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:11,122
You are a pimp right?

539
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:15,288
Fuck you!
- Niko, you talk to much.

540
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:18,202
Do you earn enough money with her pussy?

541
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:23,370
Tell me...

542
01:06:25,051 --> 01:06:27,929
How much would it cost to
fuck her in the ass?

543
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:33,123
50 Euros are enough?

544
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,885
In the brothel it's called 'Greek'?

545
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:41,406
I want to fuck a Turk
in the Greek way!

546
01:06:47,491 --> 01:06:48,446
Niko!

547
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:51,006
Niko!

548
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:56,809
Call a doctor!

549
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:52,244
ACT OF JEALOUSY IN ST. PAULI

550
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:28,126
Listen,
you cant stay here.

551
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:31,444
You have to leave tomorrow morning.
Without being seen.

552
01:10:31,771 --> 01:10:33,841
Otherwise they tear me to pieces!

553
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,170
Did you understand me?

554
01:10:41,131 --> 01:10:42,200
Yes.

555
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:47,003
Isn't there anybody you could go to?
Give me an answer!

556
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:48,761
No.

557
01:10:52,011 --> 01:10:53,888
Holy shit!

558
01:10:57,091 --> 01:10:59,366
And what do you want to do now?

559
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:03,810
They will kill me.

560
01:11:04,171 --> 01:11:07,322
Who?
- My family.

561
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:13,767
Your family!
What do you expect?

562
01:11:14,051 --> 01:11:17,327
You mess up all the time and then:
"My family..."!

563
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:19,808
There must be someone in Turkey?

564
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:23,523
Yes I do...
- Go there.

565
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:26,080
And what about Cahit?

566
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,845
What does Cahit bother you?

567
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:32,079
Can't you see what you
have done to him?

568
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:35,291
You ruined his life!

569
01:11:36,371 --> 01:11:37,963
"And Cahit"!

570
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:45,606
Listen,

571
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,241
you really love Cahit?

572
01:11:53,691 --> 01:11:54,646
Yes.

573
01:11:55,931 --> 01:11:58,923
Then do him a favor:

574
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:00,646
Go!

575
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:29,362
Why do you cry,
black haired beauty?

576
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:43,329
Everything the appears
disappears again. Don't cry.

577
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:50,244
Even if your lament
climbs up to the sky.

578
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:56,920
Everything the appears
disappears again. Don't cry.

579
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:18,489
What ever happens,
after every winter there comes spring.

580
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:26,524
Everything the appears
disappears again. Don't cry.

581
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:44,961
Please do not hand over or
take over things.

582
01:13:45,371 --> 01:13:48,010
Please don't talk about the
actual case either.

583
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:50,561
Please close the door.

584
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:33,930
I will wait for you.

585
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:10,007
Fasten you seatbelt, Sibel.

586
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:17,004
Your hair looks beautiful!

587
01:16:19,411 --> 01:16:20,890
Are you hungry?

588
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:22,366
No.

589
01:16:27,931 --> 01:16:29,967
What do you want to do now?

590
01:16:31,531 --> 01:16:33,010
Can you get me a job?

591
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:34,920
In a hairdresser's salon?

592
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:38,765
I don't care.

593
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,889
We will see...

594
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:46,682
Smile!

595
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,765
How is it going?

596
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:04,361
Fine.

597
01:17:07,171 --> 01:17:08,729
Sibel, don't worry.

598
01:17:08,971 --> 01:17:11,087
It's just for a short while.

599
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:14,162
I'm waiting for barber
Ahmet's reply.

600
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:17,721
As soon as there is a job
needed you're in.

601
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:26,285
Take care!
I'm right there!

602
01:17:30,491 --> 01:17:32,049
Do you like the hotel?

603
01:17:37,891 --> 01:17:39,961
Shall I tell you a secret?

604
01:17:40,571 --> 01:17:44,359
One day I will be
responsible for all this.

605
01:17:45,011 --> 01:17:48,640
In a few years I will
manage the hotel...

606
01:17:49,771 --> 01:17:52,205
Then you can work here.
!

607
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:54,004
How do you like that?

608
01:17:56,451 --> 01:17:58,919
You can only trust yourself

609
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:07,529
Can I get a Raki?

610
01:18:19,451 --> 01:18:21,123
Do you miss Cahit?

611
01:18:50,251 --> 01:18:51,843
Go for it, Sibel!

612
01:19:58,011 --> 01:20:01,686
I go to that date and
enter the elevator.

613
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:07,801
That's an old building with
elevators from the 80ies.

614
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:13,962
You reach the top but you can't open the door.
There is a wall...

615
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,683
You are not from here right?

616
01:20:34,491 --> 01:20:36,243
How do you know?

617
01:20:36,691 --> 01:20:38,170
l just know it.

618
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:42,690
Listen guys...

619
01:20:45,611 --> 01:20:48,330
Where can I get drugs?

620
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:51,327
You are crazy?

621
01:21:12,771 --> 01:21:13,760
Where have you been?

622
01:21:14,171 --> 01:21:16,321
Hanging out.
- Where?

623
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,602
My business.
- Sibel!

624
01:21:31,371 --> 01:21:32,770
My dear husband,

625
01:21:33,171 --> 01:21:35,321
A few weeks have passed
since I'm here.

626
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:38,450
Istanbul is a colorful city.
Full of live.

627
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:40,603
The only one who isn't alive is me.

628
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:43,487
All I do is trying to survive.

629
01:21:47,051 --> 01:21:50,123
Allah is testing us. Allah?

630
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:54,370
Allah? I don't know how to believe in him
after everything that has happened.

631
01:21:54,771 --> 01:21:58,161
You got the harder lot

632
01:21:58,571 --> 01:22:01,563
But prison is the only thing that I can
think of if I think of my live here.

633
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:05,759
I'm working as maid at the Marmora hotel.
Selma got me the job.

634
01:22:06,531 --> 01:22:08,999
Selma, who I admired so much.

635
01:22:09,411 --> 01:22:12,323
Now there's only contempt.

636
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:14,443
I hope you are fine.

637
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:16,123
Hugs and kisses. Sibel

638
01:22:47,091 --> 01:22:48,490
Are you looking for somebody?

639
01:22:50,771 --> 01:22:51,965
I'm looking for drugs.

640
01:22:58,371 --> 01:22:59,360
What drugs?

641
01:23:01,171 --> 01:23:02,240
Doesn't matter.

642
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:30,845
What's that?
- Opium.

643
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:36,724
You want to try it out?

644
01:23:39,691 --> 01:23:41,522
Give it to me.

645
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:46,609
Hit...

646
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:04,801
You can work for me...

647
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:11,162
You can live here too
if you want...

648
01:24:21,691 --> 01:24:23,966
What's up?
- I’m moving.

649
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:28,370
Where do you want to go to?
- I met a few people.

650
01:24:28,851 --> 01:24:30,170
What kind of people?

651
01:24:31,411 --> 01:24:35,484
Just people...
- Sibel. Don't go.

652
01:24:36,411 --> 01:24:39,608
To become like you?
Working, sleeping, working...

653
01:24:39,851 --> 01:24:43,685
That's why you got divorced!

654
01:26:12,491 --> 01:26:13,810
Sibel!

655
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,729
Yes...

656
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,809
Go!

657
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:44,449
Hey, babe!

658
01:26:44,851 --> 01:26:47,843
What are you doing on the
street at this time?

659
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:49,445
Did you get lost?

660
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:53,924
Do you need a man?
Hold on!

661
01:26:56,971 --> 01:27:00,327
Go home and fuck your mothers!

662
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:02,484
Stop laughing!

663
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:10,006
Bitch!

664
01:27:18,771 --> 01:27:20,489
That's enough! That's enough!

665
01:27:34,451 --> 01:27:37,443
Son of a bitch!
That's all you got?

666
01:27:37,691 --> 01:27:39,363
Girl, piss off!

667
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:43,207
I fuck you now!

668
01:27:45,091 --> 01:27:47,207
Who do you want to fuck?

669
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:51,805
Enough? Is it enough now?

670
01:28:17,491 --> 01:28:19,766
Fuck you and your families!

671
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:22,602
What was that?

672
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:24,405
Fags!

673
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:28,245
Son of a bitch!

674
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,165
Come here!

675
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:39,370
Holy shit!

676
01:28:41,451 --> 01:28:44,011
Oh my God I killed her!

677
01:28:44,851 --> 01:28:46,284
Damnit, shit!

678
01:28:47,251 --> 01:28:50,482
Did you want that, did you want that?

679
01:28:51,611 --> 01:28:52,646
Run brother!

680
01:28:52,931 --> 01:28:53,841
Get away!

681
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:56,805
Get away!

682
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:19,321
Does it taste good?

683
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:23,328
very good!
- Isn't it?

684
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:27,565
They have good skewers here.
That's why I come often.

685
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:30,441
Cheers!

686
01:30:30,971 --> 01:30:32,689
Cheers, Seref!

687
01:30:43,691 --> 01:30:45,522
What do you want to do now?

688
01:30:46,411 --> 01:30:47,764
I'm going to Istanbul.

689
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,126
To Sibel?

690
01:30:52,691 --> 01:30:53,760
Yes.

691
01:30:56,691 --> 01:30:58,807
Didn't you learn anything?

692
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:02,357
Hasn't she caused you enough pain already?

693
01:31:03,531 --> 01:31:09,083
Without her I wouldn't have made it.

694
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:11,330
Made what?

695
01:31:15,211 --> 01:31:16,929
Stay alive!

696
01:31:28,811 --> 01:31:30,164
Good.

697
01:31:33,891 --> 01:31:35,404
Take that!

698
01:31:36,531 --> 01:31:38,806
What's that?
- Take it!

699
01:31:45,491 --> 01:31:47,083
I saved it for you!

700
01:31:47,331 --> 01:31:50,607
Take it and got to Turkey!

701
01:31:51,891 --> 01:31:54,200
I can't!
- Take it now!

702
01:31:55,131 --> 01:31:56,246
No.

703
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:01,368
I’m sorry I can't.
- Stop that bullshit!

704
01:32:01,611 --> 01:32:05,809
I'm your uncle. Do you remember?

705
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:13,326
Let's go to Turkey.

706
01:32:22,051 --> 01:32:22,961
Thank you!

707
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:38,844
Brother-in-law?

708
01:32:42,331 --> 01:32:44,083
Where is your sister?

709
01:32:46,651 --> 01:32:48,528
I don't have a sister.

710
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:51,968
But you have the same mother?

711
01:32:56,411 --> 01:32:58,083
How does your mother deal with it?

712
01:33:00,091 --> 01:33:02,047
We had to protect our reputation.

713
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:03,930
You see.

714
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:05,886
And?

715
01:33:06,891 --> 01:33:09,007
Did you protect you reputation?

716
01:33:39,731 --> 01:33:41,210
Where to?

717
01:33:42,931 --> 01:33:43,920
I don’t know.

718
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:48,762
If you don't even know it how should I know it?
- Go straight ahead!

719
01:33:50,371 --> 01:33:51,645
Okay.

720
01:33:53,251 --> 01:33:55,287
Where are you from?

721
01:33:56,651 --> 01:33:59,802
Hamburg.
- You are from Hamburg?

722
01:34:01,411 --> 01:34:05,086
Yes. - Hey, I'm from Munich!
- Oh my god you are Bavarian?

723
01:34:05,491 --> 01:34:08,608
Well in my last life I used to.
But now I'm here.

724
01:34:08,971 --> 01:34:10,689
They deported me.

725
01:34:11,091 --> 01:34:14,561
Deported, you know!

726
01:34:15,891 --> 01:34:18,485
Why?
- Drugs.

727
01:34:19,371 --> 01:34:20,724
Oh yea.

728
01:34:22,371 --> 01:34:24,168
How shall I continue? Right, left?

729
01:34:24,571 --> 01:34:27,404
Say something.

730
01:34:27,811 --> 01:34:30,245
Get me to a cheap hotel.

731
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:34,002
There is... Ehm!

732
01:34:34,411 --> 01:34:39,201
Exactly the right thing for your,
"Grand Hotel London."

733
01:34:46,411 --> 01:34:49,687
Under friends...
There are ghosts in this house.

734
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:21,688
The set up is ok.
You placed the logo at the right place,

735
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:26,528
But in this sample it's too little.
I want it larger.

736
01:35:26,851 --> 01:35:29,319
I don't like the font.

737
01:35:29,571 --> 01:35:32,131
We have to choose one of those.

738
01:35:32,411 --> 01:35:34,242
Do you have another sample?

739
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:37,051
There's somebody who wants
to talk to you. - Who?

740
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:46,328
Could we continue later?
- Sure.

741
01:35:57,931 --> 01:35:59,410
Hello Selma.

742
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:01,921
Welcome.

743
01:36:02,891 --> 01:36:03,880
Thanks.

744
01:36:05,131 --> 01:36:06,280
Take a seat.

745
01:36:07,131 --> 01:36:08,246
Yes please.

746
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:19,647
I hope you came out of
it alive! - Thanks.

747
01:36:22,211 --> 01:36:23,439
How are you?

748
01:36:25,411 --> 01:36:28,403
Good. And you?

749
01:36:29,411 --> 01:36:31,003
As you can see...

750
01:36:31,371 --> 01:36:33,601
I'm still single...

751
01:36:40,651 --> 01:36:43,324
Could I have a glass of water?
- Pardon.

752
01:36:44,611 --> 01:36:48,684
A glass of water for the gentleman please
and red wine for me.

753
01:36:55,211 --> 01:36:56,326
That's for you.

754
01:36:56,891 --> 01:36:59,849
That's not necessary.
- It's not worth to be mentioned.

755
01:37:00,091 --> 01:37:02,127
Thank you. Where do you live?

756
01:37:02,811 --> 01:37:04,722
At "Grand hotel London".

757
01:37:05,531 --> 01:37:08,170
A nice hotel.
- It's not bad.

758
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:14,600
Thanks.

759
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:22,245
Where is Sibel?

760
01:37:24,851 --> 01:37:26,842
She is here. In Istanbul.

761
01:37:30,931 --> 01:37:33,286
I want to meet her. Please.

762
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:36,129
That's not possible.
- Why?

763
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:39,600
She has a new life.
She is happy.

764
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:42,280
She has a friend.
She has a daughter.

765
01:37:42,531 --> 01:37:44,408
She doesn't need you.

766
01:38:44,531 --> 01:38:48,206
I got lost long time before.

767
01:39:19,331 --> 01:39:20,730
Do you understand?

768
01:39:51,491 --> 01:39:52,480
No.

769
01:39:55,131 --> 01:39:56,644
I am not.

770
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:58,206
Hello?

771
01:41:00,611 --> 01:41:01,566
Hello?

772
01:41:02,451 --> 01:41:03,406
Cahit?

773
01:41:09,851 --> 01:41:10,806
Sibel?

774
01:41:13,411 --> 01:41:16,642
I can't talk at the moment.
How long are you in town?

775
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:19,525
Until I have seen you.

776
01:41:23,371 --> 01:41:24,326
Hello?

777
01:42:18,331 --> 01:42:20,447
There's is a call for you.

778
01:42:26,411 --> 01:42:28,686
Cem is in Zonguldak for 2 days.

779
01:42:32,931 --> 01:42:35,570
I don't come home tonight.

780
01:42:43,611 --> 01:42:45,169
Could you take care of Pamuk?

781
01:42:45,651 --> 01:42:52,170
Sweetie, are you staying with me?

782
01:42:56,331 --> 01:42:59,289
Maybe I won't be back tomorrow either.

783
01:43:00,491 --> 01:43:03,403
But you come back some time right?

784
01:43:15,651 --> 01:43:17,960
I hope you know what you do.

785
01:43:20,531 --> 01:43:23,045
No, I don't.

786
01:43:25,731 --> 01:43:28,165
I wish you all the best.

787
01:44:24,771 --> 01:44:26,363
What do you want to do?

788
01:44:28,531 --> 01:44:33,082
Do you want to stay in Istanbul?
- Me in Istanbul? Of course not.

789
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:38,087
I go to Mersin. Where I am born.

790
01:44:41,211 --> 01:44:43,008
I don't worry.

791
01:44:44,171 --> 01:44:45,524
Good.

792
01:45:05,931 --> 01:45:08,650
Come with me?

793
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:31,843
Let's go back.

794
01:46:31,091 --> 01:46:32,570
It's me.

795
01:46:33,331 --> 01:46:34,844
Fine.

796
01:46:36,411 --> 01:46:38,288
What is Pamuk doing?

797
01:46:39,411 --> 01:46:41,288
I want to talk to her.

798
01:46:52,131 --> 01:46:53,803
How shall we do it?

799
01:46:57,291 --> 01:46:59,680
We meet tomorrow at the bus station.

800
01:47:02,051 --> 01:47:04,645
From there we go to Mersin.

801
01:47:07,611 --> 01:47:08,566
You,

802
01:47:09,611 --> 01:47:11,522
your daughter and I.

803
01:47:48,931 --> 01:47:51,206
When?
- 12 o'clock.

804
01:49:55,731 --> 01:50:05,686
Over there on the mountain.
There is a light fire.

805
01:50:18,091 --> 01:50:33,359
Falcons are flying over its glimmer light.

806
01:50:34,691 --> 01:50:39,162
Is everyone who is missing his darling

807
01:50:39,451 --> 01:50:44,445
insane like I am?

808
01:50:57,091 --> 01:51:05,328
I'm endlessly sad.

809
01:51:05,771 --> 01:51:12,802
May my enemies get blind.

810
01:51:14,451 --> 01:51:22,324
I got mad.

811
01:51:23,131 --> 01:51:32,085
May the mountain rejoice instead of me.
