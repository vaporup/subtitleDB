1
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,442
 Okay. 

2
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:08,741
911 emergency. 

3
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,083
I need an ambulance.

4
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:19,783
I have you at 9212 west third street 
in los angeles. 

5
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:25,590
Yes, room number 2.

6
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,029
What's the emergency? 

7
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,531
There's been a suicide.

8
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,639
Who's the victim? 

9
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,237
I am.

10
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:49,783
In seven days, 
god created the world. 

11
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,287
And in seven seconds... 

12
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,493
... i shattered mine. 

13
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:59,081
- I can have four new fillets overnight. 
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

14
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:01,420
What is your name again? Ezra?
Is that right?

15
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:04,358
Yes, sir. I'll just need
your first and last name...

16
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:06,829
...so i can call up your account.
- You know what? 

17
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:10,936
Here's what i'm thinking, ezra. I think
i'm gonna mail you the meat back...

18
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:14,471
...so you can see firsthand the type
of dog food that you're peddling.

19
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:18,167
That won't be necessary, sir.

20
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:21,142
So how about we just start
with your last name?

21
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:22,542
Thomas.

22
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,614
And don't even get me started
on the pork.

23
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,979
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir. 

24
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:30,679
I'm not much of a meat eater myself,
but i hear really great things...

25
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,051
...about the pork.

26
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,490
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.

27
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:39,496
Are you jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, ezra?

28
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:46,162
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, mr. Thomas?

29
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,208
Ben.

30
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:55,512
Hold on, what was that voice?

31
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:59,049
I don't... i don't have an order
for a ben thomas.

32
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:01,653
Ezra, what was that voice?

33
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:04,346
- What voice?
- Are you blind?

34
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:07,083
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me. 

35
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:12,493
A blind beef salesman
who doesn't eat meat.

36
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,332
Now, that... that is rich. 
That is rich. 

37
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,334
Have you ever had sex, ezra?

38
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,009
Did lawrence in accounting
put you up to this?

39
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:27,476
Because somehow i can't imagine
the blind, vegan...

40
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,911
... beef salesman having sex. 

41
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:33,382
- Listen, i'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me? 

42
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:36,420
The blind beef salesman
is trying to help me?

43
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,615
I'm actually starting to feel
pretty bad for you, ezra.

44
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:43,956
Because i look at my life, and it is
surrounded by so much beauty...

45
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:47,327
... and you can't see shit. 

46
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,229
Is that fair?

47
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:51,063
Does that seem fair to you, ezra?

48
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:53,535
Do you even know
what color the ocean is?

49
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,968
Do you? 

50
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,910
- It's blue, sir.
- "it's blue, sir." 

51
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,374
Say what you wanna say.

52
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,548
React. 
Say what you wanna say to me. 

53
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,478
Thank you for calling
cheyenne meats.

54
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:08,485
That's not what you wanna say,
you coward. You coward.

55
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,716
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman,
virgin coward!

56
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:16,054
- Goodbye, mr. Thomas.
- Say what you wanna say. 

57
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,313

Yes. Hello, i'm looking for emily.

63
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,346
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.

64
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,918
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.

65
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:58,181
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.

66
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,687
She asked me to watch duke
until she got back.

67
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:03,857
Okay.

68
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:07,499
You ever try mixing banana peel
into the soil?

69
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,602
- Really?
- It works, i swear.

70
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:15,070
Oh, would you by chance
know where i could find her?

71
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,984
Supervisor to 104. 
Supervisor to 104. 

72
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:30,812
Cardiac wing?

73
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,390
Take the elevator to the fifth floor
then turn left.

74
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:35,356
Thank you.

75
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:41,667
Well, that's what i was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.

76
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,002
Hold the elevator.

77
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,673
Thank you.

78
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,389
Can i help you?

79
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,826
Yes. Good evening.

80
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,203
I'm here to see emily posa.

81
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:58,434
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are from 8 a.m. To 4 p.m.

82
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,705
You know, it is really important
i speak to her for just a moment.

83
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,545
You'll just have to come back
during visiting hours.

84
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:10,180
Thank you very much.

85
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,706
So if there is one thing
that i have learned...

86
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:10,712
...and you all should remember
about winning these contracts:

87
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:14,614
Three steps. First, tell them
what you're gonna tell them.

88
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,789
Step two, you tell them.

89
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,391
Step three,
tell them what you told them.

90
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,923
We are gonna close
by reminding them...

91
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,621
...that old girl has a 3-percent better
impulse from sea level to vacuum...

92
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,792
...and if they pass on that, quite
frankly, they deserve another sputnik.

93
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,034
Now, if you will excuse me...

94
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:41,805
...i have a very lovely, very hungry
woman at home waiting for me.

95
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:46,080
Sarah. 

96
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:50,745
Honey.

97
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:56,624
Everyone at work kept saying
it was daylight-savings time.

98
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,661
You were supposed
to be here a while ago.

99
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:02,028
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time. It's work.

100
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,465
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, i'm angry with you.

101
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:06,229
I'm gonna be angry all night long.

102
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,464
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?

103
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:11,508
How about that?
How about i'm angry with you?

104
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:26,748
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. It's your brother.

105
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:29,622
Where are you? 

106
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:32,597
I'm at the beach house.

107
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,267
Are you okay? 

108
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:38,170
Of course.

109
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:42,470
Listen, why'd you disconnect 
the landline? 

110
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,477
The phone broke.

111
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,943
I don't need it anymore. 

112
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:52,816
Did i? Did i do something?

113
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,714
No.

114
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:58,356
Not unless you're smoking again.

115
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:03,552
No, i've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

116
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,798
Are you eating? 
Are you taking care of yourself? 

117
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,936
- You sound terrible again and... 
- yeah, i'm fine. Look, i gotta go.

118
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:14,004
Give melanie and the kids
a hug and a kiss.

119
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,108
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.

120
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,406
Hold on. I know it's been a while,
but when you were staying here...

121
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:25,482
...you didn't take something of mine
by mistake, did you?

122
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,920
I remember giving you something.

123
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,883
You remember that?
Because i remember that very clearly.

124
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,524
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,495
Just remember i love you.

126
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:22,635
Hi, my name is ben thomas.
I'm here to see stewart goodman.

127
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:26,141
Inez, look at me, please.

128
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:29,841
Inez. I'm speaking to you.

129
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:35,246
I understand you refused to take
your meds again. Is that true?

130
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,150
No, no, no.

131
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:43,119
Let's try using your words
this time, okay, inez?

132
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,991
I mean, this silent treatment
isn't doing anybody any good.

133
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,497
Inez, how can we help you if...?

134
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,099
Okay, how about i come back
tomorrow...

135
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:55,206
...and see if you've changed
your mind, okay?

136
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,205
Thattagirl.

137
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,813
I thought i was coming
to your office today.

138
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:06,417
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
i'd stop by, save you the drive.

139
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:10,055
Terrific. Well, look, let's go talk
in my office, yeah? Come on.

140
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:11,621
I take a no-nonsense approach. 

141
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,054
I mean, i cut the operating costs
of this place...

142
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,854
...over 17 percent last year alone.

143
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:21,432
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

144
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,659
Now, if i could only get
my own finances...

145
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,600
...in that kind of shape,
i wouldn't have you sitting here.

146
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,034
No offense.

147
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,334
That your new beemer out front?

148
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,207
Ben, i mean, when i found out...

149
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:41,012
...that my bone-marrow transplant
wasn't successful...

150
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,781
i'm well aware of your
ongoing medical condition.

151
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,619
Things aren't looking
very promising for me.

152
00:15:51,064 --> 00:15:53,055
Look...

153
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,359
...i have a bonus coming in january.

154
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,833
I just really need
this six-month extension.

155
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:03,569
Really, i mean, i am doing the very
best i can here, i promise you.

156
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,686
I'm gonna show myself out.

157
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:18,346
I'll be in touch.

158
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:20,492
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

159
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:23,161
I mean, this way
everybody wins, right?

160
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:36,768
Hello.

161
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,347
My name is ben.

162
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:52,222
I totally understand
if you don't wanna speak to me either.

163
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:56,555
But i would really like
to just have a moment of your time.

164
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:20,809
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man stewart goodman is.

165
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:29,617
It is within my power to drastically
change his circumstances.

166
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:35,492
But i don't wanna give that man
a gift that he doesn't deserve.

167
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:42,840
I need you to tell me
whether or not he is a good person.

168
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,166
"The drug he gives me...

169
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,301
...makes me dizzy.

170
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,841
I want a new one."

171
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,246
Well, that sounds
very reasonable, inez.

172
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,714
What else?

173
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,857
You can trust me.

174
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,320
What else, inez?

175
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,677
He's punishing you?

176
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,712
How is he punishing you?

177
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,757
How is he punishing you, inez?

178
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:32,007
Ben?

179
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,249
- Hey, ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?

180
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:37,615
To the right. Is there a problem?

181
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:40,621
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.

182
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:43,989
Thank you. Thank you.

183
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,624
You have the wrong
impression here.

184
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,562
I'm gonna stop by
from time to time...

185
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:52,067
...make sure you're showing
these people some respect.

186
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,466
Look, this is
a misunderstanding, okay?

187
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,767
You don't treat people like that.

188
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,568
Let me explain, okay, ben?

189
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:00,712
- And i'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!

190
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:03,006
I'm not giving you anything.

191
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:06,250
I almost believed you,
you son of a bitch.

192
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,784
I almost believed.

193
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,064
Okay. Grip and rip.

194
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:24,396
This time it's gonna be
a lot different.

195
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,770
Hey.

196
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,403
- Hey, michelle.
- Hey.

197
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:35,607
- Good to see you.
- You too.

198
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:36,907
- How are you?
- I'm good.

199
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:39,243
- Hey, man.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

200
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:43,354
Just coming to make sure that she
is still kicking your ass at everything.

201
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,456
And i am.

202
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:48,319
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.

203
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,461
All right.

204
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,022
You okay?

205
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:56,759
Yeah, i'm good. You said you were
gonna call me on the 15th.

206
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:58,368
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.

207
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,904
Doctor didn't have the results,
so i had no information to give you.

208
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,973
Still, you should call me.

209
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,770
- Yeah, i know. Yes, i know.
- We're still friends. Right?

210
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,846
Yeah. I'm just...

211
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,507
i'm doing some soul-searching,
you know?

212
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:16,844
Don't do that.

213
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:18,615
- We have a plan.
- I know.

214
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:21,122
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.

215
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,454
You know, they rent clubs
up at the clubhouse.

216
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,392
I'm well aware of that.

217
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:28,829
I think i'm gonna keep my ass
unkicked today.

218
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,846
Were you looking at him,
or were you looking at me?

219
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,882
Actually, i was just sitting here.

220
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,281
Am i doing it wrong?

221
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:59,789
I think i saw you
in the elevator the other day.

222
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:01,926
Oh, yes.

223
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:07,132
Actually, you are being audited.

224
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,333
My name is ben thomas.

225
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:14,632
I'm with the irs,
and you owe the government...

226
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,298
...$56, 240.19.

227
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,240
I know.

228
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:22,846
And now you get me.

229
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,916
Would you have a seat, please,
miss posa?

230
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:31,353
So i've been looking over
the income statements...

231
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:35,015
...from the last three years.

232
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:36,694
- 2005...
- were...?

233
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,792
Were you in my room
the other night?

234
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:46,930
No, ma'am, i was not
in your room the other night.

235
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,903
That's not exactly irs protocol.

236
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,443
So i've been looking over
'05, '06 and '07.

237
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:58,640
There seems to be quite a disparity
between what you claimed and...

238
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:00,113
mr. Thomas?

239
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:05,123
I just got discharged.

240
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,622
So, you know,
unless you're gonna, like...

241
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:09,920
...haul me off
to some irs jail or something...

242
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:13,462
...i'd really like to get home now.

243
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:17,625
- Oh, sure. No problem.
- Okay.

244
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:20,266
I'll be in touch.

245
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:04,079
Welcome to the travel inn.
Can i help you?

246
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:05,614
I need a room.

247
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:07,251
How many hours?

248
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:11,589
About two weeks.

249
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:45,649
Clear it! That's it, that's it!

250
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,716
All right, come on!  vamos,  manny!

251
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:52,295
All right, all right. That's it, that's it.

252
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:54,990
Hey!

253
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:58,133
- What you want?
- Break it up!

254
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:00,669
- You want some of this?
- Get off! Get off!

255
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:03,171
Hey, rico, knock it off!

256
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,639
Somebody wanna remind rico
where we are?

257
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:07,675
The sanctuary, coach!

258
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,713
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!

259
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,612
That's right, rico, in the sanctuary.

260
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,413
Now give me 20 starts and stops.

261
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:18,421
 Hello, this is emily posa. 

262
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:21,718
I'm not home right now, 
but please leave a message... 

263
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:25,624
... and i'll call you back 
as soon as possible. Thank you. 

264
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:28,493
Hi, my name is susan nall. 
I'm calling because a friend... 

265
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:32,137
... told me you do letterpress 
invitations, and i was wondering... 

266
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,932
hello? Hi, this is emily.

267
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:41,106
Yep, i do wedding invitations.

268
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,713
I'm not able to take any requests,
though, right now.

269
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:47,081
I know someone nearby who does it.

270
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:51,222
She's not as good as i am,
but her prices are very...

271
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:54,659
hello?

272
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,224
Duke?

273
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:08,863
Duke.

274
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,803
We're out here.

275
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,515
Hello, miss posa.

276
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:21,876
What are you doing here?

277
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:23,577
Oh, i came to see you.

278
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:26,121
Don't you people ever call ahead?

279
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,194
You people tend to try
to hide things.

280
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,862
Is that meat?

281
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:33,327
No! No, no.

282
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:35,864
No. No meat. No.

283
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:40,402
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.

284
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:43,097
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.

285
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:46,572
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.

286
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:48,940
Well, that sucks.

287
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:52,675
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?

288
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:54,651
No.

289
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,321
Actually, i have to take duke
for a walk.

290
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:02,393
No problem. I'll go with you,
if you don't mind.

291
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:05,759
- So...
- hey, hey.

292
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,454
Hey.

293
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:13,502
So i've been looking over
2005, 2006 and 2007.

294
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:15,367
Now...

295
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,041
i'm listening.

296
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:21,144
- Can i get him for you?
- Nope. I got him.

297
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,281
Let me get him. Let me get him.
Let me get him.

298
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:26,280
- You all right?
- Yes.

299
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:29,318
Whoa, sorry. Whoa, not these.

300
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:33,855
- That's okay. Watch...
- no, no. Heel, heel, heel.

301
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,518
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't
feed him meat.

302
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,721
So i've been looking over...

303
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,664
- yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.

304
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:51,474
So you cook it all
ahead of time, i see.

305
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:54,840
No, actually. I can't remember
the last time i cooked.

306
00:28:55,047 --> 00:29:00,144
This is my sister's way
of looking out for me from afar.

307
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,876
Do you have any siblings?

308
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,954
Yes, one brother.

309
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:07,250
He's a... he's a good egg.

310
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,257
Yeah, i just have the one sister too.

311
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,126
Are you receiving income
from any source...

312
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,597
...that the government
is currently unaware of?

313
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:20,966
Well, lately i've been taking
to diving in local wishing wells, so...

314
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:24,404
i mean, but it's just occasional dimes
here and there...

315
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,339
...or, once in a while, a quarter.

316
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,807
No, actually...

317
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:33,542
...i had to refinance this place
to pay my past-due medical bills.

318
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:39,652
I've been informed that you suffer
from congenital heart failure.

319
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:44,352
Yes. Did you gather that
while stalking me at the hospital?

320
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,798
No, i...

321
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:51,732
you're currently status 2,
which means you're sick enough...

322
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:54,235
...to be on the national unos
waiting list...

323
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:57,374
...but not sick enough to be admitted
into the hospital...

324
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,771
...and placed on status 1.

325
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:04,176
So basically, if your heart starts to fail
quickly and no donor can be located...

326
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:07,584
...you're screwed.

327
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,957
Is it true that you said...

328
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:16,093
...that you do not believe
that you even deserve a heart...

329
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:21,460
...because your life is unremarkable
in every way?

330
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,232
I'm sorry.

331
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:38,749
I don't know why i said that.
I'm sorry.

332
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,114
Do you have to take any type
of sensitivity training...

333
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:43,754
...to join the irs, mr. Thomas?

334
00:30:43,956 --> 00:30:47,289
- No, not really.
- Yeah.

335
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:52,195
So you don't consider yourself
a good person?

336
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:56,692
How would you answer that question
if i asked you the same?

337
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:06,436
"Unremarkable" would be
an upgrade for me...

338
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:08,476
...i assure you.

339
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,481
I'm gonna freeze your accounts
as uncollectible until further notice.

340
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,617
I'm sure that'll buy you
five or six months, penalty-free.

341
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:29,128
Here's my card.

342
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:32,770
If anyone from the irs
tries to contact you...

343
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:35,098
...you call me immediately.

344
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:36,797
Okay.

345
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,537
Thank you.

346
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,010
Thank you.

347
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:45,976
Okay.

348
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,313
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.

349
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:08,202
Why do i get the feeling you're
doing me a really big favor right now?

350
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:15,441
Because i get the feeling
that you really deserve it.

351
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,308
All right?

352
00:32:26,358 --> 00:32:28,189
You off to?

353
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:32,157
You off to pollute
someone else's dog now?

354
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:35,926
No.

355
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:39,728
Just going home.

356
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:42,466
Where's that?

357
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:53,884
Take care, emily.

358
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,778
You too.

359
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:34,443
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.

360
00:34:34,653 --> 00:34:37,053
And why are you bringing a fish
into your room?

361
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:39,314
Because it's my room.

362
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:42,959
And i don't want anyone going
into my room, understood?

363
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:45,561
Well, i don't think you can
keep a fish in your room.

364
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:47,823
I think i can.

365
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:51,469
Well, i've never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

366
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,160
Now you do.

367
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:54,804
Who?

368
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:56,530
Good night.

369
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:16,549
The first time i ever saw 
a box jellyfish... 

370
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,427
... i was 12. 

371
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:30,604
Our father took us 
to the monterey bay aquarium. 

372
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:36,037
I never forgot when he said... 

373
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:41,151
... that it was the most 
deadly creature on earth. 

374
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,881
To me it was just... 

375
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,818
... the most beautiful thing 
i'd ever seen. 

376
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:00,633
I spoke to the doctor again.

377
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:04,070
He's gonna send over your files
in the morning.

378
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:09,176
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.

379
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,782
- Any questions?
- Same one.

380
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:14,417
Well, same answer, then.

381
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,950
You know, i was thinking last night
about when we were 14...

382
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:21,216
...and we made our big pact.

383
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:24,589
You remember on the beach
in front of your grandparents' house...

384
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:30,393
...we agreed that we would never,
never date each other's girls?

385
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,766
I remembered that that night you told
me how much you liked stacy miller...

386
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:38,772
...and that you were gonna
ask her out. And i said:

387
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:43,641
"Hey, man. You can't.
Her and i already did it."

388
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:45,440
Which we didn't, but i wanted to...

389
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:50,519
...but she liked you way more
than she liked me, and...

390
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:52,747
so i lied to you
because i was so jealous.

391
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:57,485
And i realized that i've been
carrying around this lie...

392
00:36:57,696 --> 00:36:59,926
...in my heart for the last 25...

393
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:01,462
stop it!

394
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,929
Stop it.

395
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:08,130
Stay focused.

396
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:10,968
Do what you promised me.

397
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:15,373
- What, you think i'm...?
- Do what you promised me.

398
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:21,148
You think i'm gonna
let you down now, don't you?

399
00:37:21,353 --> 00:37:24,379
I've known you my whole damn life!

400
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:25,681
Okay?

401
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,291
This? This? This is not something
you do every day.

402
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:33,831
Okay? This is...
this is not easy for me.

403
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,033
I'll make sure everything goes
as planned.

404
00:37:44,743 --> 00:37:45,835
Don't worry.

405
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:51,139
Thank you.

406
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:20,401
Oh, my god.

407
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:22,170
Hello, holly.

408
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:24,305
Look at you.

409
00:38:28,253 --> 00:38:31,347
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

410
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,683
- Really?
- You have a minute?

411
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:36,292
Sure. Come on in.

412
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:39,429
Here's my desk. Have a seat.

413
00:38:51,443 --> 00:38:52,432
You look great.

414
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,373
- I do?
- Yes.

415
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,570
I feel great.

416
00:38:56,781 --> 00:39:00,239
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

417
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:02,585
I need a favor.

418
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:06,587
Whatever you need, just ask me.

419
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:10,122
I need a name.
Someone in the system.

420
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:13,354
Someone having
a really hard time...

421
00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:17,194
...that needs help, but may be
too proud to ask for a handout.

422
00:39:21,005 --> 00:39:22,973
What are you doing?

423
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,810
I'm helping.

424
00:39:30,548 --> 00:39:32,379
I need a name.

425
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:37,614
Okay.

426
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,454
Connie tepos. 

427
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:46,028
Her boyfriend almost killed her 
last year when she tried to leave. 

428
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:50,392
He broke three of her ribs 
last month. 

429
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,468
She's scared to death 
to press charges... 

430
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,730
... and we can't do anything. 

431
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,348
- Hello.
- Hi.

432
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:11,784
- Connie tepos?
- Yes?

433
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,118
My name is ben thomas.
I'm with the irs.

434
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:17,487
Irs? But i always pay my taxes.

435
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:21,358
Yes, this is more of
a general inquiry.

436
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:23,932
I don't understand. What...?

437
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,430
May i come in?

438
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:29,607
Not now. My boyfriend is not here.

439
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:32,834
It's very important for your family.

440
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:35,272
For my family?

441
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:49,054
Beautiful.

442
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:53,559
Please, have a seat.

443
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,866
What's this all about?

444
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,071
Your case has come to my attention.

445
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:05,206
And i wanted to get to know you.

446
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:08,345
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?

447
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:11,879
Because i'd like to help you.

448
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:13,876
I don't understand.

449
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,084
I'm aware of your case.

450
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,124
And your boyfriend.

451
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:25,262
What are you talking about?

452
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:30,434
You know what i'm talking about.

453
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:33,263
No, i have no idea
what you're talking about.

454
00:41:35,406 --> 00:41:38,068
Kids, go to your room.

455
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:40,310
He's coming back?

456
00:41:40,512 --> 00:41:43,310
He's not coming back.

457
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,050
You said you were from the irs,
but you're lying to me.

458
00:41:57,262 --> 00:41:58,957
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.

459
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:00,391
Who sent you here?

460
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:02,225
Please sit down.

461
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:03,900
I'm not going to sit down.

462
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:06,866
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.

463
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:08,299
You come into my house.

464
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,304
You talking to me
about  mi caso y mi  boyfriend?

465
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:14,569
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

466
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:17,481
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.

467
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:20,677
You can trust me.

468
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:23,080
I trust no one, mr. Thomas.

469
00:42:23,288 --> 00:42:24,653
I talked to holly.

470
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,456
I can get you out of here.

471
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,563
To a safe place. A beautiful place.

472
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:36,290
Why did you talk to holly?

473
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:37,991
Your children are in danger here.

474
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:39,999
Don't talk about my kids,
mr. Thomas.

475
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:43,173
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.

476
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:45,968
Get out of my house now
or i'm gonna call the police.

477
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:47,804
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?

478
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:50,310
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.

479
00:42:50,515 --> 00:42:52,346
I want you to take my card,
and call me...

480
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,245
- i don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.

481
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,215
Okay. Thank you. Get out right now.

482
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:59,618
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave? This is my house.

483
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,689
Please, just think about it.

484
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:05,863
I don't need you.

485
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:26,840
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately. 

486
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:28,382
- Where are you? 
- I'm nowhere.

487
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,213
I'm gonna meet you at the house.

488
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:34,482
Look, no. I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling. I'll talk to you next week.

489
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:37,718
No, no, no. We need to
discuss this right now.

490
00:44:29,914 --> 00:44:32,781
Wouldn't wanna get
on her bad side.

491
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:35,475
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.

492
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,787
How you doing, you two?

493
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:39,616
I'm good.

494
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:41,787
Got a big day.

495
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:44,860
Yep. No more dialysis, george.
See you in the o.r.

496
00:44:45,063 --> 00:44:46,621
Yep.

497
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,194
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,890
Thank you.

499
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:54,433
So i heard you raised
enough money...

500
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,631
...to give a couple of the kids
partial scholarships to college.

501
00:44:57,842 --> 00:44:59,776
It's no big deal.

502
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,104
I just convinced a couple
of bigwig donors...

503
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:06,044
...that what the world really needs
to see is more latinos on ice.

504
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:13,588
You know, ben,
i keep asking you this...

505
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:16,885
...but why me?

506
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,632
Because you are a good man.

507
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:25,394
No, really.

508
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:31,074
Even when you don't know
that people are watching you.

509
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:44,818
 Hello? 

510
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:47,385
Hello?

511
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,956
Hello?

512
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:56,433
 Okay, i can't hear you, 
 so try back again. 

513
00:45:57,468 --> 00:45:59,436
Gonna hang up now.

514
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:02,134
Bye.

515
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:15,947
Mr. Thomas?

516
00:46:16,154 --> 00:46:18,088
We're ready for you.

517
00:47:45,877 --> 00:47:48,437
These are beautiful.

518
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:51,581
Banana peels. Who knew?

519
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:20,167
Emily?

520
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:58,307
Can i get a refill?

521
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:03,710
- Susan?
- Yeah.

522
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:05,006
How's ryan?

523
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:08,452
He's good. He's at his dad's
this weekend.

524
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:15,080
Will you tell him for me that i'm ready
whenever he is for a free lesson?

525
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:16,384
Yeah, all right.

526
00:50:16,594 --> 00:50:18,858
Things are kind of crazy right now
with school...

527
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:20,860
...but maybe when school's out.

528
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:23,693
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

529
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,419
How's the pie?

530
00:50:51,629 --> 00:50:54,462
Oh, it's... it's good.

531
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:56,690
You gonna ask her out?

532
00:50:57,902 --> 00:50:59,335
The waitress.

533
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:04,340
No.

534
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:06,240
You never know.

535
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:11,904
I don't... i don't think she sees me.

536
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:15,751
Good night, ezra.

537
00:51:54,058 --> 00:51:55,355
Hello?

538
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,785
Ben?

539
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,822
Hi, i'm sorry to call so late.

540
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:08,564
Did...? Did someone
from the irs contact you?

541
00:52:08,772 --> 00:52:10,569
No.

542
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:12,401
I just...

543
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:17,676
i was having trouble breathing after
i took duke for a walk, and i fainted.

544
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:21,247
An ambulance had to take me 
to the hospital. 

545
00:52:23,254 --> 00:52:24,414
I'm so sorry. 

546
00:52:24,622 --> 00:52:26,681
I don't know why i even
called you. I'm sorry.

547
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:30,349
It's just that i have your card
with me, and...

548
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,591
ben?

549
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:40,497
Are you still there?

550
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:42,962
Yes.

551
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:48,841
Do you ever
think about dying, ben?

552
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:52,945
Every now and again.

553
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:57,754
My face is bluish.

554
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:00,924
It's not exactly a good sign.

555
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:03,616
You should try to rest. Just...

556
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:06,557
why don't you see
if you can get some sleep?

557
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:09,626
I like talking to you.

558
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,960
I like talking to you too. 

559
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:17,640
Would you tell me a story, please?

560
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:23,573
Okay.

561
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,442
All right. Once upon a time...

562
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:33,612
... there was a little boy named... 

563
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:38,022
oh, lucky me, you just got it
on reserve like that. Okay.

564
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,323
Let me guess. His name was ben.

565
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:47,695
No, actually,
this little boy's name is tim.

566
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:50,271
I like the name tim.

567
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:52,271
Go on.

568
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,842
Tim's little brother 
was always pestering tim... 

569
00:53:55,045 --> 00:54:00,483
...to make him paper airplanes,
because he was really good at it.

570
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:03,983
But tim had much bigger
dreams than that.

571
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:06,850
Okay. Then what happened?

572
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:09,889
One day, tim went out
to the backyard...

573
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:14,895
...and he put leaves
and taped branches to his arms...

574
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:17,158
...and started climbing
the big oak tree.

575
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:21,065
His little brother said, 
"tim, you can't fly." 

576
00:54:21,272 --> 00:54:23,638
And he said, 
"yeah? You just watch." 

577
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:27,971
He got all the way to the top
and jumped.

578
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:32,782
How tall was this tree?

579
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,217
It was... it was pretty tall. 
He broke his arm. 

580
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,048
Oh, my god...
this is a horrible story.

581
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:40,689
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

582
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:46,523
From that experience,
tim realized that he wanted to fly.

583
00:54:47,197 --> 00:54:50,792
So he dedicated his life
to making spaceships.

584
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:53,629
I thought you said
this was a good story.

585
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:56,835
Oh, well...

586
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,236
yeah, that is...

587
00:55:00,144 --> 00:55:03,511
...until the dragons showed up.

588
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:07,606
Oh, okay, see,
now it's getting better.

589
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:11,083
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.

590
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:15,850
Yes, and these were fire-breathing
space dragons...

591
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,722
... with really bad attitudes. 

592
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,655
I see.

593
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,495
I have an idea.

594
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:27,070
Why don't you try to fall asleep... 

595
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:31,105
... and when you do, 
i'll just hang up. 

596
00:55:33,177 --> 00:55:34,940
Okay.

597
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:37,502
Ben?

598
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:40,082
Yes.

599
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:44,717
Thank you for listening.

600
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:46,822
And for talking.

601
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:51,018
Try to fall asleep. 

602
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,063
Good night, ben.

603
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,032
Good night, emily.

604
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:09,175
Emily?

605
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:17,553
Emily?

606
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:12,498
I lied to you.

607
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:17,506
I think about dying every day.

608
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:31,885
Dr. King to nicu. Dr. Wesley king, 
please report to nicu. 

609
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:15,695
Hey.

610
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,878
- Hey.
- Hey.

611
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:25,948
When did you get here?

612
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:31,384
Last night, after we talked.

613
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:34,548
You slept here?

614
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:39,184
Good morning. How's our patient?

615
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:41,421
- Morning. Better.
- Good.

616
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:44,465
- Hello.
- Hi, ben. Is that right? Irs?

617
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,363
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

618
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,596
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please. Don't go.

619
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,433
He can... he can stay.

620
00:58:51,642 --> 00:58:53,507
Whatever you want.

621
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:57,938
You fainted because
your heart was too weak...

622
00:58:58,148 --> 00:58:59,911
...to pump enough blood
to your brain.

623
00:59:00,117 --> 00:59:03,052
It's enlarged
and it's starting to shut down.

624
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:05,115
How long?

625
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,813
It's entirely up to your heart.

626
00:59:08,025 --> 00:59:11,893
Could be six weeks,
could be a month.

627
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,087
But we've upped you to status 1 b.

628
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,466
At least i'm on the list.

629
00:59:19,002 --> 00:59:23,462
Not only that,
but we're giving you this pager.

630
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:27,371
And when it goes off,
it means you have a donor.

631
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:33,475
The inotrope drug i started you on...

632
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:36,812
...it's gonna stabilize your
blood pressure within 24 hours.

633
00:59:37,955 --> 00:59:39,445
Then what?

634
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:41,647
We wait.

635
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:45,751
- Can i do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.

636
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,954
Okay.

637
00:59:59,476 --> 01:00:04,345
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.

638
01:00:04,548 --> 01:00:07,949
If you want something else,
i can get you something else.

639
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:13,913
Would you stay?

640
01:00:16,827 --> 01:00:19,489
I mean, unless you have
something else to do.

641
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:26,832
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.

642
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:31,397
Okay. Okay.

643
01:00:47,557 --> 01:00:49,787
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?

644
01:00:49,993 --> 01:00:52,018
It's a dog. Just for one night.

645
01:00:52,229 --> 01:00:54,720
No. Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?

646
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:56,455
We have a dog policy here.

647
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:59,261
Little dogs only.
Poodles and shih tzus.

648
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:02,802
It's in the contract. It's english
and spanish for everyone to see.

649
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:05,600
And besides, that, my friend,
is not a dog.

650
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:07,800
It's a goddamn horse.

651
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:11,845
Well, let me know when you add
a horse policy to the contract.

652
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:39,864
Yes.

653
01:01:40,644 --> 01:01:42,771
Mr. Thomas, it's connie tepos.

654
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:45,212
Hey, connie.

655
01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:47,940
I don't know why i'm calling you... 

656
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:50,415
...but i'm calling you.

657
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:53,412
You said you could help us and...

658
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:55,955
can you really help us?

659
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:59,193
This just doesn't make any sense.

660
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:02,094
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.

661
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:03,789
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.

662
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,366
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.

663
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,936
Don't be weak.

664
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:12,768
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.

665
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:17,277
I'm strong.

666
01:02:18,882 --> 01:02:21,874
Take this. Take it.

667
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,152
You are gonna start this car...

668
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:29,225
...and you're gonna go.

669
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:34,459
This is real,
and this is gonna be your new life.

670
01:02:35,499 --> 01:02:38,297
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

671
01:02:38,502 --> 01:02:41,835
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.

672
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:43,835
Look how beautiful
those babies are.

673
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,372
I know, i know.

674
01:02:47,477 --> 01:02:49,308
They deserve it.

675
01:02:51,281 --> 01:02:53,112
Okay?

676
01:02:54,785 --> 01:02:58,221
 You're headed north up the coast. 

677
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,703
Lorena. Lorena.

678
01:03:24,948 --> 01:03:29,180
 I've always believed 
 this place can heal the soul. 

679
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,357
Mommy, the ocean.

680
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:37,288
Yes, the ocean.

681
01:03:37,494 --> 01:03:39,985
I hope that proves true for you. 

682
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:03,513
When you sign your name 
on the dotted line of the contract... 

683
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,280
... you'll own my house outright. 

684
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:11,920
I only ask that you never mention 
how you got the house... 

685
01:04:12,128 --> 01:04:15,757
... or try to contact me 
for any reason. 

686
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:23,970
And if you're wondering why you, 
please stop. 

687
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:34,477
All i ask is for you 
to honor my wishes... 

688
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:41,455
... and, of course, 
live life abundantly. 

689
01:04:53,837 --> 01:04:56,465
Hey. Thanks. Got it.

690
01:04:56,673 --> 01:04:58,470
Hi, duke.

691
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:00,700
Hi, baby.

692
01:05:01,745 --> 01:05:03,940
What time does the nurse come?

693
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:06,980
She should be there
by the time i get home.

694
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,518
- Ben?
- Yes.

695
01:05:14,124 --> 01:05:17,116
I know i'm the girl
with the broken wing.

696
01:05:18,295 --> 01:05:20,593
But who are you?

697
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:22,392
Who am i?

698
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:25,591
I am your friendly neighborhood
tax collector.

699
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:27,292
Ben.

700
01:05:28,772 --> 01:05:31,332
Where the hell did you come from?

701
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:37,170
I grew up in oakland.

702
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:40,645
Literally. Okay.

703
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:44,815
Where did you go to college?

704
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:48,218
As far from oakland as possible.

705
01:05:48,658 --> 01:05:51,684
Massachusetts institute
of technology.

706
01:05:51,895 --> 01:05:53,658
How about you?

707
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:55,831
Ucla.

708
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,432
You went to mit?

709
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:03,000
Like, the mit?

710
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:11,645
Oh, and now you're wondering how
i wound up as a lowly tax collector.

711
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:13,679
Absolutely.

712
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:23,615
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.

713
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:26,088
What from?

714
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:30,095
I always wanted to be an engineer.

715
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:33,092
An engineer?

716
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:36,700
What kind?

717
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:40,370
The kind that sent people
to the moon.

718
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:43,178
Really?

719
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:44,771
Yes.

720
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:48,212
I don't wanna talk
about me anymore.

721
01:06:49,486 --> 01:06:53,650
That's too bad,
because you're very interesting.

722
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:03,626
Have you...?

723
01:07:04,968 --> 01:07:06,959
Have you ever been in love?

724
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:10,362
Emily, please.

725
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:13,132
Yes, you have.

726
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:14,708
Come on, you can tell me.

727
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:21,145
Yes.

728
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:23,816
But it ended.

729
01:07:24,788 --> 01:07:27,552
- What happened?
- Stop it.

730
01:07:28,124 --> 01:07:30,251
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- stop it.

731
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:35,257
You need to get some rest.

732
01:07:35,999 --> 01:07:40,333
I'll call you tomorrow,
or maybe i'll stop by.

733
01:07:43,173 --> 01:07:46,540
No, if i have questions tomorrow,
what then?

734
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,642
That's not a part of the deal.

735
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:54,307
What the hell does that mean?

736
01:08:15,038 --> 01:08:18,132
Emily, hold on. Hold on.

737
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:21,367
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.

738
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:23,011
Wait!

739
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:36,089
Thank you for everything you did.

740
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:11,119
Did you like the eggs?

741
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:13,295
They were okay, i guess.

742
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:15,794
I don't like the eggs you buy.

743
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:18,960
Okay.

744
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:49,228
You're wearing suit pants.

745
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,758
To weed.

746
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:56,029
Yeah, i didn't... i didn't have
any other clothes with me.

747
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:59,574
- You know, i was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.

748
01:09:59,776 --> 01:10:04,372
I figured i would just take the day off
and get this done for you.

749
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,781
Ben?

750
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:10,247
Yeah?

751
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:13,286
This is a really ridiculous apology.

752
01:10:19,229 --> 01:10:22,824
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

753
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:24,897
Oh, no, i gotta finish.

754
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:28,894
You can finish tomorrow.

755
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,067
Come on.

756
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:48,581
This is where i used to work.

757
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:52,860
And these are the artifacts
of said work.

758
01:10:53,463 --> 01:10:56,125
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?

759
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:03,170
This one is just shy of 120 years.

760
01:11:03,706 --> 01:11:09,042
It's how i put out my line of letterpress
cards, wedding invitations, invites.

761
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:11,008
What about this one?

762
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:13,412
That youngster...

763
01:11:13,616 --> 01:11:18,383
...is the heidelberg windmill, 1956.

764
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:20,786
Call it "the beast."

765
01:11:21,491 --> 01:11:23,857
Well, that seems appropriate.

766
01:11:24,327 --> 01:11:26,852
It pooped out on me
about five years ago, though.

767
01:11:27,063 --> 01:11:29,657
And i can't find anybody to fix it.

768
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:32,300
It's kind of a dying art.

769
01:11:32,502 --> 01:11:35,062
Defibrillator here works, though.

770
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:37,671
Luckily. It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?

771
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:39,535
Please.

772
01:11:40,143 --> 01:11:43,476
Okay. Now, true pressmen...

773
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,047
...hate that we modern girls...

774
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:49,982
...want a deep impression.

775
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:54,646
See, for a hundred years, they tried
their damnedest just to kiss it...

776
01:11:55,058 --> 01:11:58,255
...so that it didn't leave
an indentation.

777
01:11:59,262 --> 01:12:02,698
Now it's the only way
to prove it's not digital.

778
01:12:07,637 --> 01:12:10,071
I think it feels richer.

779
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:14,171
You okay?

780
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,306
Yeah.

781
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:19,738
Look, ben...

782
01:12:21,184 --> 01:12:26,884
i don't really know anything about you
or where you came from...

783
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,418
...but you keep showing up.

784
01:12:33,663 --> 01:12:35,426
And i'm glad.

785
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,827
Okay.

786
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:42,470
Okay.

787
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:45,937
So duke needs a walk.

788
01:12:46,142 --> 01:12:47,837
Are you interested?

789
01:12:48,544 --> 01:12:50,239
Yes.

790
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:03,583
Come on.

791
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:07,226
Hey, hey.

792
01:13:08,264 --> 01:13:09,891
Right here.

793
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:11,828
There you go.

794
01:13:12,435 --> 01:13:15,404
He's like a different dog
with you around.

795
01:13:15,972 --> 01:13:18,736
I don't think we ever
properly bonded.

796
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:22,439
Why would you get such a big dog?

797
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:32,518
Did you know that great danes on
average only live about seven years?

798
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:36,558
They have heart issues.

799
01:13:39,162 --> 01:13:41,494
I think i got him because...

800
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,691
...i thought he could help me
with my illness.

801
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:47,502
It'd be something
i could take care of...

802
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:50,365
...as opposed to being
always taken care of.

803
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:58,144
You know, just so you know,
i used to be really hot.

804
01:14:00,116 --> 01:14:02,983
Like, unauditably hot.

805
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:05,520
Is that so?

806
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:07,211
Yeah.

807
01:14:14,297 --> 01:14:17,323
I haven't felt like this
in a really long time.

808
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,770
There's so many things
that i wanna do.

809
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:34,983
I wanna go on a plane
for 13 hours...

810
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:38,711
...and not have to stress
that i can't reach my doctor.

811
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:45,189
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.

812
01:14:45,995 --> 01:14:48,088
See the world.

813
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:54,569
I just wanna have the time
to figure out who it is that i am.

814
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,965
You know, what i like.

815
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:02,838
Do things, try things,
get out of my head for once.

816
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,647
I would really like to go running.

817
01:15:12,522 --> 01:15:13,819
I think about that sometimes.

818
01:15:14,023 --> 01:15:18,289
What it would just feel like
to go running.

819
01:15:53,162 --> 01:15:54,857
So...

820
01:15:55,932 --> 01:15:57,456
...see you tomorrow?

821
01:15:58,935 --> 01:16:00,493
Yes.

822
01:16:01,671 --> 01:16:06,608
But if you need anything,
just call and i'll come right back.

823
01:16:07,777 --> 01:16:09,335
Okay.

824
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:18,109
Bye.

825
01:16:29,599 --> 01:16:31,464
I had a really great time today.

826
01:16:31,968 --> 01:16:33,731
Me too.

827
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:36,831
Bye.

828
01:20:47,156 --> 01:20:50,148
No anesthetic. You ever
donated bone marrow before?

829
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:52,224
You're a brave guy.

830
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:57,329
How long have you
known nicholas?

831
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:09,133
What the hell happened to you?

832
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:14,138
Hey, how much longer
are you gonna stay in my hotel?

833
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:15,544
Motel.

834
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:17,616
How much longer?

835
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:21,556
Actually, i was planning
on dying here.

836
01:21:22,024 --> 01:21:24,686
Well, then you need to pay
in advance.

837
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:17,670
Hello?

838
01:22:19,748 --> 01:22:21,306
Hey, it's emily.

839
01:22:21,517 --> 01:22:23,041
Are you sleeping?

840
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:28,047
Yes. No.

841
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:30,724
Is everything okay?

842
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:33,852
Yeah, i'm fine.

843
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:38,123
My sister came over for a couple
of days last week with the kids...

844
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:40,802
...and it was really great.

845
01:22:42,137 --> 01:22:44,867
I tried calling you a couple times. 

846
01:22:45,074 --> 01:22:46,598
How are you doing? 

847
01:22:46,809 --> 01:22:48,606
Yeah, i'm good.

848
01:22:48,811 --> 01:22:51,780
Everything's fine. I've been...

849
01:22:52,348 --> 01:22:56,182
i've been traveling a lot, so...

850
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:01,088
well, are you busy tonight?

851
01:23:02,891 --> 01:23:04,188
What do you mean?

852
01:23:04,994 --> 01:23:08,987
I don't... maybe you wanna
come by and say hello?

853
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,029
Around 7?

854
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:15,729
You don't have to if you don't want to. 
I just, you know... 

855
01:23:19,842 --> 01:23:23,835
look, i totally get if you don't wanna
hang out with the dying girl, so...

856
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,308
i can... i can come at 7.

857
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:31,785
Okay.

858
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,355
Okay.

859
01:23:35,858 --> 01:23:37,416
Bye.

860
01:24:21,804 --> 01:24:25,331
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.

861
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:28,066
- How you doing?
- Have fun.

862
01:24:28,911 --> 01:24:30,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

863
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,907
Come in.

864
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:35,379
I am so glad she's gone.

865
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:37,279
Are you okay if we eat outside?

866
01:24:37,686 --> 01:24:38,744
Eating?

867
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:40,387
You didn't eat already, did you?

868
01:24:40,589 --> 01:24:42,750
- No.
- Okay.

869
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,984
No.

870
01:24:46,195 --> 01:24:49,392
Well, it was a surprise...

871
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:51,896
...but you're on time.

872
01:24:54,103 --> 01:24:59,439
I haven't cooked anybody food
for years, so you better like it.

873
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:01,575
Or lie to me.

874
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,038
This is for you.

875
01:25:07,349 --> 01:25:11,752
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it... change in there.

876
01:25:11,954 --> 01:25:15,481
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.

877
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:18,254
Chop-chop.

878
01:26:19,087 --> 01:26:20,782
You look great.

879
01:26:21,623 --> 01:26:23,887
Yeah. It's pink.

880
01:26:24,293 --> 01:26:26,090
It's salmon.

881
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:41,032
You are so nice.

882
01:26:42,878 --> 01:26:44,539
So are you.

883
01:26:52,554 --> 01:26:54,886
Everything's vegetarian.

884
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,553
I hope you like eggplant parmesan.

885
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:05,661
I haven't treated myself very well...

886
01:27:05,867 --> 01:27:08,335
...in the past few years.

887
01:27:10,672 --> 01:27:12,401
Start now.

888
01:27:20,249 --> 01:27:21,841
All right.

889
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,925
What do you think?

890
01:27:35,564 --> 01:27:37,589
It's delicious.

891
01:27:40,202 --> 01:27:41,999
Glad you like it.

892
01:28:22,277 --> 01:28:24,472
Do you wanna hear
my favorite song?

893
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,912
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

894
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:34,313
No, i can't sing anymore.

895
01:28:35,324 --> 01:28:36,985
Oh, and a performance.

896
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:39,057
Oh, no.

897
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:24,300
Shall we?

898
01:29:43,558 --> 01:29:45,253
You need to relax.

899
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:48,456
This is relaxed.

900
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:22,695
I have a surprise for you.

901
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,597
Surprise?

902
01:30:27,402 --> 01:30:28,926
Yes.

903
01:30:29,704 --> 01:30:31,171
For me?

904
01:30:34,376 --> 01:30:36,742
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

905
01:30:43,685 --> 01:30:46,449
And open.

906
01:30:51,193 --> 01:30:52,592
Okay.

907
01:31:00,202 --> 01:31:02,227
You cleaned the beast.

908
01:31:03,538 --> 01:31:05,972
Actually, i fixed it.

909
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:08,604
No, you didn't.

910
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:10,539
Oh, okay, let's go, then.

911
01:31:10,745 --> 01:31:13,714
Wait. Are you serious?

912
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:15,439
Try it.

913
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:25,517
Okay.

914
01:32:09,204 --> 01:32:10,899
Thank you.

915
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:54,114
Wait right here, okay?

916
01:32:54,482 --> 01:32:56,973
I'll be right back. Wait right here.

917
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:01,587
One second.

918
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:14,934
Hey!

919
01:33:16,037 --> 01:33:17,834
Tell me what's going on.

920
01:33:18,373 --> 01:33:19,670
- Now!
- All right.

921
01:33:19,874 --> 01:33:22,001
Ben, you need to go home.

922
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:26,146
Do you know they keep a full history of
every inquiry a revenue officer makes?

923
01:33:26,348 --> 01:33:28,077
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.

924
01:33:28,283 --> 01:33:31,411
- Just keep your voice down.
- No. What you are doing is a crime!

925
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:34,111
You are impersonating
a federal officer. It's a felony!

926
01:33:34,322 --> 01:33:35,516
All right. Listen.

927
01:33:35,724 --> 01:33:39,160
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?

928
01:33:39,361 --> 01:33:42,524
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.

929
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:44,756
There's a coffee shop
near where i'm staying.

930
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:47,526
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- where are you staying, tim?

931
01:33:47,736 --> 01:33:50,261
Tell me, because i don't know
where my brother lives!

932
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:53,131
A motel. Five blocks from here.

933
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:55,605
We'll sit down tomorrow morning,
i guarantee it.

934
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:58,540
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.

935
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:07,711
Here it is. Here. Here.

936
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:11,015
Just go home.

937
01:34:11,226 --> 01:34:14,354
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.

938
01:34:14,562 --> 01:34:16,792
Tim, tim, tim,
why are you even here?

939
01:34:16,998 --> 01:34:19,660
Tell me, who is emily posa?

940
01:34:22,404 --> 01:34:24,429
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

941
01:34:30,078 --> 01:34:32,171
Look, give me your car keys.

942
01:34:39,354 --> 01:34:41,447
I'm not going anywhere.

943
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:44,158
I'm gonna be right here.

944
01:34:45,593 --> 01:34:49,586
So you remember i love you and...

945
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,429
tim, don't make me come knock
on the door, okay?

946
01:35:20,295 --> 01:35:24,493
I didn't realize how late it was and...

947
01:35:27,268 --> 01:35:31,136
i have a really long drive,
so i need to go.

948
01:35:34,843 --> 01:35:36,811
I don't wanna keep lying to you.

949
01:35:38,046 --> 01:35:41,243
I don't wanna... wait, emily.

950
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:43,864
Do you wanna play a game?

951
01:37:45,573 --> 01:37:47,200
What game?

952
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:52,145
The "what if" game.

953
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:56,377
The "what if" game.

954
01:37:57,852 --> 01:37:59,717
What if...

955
01:38:01,256 --> 01:38:03,383
...my pager goes off...

956
01:38:06,327 --> 01:38:08,352
...and it's a heart...

957
01:38:09,497 --> 01:38:11,465
...and...

958
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,197
...it works?

959
01:38:15,837 --> 01:38:18,533
And my body doesn't reject it?

960
01:38:20,842 --> 01:38:22,707
And...

961
01:38:27,215 --> 01:38:29,513
...what if i have time?

962
01:38:42,997 --> 01:38:44,794
What if?

963
01:38:49,837 --> 01:38:52,362
What if we have children?

964
01:38:57,912 --> 01:39:00,244
What if we got married?

965
01:39:14,195 --> 01:39:15,856
I love you.

966
01:39:16,064 --> 01:39:18,430
- I love you too.
- I love you.

967
01:41:14,215 --> 01:41:15,773
Hi.

968
01:41:16,284 --> 01:41:19,117
Is dr. Briar on duty tonight?

969
01:41:19,921 --> 01:41:21,445
She's doing her rounds.

970
01:41:21,656 --> 01:41:24,420
Can you tell her it's ben thomas?

971
01:41:25,126 --> 01:41:26,115
It's very important.

972
01:41:26,694 --> 01:41:29,595
- I'il... i'll page her.
- Thank you.

973
01:41:31,699 --> 01:41:34,634
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.

974
01:42:00,228 --> 01:42:01,718
Hey.

975
01:42:02,663 --> 01:42:05,757
- Is it emily?
- No, no.

976
01:42:07,335 --> 01:42:08,996
I'm sorry.

977
01:42:10,905 --> 01:42:12,304
It's...

978
01:42:12,673 --> 01:42:14,368
is there?

979
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:18,167
I'm sorry.

980
01:42:18,713 --> 01:42:22,911
Do you have any more optimism...

981
01:42:23,117 --> 01:42:25,677
...about emily...

982
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:28,618
...than you did the other day?

983
01:42:29,323 --> 01:42:30,722
Ben...

984
01:42:31,759 --> 01:42:36,719
...when you're looking for a donor
with a rare blood type...

985
01:42:38,099 --> 01:42:39,691
...the odds go way down.

986
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:41,824
To what?

987
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:44,829
They go down. What's the...?

988
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:47,030
Give me a percentage.

989
01:42:48,309 --> 01:42:50,004
Give me a number.

990
01:42:51,012 --> 01:42:53,242
Three, 5 percent.

991
01:42:54,348 --> 01:42:56,873
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.

992
01:42:57,084 --> 01:42:59,484
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I do.

993
01:43:45,533 --> 01:43:46,693
Hello?

994
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:48,925
Dan.

995
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:51,565
It's time.

996
01:43:52,273 --> 01:43:53,831
I love you.

997
01:44:50,564 --> 01:44:53,328
 1:38 a.m. 

998
01:44:56,404 --> 01:44:57,632
Hello?

999
01:44:57,838 --> 01:44:59,669
Ezra.

1000
01:45:02,109 --> 01:45:04,407
My name is ben thomas.

1001
01:45:06,147 --> 01:45:09,139
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.

1002
01:45:10,584 --> 01:45:13,519
I do remember.

1003
01:45:13,721 --> 01:45:16,690
 I wanna apologize for being 
 so cruel to you... 

1004
01:45:17,224 --> 01:45:19,249
...but i had to be certain.

1005
01:45:20,261 --> 01:45:23,697
I had to be certain
that you were a decent man. Kind.

1006
01:45:23,898 --> 01:45:27,390
 - Slow to anger. 
- What do you want from me?

1007
01:45:28,402 --> 01:45:30,597
I wanna give you a gift.

1008
01:45:31,706 --> 01:45:35,403
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named dan morris.

1009
01:45:36,444 --> 01:45:38,537
 You can trust him. 

1010
01:45:38,746 --> 01:45:41,044
Was that you at the diner?

1011
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:44,076
Goodbye.

1012
01:46:06,607 --> 01:46:08,700
 911 emergency. 

1013
01:46:13,147 --> 01:46:14,910
I need an ambulance.

1014
01:46:15,116 --> 01:46:19,678
 I have you at 9212 west third street 
 in los angeles. 

1015
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:24,881
Yes, room number 2.

1016
01:46:25,626 --> 01:46:27,753
 What's the emergency? 

1017
01:46:30,197 --> 01:46:32,392
There's been a suicide.

1018
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,397
 Who's the victim? 

1019
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:37,735
I am.

1020
01:46:39,673 --> 01:46:42,335
You are gonna need to stop
looking at that thing so much.

1021
01:46:42,543 --> 01:46:45,205
Why? Is it gonna crack?

1022
01:46:45,413 --> 01:46:48,007
Oh, no. I paid extra
for the non-cracking kind.

1023
01:46:48,215 --> 01:46:49,910
I bet you did.

1024
01:46:50,684 --> 01:46:53,710
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know. No more. No more work.

1025
01:46:53,921 --> 01:46:55,548
I'm done. Almost done. Almost done.

1026
01:46:55,756 --> 01:46:57,280
Tim!

1027
01:49:52,633 --> 01:49:53,657
I have procedures.

1028
01:49:53,867 --> 01:49:57,325
I understand, but she needs
that heart or she will die.

1029
01:50:18,559 --> 01:50:21,255
- Ben?
- One, two, three.

1030
01:50:33,874 --> 01:50:35,535
Hey.

1031
01:50:35,943 --> 01:50:38,002
How you doing?

1032
01:52:45,305 --> 01:52:48,502
About a year after the accident,
i got sick.

1033
01:52:49,977 --> 01:52:54,243
I got lung cancer,
and i needed a double-iobe transplant.

1034
01:52:55,849 --> 01:52:58,613
Tim could only give me one,
of course.

1035
01:52:59,419 --> 01:53:02,286
It must have planted a seed,
because he...

1036
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:05,920
about six months later...

1037
01:53:07,861 --> 01:53:11,319
...he donated the right part of his
liver to this woman.

1038
01:53:14,635 --> 01:53:17,729
Her name is holly.

1039
01:55:58,632 --> 01:56:01,624
I'm proud of you kids. Very proud.

1040
01:56:01,835 --> 01:56:04,531
Good job. Good job.

1041
01:56:04,738 --> 01:56:06,706
- Ezra.
- Yeah.

1042
01:56:06,907 --> 01:56:08,306
Hi.

1043
01:56:10,143 --> 01:56:12,976
Are you a parent?

1044
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:14,477
No.

1045
01:56:16,316 --> 01:56:18,216
Have we met?

1046
01:56:23,623 --> 01:56:25,215
You okay?

1047
01:56:39,072 --> 01:56:40,835
You must be emily.

1048
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,538
Yes.

1049
01:56:51,752 --> 01:56:54,277
It's so nice to meet you.
