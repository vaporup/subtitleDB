1
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,570
I am Nameless,
Prefect of Leng Meng County

2
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,380
Please allow me
to fight this assassin

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,520
She is on His Majesty's
most wanted list

4
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,550
Now that she's here,
I will arrest her

5
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,880
The assassin and I have agreed

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,790
To fight one on one

7
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,000
Should I be unable to defeat her,

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,490
Please apprehend her

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,360
I seek your permission

10
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,510
Draw your sword!

11
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,540
Hail! Hail! Hail!

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,640
Make your move!

13
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,140
Hail! Hail! Hail!

14
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,680
I die willingly

15
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,840
Make your move

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,060
Hail! Hail! Hail!

17
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:32,200
Hail! Hail! Hail!

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,370
Hail! Hail! Hail!

19
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,540
Hail! Hail! Hail!

20
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,610
How swift thy sword!

21
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,840
I believe you and
Broken Sword also fought

22
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,910
And like your fight with Sky

23
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,410
It was not real

24
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,310
But rather it was

25
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,790
A battle in your minds

26
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,050
A fight to honor Flying Snow.

27
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,340
My master wishes you
to have his sword

28
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Why?

29
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,390
Broken Sword and Flying Snow
are bound in life and death

30
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,330
They will never part,
nor will their swords

31
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,200
It is his dying wish

32
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,040
That you take his sword
for your mission

33
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,310
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

34
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,950
Sacrificed themselves

35
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,580
So you could be
within ten paces of me

36
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,340
All three gave you their lives

37
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,620
The best of friends
could not give more

38
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,520
Therefore you are

39
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,180
The most dangerous assassin of all

40
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,030
How did you uncover my plan?

41
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,240
The flames of these candles

42
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,610
Are disturbed by your murderous intent

43
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,080
All of you

44
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,560
Are willing to die for a cause

45
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,790
I am ashamed to say
I'm not that committed

46
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,020
Your Majesty has seen through our plan

47
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
If I had realized this sooner

48
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,300
I wouldn't have allowed you so close

49
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,880
A citizen of Qin would not do this

50
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,240
Who are you?

51
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,070
A man of Zhao

52
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,910
Your Qin soldiers killed my family

53
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,480
I wandered into Qin

54
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,180
And was adopted

55
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,050
I discovered my real identity
ten years ago

56
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,320
And set my heart on this plan

57
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,620
You've come to avenge Zhao

58
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,260
I see

59
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,730
I would like to know

60
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,270
If your special skill has a name

61
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,900
As Your Majesty guessed

62
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,740
There is only one crucial move

63
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,030
What is that?

64
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,980
"Death within Ten Paces."

65
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,370
"Death within Ten Paces."
A good name!

66
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,210
All my guards
are one hundred paces away

67
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,650
Outside the palace

68
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,010
You are within ten paces

69
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,080
It would seem

70
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,180
That today I am doomed

71
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,530
But I sense your hesitation

72
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,600
Your Majesty is perceptive

73
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,370
However

74
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,740
You too have underestimated someone.

75
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,670
Who?

76
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,250
Broken Sword

77
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,160
I needed to prove to them

78
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,690
That my sword was fast and accurate

79
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,200
Within ten paces

80
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,310
My sword strikes
with surgical precision

81
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,940
If it enters
at precise pressure points

82
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,170
It will not cause any fatal injury

83
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,550
If one of you would take a blow

84
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,350
Before witnesses,
we can fool the King

85
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,390
Such a blow is hardly child's play

86
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,480
How is Sky now?

87
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,120
Fully recovered

88
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,730
His trust in your sword
was extraordinary

89
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,260
The King's security is impenetrable

90
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,200
There was no other way

91
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
His Imperial Guards were useless

92
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,940
He should have died three years ago.

93
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,200
What went wrong?

94
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,510
I abandoned the plan

95
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,290
The King must not be killed

96
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,190
He said that?

97
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,090
Yes

98
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,180
Why?

99
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,760
I also asked him

100
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,150
What did he say?

101
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,390
He would not explain that day

102
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,370
Broken Sword is the strongest
of the three

103
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,870
He and I are probably equal in skills

104
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,200
What he told me later

105
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,940
Greatly unsettled me

106
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,480
While I'm alive

107
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,480
I will stop you
from assassinating the King

108
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,150
I will help you

109
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,760
He let the opportunity go by

110
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,100
This time, we must succeed

111
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,660
I'll see you tomorrow
at the Qin camp

112
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,840
Please do me a favor

113
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,780
Help me fight Broken Sword!

114
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,530
Master!

115
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,030
What are you waiting for?

116
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,130
Although I had agreed to help her

117
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,230
Attack from behind is dishonorable

118
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,070
So I couldn't draw my sword

119
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,710
But we both knew

120
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,640
If we did not stop Broken Sword

121
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,240
We would never succeed

122
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,550
Moon, don't!

123
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,820
You're no match for him. Stop

124
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,750
I knew this would happen

125
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,490
You can't stop me now

126
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,560
Even wounded, I would still stop you

127
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,970
Then I will kill you!

128
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,100
Did I hurt him too much?

129
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,370
Your special medicine

130
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,370
Should heal his wounds in a day

131
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,540
Have you delivered it?

132
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,580
I tended to the wound myself

133
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,120
After the battle, take my sword

134
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,780
And follow Nameless to see the King

135
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Yes

136
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,620
They won't treat a servant harshly

137
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,420
If the assassination succeeds

138
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,790
Wave a red flag on your return

139
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,770
If it fails, a yellow one

140
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,990
If something happens to you
my message will be useless

141
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,840
I will smile from Heaven

142
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,110
If I see a red flag

143
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,260
How is Flying Snow?

144
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,860
She is resting

145
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,940
She doesn't know I've come

146
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,940
You said you would stop me

147
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,980
Please abandon the mission

148
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,670
You know I'm a man of Zhao

149
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,040
So am I

150
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,940
Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao?

151
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,350
Yes

152
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,380
Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao?

153
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Yes

154
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,850
Who are you trying to defend?

155
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,550
You call yourself a man of Zhao?

156
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,760
Flying Snow has asked me that too

157
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,600
When we first met

158
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,330
I was living a carefree life

159
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,200
She is the daughter of a Zhao general

160
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,910
Who died in battle against Qin

161
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,980
She inherited his sword

162
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,680
She wanted to avenge her father

163
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,680
I promised to help her

164
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,080
Calligraphy and swordplay

165
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,690
Share the same principles

166
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,260
We did calligraphy to
inspire our swordplay

167
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,520
And to heighten our powers

168
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,800
She knew I'd drifted since childhood

169
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Calling no place home

170
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,400
Once we had killed the King,

171
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,640
She said she would
take me to her home

172
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,640
We would be swordsmen no more

173
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,330
Only a man

174
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,540
And a woman

175
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
The essence of calligraphy
is from the soul

176
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,640
Swordsmanship is the same

177
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,570
Both aspire to truth and simplicity

178
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,210
Gradually I recognized a greater cause

179
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,280
Three years ago
we perfected our skills

180
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,580
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead

181
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,550
Together, we stormed the palace

182
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,070
She asked why I had
abandoned the mission

183
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,170
I told her the King must not be killed

184
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,510
That is what calligraphy taught me

185
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,210
I didn't kill the King

186
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,750
After that she refused to talk to me

187
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,490
Please abandon your plan

188
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,890
No

189
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,230
Was your sword forged in hatred?

190
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,620
Yes

191
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,960
For ten years,
that hatred has never died

192
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,700
I can't stop now

193
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,500
How can I dissuade you?

194
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,270
Only by killing me

195
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,170
Are you that determined?

196
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Yes

197
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,940
Allow me to convey my conviction

198
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,880
In three words

199
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,720
These words express my heart

200
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,180
Please consider

201
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,490
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless

202
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,770
Flying Snow and I will never part

203
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,340
Neither will our swords

204
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,410
Master Nameless

205
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,620
Though I am just a humble servant

206
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,060
Allow me to say a few words

207
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,190
I have been with my master
since I was eight

208
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,360
He taught me martial arts

209
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,400
And how to be a decent person

210
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,770
Whatever my master does

211
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,500
Is for a good reason

212
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,510
The words he has given you

213
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,010
Carry a deep meaning

214
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,350
Master Nameless,
please take his advice

215
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,920
What were the words he wrote?

216
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,570
"All under Heaven."

217
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,600
All under Heaven...

218
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,000
Broken Sword said

219
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,640
"The people have suffered
years of warfare"

220
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,240
"Only the King of Qin
can stop the chaos"

221
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,550
"By uniting all under Heaven."

222
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,980
He asked me
to abandon the assassination

223
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,510
For the greater good of all

224
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,580
He said,
"One person's suffering is nothing"

225
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,060
"Compared to the suffering of many"

226
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,890
"The rivalry
of Qin and Zhao is trivial"

227
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,820
"Compared to the greater cause"

228
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,360
The person who really understands me

229
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,170
Is my most feared enemy

230
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,410
Alone, I have endured so much criticism

231
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,310
So many attempts on my life

232
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,920
No one understands my intentions

233
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,490
Even my court officials

234
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,200
See me as a tyrant

235
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,800
But I never imagined

236
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,130
That Broken Sword, my arch-enemy

237
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,770
Would truly understand

238
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,200
And appreciate my real motives

239
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,610
I would like to know

240
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,360
How you mean to kill me
without your sword?

241
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,160
By capturing yours!

242
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,970
This sword has protected me

243
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,580
Through all my battles

244
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,610
Having found a true confidant
in Broken Sword

245
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,620
If I die, I am content with my life

246
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,050
Let "All under Heaven"

247
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,580
Guide your decision

248
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,640
It just dawned on me!

249
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,570
This scroll of Broken Sword's

250
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,770
Isn't about sword technique

251
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,350
But about swordsmanship's
ultimate ideal

252
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,910
Swordsmanship's first achievement

253
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,550
Is the unity of man and sword

254
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,750
Once this unity is attained

255
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,190
Even a blade of grass can be a weapon

256
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,060
The second achievement is when

257
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,000
The sword exists in one's heart

258
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,730
When absent from one's hand
One can strike an enemy
at a hundred paces

259
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,960
Even with bare hands

260
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,670
Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement

261
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Is the absence of the sword
in both hand and heart

262
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,740
The swordsman is at peace

263
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,140
With the rest of the world

264
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,410
He vows not to kill

265
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,850
And to bring peace to mankind

266
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,550
Your Majesty,
your visions have convinced me

267
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,020
That you are committed
to the highest ideal

268
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,480
Of ultimate swordsmanship

269
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,020
Therefore I cannot kill you

270
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,970
Remember those who gave their lives

271
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,100
For the highest ideal:
peace with no more killing

272
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,960
Nameless went to within ten paces
of the King

273
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,360
He could not have failed

274
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,030
There is only one explanation

275
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,030
He must have abandoned the mission

276
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,510
What did you say to him?

277
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,510
I wrote three words

278
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,370
What words?

279
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,610
"All under Heaven."

280
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,270
That is all you care about!

281
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,490
And you

282
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,520
I don't believe you

283
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,090
How can I convince you?

284
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,770
Draw your sword

285
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,530
You've misled Nameless

286
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,560
You've ruined Sky
and the Kingdom of Zhao

287
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
Draw!

288
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,680
When we first met...

289
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,080
I had to prove myself to convince you

290
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,750
What can I do this time?

291
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,820
Just draw your sword!

292
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,000
Why didn't you fend off my sword?

293
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,880
So that you'd believe me

294
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,110
I always wanted to go home with you

295
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,160
Sadly, it won't happen now

296
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,890
Take good care of yourself

297
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,580
Why didn't you defend yourself?

298
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,130
Why didn't you defend yourself?

299
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,810
Why didn't you?

300
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,210
No more drifting, no more roaming

301
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,780
I'm taking you home now

302
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,860
Our home

303
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,090
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

304
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,360
Permission to execute?

305
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,740
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

306
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,270
Permission to execute?

307
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,090
He conspired
to assassinate Your Majesty

308
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,600
Show no mercy!

309
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:00,360
This is the law of Qin!

310
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,070
To conquer all under Heaven

311
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,370
The law must be enforced

312
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,140
Set an example for the world!

313
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,710
Execute him! Execute him!

314
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,280
Execute him!

315
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,990
Execute him! Execute him!

316
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,680
Execute him!

317
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,290
Execute him!

318
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,550
Hail! Hail! Hail!

319
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,800
Hail! Hail! Hail!

320
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,370
Nameless was executed an assassin
but buried a hero...

321
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,130
Sky gave up his sword
in honor of his fallen friends...

322
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,490
In 221 B.C., the King of Qin
conquered all six kingdoms
and unified China.

323
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,270
He ceased all expeditions
and built the Great Wall
to protect his subjects
from the Northern Tribes.

324
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,590
The Qin Empire became the first
dynasty of China...

325
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,590
And Qin Shihuang...
the First Emperor.
