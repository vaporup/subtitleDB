1
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,740
Two thousand years ago...
during the Warring States period,
China was divided into seven Kingdoms.

2
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,940
For years they battled for supremacy
while the people suffered.

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,540
The King of Qin was the most ruthless
in his efforts to conquer the land
and unify all under heaven.

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,840
He was regarded as a common threat
by the other six Kingdoms.

5
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,040
The annals of Chinese history
abound with tales of the assassins
sent to kill the great King.

6
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,340
This is one of the legends...

7
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,700
I was orphaned at an early age

8
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,570
I had no name,
so people called me Nameless

9
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,900
Being a nobody,
I studied swordsmanship

10
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,210
After ten years of practice

11
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,350
I acquired a unique skill

12
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,180
The King of Qin has summoned me

13
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,980
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom

14
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,290
By order of His Majesty

15
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,590
We have brought the mighty warrior

16
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,210
Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword

17
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,180
The three assassins from Zhao

18
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,980
Have sought His Majesty's life
for ten years

19
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,460
His Majesty has known no peace

20
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,320
To the astonishment of all

21
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,260
A mighty warrior of Qin
has smashed them

22
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,540
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!

23
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,470
We rejoice for our King!

24
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,270
This warrior sent from Heaven

25
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,480
Has exterminated the assassins

26
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,020
Summon the warrior!

27
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,130
Remain one hundred paces
from His Majesty

28
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,860
Or you will be executed.
Never forget that

29
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,830
No one is allowed within
one hundred paces of me

30
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,170
Do you know why?

31
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
To guard against assassins

32
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,810
Yes. That is why I am confined
in this armor

33
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,950
You have removed a great peril for me

34
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,320
How should I reward you?

35
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,050
My service was for Qin,
not for a reward

36
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
Achievements must be rewarded

37
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,490
Sky's silver spear...

38
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,800
Wounded many of my brave warriors

39
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,530
Announce my edict!

40
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,940
By order of His Majesty,

41
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,450
He who kills Sky
will receive gold and land

42
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,950
And be allowed to drink

43
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,610
Within twenty paces of His Majesty

44
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,370
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin

45
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,040
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County

46
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,240
A County Prefect over ten square miles!

47
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,610
Surely the lowest-ranking
official in Qin

48
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,010
How did you defeat such opponents?

49
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,580
I took them on one by one

50
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,750
Tell me the details

51
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,280
Does Your Majesty know

52
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,790
Flying Snow and Broken Sword
were lovers?

53
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,500
Yes, I do

54
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,600
And that they hadn't spoken
for three years?

55
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,300
For three years? Why?

56
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,440
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky

57
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,240
Broken Sword never forgave her

58
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,940
Why haven't I heard this before?

59
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,610
I went to great lengths to uncover it

60
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,270
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword

61
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,210
I first needed to eliminate Sky

62
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,480
I have an idea of what you planned

63
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,150
Your Majesty is wise

64
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,750
What did you use to defeat Sky?

65
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,120
The sword

66
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,290
I must arrest criminals in my county

67
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,590
On the fifth day of the sixth month

68
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,300
Sky attended a Wei-Qi house

69
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,770
I had learned he enjoyed playing Wei-Qi

70
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,810
And listening to music there

71
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,990
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace

72
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,730
We are here to arrest you!

73
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,640
Identify yourself by showing your spear

74
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,590
Halt!

75
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,080
What can a minor official do?

76
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,270
This is my territory

77
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
So?

78
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,850
You are on the King's most wanted list

79
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,620
I am placing you under arrest

80
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,940
Old man

81
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,250
Please play one more tune

82
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,880
Martial arts and music are different

83
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,790
But they share the same principle

84
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,080
Both stress attaining a supreme state

85
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,390
Sky and I faced each other
for a long time

86
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,490
Neither of us moved

87
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,430
We fought the battle in our minds

88
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,030
How swift thy sword!

89
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,310
I thought I knew everything
about my Kingdom

90
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,180
I didn't know that Leng Meng County

91
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,650
Held a talent like yours

92
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,780
Broken Sword

93
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,590
Flying Snow

94
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,230
By order of His Majesty!

95
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,090
Flying Snow and Broken Sword

96
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,890
Have teamed up for assassination

97
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,660
He who kills either of them

98
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,500
Will receive gold and land

99
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,800
And be allowed to drink

100
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,640
Within ten paces of His Majesty

101
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:53,980
Three years ago, Flying Snow

102
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,560
Stormed the palace with Broken Sword

103
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,420
Three thousand of my elite troops
couldn't stop them

104
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,650
I've since emptied the palace

105
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,360
So assassins cannot hide

106
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,900
Was your sword swifter
than theirs combined?

107
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,340
No

108
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,070
How did you do it, then?

109
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,950
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao

110
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,590
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao

111
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,350
I learned they were hiding

112
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,160
In a calligraphy school

113
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,260
Under the names
Highcliff and Springbrook

114
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,690
Rumor had it

115
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,760
The Qin army would attack that day

116
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,300
Most of the townspeople had fled

117
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,500
Only the school's students remained

118
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,840
Why have you come at such a time?

119
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,100
Who are you?

120
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,280
I'm from Yi County
in the Kingdom of Zhao

121
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,810
My father's dying wish

122
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,950
Was for one of your scrolls

123
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,550
I fear this may be
our school's last day

124
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,620
Which calligrapher do you seek?

125
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,560
I respectfully request
Master Highcliff

126
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,200
Highcliff was Broken Sword

127
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Legend said his skill as a swordsman

128
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,530
Was rooted in his calligraphy

129
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,740
So I had my concerns

130
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,270
I needed to find out if it was true

131
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,170
What do you want written?

132
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,540
"Sword."

133
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,640
You are fond of the sword?

134
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,090
It was my father's dying wish

135
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,490
What size scroll?

136
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,690
Eight feet

137
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,600
For that size I will need red ink

138
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,470
My master asked me

139
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,240
To borrow some red ink

140
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,370
My master wants to borrow some red ink

141
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,850
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

142
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,750
Master Highcliff
wants to borrow red ink

143
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,330
Tell him to come himself

144
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,980
Could I have some red ink?

145
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,080
The character "sword"
was still being written

146
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,920
When Your Majesty's troops

147
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,180
Arrived at the city gates

148
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,380
Draw!

149
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,460
Your Majesty's army is invincible

150
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,120
Not only because it is brave

151
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,200
But also because of its archery

152
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,300
With a greater range
than any other army

153
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,300
The Qin archers are like artillery

154
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,960
Intimidating the enemy

155
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,190
Hail! Hail! Hail!

156
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,540
Please remember

157
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,630
Their arrows might destroy our town

158
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,570
And topple our Kingdom

159
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,480
But they can never
obliterate our culture

160
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,170
Today

161
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,850
You will learn
the essence of our culture

162
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,170
Hail! Hail! Hail!

163
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,610
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

164
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,810
They drew strength
from their calligraphy

165
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,640
What was so difficult about "sword"?

166
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,470
There are nineteen different ways
to write it

167
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,150
I asked Broken Sword

168
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,250
For a twentieth way

169
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,540
Both calligraphy and swordplay

170
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,050
rely on one's strength and spirit

171
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,350
The twentieth style would reveal

172
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,620
The essence of his swordsmanship

173
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,790
How odd to write it in nineteen ways

174
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,720
It makes the written language

175
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,500
Impossible to comprehend

176
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,290
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms

177
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,940
And all the northern tribes

178
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,700
I will eradicate this problem

179
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
By mandating one style of writing

180
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,650
Wouldn't that be ideal?

181
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,970
Your Majesty won't stop
at the six Kingdoms?

182
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,950
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

183
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,880
I will lead my army
to conquer vast lands

184
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,950
And establish a great empire

185
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,530
Hail! Hail! Hail!

186
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,190
Master Springbrook

187
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,060
Why are you going outside?

188
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,690
To fend off the arrows

189
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,120
You aren't needed. Stay inside

190
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,600
The Qin archers are powerful

191
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,770
You alone may not stop them

192
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,200
Hail! Hail! Hail!

193
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,870
You are good

194
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,830
You are even better

195
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,740
You didn't come here for calligraphy

196
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Who are you?

197
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,410
I've travelled here to deliver an item

198
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,350
Please meet me
in the library at midnight

199
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,620
Great calligraphy

200
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,120
Great swordplay

201
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,620
You didn't even see my swordplay

202
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,560
I couldn't have written without it

203
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,000
At midnight

204
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,370
Meet me in the library

205
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,710
Several thousand Qin troops

206
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,500
Were readying for the next onslaught

207
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,980
I studied the character all night

208
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,980
Trying to unlock
the secret of his skills

209
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,730
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

210
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,630
But it's just an ordinary word

211
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,840
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar

212
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,870
One must comprehend their true essence

213
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,070
Did you discover it?

214
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,640
It eluded me

215
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,850
So how did you challenge them?

216
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,190
Sky died by your sword?

217
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,400
Yes

218
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,130
Who are you? Why are you here?

219
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,010
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin

220
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,010
I have a message from Sky

221
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Go on

222
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,690
He said he had lived a life

223
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,580
Without responsibilities or commitments

224
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,720
He cared for only one person

225
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,950
Who?

226
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,380
Flying Snow

227
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,570
Sky was certain
she would avenge his death

228
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:11,310
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp

229
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,530
You can leave now

230
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,540
Go!

231
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,500
I know you saw us!

232
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,010
I let you see us on purpose!

233
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,950
I no longer care about you at all!

234
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,850
We were both very foolish

235
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,010
I'm not going to fight you

236
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,310
Go away!

237
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,740
I will kill you
in honor of my master!

238
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,140
You ask to die. I will help you.

239
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,390
Why do you laugh?

240
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,250
What you did last night was stupid

241
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,130
My plan proved successful

242
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,400
When Flying Snow was fighting me

243
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,510
She was disturbed and disoriented

244
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,840
I defeated her easily

245
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,890
I never imagined supreme warriors

246
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,860
Like Broken Sword and Flying Snow

247
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,860
Allowing their emotions
to be a liability

248
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,290
It sounds as if you did divide them

249
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Yes

250
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,950
In that case, they must have been

251
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,090
Petty and narrow-minded

252
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,320
True

253
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,190
Your story sounds logical

254
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,490
But

255
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,570
You have underestimated one person.

256
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Who?

257
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,740
Me

258
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,110
Would you like
my impression of them?

259
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,680
Three years ago
they stormed the palace

260
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,950
I was impressed

261
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,580
By their valor and dignity

262
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,550
Their character could not be petty

263
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,790
So Flying Snow's affair
with Sky is a lie

264
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,620
Their betrayal of one another
is a lie

265
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,760
The story you just told is a lie!

266
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,230
Except for one thing

267
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,170
Sky did know one of you

268
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,400
Who?

269
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,870
You

270
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,940
I surmise you two were old friends

271
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,520
And Sky's defeat
has only one explanation

272
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,740
What is that?

273
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,190
He permitted it

274
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,120
To kill me, the two of you
formed a pact

275
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,200
Using my men as witnesses

276
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,500
That was not hard to arrange

277
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,940
The hardest part was to persuade Sky

278
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,440
To put his life in your hands

279
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,440
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky

280
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,380
He died willingly under your sword

281
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,950
Such devotion deserves true respect

282
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,690
He was the first to sacrifice himself

283
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,750
For your mission

284
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,720
Sky was ambitious and proud

285
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,560
He saw himself as an unrivalled fighter

286
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,460
What convinced him you could succeed

287
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,120
Where he had failed?

288
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,300
You have trained,
perhaps for ten years

289
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,730
With one goal: my assassination

290
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,540
You have a great skill
that few can counter

291
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,490
Killing Sky got you
within twenty paces of me

292
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,460
So why seek out
Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

293
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,900
I surmise that your skill

294
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,060
Requires you to come within ten paces

295
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,100
You needed a second sacrifice

296
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,970
To claim another reward

297
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,730
To bring you within ten paces

298
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,110
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow

299
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,180
Had never met Sky

300
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,470
They instantly understood

301
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,080
The reason for his defeat

302
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,390
How far am I from the bookshelves?

303
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,090
About ten paces

304
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,340
Ten paces is fine

305
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,650
I need one of you to help me

306
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,480
Please decide between yourselves

307
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,340
Meet me at the Qin camp
tomorrow morning

308
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,460
How swift thy sword!

309
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,190
True

310
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,070
Sky was a superior warrior

311
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,170
He willingly gave his life
to this man

312
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,210
He can kill the King

313
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,950
We must proceed

314
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,720
That means... we will die

315
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,060
Then we die together

316
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,760
You were one step ahead of me

317
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,640
Did I hurt you too much?

318
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,380
I should be the one who fights him

319
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,350
I want you to live

320
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,420
If you died, how could I live?

321
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,450
You will live on... promise me

322
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,900
Say it!

323
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,010
All right

324
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,730
Moon is on her way

325
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,230
I had better go
