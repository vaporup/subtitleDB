1
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,751
<i>My name is H I McDunnough.</i>

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,031
<i>Call me Hi.</i>

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,678
<i>The first time I met Ed was in
the county lockup in Tempe, Arizona.</i>

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,038
- Don't forget his profile, Ed!
- Turn to the right!

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,111
<i>A day I'll never forget.</i>

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,559
Turn to the right!

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,359
What kind of name is that
for a pretty thing like you?

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,590
Short for Edwina. Turn to the right!

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,992
You're a flower, you are.
Just a little desert flower.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,114
Let me know how those come out.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,955
<i>Now, prison life is very structured...
more than most people care for.</i>

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,998
<i>But a spirit of comradery
exists between the men</i>

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,435
<i>like you find only in combat, maybe,</i>

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,557
<i>or on a pro ball club
in the heat of the pennant drive.</i>

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,116
<i>In an effort to better ourselves,
we had to meet with a counsellor,</i>

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,079
<i>who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were.</i>

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,152
And all Pancho wanted
was a hot roll and butter.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,313
So... why do you use the word "trapped"?

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,877
- Huh?
- Why do you say you feel "trapped"

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,836
in a man's body?

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,356
Well, sometimes I get
the menstrual cramps real hard.

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,036
- Have you learned anything, Hi?
- Yes, sir. You bet.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,432
- You wouldn't lie to us, would you, Hi?
- No, ma'am, hope to say.

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,669
OK, then.

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,794
<i>I tried to stand up and fly straight,</i>

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,476
<i>but it wasn't easy with that
son of a bitch Reagan in the White House.</i>

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,274
<i>I don't know. They say he's a decent man.</i>

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,035
<i>So... maybe his advisors are confused.</i>

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,635
Turn to the right.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,875
What's the matter, Ed?

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,317
<i>- My fiance left me.
- She said her fianc√© had run off</i>

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,678
<i>with a student cosmetologist
who knew how to ply her feminine wiles.</i>

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,231
- The son of a bitch.
- Don't forget his phone call, Ed!

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,835
Tell him I think he's a damn fool, Ed.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,519
You tell him I said so, H I McDunnough.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,873
And if he wants to discuss it,
he knows where to find me.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,475
The Maricopa County maximum security
correctional facility for men,

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,111
State Farm Road, No.31,
Tempe, Arizona. I'll be waitin'!

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,438
I'll be waitin'.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,470
<i>I can't say I was happy to be back inside,</i>

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,556
<i>but the flood of familiar sights, sounds and
faces almost made it feel like a homecomin'.</i>

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,752
Most men your age are getting married
and raising up a family.

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,118
- Well, factually...
- They wouldn't accept prison as a substitute.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,350
Would any of you men care to comment?

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,433
Well, sometimes your career's
gotta come before family.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,598
Work's what's kept us happy.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,350
<i>I tried to sort through
what Doc Schwartz had said,</i>

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,113
<i>but prison ain't the easiest place to think.</i>

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,351
And when there was no meat, we ate fowl.

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,352
And when there was no fowl, we ate crawdad.

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,637
And when there was no crawdad
to be found, we ate san'.

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,915
- You ate what?
- We ate san'.

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,988
- You ate sand?
- That's right.

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,548
Well, Hi, you done served your 20 months.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,668
And seein' as how you never use live ammo,
we got no choice but to return you to society.

56
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,356
- These doors are gonna swing wide.
- I didn't wanna hurt anyone, sir.

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,637
- Hi, we respect that.
- But you're just hurting yourself

58
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,429
- with this rambunctious behaviour.
- I know that, sir.

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,669
OK, then.

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,036
<i>I don't know how you come down
on the incarceration question,</i>

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,032
<i>whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge,</i>

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>but I was beginning to think revenge
is the only argument makes any sense.</i>

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,350
Show the tattoo!

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,159
- Turn to the right!
- Don't forget his fingers, Ed.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,995
Hear about the paddy wagon
collided with the cement mixer, Ed?

66
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,719
Twelve hardened criminals escaped.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,149
I heard that one.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,232
- Got a new beau?
- No, Hi, I sure don't.

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,274
Don't worry, I paid for it.

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,353
<i>They say that absence
makes the heart grow fonder.</i>

71
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,396
<i>And, for once, they may be right.</i>

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,436
You missed a spot.

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,512
<i>More and more my thoughts turned to Ed</i>

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,070
<i>and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment.</i>

75
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,073
Mama would throw the live crawdad
in a pan of boilin' water.

76
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,470
Well, one day I decided
to make my own crawdad.

77
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,599
And I threw it in a pot,
without the water, you see?

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,150
And it was just like makin' popcorn, you see?

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,472
<i>Yeah, the joint's a lonely place
after lockup and lights out,</i>

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,075
<i>when the last of the cons
has been swept away by the sandman.</i>

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,040
<i>But I couldn't help thinkin'
that a brighter future lay ahead.</i>

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,113
<i>A future that was only
eight to fourteen months away.</i>

83
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,598
They got a name for people like you, Hi.

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,992
- That name is called "recidivism".
- Repeat offender!

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,073
- Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?
- No, sir. That's one bonehead name.

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,709
- But that ain't me any more.
- Are you just tellin' us what we wanna hear?

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,634
- No, sir, no way.
- Cos we just wanna hear the truth.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,792
Well, then I guess I am
tellin' you what you wanna hear.

89
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,793
- Boy, didn't we just tell you not to do that?
- Yes, sir.

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,199
OK, then.

91
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,951
Turn to the right!

92
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,635
I'm walkin' in here on my knees,
Ed, a free man, proposin'.

93
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,914
Howdy, Curt.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,276
<i>- And so it was.
- Don't forget the bouquet, Ed!</i>

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,515
- I do.
- You bet I do.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,591
OK, then.

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,635
<i>Ed's pa staked us to a starter home
in suburban Tempe</i>

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
<i>and I got a job drillin'holes in sheet metal.</i>

99
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,069
So we were doin' paramedical work
with the state highway system.

100
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,756
Not actually practisin', you understand.
Me and Bill's patrollin' down Nine Mile...

101
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,436
- Bill Roberts?
- No, not that mother-scratcher. Bill Parker.

102
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,715
Anyway, we're approachin' the wreck

103
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,759
and there's this spherical object
restin' in the highway.

104
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,796
And it's not a piece o' the car.

105
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,589
<i>Most ways, the job was a lot like prison,</i>

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,196
<i>except Ed was waitin'at the end of every day
and a pay cheque at the end of every week.</i>

107
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,999
Government do take a bite, don't she?

108
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,238
<i>These were the happy days,
the salad days, as they say,</i>

109
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,279
<i>and Ed felt that havin'a critter
was the next logical step.</i>

110
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,715
<i>It was all she thought about.</i>

111
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,828
<i>Her point was that there was too much
love and beauty for just the two of us.</i>

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,711
<i>Every day we kept a child out of the world
was a day he might later regret havin'missed.</i>

113
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,192
That was beautiful.

114
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,831
<i>So we worked at it on the days
we calculated most likely to be fruitful.</i>

115
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,435
<i>And we worked at it
most other days, just to be sure.</i>

116
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,834
<i>Ed rejoiced that my lawless years were behind
me and that our child-rearing years lay ahead.</i>

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,115
<i>And then the roof caved in.</i>

118
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,796
Hi... I'm barren!

119
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,871
<i>At first I didn't believe it.</i>

120
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,115
<i>That this woman, who looked as fertile as
the Tennessee valley, could not bear children.</i>

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,476
<i>But the doctor explained that
her insides were a rocky place</i>

122
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,154
<i>where my seed could find no purchase.</i>

123
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,715
<i>Ed was inconsolable.</i>

124
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,269
<i>We tried an adoption agency.</i>

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,959
It's true that Hi has had a chequered past.

126
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,398
But Ed here is an officer of the law twice
decorated, so we figure it kinda evens out.

127
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,839
<i>But biology and the prejudices of others
conspired to keep us childless.</i>

128
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,630
<i>Our love for each other
was stronger than ever.</i>

129
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,554
<i>But I preminisced...
no return of the salad days.</i>

130
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,398
<i>The pizzazz had gone out of our lives.</i>

131
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,476
<i>Ed lost all interest in both
criminal justice and housekeepin'.</i>

132
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,398
<i>Soon after, she tendered her badge.</i>

133
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,519
<i>Even my job seemed as dry
and bitter as a hot prairie wind.</i>

134
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,636
So here's Bill, walkin' down Nine Mile...
That's Bill Parker, you understand.

135
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,510
He's got his sandwich in one hand
and a fuckin' head in the other!

136
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,439
<i>I even caught myself
drivin' by convenience stores</i>

137
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,629
<i>that weren't on the way home.</i>

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,914
<i>Then one day, the biggest news hit
the state since they built the Hoover Dam.</i>

139
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,079
<i>The Arizona quints was born.</i>

140
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,554
<i>By "Arizona quints"I mean they was
born to a woman named Florence Arizona.</i>

141
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,032
<i>As you probably guessed, Florence Arizona
is the wife of Nathan Arizona.</i>

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,714
<i>And Nathan Arizona... Well, hell,</i>

143
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,799
<i>you know who he is.</i>

144
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,111
<i>So come on down to Unpainted Arizona</i>

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,397
<i>to get the finest selection
in fixtures and appointments</i>

146
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,074
<i>for your bathroom, bedroom, boudoir.</i>

147
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,234
<i>And if you can find lower prices anywhere,
my name ain't Nathan Arizona!</i>

148
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,153
<i>Owner of the largest chain
of unpainted furniture</i>

149
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,074
<i>and bathroom fixture
outlets throughout the Southwest.</i>

150
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,598
<i>Yep, Florence had been takin'fertility pills
and she and Nathan had hit the jackpot.</i>

151
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,756
<i>Now, y'all without sin can cast the first stone.</i>

152
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,559
<i>We thought it was unfair
some should have so many</i>

153
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,029
<i>while others should have so few.</i>

154
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,791
<i>With the benefit of hindsight,
maybe it wasn't such a hot idea.</i>

155
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,713
<i>But, at the time, Ed's little plan seemed
like the solution to all our problems</i>

156
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,308
<i>and the answer to all our prayers.</i>

157
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,512
800 leaf tables and no chairs?

158
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,114
You can't sell leaf tables and no chairs.

159
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,351
Chairs, you got a dinette set.
No chairs, you got dick!

160
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,317
I ask my wife, she got more sense.

161
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,359
Miles, alls I know is I'm away from the office
for a few days to play with my kids

162
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,637
and everything goes
straight to heck! I won't stand for it!

163
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,636
If a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass
a- hoppin'. I am sick of your excuses, Miles!

164
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,032
It is now precisely... 8.45 in the PM.

165
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,191
I'm gonna be down that store in
exactly 12 hours to kick me some butt!

166
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,669
Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

167
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,393
Sounds like Larry.

168
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,511
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,637
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

170
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,075
Quiet, quiet.

171
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,431
OK, all right.

172
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,271
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

173
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,991
That's it. Good.

174
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,515
Here's a rattle. A rattle.

175
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,031
OK? Good.

176
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,230
No, no. Quiet, quiet.

177
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,391
Come here.

178
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,149
Please come here. Come here.

179
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,468
Why don't you go up and check on 'em?
They sound restless.

180
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,236
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry, honey. Itjust didn't work out.

181
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,517
- What do you mean it didn't work out?
- Well, they...

182
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,958
They started cryin' and they were all over me.
It was kinda horrifyin', honey. Let me in.

183
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,759
- Of course they cried. Babies cry.
- Well, I know that.

184
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,991
- Come on, honey. We'd better leave.
- Go back and get me a toddler.

185
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,152
I need a baby, Hi.
They got more than they can handle.

186
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,710
- Honey, I...
- Don't you come back here without a baby!

187
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,755
Christian Dior, my butt!

188
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,278
- They pay money for that?
- Yes, dear.

189
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,874
- How're the kids?
- Fine, dear.

190
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,793
- Which one you get?
- I don't know. Nathan Junior, I think.

191
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,155
- Gimme here.
- Here's the instructions.

192
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,434
He's beautiful.

193
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,671
Yeah, he's awful damn good.
I think I got the best one.

194
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,070
I bet they were all beautiful.
All babies are beautiful.

195
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,038
- This one's awful damn good.
- Don't you cuss around him.

196
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,274
- He's fine, he is. I think it's Nathan Junior.
- We are doin' the right thing, aren't we, Hi?

197
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,079
- They had more than they could handle.
- Well, honey,

198
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,039
we've been over this.
There's what's right and there's what's right.

199
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,113
- Never the twain shall meet.
- But don't you think his mama'll be upset?

200
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,988
Well, of course she'll be upset,
sugar, but she'll get over it.

201
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,993
She's got four little babies
almost as good as this one.

202
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,436
It's like robbin' convenience stores.

203
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,990
I love him so much!

204
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,758
- I know you do, honey.
- I love him so much!

205
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,156
I know you do.

206
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,596
OK. Bring him in!

207
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,515
This is it, young Nathan Junior!
You can feast your eyes about, old boy!

208
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,989
- Don't be so loud around him.
- Damn, I'm sorry.

209
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,231
- Don't cuss around him.
- He don't know a cuss word from Shinola.

210
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,596
- Well, you see that he don't.
- I wanna hold him too.

211
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,559
- Well, mind his little fontanelle.
- He's all right, he is.

212
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,679
Come on over here, young Nathan Junior.
I'm gonna show you around.

213
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,751
Lookee here, young sportsman.

214
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,230
That there's the kitchen area,
where Ma and Pa chow down.

215
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,440
This here's the TV. Two hours a day
maximum, either educational or football,

216
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,832
so as you don't ruin
your appreciation of the finer things.

217
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,278
And this here's the divan, for socialisin'
and relaxin' with the family unit.

218
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,875
Yes, sir. Many's the day
we sat there and we said

219
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,639
"Wouldn't it be nice to have a youngster
to share our thoughts and feelings?"

220
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,508
- He's tired, Hi.
- Well, I'll just sit you right there, boy.

221
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,398
Just put those dogs up and take a load off.

222
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,118
What, are you kiddin'?
We got us a family here!

223
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,232
He's a scandal, honey. He's a little outlaw.

224
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,317
No, he's a good boy.

225
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,870
He ain't too good.
You can tell by that twinkle in his eye.

226
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,758
- Don't you think we oughta put him to bed?
- Hang on, honey.

227
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,833
- Let's just preserve the moment in pictures.
- Just one, OK?

228
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,350
I gotta tell ya... I'm a little scared, Hi.

229
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
- How come is that, honey?
- Well...

230
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,470
We got a baby, Hi.
It's an awful big responsibility.

231
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,518
Honey, could you slide over a tad
and raise the nipper up?

232
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,832
I mean, we never done this before
and I'm kinda nervous.

233
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,070
You're doin' real good, sugar.

234
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,555
- I love you, Hi.
- We're set to pop here, honey.

235
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,712
- Now, you're gonna help, aren't you?
- How's that, honey?

236
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,270
Contribute to the management of the child.

237
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,028
- Quiet evenings together.
- You can count on it.

238
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,998
Everything decent and normal
from here on out.

239
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,275
We're set to pop here, honey.

240
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,708
- OK.
- What is she?

241
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,995
Station wagon. Looks nice.

242
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,231
Open up! It's the police!

243
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,390
- Hi, what's goin' on?
- You stay in here.

244
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,631
- Open up!
- They ain't gonna split up the family.

245
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,190
- Open up in there!
- I'd like to see 'em try.

246
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,358
Open up! Maybe we'll let you plea bargain!

247
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,156
- Hi there, you old woodpecker!
- Boys!

248
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,473
Gale, don't make me sick!

249
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,312
Asshole!

250
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,028
Honey, I'd like you to meet Gale
and Evelle Snopes.

251
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,196
As fine a pair as ever broke and entered!

252
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,438
Boys... this here's my wife.

253
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,155
- Ma'am.
- Ms McDunnough.

254
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,199
- Kinda late for visitors, isn't it, Hi?
- Well, yeah, honey.

255
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,239
But these boys just got outta the joint,
so we gotta show a little hospitality.

256
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,677
Well, now, H I. Looks like you've
been up to the devil's business.

257
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,552
- Hey, is that a him or a her?
- It's a little boy.

258
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,991
- Got a name, does he?
- So far we just been usin' Junior.

259
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,392
- We call him Junior.
- You mean JR, just like the TV show?

260
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,518
- That's good!
- "Welcome home, son."

261
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,833
Where's he been?

262
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,956
- Phoenix.
- Tulsa.

263
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,396
- He was visitin' his grandparents.
- They're separated.

264
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,790
- That'd be your folks, ma'am.
- No, I'm afraid not.

265
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,314
Well, you said your folks was dead, H I.

266
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,552
Well, we thought Junior
should see their final restin' place.

267
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,029
Why don't you boys have a seat?

268
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,955
Hi, it's two in the mornin'.

269
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,996
What's that smell?

270
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,548
We don't always smell this way,
Ms McDunnough.

271
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,110
I was explainin' to your better half
that, when we were tunnellin' out,

272
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,476
we happened to hit the main sewer line.
Dumb luck, that.

273
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,279
- And we followed that to...
- You busted outtajail?

274
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,432
No, ma'am. We released ourselves
on our own recognisance.

275
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,310
What Evelle is tryin' to say is we felt the
institution no longer had anything to offer us.

276
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,756
- My Lord, he's cute!
- He's a little outlaw. You can see that, Hi.

277
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,638
Now, listen, you folks can't stay here.

278
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,471
- Ma'am?
- You just can't stay.

279
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,553
I appreciate you bein' friends of Hi an' all,
but this is a decent family now.

280
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,915
I mean, we got a toddler here.

281
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,114
Say, who wears the pants round here, H I?

282
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,116
- Honey, these boys just got outta the joint...
- Don't "honey" me!

283
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,671
Now you boys can sit awhile and catch up,
but then you be on your way.

284
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,478
Got you on an awful short leash,
don't she, H I?

285
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,791
They still here?

286
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,635
Yeah.
They're just gonna stay a day or two, honey.

287
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,553
It's rainin' out, they got nowheres to go...

288
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,509
They're fugitives, Hi. How're we gonna
start a new life with them around?

289
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,071
Well, now, honey,
you gotta have a little charity.

290
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,875
You know,
in Arab lands, they'd set out a plate.

291
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,349
Promise just a day or two.

292
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,229
Tonight and tomorrow, tops.

293
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,629
<i>That night I had a dream.</i>

294
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,950
<i>I drifted off, thinkin'about
happiness, birth and new life.</i>

295
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,478
<i>But now I was haunted by a vision of...</i>

296
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,350
<i>He was horrible.</i>

297
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,277
<i>The lone biker of the Apocalypse.</i>

298
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,793
<i>A man with all the powers
of Hell at his command.</i>

299
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,397
<i>He could turn the day into night</i>

300
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,472
<i>and lay to waste everything in his path.</i>

301
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,319
<i>He was especially hard on the little things,
the helpless and the gentle creatures.</i>

302
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,709
<i>He left a scorched earth in his wake,</i>

303
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,316
<i>befoulin' even the sweet desert breeze
that whipped across his brow.</i>

304
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,151
<i>I didn't know where he came from or why.</i>

305
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,038
<i>I didn't know if he was dream or vision.</i>

306
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,553
<i>But I feared that I myself had unleashed him.</i>

307
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,878
<i>For he was the fury that would be,</i>

308
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,953
<i>as soon as Florence Arizona
found her little Nathan gone.</i>

309
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,310
<i>' Father sits at his cabin door</i>

310
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,232

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,193
- You all right?
- Well, he's all right.

314
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,589
He was just havin' a nightmare.

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,077
Sometimes it's a hard world for little things.

320
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,037
Now, the missis and the rest
of the kids have left town

321
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,399
to... I ain't sayin' where. They'll be back
here when we're a nuclear family again.

322
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,268
- Mr Arizona, which tot was abducted?
- Nathan Junior, I think.

323
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,875
- Anything to say to the kidnappers?
- Yeah. Watch your butts!

324
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,349
It's rumoured your son
was abducted by UFOs.

325
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,477
- Would you care to comment?
- Don't print that, son.

326
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,757
If his mama reads that,
she's just gonna lose all hope.

327
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,877
Sir, we really need to
ask you some more questions.

328
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,238
But remember it's still
business as usual at Unpainted Arizona.

329
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,599
If you can find lower prices anywhere,
my name still ain't Nathan Arizona!

330
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,710
Mr Byrum here can take
your exemplars while you talk.

331
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,995
Just relax your hand. I'll do the work.

332
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,868
- What is this? I didn't steal the damn kid!
- Sir, these men are with the FBI.

333
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,236
Are you crazy? Alls I know is,
I wake up and my wife's screamin'.

334
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,474
We just need to distinguish your prints
from the perpetrator, if they left any.

335
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,429
- Of course. I know that.
- Sir, were you born Nathan Huffhines?

336
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,830
- Yeah, I changed my name. What of it?
- Can you tell us why?

337
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,832
Yeah. Would you buy furniture
at "Unpainted Huffhines"?

338
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,071
- I'll get to the point...
- Was the child wearing anything?

339
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,118
- Nobody sleeps naked in this house!
- I'll ask the questions!

340
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,430
To put an APB out, I need a description.

341
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,308
We're better trained to intervene
in a crisis situation. What was he wearing?

342
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,073
A dinnerjacket. What do you think?
His damn jammies!

343
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,470
- He was wearing his jammies. Happy?
- Any disgruntled employees?

344
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,711
Hell, they're all disgruntled.
I ain't runnin' a daisy farm.

345
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,839
- I say do it my way or watch your butt!
- So it might have been an employee?

346
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,230
Without my say-so, they wouldn't
piss with their pants on fire.

347
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,756
- What did the pyjamas look like?
- I don't know. They were jammies!

348
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,630
They had Yodas and shit on 'em.
Get your damn feet off my coffee table!

349
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,315
- Ron, you are upsetting the victim!
- Are you boys gonna chase your leads

350
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,110
or sit drinkin' coffee in the one house
in the state where I know my boy ain't at?

351
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,237
Well, we don't have any leads as yet,
aside from the coat.

352
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,039
Gimme that! That's a $500 camel's-hair coat.

353
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,271
Sir, you might want
to wash your hands at this point.

354
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,074
Goddammit!

355
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,076
No leads! Everyone leaves microbes and
whatnot. Hell, that's your forte, ain't it?

356
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,311
Trackin' down microbes left by
criminals and commies and shit.

357
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,755
That's your whole raison d'√™tre, ain't it?

358
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,960
No leads! I want Nathan Junior back! Or
whichever the hell one of 'em they took!

359
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,749
He's out there somewhere.
Somethin' leads to him!

360
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,833
Anyone can find him knows the difference
between a lead and a hole in the ground!

361
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,832
Awful good cereal flakes, Ms McDunnough.

362
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,355
Why ain't you breast-feedin'?

363
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,791
You appear to be capable.

364
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,871
- Mind your own business.
- Ma'am,

365
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,953
you don't breast-feed him, he hates you
later. That's why we wound up in prison.

366
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,873
Anyway, that's what Doc Schwartz tells us.

367
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,951
Boys.

368
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,511
Mornin', Hi.

369
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,357
Hi...

370
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,030
Oh, yeah.

371
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,238
Say, boys...

372
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,996
You wouldn't mind makin' yourselves scarce
for a coupla hours this afternoon, would ya?

373
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,913
We're havin' some decent friends over.

374
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,790
What Ed means to say is...

375
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,917
seein' as you two boys are wanted,

376
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,949
it wouldn't exactly do to have folks seein'
you here. It's for your own protection.

377
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,998
- Sure, H I.
- Anything you say, Hi.

378
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,953
Matter of fact, honey,
I think I'll skip this little get-together myself.

379
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,591
Glen won't mind. I'll just duck out with
the boys, knock back a coupla co-colas.

380
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,193
- Sure, H I.
- We'd love to have you, Hi.

381
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,276
Maybe that ain't such a swell idea, either.

382
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,709
So many social engagements,

383
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,951
so little time.

384
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,639
Where's that baby? Where is he at?

385
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,757
- Go find him, honey!
- Cut it out, Glen!

386
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,831
He's asleep right now.

387
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,956
Shit! I hope we didn't wake it!

388
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,634
Can I just sneak a peek-a-loo?

389
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,715
Come on, kids!
Get away from Mr McDunnough's car!

390
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,235
What's his name?

391
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,999
Hi... Hi Junior, till we think of a better one.

392
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,479
Why don't ya call him Jason?
I love biblical names.

393
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,552
If I had another little boy,
I'd name him Jason, Caleb or Tab.

394
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,115
He's an angel!
He's an angel straight from heaven!

395
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,316
Now honey, I had all my kids the hard way.

396
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,313
Tell me how you got this little angel.
Did he fly straight down from heaven?

397
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,278
- Well...
- You're gonna send him to Arizona State.

398
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,111
Gimme a Twinkie!

399
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,030
- You need a beer, Glen?
- Does the Pope wear a funny hat?

400
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,157
Yeah, Glen, I guess it is kinda funny.

401
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,155
Say, that reminds me. How many Polacks
does it take to screw up a light bulb?

402
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,549
I don't know, Glen. One?

403
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,631
No, it takes three.

404
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,632
I told it wrong. I'll start again. How come it
takes three Polacks to screw up a light bulb?

405
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,599
- I don't know, Glen.
- Cos they're so darn stupid!

406
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,108
Shit, man! Listen up!
What's the matter? Don't ya get it?

407
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,710
- No, Glen, I sure don't.
- Well, shit, man.

408
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,075
I guess that's why they call it a way-homer.

409
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,038
- Why's that?
- Cos you only get it on the way home.

410
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,792
I'm already home, Glen.

411
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,076
You wet yourself! You wet yourself!

412
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,038
Mr McDunnough wet himself, Daddy!

413
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,839
Say, that reminds me.
How'd you get that kid so fast?

414
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,673
Me and Dot went to adopt -
somethin' wrong with my semen.

415
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,274
They said we had to wait
five years for a healthy white baby.

416
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,909
I said "Healthy white baby, five years?
OK, what else you got?"

417
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,915
They said they got two Koreans and
a Negro born with his heart on the outside.

418
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,878
- It's a crazy world.
- Someone oughta sell tickets.

419
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,951
Sure. I'd buy one.

420
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,475
That Buford's a sly one.
He already knows his ABCs. Watch this.

421
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,869
Hit the deck, boy!

422
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,918
But like I'm sayin', how'd you get the kid?

423
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,549
Well, this whole thing is just who knows who.

424
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,590
Then over here you have favouritism.

425
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,875
Ed has a friend at one of the agencies.

426
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,669
Maybe she can help me and Dot.
There's somethin' wrong with my semen.

427
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,035
What you gonna name it?

428
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,236
Ed. Ed Junior.

429
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,677
- But I thought you said it was a boy.
- Well, as in Edward. We just like that name.

430
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,513
It's a good one.
I don't really need another kid,

431
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,239
but Dot says these are
gettin' too big to cuddle.

432
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,311
Say, that reminds me...

433
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,312
Mind you don't cut yourself, Mordecai.

434
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,272
Then there's diphtheria-tetanus,
what they call dip-tet.

435
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,638
They need dip-tet boosters yearly,
or they develop lockjaw and night vision.

436
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,996
Then there's the smallpox vaccine,
chicken pox and measles.

437
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,153
If your kid's like ours, you'll have to get
all those shots before he'll take 'em.

438
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,473
- Who's your paediatrician?
- We ain't exactly fixed on one yet, have we?

439
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,277
- No, I guess we don't have one yet.
- Jesus! Well, you gotta have one this instant!

440
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,353
- What if the baby gets sick, honey?
- Even if he don't, he's gotta have his dip-tet.

441
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,273
He's gotta have his dip-tet, honey.

442
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,148
- You started his bank accounts yet?
- Have we done that? We gotta do that.

443
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,835
- What's that for, Dot?
- His orthodonture and his university.

444
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,948
Use iodine, you might save on orthodonture.
Won't knock a thing off the university.

445
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,272
Riley! You take that diaper off your head!
You put it back onto your sister!

446
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,830
Anyway, you probably got
the life insurance all squared away.

447
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,150
Have we done that yet, honey?

448
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,594
Gotta do that, Hi.

449
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,513
- Ed's got her hands full with this angel.
- Yes, ma'am.

450
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,912
What would Ed and little angel do if a truck
splattered your brains over the interstate?

451
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,594
Yeah, honey. What if you get run over?

452
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,592
Or you got carried off by a twister?

453
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,233
Say, that reminds me. You hear about
the person of Polish persuasion?

454
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,153
He walks into a bar with this
big pile of shit in his hand

455
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,959
and says "Look what I almost stepped in!"

456
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,034
- Yeah, that's funny all right.
- Damn right! Shit, man, what's the matter?

457
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,792
I don't know. Maybe it's...

458
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,912
the wife, kids, family life. I mean...

459
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,273
Are you satisfied, Glen?

460
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,994
Don't you ever feel... suffocated?

461
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,588
Like there's somethin' big pressin' down?

462
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,399
Yeah, I do know that feelin'.

463
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,358
And I told Dot to lose some weight,
but she don't wanna listen.

464
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,472
No, man, I know what you mean.
You got all these responsibilities now.

465
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,633
You're married, you got a kid,
it looks like your whole life is set down...

466
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,553
- Where's the excitement?
- Yeah, Glen, I guess that's it.

467
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,393
OK, that's a disease, but you got a cure.

468
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,595
Yeah?

469
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,717
Dr Glen is here to tell you
that you can heal thyself.

470
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,316
- What do I gotta do?
- Well, you just gotta broaden your mind.

471
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,312
Say if I was to ask you
"What do you think about Dot?"

472
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,789
Well, she's a fine woman you got there.

473
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,873
OK, now you might not know it
to look at her, but she's a hellcat.

474
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,633
- That right?
- T-l-G-E-R.

475
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,108
- Well, what's that gotta do with...
- Now, don't rush me.

476
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,395
The thing about Dot is...

477
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,074
She told me this. She thinks...

478
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,868
She thinks you're cute.

479
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,311
Yeah?

480
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,916
I'm crappin' you negative.
And I could say the same thing about Ed.

481
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,117
- What are you talkin' about, Glen?
- What am I talkin' about?

482
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,839
I'm talkin' about sex.
What are you talkin' about?

483
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,390
<i>I'm talkin' about I'amour.
I'm talkin' that me and Dot are swingers.</i>

484
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,678
As in, to swing.
I'm talkin' about wife-swappin'.

485
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,753
I'm talkin' about what they
call now "open marriage"...

486
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,718
Keep your goddamn hands off my wife.

487
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,197
I was only tryin' to help! You're crazy!

488
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,439
- You're crazy, man!
- Keep your goddamn hands off my wife!

489
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,590
You're crazy! I pity you!

490
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,596
We finally go out with some decent people
and you break his nose. That ain't funny, Hi.

491
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,468
- His kids seemed to think it was funny.
- Well, they're just kids.

492
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,951
You're a grown man with responsibilities.
Whatever possessed ya?

493
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,638
- He was provokin' me.
- How'd he do that?

494
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,677
- Never mind.
- But, Hi, he's your foreman.

495
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,149
He's just gonna fire you now.

496
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,479
- I expect he will.
- Where does that leave the three of us?

497
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,552
Where does that leave our entire family unit?

498
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,670
- With a man for a husband.
- That ain't no answer.

499
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,912
- Honey, that's the only answer.
- That ain't no answer.

500
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,195
With a man for a husband.

501
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,635
Nathan needs some Huggies.

502
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,350
I'll be out directly.

503
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,191
Mind you stay strapped in.

504
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,429
Wake up, son.

505
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,036
I'll be takin' these Huggies
and whatever cash you got.

506
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,352
"No, no, not by the hair on my
chinny-chin-chin" said the little pig.

507
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,510
Look at that. Look at him.

508
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,231
"Then I'll..."

509
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,717
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house in."

510
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,918
That son of a bitch.

511
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,191
That son of a bitch!

512
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,629
- You son of a bitch!
- Better hurry it up. I'm in Dutch with the wife.

513
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,719
You son of a bitch!

514
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,749
Come on now!

515
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,991
Honey?

516
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,314
That son of a bitch.

517
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,392
Hold on, Nathan.
We're gonna go pick up Daddy.

518
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,788
Son, you got a panty on your head.

519
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,950
Just drive fast, OK?

520
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,678
Wait. There's the wife.

521
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,718
Honey! Mind the baby now!

522
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,991
Hang on, Nathan.
We're gonna take a short cut.

523
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,549
Can I stop now?

524
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,713
Thank you.

525
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,350
<i>That's private property, son.</i>

526
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,436
<i>Come out to the street and reveal yourself
to Officer Steensma and Officer Scott.</i>

527
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,591
Son of a bitch!

528
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,798
Thank you, honey,
but you really didn't have to do this.

529
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,872
Son of a bitch!
What if me and the baby had been picked up?

530
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,838
- Turn left here.
- He'd be accessory to armed robbery.

531
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,391
- It ain't armed robbery if the gun ain't loaded.
- What kind of home life is it for a toddler?

532
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,789
- You supposed to be an example.
- For what?

533
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,589
I never postured myself as
a three-piece suit type. Turn right, honey.

534
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:00,038
- We got a child now! Everything's changed!
- Nathan Junior accepts me for what I am.

535
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,830
And I think you better had too.
You know, honey: I'm OK, you're OK.

536
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,639
- That there's what it is.
- I know, but, honey...

537
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,075
See, I come from a long line of frontiersmen.

538
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,197
Here it is, dear. Turn here.
Frontiersmen and outdoor types.

539
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,955
I'm not gonna live this way, Hi.
It just ain't family life.

540
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,316
<i>Well, it ain't Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

541
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,152
You two are leavin'. I got nothin' against you,
but you're wanted by the authorities.

542
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,789
And you're a bad influence
in this household in my opinion.

543
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,871
Well, ma'am...

544
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,149
We sure didn't mean to influence anybody.

545
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,708
And if we did, ma'am, we apologise.

546
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,510
I'm goin' tomorrow to see about shots for the
baby. When I come back, you better be gone.

547
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,229
What's he need, his dip-tet?

548
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,713
I'm awful sorry, boys, but when Ed gets mad,

549
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,553
you know, she gets an idea.

550
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,438
There ain't a thing to apologise for, H I.

551
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,072
Seems pretty clear what the situation is here.

552
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,954
Yeah.
I guess the missis wants us to clear out.

553
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,396
Now, H I, if you'll pardon me for sayin' so,

554
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,715
- I get the feelin' that this ain't workin' out.
- Edwina's generally a real sweetheart.

555
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,792
And, as per usual, I wouldn't be surprised

556
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,351
if the source of
the marital friction weren't financial.

557
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,877
As a matter of fact, I did lose my job today.

558
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,955
Hi, you're young and you got your health.
What you want with ajob?

559
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,794
But I'd rather light a candle
than curse your darkness.

560
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,079
Now, as you know, Evelle here and I never
go anywhere without there's a purpose.

561
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,914
And here we are in your little domicile.

562
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,872
- We come to invite you in on a little score.
- A bank, H I.

563
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,951
Come on now!

564
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,508
I know you're partial to
convenience stores, but dammit, H I,

565
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,112
the sun don't rise and set
on the corner grocery.

566
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,113
It's like Doc Schwartz says,
you gotta have a little bit of ambition.

567
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,399
We just watchin' on the news. Somebody
snatched up one of them Arizona babies.

568
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,669
- For chrissakes.
- That there's somebody who's thinkin' big.

569
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,073
And here you are, sittin' on your butt, playin'
house with a - don't get me wrong, H I -

570
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,915
with a fine woman, but a woman
who needs one of them button-down types.

571
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,120
- I don't particularly think that's any of your...
- Hold on, H I. Now lookee there.

572
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,872
That's a picture of El Dorado.

573
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,509
The locals call it the Farmers
and Mechanics Bank of La Grange.

574
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,115
Looks like a hayseed bank.
Tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank.

575
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,751
But the last Friday of every financial quarter,
it has more cash than flies at a barbecue.

576
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,833
- And guess what day it is tomorrow.
- When all the hayseeds come in and

577
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,514
cash their farm subsidies cheques.

578
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,830
- A1 information, Hi.
- Got it in the joint

579
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,391
from a guy named Lawrence Spivey, one of
Dick Nixon's undersecretary of agricultures.

580
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,550
In for soliciting sex from a state trooper.

581
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,950
Ordinarily we don't associate
with that type of person, but...

582
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,838
he was tryin' to make a few Brownie points.

583
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,638
Boys, I can't.

584
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,599
Hi, we need someone handy with
a scatter-gun, coverin' them hayseeds,

585
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,910
while we go in there and get that cash.

586
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,152
You understand, H I? If this works out,
it's just the beginning of a spree

587
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,917
to cover the entire Southwest. And we keep
goin' until we can retire... or we get caught.

588
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,388
Either way, we're fixed for life.

589
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,675
Boys, it's a kind offer, but...

590
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,632
you're suggesting I just up and leave Ed.

591
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,474
And that'd be pretty
damn cowardly, wouldn't it?

592
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,074
Would it? Think about it, H I.

593
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,678
Seems to me sittin' here
you ain't doin' her any good.

594
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,752
And you ain't bein' true to your own nature.

595
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,835
<i>My dearest Edwina,</i>

596
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,034
<i>tonight, as you and Nathan slumber,
my heart is filled with anguish.</i>

597
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,511
<i>I hope that you will both understand, and
forgive me for what I have decided I must do.</i>

598
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,637
<i>By the time you read this, I will be gone.</i>

599
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,912
<i>I will never be the man that you want me to be.</i>

600
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,596
<i>The husband and father
that you and Nathan deserve.</i>

601
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,955
<i>Maybe it's my upbringing.</i>

602
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,917
<i>Maybe it's just that my genes got screwed up.</i>

603
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,551
<i>I don't know.</i>

604
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,471
<i>But the events of the last day
have showed amply</i>

605
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:48,519
<i>that I don't have the strength
of character to raise up a family</i>

606
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,195
<i>in the manner befitting a responsible adult.</i>

607
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,755
<i>I say all this to my shame.</i>

608
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,111
<i>I will love you always, truly and deeply.</i>

609
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:12,514
<i>But I fear that, if I stay,
I would only bring bad trouble</i>

610
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,797
<i>on the heads of you and Nathan Junior.</i>

611
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,038
<i>I feel the thunder gathering even now.</i>

612
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,917
<i>If I leave, hopefully,</i>

613
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,675
<i>it will leave with me.</i>

614
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,111
<i>I cannot tarry.</i>

615
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,271
<i>Better I should go, send you money
and let you curse my name.</i>

616
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,391
<i>Your loving -</i>

617
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,031
<i>Herbert.</i>

618
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,669
Mr Arizona, he just barged in.
Should I call Duane?

619
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,156
Hell, no. Why wake the security guard?

620
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,231
I'll take care of this.

621
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,239
- You got flies.
- I doubt it.

622
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,751
This place is climate-controlled.
All the windows are sealed.

623
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,393
- Who the hell are you?
- Smalls. Leonard Smalls.

624
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,070
My friends call me Lenny.
But I got no friends.

625
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,998
Stop. You're gonna make me bust out cryin'.

626
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,756
Listen, Leonard... you want some furniture
or a shit-box, they're on the sales floor.

627
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,071
I'm not a customer. I'm a manhunter.

628
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,915
Now, of course, I do hunt babies on occasion.

629
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,390
I hear you got one you can't put your hand to.

630
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,517
- What do you know about it?
- That's my business.

631
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,070
I'm a tracker, and some say part hound dog.

632
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,918
But when some dink busts outta the joint,
skips bail, I'm the one they call.

633
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,036
Mister...

634
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,319
I got the cops, state troopers,
Federal BI, already lookin' for my boy.

635
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,518
- Now if you got information...
- The cops won't find your boy.

636
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,876
A cop couldn't find his butt
if he had a bell on it.

637
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,475
You wanna find an outlaw,
you call an outlaw.

638
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,836
You wanna find a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop.

639
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,515
Smalls, first off,
get your damn feet off my furniture.

640
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,474
Second off, it's widely known
I posted a 25-grand reward for my boy.

641
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,154
Now if you can find him, claim it.

642
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,032
Short of that, what have we got to talk about?

643
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,194
Price. Fair price.

644
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,197
That's not what you say it is.
That's what the market will bear.

645
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,471
Simple economics.

646
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:03,556
Now there are people - and, mind you, I know
'em - that'll pay a lot more than $25,000

647
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,995
for a healthy baby.

648
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,390
- What are you after?
- I'll give you an idea.

649
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,430
As a pup, I myself fetched
$30,000 on the black market.

650
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,193
That was 1954 dollars.

651
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,068
Now, for 50 grand, I'll track him

652
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,992
and I'll find him.

653
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,590
And the people that took him...
I'll kick their butts.

654
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,432
No extra charge.

655
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,959
- And if I don't pay?
- I'll get the boy regardless.

656
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,752
And if you don't pay, the market will.

657
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,349
You wanna know what I think?

658
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,714
I think you're an evil man.

659
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,391
I think this is nothin' but a goddamn
screw job. I think it's a shakedown.

660
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,194
I think you're the one that took Nathan Junior

661
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,397
and I think you're the one
that's gonna get his butt kicked.

662
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,233
I think I'm on the phone
to the cops right now...

663
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,550
Up and at 'em, H I!
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.

664
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,553
Already you're messin' it up.
Missis gonna be back from town soon.

665
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,712
- Where's the baby?
- In the bedroom in his crib.

666
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,792
He's sawin' toothpicks. He'll be fine.

667
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,719
- You expectin' anyone?
- No.

668
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,475
You two stay outta sight.

669
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,032
- Mornin', Glen.
- I ain't comin' in, if you don't mind.

670
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,031
I'll just keep my distance.

671
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,032
- I didn't invite ya in, Glen.
- Don't even bother.

672
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:55,069
- First off, you're fired, and that's official.
- I kinda figured that, Glen.

673
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,958
Well, that ain't the reason
I come out here. No, sir!

674
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,430
No. You're in a whole
shitload of trouble, my friend.

675
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,513
- Why don't yajust calm down?
- Why don't you just make me?

676
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,958
You know that little baby you got in there?
Remember? I know what his real name is!

677
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:15,319
- You wanna keep your voice down, Glen?
- I'll pitch my voice wherever I please!

678
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:21,910
His name ain't Hi Junior, it ain't Ed Junior,
but it's Junior, all right. It's Nathan Junior!

679
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,468
You stay away from me, McDunnough!

680
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:31,556
Yeah. You're an awful big man when you
got somethin' around to clobber a guy with!

681
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,473
- I ain't a big man.
- That's right.

682
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,949
And now you're at my mercy.

683
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,556
I'm your worst nightmare.
I was gonna turn you in for the reward,

684
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,235
but Dot wants somethin' to cuddle.
I guess we'll be callin' the baby

685
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,629
Glen Junior from now on!

686
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,398
I'll give you a day to break the news to Ed!

687
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,354
Dot'll be around tomorrow to pick him up.

688
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,510
Either that, or you go to jail.

689
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,997
Say, that reminds me.

690
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:11,473
You'll be gettin' a doctor bill in the mail
in a few days. I recommend you pay it!

691
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,919
- What's goin' on here?
- It's just business.

692
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,195
This'll go hard or easy, H I.

693
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,029
Sweet Lord!

694
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,518
<i>' She'll be comin' round the mountain
when she comes</i>

695
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,079
<i>' Oh, when she comes</i>

696
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,232
<i>' She'll be comin' round the mountain
when she comes</i>

697
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,469
Good!

698
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,554
I know you're worried, but we're gonna get
him back. There ain't no question about that.

699
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,473
We will. That's all there is to it.
And another thing...

700
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,111
I'm gonna be a better person from here on
out. That's the way it's gonna be. It's official.

701
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,589
You were right. A blind man could tell ya that.

702
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,035
They won't hurt him.
They're in it for the score.

703
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,793
But I'm a changed man.
You were right, I was wrong.

704
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,713
We got a family here.
I'm gonna start actin' responsibly.

705
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,917
So let's go, honey.
Let's go get Nathan Junior!

706
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,159
<i>' All have chicken and dumplings</i>

707
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,994
<i>' Yeah, we'll all have chicken
and dumplings when she comes</i>

708
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,551
I lurve to drive.

709
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,709
- Boy, you sure said somethin' there, partner.
- Yes, sir.

710
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,997
I figure between the ransom and this bank,

711
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,069
you and I'll be sittin'
in the fabled catbird seat.

712
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,871
Gale...

713
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,920
Junior just had an accident.

714
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,876
- What's that, partner?
- He had hisself a little ol' accident.

715
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,238
- What do you mean? He looks OK.
- No, you see, movin' though we are,

716
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,790
he just went and had hisself
a little old rest dump.

717
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,751
Well, that's natural.

718
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,871
- Gale?
- What now, little brother?

719
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,271
He smiled at me.

720
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,112
The kid smiled at me.

721
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,395
Come here, boy. Nice.

722
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:21,319
- Do you know how to put these things on?
- Around the butt and up over the groin area.

723
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,596
Shoot, I know where they go, old-timer. I just
wanna know whether I need pins or fasteners.

724
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:33,028
Well, no. They got tapettes already on there.
It's self-contained and fairly explanatory.

725
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,271
Balloons. Hey, these blow up
into funny shapes at all?

726
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,430
Well, no, unless round is funny.

727
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,791
I'll take these too.

728
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,672
All right, now...

729
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,399
Now you just lie down back there, old-timer.

730
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,152
Yes, sir.

731
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,552
All right, I want you to count up to... 825

732
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,438
- and then on back down to zero.
- OK, then.

733
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,229
I'm gonna come back in five
and check to see you ain't cheatin'.

734
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,875
- Hurry up!
- He's a cheerful little critter

735
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,669
- once he warms up to you.
- I don't know how high this one can count.

736
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,513
Six Mississippi, seven Mississippi,

737
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,273
eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi...

738
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,238
Got some baby grub, baby wipes,

739
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,835
got them diapers, them disposable kind.
I got me a packet of balloons.

740
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,196
- They blow up into funny shapes at all?
- No, just circular.

741
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,669
Say... where's Junior?

742
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,631
- What do you mean? Didn't you put him in?
- No, I thought...

743
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,071
Where'd we leave him?

744
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,272
No!

745
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,710
801 Mississippi, 800 Mississippi...

746
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,751
Junior!

747
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,995
791... Bullshit!

748
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,274
790 Mississippi...

749
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,393
- 787 Mississippi...
- Baby! Baby!

750
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,869
Baby! Baby!

751
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,474
Promise we ain't ever gonna leave him, Gale.

752
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:09,236
- Promise we ain't never gonna give him up.
- We ain't gonna give him up again, Evelle.

753
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,470
He's our little Gale Junior now.

754
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,151
Ed...

755
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:36,074
I realise I can't be much
of a comfort to you now.

756
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,675
But let me just say this:

757
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,597
- You'll feel a whole lot better...
- I don't wanna feel better.

758
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,990
- Honey...
- I don't care about myself any more.

759
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,117
I don't care about us any more.

760
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,998
- I just want Nathan Junior back safe.
- I know that.

761
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,311
If we don't get him back safe,
I don't wanna go on livin'.

762
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,235
And even if we do get him back safe,
I don't wanna go on livin' with you.

763
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,188
I guess I still love you, Hi.

764
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,475
I... I know I do.

765
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,957
I ain't even blamin' you.

766
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,555
The whole thing was crazy
and the whole thing was my idea.

767
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,236
- Well, factually, I myself bear a very large...
- Let me finish.

768
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:34,552
Ever since those jailbirds took little Nathan,
I been thinkin' and I ain't too proud of myself.

769
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,633
Even if Mrs Arizona had
more than she could handle,

770
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:45,078
I was a police officer, sworn to uphold
the Constitution of the United States.

771
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,312
- Now, honey, you resigned before we ever...
- That ain't the point, Hi.

772
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:53,712
We don't deserve Nathan Junior
any more than those jailbirds do.

773
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,872
- If I'm as selfish and irresponsible as you...
- You're not that bad.

774
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,430
If I'm as bad as you,
what good are we to each other?

775
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,034
You and me is just a fool's paradise.

776
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,631
- There she is.
- Yep.

777
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,315
Well... let's do her.

778
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,437
- What are we gonna do with Gale Junior?
- He stays here.

779
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,593
Are you crazy? Supposin' we go
in there and get ourselves killed.

780
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,558
It'd be hours before he was discovered.

781
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,514
All right, you hayseeds, it's a stick-up!

782
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,990
Everybody freeze!
Everybody down on the ground!

783
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,510
Well, which is it, young feller?

784
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,672
You want I should freeze
or get down on the ground?

785
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,799
I mean to say, if I freeze, I can't rightly drop

786
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,993
and, if I drop,
I'm gonna be in motion. You see?

787
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,435
- Shut up!
- OK, then.

788
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,115
- Everybody down on the ground!
- You can forget that part about freezin'.

789
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,670
- That is till they get down there.
- Y'all hear that, don't ya?

790
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,150
You wanna fill this up, partner? We gotta...

791
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,515
Shit! Where did all the tellers go?

792
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,591
We're down here, sir.

793
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:57,070
They're over there on the ground
like you commanded, Gale.

794
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,355
I told you not to use my damn name.

795
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,637
Can't you even try
to keep from forgettin' that?

796
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,671
Not even your code name?

797
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,468
Oh, yeah, yeah. My code name.

798
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,393
Y'all hear that? We're usin' code names.

799
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,916
All right, everybody. We're about
ready to begin the robbery proper.

800
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,236
Hurry up, you dang hayseed!

801
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,790
All right, now y'all know how this here works.

802
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,317
That hayseed over there
with the red hat, he's the monitor.

803
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,391
OK, you betcha.

804
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,629
I want you to stay flat for ten full minutes.

805
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:44,032
We mightjust come back in five to check.
That's for us to know and for y'all to find out.

806
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,715
Anyone found bipedal in five
wears his ass for a hat.

807
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,231
That old-timer threw off my concentration.
Otherwise it would have gone smoother.

808
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,269
Shoot, Gale. We done good.
This oughta split up real nice three ways.

809
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,190
Goddammit, you never leave a man behind!

810
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,436
- Where's the baby?
- Where's the baby?

811
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,273
Dammit, H I, ain't we got
enough to contend with?

812
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:48,559
I don't know, ma'am. I thought we left him
up on the roof. I think we left him at the bank.

813
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,234
Ms McDunnough, I'm worried sick about him!

814
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,073
- Hold on, H I.
- I'm worried sick about him!

815
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,355
- Hi!
- H I!

816
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,078
- Hi!
- Ms McDunnough!

817
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,196
- Let us come with you!
- Please!

818
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,350
He's our baby too!

819
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,631
- What is he?
- Do you see him too?

820
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,788
Gimme that baby!

821
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,998
I want that baby!

822
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,789
Gimme that baby, you warthog from hell!

823
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,234
Just lay down on the floor, young missy.

824
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,155
- Run along now, honey.
- But Hi...

825
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,830
Just run along now.

826
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,751
I... I didn't...

827
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,638
I'm sorry.

828
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,475
What the hell's goin' on?

829
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,475
Get away from there!

830
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:08,756
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute. I ain't through with you.

831
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,434
What are you doin'
creepin' around in the dark?

832
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,080
- You in with Smalls?
- Excuse me?

833
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,277
Leonard Smalls. Big feller. Rides a Harley.

834
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,475
Dresses like a rock star.

835
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,716
No, sir. That's who we saved him from.

836
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,038
- It's a long story.
- Suppose you tell it.

837
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:35,877
Well, sir, in a reward situation,
they usually say "no questions asked".

838
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,594
- Do they?
- Yeah.

839
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,271
Well...

840
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,711
All right, boy.

841
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,909
I guess you got a reward comin'.

842
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,431
$25,000.

843
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:04,509
Or, if you need home furnishings, I can
give you a line of credit at any of my stores.

844
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,637
In fact, that's the way
I'd rather handle it, for tax reasons.

845
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:11,269
We don't want no reward.
We didn't bring him back for money.

846
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,555
We could work it that way too.

847
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,749
Could I just look at him a little bit more?

848
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,710
Be my guest, little lady.

849
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,431
But...

850
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,752
Would you mind tellin' me exactly how you...

851
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,550
You took him, didn't you?

852
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,035
It wasn't that biker at all.

853
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,590
I took him, sir.
My wife had nothin' to do with it.

854
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,831
- I crept in yon window and...
- We both did it.

855
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,356
We didn't wanna hurt him any.
I just wanted to be a mama.

856
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,191
It wasn't for money or nothin'.

857
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,477
We just figured you had more
than you could handle baby-wise.

858
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,838
But I'm the one committed the actual crime,
so if you need to call the authorities...

859
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,435
Shut up. Nobody's gonna call
the authorities if there's no harm done.

860
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,795
- Thank you, sir.
- Aw, bullshit.

861
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,715
Just tell me why you did it.

862
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,351
We...

863
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,435
can't have one of our own.

864
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,075
Well, look...

865
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,110
If you can't have kids,
you just gotta keep tryin'

866
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,990
and hope medical science catches
up with you, like Florence and me.

867
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,955
It caught up with a vengeance.

868
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:46,511
But, hell, even if it never does for you,
you still got each other.

869
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,793
Sir, those are kind words, but...

870
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,870
I think the wife and I are splittin' up.

871
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:01,150
Her point is that we're both
kinda selfish and unrealistic,

872
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,672
so we ain't too good for each other.

873
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,993
Well, ma'am, I don't know much,
but I do know human beings.

874
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:17,072
You brought back my boy,
so you must have your good points too.

875
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,672
I sure hate to think of Florence leavin' me.

876
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,669
I do... love her so.

877
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,674
You can go out the way you came in.

878
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,995
And before you go off and do
another foolish thing, like bustin' up,

879
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,275
I suggest you sleep on it.

880
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,159
At least one night.

881
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,315
<i>That night I had a dream.</i>

882
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,038
<i>I dreamt I was as light as the ether,</i>

883
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,557
<i>a floatin'spirit, visitin' things to come.</i>

884
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:12,557
<i>The shades and shadows of the people
in my life wrestled their way into my slumber.</i>

885
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:20,430
<i>I dreamt that Gale and Evelle had decided to
return to prison. Probably that's just as well.</i>

886
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:25,310
<i>I don't mean to sound superior,
and they're a swell coupla guys,</i>

887
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:30,113
<i>but maybe they weren't ready yet
to come out into the world.</i>

888
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,508
<i>And then I dreamed on, into the future,</i>

889
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:42,829
<i>to a Christmas morning in the Arizona home,
where Nathan Junior was openin'a present</i>

890
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:46,913
<i>from a kindly couple
who preferred to remain unknown.</i>

891
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,193
<i>I saw Glen a few years later,</i>

892
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:57,354
<i>still havin'no luck gettin' the cops
to listen to his wild tales about me and Ed.</i>

893
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,313
<i>Maybe he threw in one Polack joke too many.</i>

894
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,839
<i>I don't know.</i>

895
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,990
<i>But still I dreamed on,</i>

896
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,799
<i>further into the future
than I'd ever dreamed before.</i>

897
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,237
<i>Watchin' Nathan Junior's progress from afar,</i>

898
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:24,155
<i>takin' pride in his accomplishments,
as if he were our own,</i>

899
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,318
<i>wonderin' if he ever thought of us,</i>

900
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,831
<i>and hopin' that maybe we'd
broadened his horizons a little,</i>

901
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,072
<i>even if he couldn't remember
just how they got broadened.</i>

902
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:43,798
<i>But still I hadn't dreamt
nothin' about me and Ed,</i>

903
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,871
<i>until the end.</i>

904
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,075
<i>And this was cloudier,</i>

905
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:52,948
<i>because it was years, years away.</i>

906
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:59,552
<i>But I saw an old couple
bein' visited by their children</i>

907
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,279
<i>and all their grandchildren too.</i>

908
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:09,196
<i>The old couple weren't screwed up,
and neither were their kids or their grandkids.</i>

909
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,478
Dad...

910
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,551
<i>And I don't know.</i>

911
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,157
<i>You tell me.</i>

912
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,231
<i>This whole dream.</i>

913
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,231
<i>Was it wishful thinkin'?</i>

914
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,914
<i>Was I just fleein'reality,
like I know I'm liable to do?</i>

915
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,712
<i>But me and Ed, we can be good too.</i>

916
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,311
<i>And it seemed real.</i>

917
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,751
<i>It seemed like us.</i>

918
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,231
<i>And it seemed like,</i>

919
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,349
<i>well... our home.</i>

920
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,871
<i>If not Arizona, then a land not too far away,</i>

921
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,188
<i>where all parents are
strong and wise and capable</i>

922
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,677
<i>and all the children are happy and beloved.</i>

923
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,351
<i>I don't know.</i>

924
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,195
<i>Maybe it was Utah.</i>

925
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,675
