1
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
Come on, can we finish this?
It's getting late.

2
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,438
Yeah, okay.

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,351
I assure my esteemed colleague...

4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,672
that since the death of our mutual friend
and coworker Samuel Norman...

5
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,069
the Auto Workers Alliance has made
a substantial recovery and will continue...

6
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,957
No, new sentence there.

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,153
Okay. We will continue to improve with
the months ahead. Yours truly, Frank...

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,832
I know who it's from, Frank.

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,794
You hear that?

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,311
It's probably my date.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,872
Come on, Liz.

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,834
Come on.

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,277
Don't be in such a hurry to get home.

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,238
You can't possibly have
a better suggestion.

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,355
So happens I do!

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,394
Oh, Frank!

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,955
Boy, I'll tell you, these things never work.

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,316
What? You got something
against violence?

19
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,559
You dating Santa Claus?

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,233
Jesus Christ!

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,553
Jesus Christ!

22
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,468
Hey, man!

23
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,595
No, man!

24
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,673
It was a regular fuck-a-rama
at my place last night.

25
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,951
Can the shit, Kornblau.

26
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,755
There ain't been any pussy at your pad
since your mother helped you move in.

27
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,634
They ought to call your place
"The House of Whacks."

28
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,555
Check this out.

29
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,311
I'm surprised he don't wear
a shirt that says "I steal shit" on it.

30
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,589
What's he think
we're driving an ice cream truck?

31
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,954
He's gotta be kidding.

32
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,668
This boy would have to go to college for
four years...

33
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,955
just to reach the level of shit-for-brains.

34
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,155
There he goes!

35
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,110
You little bastard!
What's wrong with you?

36
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,152
We better call the meat wagon.

37
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,355
It'd be best to let it percolate a little.

38
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,999
Give me your damn purse!

39
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,596
I'll give you my purse
where it'll do you the most good!

40
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,514
What's your name?

41
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,518
Albert Smith.

42
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,439
Your mother and father weren't, by any
chance, brother and sister, were they?

43
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,553
- What's gonna happen to me?
- Nothing.

44
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,033
Nothing much. You might have to endure
a little session with "Action" Jackson.

45
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,272
- Who's Actson...
- Action.

46
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,837
Action Jackson.

47
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,837
Some say he didn't even have a mother.

48
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,592
That some researchers at NASA...

49
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,190
created him to be the first man to walk
on the moon without a space suit.

50
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,188
Others say his mother
was molested by Bigfoot.

51
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,271
And Jackson's their mutant offspring.

52
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,148
They bring in Jackson when they want
to re-educate some young ne'er-do-well.

53
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,430
Such as yourself, Albert.

54
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,075
I remember one kid got
re-educated so bad...

55
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,948
his testicles climbed back up
into his belly. Wouldn't come out.

56
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,076
They called it a medical miracle.

57
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,072
Another kid handcuffed to a chair.

58
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,637
Gnawed his own hand off like a trapped
skunk or wolverine or something.

59
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,792
Jackson is so vicious,
we don't even let him have a gun.

60
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,035
Is he here?

61
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,679
Sometimes he gets so riled up...

62
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,070
you gotta use tranquilizer darts
just to keep him in his chair.

63
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,678
Hey, how you doing man?

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,718
Hey, what's going on?

65
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,713
Where is he?

66
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,398
Keep your dick on, kid.

67
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,188
They're probably
just cleaning out his cage.

68
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,069
Hi, darling.

69
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,630
How much do you charge for a hand job?

70
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,910
My partner has sprained his wrist.

71
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,395
Maybe you'd like to try a foot job instead?

72
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,995
How much is that?

73
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,471
For you, it's free.

74
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,789
Stop that kid!

75
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,038
Stupid son of a bitch!

76
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,551
Little shit! I'm gonna break your legs!

77
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,709
Grab him!

78
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,309
- Get that little shit!
- Look out!

79
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,589
Mellow out.

80
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,876
You did it again, Jackson.

81
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,676
Jackson, what's on the agenda today?

82
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,594
Trying out a new typewriter or maybe
a dangerous Xerox assignment?

83
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,432
I'm sorry! I meant to congratulate
you on that collar you made.

84
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,033
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.

85
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,829
It takes sharp police work to track a man
screaming, "I did it! I did it!"

86
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,078
You know, Jackson, I can't believe
we stayed partners as long as we did.

87
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,235
- Come in!
- Somebody had to carry you.

88
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,357
File that, will you? So far we got zilch.

89
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,830
It's as if the assailant was invisible.

90
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,673
There wasn't enough left of Stringer
for an autopsy.

91
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,668
And his secretary, Miss Massetori,
seems to have died before the fire started.

92
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,309
How was that?

93
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,914
No sign of smoke inhalation.
Not even seared lungs.

94
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,109
Interesting.

95
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,988
It was unusual for Mr. Stringer and
Miss Massetori to be working so late...

96
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,553
but the coroner didn't seem to think
he was slipping her the old protein pickup.

97
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,593
Detective Kotterwell,
please keep a leash on your vocabulary.

98
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,513
Yes, sir.

99
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,559
Like me to repeat anything?

100
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,676
"The old protein pickup."

101
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,035
You give this department class.
I'm surprised they don't make you captain.

102
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,795
If Armbruster fucked up as bad
as you did, they probably would.

103
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,431
Looks like your friend fainted again.

104
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,478
Did you threaten to white him out?

105
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,393
No, I just showed him
a picture of your girlfriend.

106
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,639
Jackson, have a seat.

107
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,030
Sergeant, how long has it been
since you lost your lieutenant's stripes?

108
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,709
Almost two years.

109
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,995
And how would you describe
those two years?

110
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,314
Uneventful.

111
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,558
Jackson, in my years on the force, I have
never met a more dedicated policeman.

112
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,037
I know you're a very proud man.
And you have much to be proud of.

113
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,313
High-school track star,
Harvard law degree.

114
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,109
Frankly, if I had a Harvard law degree
I never would've become a policeman.

115
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,071
I know the duties I assign you
are trivial, but they're crucial...

116
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,390
in maintaining the goodwill of the public.

117
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,317
- Yes, sir.
- Like tonight.

118
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,916
I need you to represent the department
at the Detroit Businessman League's ...

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,549
Man of the Year fundraiser.
I was scheduled to attend...

120
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,111
but I had forgotten that this
is my wife's Parcheesi night.

121
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,312
- That sounds pretty painless.
- Won't be that painless.

122
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,670
Their Man of the Year is Peter Dellaplane.

123
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,271
Peter Dellaplane is Man of the Year?

124
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,271
Sure. Why not make Charlie Manson
a high-school guidance counselor?

125
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,874
Just because the man had a few
family problems...

126
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,475
His son's a sexual psychopath.
With problems like that, I'd get neutered.

127
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,710
I know you take this matter
very personally...

128
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,473
Personally?
Captain, the man cost me my stripes!

129
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,233
No, Jackson.
You cost you your stripes, no one else!

130
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,954
You could've handled
Sean Dellaplane more delicately.

131
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,429
How? Send him an engraved invitation?

132
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,671
"Come on down here.
Join us at city jail. Dress casual. RSVP."

133
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,273
You nearly tore that boy's arm off!

134
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,999
So? He had a spare.

135
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,318
Sergeant, I'm not sure
I'm getting through to you.

136
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,757
That case not only cost you
your lieutenant's stripes...

137
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,752
but also your gun permit and marriage...

138
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,389
and brought this department the kind of
publicity we can gladly do without.

139
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,110
The public doesn't appreciate charges
of police brutality, substantiated or not!

140
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,835
I'm not asking you to go there
to brownnose Peter Dellaplane.

141
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,998
I just need to be sure your
Action Jackson days are far behind you.

142
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,595
Then we can see about
getting those lieutenant's stripes back.

143
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,549
On television I came across a commercial
for Dellaplane's car, the Halley.

144
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,719
And I was struck
by just how apt that name is.

145
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,954
For Peter Dellaplane is himself a comet.

146
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,796
A man whose bright and blazing tail
leads the way...

147
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,075
for few with the courage to follow.

148
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,752
And like Halley's comet,
he's the kind of man...

149
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,912
who comes along only once in a lifetime.

150
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,991
Ladies and gentlemen, our Man of the Year
Mr. Peter Anthony Dellaplane.

151
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,115
Thank you.

152
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,349
Congratulations!

153
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,918
Wonderful, Peter!

154
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,869
Thank you.

155
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,514
I hope the fire marshal
isn't too alarmed by my blazing tail.

156
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,630
As a young boy growing up
in my father's house...

157
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,790
I spent a lot of time in the library.

158
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,509
One not that much smaller
than the Library of Congress.

159
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,473
Pardon me.

160
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,870
You can't hear what he's saying here.

161
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,996
I know. It's the best seat in the house.

162
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,234
I take it your not
one of Mr. Dellaplane's friends.

163
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,031
Not unless they changed the definition.

164
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,113
I want you to meet,
my most lovely bride...

165
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,596
Patrice Dellaplane.

166
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,749
Patrice!

167
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,111
I bet I can make you change your mind.

168
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,391
My most precious wife.

169
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,992
Sweetheart,
let's share this moment together.

170
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,679
Yes, didn't Caulfield versus North Carolina
demonstrate...

171
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,639
that liability applies to government
as individuals, not as a unit?

172
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,235
No, liability applies only if
the individual's acting on his own accord...

173
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,788
not as a representative
of the governing body.

174
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,996
Yes, I see that. But on the other hand...

175
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,470
What do you think of our Man of the Year?

176
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,079
I think he is a greedy, conceited,
two-faced, backstabbing asshole.

177
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,879
Yes, I'd say that just about sums it up.

178
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,716
Peter, I'd like you to meet...
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

179
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,677
Jackson. Jericho Jackson.

180
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,674
There's a nickname
associated with it, isn't there?

181
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,469
Something like "excitement"?
"Enthusiasm"? "Esprit de corps"?

182
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,675
It's "Action."

183
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,637
Of course. That rhymes.

184
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,237
How do you two know each other?

185
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,151
We met through my son.

186
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,834
I helped him to relocate.
How's he doing, by the way?

187
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,679
He's adjusting. The Dellaplanes are
always adept at dealing with obstacles.

188
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,230
He was always a popular boy. I'm sure
he's very popular in his new home.

189
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,356
I hear all it takes is the right opening.

190
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,668
The car's ready, sir.

191
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,194
It's been a pleasure
to see you again, Lieutenant.

192
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,672
I'm sorry. It's sergeant now, isn't it?

193
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,476
Guess I haven't been able
to make you change your mind after all.

194
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,754
What do you call a guy with
no arms and legs, under a pile of leaves?

195
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,759
Russell.

196
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,435
A guy with no arms and legs,
who sits on the porch?

197
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,119
Matt.

198
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,029
A guy with no arms and legs,
who sits on the wall?

199
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,475
Art.

200
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,434
Pal, you're trying to unload
a whole field of fertilizer on me here.

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,630
Stringer's death
was neither tragic nor accidental.

202
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,519
Somebody diced the guy.

203
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
A guy with no arms and legs
that floats in the water?

204
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,232
You two assholes
if you don't shut the fuck up!

205
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,829
Bob.

206
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,789
What's up his ass?

207
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,037
I have some Tums, if you need them.

208
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,189
What the...

209
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,915
Yeah, Ray, you're talking
to Mr. Security himself here.

210
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,800
I got the place tighter
than the Pope's poop chute.

211
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,438
What going on down there?

212
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,117
Yeah, I know,
but you're interrupting an aria.

213
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,874
Okay. Yeah.

214
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,748
Good night.

215
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,559
Later!

216
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,679
You better start thinking
about a new career, pal.

217
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,274
Oh, shit!

218
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,512
Hey, Sarge! Good evening.
Too bad about the game?

219
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,312
We lost. Damn!

220
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,510
- Put money down on it?
- Clovis, I'm a cop.

221
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,551
How much did you lose on that game?

222
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,717
Okay, $10.

223
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,156
Is that all? Do they give you enough?
You gotta play for higher stakes!

224
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,037
That means I'd have to tip less.

225
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,839
Stop the presses!
You did not hear it from this mouth.

226
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,194
Please be careful...

227
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,273
With the car because the parts are hard
to find for a '66 Impala. Yeah, I know.

228
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,112
I really don't sound that bad, do I?

229
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,998
No, I was merely extemporizing.

230
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,114
Extemporizing.

231
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,317
Clovis, please don't peel away
too slowly because...

232
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,231
this car's my most prized possession...

233
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,039
and should be driven
as fast as possible always.

234
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,596
This has nothing to do with plumbing.

235
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,429
Well, of course it doesn't.
Don't be ridiculous!

236
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,553
The Halley, from Dellaplane.
Look for a new star in the sky tonight.

237
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,874
The Halley.
The car of tomorrow can be yours today.

238
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,714
Hot.... Hotter.... Hottest.

239
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,149
We're miles above the rest.
The Halley, from Dellaplane.

240
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,589
Jericho, this is Tony.
Pick up, man. You there?

241
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,474
I got some news, pal.
Some interesting stuff.

242
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,558
Call me.
You know where you can reach me.

243
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,475
Harbor officials report
that the craft belongs to Lionel Grantham.

244
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,554
An AWA official who's been President
of Local 132 for the last five years.

245
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,234
Grantham is believed to have died
in the explosion...

246
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,914
with three crew members
whose names are being held....

247
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,956
Come on. There's gotta be more!

248
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,191
The coroner's looking at
what's left of Grantham.

249
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,034
It's like the Norman case. There wasn't
enough left to spit on a pizza.

250
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,032
- What evidence connects the deaths?
- Am I hearing correctly?

251
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,317
Is the one-man army
really asking for help?

252
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,391
- Jackson, call for you!
- Who is it?

253
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,879
Do I look like your secretary?

254
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,793
Yeah, it must be your lipstick.
Hold on a second. Dale!

255
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,752
- Jackson here.
- It's Tony.

256
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,798
- Tony, I'm sorry. I...
- Where the hell have you been?

257
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,509
Come to my apartment soon as you can.
This is a matter of life and death.

258
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,873
Hey, Tony?

259
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,756
Jesus, Tony. You don't look too good.

260
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,677
How'd you get in here?

261
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,873
It was open.

262
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,755
What the hell happened here?
Who did this?

263
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,869
I did.

264
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,676
You can never be too careful.

265
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,115
The walls have ears, and all of that.

266
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,111
Come on, I wanna take you to a hospital.

267
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,315
No.

268
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,475
Sit down.

269
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,630
You sit down and you're gonna listen.

270
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,909
All right. Just cool it.

271
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,637
You look like you haven't slept in days.

272
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,676
I can't afford to sleep.

273
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,919
Norman dead. Grantham dead.
Stringer dead.

274
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,435
And Tony alive for now.

275
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,150
- Right?
- Who'd wanna kill you, Tony?

276
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,069
I'll give you three guesses, and
the first two you forget about. All right?

277
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,278
Here's a little hint:

278
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,989
"Hot. Hotter. Hottest."

279
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,719
Peter Dellaplane.

280
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,957
I'd like to tell you a story

281
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,872
About a man
and the many hearts he broke

282
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,555
Eye to eye you are no match
'Cause you wanna fall in love

283
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,432
Girls, he'll break your heart
Do you wrong, tell you lies

284
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,589
'Cause he's got those far away eyes

285
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,669
Far away eyes

286
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,515
I'm a fool, baby

287
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,510
Far away eyes

288
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,954
Boy, you're a heartbreaker

289
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,634
Still, I've got to make you mine

290
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,280
Play on this, baby

291
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,635
You're the one and only
Open up my door

292
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,675
And love me with your far away eyes

293
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,229
Far away eyes

294
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,869
How do you feel, baby

295
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,917
Far away eyes

296
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,109
Boy, you're a heartbreaker

297
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,193
Still, I've got to make you mine

298
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,111
I expected a standing ovation.

299
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,234
You're getting one.

300
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,512
- Will you be leaving now, Miss Ash?
- Yes, she will, Edd.

301
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,311
Would you like me to accompany you?

302
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,789
No, thank you.
This part I can do on my own.

303
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,758
You remember who pays your salary
don't you?

304
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,952
Yes, sir. You do, Mr. Dellaplane.
And most generously.

305
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,909
Right.

306
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,877
Working for Springer,
my job was to keep tabs on people.

307
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,989
Ask questions, find out who's planning
what power plays. That kind of thing.

308
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,631
Dellaplane, was working his way
through the union.

309
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,556
Finding out who's for him, who against.

310
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,997
Who resented his money, his power.
Who was agreeing with him and all that.

311
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,433
All right, look.

312
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,436
What does that have to do with Stringer?

313
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,878
Stringer didn't trust him.
He hated his guts, in fact.

314
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,879
That's the same
for Norman and for Grantham.

315
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,757
And because of that Dellaplane
wanted them out of the way.

316
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,354
For what?

317
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,674
That's the rickety part,
because I don't know.

318
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,510
It's just... I mean, I can't figure that out.

319
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,716
Wait. Come on, think about it.

320
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,555
You're saying that Dellaplane's
killing off unfriendly AWA leaders...

321
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,632
and you don't know why
and you don't have any evidence.

322
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,280
Don't tell me you're afraid of Dellaplane.

323
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,994
The Jackson I used to know
wasn't afraid of nothing.

324
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,753
We all thought he'd make
a name for himself.

325
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,949
If I got the wrong Jackson, please tell me.

326
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,031
Come on, you got the right Jackson.

327
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,710
Just that he didn't make the name
for himself that he thought he would.

328
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,598
One person you might try
is Dellaplane's mistress.

329
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,749
She's a singer.

330
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,631
Her name is Sydney Ash
and she works at this club.

331
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,757
Joey's Club Elite. All right?

332
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,390
- I'm not wasting your time.
- I know.

333
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,471
I promise you that I'm on to something.

334
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,115
Thanks.

335
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,314
Moretti?

336
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,509
Delivery.

337
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,038
Would you please sign here?

338
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,428
It's C.O.D.

339
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,995
I saw your wife in the paper last week.

340
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,557
Are you ever gonna tell her about me?

341
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,877
Why would I do a thing like that?

342
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,870
You know I never mix
business with pleasure.

343
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,148
Which of us is business
and which is pleasure?

344
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,710
Would you like me to spell it out for you?

345
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,836
You said that you'd come see me more.

346
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,312
And you said a man from Motown
was gonna come hear me sing.

347
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,037
And you also said that I could
cut a record and that I'd be going places.

348
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,989
Did I say all that?

349
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,276
Really?

350
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,233
Give me two good reasons
why I'd say all those things.

351
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,833
Now I remember.

352
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,795
Oh, baby!

353
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,908
You're gorgeous.

354
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,798
This is supposed to be a girl's best friend.

355
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,156
What would I ever do without you?

356
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,836
Let's hope you never have to find out.

357
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,349
Sweet dreams, baby.

358
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,639
Amphetamines, malnutrition, insomnia.

359
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,795
If the bullet hadn't gotten him,
he would've dropped dead within a week.

360
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,793
That's very consoling.
You got a great bedside manner.

361
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,429
In this business, I need a bedside manner
like I need another nose.

362
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,919
He's a friend of yours?

363
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,317
From the same high school.
We were on the track team together.

364
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,078
He was a real high-strung kid.

365
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,671
I hadn't seen much of him
since he started to work for the union.

366
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,871
Kotterwell says it's suicide.

367
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,635
He wouldn't know suicide
if it crawled up his ass and died there.

368
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,600
They said Tony killed himself
with a 9mm. Bullshit!

369
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,997
I saw him packing a 32.
Somebody planted that 9mm on him.

370
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,229
You got any leads?

371
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,032
I know a woman who might help,
but I gotta get her away from her husband.

372
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,959
Story of my life!

373
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,555
All right. If I see a cake with 63
candles, I'll be out the door faster than...

374
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,552
shit through Secretariat.

375
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,191
This should go well with your meal.

376
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,112
I didn't know you listed photography
among your other interests.

377
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,713
Is that all you have to say?

378
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,871
The negative's quite poor, isn't it?

379
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,075
The quality of the print seems excellent.

380
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,228
It's a shame
the subject wasn't more cooperative.

381
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,796
- Who was he?
- His name was Tony Moretti.

382
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,074
He worked for Frank Stringer.

383
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,197
They both knew your plans for the AWA.
and now they're dead.

384
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,713
Is that clear enough?

385
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,075
Exactly what are you planning
for the AWA?

386
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,032
Ray, I'm sorry. My manners are....

387
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,919
Sweetheart.

388
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,669
Ray, this is Sergeant Jericho Jackson,
one of Detroit's finest.

389
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,116
This is Raymond Foss,
President of the Auto Workers Alliance.

390
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,114
I'm sure he would be delighted
to hear exactly what it is I have planned.

391
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,430
- Good afternoon, Mr. Foss.
- Sergeant.

392
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,597
Too bad you couldn't find
a more suitable luncheon companion.

393
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,400
Mrs. Dellaplane,
I hope you'll forgive the intrusion.

394
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,034
Good day.

395
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,833
Is he giving you trouble?

396
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,312
His kind of trouble is no trouble at all.

397
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,989
Lesson's over. Show him to his car.

398
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,309
Yes, sir.

399
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,189
We're having some problems
with O'R ooney...

400
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,919
but we should have him in shape
by this Sunday.

401
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,150
Jackson got to Moretti before we did.

402
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,272
It doesn't matter. What could he tell him?
He had no proof.

403
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,515
Jackson? No need to.
He doesn't know enough....

404
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,999
I say that sounds fine.
I believe we can meet that.

405
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,235
- Peter.
- Just a sec.

406
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,594
I need to talk to you.

407
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,355
I got a meeting in 14 minutes. I'm on the
phone with my Italian distributor...

408
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,317
it costs more than your diamond brooch.

409
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,238
- It's important.
- This is important.

410
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,550
I say we can meet that. Let's go, please.

411
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,075
It'll just take a second, honey...

412
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,955
It'll be here by about a couple of weeks,
I think.

413
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,637
Will you be leaving, madam?
I'll be happy to drive you.

414
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,870
No, thank you. I can do it myself.

415
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,159
- Sergeant!
- I was just coming to see you.

416
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,630
- Are you going into town?
- Yeah, would you like a ride?

417
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,392
I thought you'd never ask.

418
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,432
I couldn't figure out
what they were talking about...

419
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,956
but I heard him say the name Moretti.
And he definitely said your name.

420
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,869
He also said something about
a man named O'R ooney.

421
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,873
How they were having trouble with him,
but they'd have him in shape by Sunday.

422
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,190
That's gotta be Oliver O'R ooney.

423
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,229
He worked for your husband a long time
ago, but now I think he's with the AWA.

424
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,675
- You familiar with the name?
- No.

425
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,672
What do you know about
Frank Stringer or Lionel Grantham?

426
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,318
Only what I read in the paper.

427
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,959
Peter never mentioned either of them.
He doesn't bring his work home with him.

428
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,155
Except this weekend. He's giving a party
for that man we had lunch with.

429
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,273
Raymond Foss?
Aren't he and your husband friends?

430
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,959
No, not at all.

431
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,514
In fact, I could've sworn
they hated each other.

432
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,397
He's gotta be used to that by now.

433
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,518
I know how you feel about Peter.
But you don't know him the way I do.

434
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,190
He may seem greedy and arrogant
to most people...

435
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,829
but you don't make it big in the industry
and remained loved by everyone.

436
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,879
I met him after his first wife died
and his son went to prison.

437
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,636
I think the whole experience changed him.

438
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,790
He's not the man you think you know.

439
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,517
What do you think you know about me?

440
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,150
I think you're not so different from Peter.

441
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,597
You're both stubborn.
Both intent on getting what you want.

442
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,519
You know,
I think Peter admires you a little bit.

443
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,076
Not many people have caused him
so much trouble and got away with it.

444
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,356
Who says I've gotten away with anything?

445
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,277
Come on. Let's get out of here.

446
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,629
Can you get me to the party?

447
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,199
Not and keep my marriage.

448
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,316
I cut a fine figure on the dance floor.

449
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,272
At least I would, if your husband
didn't have my legs broken.

450
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,272
Why do they call you Action...

451
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,199
Are you okay?

452
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,829
Go to the police station.
I have to catch a cab.

453
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,034
Hey you, I'm talking to you.

454
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,993
Come on, asshole!

455
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,999
Now I got you!

456
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,389
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

457
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,629
Shit!

458
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,795
Oh, shit!

459
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,988
Enough is enough!

460
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,390
You want to shoot me?
I'm not packing. Don't shoot me!

461
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,393
Come on and get me!
Don't shoot me. That's too easy.

462
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,436
Be a man! Come and get me!

463
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,911
I know you killed Tony!
Come on, chicken shit!

464
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,274
Come on!

465
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,871
Son of a bitch! Shit.

466
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,748
Where did he go?

467
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,354
I'm afraid to ask.

468
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,354
Dry cleaning.

469
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,991
- There's a Ray Foss on the line for you.
- I'll take it in my office.

470
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,832
It's the Martinizing that does it.

471
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,793
Is there a woman who came by for me?
29, a blond?

472
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,276
Christ, I thought I dreamed.

473
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,713
What the hell happened to you? Wait.
She left a note.

474
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,792
"I'm gonna tell Peter everything."
How do you do it?

475
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,232
It's the clothes.

476
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,509
What?

477
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,233
Where the hell is Jackson?

478
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,119
Ladies and gentlemen!
Joey's Club Elite is proud to present...

479
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,474
Sydney Ash!

480
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,759
All my love is for your fun

481
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,358
If you keep me up on the one

482
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,389
I'm so in love with you

483
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,353
For love, honey, I'll undo

484
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,833
I just might take it off real slow

485
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,312
Maybe even turn the lights down low

486
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,713
You control my desire

487
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,717
Undress your love Baby, take me higher

488
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,911
Can you kiss me?

489
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,871
Baby, undress me

490
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,911
Can you kiss me?

491
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,478
Baby, undress

492
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,352
When I wanna rock

493
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,352
I just put my body on the top

494
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,274
You know what I wanna do

495
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,676
It's my game if you wanna play

496
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,591
There's one thing that I wanna say

497
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,598
I never lose

498
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,353
Undo me, baby, don't hold back
My love is on the one

499
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,194
Watch me and we can have some fun

500
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,591
You should come and join me, baby

501
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,558
Unwind, darling, and drive me crazy

502
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,309
Get up off of that stump, baby

503
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,671
Can you kiss me?

504
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,750
Baby, undress me

505
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,716
Can you kiss me?

506
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,750
Baby, undress

507
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,039
Good evening, sir.

508
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,634
Here's your 357. It's cleaned and ported.

509
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,959
All right.
Thank you, I'll test it in the morning.

510
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,235
- Cartier?
- Sir.

511
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,396
- Has madam arrived yet?
- No, I'm afraid not, sir.

512
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,273
Will you let me know?

513
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,469
Peter.

514
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,429
Patrice.

515
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,309
I was worried about you, honey.
They said you hadn't come home yet.

516
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,278
I came in through the back door.

517
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,559
Peter, something's wrong.

518
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,919
- What is it? Let's talk about it.
- It's Cartier.

519
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,638
I heard him on the phone today.

520
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,075
He was talking about that man Moretti.

521
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,798
The one Sergeant Jackson
showed you the picture of?

522
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,349
- You must be mistaken.
- No, I'm sure of it.

523
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,039
He said that Jackson had gotten to him,
but he couldn't tell him anything.

524
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,359
Peter, what's going on?

525
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,788
Do you trust me?

526
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,033
Of course I trust you.

527
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,034
I just have to hear you say it.

528
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,832
For me, Peter. Please!

529
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,752
I swear to you, I had nothing
to do with anybody's murder.

530
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,470
Not Frank Stringer. Not Lionel Grantham
or any friend of Jericho Jackson's.

531
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,592
Thank you, Peter.

532
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,352
Patrice, I would never do anything
to harm you, baby.

533
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,475
I just hope Sergeant Jackson
will understand.

534
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,359
Wait a minute.

535
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,749
You didn't tell Jackson any of this,
did you?

536
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,873
He came by right after
I overheard the conversation.

537
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,470
But I assured him that you
couldn't have been involved in it though.

538
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,473
I knew that you couldn't be.

539
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,197
Peter, you wouldn't talk to me.
I didn't know what to do!

540
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,870
Please don't hate me for it.

541
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,353
I don't hate you.

542
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,473
I love you!

543
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,559
More than life itself.

544
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,829
Works fine.

545
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,278
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

546
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,918
Knock yourself out?

547
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,229
- May I help you?
- I'd like to speak to Miss Ash.

548
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,590
I don't recommend that course of action.

549
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,269
I do!

550
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,630
You're one big fellow.
How much do you weigh?

551
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,869
270 pounds.

552
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,675
That's pretty big.

553
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,596
I bet you make a good living, don't you?

554
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,240
Good enough. It helps pay my way
through medical school.

555
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,117
If I was to hit you again...

556
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,069
you'd probably slam my little body
right through that wall, wouldn't you?

557
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,715
I was thinking about it.
But it goes against all my Muslim beliefs.

558
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,715
Good.

559
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,877
I take it you liked my act?

560
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,311
You know, I'm impressed.
It takes a lot to get through old Edd here.

561
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,835
Not very much, just the end of that table.

562
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,713
- He'll be out for a while.
- You don't know Edd.

563
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,153
And you don't know me.

564
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,837
- You through for the evening?
- I'm through singing.

565
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,354
It's midnight
and the night's barely started.

566
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,635
You wouldn't, by any chance,
be a diabetic?

567
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,513
Not the last time I checked.

568
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,430
What do you say,
we hasten to your chariot?

569
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,794
My chariot awaits.

570
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,676
Waiting till we're married or something?

571
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,273
No, I'd just rather a place
a little more romantic.

572
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,759
Romantic?

573
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,317
Honey, romance is where you find it.

574
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,392
And I find it wherever and whenever I can.

575
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,236
Man, you must be a priest or something.

576
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,190
I don't even know your name.
What's your name?

577
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,714
It's Jericho.

578
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,156
Jericho? See, I knew you was a priest!

579
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,117
Ain't you got a nickname or something?

580
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,312
Some folks used to call me Action.

581
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,276
Shit! I ain't seen none of that tonight.

582
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,919
Sure wasn't no woman
that gave you that name.

583
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,752
If that's for me, don't answer it.

584
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,874
This is not good.

585
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,355
A parking lot! Now this is real romantic.

586
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,036
Maybe now you'll live up to your name?

587
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,193
Body's been identified
as Patrice Dellaplane.

588
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,111
Wife of Peter Dellaplane.

589
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,478
No sign of Jackson.

590
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,915
I don't dig this talk-radio crap.
Ain't you got any rap channels?

591
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,199
- Now where are we going?
- Your place.

592
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,632
Now you're talking!

593
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,193
Well, where is she?

594
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,719
She's in the bedroom.

595
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,233
Where's the bedroom?

596
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,909
Jesus! You really think
Action Jackson did it?

597
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,798
Look, I want to put a lid
on all this. No press!

598
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,838
Your old partner seems to be
some kind of a magnet for trouble.

599
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,235
I wouldn't have it any other way.

600
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,998
Women this beautiful
don't come around too often.

601
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,071
I've always gotta see them like this.

602
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,233
Come on!

603
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,238
Hey, no lights!

604
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,397
Okay, you're the romantic here.

605
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,996
Hope I live to keep it that way.

606
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,435
I've got the munchies
like you wouldn't believe.

607
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,315
Some cherry pie, ice cream....

608
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,634
So what have we got?

609
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,637
Come on! Later, okay? Later.

610
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,479
What's wrong?
Food not romantic enough for you?

611
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,432
Do you get calls late at night?

612
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,672
- I happen to be a very popular girl!
- Sweetheart, I'm not kidding!

613
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,069
No! But this is kind of romantic now.

614
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,479
Hi, this is Sydney...

615
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,789
Jericho, what's going on?

616
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,069
That's why we don't turn on lights
or answer phones!

617
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,391
- Where we gonna go now?
- My car. Come on!

618
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,951
Wait, we gotta go back for my purse.

619
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,315
We're not going back.
We're going to a hotel.

620
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,028
But my makeup! I look terrible.

621
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,148
You look beautiful.

622
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,994
Pardon me?

623
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,632
I said you look fine.
We're not going back for your purse.

624
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,319
Jesus, man! This is getting to be real shit.

625
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,717
Where the hell are we now?

626
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,790
You sure travel in weird circles.

627
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,317
- I didn't know there was a hotel here.
- Neither does anyone else.

628
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,116
For now, you can consider Hotel Hoover
your little home away from home.

629
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,758
Hoover? Nice name.

630
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,111
- Should be clean anyway.
- Yeah.

631
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,309
There. There's the hand that feeds you.

632
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,396
Yabba-dabba-doo!

633
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,670
I dare you to bite it. Go on.

634
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,797
Bite him, Dino. Bite him. Bite him!

635
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,714
All right! That'll hold him!

636
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,076
Hope the obedience continues...

637
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,635
Hello!

638
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,110
They stole the bell.
They'd steal me if I wasn't nailed down.

639
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,399
You son of a bitch!

640
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,870
The force may fade
but the reflex never dies!

641
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,315
If you two girls wanna be alone,
I'll wait in the car.

642
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,914
Sydney, I wanna introduce
you to an old friend of mine.

643
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,833
This century, Paradise Valley
has produced two great fighters:

644
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,478
Joe Louis and Kid Sable.

645
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,193
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Louis.

646
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,156
Oh, boy! Gotta real fight fan there.

647
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:39,031
What happened to Detroit's favorite son?
We don't hear your name much anymore.

648
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,156
And all them
highfalutin ambitions you had.

649
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,434
She divorced me.

650
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,910
Any wife divorce a man at the first sign
of trouble ain't much of a wife.

651
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,117
- Seem to me, nobody asked you.
- Seem to me, like, you're right.

652
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,835
Oh, Sable, Vinnie Weldon, remember him?
What was it you did to him?

653
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,592
The Sable Surprise!

654
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,997
Soften him up with a right,
knock him flat with a left out of nowhere.

655
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,150
But its the footwork that fooled him!

656
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,392
I need a room on an unoccupied floor.
She's got a sweet tooth.

657
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,753
Room 214. We call it
the Presidential Suite.

658
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,958
Shower works sometimes. No roaches.

659
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,510
I'll have Einstein bring some breakfast
first thing in the morning.

660
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,838
- Wasn't the makeup you wanted, was it?
- Leave me alone.

661
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,392
- Why you doing it?
- What else is there?

662
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,558
That's not a good answer.

663
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,153
Jackson, what do you want?

664
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,476
There's a whole lot of things that I've done
and I do that I don't want to think about.

665
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,711
A shot a day. I do all the forgetting I need.

666
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,958
Is that good enough for you?

667
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,075
One more chance. Wanna fuck?

668
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,908
No, thanks.

669
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,799
Fine. Good night.

670
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,234
Let me in!

671
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,590
Open the door, Jackson.
Believe me, they all look the same.

672
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,833
I got your fix.

673
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,150
Rat poison?

674
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,311
Yuck, everybody's a comedian.

675
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,914
Easy, kid.

676
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,197
You're Action Jackson!

677
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,194
Yeah, right.

678
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,228
Some action!

679
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,791
Fine-looking woman like me,
and you wouldn't even touch me all night?

680
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,632
You either gotta be queer or a cop.

681
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,954
I'm not queer.

682
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,712
Sergeant Jericho Jackson.
13th Precinct, City of Detroit.

683
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,588
I wanna get to Peter Dellaplane.
I figure you can help.

684
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,477
What's Dellaplane got to do with me?

685
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,232
You kidding? He owns you.

686
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,356
- He rents me.
- Six of one half...

687
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,668
dozen of the other.

688
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,514
Either way, consider us officially
joined at the hip till I get this case closed.

689
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,828
So you need me?

690
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,549
What makes you think I need
a junkie like you?

691
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,598
If it weren't for me, you'd be
splattered all over your apartment.

692
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,671
Now hurry up. We got some people to see.

693
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,031
I'm so fucked up, I feel fine.

694
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,639
Is it okay if we stop for a fix.
Maybe just a little one?

695
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,154
Sorry, Sydney.
You're just gonna have to make do.

696
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,554
Sorry, Jackson.
You're just gonna have to make do.

697
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,957
Son of a bitch!
What the hell have they done to my car?

698
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,916
Do you know how long I've had this car?

699
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,036
Do you know how much work
I've put into it?

700
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,473
Do you know how much...

701
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,235
a primo-conditioned fully operational
'66 Chevy Impala convertible is worth?

702
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,518
Are we gonna play "You Know How"?
Because I got a good one.

703
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,068
- You know how bad I need a fix.
- Keep quiet.

704
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,197
Why not have your police buddies
track the stolen parts?

705
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,669
- Be quiet!
- How foolish of me, expecting...

706
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,035
Excuse me, man. Sorry, man, sorry.

707
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,434
Fuck a duck!

708
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,393
He was an informant named
Papa Doc. He worked here.

709
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,277
You didn't take my wallet, did you?

710
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,995
You sure are some kind of a detective.
You could teach Mr. T a thing or two.

711
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,278
With thinking like that,
you'll be in the A-Team in no time.

712
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,397
Let's see what Papa Doc
can tell us about Dellaplane.

713
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,277
- What can I do for you?
- How is it going?

714
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,635
I'm looking for Papa Doc.
Wonder if he works here?

715
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,190
Wonder no more. If you'll hold on
a moment, I can lead you to him.

716
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,192
Hold up. Hold up.

717
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,953
Wait a second.
I thought we were attached to the hip.

718
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,794
Don't worry. They give me any smack,
I'll be sure to save some for you.

719
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,432
I'll be here if you need me.

720
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,749
- Where is he?
- Open it up.

721
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,430
What is it, some kind of a secret passage?

722
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,195
Open it up.

723
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,274
Jar.

724
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,395
That's Papa Doc?

725
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,189
It's his balls!

726
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,156
Damn! Wake up!

727
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,389
Damn, you a big john!

728
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,554
What?

729
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,672
You think I'm geechie or something?

730
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,997
Don't bogard me, lightfoot.
There's nothing we'd like better...

731
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,958
than to take a Tom Slick like you
and have a blanket party.

732
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,158
You know something?
I don't understand what you're saying.

733
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,119
You're dissing me. Don't diss me!
I'm gonna break it down to you.

734
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,153
See, you be a Charlie Irvine
and we gonna tap dance on your lips.

735
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,072
And then we gonna deprive you
of your frick and frack.

736
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,276
I don't understand a word of it, do you?

737
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,150
All right, okay. Hey, you, old man!

738
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,030
He ain't giving up no air.
I think we have to jam him up his shit.

739
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,749
Hello, my friend.

740
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,715
Hello.

741
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,997
What he was trying to ask you is this:

742
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,798
why you looking for Papa Doc?

743
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,029
Where is he?

744
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,872
We try this one more time, very slow.
And you watch the bouncing ball.

745
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,676
Why you looking for Papa Doc?

746
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,875
Where is he?

747
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,192
You better answer, man.

748
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,675
You piece of shit.

749
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,158
Papa Doc was a very valuable source
of information to us.

750
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,231
A regular Library of Congress.

751
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,959
Unfortunately, like so many libraries, bro,
his books were open to the public.

752
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,874
You ever heard the sound a man makes...

753
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,711
when he gets his balls cut off?

754
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,273
- No.
- No?

755
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,431
Then you're in for a big treat, bro.
Because it's hot dog time!

756
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,431
You're gonna sing for us,
my friend. But the question is...

757
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,274
will you sing as a man? Or a woman?

758
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,955
Cut him!

759
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,678
What you doing with my brother?
Ain't you all old to play doctor?

760
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,159
Get your ass out of here.

761
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,309
You're his sister?

762
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,470
He's just my soul brother.
'Course I'm his sister.

763
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,198
Wait a minute! Come here!

764
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,033
You may not notice,
the boy ain't driving with a full tank.

765
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,590
He spent a year in Bellevue.
Got this delusion he's a holy messenger.

766
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,912
He's a lot more oral than Oral Roberts.
Listen to him.

767
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,716
Yes, I was sent!

768
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,710
I was sent to bring you down, brother!

769
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,917
I was sent to bust your asses
and wipe these streets clean!

770
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,190
- I'm the man!
- Why looking for him?

771
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,636
You may possess his righteous manhood,
but his soul's free and clear!

772
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,757
- He's got a plate in his head.
- Somebody give me an amen!

773
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,032
This motherfucker's crazy, man.

774
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,712
I give myself an amen. Amen!

775
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,033
Yes, I can hear it!

776
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,193
I can feel it! I can feel it!

777
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,239
Allow me, allow me
to lay my healing hand upon you! Yes!

778
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,954
Oh, shit!

779
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,315
Hey, brother.

780
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,274
Surely you won't leave
before you give me an amen?

781
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,749
Amen!

782
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,959
Let's get out of here.

783
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,312
I saved your life back there.

784
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,630
No, you got it all wrong.
We saved each other.

785
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,393
You think they would let us
waltz out on a song and dance?

786
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,789
I don't know. I'm a pretty fine singer.

787
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,470
Back there you seemed like
a fine dancer to me.

788
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,199
If you're saying we make a great team,
I beg to differ.

789
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,910
- You got something against women?
- No, just against junkies.

790
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,237
You got a quick mind.
Ever think you're wasting it on that crap?

791
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,993
Gotta remind me?
Ain't thought about it in 10 minutes.

792
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,755
- Got that taste back in my mouth.
- Come on.

793
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,868
Go on upstairs.
I gotta have a few words with Kid.

794
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,951
You trust me to go upstairs alone?

795
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,478
Yeah, I guess I do.

796
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,758
- Where've you been?
- I've been looking for Papa Doc.

797
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,593
I could've saved you time.
The man is dead.

798
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,191
- His balls is in a jar at Snooker's Pool Hall.
- I know. They almost had a little company.

799
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,396
You need a new source of information.

800
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,629
Okay.

801
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,917
Tell you what to do.
Go down to Dee Love's Barbershop...

802
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,793
on the corner of Custer and Saint Antoine.
Ask for Dee.

803
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,914
Dellaplane's former partner
was a multimillionaire...

804
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,390
and an all-around deviant
named Enzo Catelli.

805
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,397
Catelli lived in Rome, and as a defense
against kidnapping attempts...

806
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:29,191
he formed an elite group of bodyguards,
which he called "The Invisible Men"...

807
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:34,190
due to their almost demonic ability
to remain completely undetected.

808
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,238
But Catelli's dead, isn't he?

809
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,871
Alas, he had no defense
against his bodyguard's greed.

810
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,592
Dellaplane financed Catelli's demise.

811
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:48,874
And the untimely departure
of the first Mrs. Dellaplane as well.

812
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,798
He might even have
deployed them against you...

813
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,158
but your demotion
made that unnecessary.

814
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,869
Were they also responsible
for the AWA killings?

815
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,109
Undeniably so.

816
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,119
Norman was decapitated
in an auto accident.

817
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,758
Stringer was defenestrated.

818
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,070
And Grantham joined the debris
in the Detroit River!

819
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,995
It's likely that they intended
to denounce Dellaplane...

820
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:19,029
and defy his determined attempts
to devise a power base in the AWA.

821
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,598
But alas, motives are not my department.

822
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,229
Just the delivery of details.

823
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,395
How can I get to talk to Oliver O'R ooney?

824
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,678
He can usually be found
late at night at the Red Devil.

825
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,229
Unless I am deceived.

826
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,910
Dee, thanks a lot.

827
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,111
As I said, I can't pay you but...

828
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,470
I'm always delighted to help a detective.

829
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,431
Especially the defiantly indefatigable
Action Jackson.

830
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,155
I'm back.

831
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,468
Sydney?

832
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,195
Damn!

833
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,915
Where's Sydney?

834
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,228
She didn't go by me.

835
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,632
- You got a pusher in the building?
- Jackson, I run a respectable hotel!

836
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,993
Calls himself Mr. Quick, room 303.

837
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,672
Easy on the door!

838
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,038
The rabbi says to the Pope...

839
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,873
Kornblau, please. Put a sock in it.

840
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,157
I got roaches in my apartment
that tell better jokes than you...

841
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,915
and they don't laugh during the
punch line all the time. Please, thank you.

842
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,873
Wait a minute.
Wasn't that Jackson's car back there?

843
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,319
Always one when you don't need one.

844
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,152
She's with me, motherfucker!

845
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,713
Bad career move.

846
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,800
Watch your language in front of the lady.

847
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,519
Honey, you don't wanna pull that shit
on Action Jackson.

848
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,439
This is Action Jackson?

849
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,754
This will be easier than I thought.
I'm gonna cut you deep, motherfucker!

850
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,035
Very good. You write your own material?

851
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,479
Your ass is mine.

852
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,875
You know,
that's exactly what I was gonna say!

853
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,113
I'm gonna kick your heart and shove
it down your throat, you cocksucking...

854
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,988
Fuck you.

855
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,798
I warned you about the language!

856
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,755
It's his car.

857
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,517
Jackson, stay right there!

858
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,516
- Come on.
- There's no fire escape.

859
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,558
You gotta learn to leap before
you look. One...

860
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,993
Would you like a double bed?

861
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,115
...two...

862
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,555
...three!

863
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,834
Jackson!

864
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,956
Why are we running?
You're a cop, aren't you?

865
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,396
Of course I am.
That's why we're taking this. Get in!

866
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,392
Stop!

867
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,558
Come on! Let's go!

868
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,714
I could recommend
a good bathhouse if you like.

869
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,034
Stop the car!

870
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,038
Hold it! Jackson!

871
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,276
Hold it! Police!

872
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,669
Police emergency!
We're commandeering your car!

873
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,318
The fuck you are!

874
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,713
Should we run after him?

875
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,917
Kornblau, you ever have
your head rammed up your ass?

876
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,589
I don't think so.

877
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,792
Mark it on your calendar.
That day is coming.

878
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,310
Why haven't you answered my question?
Why are we running from the cops?

879
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,119
Dellaplane killed his wife
and put the body at my place.

880
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,634
The cops think I did it.
Are you gonna help me or not?

881
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,870
Why should I trust you? You're a cop!

882
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,269
You're wanted for murder.
Your name is Action?

883
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,239
I need a fix! Give me a few bucks
and drop me off at a bus station.

884
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,039
Sure I'll drop you.
You won't live long enough to enjoy it.

885
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,792
Dellaplane's gonna kill you too.

886
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,231
- What are you doing?
- You want a rush?

887
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,838
I'll give you a rush!

888
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,077
- What do you want?
- Help me nail him!

889
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,230
- I don't have to.
- Wanna let him kill you?

890
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,153
Want to die?
Why waste time, this is quicker!

891
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,469
You're crazy!

892
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,915
- I need your help.
- Stop.

893
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,592
- I'll help you!
- What?

894
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,513
I said all right! I'll help you! I'll do it!

895
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,070
- That wasn't so bad, was it?
- Why do I put up with your shit?

896
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,516
It must be my charm and my good looks.

897
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,837
It sure the hell isn't your driving.

898
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,917
He should be in the Red Devil bar.

899
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,560
It's important to get him
far away from Dellaplane.

900
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,312
You sure you understand what to do?

901
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,311
Yes, of course I understand.

902
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,195
But I feel like shit!

903
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,472
I feel like my teeth are hollow
and my gums are made of dry rubber.

904
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,155
And like someone's trying to start
a bonfire in the back of my head.

905
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,712
I think I felt that way once.

906
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,668
They called it love.

907
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,591
You were married once, weren't you?

908
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,197
- Yeah, she divorced me two years ago.
- Why?

909
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,398
She felt my career was advancing
in the wrong direction.

910
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,395
Jackson, it's her loss.

911
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,719
Excuse me.

912
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,159
I'm looking for a man named
Oliver O'R ooney.

913
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,032
Yeah, he's over there.

914
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,154
Mind if I join you?

915
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,150
What's a nice girl like you doing here?

916
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,434
I'm not that nice.

917
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,628
Even better.

918
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,599
Dellaplane sent me.

919
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,913
He says he wants to see you.

920
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,708
I don't believe you.

921
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,757
He says it's about tomorrow night.

922
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,675
Here you are, girls. Two beers.

923
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,753
I can't believe Dellaplane
would be up this early.

924
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,070
Is he gonna be there or
keep me waiting as usual?

925
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,118
Don't worry about it, okay?
He's gonna be there.

926
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,949
Why the hell's he wanna meet me
out here?

927
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,112
He probably don't want you
smelling up his house.

928
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,237
- All right. Where the hell is he?
- Come on. Let's go!

929
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,599
How much further?

930
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,350
Couldn't he have met us on the first floor?

931
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,032
I'm sure your convenience
is one of his main concerns.

932
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,514
He's up there.

933
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,754
Up here.

934
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,158
You're not Dellaplane.

935
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,074
You know who I am?

936
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,436
You're Jackson, the local boy
who didn't make it so good after all.

937
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,590
That's right. What's happening tonight?

938
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,875
Party. Party for Raymond Foss.

939
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,916
What's happening at the party?

940
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,228
Dinner.

941
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,034
Dancing.

942
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,873
Don't screw around with me!

943
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,598
All right! He's gonna kill Foss.

944
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,630
Why?

945
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,718
So I can take his place,
and be the President of the Union.

946
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,279
Who's gonna kill him?

947
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,759
You sure you wanna know?

948
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,231
Do I look like a man who has trouble
making up my mind? Who?

949
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,674
You are!

950
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,398
Jackson!

951
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,918
I would imagine you have
a thousand questions.

952
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,433
So please feel free to ask.

953
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,993
Why do you wanna kill Foss?

954
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,999
Controlling the union won't
help your company that much.

955
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,674
That's true, really.
If cars were all I cared about...

956
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,150
it wouldn't be worth the effort, would it?

957
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,958
But my cars are just a hobby.

958
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,877
See, my real interest, Sergeant, is power.

959
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:02,113
And the AWA is more than
just a union. It is a power block.

960
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,710
And don't ever underestimate
their strength.

961
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,791
For instance, in 1976...

962
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,070
they helped elect a Georgia peanut farmer
to the highest office...

963
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,038
You're saying we have President
Dellaplane to look forward to?

964
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,599
No, not really.

965
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,672
I'm a kingmaker rather than a king.

966
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,275
There's an old cliche that says:
"True power rests behind the throne."

967
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,718
Fortunately, we have a government that's
proven that cliche true, time and again.

968
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,756
Of course, to implement
that kind of power, one must have a tool.

969
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,399
And murder is a tool.

970
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,709
You think I may like to murder
just for the entertainment value.

971
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,394
I have to admit, it's a lot of fun
once in a while.

972
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,990
My first wife and my partner had to
die because of financial interests.

973
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,635
Patrice, on the other hand,
was becoming a problem.

974
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,793
She was beginning to jeopardize my entire
operation and I couldn't stand for that.

975
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,918
The thing that breaks me up is my son.

976
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,791
One day soon, he may have to join them.

977
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,071
You know, an altercation
in the old prison shower.

978
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,670
That sort of thing happens all the time.

979
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,116
So, how are you gonna
kill Foss and get away with it?

980
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,795
Good question.

981
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,794
Mr. Gamble here will take care of that.

982
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,718
And he will be dressed
exactly like you at the time.

983
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:31,119
To most of my guests
you all look alike anyway.

984
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,313
They'll assume
that you're on a mission to kill me...

985
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,556
after your senseless murder of my wife.

986
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,159
And the interesting thing is,
your getaway car will crash and burn.

987
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,113
Your charred body
will be discovered among the ruins...

988
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,874
and you'll be identified
from your dental records.

989
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,712
And the case will be neatly closed.

990
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,599
Immaculate.

991
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,389
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I think so too.

992
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,479
That only leaves Sydney.

993
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,238
She will die of an overdose.

994
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,675
But not until I fuck her one last time.

995
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,114
You really shouldn't wear
your heart on your sleeve.

996
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,032
It's very unbecoming.

997
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,396
What do you want from me, Dellaplane?

998
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,591
What do you want from me?

999
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,717
I want you to die.

1000
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:42,273
Dellaplane, one of these days,
you're gonna really piss me off.

1001
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,513
Thaw, get the gasoline.
We're gonna have us a little barbecue.

1002
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,352
Tell me where it hurts.

1003
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,595
Hello, I'm Mr. Edd!

1004
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,589
- You called about a paint job?
- No!

1005
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,829
Chill out!

1006
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,874
Looking for me?

1007
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,989
Barbecue?

1008
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,599
How do you like your ribs?

1009
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,029
Hi.

1010
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,353
Fine, thank you.

1011
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,108
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1012
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,028
Thanks.

1013
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,079
Thank you, yeah.

1014
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,031
Why did you have to bring me along?

1015
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,315
- You remind me of a friend.
- Why not bring him?

1016
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,628
He's dead.

1017
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,955
Damn, man!
Why'd you have to tell me that?

1018
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,071
I recommend the crab cake.

1019
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,989
Peter, I'm scandalized!
There was no one there to park our car.

1020
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,510
- I'm sorry. I'll see that something's done.
- Please. Nice to see you.

1021
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,556
- You look wonderful.
- Thanks.

1022
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,270
All right something's wrong.
I want you to check out front. Hustle!

1023
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,474
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?

1024
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,518
Ladies and gentlemen, please!
Your attention, just for a moment.

1025
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,750
I want you to meet our birthday boy...

1026
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,232
Raymond Foss! Ray, come on up here
and say a few words.

1027
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,074
Raymond Foss.

1028
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,919
- Run.
- Run?

1029
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,989
Run!

1030
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,553
Excuse me, sir!

1031
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,392
I'm very happy to see
so many old friends here tonight...

1032
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,311
to celebrate my birthday with me.

1033
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,750
This evening is the happiest evening
of my life.

1034
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,389
Excuse me, sorry.

1035
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,552
Looks like someone else
is having a good time out there.

1036
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,599
Someone tell that young man that
there'll be plenty of cake for everyone.

1037
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,758
Dellaplane did it!

1038
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,677
Dellaplane did it!

1039
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,995
He planned...

1040
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:56,990
Get out of the way!
Get the chopper. I'll meet you there!

1041
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,993
Going someplace?

1042
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,358
- You're Kid Sable, aren't you?
- You better believe it, brother!

1043
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,599
Excuse me, sir.

1044
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,280
I hope this teaches you, crime doesn't pay.

1045
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,509
Yeah.

1046
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,199
Jackson!

1047
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,191
Where do you think you're going?

1048
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,748
- You gonna take me in?
- Any reason why I shouldn't?

1049
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,153
Jackson! Jackson!

1050
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,990
- Fuck it!
- Thanks.

1051
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,029
Easy, baby.

1052
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,594
Get out of the way!

1053
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,189
You lose.

1054
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,229
Hot.

1055
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,709
Hotter.

1056
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,115
Hottest!

1057
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,633
Christ!

1058
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,230
You haven't learned your lesson?

1059
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,588
Teach me.

1060
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,629
Come on.

1061
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,478
Just shoot him!

1062
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,797
Jackson, what are you doing?
Just shoot the son of a bitch!

1063
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,956
Jackson, what are you doing?

1064
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,118
Jackson. Don't do it!

1065
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,948
Now you pissed me off!

1066
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,439
- How did he miss?
- He didn't.

1067
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,440
- Are you all right?
- Hell, no. I've been shot!

1068
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,999
Check him out.

1069
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,799
How bad is it?

1070
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,072
This is one dead piece-of-shit car builder.

1071
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,193
I want the paramedics and
a meat wagon down here right away.

1072
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,315
Yes, sir.

1073
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,914
I want a report on my desk in the morning.

1074
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,912
- In the morning?
- In the morning, Lieutenant.

1075
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,869
Lieutenant?

1076
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,799
- Lieutenant?
- Is there an echo around here?

1077
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,070
You said you wouldn't team with a junkie.

1078
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,798
How about an ex-junkie?

1079
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,439
Wait a minute. You kidding?

1080
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:48,035
Cold turkey. You can have me
on Thanksgiving. How's that?

1081
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,238
Can I have you any sooner?
