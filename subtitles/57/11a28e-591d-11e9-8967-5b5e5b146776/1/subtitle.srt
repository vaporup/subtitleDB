Erika Eleniak was somewhat of a pioneer regarding breast implants, you know?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,500
She got them during the mid-80's

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
already at that time implants were still bullshit

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,500
But Pamela Anderson was smarter, she waited until the mid-90's

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Sort of after the "Silicon Revolution"

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,500
And she got some real first-rate gourmet hooters. The best there were from the best doctor

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
The guy was sort of the Mohammed Ali of plastic surgery.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
That guy was married to that one actress, 
the blonde one... what was her name?

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Kim Basinger!

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
They are divorced now, but never mind

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Anyway,

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,800
you get my point?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Erika had no problem until the third season

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,500
when the directors decided to send the crew travelling

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,500
They had Baywatch in Mexico and in Japan and so on

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
And there the doctors became suspicious

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
They just knew that the bullshit silicon in Erikas tits

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,500
was not designed to sustain pressure fluctuations

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Domestic flights were ok

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,500
but long distance flights, above 10,000 meters. 
The risk was just too high.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
So they preferred Pamela Andersons superior implants

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,500
That means the only reason why Erika Eleniak got fired was

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,500
cause her tits exploded too easily.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,800
 - Got it
 - Seriously

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
And that's that

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
So don't tell me about good acting or style or something

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,800
or not?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Right?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,500
mhmm

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,800
what "mhmm"?

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,500
You gotta have an opinion about that

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,500
- Nope, I really don't
- Come on, don't be so boring now

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Sorry, I just decided not to talk about such things any more

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
about what?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
About things like which Baywatch babe has more style

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,500
It simply has no substance

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
"No substance?!?"

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah!

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Aha!

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,500
You're just trying to talk about something cool,
and don't care for the meaning.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,500
I know you made the story up.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
Thought it's pretty clever, so you want to tell it. 

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,500
And you tell me just like that!

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
And that's alright...

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,500
...but we don't need to talk about that for hours.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Ok, sorry, ok.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,500
So what do you want to talk about?

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,500
- Don't know!
- Oh you don't know?!?

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
You know what you don't want to talk about

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
...but you don't know what you want to talk about...

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
...What do you want to talk about? Tell me

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
...well...about something important...

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
...problems of real life.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
..."problems of real life"?

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
 - Yes
 - Dude

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
What?

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Nothing

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Yes

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Well, it's alright.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
When did you think about that?

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
Just before

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,500
Aha! Just before, while I was rolling a joint...

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,500
...you thought: OK from now on I talk about real life problems...

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Yep

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,500
...completely spontaneous...

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Dude, you're a freak sometimes.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
Cool!!!

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Hey

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
Hello

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Gina, we have to talk.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,800
What is it?

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
I think we have to break up

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,500
I think I can't remain faithful while you're away.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
I could tell you some fake reasons..

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,500
...but you deserve honesty...

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
...It's your hygiene.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Excuse me?

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
You don't take care of yourself anymore.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
You sweat like a pig.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Do you still shower at all?

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,500
Certain body parts are simply disgusting!

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,500
Call me hypersensitive

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,500
But I just can't stand it anymore.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,500
It's nice what stories you can come up with.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
As a matter of fact I am sitting here doing something...

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
...clean up...,
all you do is get stoned.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,500
For a while it was funny, but...

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,500
...I don't want that circus anymore.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,500
And actually I never planned to ever come back from America

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
I met somebody there...

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
...Josef...

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
...he's a broker...

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,500
...hard working, pays attention, charming...

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,500
...black too!

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,500
and for the Future:

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,500
Women can have vaginal orgasms!

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,500
Josef? Black?

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,500
That was a top-notch story.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,500
The beginning was really good

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,500
It was much better than your cheap story

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
But then "vaginal orgasms"? Come on

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
You just can't stand losing

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,800
 - Take your shirt off
 - oh no

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
oh yes

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800


107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
But not a big one, ok?

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,500
A normal one, that's the deal.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,500
Come on!

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,500
Give it to me!

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Give it to me!!!

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Hey, this is no campsite!

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Shut up! Fucking cunt!

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Can this guy say one normal sentence?

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,500
Frank! Countenance

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Hey, Kai
What the hell?

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Why do you let these potheads hang out here?

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,500


119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
No!!

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,500
When we come back you're gone, alright?

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh shit!!!

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
Fuck!!!

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
We don't leave for too long, ok?

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
- OK
- I have to study

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
"I have to study"

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Hey, I got an exam in 2 months.

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh and I keep you from learning?

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
- I could use a little support....
- I told you...

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,800
- ...a little support.

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,500
...I told you I can do this alone.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,800
And besides I support you as much as I can.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,500
Oh is that so?
And how?

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,500
I....I....
when you're done studying...

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll pick you up

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,500
And serve you a gourmet pizza, as a sign of my respect.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,500
- How thoughtful.
- That's how much you mean to me.

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,800
You care so much.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,500
I do indeed.

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
THE INFILTRATION

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,500
Dealing is dangerous.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,500
My father just sentenced one guy for 3 years

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
for possession of 100 grams.

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
100 grams?
3 years?

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Yes

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,500
You dad is a nice guy, but sometimes he's a fucking Nazi.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,500
- Don't you think the high stand looks in use?
- I won't answer that anymore.

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,500
Look in the top corner there is some moss scratched off.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,500
Yea there is some moss scratched off your brain.
We investigated the place, it's out of order!

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't know.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
Be happy! Everything is fine, everything grows.

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,500
Everything is well hidden

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,500
Plenty of sunlight
Good soil...

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
- Stefan
- What?

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,800
Greenflies

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Greenflies?!?!

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,500
Yes greenflies!!! Check this out!!!

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
They are everywhere.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Shit

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Vinegar should help

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,800
What?

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Vinegar helps

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
- Vinegar?!?
- Yes.

163
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,500
You mean vinegar?!?
We can't just experiment with vinegar on our crops.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,500
We need serious help.

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,500
Useful plant or ornamental plant?

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,500
Flower, bush, herbaceous plant...?

167
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Useful plant.
Definitely useful.

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
- You think it's herbaceous?
- How the hell should I know.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Listen, is this a pharmacy or what?

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,500
We need something against greenflies.
Can't be so hard, can it?

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,500
You need to plan carefully.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Without knowing the name of the plant I can't help you.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
Thank you, we will try somewhere else.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Now you listen to me!

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,500
I won't bend down in front of some "florist codex"...

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,500
...You can't treat people like that!

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Of course we go in there.

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Stefan! Listen, ok?

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,500
People in those shops have no style, Ok?

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,500
They study new age spirituality, 
and fuck chicks with hairy arm pits.

181
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,800
I never hung out with those clichÃ© potheads and I won't start now, ok?

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
Stefan, wait.
Stefan.

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,500
Let's take off, did you see that guy?
No way!

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,500
Let's just ask, ok?
Don't be so intolerant.

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,500
- No way!
- Think about the greenflies

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
OK let's go.

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Excuse me, I might be able to help you.

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
I also grow crops. 

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,800
Grow what?

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,500
Yea alright, well I can tell you there is a cure for greenflies.

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,500
Especially for big plants.

192
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,500
The stereotype of political left wingers as fucked up potheads is old fashioned.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
THC abuse exists in all professions

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,500
...all social classes,
and all ages...

195
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,500
The aim is:

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
"Know your enemy"

197
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,500
Aphidoteles aphidimyza, rÃ¤uberische GallmÃ¼cken-
a secret weapon.

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,500
One larvae kills up to 50 greenflies and then takes off.
No problem for the plant.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
Where do you know that from?

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,500
Well when you do this business professionally
you have to teach yourself some things.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm a fan of zero-zero.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,500
That's dank stuff.

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,800
You know zero-zero?

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
- Yea of course
- Back then

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,500
You have to be able to roll a joint.

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,500
But even more important is the presentation.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
"Awesome shit man" 
Nonsense, nobody talks like that anymore.

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Only social pedagogues and teachers

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,500
This shit kicks better than Mehmet Scholl.

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Trying too hard.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
No this dope....my dear friends.

212
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,500
This dope is the deluxe version.

213
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,500
This dope is...

214
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
"Die Jacobs-KrÃ¶nung des THC"

215
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
"Die Jacobs-KrÃ¶nung des THC"?

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
If I smoke another one now I can't study anymore.

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,500
"If I smoke another one now I can't study anymore"

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Alright one more.

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,500
And that is the only reason why she was fired.

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,500
I say that theory is bollocks.

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
- Air planes have pressure cabins...
- So what?

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,500
Sorry guys but Kai has got a point.
Have you ever heard of the porn star Karla Kowalcyk?

223
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Called "Karla Super Fist",  breast perimeter 142 cm.

224
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,500
- "Four Fists for One Hallelujah"...
- ...was her last movie.

225
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,500
Karla was a customer of my cousin Dominik,
He was sort of her pimp.

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
Domino is a little weird but honest.

227
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
He always took care of her...

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,500
...especially since he made sure she traveled only in
small planes that fly low.

229
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,500
But on the way to her shooting for
"The Super Fist Hits Again" it happened...

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
Karla misses her flight...

231
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,500
...but she never wanted to miss an appointment
and so she takes a Boeing 737.

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,800
And then?

233
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,500
When the plane reached its final height it happened.

234
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,500
The entire business class was messed up...

235
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,500
And the super fist never hit again.

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
Makes sense.

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Man that is a sad story, don't you think?

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,800
What's wrong?

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
- Haaalooo?
- I'm black and white.

240
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
You're what?

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
Look I'm black and white man.

242
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,500
That's not funny man, I'm black and white!

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
He's black and white.

244
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Zero-zero, sometimes it even kicks in late.

245
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,500
One of my buddies didn't feel anything for 3 days.
Then the devil appeared to him...

246
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,500
...sat in front of his bed, and watched him.
Seriously!

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Did you hear that, Stefan?

248
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
Wanna smoke another one?

249
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
STEFANS' LITTLE SISTER

250
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Don't panic, go do the AIDS test now 
and you show some optimism.

251
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Kai, I'm showing realism.

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,500
That guys girlfriend is HIV positive.

253
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,500
Don't think I'm just trying to make myself important, ok?

254
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,800
But I slept with him without a condom and his girlfriend is HIV positive.

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,500
That is pretty frightening.

256
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,800
Well I know one thing for sure.

257
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,500
If that test is negative I will never cheat on Tim again.

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,500
All this cheating sucks anyway.
30 of minutes fun and a months long bad conscience.

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
3 months of hell.

260
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
3 months?

261
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,500
It takes that long to detect HIV.

262
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,500
During that time I didn't sleep with Tim.

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
What?
3 months?

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,500
Well sure, what else should I do?

265
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,500
And what did he say?

266
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
I told him I had an infection and that was ok for him.

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,500
Ok for him?
3 months?

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Get over it, ok?
I know you think he's a jerk

269
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,500
but I was ok with it too.

270
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
You got a code name for the test?

271
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Hmm?

272
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,800
A code name for the test.

273
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,500
Nope, i'll think of one later.

274
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,500
What is that?

275
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,500
That's important, you have to think of that before.

276
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,500
What if you can't think of any?

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,500
Then you say your name is "funny bee".
You can't do that.

278
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,500
I guess you have one already?

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,500
Yes. Yes...

280
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,500
...I thought about it for a long time.

281
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800


282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,500
...it's like that...
...it's gotta be a cool name.

283
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Not aggressively cool...

284
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,500
...but the coolness has to be underneath the surface?

285
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Got it?

286
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,500
Mr Pink.

287
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
Mr Pink?

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,500
Mr Pink, you know?
From "Reservoir Dogs", the movie, you know?

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,500
Yea, Mr Pink...

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,800
A cool name for a cool character, right?

291
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,500
And it's got some sort of understatement...

292
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,500
...cause the movie is not that famous.

293
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,500
I need some information for statistics.

294
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,500
First you need one code name.

295
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Mr Pink!

296
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
One word only please.

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,800
What do you mean?

298
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Am I not speaking German? 
One word only!

299
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,500
Well "Pink" then.

300
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,500
"Pink", alright.

301
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,500
I suppose I don't need to ask about your sexual habits.

302
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The test takes 30 minutes.
You can get the results here then.

303
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,500
"Sexual habits", that stupid bi...

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,500
I should have said "Ã¤ugeln".

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,500
30 more minutes.
Shit.

306
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,500
I know what to do in the meantime.

307
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
If that shit breaks out I will go away immediately.

308
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Somewhere in the south.

309
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,500
I'll get an inflatable mattress and 2 bottles of rum...

310
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,500
...and paddle out into the pacific.

311
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Then I drink until I pass out, 
and slip into the sea.

312
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,500
That way the fish get food, 
my family has no bad conscience...

313
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,500
...and I can get drunk,...

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,500
...I'm definitely not gonna die of AIDS.

315
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,500
More like from asthma, eh?
A pity...

316
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
Don't exhale.

317
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,500
That's what I call a shottie, wasn't it?

318
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,500
Laura...

319
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,500
Hey I'm "negative" you're "negative". 
We are both "negative"!

320
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,500
Show some enthusiasm!
Be happy!

321
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,500
I can't I'm too stoned.
Sorry.

322
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,500
Man I... I'm so horny.

323
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Uuu!

324
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,800
So Tim has something to look forward to...

325
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,500
...for his surprise party tonight.

326
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Ahm!

327
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,800
"Ahm"!

328
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,500
Thanks for coming with me.

329
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,800
I'll never do that again.

330
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,500
- You were a big help.
- But still, I'll never do that again.

331
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,500
By the way...

332
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,500
...what the hell is "Ã¤ugeln"?

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,500
I can't believe you told her that.

334
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Come on Kai!

335
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,500
What can I say, Dopex...you know I am an aesthete.

336
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,500
Youâve known Laura since she was a kid.
You have a responsibility for her.

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,500
Man sometimes you're a real motherfucker.
This fucking "dissing around" all the time.

338
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
What did you just say?

339
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,500
Did you listen to me? 
How can you tell my little sister about "Ã¤ugeln"?

340
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,500
Did you hear what he just called me?

341
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,800
He called me a "Motherfucker"...

342
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,800
Really? Seriously?

343
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,800
Yes

344
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,500
Sorry Dopex, but saying "motherfucker" is just...
embarrassing.

345
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,500
I mean it would be ok, 
but when the rest is this "homeboy style" stereotype shit...

346
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,800


347
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,500
And pack in your shit.

348
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,500
I told you a thousand times that you should not bring your stuff here.

349
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,800
Talking about style.

350
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,500
What style is that to tell my little sister about "Ã¤ugeln"?

351
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,500
You can't do that, she is still a child!

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,800
He's coming

353
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,500
THE SUPRISE PARTY

354
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,500
He puts his bag down...

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,500
Gets a drink...

356
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,500
What is he doing?

357
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,500
A vacuum cleaner?

358
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
He is vacuuming?

359
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,500
On his bloody birthday?

360
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,500
Screw it, we go up, but be quiet.

361
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,500
Who are these hairy bitches?

362
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,500
Come on let's go somewhere else.

363
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,500
He is actually quite alright,
just a little messed up.

364
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,500
Tourette's syndrome or something like that.

365
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,500
He can't say one sentence without swearing.

366
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,500
If he smokes pot it's better, but without pot...

367
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,500
Now that I think about it. Maybe he just fakes it
so that people give him pot.

368
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,500


369
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,800
What's going on?

370
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,500
Tim said you're here. The party is cancelled...

371
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,500
- I'm getting a drink
- Me too

372
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,500
Tim masturbated with his vacuum cleaner.

373
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,800
His vacuum cleaner?

374
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,500
Yea. He somehow got surprised...

375
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,500
...and then he stood there with the thing.
And sort of...

376
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,500
slipped his dick into it and got stuck in the underpressure.

377
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,500
And that's when things became humiliating.

378
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,500
Until somebody had a good idea.

379
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
What's with my sister now?

380
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,500
Well I immediately brought her here...

381
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,500
...before things could get any worse.

382
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,500
Hey little sis.
You alright?

383
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,500
Don't drink too much, ok?

384
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,500
I'm better already.

385
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,500
- One more?
- Definitely

386
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,500
See Dopex? So crappy that it is cool again.
That is true style.

387
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,500
You know, Laura?

388
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,500
I think I love you a little bit.

389
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,500
Yea, that's ok.

390
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Are you alright in there?

391
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,800
Where is Stefan?

392
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,500
He went home. Gina is leaving tomorrow.

393
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,500
I wanna go home too.

394
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,500
Pretty embarrassing thing with Tim, eh?

395
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,500
Weird, I decide not to cheat on him anymore.

396
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,500
And then I catch him cheating on me.

397
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,500
...with his vacuum cleaner...

398
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,500
 - Want a shottie?
 - We have nothing to smoke.

399
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,500
What?

400
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Shit, I shouldn't have done that.

401
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
No it's ok.

402
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,500
Sorry...

403
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,500
...it's not your fault.

404
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,500
You don't have to apologize now.

405
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,500
It was a long day today.
Gotta go.

406
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,500
3 months without a girlfriend.
It's gonna be awesome for you.

407
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
Why's that?

408
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,500
Who was the one who said...

409
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,500
...I enjoy being together with my girl the most when she is not there?

410
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,800
That was before.

411
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Oh I see

412
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,500
With Gina everything changed.

413
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,800
- Really
- Yea of course

414
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,500
- What?
- Yea sure

415
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,500
This woman has everything that I need.

416
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,500
It's all about different things.

417
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,800
Totally different.

418
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,500
We are about solidarity...

419
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,500
...and honesty.

420
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,800
Yes

421
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,500
- What?
- Nothing.

422
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,500
LIMBO - PARTY

423
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,800
What are you doing here?

424
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,800
Hi Stefan!

425
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,500
Hi

426
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,800
Sorry, I hope I didn't disturb...

427
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,500
No, no problem. What are you doing here?
I thought you were in Berlin?

428
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,500
I'm visiting my parents, just for a few days.


429
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,500
Hello

430
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,500
Have a seat. You want a drink?

431
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,500
Water please.

432
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,500
- So what's up?
- I'm fine

433
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,500
- And you?
- Good, can't complain.

434
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,500
- Where is Kai?
- Still sleeping.

435
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,500
But you're still doing this together, right?

436
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,500
Sure, you know Kai. He needs attention. 

437
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,800
- Still so bad?
- Yea.

438
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,500
He smokes pot even when heâs on the toilet.
He said it's better for the digestion.

439
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,500
Thanks

440
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,500
You study law?
What's with your plans to open a beach cafÃ©?

441
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Ah forget that.
It was nonsense.

442
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,500
But you got it all checked out, 
just had to get on the plane...

443
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,500
I'll finish my education first. 
Then I will see what will be next. 

444
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,500
But it was always your thing. Going somewhere nice.
Sea, beach, palms, building up your own existence.

445
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,800
Well, tell me a little about you. How are you?

446
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,500
Excellent, the studies are going great. 
And I will go to London for my masters.

447
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,500
London?
Congratulations.

448
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,800
Thanks

449
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,500
And that's why I'm here. 
I wanna throw a little party...

450
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,500
...with the people from way back...
...you're invited of course...

451
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,500
...and I wanted to order some drugs from you.

452
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,800
What do you want to order?

453
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Drugs. You heard me.

454
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Drugs? You?
What for?

455
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,500
Excellent question.

456
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,500
Sure,
what do you want?

457
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,500
Schoof, bio-skunk, Superwahnsinn.
Mann, Mann, Mann, Mann!

458
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,500
Fitting for a good farewell party.

459
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,500
Aren't you afraid that you'll never leave this place?

460
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,500
Why? It's nice here.

461
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Three Superwahnsinn...

462
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,500
...bioskunk, schoof.

463
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,500
She knew a lot about drugs suddenly.

464
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,500
I just want you to question this strange metamorphosis.

465
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Shit, it's still full of greenflies.

466
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,500
Cause then you'd see that it was nothing but show.

467
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,500
- Fucking greenflies
- Just show

468
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,500
She only came to show me how great she turned out.

469
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,800
It's a scandal

470
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,500
And why? Because she still loves me.

471
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,500
That's a fact.
But she is without a chance.

472
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,500
Cheat on Gina because of her. That's totally crazy.

473
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,500
Oh come on, you've been nagging about that all day.

474
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,500
What? Sorry that I am talking about something personal for once.

475
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,500
That's not the point. I believe that you wouldn't cheat.

476
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,500
So what are we talking about?

477
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,500
The thing is that I could cheat.

478
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,500
I mean I am not, but I could be.

479
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,500
But I don't think that I am asking for too much...

480
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,500
...when I want you to show some interest in my situation.

481
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,500
So, why is there the possibility that you might cheat on her?

482
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
Well...

483
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,500
...Gina is pretty cool

484
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,500
But Jenny also has advantages.

485
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,800
- Sex!
- Sex.

486
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,500
- For example.
- Aha.

487
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,500
Jenny, she was terrific in bed.

488
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,500
...but with Gina...
...I didn't even get a boner in the beginning.

489
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Whyâs that?

490
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,500
That is exactly what I am trying to tell you.

491
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Jenny I met at the night club, right?
And she's always more of a fashionable girl.

492
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,500
But Gina...I knew her before already...

493
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,500
and she was a friend.
That is the problem.

494
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,500
The transition between friend and sex object.

495
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,500
Imagine you go out and have fun 
and afterwards you're in bed and she is giving you a blow job.

496
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,500
Would you let a friend suck your dick?

497
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,500
If he is pretty.

498
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,500
You're killing me. Stop it.

499
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,500
But are you getting the problem?

500
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,500
You see why there is at least one reason to cheat?

501
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,500
- Yea alright but you're not going to.
- Yes of course not.

502
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,500
Well then everything is alright, christ!

503
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,500
Asshole!
Come on.
Pussy!

504
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,500
Asshole, give it to me! 
Boner!

505
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,500
Achim my friend. I have to say
your strange flies...

506
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,500
...are just sunbathing and nothing else.

507
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,500
Sun? I thought you're growing indoors with a sunray lamp?!?

508
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,300
Sunray lamp?
These aren't just two plants in the bathroom...

509
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,500
...for our crops you don't need a sunray lamp,
you need an entire galaxy.

510
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,800
- I see
- Yes

511
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,500
Well outdoors these flies won't help.
In that case we need a new strategy.

512
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,500
He's harmless.

513
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,500
Limboooooooooo!!!

514
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,500
Hey!
How low can you go?!?!?!

515
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,500
Hey!
How low can you go?!?!?!

516
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,500
So what now?

517
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,800
- For me?
- You want one?

518
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,500
Thanks. Cheers.

519
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,500
Back in the days we never partied together like that

520
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,500
Back then you were different.

521
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,800
Friends?

522
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,500
Friends?!?!

523
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,500
Thanks

524
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,500
Are you alright?

525
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,500
No, nothing is alright.

526
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,800
I don't get it.

527
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,500
Kai, do I have...

528
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,800
...cellulitis...?

529
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,500
No, you're a top class woman.
That's not the reason.

530
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,500
You can't get a boner, and my
ex-boyfriend gets a blowjob from his vacuum cleaner.

531
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,500
Great "top class woman"

532
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Did you never get it, who was the reason 
why all my relationships didn't work out?.

533
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,500
I never wanted to tell you that.
Sorry.

534
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,500
What are you afraid of, Kai?

535
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,500
I'm not afraid.

536
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,500
I just want things to stay the way they are.

537
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,500
Hey pussys!!! Limbo!!!
Shit!!!

538
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,500
You can go.

539
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,500
Really?

540
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,500
Seriously?!?!

541
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,500
Is there anything left to smoke?

542
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,500
Mann, Mann, Mann, Achim

543
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,500
Sleeping bags are in the hallway. I'm going to sleep.
Good night.

544
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,500
Did you see that look she gave me?

545
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,500
Honesty...true loyalty...

546
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,500
Jenny! Can I come in?

547
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,500
That thing between us never really stopped, right?

548
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,500
I got a headache.

549
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,800
Good morning

550
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,500
Good morning. Get out of my bed now.

551
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,500
Breakfast

552
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,500
THE ZERO-ZERO DISASTER

553
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,500
"Hit him with full strength. That hurt."

554
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,500
"Gets the ball just like that."

555
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,500
You really want to take Achim to the plantation?

556
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,500
Well we hardly know the guy.

557
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,500
Are you afraid he's gonna turn us in, or what?.

558
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,500
That huge plantation can get us into jail.

559
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,500
Don't be silly. Achim smokes more than the both of us together,
plus he knows about growing. 

560
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,500
Shit! Always the same, you distracted me with your damn paranoia.

561
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,800
Some people just can't lose.

562
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,800
"Some people just can't lose."

563
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,800
- Want another zero-zero?
- Come on one more.
- One more and I kick your ass.

564
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,500
Did you manipulate something about the level?

565
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,500
Who is that now?

566
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,500
Damn, it's my father! Quick!

567
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,500
Hello Kai

568
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,500
Hey daddy

569
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,500
It smells sweet in here.

570
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,500
It's just this stuff, the air was bad.

571
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,800
So how is your stomach?

572
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,800
Much better already, thanks.

573
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,500
I see

574
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,800
Optimistic for your exam?

575
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,500
Yea, yea the stomach thing was a little problematic.
But I'll be alright.

576
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,500
You have to work hard now.
Life is not one big party.

577
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,500
By the way, Dr. Kollmann is coming over for dinner the night after tomorrow.
He runs the biggest office in town.

578
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,800
Kollmann, yea I know, of course.

579
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,500
Maybe you can drop by?
He might be able to do something for you.

580
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,500
A little "vitamin B", can't be bad to get some contacts...

581
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,500
Stefan! What the hell?
What's that?

582
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,500
Just stomach medicine. It's really...

583
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,500
I started feeling sick again.

584
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,500
I think I drank 10 liters of water already.

585
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,500
- Did it work?
- Apparently

586
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,500
Good hint with the water.
I don't feel anything so far.

587
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,500
The cops busted Dopex with 2 grams of cocaine in his car.

588
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,500
What? I knew it. I knew it!
Shit!

589
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,500
Dopex, remember? 
The guy I showed you at the party.

590
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,500
Yea I remember.

591
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,500
Stefan, what are you doing?

592
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,500
Are you nuts?
Our entire supply.

593
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,500
You flushed 1 kg gourmet dope down the toilet.

594
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,500
Dopex got busted. 
If he tells them names they are going to search our place.

595
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,800
What then?

596
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,500
Just shut up.
You messed everything up.

597
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,500
Of course you don't care. You get all your money from mommy.

598
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,500
But I'm gonna be somebody. I'll be a lawyer.

599
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,500
And I don't want to end up 
like the two retards out there in the bus!

600
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,500
- Nice start Bullmann!
- It's nothing compared to that home delivery service.

601
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,800
Possible, but you have to get us evidence.

602
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,500
A few grams from the pocket are not enough.

603
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,500
Bring real bulletproof evidence.

604
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,500
The more the better.

605
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,500
- So you want to follow in your fathers footsteps?
- I think so.

606
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,500
Well that is a challenge.
Your fathers career is quite impressing.

607
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,500
May I introduce you to my daughter Laura?

608
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,500
- Hello
- Good evening

609
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,500
Are you insane?

610
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,500
I'm sorry, just a nervous reflex...

611
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,500
I think I will specialize in criminal law.

612
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,500
I know it's pretty crowded, 
but it's a chance to get ahead quickly. 

613
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,500
Very determined, I like that.

614
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,500
- Is your girlfriend doing law too?
- Hmm?

615
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,500
If you have a girlfriend.

616
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,500
Gina does economics,
she is abroad right now.

617
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,500
She is..uhm...she is in the USA.
Doing an internship, for 3 months.

618
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,500
Gina is very hard working.
She gets things done.

619
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,800
- Mama!
- What is it?

620
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,800
- I wanna go play.
- Ok.

621
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,500
Your father told me you finance your studies by yourself?

622
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yea he works in a pizzeria.
Seems to be a well paying business.

623
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,500
You should see the car he is driving.

624
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,500
So where do you see yourself in 5 years?

625
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,800
Well, uhm...

626
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,800
...we'll see...

627
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,500
Don't be so shy!
He always wanted to be a lawyer.

628
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,500
- Not easy.
- But if you really want it you can do it.

629
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,500
The most important thing is to have clear goals in life.

630
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,500
And for you the only goal can be an excellent degree.

631
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,500
And then you can come to my office.

632
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
When will you be ready?

633
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,500
Takes a little longer.

634
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,500
- What semester are you in now?
- 10th

635
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,500
He is doing his exam now.

636
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,500
- Then it's about time for you now, eh?
- Hmm

637
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,500
Stefan! You wanna go get some fresh air?

638
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,500
I'll open the window.

639
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,500
- What is it with you?
- Stefan! Talk to us!

640
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,500
Stefan!

641
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,800


642
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,500
Take that brat away.
That's not a child it's the devil.

643
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,500
What are you talking about?

644
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,500
THE BRAIN CELL MASSACRE

645
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,500
Didn't they look different in the mushroom book?

646
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,800
You were supposed to look them up.

647
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,500
small...white lamella,...
...that should do it.

648
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,500
- That is just the right approach for picking mushrooms.
- Come on, we had the best dope in town, and now all we got are...

649
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,500
...these instant mushrooms.

650
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,500
Mushrooms on a pizza, nobody will bust us for that...

651
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,500
...the best future investment.

652
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,500
I hope they kick in.

653
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,500
We can test them.

654
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,500
That is being used in Kazachian plantations.

655
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,500
So don't get your noses too deep into it.

656
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,500
Why?

657
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,800
You know what the Polish call that stuff?

658
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,800
Brain cell massacre

659
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,800
"Brain cell massacre"?

660
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,500
Oh by the way...

661
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,500
Kai and I had some of these earlier.

662
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,500
A little more life enhancement for the garden work.

663
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,500
I can solve your greenfly problem.

664
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,500
Apart from that, great plants.

665
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,800
- Let's harvest
- What?

666
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,500
Look at the high stand. It's too obvious, 
Itâs a miracle nobody has discovered the crops yet.

667
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,500
- what are you talking about?
If we wait 2 weeks longer...

668
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,800
...we will have 30% more 
- I don't care

669
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,500
- Are you nuts? What's your problem?
- We harvest

670
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,800
And why did Achim bring the brain cell massacre?

671
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,500
I made a choice, spontaneous. The crops have to go.

672
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,500
Spontaneous. Spontaneous you also destroyed all our supplies.

673
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,500
That's nonsense
Right Achim? Right?

674
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,800
Say something, man.

675
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,500
That's your choice.
You can harvest now if you want.

676
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,500
"Well we can harvest if we want" great.

677
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,500
Well alright, let's harvest.

678
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,500
Was there something?

679
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,800
There was something. Be quiet.

680
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,500
I can't hear anything. Stop your damn paranoia!

681
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,500
Hello?

682
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,500
Stefan! Stefan!

683
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,800
I don't know what's going on with him.

684
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,800
- There is a hunter
- Shut up

685
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,500
What's going on with you?

686
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,500
- Small white lamella should do it, eh?
- Sorry, little mistake.

687
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,500
- "A little mistake?
- Yes, sorry.

688
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,500
- Keep his mouth closed.
- No he's spitting.

689
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,500
Stefan, Stefan! I can't hold him back.

690
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,800
The brain cell massacre

691
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,500
Stefan, no. You can't do that!

692
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,500
It's dangerous! Who knows what it'll do to him!
You can't do that man!

693
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,800
Hello?

694
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,500
Oh Shit.
Hide him.

695
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,500
Hello?

696
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,500
Everything alright?

697
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,500
- He puked up the mushrooms?
- Yes, but who knows what the brain cell massacre is still doing to him.

698
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,500
- Let's get him to a hospital.
- Yes
- I'll get the rest.

699
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,800
Freeze

700
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,500
Calm down. It's not what you think.

701
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,500
One move and I shoot.

702
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,800
- Are you crazy?
- Put him in the car.

703
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,800
We can't, we need the car for Achim.

704
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,500
He saw the dope. Put him in the trunk.

705
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,800
Look what you've done.

706
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,500
Always the same shit.

707
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,800
Shouldn't we bring them to the hospital?

708
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,500
To the hospital?
When he wakes up he will remember everything.

709
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,500
- We gotta get rid of the hunter somehow.
- Get rid of? You wanna kill him or what?

710
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,500
Are you completely crazy now?
This ain't no damn gangster movie.

711
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,500
Hey you said we should get rid of him,
I said we bring him to the hospital.

712
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,800


713
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,500
- You know what I mean.
- No I don't

714
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,500
I don't know how to get rid of somebody 
without getting rid of him.

715
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,500
Kai. Shut up now, I have to think.

716
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,500
"And here are the results of the Bundesliga games:
SC Freiburg - Werder Bremen 2:1...

717
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,500
...Borussia Dortmund - 1860 MÃ¼nchen 1:3...

718
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,500
...Bayer Leverkusen loses against FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen 0:3,
all three goals were scored by Mehmet Scholl..."

719
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,500
Mehmet is pretty hot at the moment, eh?

720
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,500
...Mehmet......hot.

721
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,500
No no, Mehmet is not hot, Mehmet is glowing.

722
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,500
They are thinking about coating the stadium
with teflon so that he won't stick.

723
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:15,500


724
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,500
I think Mehmet is the only guy in the world...

725
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,500
...that I'd give a blow job.

726
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,800
Seriously

727
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,500
Mehmet has style, and he looks handsome.

728
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,500
...good legs, good body, good face...

729
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,500
I'm not saying that you won't do it, but...

730
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,500
...maybe Mehmet Scholl wouldn't be the only guy that you'd give a blowjob.

731
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,500
What? No, don't get me wrong...

732
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,500
...I'd never suck anybodies dick.

733
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,500
I'm only saying if....

734
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,500
...if then only Mehmet.

735
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,800
Ok, alright.

736
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,500
Imagine you'd really give him a blowjob.

737
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,500
And imagine his dick is really good.

738
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,500
You'd do it one, twice, three, four, five,...
probably ten times.

739
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,500
...but at the 11th time you'd hear this slight knocking...

740
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,500
...in your head...
....from the inside....

741
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,800
...and you know why?

742
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,500
- You'll tell me.
- Yea I'll tell you.

743
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,500
Because in your head lives a little man,...

744
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,500
...who knocks against your skull from the inside...

745
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,500
...harder and harder and harder.
Until it sounds as if he's hammering "BAM BAM"...

746
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,500
...against your synapses.

747
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,500
And when you raise your head between Mehmets legs for the 20th time...

748
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,500
...then you'll start listening to the little man...

749
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,500
...You'd listen, and you know what he says?
- What?

750
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,500
He'd say: "Stefan, listen Mehmets dick is pretty good,...

751
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,500
...but are you sure that it's really the best?"

752
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,800
Yea, you laugh. Aren't there much better...

753
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,500
...nicer and bigger dicks in the world?"

754
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,500
And you'd think, and at some point you'd do it...

755
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,500
...you'd suck them all. ...

756
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,500
...you'd suck the big, the small, the yellow, the black, the green, the red...
- Yea I got it!

757
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,500
Ok, alright. Then you'd suck them all,
always searching for the ultimate dick.

758
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,500
Going from one dick to another.

759
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,500
But the reason is not that you like sucking dick,
the reason is a different one, you know it?

760
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,500
The reason is the little man living in your head...

761
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,800
...the little "I'm never satisfied" man lives in your head...

762
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,500
cause you're never happy with what you have
or what you're doing.

763
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,500
- Awesome theory.
- Yea it's a fact.

764
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,500
With Jenny you can't smoke pot,
with Gina you can't fuck...

765
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,500
...when we're sitting in the pizzeria you should be studying.

766
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,500
When we're together getting stoned you always think about your studies.

767
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,500
The little "I'm never satisfied" man is sitting in your head...

768
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,500
...and therefore Mehmet Scholls' dick 
would never be the only one you'd suck.

769
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,500
- Awesome thanks.
- You're welcome

770
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,500
You know sometimes I think...

771
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,500
...if I really would have done my beach cafe...

772
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,500
...and everything would have gone excellent...
...sun, beach, my own existence...

773
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,500
But then if you realize that you're still not happy.

774
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,500
That would be horrible.

775
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,500
So it's nice having an excuse for not being happy.

776
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,500
Yea it's also good to have an excuse for sucking dick.

777
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,500


778
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,500
Basically the only problem is that we don't have any problem.

779
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,500
Oh shit

780
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,500
Shit

781
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,500
Ok, stay cool.

782
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,500
Shit, it's over man.

783
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,500
Stay calm.

784
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,800
Step out of the car.

785
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,800
Alright guys.

786
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,500
If I search your glove compartment, what will I find?

787
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,500
Condoms or weed?

788
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,500
- Excuse me?
- What are two guys doing in the middle of the night
out on the fields?

789
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,500
Either they fuck or they smoke a joint.

790
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,500
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- It's alright guys.

791
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,500
I am ok with that.
Better to smoke a joint every now and then,...

792
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,500
...than getting drunk all the time.

793
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,500
- With dealers I have no mercy.
- That's right.

794
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,500
- But personal use is ok.
- Yes

795
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,500
- There you go
- Thanks

796
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,500
- Just open the trunk please.
- Why?

797
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,500
Just routine procedure.

798
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,500
Well I can tell you what's in there, 2 corpses and 3 kg drugs.

799
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,500
Oh that joke is old.

800
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,500
You fucking pigs!

801
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,800
Fucker

802
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,500
- I'm sorry, he can't help it.
- Pig pussys!

803
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,500
- He's got one of these mental disorders.
- Touretteâs, right?

804
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,500
- Exactly
- Doesn't he have his pills?

805
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,500
He forgot them at home.
((Gay dogs!))

806
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,800
I told him to take them but he forgot.
((Asshole, you monkey dicks!))


807
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,500
He should take them quickly.

808
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,500
I hope it's no problem with insulting an officer?
((Fat pussys!))

809
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,500
No problem, he doesn't know what he's doing. 
Just like when you're completely drunk.

810
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,500
((Motherfuckers! Dirty damn Nazi-communists!))

811
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,500
Interesting, what is the blood alcohol limit for that?
((Pigs!))

812
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,500
Around 2 parts per thousand.
But now it's about time you take him home.

813
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,500
Ãugler!

814
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,500
"Nazi-communists. Motherfuckers."

815
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,500
"Nazi-communists. Motherfuckers."

816
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,500
"Gay dogs?"
Dude!

817
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,500
By the way, they gave me an idea.

818
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,500


819
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,500
And if he still remembers?
The cop didn't say anything about amnesia?

820
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,500
They won't believe him.

821
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,500
Plus they will think it's an excuse anyway, 
cause he got drunk and screwed things up.

822
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,800
The cops will find him in his car.

823
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,500
Off the road, and hammered drunk.

824
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,500
- They will find him??
- Sure, we will call anonymously.

825
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,500
Yea alright.

826
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,500
- Ok, put the head on your shoulder.
- Ok.

827
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,500
Fill him up.

828
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,500
- Open up.
- There you go.

829
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,500
- Did he swallow it?
- Don't know.

830
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,800
Ach, shit.

831
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,500
Once again. Further back with the head.
Further.

832
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,500
Open wide.

833
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,500
Yea now he's got it.

834
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,500
Shit, that's not working.

835
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,800
It's all going down the windpipe.

836
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,500
We have to put it in his gullet.

837
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,500
How's that gonna work?

838
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,500
Pick him up.

839
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,500
Which one is the gullet? Right or left?

840
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,500
How should I know? 
You can't stick a hose down his throat.

841
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,500
- Got any better idea?
- No but...no.

842
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,500
- Right or left?
- Don't know, right?

843
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,500
- Or maybe left?
- Come on pick a choice.

844
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,500
We divide the responsibility.
You tell me where and I stick it in.

845
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,500
- OK: right.
- Right it is.

846
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,500
- Or maybe left?
- Oh come on, just tell me where!

847
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,800
- Left
- Left?
- Yes left.

848
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,500
Left it is then.

849
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,500


850
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,500
- I didn't know unconscious people can puke.
- Yea they can. Bon Scott died choking on his own vomit.

851
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,500
The stomach should be empty now, right?

852
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,500
- Alright, right or left?
- Right.

853
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,500
- Who was Bon Scott anyway?
- The former singer of AC/DC.

854
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,500
- So, since when do you like AC/DC?
- I don't.

855
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,500
- 38% alcohol, is that 2 parts per thousand already?
- We better be sure.

856
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,500
So that was it?

857
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,500
Yes

858
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,500
Wanna smoke a joint?

859
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,500
- The crops are in the trunk?
- Yea we can take that.

860
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Alright guys. Narcotics Division.

861
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,500
THE UNMASKING

862
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,500
I can remember a game where Mehmet got disqualified...

863
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,500
...he really provoked it. Saw a yellow card but he just didn't stop...

864
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,500
And when Bayern receives a goal. 
He just kicked down his opponent from behind and gets the red card.

865
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,800
And what does Mehmet do?

866
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,500
Mehmet calms down immediately.

867
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,500
He leaves the field without protest and accepts his punishment.
Cause he just knows that he went too far this time.

868
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,500
Ok, now we got a serious problem.

869
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,500
- Open the trunk.
- No.
- That's a police officer.

870
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,500
Exactly, and if you let him out we go to jail. Stop it.

871
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,500
It's through, it's over.
I can't stand this anymore!

872
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,500
Stefan! Don't panic, first...

873
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,500
Stop it!
First we see what options we have, ok?

874
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,500
Options? What options do we have left?

875
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,500
You're nuts, we're not going to do this.

876
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,500
We agree that we can't hurt him right?

877
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,500
So we got only one option.
We have to talk to a professional lawyer.

878
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,500
A judge. A judge like your father, 

879
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,500
who would do everything to get his son out of this shit.

880
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,500
- Completely normal, eh?
- I won't do it. I'm not going in there. We won't do that!

881
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,500
OK, listen.

882
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,500
It's the 90th minute. We're one goal down.
The damn game is pretty much lost.

883
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,500
We have only one last chance.
If we take that we might make it to overtime, ok?

884
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,800
Maybe we get a fucking golden goal. 
Then we still have only lost...

885
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,500
...but you just want to wait here for the whistle?

886
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,500
I tell you one thing: Mehmet would have tried.

887
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,500
Are you not getting this?

888
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,500
We're sitting here. Back in the trunk is....

889
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,500
...and you have the nerves to come up 
with a fucking golden goal theory?

890
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,800
Don't you get it that this is exactly the bullshit that got us here?

891
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,800
What do you mean by that?

892
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,500
I mean all this hanging around. Talking "stylish" nonsense, smoking pot all the time...

893
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,800
All that "cool" bullshit.

894
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,500
Listen, we're not cool.
You and me are not cool.

895
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,500
We're two losers hanging out in a crappy pizzeria...

896
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,800
...dilettantes dealing dope...

897
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,500
...and having our lives completely messed up now.

898
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,500
Man, we could have killed him.

899
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,800
You..you're not getting it.

900
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,500
You little ignorant loudmouth, you just don't get it.

901
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,500
You don't get it.

902
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,500
I just can't believe that I joined you in your bullshit for all that time.

903
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,500
Did I force you into anything?

904
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,500
You could have left at any time. No problem.

905
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,500
So don't blame me alone for all that shit, ok?

906
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,300
You're a coward.

907
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:24,500
You want to change your life? Go ahead change it.

908
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,500
You're always whining. Always complaining about things,...

909
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,500
...about Franka, about SchÃ¶ngeist, 
and how fucked up they are.

910
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,500
You're right, but you know what?

911
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
They are fucked up, but with conviction.

912
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And therefore they have a thousand times more class than you,
because they believe in what they're doing.

913
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,800
and you?

914
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,500
You still sit here whining around instead of getting up off your ass.

915
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,500
Seems like you're not getting that. They'll put you away.

916
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,500
Going to jail. Picture that.

917
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:60,500
You think daddy will finally be proud of you then?

918
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,500
Alright boys. Tell me what happened.

919
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,500
Well...

920
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,500
The pizzeria, where we work...

921
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,500
Is not really about pizza...

922
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,500
...that is just a cover.

923
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,500
In fact we sell drugs from there.

924
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,500
...hash, marihuana...
- ...bioskunk...

925
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,500
...anything...

926
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,500
The customers order on the phone, and we deliver to their home.

927
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,500
No hard drugs, only cannabis products.

928
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,500
We sold so far...

929
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,500
...20 kilo altogether.
I guess.

930
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,500
A few weeks ago an undercover detective infiltrated our business.

931
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,500
- He didn't reveal his cover cause he wanted to get our sources.
- You know what that means?

932
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,500
Wait, that's not the whole truth yet.

933
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,500
Yesterday we took him to the plantation.

934
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,500
After we harvested about 3 kilo weed...

935
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,500
...he tried to bust us, in flagranti.

936
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,500
- Wait, there is still more.
- Of course, excuse me.

937
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,500
So when he wanted to bust us we grabbed him...

938
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,500
...and put him in the trunk of my BMW.

939
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,500
And he is still in there now.
And the car is parked outside in the driveway.

940
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,500
That's it.

941
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,500
I have an old friend back from my days as public prosecutor.

942
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,500
And how are you planning to keep your man quiet?

943
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,500
I threatened him with disciplinary proceedings.

944
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,500
Suppression of evidence, unlawful methods...

945
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,500
And if he still talks nobody will believe him.

946
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,500
You know how many black sheep we have in our own ranks.

947
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,500
- Again, thank you for everything.
- No problem

948
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,500
I have kids myself.

949
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,500
The 3 kilo? In the car? Good.

950
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:28,500
Dad really hauled him over the coals that night.
He said if he fails his exam all hell is gonna break loose.

951
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,500
Since then he completely seals himself off and studies.
I wonder how he is doing.

952
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,500
I called Gina a few days ago and told her that it's over.
She got an American guy now.

953
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,500
That slut.

954
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,500
He didn't keep in touch with you?

955
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,500
You may now start the exam.

956
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:04,800


957
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,500
Why don't you call him?

958
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,500
Want a shottie?

959
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,500
I got to deliver these, ok?

960
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,500
It's weird that I didn't have to think about my father.

961
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,500
Or about the fact that I now pick a so-called "choice for life".

962
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,500
No. When I slowly began to like the idea 
to just not finish the exam...

963
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,800
...I had to think about Kai...

964
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,500
...and the theories he would have made up 
about all these weirdos here.

965
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,500
They will say that I should have planned my departure
a little more spectacularly...

966
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,500
...rip up my paper or something.

967
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,500
But that would have been too theatrical.

968
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,500
You should always keep a certain style.

969
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,500
- Hi
- Hi

970
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,500
You know, I just happened to be in the area, so I thought...

971
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,500
That's nice

972
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,500
- Unfortunately I'm in a bit of a hurry.
- Why?

973
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,500
Gotta go home to pack my things. 
I want to go to the airport.

974
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,500
Seriously?

975
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,500
Well I can give you a ride, if you want.

976
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,500
Don't you want to cut it?

977
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,500
- Why?
- Well why do you think? I surely wasn't going to eat it.

978
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,500
By the way, you know what I read the other day?

979
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,500
Eleniak, you know?

980
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,500
She got fired in Baywatch only because,...

981
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,500
...cause she was nagging about Hasselhoff all the time...

982
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,800
Yea

983
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,500
- You were wrong man.
- Alright, ok.

984
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,500
- But I did it with style, right?
- That's right
