1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,300
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

2
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,580
Chris, what is it?

3
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,500
I love you so much.

4
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,940
Don't you love me any more?

5
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,660
I've made progress,
and I recognise that.

6
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,500
But my wife, who I can't
even convince to come here...

7
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,300
Anything can set her off.
It could be the phone ringing,

8
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,500
something on the news,
something online, going shopping maybe.

9
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,220
A commemorative T-shirt in the window.
Itjust puts her right back in that place,

10
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,380
and it's like all my progress - ripped away.
And I'm right back there with her.

11
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,700
I feel totally the opposite. I see the TV
and I see the Internet and I see those T-shirts

12
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,940
and I feel nothing. The more I see the images,
the less I feel, the less I believe that it's real.

13
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,180
I mean, I think I'm supposed to feel
something by now. Don't you think so?

14
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,580
Linda, this is Chris Kelvin.
I'm returning your call.

15
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,740
I have two times available this week;

16
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,780
7am on Tuesday
or 6.15pm on Thursday.

17
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,540
You can leave a message if either
of those times are good for you. Thank you.

18
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,340
Well, I know that's not true.

19
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,260
Because I know you, and I know it's not true.

20
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,100
Good. I'm glad.

21
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,980
All right.

22
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,180
Let's pick this up on Wednesday.

23
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,860
Can I help you?

24
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,380
<i>We're looking for Dr Chris Kelvin.</i>

25
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,420
<i>Chris...</i>

26
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,420
<i>I can't imagine what you must be
thinking, getting a message like this.</i>

27
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,380
<i>I apologise if it seems melodramatic, but
you are the only person I can... I can trust...</i>

28
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,860
<i>in the situation.</i>

29
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,500
<i>I need your help.</i>

30
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,260
<i>I need you to come to Solaris, Chris.</i>

31
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,300
<i>I don't know how to describe
what we are experiencing up here.</i>

32
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,780
<i>We can't even agree amongst ourselves
what is... what is happening, or...</i>

33
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,780
<i>what to do about it.</i>

34
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,380
<i>I suppose the... the most obvious
solution would be to leave.</i>

35
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,220
<i>But none of us want to. That's why
you're getting this... this bizarre request.</i>

36
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,260
<i>I...</i>

37
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,300
<i>I told the crew that your
background and experiences</i>

38
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,580
<i>made you the...
the ideal candidate for this job.</i>

39
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,020
<i>Don't worry. I didn't elaborate.</i>

40
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,460
<i>But it's true.</i>

41
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,180
<i>So, anyway...</i>

42
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,940
<i>I, uh... I hope you will come to Solaris, Chris.</i>

43
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,780
<i>I-I think you need to.</i>

44
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,180
<i>You will see what I mean.</i>

45
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,500
<i>I wish I could be more specific
about all of this, but... you know.</i>

46
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,780
<i>People are listening.</i>

47
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,300
You can imagine the distress
Dr Gibarian's message caused at DBA.

48
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,700
Why not send in the security force?

49
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,380
We did. We lost contact
as they were approaching Solaris.

50
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,100
They haven't returned.

51
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,100
There must be some
sort of on-board Al system.

52
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,140
They shut it down.

53
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,500
The company was hoping to solve
this problem without involving a civilian.

54
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,060
Obviously these are extreme circumstances.

55
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,900
Some preparation is involved
but you shouldn't have any trouble.

56
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,420
The flight itself is fully automated.
You'll be asleep most of the trip.

57
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:22,340
We feel confident that if you board
the ship, you can negotiate their safe return.

58
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,940
Is that what everybody wants?

59
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,660
Of course.

60
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,020
Find the probability of F.

61
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,380
OK, stop. Go back.

62
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,420
Snow.

63
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,460
Kelvin, is it?

64
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,380
Yeah.

65
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,340
Kelvin. Right. Oh, man.

66
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,860
Sorry about that, Kelvin.

67
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Names, you know, just...

68
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,460
For some reason. It, uh...

69
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,100
Yeah. Uh...

70
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,380
Well, uh, you wanna come in?

71
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,700
I'm fine.

72
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,860
Whose blood is that, leading to the lab?

73
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,500
Yeah. Blood.

74
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,980
How 'bout that?

75
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,900
Katarn.

76
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,020
He, um... Yeah.

77
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,180
Security forces showed up
and he just took off, and they...

78
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,660
Yeah. Put a hole in his pot.

79
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,660
What happened to Gibarian?

80
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,620
Yeah.

81
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,660
It was a suicide.

82
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,380
Who found him?

83
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,540
I found him.

84
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,900
What happened to Rhys?

85
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,620
Yeah, now, Rhys w... Huh.

86
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,940
We don't know, because the thing is,
he kind of... disappeared.

87
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,940
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared.

88
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,660
- How did he disappear?
- Exactly.

89
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,220
Don't know. We do know
that he's not on the ship, uh,

90
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,620
and that's... that's all we know.

91
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,220
Where's Dr Gordon?

92
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,940
Dr Gordon. She is in her room,

93
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,860
and, um...

94
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,380
Dr Gordon won't let you in her room.

95
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,940
Can you tell me what's happening here?

96
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,740
I could tell you what's happening,

97
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,620
but, uh...

98
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,380
I don't know if that'd
really tell you what's happening.

99
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,060
I just wanna talk to you.

100
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,780
You have to give me your word
you won't try to come in.

101
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,100
All right.

102
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,660
Well?

103
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,620
- What happened to Gibarian?
- Didn't you talk to Snow?

104
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,140
- I wanted to hear your version.
- There isn't any version.

105
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,140
He killed himself.

106
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,980
Why haven't you come home?
What happened here?

107
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,100
What did you find?

108
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,140
- Who are you representing?
- I'm the last effort to recover this mission,

109
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,060
before they abandon this ship
and everyone on board.

110
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,660
Until it starts happening to you,
there's really no point in discussing it.

111
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,620
Hey.

112
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,860
Hey!

113
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,580
<i>- Who else is here?
- Who else is here?</i>

114
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,300
<i>I saw a boy.</i>

115
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,020
Gibarian's son.

116
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,700
- Michael.
- How is that possible?

117
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,980
I think that's why you're here.

118
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,820
I want a formal interview with you
and Gordon. I'll need your help with her.

119
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,420
Yeah. All right.

120
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,700
Um...

121
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,180
How much sleep do you need, Kelvin?

122
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,820
- How much sleep?
- Yeah.

123
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,740
- How long can you go without sleep?
- Depends.

124
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,860
Well,

125
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,340
when you do go to sleep,

126
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,540
I find I sleep much better
with the door locked.

127
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,380
<i>I was with the project when it was
still with NASA, before it was sold to DBA.</i>

128
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,580
I was trained in physics.

129
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,260
I was sent here to assess
the economic potential of Solaris.

130
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,140
Whether or not it was a viable commercial
property or possible energy source.

131
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,460
I was still compiling data
when this shit started happening.

132
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,380
Did you run any tests
on the food, air, water?

133
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:56,220
I checked it 50 times. There are no signs of
contaminants or psychotropic compounds.

134
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,300
How about you? How are you doing?

135
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,980
Depression.

136
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,820
Along with bouts of hypomania
and primary insomnia.

137
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,700
Suggestions of agoraphobia,
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

138
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,980
shock, fatigue, denial...

139
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,940
- Not unusual, given the circumstances.
- I know.

140
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:26,060
All right. Now, what can you tell me
about what's happening here?

141
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,580
Just that I want it to stop,
but I want to stop it.

142
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,100
If I can stop it that means
I'm smarter than it is.

143
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,020
You know you can go home,
walk away from all of this.

144
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,140
I can guarantee it.

145
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,580
Yeah.

146
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,540
The thing is... Man, I would kill
to go back there. I'd... kill.

147
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,220
But Gordon?

148
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,140
Gordon happens to be Gordon, you know?

149
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,820
So, um...

150
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,860
But I'll see what I can do.

151
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,380
<i>We take off into the cosmos.</i>

152
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,740
<i>Ready for anything -
solitude, hardship, exhaustion...</i>

153
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,060
<i>death.</i>

154
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,220
<i>We're proud of ourselves.</i>

155
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,940
<i>But when you think about it,
our enthusiasm's a sham.</i>

156
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,740
<i>We don't want other worlds. We want mirrors.</i>

157
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,540
So, anyway... How's the spawn?

158
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,180
Oh, good, good. He cries
and shits in his pants every two hours.

159
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,900
- I know the feeling.

160
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,020
When are you leaving?

161
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,780
- We've been postponed again.
- I didn't hear that.

162
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,660
Nobody knows yet.

163
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,100
The governments are looking for a buyer. I
wish we could tell people what's happening.

164
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,460
You can tell me. I'm a doctor.

165
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,500
Well, Doctor, as we study Solaris,

166
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,700
the most interesting thing is it, um...

167
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,460
Well, it seems to be reacting.
Almost like it knows it's being observed.

168
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,260
We can't explain it.

169
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,100
Are you listening to me? Chris?

170
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,380
- So anyway...
- So anyway. Sorry.

171
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,580
Go to her. Her name is Rheya. She's a bit
tricky but, um, I guess she's worthwhile.

172
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,780
Maybe she needs a shrink.

173
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,420
Don't we all?

174
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,100
Don't blow it.

175
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,460
<i>You start.</i>

176
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
<i>I did.</i>

177
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,500
<i>Really?</i>

178
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,820
All right, I'm gonna resist the impulse
to ask you about the door knob.

179
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,220
- Do you always resist your impulses?
- Not always.

180
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,940
<i>Try poetry.</i>

181
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,140
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

182
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,980
<i>Mm. Thomas.</i>

183
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,500
<i>It's not a very happy poem, though.</i>

184
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:05,060
<i>Well, you didn't seem
very happy when I saw you on the train.</i>

185
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,460
<i>I wasn't.</i>

186
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,180
<i>And tonight?</i>

187
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,820
<i>It's early.</i>

188
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,780
Goddammit!

189
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,260
I'm awake.

190
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,780
Yes.

191
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,100
How are you here?

192
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,380
How are you here?

193
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,980
How do you mean?

194
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,740
Where do you think you are?
Where do you think you are right now?

195
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,220
At home.

196
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,340
Where is home?

197
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,780
With you, where we live.

198
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:09,900
And do you remember being anywhere else
with me? Being together anywhere else?

199
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,620
- Our apartment.
- Describe it.

200
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,540
It's dark. It's very very dark.

201
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,700
And there are no paintings on the wall.

202
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,220
No pictures anywhere.

203
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,900
No pictures on the fridge, even,
which I always thought was a bit strange.

204
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,380
Do you remember
where we first saw each other?

205
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,100
On a train.

206
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,260
Chris...

207
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,100
I'm so happy to see you.

208
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,780
I love you so much.

209
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,460
Don't you love me any more?

210
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,820
I have to check out something with the crew.

211
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,620
No! No!

212
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,820
- Don't leave me! Don't leave me!
- Why? Why?

213
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,540
- Why?
- I don't know.

214
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,500
I don't know.

215
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,420
It's OK.

216
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,140
It's OK.

217
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,260
Why are you sitting over there?

218
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,820
Can I come and sit with you?

219
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,820
Hey.

220
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,700
What was that?

221
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,140
Yeah.

222
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,580
How 'bout that?

223
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,620
Still workin' on that.

224
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,060
Where's your visitor?

225
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,780
I don't know. Stopped appearing.

226
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,780
- Who's your visitor?
- My brother.

227
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,180
Who was it?

228
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,900
My wife.

229
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,860
Dead?

230
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,860
So what was her name?

231
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,460
Will she come back?

232
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,260
Do you want her to?

233
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,540
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

234
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,700
- No, it isn't. It's crap.
- Only one way to find out.

235
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,100
You can submit it to someone
and see if they publish it.

236
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,540
That's not an indication of anything.

237
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,300
So no one else's opinion counts
except for yours?

238
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,780
- Yeah.
- That's insane.

239
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,220
- "That's" insane.
- I like it.

240
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,740
Brings out the red in my eyes.

241
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,220
So, did you show it to your father?

242
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,100
- Yeah.
- And?

243
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,700
- And he liked it.
- What'd he say?

244
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,900
- He said he liked it.
- Well...

245
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,740
He's a man who doesn't pass out
compliments very easily. That's something.

246
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,500
- What's that tell you?
- Can we talk about something else? Please?

247
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,020
All right. When do you wanna get hitched?

248
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,180
Every time I bring it up
you make ajoke about it, and...

249
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,500
I know, I know. That's pathet...
I'm sorry. It's just...

250
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,620
It-it's so difficult for me.

251
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,340
Still? Is it something that I'm not doing?

252
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,500
No. No, no, no. That's not the issue at all.

253
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,420
Because, you know,
if you keep putting this off,

254
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,660
then in 15 or 20 years
I'm just gonna stop asking.

255
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,020
- Well, I've got ages, then.
- Mm.

256
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,100
So apart from the poem that you
quoted to me the night that we met...

257
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,300
The night that you were hitting on me.

258
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,500
Oh, I don't think so.
What's your favourite poem?

259
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,180
My favourite Dylan Thomas poem?
Well, there's the, uh...

260
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,780
Listen to this. We have, uh... There's the...

261
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,380
Well, there's the one he's most famous for,

262
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,740
which starts, um...

263
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,300
- "There was a young man from Nantucket..."
- I knew it. I just...

264
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,700
I'm not marrying you.

265
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,020
You...

266
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,460
Oh, you're marrying me.

267
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,700
Would we have to invite anyone else?

268
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,060
There should be witnesses.

269
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,900
Otherwise nobody'd believe us.

270
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,700
<i>When I was little I had
this imaginary friend called Mikashelli,</i>

271
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,660
who used to live under the wallpaper
in the corner of the room.

272
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,740
I used to go and visit. I had a very
intense relationship. I was an only child.

273
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,340
As you know. And, um...
that was like my sibling.

274
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,060
That was the person I used to have
battles with and fights with and everything.

275
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,260
What happened progressively
over the next few years

276
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,020
is that my mother stopped
communicating with me.

277
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,380
She only communicated with me as
Mikashelli, and wrote me these letters,

278
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,740
and we didn't have conversations any more.

279
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,940
- I mean, admittedly, she was certifiable.
- Mm-hm.

280
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,140
But, um, yeah, that was
a strange way to grow up.

281
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,700
You know, you're with the right man.

282
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,740
I so know that. That's what's great.

283
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,460
Cos, man...

284
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,500
Rheya...

285
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,260
It's me.

286
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,980
It's me.

287
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,300
I don't remember that.

288
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,620
When did you get that?

289
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,860
I got it just before I came here.

290
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,060
- Was I with you?
- No.

291
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,540
I don't actually remember anything.

292
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,540
I only remember you.

293
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,740
Have I been ill?

294
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,540
Sort of.

295
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,300
And we've been apart?

296
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,220
- Yes.
- For how long?

297
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,140
A few years.

298
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,340
- Were you alone?
- Yes.

299
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,460
Was that difficult?

300
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,740
It was easier than being with someone else.

301
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,660
Did you think about me?

302
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,180
Yes.

303
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,460
What is that, out there?

304
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,420
Solaris.

305
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,100
Oh, my God, yes.

306
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,300
I can't remember how I got here.

307
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,620
Did I come here with you?

308
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,140
- I don't know how you got here.
- What do you mean?

309
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,940
I woke up and you were here.

310
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,860
So I wasn't here yesterday?

311
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,980
No.

312
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,540
Right.

313
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,180
<i>Getting dressed?</i>

314
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,540
People will notice tonight.

315
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,100
If you're not there, Rheya,

316
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,980
people will notice.

317
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,460
I can put up with all of it,
you know? The mood swings, the...

318
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,340
restlessness,

319
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:06,260
<i>changing jobs every three months, all of it.</i>

320
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,580
<i>What I can't put up with
is you hiding from me.</i>

321
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,620
Why do you do that?

322
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,740
Do you wanna be here?

323
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:27,220
Cos I need help. I can't do this...
I can't "continue" to do this on my own.

324
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,500
<i>The idea of God
was dreamed up by man.</i>

325
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,900
<i>A silly animal with a small brain.</i>

326
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,180
<i>Even the limits
that we put on it are human limits.</i>

327
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,980
- It designs, it creates...
- No, I'm talking about a higher intelligence.

328
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,220
No, hold it. You're talking about
something else - a man in a white beard.

329
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,740
Ascribing human characteristics
to something that isn't human.

330
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,980
Aren't we all?

331
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,540
Rheya, given all the elements
of the known universe and enough time,

332
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,940
our existence is inevitable.

333
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,580
It's no more mysterious than trees or sharks.

334
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,820
We're a mathematical probability,
and that's all.

335
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,740
How do you explain that
of all the creatures on this planet,

336
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,460
only we are conscious of our own mortality?

337
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,820
You can't explain that.
That doesn't mean there's a God.

338
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,460
Maybe religion has been bred into us.

339
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,700
The pope is a wonderful woman...

340
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,820
- Excuse me.
- A nihilistic shrink. Is there a school?

341
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,980
- Not yet.

342
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,060
You see? He's funny, at least.

343
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,980
Where you been?

344
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,300
Away from those fucking people.

345
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,860
<i>They're my friends.</i>

346
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,980
<i>Yeah.</i>

347
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,940
Chris, I've got to talk to you.

348
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,140
What's wrong?

349
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,020
I don't understand what's happening.

350
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,260
And if I do understand what's happening
then I don't think I can handle it.

351
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,580
What do you mean?

352
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,260
I mean...

353
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,220
I mean...

354
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,500
I'm not the person I remember.

355
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,940
Or at least I'm not sure I am.

356
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:16,660
I mean, I-I do remember things,
but I don't remember being there.

357
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,420
I don't remember experiencing those things.

358
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,900
My... I...

359
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,460
I mean, I'm really really...

360
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,100
really really trying to understand.

361
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,140
And-and these, uh...

362
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,540
These... these strange thoughts
keep coming into my head, and I...

363
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,100
I don't know where they're
coming from, and I'm scared.

364
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,460
Um...

365
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,780
And I-I don't know what's happening.
I-I don't know what's happening.

366
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,500
- What do you think's happening?
- You need rest.

367
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,260
- No...
- Take that.

368
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,140
You don't understand. Because
I don't think that I can live with this.

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,820
I don't understand what is happening now.

370
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:08,980
I mean, this-this-this... I remember this.
I have a memory of it. But...

371
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,100
<i>But I don't. I don't remember
seeing it. I don't...</i>

372
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,700
I don't remember being there. I...

373
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,540
Rheya, it's fatigue. It's fatigue.
It's brought on by stress.

374
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,140
It's fatigue. That's why you take this.

375
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,100
Right. Yeah.

376
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,020
No, it is. You'll be fine. I'll talk to Gordon
and Snow. We'll go back to Earth.

377
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,180
- Mm-hm.
- And you're gonna be fine.

378
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,820
Mm-hm.

379
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,980
Mm.

380
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,460
- I'm coming right back.
- Right.

381
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,380
- Are you gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,900
Yeah.

383
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,580
This door locks from the inside.

384
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,380
- Yeah.
- You'll be perfectly safe in here.

385
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,060
Yeah.

386
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,700
You sure you're gonna be all right?

387
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,980
You-you keep asking me that,
actually. Yes. Yeah.

388
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,020
I'm fine. I'm fine.

389
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,140
Stay here.

390
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,260
<i>I was so worried, man.</i>

391
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,460
About this guy. But then you show up,
and I'm even more-more worried about you.

392
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,860
Particularly after the first...
when you sent the first one away.

393
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,060
Yeah, you were pretty...

394
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,820
Pretty, uh... You deserved to be
as freaked out as you were.

395
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:58,700
She can never know anything
about that. Ever. You understand?

396
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,620
No, no, no, no, no.

397
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,940
I wonder if they can get pregnant.

398
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,660
<i>Where are you going?</i>

399
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,300
<i>- I can't be here.
- What?</i>

400
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,460
<i>You should have told me.</i>

401
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,820
- It wouldn't have made any difference.
- Really?

402
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,300
Chris, I had to!

403
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,420
Obviously I had to. You know that about me.

404
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,860
I had no idea you'd react like this. Listen!

405
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Listen to me.

406
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,220
<i>What's changed?
I didn't even know you wanted one.</i>

407
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,820
Yeah, why would I want one?
Why would I want a child,

408
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,340
or anything that would
bring life into this house?!

409
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,620
- No, no, Chris. No. No.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

410
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,500
Stop it! Stop it!

411
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,100
No, Chris, you don't understand.

412
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,660
You have to understand. I had no idea you
felt like that. I won't make it without you.

413
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,380
- Then you won't make it.
- Chris, no, please!

414
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,780
- Let go of me!
- No...

415
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,460
No!

416
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,180
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

417
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,100
<i>Oh, no.</i>

418
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,100
You wanna change Gordon's mind.
What if Gordon and your wife, right,

419
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,820
your very nice wife... She's nice, right?
Of course she's nice. Your wife is nice.

420
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,780
They get together, right?
Cos I'm thinkin'... women, right?

421
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,620
Right now we got woman and woman, right?

422
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,940
If we get "women", you know, together on the
same team and all that shit, what happens?

423
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,620
You know what happens.
All kinds of shit you can't explain happens.

424
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,020
Like the... But good shit, you know?

425
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,100
Mysterious, but good. Usually very good.
Things get solved, you know?

426
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,420
That's my plan, you know?
What do you... think?

427
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,500
I'll have to think about that.

428
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,500
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

429
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,460
<i>"Dead men naked, they shall be one</i>

430
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,340
<i>With the man in the wind
and the west moon."</i>

431
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,900
<i>"When their bones are picked clean
and the clean bones gone,</i>

432
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,500
<i>They shall have stars at elbow and foot."</i>

433
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,940
<i>"Though they go mad they shall be sane."</i>

434
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,620
<i>"Though they sink through the sea
they shall rise again."</i>

435
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,220
<i>"Though lovers be lost love shall not."</i>

436
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,900
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

437
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,220
You found me.

438
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,260
I came back for you.

439
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,580
I came back that day.

440
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:41,060
I'm sorry.

441
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,380
<i>All right. Enough hypothesising.</i>

442
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:59,220
The visitors. Are they or are they not
made of subatomic particles?

443
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,380
Subatomic particles... I'm not sure.

444
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,460
What do you think?

445
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,860
I think... probably.

446
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,940
Stabilised by what?

447
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,140
Guess.

448
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,460
I don't know. Maybe... a Higgs field.

449
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,220
So...

450
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,260
if we created a negative Higgs field and
bombarded them with Higgs antibosons

451
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,660
they might disintegrate?

452
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,180
Maybe. You know,
it would take a lot of power.

453
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,380
Shut down all
the noncritical ship functions.

454
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,900
This is just a theory,
you know? We could be wrong.

455
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,940
- Let's find out.
- We'll take the findings back to Earth.

456
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,820
What if they follow us back?

457
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,500
What if what's happening here
happened on Earth on a mass scale?

458
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,900
Don't you see that as a problem?

459
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,780
I think it's a serious mistake
to assume it's benign.

460
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,980
It's driving us crazy
so it can watch us kill each other.

461
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,780
Is that really why you think they're here?

462
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:06,340
Given its resources it could have
done anything, including destroy us.

463
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,380
Meet me in the lab in an hour.

464
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,460
- I won't let you.
- How you gonna stop us?

465
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,500
- How you gonna stop me taking her back?
- Shall we pick up the other one on the way?

466
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,180
Shouldn't be too hard. We could
chart its course. Only take a day or so.

467
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,860
Chris, what's she talking about?

468
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,300
- Nothing.
- Her oxygen might have run out.

469
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,820
Maybe they don't need any.

470
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,140
Chris, what are they talking about?

471
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,300
You didn't tell her?

472
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,660
Tell me what?

473
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,740
Tell me what?

474
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,620
- You came before.
- He got rid of you.

475
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,860
You what?

476
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,580
I sent you away.

477
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,900
Into space.

478
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,420
Oh, my God.

479
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,740
Oh, my God.

480
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,420
No. Rheya...

481
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,700
Don't touch me.

482
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,380
Rheya, I didn't understand.

483
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,540
Rheya. Rheya. Hey.

484
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,740
- Don't.
- No. No. No. Don't.

485
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:13,260
What were you trying to
accomplish with that, exactly?

486
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,860
Kelvin...

487
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,260
It is a mistake to become
emotionally engaged with one of them.

488
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,980
You're being manipulated.

489
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,580
If she were ugly, you wouldn't want her
around. That's why she's not ugly.

490
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,420
She's a mirror that reflects part
of your mind. You provide the formula.

491
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,340
- She's alive.
- She is not human.

492
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,300
Try to understand that,
if you can understand anything.

493
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:51,060
What about your visitor? The one you're
so ready to destroy without hesitation?

494
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,380
Who is it? "What" is it?

495
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,500
Does it feel? Can it touch?

496
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,420
Does it speak?

497
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,220
We are in a situation
that is beyond morality. Hm?

498
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,980
Your wife is dead.

499
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:14,500
How do you know? How can you be definitive
about a construct you do not understand?

500
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,300
She's a copy. A facsimile.

501
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,740
And she's seducing you all over again.

502
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,620
You're sick.

503
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:32,060
We are not taking her back with us.

504
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,260
Leave the light off.

505
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,220
You think you're dreaming me.

506
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,380
You're not Gibarian.

507
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,180
No?

508
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,460
Who am I, then?

509
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,340
- A puppet.
- And you're not?

510
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,900
Well, maybe you're my puppet.

511
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,740
But like all puppets,
you think you're actually human.

512
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:23,460
That's the puppet's dream - being human.

513
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,140
Why did you kill yourself?

514
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:35,060
It seemed like a good idea
at the time. Now I think I made a mistake.

515
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:39,540
- What about your son?
- That's not my son. My son is on Earth.

516
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:46,060
And that's not your wife.
They are part of Solaris. Remember that.

517
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,180
What does Solaris want from us?

518
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,700
Why do you think it has to want something?

519
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:01,540
This is why you have to leave.
If you keep thinking there is a solution...

520
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,100
you'll die here.

521
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,100
I can't leave her.

522
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,540
I'll figure it out.

523
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,580
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

524
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,140
There are no answers.

525
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:19,020
Only choices.

526
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,900
Rheya?

527
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,860
Rheya?

528
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,660
Rheya?

529
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:24,100
Rheya?

530
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,540
Gordon!

531
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:17,020
- What happened?
- She drank liquid oxygen.

532
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,020
She's dead.

533
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,580
No.

534
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:12,900
I never get used to them.
These... resurrections.

535
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,340
Oh, no.

536
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,180
No.

537
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,180
Why'd you do that?

538
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,140
Rheya?

539
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:31,220
Don't call me that.

540
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,740
<i>There are two components.</i>

541
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:46,820
A high-energy proton accelerator
and a matter phase modulator.

542
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:52,820
By adjusting the tuning frequency I get an
enhancement of Higgs antibosons at 90GHz

543
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:56,980
and an almost pure beam at 160GHz.

544
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:01,060
I used it on mine.

545
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,060
What happens?

546
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,140
They disappear,
back where they came from.

547
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,980
It's what she wants.

548
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:19,220
I won't let her do it.

549
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,780
She'll come to me when you're asleep.

550
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,340
Then I won't sleep.

551
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,860
<i>Don't you see?
I came from your memory of her.</i>

552
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,100
<i>That's the problem. I'm not a whole person.</i>

553
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,820
In your memory
you get to control everything.

554
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:47,540
So even if you remember something wrong,
I am predetermined to carry it out.

555
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,100
I'm suicidal because
that's how you remember me.

556
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,660
My voice sounds the way it does
because that's how you remember it.

557
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,060
I don't believe that we're
predetermined to relive our past.

558
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:03,540
I think that we can choose to do it differently.

559
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:10,260
The day I left and you said you wouldn't make
it, I didn't hear you because I was angry.

560
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,020
This is my chance to undo that mistake.

561
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,660
And I need you to help me.

562
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,100
But am I really Rheya?

563
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,220
I don't know any more.

564
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:31,820
All I see is you.

565
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:05,860
All I see is you.

566
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,940
It created me.

567
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:17,660
And yet I can't communicate with it.

568
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,620
It must hear me, though.

569
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:26,140
It must know what's happening to me.

570
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:30,420
And you and I, we would
have to have some kind of...

571
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,700
an arrangement, some kind of...

572
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,620
unspoken understanding...

573
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,900
that I'm not really a human being.

574
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:51,180
No, Rheya.

575
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,980
Chris...

576
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:01,220
Chris, I wish you would just
let them use the device on me.

577
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:08,820
And then you can go back to Earth
and you can tell everybody all about Solaris.

578
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,740
No.

579
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:17,860
It's the only solution that makes any sense.

580
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:22,100
We could never have
a life together on Earth, Chris.

581
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,780
You know that.

582
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,980
It would be impossible.

583
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:33,380
And this? What kind of life is this?

584
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,380
Trapped here.

585
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,820
It's not a life.

586
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,540
I don't know what to call it.

587
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,060
It's what we have.

588
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,300
It's enough for me.

589
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,100
You need to rest.

590
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,180
You're going to make yourself ill.

591
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:59,780
- I don't care.
- Just lie down for a moment.

592
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:01,700
Please, Chris.

593
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,580
You have to rest.

594
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:37,380
You know I'm not human
so I don't understand what you're afraid of.

595
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,860
Of course you can use the device.

596
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:43,380
It's not murder. You said that yourself.

597
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,060
You're the one who had
the idea in the first place.

598
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,380
Chris doesn't trust me. He...

599
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:37,220
<i>Chris, don't blame Gordon.</i>

600
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:42,380
<i>It's not her fault. I begged her to do it.</i>

601
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,180
<i>It's better this way.</i>

602
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,300
<i>I found the suicide note.</i>

603
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:52,500
<i>I went through your things.</i>

604
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:56,820
<i>The page torn from the book of poems.</i>

605
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:00,860
<i>And I realised...</i>

606
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,660
<i>I'm not her.</i>

607
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,340
<i>I'm not Rheya.</i>

608
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:09,380
<i>I know you loved me, though.</i>

609
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,820
<i>I know that. I felt that.</i>

610
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,460
<i>And I love you.</i>

611
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:20,820
<i>I wish we could just
live inside that feeling forever.</i>

612
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,380
<i>Maybe there's a place where we can.</i>

613
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,740
<i>But I know it's not on Earth.</i>

614
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:31,860
<i>And it's not on this ship.</i>

615
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:37,060
<i>That's all I can say right now.</i>

616
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,300
- You killed her!
- Not her. It.

617
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:03,220
- It's murder!
- Kelvin, she begged me. It wasn't painful.

618
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,700
- She'll be back!
- No.

619
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,540
- Why would you let her do it?!
- Kelvin!

620
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,540
It's not human!

621
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:14,020
Whatever it is, it's not human,
and I'm threatened by that.

622
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,900
And I wanna win. I want humans to win.

623
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:20,940
Whose side are you on?

624
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:27,500
- What are you doing?
- Putting the Al back online. I'm going home.

625
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:43,820
Gordon.

626
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:48,300
Gordon!

627
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,180
- I knew it.
- How long you think he's been dead?

628
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:18,860
Hard to say because of the cold.

629
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,660
He attacked me.

630
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:27,300
There I am. Somehow, there I am.

631
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:33,060
And I couldn't tell you how I'm there,
or who I am or what's going on.

632
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,660
But before I can get to that,

633
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,060
what's this over here?

634
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,740
Comin' at me. What...
what are you tryin' to do?

635
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,940
Oh, I see. You're tryin' to kill me.

636
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:50,020
Yeah, confusing. I'll tell you somethin'
confusing. Bingo, there you are,

637
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:53,740
and my welcoming committee
dropped his knife and it's good night.

638
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:58,100
And, oh, by the way, after all that I find, uh...

639
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:02,900
this, uh, whoever this... I get my first
good look at it and it happens to be...

640
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:06,020
I survive the first 30 seconds of this...

641
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:10,020
life, whatever you wanna call it...
by killing someone.

642
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:15,500
And, oh, ah, by killing someone
who happens to be me.

643
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:20,420
See, most people... I would think most people
in this position would be, like "This... ah."

644
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:25,180
"I don't know." However, this is at least...
This is an incredible opportunity.

645
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:28,900
This is... What if this is a gift? I'm a gift.

646
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:32,620
Hey.

647
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:38,900
I say we use the Higgs device on him.

648
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,500
Mm. Mm-mm.

649
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:49,340
I don't think you really have time.

650
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:53,380
Why would you say that?

651
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,740
Well, you know, ever since
we used the famous Higgs device,

652
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:01,860
Solaris started taking on mass exponentially.

653
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:06,100
You might have noticed
how we're a lot closer to it.

654
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:10,340
That would be because everything
within its gravitational field -

655
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:14,420
it's pulling it in.

656
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,060
Ah, and, yeah, sorry. By the way,

657
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:23,380
the Higgs device also
drained the fuel cell reactors.

658
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:30,700
Uh, if... Can I make a suggestion?

659
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:35,700
I mean, this is... You can do what you want,
but I would just lock me in here really tight

660
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:40,020
and take the "Athena" back.

661
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:46,260
Wear your seat belt.

662
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,380
Switch to internal power.

663
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:46,900
Start fuel cell operational diagnostic.

664
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:50,020
Service check on LGA.

665
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,220
Point and calibrate high-beam antenna.

666
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,980
Depressurising. Spin all turbines to standby.

667
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:00,500
Disengage coupling interlocks
and all docking couplers.

668
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:05,500
Vent and seal
all main engine propellant lines.

669
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,740
<i>Earth.</i>

670
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:27,660
<i>Even the word sounded strange to me now.</i>

671
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,380
<i>Unfamiliar.</i>

672
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:36,580
<i>How long had I been gone?</i>

673
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:39,860
<i>How long had I been back?</i>

674
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,740
<i>Did it matter?</i>

675
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:52,100
<i>I tried to find the rhythm
of the world where I used to live.</i>

676
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,180
<i>I followed the current.</i>

677
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,140
<i>I was silent and attentive.</i>

678
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:02,900
<i>I made a conscious effort to smile...</i>

679
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,060
<i>nod...</i>

680
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,620
<i>stand...</i>

681
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:14,100
<i>and perform the millions of gestures
that constitute life on Earth.</i>

682
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:21,300
<i>I studied these gestures
until they became reflexes again.</i>

683
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,380
<i>But I was haunted by the idea</i>

684
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,540
<i>that I remembered her wrong.</i>

685
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:36,180
<i>That somehow I was wrong about everything.</i>

686
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:41,700
Depressurising.
Spin all turbines to standby.

687
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:45,740
Disengage coupling interlocks
and all docking couplers.

688
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:50,780
Vent and seal
all main engine propellant lines.

689
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,780
Rheya!

690
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,580
Rheya?

691
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:15,500
Chris?

692
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:19,100
Chris?

693
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:01,300
Am I alive... or dead?

694
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:07,860
We don't have to think like that any more.

695
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:14,100
We're together now.

696
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:19,220
Everything we've done is forgiven.

697
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,700
Everything.
