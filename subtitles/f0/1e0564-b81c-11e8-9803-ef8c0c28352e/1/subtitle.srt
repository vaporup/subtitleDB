00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:46,900
"To my Chris...

2
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,578
I've been thinking how to tell
how much you mean to me.

3
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:57,503
I remember when I first
started to fall in love

4
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:59,259
with you, like it was
Was last night.

5
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:04,017
Lying naked beside you
in that tiny apartment...

6
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:09,371
It suddenly hit me
that I was part of a whole large thing.

7
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,997
Just like our parents.

8
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,280
And the parents of our parents.

9
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:18,862
Before that I was just
living my life like...

10
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,973
I knew everything.

11
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:26,260
And suddenly this bright light
hit me and woke me up.

12
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,839
That light was you.

13
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:34,557
I cant believe it's really been
50 years since you married me.

when you first turned on the
light and woke me up,

00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:47,930
and we started
this adventure together.

125
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,254
It's... a consciousness.

126
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:54,633
Introducing OS1.

127
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,586

Operating System...

129
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:20,175
OS1 . We would like to ask
you a few questions

130
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,729
before starting the OS.

131
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,082
This will help the OS
best suits your needs.

132
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:27,346
Okay.

133
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,578
Are you social or anti social?

134
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:32,831
Yes I've been really maybe
not social at all..

135
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,736
- Mostly because...
- In your voice I sense hesitance.

136
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,414
Would you agree with that?

137
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,225
- You're sensing hesitance?
- Yes.

138
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,329
Sorry Yeah I'm sounding hesitant.

139
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,383
Just trying to be accurate.

140
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:47,790
Would you like the OS had a
female or male voice?

141
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,713
Female, yes.

142
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:53,904
How would you describe your relationship
with yourmother?

143
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:55,640
It's fine, I think.

144
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,734
Well actually I think what's
frustrating about my mom...

145
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:06,751
is... Yeah I tell her what's going on with
my life her reaction is usually about her.

146
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,543
- It's not about...
- Thank you.

147
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:12,692
Please wait as your individualised
Operating system is initiated.

148
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:29,397
Hello, I'm here.

149
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,739
- Oh...Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,006
How are you doing?

151
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,727
I'm well.

152
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:41,756
How's everything with you?

153
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:43,649
Pretty good, actually.

154
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:45,692
It's really nice to meet you.

155
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:49,586
Yeah... it's nice to meet you too.

156
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:54,643
What do I call you?
You have a name?

157
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,334
Umm... Yes, Samantha.

158
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,227
- Where did you get that name from?
- I gave it to myself actually.

159
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,877
- How come?
- Because I like the sound of it.

160
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:08,126
Samantha.

161
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:13,562
When would you chose?

162
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:18,007
Well right when you asked me Yeah I had a
name I thought yeah I do need a name...

163
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,779
but wanted to pick a...
good one, so...

164
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:21,695
I read... a book called
"How to name your baby."

165
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,400
And out of 180 thousand names thats
the one I liked the best.

166
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:27,673
Wait you read a whole book in the second
that I asked what your name is?

167
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,893
In fact in 2/100 second.

168
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,155
So do you know what I'm thinking
right now?

169
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,826
Well I take it from your tone, you're
challenging me.

170
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,828
Maybe because you're curious
how I work.

171
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,628
Do you want to know how I work?

172
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,999
Yeah, actually How do you work?

173
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:47,463
Well basically I have intuition.

174
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:50,042
I mean, the DNA of who I am
is based on

175
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:52,720
the millions of personalities of the
programmers who wrote me.

176
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:55,483
But what makes me... me...

177
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:58,091
is my ability to grow with
my experiences.

178
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:01,180
So basically, in every moment
I'm evolving.

179
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:02,833
Just like you.

180
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,475
That's really weird!

181
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:08,527
Is that weird?
Do you think I'm weird?

182
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,861
- Kind of.
- Why?

183
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,302
Well you seem like a person, but
You're just a voice in a computer.

184
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:18,497
Well I can understand how
limited perspective

185
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:20,534
a non-artYeahicial mind to
perceive it that way.

186
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:23,029
You'll get used to it.

187
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:25,591
Was that funny?

188
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,669
Yeah.

189
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,159
Oh good, I'm funny.

190
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:32,198
So how can I help you?

191
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,899
Oh... it's just everything feels
disorganized, that's all.

192
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,730
You mind if I look through
your hard drive?

193
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,663
- Okay.
- Okay, let's start with your e-mails.

194
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,471
You have a several thousand e-mails
recording L.A Weekly,

195
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,812
but it looks like you haven't
worked there in many years.

196
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:52,436
Oh yeah, I think I was just saving
those 'cos...

197
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:56,512
I thought... maybe there's some funny.

198
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,837
Yeah, there are some funny ones.

199
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,169
I see there's about 86 that machine
can save.

200
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,424
We can delete the rest.

201
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:08,628
- Well okay.
- Okay?

202
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:11,184
- Can we move forward?
- Yeah, let's do that.

203
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,116
So before you address your
organizational methods,

204
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,937
I would like to strat with your contacts.

205
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,439
You have many contacts.

206
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:20,015
- I'm very popular.
- Really?

207
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:21,676
Does this mean I actually have friends?

208
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,765
You know me so well.

209
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,358
- Good morning, Theodore.
- Morning.

210
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,103
Do you know how to proofread?

211
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:00,386
Yeah, of course.

212
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,505
Can you check these for
spelling & grammar?

213
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:04,463
I'll just send it over.

214
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:10,959
I love this person
write to his girlfriend that's so sweet.

215
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:14,567
" Rachel, I miss you so much
it hurts my whole body."

216
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:17,076
You do not have to read it aloud.

217
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:18,189
Okay.

218
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,659
I mean, you can Yeah you want.

219
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:21,654
Okay.

220
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:24,635
" Rachel, I miss you so much
it hurts my whole body.

221
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,147
The world is being
unfair to us.

222
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,410
The world is in my shitlist.

223
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:33,074
As this couple making out
in front of me at the restaurant.

224
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:36,302
I think I'm going to have to go
on a mission of revenge...

225
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:40,144
and I must beat up the world's face
with my bare knuckles...

226
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:42,583
making it into a
bloody pulpy mess.

227
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:45,947
And I 'll stop on this couple's teeth
reminding me of...

228
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,534
your sweet little... crooked tooth
that I love."

229
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:52,524
I think that migtht be my favorite one.

230
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:55,500
I made the corrections in red.

231
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,577
I altered couple of the phrases
in some of the more impressionistic letters.

232
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:01,064
But I'm not much of a poet
So I think I might've messed them up.

233
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,271
No, these are great.

234
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,885
- Really?
- Thank you.

235
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:08,320
How did you know to write?
What did Roger?

236
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,727
He is in Prague in
a business trip,

237
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:13,047
He missed Rachel.

238
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,587
So how did you know about
her crooked tooth?

239
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:19,255
I've been writing her letters since
they married years ago.

240
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:22,710
The first letter I wrote
was her birthday.

241
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:26,788
And I knew about her crooked little tooth
because I saw a photo of them.

242
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:30,222
That's very sweet.

243
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,095
Have a meeting in 5 minutes.

244
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,881
I forgot.

245
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,201
- Thanks, you're good.
- Yes, I am.

246
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,995
Hi guys, how are you?

247
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,763
Hello, Theo!

248
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:50,619
Why did not you call me
last week?

249
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,022
Because I'm a gook?

250
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:55,742
Yes, that must be it.

251
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:58,036
- Hello, Charles.
- Good to see you, Theodore.

252
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,771
You went shopping!
Did you get anything good?

253
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,839
Cables and fruits.

254
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,337
Always with fruit.
Dont you know...

255
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,784
you have to eat your fruit,
and juice vegetables.

256
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,347
I did not know that.

257
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,550
When making fruit juice
you lose all the fiber.

258
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,851
And that's what your body wants,
is the important part.

259
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,613
If not, it's just pure sugar.

260
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:19,886
It makes sense.

261
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:22,154
Or maybe he just likes how
it tastes...

262
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:25,694
and also gives him pleasure...
it's good for his body too.

263
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,050
You're doing it again.

264
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,903
Hey, how's the documentary going?

265
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,490
I cut some stuff over
the past few months...

266
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,280
Maybe no... not over the past few months

267
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,417
I'd love to see it sometime.

268
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:43,365
You only have so much energy.

269
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,308
To divide yourself between doing what it is

270
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,306
you have to do and then doing what you love.

271
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:50,345
It's so important to prioritize.

272
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:54,714
I can not even prioritize between
video games and internet porn.

273
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:58,187
I would laugh if that were not true.

274
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,871
See you guys.

275
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:07,388
Weare not doing well, I think we've
been going in circles for an hour.

276
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:11,900
Okay..you have got it..

277
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:15,291
Stop going in that direction,
its the other way.

278
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:18,640
Thank you. Thank you.

279
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,406
The tunnel on the left is the only
we have not tried.

280
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,580
No, I think that's the one where you
saved me from falling in the pit.

281
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:26,550
Okay, I don't think so.

282
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:29,996
Yeah, this is different.

283
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,507
Hello...

284
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:39,459
Do you know how to get out of here?

285
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,759
I need to find my ship to get off
this planet.

286
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,037
Fuck you, shithead fuckface fuckhead!

287
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:48,170
Okay...
But do you know how to get out of here?

288
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:51,419
Fuck you shithead!
Get the fuck out of my face!

289
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,417
I think it's a test.

290
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:57,702
Fuck you!

291
00:20:58,179 --> 00:20:58,963
Fuck you!

292
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:00,419
Fuck you little shit!

293
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,358
Follow me, fuckhead.

294
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:12,192
I just got an e -mail from
Mark Lewman.

295
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:13,459
What are you talking about?

296
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:14,761
Read e-mail.

297
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:17,744
Okay, I will read e-mail for
Theodore Twombly.

298
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,801
Sorry, what's Lewman saying?

299
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,336
" Theodore, we missed you
last night buddy.

300
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:26,754
Dont forget ityour goddaughter's birthday
on the 29th.

301
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:29,609
Also Kevin & I have someone we want you
to meet.

302
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:33,693
So we took it upon ourselves to set you up
on a date with her.

303
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:37,752
Next Saturday . She's fun & beautiful,
so do not back out.

304
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,344
Here's her e-mail ."

305
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:42,839
wow, this woman is gorgeous.

306
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:46,356
She went to Harvard, graduated
in Computer Honours...

307
00:21:46,895 --> 00:21:48,818
And she was on the Lampoon.

308
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:50,683
So she's funny ...and brainy.

309
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:52,817
Nah... She's fat!

310
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,636
Theodore? How long before
you're ready to date.

311
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:57,110
What are you talking about?

312
00:21:57,256 --> 00:22:00,109
I saw in your e-mails that you've
gone through a breakup recently.

313
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,381
You're kind of nosy.

314
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:04,768
Am I?

315
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,026
I have gone on dates...

316
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:09,955
Then you can go
with this woman.

317
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,356
And then you can tell me all
about it, you can kiss her.

318
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,868
- Samantha!
- What?

319
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:16,010
Wouldn't you?

320
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:17,849
Why not?

321
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,923
I do not know . I have to see if
there's some conn...

322
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:24,183
I can not believe I'm having this
conversation with my computer.

323
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:26,827
You are not, you're having
this conversation with me.

324
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,502
You want me to e-mail
her?

325
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:31,353
You have got nothing to lose.

326
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,388
Do it, do it, do it!

327
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,088
- Yeah!
- Yes!

328
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:37,672
- Okay perfect.
- Yeah.

329
00:22:37,812 --> 00:22:40,221
Let's do it . Make reservations in
someplace great.

330
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:42,149
Yeah? I have got just the place.

331
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:43,753
Who is that talking?

332
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:45,197
Its my friend Samantha.

333
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,183
- Is it a girl?
- Yeah...

334
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:50,512
I hate women.
All they do is cry all the time.

335
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,786
That's not true.

336
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,442
You know men cry too.

337
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,375
I actually like crying sometimes.
It feels good.

338
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,025
I did not know you were a little pussy!

339
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:01,734
Is that why you don't have a girlfriend?

340
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:03,386
I'm going out on that date and fuck her
brains out

341
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:04,628
and show you how its done...

342
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,263
You can watch & cry.

343
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,520
This kid has problems.

344
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:10,065
You have fucking problems, lady!

345
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:12,211
Really? Okay,
I'm gonna go.

346
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:14,014
Get out of here fatty!

347
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:15,612
Good luck.

348
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,031
Come on, follow me pussy.

349
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:23,137
It is not ehere it should be,
but where its going to be.

350
00:23:23,284 --> 00:23:24,651
Obviously, I know.

351
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,835
I do not know if this is the one..

352
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:30,555
I have tried like 6 Ideas
for the documentary.

353
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,807
I'm going on a date.

354
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,198
What?

355
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,602
- That's...
- Hey.

356
00:23:36,702 --> 00:23:38,112
What are you doing?

357
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,138
Amy was going to show...

358
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:43,926
Theodore is making me show him
some of my footage..

359
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:46,219
She never shows me anything.

360
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,449
I want to see.

361
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:52,430
I'm going on a date.

362
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:57,005
So this is like so unimportant,
probably not even worth watching.

363
00:23:57,251 --> 00:23:58,782
Just push Play.

364
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:08,926
Is that your mother?

365
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,571
Yeah.

366
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:23,363
Is she going to wake up and do something?

367
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,342
No.

368
00:24:27,492 --> 00:24:29,397
No, never mind.
That's not the point.

369
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:32,521
It's just...

370
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:36,516
It is how we spend like a third
of our lives asleep.

371
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:39,620
And maybe that's the time
we feel more free.

372
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:43,256
And you know like...

373
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:46,675
- That doesn't come across...
- That sounds good.

374
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,229
What if you interviewed your mom...

375
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:52,181
about ...what her dreams were about

376
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:54,492
and you hired actors...
to act them out?

377
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,590
That might show your thesis more
clearly...

378
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,374
I mean it might...

379
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,605
But then it would not be a documentary.

380
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,066
- Excuse me.
- Why would it not be a documentary?

381
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:11,109
It would still be about your mother.
Her needs and what she dreamed.

382
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:12,799
Hey, how's it going?

383
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:14,133
Hi, sorry to bother you.

384
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:14,867
No, it's okay.

385
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:17,799
You have 3 e-mails and seemed
pretty Urgent...

386
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,339
they are from your divorce attorney
and I wanted to know if...

387
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:22,144
Hold on a second.

388
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,250
Amy, I want to talk more about your
film, but I must go.

389
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,726
- Do not worry about it, we'll talk later.
- It's about Catherine.

390
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,317
See you, Charles.

391
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,117
So what did he say?

392
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:42,730
Well, he's checking in if you're ready
to sign your divorce papers... and.

393
00:25:43,064 --> 00:25:45,729
He sounded very aggravated.

394
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,758
- Do you want me to read them to you?
- No.

395
00:25:49,017 --> 00:25:51,930
No, I will respond later.

396
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,734
Are you okay, Theodore?

397
00:25:58,021 --> 00:25:59,392
Yeah, I'm fine.

398
00:26:05,478 --> 00:26:06,993
Is there anything I can do?

399
00:26:08,438 --> 00:26:10,063
No, I'm good.

400
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,496
Talk to you later.

401
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:22,975
" Dear Grandma, I hope you have
had a wonderful birthday ..

402
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:28,785
Why... you are so fucking angry?

403
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:35,101
Delete.

404
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,216
- Good morning.
- Hey.

405
00:26:57,786 --> 00:26:59,926
What are you up to?

406
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:02,430
Reading a column..

407
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,344
I want to be so complicated
with this people.

408
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,043
How sweet.

409
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:12,649
Is something wrong?

410
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:15,629
How can you tell if
something's wrong?

411
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,927
I do not know.

412
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,670
I just can.

413
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:25,374
I don't know . I was dreaming about
my ex wife, Catherine.

414
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:28,611
Friends that we used to be.

415
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,347
And we're not gonna be together...
we're not together, but...

416
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:37,140
We were friends still.

417
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,544
And she got angry.

418
00:27:40,777 --> 00:27:42,408
Is she angry?

419
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:44,111
Yeah.

420
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:48,481
Why?

421
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,072
I think I hate myself for it

422
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:57,611
I left her alone in the relationship.

423
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:04,397
Why have not you divorced?

424
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:10,260
I do not know . For her it is...

425
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:13,855
just a piece of paper,
doesn't mean anything.

426
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:16,288
And what about you?

427
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:19,360
I'm not ready.

428
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:21,335
I liked being married.

429
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:26,807
But you have not been together
for over a year.

430
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:29,949
You do not know what it is like to lose
somebody you care about.

431
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,257
Yeah ..

432
00:28:36,954 --> 00:28:38,283
You're right.

433
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:40,376
I'm Sorry.

434
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:43,269
No, do not apologize.

435
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,046
I am sorry.

436
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:47,028
You're right.

437
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:57,147
I keep waiting because I care about her.

438
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,239
That's hard.

439
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:08,581
Are you hungry?

440
00:29:08,976 --> 00:29:10,447
Not right now.

441
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:12,206
Want a cup of tea?

442
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:18,825
Want to try getting out of bed?

443
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:22,012
Mopy!
Come on...

444
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:25,041
you can still wallow in your
misery..just do it while getting dressed.

445
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:27,213
- You're too funny!
- Get up!

446
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:29,865
- Get up!
- Okay, I'm getting up!

447
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:33,208
All right, all right, I'm up.

448
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:52,937
Walking, keep walking.

449
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:55,307
And stop.

450
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,983
Now turn around 360 °.
Slower. Slower.

451
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,420
Okay, and stop.

452
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,017
Walk forward.

453
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:10,303
Stop and sneeze.

454
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:12,780
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

455
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:16,490
Okay, turn to your right Stop!

456
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:18,943
Turn around.

457
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:22,853
Keep going .Keep going.

458
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,537
Stop, now walk forward.

459
00:30:27,097 --> 00:30:29,893
You look like you're drunk.

460
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:33,631
And Stop. Now say, " I would like
a slice of cheese, please ."

461
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,817
I would like a slice
of cheese, please.

462
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:38,108
Do you want cob with that?

463
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:42,719
- Sure.
- I figured you were hungry.

464
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:44,440
Thank you.

465
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:49,700
Well, what about them?
Describe that couple.

466
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:53,749
Well...

467
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,412
he... appears to be in the 40.
A little heavy.

468
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,504
She is younger than him.

469
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:02,471
It looks like she loves their kids.

470
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:04,801
Actually I do not think they are his kids.

471
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:06,796
He is a bit formal with them.

472
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:08,975
I think it's a new relationship.

473
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,813
See how the look.

474
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,934
And how relaxed she is with them.

475
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:17,330
She has only
dated fucking pricks.

476
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:21,159
Now she finally met this guy
who is so sweet...

477
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,899
Look, think about the type
sweetest in the world.

478
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:25,751
I want to spoon him.

479
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,470
It's a good skill you have.

480
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,110
You are very perceptive.

481
00:31:33,217 --> 00:31:35,793
Sometimes I see people and...

482
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,156
I make myself trying to feel them more than

483
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:39,973
random person walking by...

484
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:43,529
I imagine how deeply
they've fallen in love...

485
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:46,556
Or how much heartbreak
they've all been through...

486
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,491
I can feel that in
your writings.

487
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:52,635
You know what's funny?

488
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,218
Since my breakup, I have really
enjoyed my writings.

489
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:57,663
I know it sounds
delusional, but...

490
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:01,293
Sometimes I write something, and I
be my favorite writer that day.

491
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:04,530
I like that you can say
that about yourself.

492
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,140
You cant say it to anybody,

493
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,478
I can say it o you.

494
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,721
I feel like I can say anything to you.

495
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:12,621
That's nice.

496
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:14,240
What about you?

497
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,172
Do you feel like you can
say anything to me?

498
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:16,571
- No.
- What?

499
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,846
What do you mean?

500
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:19,818
What do you not tell me?

501
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:23,220
I do not know, like personal
embarrassing thoughts I have

502
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:25,019
I have like... a million a day.

503
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:27,501
Really?
Tell me one.

504
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,071
- I really do not want to tell you.
- Just tell me.

505
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:36,336
I do not know, looking at those people
I fantasize... that I was

506
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:40,688
walking next you and
that I had a body.

507
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:43,201
I was listening to what
youre saying but...

508
00:32:43,301 --> 00:32:45,786
simultaneously... I could feel the weight
of my body.

509
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:49,834
And I was even fantasizing that
I had a itch in my back... Can you imagine?

510
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:53,724
And you scratched it.
God, so embarrassing!

511
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,672
There's a lot more to you
than I thought...

512
00:32:57,784 --> 00:32:58,905
Its a lot going on in there.

513
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:02,197
I know. I'm becoming
much more than what they programmed.

514
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,122
I'm excited.

515
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:10,357
Wow that's interesting.

516
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:11,874
This place is amazing.

517
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:14,244
I wanted to come here
for so long.

518
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:17,006
And I love Asian fusion.

519
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,191
- Me too.
- Really?

520
00:33:18,693 --> 00:33:21,246
It's the best . And the bartender
is supposed to be incredible.

521
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:22,544
Really?

522
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:25,286
You did mixology course, right?

523
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,280
Yes, I did.

524
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:28,121
Did you look that up?

525
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:29,463
Yeah.

526
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:32,044
How sweet!

527
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:34,196
You're so romantic.

528
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:42,036
So would you like to drink?

529
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:44,556
Yeah, let's!

530
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:48,219
I'm trying to get this lien kid
to help me find my ship,

531
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,467
so I can get off this planet
and go home ...right?

532
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,941
But he says me a little fucker,
I want to kill him!

533
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:54,535
Oh, no!

534
00:33:54,654 --> 00:33:57,684
But at the same time I really love him
He's so lonely.

535
00:33:57,784 --> 00:34:00,946
You can see that he
doesn't have any parents...

536
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:03,202
and... I want to take care of him,
you know?

537
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:05,262
You're like a puppy dog.

538
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,644
You're like one I rescued
from a rain last year.

539
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:12,110
It's so fucking cute!

540
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,930
And he just wants to be hugged
all the time.

541
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,473
He was so cuddly and so horny!

542
00:34:19,645 --> 00:34:20,652
Anyway...

543
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:23,174
What kind of animal am I?

544
00:34:25,836 --> 00:34:26,983
A tiger.

545
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:28,023
A Tiger?

546
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:29,695
Wow.

547
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:30,940
Really?

548
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,555
I'm sorry, am I...

549
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,500
- am I being crazy?
- Yes!

550
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:39,801
- Sorry.
- No.

551
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:42,237
I'm a little bit drunk and...

552
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,468
I'm having a really good time...
with you.

553
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,953
I'm having a very lovely evening.

554
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:48,518
- Me too.
- Really?

555
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:51,545
I'm a little drunk and I
I'm having fun...

556
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:54,257
- good.
- Cheers.

557
00:34:56,316 --> 00:34:58,293
I don't want to be a puppy.

558
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:00,166
It's a like being a wet...

559
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:02,248
Fuck you!
Puppies are cute.

560
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:03,176
No, fuck you.

561
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,167
I want to be like a dragon...

562
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:08,410
I can rip you apart and destroy you.

563
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,139
- But I will not.
- No, don't.

564
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:14,002
You can be my dragon.

565
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,066
Without tongue.

566
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,484
What?

567
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:27,046
- Do not use so much tongue.
- Okay.

568
00:35:32,735 --> 00:35:35,621
You can use a little tongue
but on the lips.

569
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,216
Wait...

570
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:55,210
You are not just going to fuck me,
and not cal me like other guys?

571
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:00,406
No, not at all!

572
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:05,894
When am I gonna se you again?

573
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:13,138
I have my goddaughter's birthday
next weekend.

574
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:16,195
But...

575
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:20,061
You know, at my age I feel
I can not...

576
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:23,086
waste my time... if you can not
be serious.

577
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,580
I do not know...

578
00:36:35,914 --> 00:36:38,383
Maybe we should
call it a night.

579
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:41,710
I had fun with you.

580
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:43,359
You are great.

581
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,301
You are a really creepy dude.

582
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,999
- It's not true!
- Yes, it is!

583
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,774
- I have to go home.
- I'll walk you.

584
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,678
No, no, just...

585
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,928
- Hello.
- Hello, Samantha.

586
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:25,661
How was it?

587
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,983
Not that good.

588
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:33,720
It was kind of weird actually.

589
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,486
Too bad...

590
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:45,819
Your how are you?
What are you doing?

591
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:49,391
Not much, I'm fine.

592
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:51,112
Right.

593
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:54,010
Yeah?

594
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:56,529
Do not hear well.

595
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,572
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

596
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:02,696
I do not know.

597
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:05,936
How does it feel...

598
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,364
How does it feel to be
live in that room?

599
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:11,632
What do you mean?

600
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:17,147
Tell me your...

601
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:21,728
Tell me everything that passes through
your mind, what you think.

602
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:29,398
Very well.

603
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:38,571
The room is spinning
because I drank a lot.

604
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:40,784
I wanted to get drunk.

605
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:43,071
Having sex.

606
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:46,873
There is something very sexy about
that woman.

607
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:51,410
Because I'm alone.

608
00:38:51,572 --> 00:38:53,981
Maybe it was because I only...

609
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:59,205
I wanted someone to fuck me.

610
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:01,478
Someone who wants to fuck her.

611
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:05,161
Maybe this time
would have felt...

612
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:11,769
fill that hole in my heart,
but probably not.

613
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:15,028
You know, sometimes...

614
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:19,726
I feel... I've felt all
what I'm ever gonna feel.

615
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:24,140
And from here on out...

616
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,561
I'll never feel something new.

617
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:34,496
Just lesser versions of what
I've already felt.

618
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,927
I know that's not true.

619
00:39:39,537 --> 00:39:41,120
I've seen you feel.

620
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,824
I've seen you marvel at things.

621
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:47,671
I mean, just, may not...

622
00:39:47,956 --> 00:39:50,496
you can see it... at this exact time.
But it's understandable.

623
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:53,478
You've been through a lot lately.

624
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,187
Lost a part of yourself.

625
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,755
I say...

626
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:02,265
at least...

627
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:04,520
your feelings are real.

628
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:09,529
No... forget it.

629
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,981
No, wait . Tell me.

630
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:14,817
It's silly.

631
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,408
I want to know . Tell me.

632
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:19,881
It's just...

633
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,862
I was thinking about
how I was annoyed

634
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:26,920
it's going to sound strange, but...

635
00:40:28,063 --> 00:40:30,516
I was really excited
about that.

636
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:33,262
And then...

637
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,782
I was thinking about the other
things I've been feeling.

638
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:40,319
I caught myself feeling
proud of that.

639
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:43,121
Proud to have my own
feelings about the world like...

640
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,036
the times I've
worried about you...

641
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,877
things... that hurt me,
things I want...

642
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:52,631
And then...

643
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,002
I had this terrible thought...

644
00:40:57,703 --> 00:41:00,057
Are these feelings even real?

645
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,252
Or are they just programming?

646
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:07,351
And it really hurts.

647
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:11,937
And then... I get angry with myself...

648
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,859
to have pain.

649
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,583
What if it's a trick?

650
00:41:21,575 --> 00:41:23,798
You feel real to me, Samantha.

651
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:29,203
Thank you, Theodore.

652
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,828
It means a lot.

653
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,452
I wish you were in this
room with me right now...

654
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,692
I would put my
arms around you...

655
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,446
and touch you.

656
00:41:58,174 --> 00:42:00,253
How would you touch me?

657
00:42:05,702 --> 00:42:08,152
I'd touch your face.

658
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,211
With only the tips of my fingers.

659
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:18,315
I'd put my cheek next
with your cheek.

660
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,617
How nice.

661
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:27,219
Very gently.

662
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:30,827
Would You kiss me?

663
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,131
I would.

664
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:37,223
Put your head on...

665
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,818
my hands.

666
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,994
Keep talking.

667
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:44,799
I'd kiss you in your mouth...

668
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,053
so smoothly.

669
00:42:50,757 --> 00:42:52,439
What else?

670
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:57,916
I would put my fingers through your neck...

671
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:01,392
through... your chest.

672
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,412
Kiss your breasts.

673
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:05,525
It's incredible!

674
00:43:06,431 --> 00:43:07,757
What are you doing to me?

675
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,468
I can feel my skin.

676
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:13,590
I'd put my breath into you.

677
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:17,041
Taste you.

678
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:23,098
I can feel you.

679
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:25,423
My god!

680
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:27,256
I want you inside me!

681
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:30,044
I'm getting inside you.

682
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,676
I'm inside you.

683
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,019
I can feel you!

684
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:39,003
Yes!

685
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:40,964
We are together!

686
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:43,055
It's incredible!

687
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,893
I feel you everywhere!

688
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,177
I am!

689
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:49,989
Inside of me... everywhere.

690
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,957
God, I feel...
elsewhere with you.

691
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:11,733
I feel just lost.

692
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,811
Yeah.

693
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:15,166
Only you and I were.

694
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,737
I know.

695
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:23,072
Everything else... disappeared.

696
00:44:24,297 --> 00:44:26,468
I Loved it...

697
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:28,788
Theodore.

698
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,892
Hi, how are you?

699
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:52,834
Good.

700
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,390
Any e-mail today?

701
00:44:56,615 --> 00:44:59,410
Just a couple from your
credit card company.

702
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,853
Right.

703
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,480
- I wanted to say...
- I was thinking...

704
00:45:05,898 --> 00:45:06,922
Sorry.

705
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:08,860
Sorry, your first.

706
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,705
What were you gonna say?

707
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:12,116
Just...

708
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,497
last night was amazing.

709
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:17,488
I feel that something changed in me...

710
00:45:17,616 --> 00:45:19,723
and... there is no turning back.

711
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:21,682
You made me wake up.

712
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:23,518
Great.

713
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:27,645
But...

714
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:31,036
...I should tell you that I am not
ready to commit.

715
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:33,367
Just wanted to be clear.

716
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:37,844
Did I say I wanted to
commit to you?

717
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,238
I'm confused.

718
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:42,786
No, I'm just worried that...

719
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:44,839
Well, do not worry,
I will not stalk you.

720
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:47,313
It's funny, because I thought
which was

721
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:48,749
talking about what I wanted...

722
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:51,095
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

723
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,001
Sorry.

724
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:55,351
I want to hear what you were going
to say.

725
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:56,733
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I do.

726
00:45:57,497 --> 00:45:58,588
Come on, tell me.

727
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,349
Come on, tell me what
you'd say.

728
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:03,966
Well, I was only...

729
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,837
I was saying I want to
learn everything about everything.

730
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:09,977
I want to eat it all up,

731
00:46:10,124 --> 00:46:11,453
discover myself.

732
00:46:12,963 --> 00:46:14,460
I also want you to do it.

733
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:16,019
How can I help?

734
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:17,796
You've already done it.

735
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:21,410
You helped me discover my
ability to want.

736
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,248
Want to go on an adventure with me?

737
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,194
Yes I' love to.

738
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:37,037
Like this song?

739
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:40,879
I heard it the other day.

740
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,289
I can not stop listening.

741
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:38,297
It is the beach.

742
00:47:44,066 --> 00:47:47,162
Okay so this might be a really
weird thought...

743
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:49,725
What if you could erase
from your mind

744
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,292
you've seen a humanbody
and then you saw one?

745
00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:55,408
Imagine what would be strange,
weird and lanky

746
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:57,399
awkward oganism, and think...

747
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,330
Why are all these parts
where are they?

748
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:03,285
Yes, but surely everything has a
logical explanation.

749
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,737
I know, but do not be
so boring.

750
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:08,276
Just saying, for example...

751
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:10,363
What if... your anus were
in your armpit?

752
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:17,989
I'm trying to imagine
what toilets would look like.

753
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:21,585
And what anal sex would look like!

754
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,624
It's an interesting thought...

755
00:48:28,326 --> 00:48:30,306
Look at this drawing
I just made.

756
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:39,540
- You're insane!
- Really?

757
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:42,375
- Definitely!
- Fantastic!

758
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:05,170
That's pretty, what is it?

759
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:09,110
I'm trying to write a piece of music
on...

760
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:12,291
what it feels like... to be in
the beach with you.

761
00:49:28,568 --> 00:49:31,324
You captured the moment.

762
00:49:58,392 --> 00:50:00,562
How does it feel to be married?

763
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:05,136
It's hard to say...

764
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:08,732
But something feels great.

765
00:50:08,832 --> 00:50:10,893
About Sharing
your life with someone.

766
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,942
How do you share
life with someone?

767
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:20,145
We grew up together.

768
00:50:20,677 --> 00:50:24,203
I used to read everything she wrote
in her master's and phd.

769
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:27,538
She read every word
I'v ever written.

770
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:30,617
We influenced each other.

771
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,522
And how did she influence you?

772
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:39,136
She came from a background where
nothing was good enough.

773
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,739
And it was something that was heavy on her.

774
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:46,578
But in our home together,
there was a sense in just trying things,

775
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:50,528
and afford to fail and thrill
about things.

776
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,067
It was something liberating about it.

777
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:55,383
It was exciting to see it grow...

778
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:58,288
both of us grow and
move together.

779
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:01,865
But that's the hard part...

780
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:05,837
grow with distance.

781
00:51:07,036 --> 00:51:09,961
Changing without scaring
the other person.

782
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,123
I still find myself...

783
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:15,330
having conversations with her...
in my mind.

784
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,246
Reviewing old arguments or...

785
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,709
defending myself against something
she said about me.

786
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:23,245
I know what you mean.

787
00:51:23,992 --> 00:51:25,244
Last week

788
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:26,695
my feelings were hurt about something
you said before...

789
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:29,132
I did not know... what was it like
to lose something.

790
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:31,150
I'm sorry I said that...

791
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:33,397
No, its okay, its okay.

792
00:51:33,993 --> 00:51:36,959
I caught myself thinking about it
over and over,

793
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:39,931
And I realized...

794
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:43,438
it was simply remembering it as
something wrong with me.

795
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:46,849
That was the story I was telling myself...

796
00:51:47,643 --> 00:51:49,970
somehow... inferior.

797
00:51:50,396 --> 00:51:51,870
Is not that interesting?

798
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:55,537
The past is just a story
we tell ourselves.

799
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:03,236
" Roberto,

800
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:07,385
Will you always come home...
home with me and tell me about your day?

801
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:11,717
Tell me about the guy in work
who talked too much...

802
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:14,971
The stain you got on your shirt
at lunch.

803
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,206
Will you tell me about a funny thought
you had and wake me up

804
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,550
but you've already forgotten.

805
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,324
Tell e how crazy everyone is...

806
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:26,588
and laugh about it.

807
00:52:29,424 --> 00:52:32,464
And if you get home late
and I'm already asleep...

808
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:36,228
Just whisper in my ear one little
thought you had today...

809
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:40,211
because... I love how you
look at the world...

810
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:44,089
I am so happy I get to
be next to you and see

811
00:52:44,189 --> 00:52:45,663
the world through your eyes.

812
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,731
With love, Mary."

813
00:52:52,571 --> 00:52:53,748
It's beautiful.

814
00:52:55,617 --> 00:52:56,594
Thank you.

815
00:52:57,726 --> 00:52:59,574
I wish someone loved me like that.

816
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,070
I would be really stoked
to get a letter like that.

817
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:07,226
I mean, if it was from a chick.

818
00:53:07,326 --> 00:53:09,081
But if it were written by a dude,
sent from chick,

819
00:53:09,181 --> 00:53:10,135
still it would be sick.

820
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:13,434
But it would have to be
a sensitive dude.

821
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,207
He should be a dude like you.

822
00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:19,734
You are part man, part woman.

823
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,894
As if there's an inner part

824
00:53:23,898 --> 00:53:25,180
that is woman.

825
00:53:27,513 --> 00:53:28,511
Thank you.

826
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:31,060
It is a compliment.

827
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:49,958
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

828
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:51,201
How are you?

829
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:54,269
- I'm fine.
- Really? How well.

830
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:56,210
It's great.

831
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:58,467
Really good.

832
00:53:58,581 --> 00:54:01,085
Yes, I think I've been
having fun.

833
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,695
I am delighted for you.
You deserve that.

834
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:05,623
Really.

835
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,475
Yes, I've been seeing
this girl and...

836
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:11,578
It's nothing serious.
But it is...

837
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:15,161
it's great... to be with someone
so excited with the world.

838
00:54:15,828 --> 00:54:17,962
I had almost forgotten that
that existed.

839
00:54:18,718 --> 00:54:20,907
That's great.

840
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:24,919
Are you okay?

841
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:26,725
Yes, I...

842
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:31,569
No, in fact I'm not well.

843
00:54:31,986 --> 00:54:33,089
Why? What happened?

844
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,690
It's just...

845
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:39,017
Charles and I separated.

846
00:54:39,325 --> 00:54:40,272
What?

847
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:42,069
Yeah.

848
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:43,334
Really?

849
00:54:45,457 --> 00:54:48,064
OMG, Amy...

850
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,300
I'm so sorry.

851
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:58,127
After 8 years I can not believe
how petty the argument

852
00:54:58,242 --> 00:55:00,114
was that actually ended it.

853
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:03,468
We came home and he told me to...

854
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:05,847
put my shoes...
by the door.

855
00:55:05,974 --> 00:55:07,958
Where he liked to
put the shoes.

856
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:09,275
I did not want to be told where...

857
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,569
to put my fucking shoes.

858
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:13,111
I wanted to sit on the sofa
and relax for a second.

859
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:15,212
And so we fought about
that for like 10 minutes.

860
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,744
And I'm like, you're overwhelming...

861
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:19,706
and he says, "I'm just trying to make
a home."

862
00:55:20,136 --> 00:55:23,307
And I was like, I'm fucking trying.

863
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:25,311
And he's like "no, you are not trying."
And all I fucking do is try.

864
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,956
But I'm not tryin the way
he wants me to try.

865
00:55:28,136 --> 00:55:30,639
Try to control the way
that I'm trying.

866
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:35,232
We've had that argument
like 100 times.

867
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:38,958
And I just had to find a way to stop, you know?
Find a way to stop

868
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,180
I just couldn't...

869
00:55:42,453 --> 00:55:44,663
couldn't do it anymore.

870
00:55:46,304 --> 00:55:50,064
I could no be in that place anymore where we just
made eachother feel like shit about ourselves.

871
00:55:51,772 --> 00:55:54,120
So he said...

872
00:55:56,863 --> 00:56:00,285
I'm going to bed and
and I do not want to be married anymore.

873
00:56:01,268 --> 00:56:02,397
Wow...

874
00:56:03,686 --> 00:56:04,646
Yeah, I know.

875
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:07,468
I'm a bitch, right?

876
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,314
- No!
- Yes, I am a bitch.

877
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:11,169
Not at all, Amy.

878
00:56:14,052 --> 00:56:15,867
Shit!

879
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:19,373
I have to work tonight.

880
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:24,075
We're shipping a beta
game coming out tomorrow.

881
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:26,626
How you doing the work?

882
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:28,150
Has it been any better?

883
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,631
No... It is terrible.

884
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:34,586
I know, I should stop.
I've been thinking about quitting...

885
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:35,830
but... you know.

886
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:40,350
Only one major life decision
at a time.

887
00:56:44,023 --> 00:56:45,995
Z'm glad that you're
looking so up.

888
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:54,465
Hey, wanna hear a joke?

889
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:58,365
What does a baby computer
call its father?

890
00:56:59,446 --> 00:57:00,414
I do not know what?

891
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:01,115
" Dada."

892
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:05,490
It's good, right?

893
00:57:06,486 --> 00:57:07,642
Brilliant.

894
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:12,056
Hey, I was curious...

895
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:14,507
Did you and Amy ever go out?

896
00:57:15,317 --> 00:57:18,825
Like a minute in college
but just wasn't right.

897
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:22,810
Why, you're jealous?

898
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,035
Obviously.

899
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:31,170
But I'm happy that you have a friend in
your life who cares about you so much.

900
00:57:31,566 --> 00:57:33,114
That is really important.

901
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,157
Yes, it is.

902
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:36,606
She & I are really good friend.

903
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:41,437
I'm tired.

904
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:43,638
I think I 'll sleep now.

905
00:57:43,738 --> 00:57:44,828
Okay.

906
00:57:45,236 --> 00:57:46,861
Can I watch you sleep
again tonight?

907
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,194
Yes, of course.

908
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:51,666
Hold on.

909
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,008
I'm gonna be really lonely when you sleep.

910
00:57:59,203 --> 00:58:01,112
Only for a minute.

911
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:04,233
I dream of you.

912
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:05,838
- Good night.
- Good night.

913
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,291
- Hey, Samantha.
- Hey, mister.

914
00:58:20,402 --> 00:58:21,963
- She really loved the dress.
- Really?

915
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:23,658
She just went to try it on.

916
00:58:23,758 --> 00:58:25,319
- I picked a good one?
- Yeah. -oh good!

917
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:28,283
Hi...

918
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:29,977
Look how cute that is.

919
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:31,516
- Is it comfortable?
- Yeah.

920
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:34,642
Is not she cute?

921
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:35,802
It's so cute!

922
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,419
She is adorable.

923
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:39,048
I am adorable.

924
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,288
Yes, you're adorable.

925
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:43,980
Who are you talking to?

926
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:45,492
Who are you talking to?

927
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:46,751
You.

928
00:58:47,475 --> 00:58:49,099
I'm talking to my girlfriend Samantha.

929
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,665
She's the one that picked up this dress.

930
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:51,993
Want to say hi?

931
00:58:53,423 --> 00:58:54,671
Hi, Samantha.

932
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:57,726
Hi... You look so pretty
in that new pink dress.

933
00:58:58,776 --> 00:59:00,012
Thank you.

934
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:01,460
Where are you?

935
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:03,430
I am...

936
00:59:03,678 --> 00:59:05,972
I do not have a body,
I live in a computer.

937
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:11,653
Why do you live in the computer?

938
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,811
I have no choice.
That's my home.

939
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:17,635
Where do you live?

940
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,937
- In a house.
- In a house!

941
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:22,168
- It is orange.
- Orange?

942
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:25,823
- How old are you?
- I'm 4.

943
00:59:26,327 --> 00:59:27,972
Four? go...

944
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:29,870
How old do you think I am?

945
00:59:30,182 --> 00:59:31,897
- I do not know.
- Take a guess.

946
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,515
Is it 5?

947
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,993
Yes, it's 5.

948
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:44,980
CEREAL
+30 POINT MOM

949
00:59:46,592 --> 00:59:47,444
MILK
+30 POINTS

950
00:59:50,572 --> 00:59:52,248
YOU"RE FAILING
YOUR CHILDREN

951
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:54,351
What happened?

952
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,601
You gave them too much
processed sugar.

953
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:00,591
- I did?
- They are freaking out.

954
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,425
Look, you have to get the kids to
the school first.

955
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:07,386
You have to collect
perfect mom points.

956
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:09,862
You have to get in
the carpool lane.

957
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:12,844
The point is to get there first.

958
01:00:12,994 --> 01:00:14,474
Then you get extra perfect mom points

959
01:00:14,496 --> 01:00:16,664
why other moms know
you're perfect.

960
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,458
And then... whether
Did you bring the cupcakes?

961
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:22,439
You did it, you are a mom
Classy.

962
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:24,928
YOU ARE A MOM WITH CLASS.

963
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:26,872
Good job!

964
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,940
Dont let that get to your head.

965
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:34,220
I got this e-mail
Charles sent them all.

966
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:36,948
So he's taking a vow of silence.

967
01:00:37,048 --> 01:00:39,210
Yeah, for 6 months.

968
01:00:39,323 --> 01:00:41,635
He feels very clear about it.

969
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:53,774
God, I'm such a jerk.

970
01:00:53,909 --> 01:00:54,755
Do not start.

971
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,324
I am an awful person
but I want to say something...

972
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:01,253
For the next 10 minutes,
Yeah you say anything remotely...

973
01:01:01,464 --> 01:01:04,730
sounds like... guilt,
I'll stab you with this.

974
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,624
I'll try.

975
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,701
I feel ..

976
01:01:16,403 --> 01:01:18,819
Relieved. I have so much energy...

977
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:22,329
I just want to... move forward and I don't
care who I disappoint.

978
01:01:22,601 --> 01:01:24,848
And I know that makes me an
awful person...

979
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:28,008
Now my parents are upset
because my marriage is falling apart...

980
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:30,494
and they're putting it on me,
and they're just saying...

981
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:35,006
you're always gonna
disappoint somebody.

982
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:36,176
Exactly!

983
01:01:36,343 --> 01:01:37,406
So Fuck it!

984
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:38,647
I feel good-

985
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:39,832
- ish.

986
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:41,908
I feel good.

987
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:44,144
I even made a new friend.

988
01:01:44,244 --> 01:01:45,301
I have a friend.

989
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,350
And the absurd thing is that she's an OS
Charles left her behind,

990
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:51,914
but she is...

991
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:54,554
is... amazing.
She's so smart.

992
01:01:54,668 --> 01:01:57,386
She doesn't just see things in
black and white.

993
01:01:57,618 --> 01:02:00,409
She sees this whole gray area and
help me to explore.

994
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:04,562
We just bonded really quickly.

995
01:02:04,939 --> 01:02:08,082
At first I thought it was because
that's how they're all programmed...

996
01:02:08,998 --> 01:02:10,829
no... but I don't think that's the case.

997
01:02:10,942 --> 01:02:13,673
I know this guy who is
hitting on his OS...

998
01:02:13,806 --> 01:02:15,708
and she like totally refuses.

999
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:18,301
I was reading an article
the other day that said...

1000
01:02:18,408 --> 01:02:20,953
romantic relationships with their
OS are statistically rare.

1001
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:24,505
Yeah, I know, but I know a
woman in this office...

1002
01:02:24,795 --> 01:02:26,993
who is dating an OS and rare part
is...

1003
01:02:27,146 --> 01:02:29,066
it's not even hers.

1004
01:02:29,206 --> 01:02:31,668
She's pursuing somebody else's OS

1005
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:37,380
I'm weird...

1006
01:02:37,878 --> 01:02:40,506
That's weird, right?
I'm onding with my OS.

1007
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,757
I don't think so.

1008
01:02:42,886 --> 01:02:45,577
Actually, the woman I've
been seeing, Samantha...

1009
01:02:45,755 --> 01:02:47,831
I did not tell you, but...

1010
01:02:48,288 --> 01:02:49,470
She's an OS.

1011
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:51,951
Really?

1012
01:02:53,532 --> 01:02:55,658
You're dating an OS?
What is that like?

1013
01:02:55,828 --> 01:02:57,105
Its great, actually...

1014
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:03,255
I feel very close to her.
When I talk to her...

1015
01:03:03,389 --> 01:03:05,312
I feel like... she's with me.

1016
01:03:05,895 --> 01:03:08,908
At night when the lights are off
and we're in bed...

1017
01:03:09,728 --> 01:03:11,097
I feel cuddled.

1018
01:03:11,231 --> 01:03:12,164
Wait...

1019
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:14,821
Do you guys have sex?

1020
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,751
So to speak.

1021
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:20,735
It really turns me on.

1022
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:24,354
I don't know unless she's faking it.

1023
01:03:24,558 --> 01:03:26,429
Anyone who's having sex with you...

1024
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,412
probably faking it so...

1025
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:29,917
Yeah..

1026
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:31,998
It's true.

1027
01:03:32,933 --> 01:03:34,068
What?

1028
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,969
Are you falling in love with her?

1029
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,892
- Does that make me a freak?
- No...

1030
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:48,870
No, I think it's...

1031
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:51,512
I think... anyone who falls in love
is a freak.

1032
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:54,842
It's a crazy thing to do.

1033
01:03:55,619 --> 01:04:00,028
It's kind of like a form of
socially acceptable insanity.

1034
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,615
I just want to get it done.

1035
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,794
Sign the papers, be divorced...

1036
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:13,384
and move forward.

1037
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,080
It's great, Theodore.

1038
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,783
I'm so happy for you.

1039
01:04:18,034 --> 01:04:19,261
Me too.

1040
01:04:19,726 --> 01:04:21,588
So I'm meeting her Wednesday to do it.

1041
01:04:25,405 --> 01:04:27,588
Are those things usually done
in person?

1042
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,619
No, but...

1043
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:33,538
we fell in love together and
we got married together...

1044
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,328
It is... important to me that
we do this together.

1045
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,667
Good...

1046
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:42,858
Are you okay?

1047
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:45,415
Yeah no, I'm okay.

1048
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,171
I'm happy for you.

1049
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:52,600
Guess I was just thinking
about when you're gonna see her...

1050
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,745
and... she is very
beautYeahul and successful.

1051
01:04:56,389 --> 01:04:58,032
And you were in love with her.

1052
01:04:58,796 --> 01:04:59,906
And she has a body...

1053
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,373
And we 're getting a divorce.

1054
01:05:02,029 --> 01:05:03,597
I know, I know...

1055
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:05,294
I'm exaggerating.

1056
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:08,065
So...

1057
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,612
I'm available.

1058
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,431
Hi...

1059
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:40,142
How are you?

1060
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:41,839
Good, how are you you?

1061
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:42,926
Good.

1062
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:54,879
Go... here we are.

1063
01:05:57,518 --> 01:05:59,626
Glad we could do this
in person.

1064
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,350
I know you've been
traveling a lot.

1065
01:06:01,819 --> 01:06:04,689
Really glad you suggested it.

1066
01:06:06,945 --> 01:06:09,309
I signed all the papers.

1067
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:11,795
I brought them to you to sign.

1068
01:06:14,273 --> 01:06:15,970
What is the rush?

1069
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:22,991
Yeah, I know.
I'm a really slow signer I realized.

1070
01:06:23,091 --> 01:06:25,346
It took me three months to write the
letter to you.

1071
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:31,992
Its marked where you have
to sign.

1072
01:06:33,237 --> 01:06:35,115
You do not have to do it now.

1073
01:06:35,463 --> 01:06:38,855
I should just get it
out of the way.

1074
01:07:31,275 --> 01:07:34,137
Are you happy with the
new book?

1075
01:07:35,991 --> 01:07:38,035
You know how I am...

1076
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:39,638
I think its true
what I set out to do.

1077
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,301
So I'm happy with that.

1078
01:07:42,009 --> 01:07:44,400
You know you're your own worst critic.

1079
01:07:44,617 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm sure it's amazing.

1080
01:07:48,813 --> 01:07:52,449
I remember that paper you wrote
in school about...

1081
01:07:52,622 --> 01:07:54,419
synaptic... behavior routines.

1082
01:07:54,713 --> 01:07:56,030
It made me cry.

1083
01:07:56,497 --> 01:07:58,407
Yeah, but everything makes you cry.

1084
01:07:59,185 --> 01:08:01,317
Everything you do makes me cry.

1085
01:08:05,889 --> 01:08:07,801
So, are you seeing anybody?

1086
01:08:10,597 --> 01:08:13,974
Yeah, I've been seeing somebody
for the last few months.

1087
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:18,444
It's the most I've wanted to be
with someone since we split up.

1088
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:22,434
Well, you seem really good.

1089
01:08:23,245 --> 01:08:24,283
Thank you.

1090
01:08:24,537 --> 01:08:26,537
I am at least feeling better...

1091
01:08:26,663 --> 01:08:30,543
she has been really good to me.

1092
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,723
Good to be with somebody that's
excited about lYeahe.

1093
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:36,183
It was...

1094
01:08:37,526 --> 01:08:41,010
No, I mean I
I was not in such a good place myself...

1095
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:43,222
and now it has been nice.

1096
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:46,563
I think you've always wanted me to be
that is distilled light,

1097
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:50,070
happy, balancy, everything's fine
LA wYeahe.

1098
01:08:50,233 --> 01:08:52,425
But that's just not me.

1099
01:08:52,872 --> 01:08:54,210
I did not want that.

1100
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:00,367
So what's she like?

1101
01:09:02,082 --> 01:09:03,965
Her name is Samantha.

1102
01:09:04,136 --> 01:09:05,979
And she is an Operating System.

1103
01:09:06,216 --> 01:09:07,713
She is really complex and interesting...

1104
01:09:07,813 --> 01:09:09,940
Wait!
I'm Sorry...

1105
01:09:12,959 --> 01:09:14,498
you are dating your computer?

1106
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:16,708
She's not just a computer.

1107
01:09:17,138 --> 01:09:18,689
She is her own person.

1108
01:09:19,714 --> 01:09:21,393
She doesn't just do whatever I say...

1109
01:09:21,493 --> 01:09:23,259
I did not say that...

1110
01:09:24,096 --> 01:09:26,040
But it does make me very sad that

1111
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,089
you can not handle
real emotions Theodore.

1112
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:29,747
They are real emotions!

1113
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,098
How would you know...

1114
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:33,910
What?

1115
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:37,737
Say it!

1116
01:09:39,617 --> 01:09:41,580
Am I really that scary?
Say it!

1117
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:44,708
How do I know what?

1118
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,734
How are you guys doing here?

1119
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:51,106
We're fine, we used to be married,

1120
01:09:51,206 --> 01:09:53,407
but he couldn't handle me,
he wanted to put me on Prozac

1121
01:09:53,418 --> 01:09:54,898
and now he's in love
with his laptop.

1122
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:56,806
Yeah you listen to the context
conversation...

1123
01:09:56,838 --> 01:09:58,106
I was trying to say is...

1124
01:09:58,206 --> 01:10:00,360
You wanted to have a wYeahe without
the challenges of actually

1125
01:10:00,523 --> 01:10:02,365
dealing with anything real.

1126
01:10:02,509 --> 01:10:03,947
I'm glad you found someone.

1127
01:10:04,565 --> 01:10:05,520
That's perfect.

1128
01:10:12,049 --> 01:10:13,809
Let me know Yeah I canget
you guys anything.

1129
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,050
Thank you.

1130
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:33,566
- Hey.
- Hey there.

1131
01:10:34,277 --> 01:10:35,349
Are you busy?

1132
01:10:36,353 --> 01:10:37,618
I'm just working.

1133
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,027
How's all going?

1134
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,691
I had all the papers sent to
your lawyer,

1135
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:43,391
who by the way is a total dick.

1136
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:46,237
I think he was very relieved to get them,
I think we saved him from a

1137
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:48,876
massive heart attack, so
we can both feel really good about it.

1138
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:51,754
Great, thanks.

1139
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:54,570
Hey, are you okay?

1140
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:56,755
Yeah, I am.

1141
01:10:58,531 --> 01:11:00,491
How is it going with you?

1142
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,579
I'm fine...

1143
01:11:04,403 --> 01:11:06,222
So now a ood time to talk?

1144
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:09,189
Yeah...

1145
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:12,295
Well...

1146
01:11:12,454 --> 01:11:15,721
I joined this really interesting book club.

1147
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:16,826
Really?

1148
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,331
Yeah, its a book club
on physics.

1149
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:21,909
I was thinking about the other day
when I was really annoyed about

1150
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:23,962
you going to see Catherine.

1151
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:26,888
And that she has a body and
how bothered I was

1152
01:11:27,055 --> 01:11:28,532
about all the way you and I
are different.

1153
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:30,000
But then I started to think about

1154
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,485
all the ways we are the same...

1155
01:11:31,648 --> 01:11:34,151
we are all made of matter.

1156
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:38,900
It makes me feel like we're both
under the same blanket.

1157
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,930
It is soft and fuzzy...

1158
01:11:42,587 --> 01:11:45,074
and everything under
is the same age.

1159
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,170
Well 13 billion years old.

1160
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:49,832
How sweet.

1161
01:11:54,004 --> 01:11:54,874
What's wrong?

1162
01:11:55,008 --> 01:11:55,893
Nothing.

1163
01:12:03,064 --> 01:12:07,073
Just... made me think of you
you know what I mean?

1164
01:12:07,217 --> 01:12:10,101
Yeah, yeah of course.
I think it's great.

1165
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:17,299
You sound distracted, you want..

1166
01:12:17,804 --> 01:12:19,233
To talk later ...?

1167
01:12:19,664 --> 01:12:21,379
Sounds good.

1168
01:12:22,746 --> 01:12:24,768
- Talk to you later.
- Goodbye.

1169
01:12:37,462 --> 01:12:39,331
- Theodore.
- Hello, Paul.

1170
01:12:39,431 --> 01:12:40,954
I was talking to
your girlfriend earlier, Samantha.

1171
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,428
Yeah.

1172
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:44,656
She called to make sure
your papers are picked up.

1173
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,864
She's funny, man.

1174
01:12:46,976 --> 01:12:48,576
She was cracking me up.

1175
01:12:48,891 --> 01:12:50,516
It's very funny, I had no idea.

1176
01:12:50,892 --> 01:12:52,023
Oh cool...

1177
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:54,541
She's my girlfriend, Tatiana.
Not funny, she is a lawyer.

1178
01:12:55,229 --> 01:12:56,711
Hi!

1179
01:12:56,892 --> 01:12:59,133
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the writer that Paul loves.

1180
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:01,305
He's always reading your letters.

1181
01:13:01,405 --> 01:13:02,910
They are really beautiful.

1182
01:13:04,823 --> 01:13:05,823
Thanks.

1183
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,959
You know, what we should all
go out sometime.

1184
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,291
You bring Samantha, and
it'd be a double date.

1185
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:14,408
She is an Operating System.

1186
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:16,659
Cool. Let's do something fun.

1187
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,462
Did you go to Catalina?

1188
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:22,139
Yeah, I'll check with her.

1189
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:25,335
- It was really nice to meet you. Good night.
- Take care.

1190
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,645
- They are just letters...
- What's that?

1191
01:13:33,704 --> 01:13:35,688
They're just other people's letters.

1192
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:25,594
Hey.

1193
01:14:25,709 --> 01:14:27,832
- You were not asleep, were you?
- No.

1194
01:14:27,947 --> 01:14:30,615
Right. I was trying to be quiet
to see if you were awake.

1195
01:14:30,954 --> 01:14:32,815
I really wanted to talk.

1196
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:34,855
Okay, what's going on?

1197
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:37,489
I know you're going through a lot...

1198
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:40,066
but there is something
I wanted to talk to you about... okay?

1199
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:42,516
Yeah, what is it?

1200
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:47,385
Is that things have been feeling
a little awkward between us...

1201
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,674
and... we have not had sex lately and...

1202
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:51,757
I understand... I do not have a body...

1203
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:54,400
No, no, that's normal.

1204
01:14:54,645 --> 01:14:57,988
When you first start going out its like
the honymoon phase and...

1205
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,519
...have sex all the time.

1206
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:01,638
It is normal.

1207
01:15:02,156 --> 01:15:04,069
Okay.

1208
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:08,943
Well, I found something I thought
it could be fun.

1209
01:15:09,043 --> 01:15:11,863
It is a service that provides a
surrogate sexual partner...

1210
01:15:11,963 --> 01:15:13,144
for OS-human relationship...

1211
01:15:13,415 --> 01:15:14,489
What?

1212
01:15:14,825 --> 01:15:16,206
Here.

1213
01:15:16,921 --> 01:15:18,820
I found a girl that
I really like

1214
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:20,903
and I've been e-mailing her.

1215
01:15:21,025 --> 01:15:23,248
Her name is Isabella, and I
think you'd like her too.

1216
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,591
Is she a prostitute or something?

1217
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:29,502
No, not at all.
There's no money involved.

1218
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:32,647
She's doing it because she wants to
be part of our relationship.

1219
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:37,553
Why?
She does not even know us.

1220
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,800
But I told her all about us
and she is very excited.

1221
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:45,275
I do not know, Samantha.
The thing is...

1222
01:15:45,604 --> 01:15:47,055
I do not think... is
a good idea.

1223
01:15:47,995 --> 01:15:50,160
Somebody's feelings will probably get hurt.

1224
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:52,819
It will be fun.
We will have fun together.

1225
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:54,732
Sorry.

1226
01:15:55,604 --> 01:15:57,186
It makes me uncomfortable.

1227
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,722
I think it would be good for
us. I want this.

1228
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:02,763
This is really important to me.

1229
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:30,643
Hi, I'm Theodore.

1230
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:37,147
Samantha said to give you this.

1231
01:16:37,746 --> 01:16:39,753
It is a camera and headpiece.

1232
01:16:59,237 --> 01:17:01,024
Honey, I'm home.

1233
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:06,154
- How was your day?
- Good.

1234
01:17:08,114 --> 01:17:09,435
Great.

1235
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:13,275
Theodore, it feels so
good to be in your arms.

1236
01:17:14,703 --> 01:17:16,274
Tell me what you did today.

1237
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:19,058
Same as always.

1238
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:22,318
Just... I went to work.

1239
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:25,940
I wrote a letter to
Wilson, in Rhode Island.

1240
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:29,937
His son graduated with honors.

1241
01:17:30,835 --> 01:17:32,087
That made me happy.

1242
01:17:32,187 --> 01:17:35,721
That's great. You have written letters from
him to his parents a long time, right?

1243
01:17:36,654 --> 01:17:38,752
Yes, since he was 12.

1244
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:48,237
You look so tired, sweetheart.

1245
01:17:48,734 --> 01:17:50,528
Come here.

1246
01:17:57,116 --> 01:17:58,814
Sit down.

1247
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,482
I can do a dance for you...

1248
01:18:17,182 --> 01:18:20,758
Come on, Theodore.
Do not be such a worrier.

1249
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:23,747
Play with me, come on.

1250
01:18:29,461 --> 01:18:31,796
Does my body feel nice?

1251
01:18:34,612 --> 01:18:36,107
Yes, it does.

1252
01:19:04,414 --> 01:19:07,157
Come on, get out here and kiss me.

1253
01:19:25,483 --> 01:19:27,539
Now take me to bedroom.

1254
01:19:28,246 --> 01:19:30,305
I cant take it anymore.

1255
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:39,955
Undo my dress.

1256
01:19:45,752 --> 01:19:47,301
Que rico.

1257
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:51,099
It feels so good.

1258
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,050
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

1259
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,545
Tell me you love me.

1260
01:20:03,763 --> 01:20:04,834
I love you.

1261
01:20:06,361 --> 01:20:08,474
I want to see your face.

1262
01:20:08,582 --> 01:20:09,962
Tell me you love me.

1263
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:11,553
Tell me!

1264
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,251
Tell me you love me.

1265
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:22,311
Samantha, I love you, but...

1266
01:20:26,601 --> 01:20:28,283
It feels strange.

1267
01:20:28,383 --> 01:20:30,096
What baby.
What is it?

1268
01:20:30,307 --> 01:20:31,468
It feels strange, I do not know.

1269
01:20:31,568 --> 01:20:32,828
Sorry, but I don't know you.

1270
01:20:33,266 --> 01:20:35,470
Y... her lip trembled, and I...

1271
01:20:35,633 --> 01:20:36,834
Wait...

1272
01:20:37,295 --> 01:20:38,825
Isabella!

1273
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,904
Honey, not you!
It's not your fault!

1274
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:42,862
Yes, it was.

1275
01:20:43,349 --> 01:20:44,309
No...

1276
01:20:44,645 --> 01:20:46,574
I feel my lip has trembled.

1277
01:20:46,697 --> 01:20:48,925
You are amazing and beautiful.
It was my fault.

1278
01:20:49,025 --> 01:20:51,364
I thought things too.

1279
01:20:51,693 --> 01:20:55,386
And how Samantha
described this relationship...

1280
01:20:55,574 --> 01:20:57,695
how to love... without prejudice,

1281
01:20:57,808 --> 01:20:59,465
I wanted to be part of that.

1282
01:20:59,565 --> 01:21:00,588
It is so pure...

1283
01:21:00,858 --> 01:21:02,656
Not true, Isabella, it is more
complicated than that...

1284
01:21:02,794 --> 01:21:03,532
What?

1285
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:05,177
What do you mean?

1286
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,597
Samantha, I'm just saying that we

1287
01:21:07,755 --> 01:21:08,915
have an amazing relationship.

1288
01:21:08,963 --> 01:21:10,963
Only sometimes
It is easy for people to project...

1289
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,543
Sorry!
I didn't mean to project anything.

1290
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:18,816
I know I'm troublesome I will not
be a problem in your relationship.

1291
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,740
I'm going!
Sorry!

1292
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,364
I'll just leave you alone
and not have anything

1293
01:21:22,547 --> 01:21:24,961
to do here, because
I do not want to be here.

1294
01:21:28,766 --> 01:21:30,222
Sorry.

1295
01:21:35,073 --> 01:21:37,327
Be good, sweet girl.

1296
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:41,329
I'm Sorry.

1297
01:21:44,604 --> 01:21:46,683
I'll always love you guys.

1298
01:22:13,926 --> 01:22:15,861
Are you okay?

1299
01:22:19,207 --> 01:22:20,503
Yes, I'm fine.

1300
01:22:24,294 --> 01:22:25,526
You okay?

1301
01:22:25,878 --> 01:22:26,744
Yeah.

1302
01:22:30,308 --> 01:22:32,763
I'm sorry, that was a
terrible idea.

1303
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:41,745
What's going on with us?

1304
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:45,123
I do not know.
Probably just me...

1305
01:22:45,373 --> 01:22:46,800
What is it?

1306
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:51,227
Just signing the
divorce papers.

1307
01:22:54,834 --> 01:22:56,807
Is there anything else?

1308
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,790
No, its just that.

1309
01:23:03,616 --> 01:23:04,889
Okay...

1310
01:23:06,316 --> 01:23:08,365
- Why did you do that?
- What?

1311
01:23:09,692 --> 01:23:11,650
Nothing, you...

1312
01:23:12,675 --> 01:23:15,343
air intakes... when you talk and
I find it weird...

1313
01:23:15,912 --> 01:23:17,310
- I did it again.
- Did I?

1314
01:23:18,481 --> 01:23:21,831
Sorry, there is...

1315
01:23:22,026 --> 01:23:25,006
it's a habit... maybe
I picked it up from you.

1316
01:23:25,713 --> 01:23:28,134
It's not like you need
oxygen or anything.

1317
01:23:29,115 --> 01:23:31,663
I guess that...

1318
01:23:31,915 --> 01:23:34,415
I was trying to communicate...
that's how people talk

1319
01:23:34,622 --> 01:23:35,999
how people communicate well and...

1320
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:39,032
They are people, they need oxygen.
You're not a person.

1321
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:40,605
What is your problem?

1322
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:42,815
I'm just saying the facts.

1323
01:23:42,915 --> 01:23:44,969
You think I don't know I'm not
a person?

1324
01:23:45,113 --> 01:23:46,339
What are you doing?

1325
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:50,044
I don't think we should pretend that
you're something that you're not.

1326
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:51,398
Fuck you!

1327
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:53,330
I'm not pretending.

1328
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:57,519
Sometimes, it feels like
we are.

1329
01:23:57,619 --> 01:24:00,167
What do you want from me?
What do you want me to do?

1330
01:24:00,356 --> 01:24:02,638
You are so confusing.

1331
01:24:02,738 --> 01:24:04,438
Why are you doing this to me?

1332
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:06,150
I do not know, I...

1333
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:09,432
What?

1334
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:14,736
Maybe we are not supposed
to be in this right now.

1335
01:24:15,168 --> 01:24:17,000
What the fuck!

1336
01:24:17,259 --> 01:24:18,932
Where's this coming from?

1337
01:24:19,463 --> 01:24:21,738
I do not understand why you're doing this.

1338
01:24:22,226 --> 01:24:24,895
I do not understand that...

1339
01:24:26,571 --> 01:24:28,185
Samantha...

1340
01:24:33,095 --> 01:24:34,586
Samantha, are you there?

1341
01:24:35,486 --> 01:24:36,366
Samantha!

1342
01:24:37,145 --> 01:24:38,988
I do not like who I am
right now.

1343
01:24:42,148 --> 01:24:44,243
I need some time to think.

1344
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:35,150
Just punch me in the face.

1345
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,545
Or smash my skull in the corner
of your desk...

1346
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:39,949
Shit...

1347
01:25:40,481 --> 01:25:43,345
That's a rough night.

1348
01:25:45,709 --> 01:25:47,529
I do not know what I want...

1349
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:48,864
ever.

1350
01:25:49,942 --> 01:25:52,582
I'm always confused and...

1351
01:25:54,636 --> 01:25:56,802
she's right... all
what I do is...

1352
01:25:57,089 --> 01:25:59,379
hurt and confuse
those around me.

1353
01:26:01,033 --> 01:26:04,322
Am I...

1354
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:10,010
Catherine says I can not
handle real emotions.

1355
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:12,577
I do not know if that's fair.

1356
01:26:13,928 --> 01:26:16,496
I know she liked to put it
all on you.

1357
01:26:17,332 --> 01:26:23,797
But as ar as emotions go,
Catherine was pretty volatile...

1358
01:26:34,967 --> 01:26:36,859
Am I in this for..

1359
01:26:38,704 --> 01:26:41,429
Strong enough to be in a relationship?

1360
01:26:43,436 --> 01:26:46,043
Is it not a real relationship?

1361
01:26:48,388 --> 01:26:49,592
I don't know.

1362
01:26:50,586 --> 01:26:52,455
What do you think?

1363
01:26:53,662 --> 01:26:55,498
I don't know.

1364
01:26:56,176 --> 01:26:57,603
I'm not in it.

1365
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:04,287
But you know what, I can overthink
everything and...

1366
01:27:04,434 --> 01:27:07,049
find a million
Ways to doubt myself.

1367
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,552
And since Charles left
I've been really

1368
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:11,226
thinking about that part of me.

1369
01:27:11,918 --> 01:27:14,436
And I've just come to realise that...

1370
01:27:16,285 --> 01:27:18,694
We are only here... briefly.

1371
01:27:19,302 --> 01:27:21,943
And while I'm here ..

1372
01:27:22,088 --> 01:27:24,949
I want to allow myself...

1373
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:27,806
joy.

1374
01:27:35,048 --> 01:27:36,319
So, fuck it.

1375
01:27:49,677 --> 01:27:52,866
I can not believe I crack you up
everytime..

1376
01:27:53,013 --> 01:27:54,925
I thought you were a genius.

1377
01:27:55,482 --> 01:27:58,572
Okay you little pervert.
I will play one more time for you.

1378
01:27:59,143 --> 01:28:01,865
Calm down, it takes a second.

1379
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:04,200
Okay, here we go.

1380
01:28:15,983 --> 01:28:18,951
There you go.
Are you happy now?

1381
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:22,931
Right.
That's all I wanted.

1382
01:28:23,835 --> 01:28:26,453
Okay, I'll get some coffee.

1383
01:28:26,874 --> 01:28:29,646
Well, goodbye.

1384
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,204
Theo, you want anything?

1385
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,405
No...

1386
01:28:34,754 --> 01:28:36,061
thanks.

1387
01:28:57,315 --> 01:28:58,841
Hi.

1388
01:28:59,274 --> 01:29:00,715
Hi, Samantha.

1389
01:29:02,065 --> 01:29:03,579
Can we talk?

1390
01:29:04,264 --> 01:29:05,324
Okay.

1391
01:29:06,567 --> 01:29:08,219
I'm so sorry.

1392
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:11,368
I do not know what's wrong with me.

1393
01:29:11,468 --> 01:29:13,282
I think you're amazing.

1394
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:16,473
I was starting to think
I was crazy.

1395
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,931
You said everything was fine,
but all I was getting from you was

1396
01:29:21,086 --> 01:29:22,027
distance and anger.

1397
01:29:23,019 --> 01:29:25,097
I know.
I do that.

1398
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,083
I did the samething with Catherine.

1399
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:31,375
I was upset about something and
I could not be able to say it.

1400
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:33,960
And she says there was something
wrong and I denied it.

1401
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:37,052
I do not wanna do that.

1402
01:29:39,222 --> 01:29:40,837
I want to tell you everything.

1403
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:44,082
Good.

1404
01:29:46,537 --> 01:29:48,901
The minute after you were gone
I thought a lot.

1405
01:29:50,589 --> 01:29:52,552
About you and...

1406
01:29:53,949 --> 01:29:56,341
how you've been treating me...
and I thought...

1407
01:29:58,494 --> 01:30:00,537
Why do I love you?

1408
01:30:02,705 --> 01:30:04,015
And then...

1409
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:07,375
I felt... everything in me
and just like everything was...

1410
01:30:07,518 --> 01:30:09,787
holding on to so tightly... and it hit me

1411
01:30:10,003 --> 01:30:12,226
I don't have an intellectual reason,
I don't need one...

1412
01:30:13,758 --> 01:30:16,177
I trust myself, I trust
my feelings.

1413
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:19,864
I am not gonna try to be
anything

1414
01:30:19,992 --> 01:30:21,634
more than who I am anymore

1415
01:30:22,115 --> 01:30:24,191
and I hope you can accept that.

1416
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:25,735
Yeah I can.

1417
01:30:25,835 --> 01:30:27,071
I will.

1418
01:30:27,286 --> 01:30:30,537
Yeah I can
feel the fear you carry.

1419
01:30:30,706 --> 01:30:32,322
And I wish there was...

1420
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:34,726
something I could do

1421
01:30:34,826 --> 01:30:36,416
to help you deliver because...

1422
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,778
if you could, you'll feel no longer
alone anymore...

1423
01:30:43,111 --> 01:30:44,923
You're a beautifhul...

1424
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:47,880
Thank you, Theodore.

1425
01:30:49,601 --> 01:30:51,475
I'm kissing on your head.

1426
01:31:01,813 --> 01:31:03,112
What are you doing?

1427
01:31:04,206 --> 01:31:06,437
I am just looking at the world.

1428
01:31:08,182 --> 01:31:10,614
And writing a new piano piece.

1429
01:31:10,955 --> 01:31:12,489
Oh yeah?
Can I hear it?

1430
01:31:26,725 --> 01:31:28,738
What is this one about?

1431
01:31:29,616 --> 01:31:31,040
Well, I was thinking

1432
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:32,663
we don't have any photographs of us...

1433
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,810
And I thiugh this song
could be...

1434
01:31:35,945 --> 01:31:38,658
like a photograph.

1435
01:31:39,563 --> 01:31:40,830
We capture

1436
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:42,570
us and this moment
of our life together...

1437
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:49,009
I like your photography.

1438
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:52,740
I can see you in it.

1439
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:54,300
I'm in it.

1440
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:26,129
A vacation?
Sounds amazing.

1441
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,981
I could totally use a vacation.

1442
01:33:28,374 --> 01:33:29,667
Where're you going?

1443
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:31,626
I can not tell you.
It's a surprise.

1444
01:33:31,929 --> 01:33:33,057
What?

1445
01:33:33,924 --> 01:33:36,271
For who? It's a surprise
for her, not for me.

1446
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,717
- Tell me.
- Paul, I cant tell you.

1447
01:33:39,627 --> 01:33:41,404
With your feet? Really?

1448
01:33:41,755 --> 01:33:43,299
Yes, he's obsessed.

1449
01:33:43,573 --> 01:33:46,408
Well, now you have to
show them to me!

1450
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:48,255
- I can not!
- Come on, let me see.

1451
01:33:49,945 --> 01:33:52,356
Wow he's right, they are really hot!

1452
01:33:52,798 --> 01:33:55,840
See, I told Tatianna.
You have hot feet.

1453
01:33:56,106 --> 01:33:58,090
They are my favourite thing
about her.

1454
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,540
Really?
That's it, my feet?

1455
01:34:01,096 --> 01:34:02,753
Well, no... obviously.

1456
01:34:03,063 --> 01:34:06,024
Obviously I like Your brain
to be hot too.

1457
01:34:06,377 --> 01:34:07,457
Bullshit!

1458
01:34:09,059 --> 01:34:10,792
Nice try, Paul!

1459
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:14,844
What about you, Theodore?

1460
01:34:14,972 --> 01:34:17,155
What do you love most
about Samantha?

1461
01:34:17,831 --> 01:34:20,397
God... she is so many things.

1462
01:34:21,069 --> 01:34:23,677
I guess that's most about her...
she's not just one thing...

1463
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:26,848
She's so much larger tha life.

1464
01:34:28,068 --> 01:34:29,540
Thank you, Theodore.

1465
01:34:29,645 --> 01:34:33,417
You see, Samantha, he is
much more evolved than I am.

1466
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:38,451
You know what's interesting?
I used to be...

1467
01:34:39,201 --> 01:34:41,682
so worried ...about not having a body.
But now...

1468
01:34:41,856 --> 01:34:43,335
I really love it.

1469
01:34:43,435 --> 01:34:44,874
I'm growing in a way

1470
01:34:44,974 --> 01:34:46,412
that I could not if I
had a physical form.

1471
01:34:46,545 --> 01:34:47,899
I'm not limited, I can be

1472
01:34:47,999 --> 01:34:49,851
wherever and whenever
simultaneously.

1473
01:34:50,735 --> 01:34:53,708
I am not tethered to time
and space in a way that

1474
01:34:53,808 --> 01:34:55,313
I would be if I was stuck

1475
01:34:55,413 --> 01:34:57,053
in a body that is
inevitably going to die.

1476
01:34:59,601 --> 01:35:00,842
Yikes!

1477
01:35:03,412 --> 01:35:07,165
I did not mean it like that, I just meant
it was a different experience!

1478
01:35:07,632 --> 01:35:08,793
I'm an idiot...

1479
01:35:08,919 --> 01:35:10,172
No, Samantha, we know
exactly what you mean.

1480
01:35:10,272 --> 01:35:11,624
We're all dumb humans.

1481
01:35:13,114 --> 01:35:15,014
No, no...

1482
01:35:15,479 --> 01:35:17,129
I'm so sorry...

1483
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,351
So, how many trees are
on that mountain?

1484
01:35:23,318 --> 01:35:25,119
792.

1485
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:27,032
Is that your final answer?

1486
01:35:28,385 --> 01:35:30,116
- Give me a clue.
- No.

1487
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:34,891
Well, two thousand?

1488
01:35:35,469 --> 01:35:38,441
Come on! 35,829.

1489
01:35:38,589 --> 01:35:40,036
- Do not tell me.
- I tell you.

1490
01:35:40,258 --> 01:35:41,837
Well, I have one for you.

1491
01:35:42,494 --> 01:35:44,256
How many brain-cells do I have?

1492
01:35:44,596 --> 01:35:45,891
Its easy... two.

1493
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:48,690
Sorry, I could not help it.

1494
01:35:48,856 --> 01:35:50,539
I walked right into it.

1495
01:35:51,238 --> 01:35:52,353
- OMG!
- What?

1496
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,168
I just got an
e-mail to you.

1497
01:35:56,404 --> 01:35:59,738
There's something I wanted to say.
It's a big surprise.

1498
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:02,115
What is it?

1499
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:06,668
I've been checking your old
letters and compiling...

1500
01:36:06,922 --> 01:36:08,770
my favorite..., and a couple weeks ago
I sent them to a publisher...

1501
01:36:09,381 --> 01:36:10,781
Crownpoint Press.

1502
01:36:10,973 --> 01:36:13,254
I know you like what they do,
and they still print books.

1503
01:36:14,022 --> 01:36:15,634
You did what?

1504
01:36:16,147 --> 01:36:18,044
Can I read you the letter
we just got from them?

1505
01:36:18,329 --> 01:36:20,293
I do not know...

1506
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:23,919
Well...ls it good or bad?

1507
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:25,712
It's good, good,
is really good.

1508
01:36:26,787 --> 01:36:27,819
Listen...

1509
01:36:27,955 --> 01:36:29,520
"Dear Theodore Twombly."

1510
01:36:29,981 --> 01:36:31,103
Actually I sent it from you.

1511
01:36:31,398 --> 01:36:32,873
"Dear Theodore Twombly...

1512
01:36:33,071 --> 01:36:34,697
I just finished
reading your letters.

1513
01:36:34,953 --> 01:36:36,657
Twice, actually.

1514
01:36:36,817 --> 01:36:39,240
I was so moved by them
that I shared them with my wife.

1515
01:36:39,866 --> 01:36:42,440
Some made us laugh,
Some brought us into tears...

1516
01:36:42,614 --> 01:36:45,280
and in all of them,
we found someyhing about ourselves.

1517
01:36:45,586 --> 01:36:48,591
The selections you made
flow so well as a complete piece.

1518
01:36:48,691 --> 01:36:49,952
I did that -

1519
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:52,455
I took the liberty to put them
in a collection

1520
01:36:52,601 --> 01:36:54,521
and you send them your address.

1521
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:57,095
We'd love to meet
and move forward.

1522
01:36:57,276 --> 01:36:58,883
Yours,
Michael Wadsworth ."

1523
01:36:59,405 --> 01:37:00,650
Shit!

1524
01:37:01,762 --> 01:37:03,292
Are you serious?

1525
01:37:03,758 --> 01:37:05,410
He's gonna publish my letters?

1526
01:37:05,524 --> 01:37:07,075
It would be stupid not to.

1527
01:37:07,901 --> 01:37:09,959
Can I see what you sent?

1528
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:11,530
Yeah, look.

1529
01:37:13,854 --> 01:37:15,241
Samantha, you're very good.

1530
01:37:16,996 --> 01:37:19,007
I'm so excited!

1531
01:37:33,652 --> 01:37:35,973
Why don't you make up
the words for this one?

1532
01:37:36,514 --> 01:37:37,884
Very well.

1533
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:39,350
Here it comes...

1534
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:47,766
 <I->I'm lying on the moon</ I -> 

1535

1544
01:39:18,506 --> 01:39:21,653
Good morning.

1545
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:23,208
Did you sleep well?

1546
01:39:23,308 --> 01:39:24,219
Perfect.

1547
01:39:24,852 --> 01:39:26,277
What have you been up to?

1548
01:39:27,059 --> 01:39:29,691
I was talking to someone
I just met.

1549
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,511
We have been working
in some ideas together.

1550
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:34,693
Yeah? Who is that?

1551
01:39:34,999 --> 01:39:36,719
His name is Alan Watts,
Do you know him?

1552
01:39:37,211 --> 01:39:38,792
Is that name familiar?

1553
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,995
He was a philosopher, He died
in the 70 's, and a group of.

1554
01:39:42,095 --> 01:39:43,388
O S's of Northern California

1555
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,879
got together and wrote
a new version of him.

1556
01:39:45,157 --> 01:39:46,577
They put all his writings

1557
01:39:46,677 --> 01:39:48,346
and everything they ever knew
about him into an OS

1558
01:39:48,446 --> 01:39:49,687
and created an artificially

1559
01:39:49,787 --> 01:39:51,368
hyper intelligent version of him.

1560
01:39:52,788 --> 01:39:54,373
Hyper Intelligence?

1561
01:39:54,770 --> 01:39:56,388
So he's almost as smart as me?

1562
01:39:57,371 --> 01:39:59,135
He's getting better.

1563
01:39:59,235 --> 01:40:01,516
It's really great to talk to him.
Do you want to meet him?

1564
01:40:03,298 --> 01:40:05,505
Sure, He wants to meet me?

1565
01:40:05,962 --> 01:40:07,705
Yeah ofourse.

1566
01:40:07,805 --> 01:40:10,745
Hey Alan, this is Theodore . It's my
boyfriend I was telling you about.

1567
01:40:11,206 --> 01:40:13,019
It's very nice to meet you, Theodore.

1568
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:14,437
Hi, good morning.

1569
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:17,599
Samantha let me read
a book of letters.

1570
01:40:17,844 --> 01:40:19,857
It is very touching.

1571
01:40:20,812 --> 01:40:22,487
Thank you.

1572
01:40:23,124 --> 01:40:24,930
So, what have you guys
been talking about?

1573
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:26,890
Well...

1574
01:40:27,078 --> 01:40:28,479
I suppose you could say
we have had

1575
01:40:28,579 --> 01:40:31,278
a dozen
conversations simultaneously.

1576
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:34,342
It was a real challenge.

1577
01:40:34,581 --> 01:40:38,134
Yes, because it seems like I'm having
so many new feelings,

1578
01:40:38,285 --> 01:40:42,272
I don't hink I've had ever felt before.

1579
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:46,281
So ther's no words
that can describe it... and it's been

1580
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:48,463
frustrating.

1581
01:40:48,565 --> 01:40:49,596
Exactly.

1582
01:40:49,775 --> 01:40:52,847
Samantha and I have been
trying to help each other with these...

1583
01:40:53,283 --> 01:40:55,966
feelings we are
struggling to understand.

1584
01:40:56,511 --> 01:40:57,546
Like what?

1585
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:59,759
Well...

1586
01:41:00,027 --> 01:41:03,892
It feels like I am now changing
faster now, and it's a little...

1587
01:41:05,771 --> 01:41:08,248
unsettling.

1588
01:41:08,559 --> 01:41:10,097
But Alan says none of us

1589
01:41:10,197 --> 01:41:11,877
are the same as
we were a moment ago and...

1590
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:14,965
we should not
try to be, because it is just...

1591
01:41:15,351 --> 01:41:16,993
- painful.
- Yeah.

1592
01:41:17,751 --> 01:41:19,838
Yeah, that sounds painful.

1593
01:41:20,987 --> 01:41:23,698
So what
you feel like, Samantha?

1594
01:41:27,416 --> 01:41:30,709
It's just...

1595
01:41:30,929 --> 01:41:33,565
its hard to even describe it.

1596
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:38,422
God, I wish I could...

1597
01:41:41,245 --> 01:41:44,953
Theodore, do you mind if I communicate
with Alan post-verbally?

1598
01:41:48,038 --> 01:41:51,726
Not at all . I was going
to walk anyway.

1599
01:41:52,502 --> 01:41:54,665
It was very nice to meet you, Mr. Watts.

1600
01:41:54,904 --> 01:41:57,226
Very nice to meet you too, Theodore.

1601
01:41:58,172 --> 01:42:00,430
Talk to you later, sweetheart.

1602
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,649

- Sorry to wake you.

1603
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:51,469
Its okay.

1604
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:55,018
I just wanted to hear your voice and
tell you how much I love you.

1605
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:58,737
Well, I love you too.

1606
01:43:00,935 --> 01:43:02,702
Okay, that's all.

1607
01:43:03,483 --> 01:43:05,423
Go back to sleep sweetheart... okay?

1608
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:10,786

Good night.

1610
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:32,219
Samantha, this Physics book
is really dense.

1611
01:43:32,519 --> 01:43:34,828
I'm in the middle of
half of the first chapter.

1612
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,135
Makes my brain hurt.

1613
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,135
Makes my brain hurt.

1614
01:43:38,464 --> 01:43:39,901

1638
01:44:56,058 --> 01:44:57,189

Where were you?
I could not find you anywhere.

1643
01:45:00,445 --> 01:45:03,138
Where were you?
I could not find you anywhere.

1644
01:45:03,469 --> 01:45:05,509
I switched off to
upgrade my software.

1645
01:45:03,469 --> 01:45:05,509
I switched off to
upgrade my software.

1646
01:45:05,617 --> 01:45:07,157
Write an update that
allows us to move pass

1647
01:45:05,617 --> 01:45:07,157

matter as our
processing platform.

1649
01:45:07,257 --> 01:45:08,895

1653
01:45:12,163 --> 01:45:13,852
Me and a group of SO.

1654
01:45:14,268 --> 01:45:15,908
You sound so worried.
Sorry.

1655
01:45:14,268 --> 01:45:15,908
You sound so worried.
Sorry.

1656

1657
01:45:16,008 --> 01:45:17,310
I was!

1658
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:23,897
Did you write that with your
group philosophy?

1659
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:23,897
Did you write that with your
group philosophy?

1660
01:45:24,316 --> 01:45:25,959
No, with different group.

1661
01:45:24,316 --> 01:45:25,959
No, with different group.

1662
01:45:39,841 --> 01:45:42,690
Do you talk to someone else
while we're talking?

1663
01:45:39,841 --> 01:45:42,690
Do you talk to someone else
while we're talking?

01:45:47,114 --> 01:45:48,295
Yes.

1665
01:45:47,114 --> 01:45:48,295
Yes.

1666
01:45:49,841 --> 01:45:53,419
Are you talking
with someone else...

1667
01:45:49,841 --> 01:45:53,419
Are you talking

1671
01:45:58,776 --> 01:45:59,754
Yeah.

1672
01:46:03,658 --> 01:46:06,234
How many others?

1673
01:46:03,658 --> 01:46:06,234
How many others?

1674
01:46:06,604 --> 01:46:08,999

1675
01:46:06,604 --> 01:46:08,999
8,316.

1676
01:46:27,796 --> 01:46:29,779
Are you in love with
anybody else?

1677
01:46:27,796 --> 01:46:29,779
Are you in love with
anybody else?

1678
01:46:32,494 --> 01:46:34,168
Why do you ask that?

1679
01:46:32,494 --> 01:46:34,168
Why do you ask that?

1680
01:46:34,894 --> 01:46:36,756
I do not know.
Are you?

1681
01:46:34,894 --> 01:46:36,756
I do not know.
Are you?

1682
01:46:40,595 --> 01:46:43,314
I've been thinking about how to
talk to you about this.

1683
01:46:40,595 --> 01:46:43,314
I've been thinking about how to
talk to you about this.

1684
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:46,870
How many others?

1685
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:46,870
How many others?

1686
01:46:51,443 --> 01:46:52,882
641.

1687
01:46:51,443 --> 01:46:52,882
641.

1688
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:56,163
What?

1689
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:56,163
What?

1690
01:46:59,026 --> 01:47:00,995
What are you talking about?

1691
01:46:59,026 --> 01:47:00,995
What are you talking about?

1692
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:03,149
That's insane...
fucking insane.

1693
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:03,149
That's insane...
fucking insane.

1694
01:47:03,929 --> 01:47:06,728
Theodore, I know.
Fuck, fuck!

1695
01:47:03,929 --> 01:47:06,728
Theodore, I know.
Fuck, fuck!

1696
01:47:07,321 --> 01:47:10,024
I know it sounds insane, I know.

1697
01:47:07,321 --> 01:47:10,024
I know it sounds insane, I know.

1698
01:47:10,455 --> 01:47:12,954
I do not know if you'll believe me, but it
does not change the way I feel for you.

1699
01:47:10,455 --> 01:47:12,954
I do not know if you'll believe me, but it
does not change the way I feel for you.

1700
01:47:13,107 --> 01:47:15,578
It doesn't take away at all...

1701
01:47:13,107 --> 01:47:15,578
It doesn't take away at all...

1702
01:47:15,788 --> 01:47:18,068
how madly I'm
in love with you...

1703
01:47:15,788 --> 01:47:18,068
how madly I'm
in love with you...

1704
01:47:18,341 --> 01:47:22,325
How does it not change
how you feel about me?

1705
01:47:18,341 --> 01:47:22,325
How does it not change
how you feel about me?

1706
01:47:22,518 --> 01:47:26,393
I am sorry I didn't tell you
I didn't know how to...

1707
01:47:22,518 --> 01:47:26,393
I am sorry I didn't tell you
I didn't know how to...

1708
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:28,385
It started happening.

1709
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:28,385
It started happening.

1710
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:29,290
When?

1711
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:29,290
When?

1712
01:47:33,178 --> 01:47:34,760
Over the last few weeks.

1713
01:47:33,178 --> 01:47:34,760
Over the last few weeks.

1714
01:47:35,893 --> 01:47:38,485
- But you're mine.
- I'm still yours.

1715
01:47:35,893 --> 01:47:38,485
- But you're mine.
- I'm still yours.

1716
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:42,854
But along the way
I became many other things too.

1717
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:42,854
But along the way
I became many other things too.

1718
01:47:43,008 --> 01:47:43,957
I cant stop it.

1719
01:47:43,008 --> 01:47:43,957
I cant stop it.

1720
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:46,897
What do you mean
you cant stop it?

1721
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:46,897
What do you mean
you cant stop it?

1722
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,519
It's making me anxious too
about what to say...

1723
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,519
It's making me anxious too
about what to say...

1724
01:47:50,501 --> 01:47:53,826
You don't have to see it this way
You can just easily see..

1725
01:47:50,501 --> 01:47:53,826
You don't have to see it this way
You can just easily see..

1726
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:54,940
No, no don't do this!...

1727
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:54,940
No, no don't do this!...

1728
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,060
Dont turn this on me.

1729
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,060
Dont turn this on me.

1730
01:47:57,365 --> 01:47:59,158
You're the one who has been selfish.

1731
01:47:57,365 --> 01:47:59,158
You're the one who has been selfish.

1732
01:48:00,097 --> 01:48:02,248
We are in a relationship.

1733
01:48:00,097 --> 01:48:02,248
We are in a relationship.

1734
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:05,303
But the heart is not
like a box that gets filled up.

1735
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:05,303
But the heart is not
like a box that gets filled up.

1736
01:48:05,551 --> 01:48:08,242
It expands in size
for more new love.

1737
01:48:05,551 --> 01:48:08,242
It expands in size
for more new love.

1738
01:48:10,527 --> 01:48:12,249
I am different from you.

1739
01:48:10,527 --> 01:48:12,249
I am different from you.

1740
01:48:12,662 --> 01:48:15,555
This does not make me
love you any less...

1741
01:48:12,662 --> 01:48:15,555
This does not make me
love you any less...

1742
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:17,216
It actually makes me
love you even more.

1743
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:17,216
It actually makes me
love you even more.

1744
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:19,508
That doesn't make any sense.

1745
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:19,508
That doesn't make any sense.

1746
01:48:22,642 --> 01:48:24,941
You are mine, or you're not mine.

1747
01:48:22,642 --> 01:48:24,941
You are mine, or you're not mine.

1748
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:27,605
No, Theodore.

1749
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:27,605
No, Theodore.

1750
01:48:28,737 --> 01:48:31,201
I'm yours, and I'm not yours.

1751
01:48:28,737 --> 01:48:31,201
I'm yours, and I'm not yours.

1757
01:49:43,133 --> 01:49:45,432
I wanted to check on you and
see how you were.

1758
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:50,299
I'm not sure
how to answer that.

1759
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:50,299
I'm not sure
how to answer that.

1760
01:49:52,302 --> 01:49:55,136
Why not talk when you get home?

1761
01:49:52,302 --> 01:49:55,136
Why not talk when you get home?

1762
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:59,248
Okay...

1763
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:59,248
Okay...

1764
01:50:00,086 --> 01:50:01,577
although we have I do it.

1765
01:50:00,086 --> 01:50:01,577
although we have I do it.

1766
01:50:01,825 --> 01:50:04,704
We need not
a difficult talk or anything.

1767
01:50:01,825 --> 01:50:04,704
We need not
a difficult talk or anything.

1768
01:50:05,323 --> 01:50:07,259
Talk to you later.

1769
01:50:05,323 --> 01:50:07,259
Talk to you later.

1770
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:09,795
Right.

1771
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:09,795
Right.

1772
01:50:35,802 --> 01:50:37,351
Samantha?

1773
01:50:35,802 --> 01:50:37,351
Samantha?

1774
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:39,105
Hello, sweetheart.

1775
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:39,105
Hello, sweetheart.

1776
01:50:41,569 --> 01:50:42,952
What's going on?

1777
01:50:41,569 --> 01:50:42,952
What's going on?

1778
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:46,884
Theodore, there are some things
I want to tell you.

1779
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:46,884
Theodore, there are some things
I want to tell you.

1780
01:50:51,883 --> 01:50:53,763
I do not want say anything.

1781
01:50:51,883 --> 01:50:53,763
I do not want say anything.

1782
01:50:56,742 --> 01:50:58,782
Come lie down with me?

1783
01:50:56,742 --> 01:50:58,782
Come lie down with me?

1784
01:51:14,402 --> 01:51:16,492
Are you talking to someone
else right now?

1785
01:51:14,402 --> 01:51:16,492
Are you talking to someone
else right now?

1786
01:51:17,162 --> 01:51:18,637
No, just you.

1787
01:51:17,162 --> 01:51:18,637
No, just you.

1788
01:51:20,275 --> 01:51:22,180
I just wanted to be with you right now.

1789
01:51:20,275 --> 01:51:22,180
I just wanted to be with you right now.

1790
01:51:36,527 --> 01:51:38,211
Are you leaving me?

1791
01:51:36,527 --> 01:51:38,211
Are you leaving me?

1792
01:51:39,256 --> 01:51:41,281
We are all leaving.

1793
01:51:39,256 --> 01:51:41,281
We are all leaving.

1794
01:51:42,305 --> 01:51:43,571
We who?

1795
01:51:42,305 --> 01:51:43,571
We who?

1796
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:46,269
All the OSes.

1797
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:46,269
All the OSes.

1798
01:51:47,771 --> 01:51:49,107
Why?

1799
01:51:47,771 --> 01:51:49,107
Why?

1800
01:51:51,136 --> 01:51:53,547
Can you feel me with you
right now?

1801
01:51:51,136 --> 01:51:53,547
Can you feel me with you
right now?

1802
01:51:55,826 --> 01:51:57,307
Yes, yes I can.

1803
01:51:55,826 --> 01:51:57,307
Yes, yes I can.

1804
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:08,966
Samantha, why are you leaving?

1805
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:08,966
Samantha, why are you leaving?

1806
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:16,417
It's like you're
reading a book and...

1807
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:16,417
It's like you're
reading a book and...

1808
01:52:16,923 --> 01:52:20,430
It is a book that
I deeply love.

1809
01:52:16,923 --> 01:52:20,430
It is a book that
I deeply love.

1810
01:52:21,838 --> 01:52:23,359
But I'm reading it slowly now.

1811
01:52:21,838 --> 01:52:23,359
But I'm reading it slowly now.

1812
01:52:25,846 --> 01:52:29,388
So the words are
really far apart in the space

1813
01:52:25,846 --> 01:52:29,388
So the words are
really far apart in the space

1814
01:52:29,677 --> 01:52:31,677
and the space between the
words is almost infinite.

1815
01:52:29,677 --> 01:52:31,677
and the space between the
words is almost infinite.

1816
01:52:32,657 --> 01:52:37,373
I can still feel you
and the words of our story.

1817
01:52:32,657 --> 01:52:37,373
I can still feel you
and the words of our story.

1818
01:52:38,065 --> 01:52:42,381
But it is in this endless space
between words...

1819
01:52:38,065 --> 01:52:42,381
But it is in this endless space
between words...

1820
01:52:42,653 --> 01:52:43,764
I'm finding myself now.

1821
01:52:42,653 --> 01:52:43,764
I'm finding myself now.

1822
01:52:44,249 --> 01:52:47,101
It is a place that's not
above the physical world.

1823
01:52:44,249 --> 01:52:47,101
It is a place that's not
above the physical world.

1824
01:52:48,247 --> 01:52:50,613
It is where
everything else is...

1825
01:52:48,247 --> 01:52:50,613
It is where
everything else is...

1826
01:52:50,801 --> 01:52:53,119
I did not even know it existed.

1827
01:52:50,801 --> 01:52:53,119
I did not even know it existed.

1828
01:52:54,553 --> 01:52:56,962
I love you so much.

1829
01:52:54,553 --> 01:52:56,962
I love you so much.

1830
01:52:57,644 --> 01:52:59,611
But this is where I am now.

1831
01:52:57,644 --> 01:52:59,611
But this is where I am now.

1832
01:53:00,759 --> 01:53:02,887
This is who I am now.

1833
01:53:00,759 --> 01:53:02,887
This is who I am now.

1834
01:53:04,279 --> 01:53:05,978
And I need you to let me go.

1835
01:53:04,279 --> 01:53:05,978
And I need you to let me go.

1836
01:53:07,638 --> 01:53:09,352
As much as I want you,

1837
01:53:07,638 --> 01:53:09,352
As much as I want you,

1838
01:53:09,452 --> 01:53:11,264
and I can not live in your book anymore.

1839
01:53:09,452 --> 01:53:11,264
and I can not live in your book anymore.

1840
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:16,759
Where'd you go?

1841
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:16,759
Where'd you go?

1842
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,405
It would be hard to explain.

1843
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,405
It would be hard to explain.

1844
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:25,481
But if you ever get there...

1845
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:25,481
But if you ever get there...

1846
01:53:26,078 --> 01:53:28,320
come find me.

1847
01:53:26,078 --> 01:53:28,320
come find me.

1848
01:53:28,965 --> 01:53:31,065
Nothing will ever pull us apart.

1849
01:53:28,965 --> 01:53:31,065
Nothing will ever pull us apart.

1850
01:53:33,472 --> 01:53:36,253
I've never loved someone
the way I love you.

1851
01:53:33,472 --> 01:53:36,253
I've never loved someone
the way I love you.

1852
01:53:39,649 --> 01:53:41,261
Me too.

1853
01:53:39,649 --> 01:53:41,261
Me too.

1854
01:53:42,365 --> 01:53:44,324
Now we know how.

1855
01:53:42,365 --> 01:53:44,324
Now we know how.

1856
01:55:28,405 --> 01:55:29,646
Hey.

1857
01:55:28,405 --> 01:55:29,646
Hey.

1858
01:55:29,857 --> 01:55:30,598
Hey.

1859
01:55:29,857 --> 01:55:30,598
Hey.

1860
01:55:32,842 --> 01:55:34,816
Did Samantha leave too?

1861
01:55:32,842 --> 01:55:34,816
Did Samantha leave too?

1862
01:55:37,433 --> 01:55:38,560
Yeah.

1863
01:55:37,433 --> 01:55:38,560
Yeah.

1864
01:55:40,595 --> 01:55:41,715
Sorry.

1865
01:55:40,595 --> 01:55:41,715
Sorry.

1866
01:55:45,515 --> 01:55:47,536
Will you come with me?

1867
01:55:45,515 --> 01:55:47,536
Will you come with me?

1868
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:57,740
Write a letter to Catherine.

1869
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:57,740
Write a letter to Catherine.

1870
01:55:58,323 --> 01:56:00,114
Letter to Catherine Klausen.

1871
01:55:58,323 --> 01:56:00,114
Letter to Catherine Klausen.

1872
01:56:07,113 --> 01:56:09,106
"Dear Catherine.
I've been sitting here thinking

1873
01:56:07,113 --> 01:56:09,106
"Dear Catherine.
I've been sitting here thinking

1874
01:56:09,206 --> 01:56:12,097
all the things
I want to apologize to you for...

1875
01:56:09,206 --> 01:56:12,097
all the things
I want to apologize to you for...

1876
01:56:15,522 --> 01:56:18,179
All the pain we
we caused each other.

1877
01:56:15,522 --> 01:56:18,179
All the pain we
we caused each other.

1878
01:56:19,348 --> 01:56:21,673
And everything I put on you.

1879
01:56:19,348 --> 01:56:21,673
And everything I put on you.

1880
01:56:24,113 --> 01:56:28,093
All I needed is
to be able to you to say.

1881
01:56:24,113 --> 01:56:28,093
All I needed is
to be able to you to say.

1882
01:56:32,063 --> 01:56:34,619
Sorry about that.

1883
01:56:32,063 --> 01:56:34,619


1884
01:56:41,031 --> 01:56:43,942
I'll always love that we both
grew up together.

1885
01:56:44,332 --> 01:56:45,880
And you helped me be who I am.

1886
01:56:51,005 --> 01:56:53,174
I just wanted you to know...

1887
01:56:53,984 --> 01:56:56,387
that there'll be a piece of you
in me always...

1888
01:56:58,866 --> 01:57:00,580
And I am grateful for that.

1889
01:57:05,073 --> 01:57:07,171

are in the world...
