1
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,451
Fu-seng, finish him off

2
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:21,226
Give it to me

3
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:29,902
Where is my sister?

4
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,132
Shoot if you dare

5
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,640
Hold me up

6
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,241
Take your hands off me

7
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,185
Watch that side for me

8
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:21,353
And what will you do?

9
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:26,125
You're removing your vest?

10
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:28,460
Hold it

11
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,270
It's full of dynamite

12
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:32,131
Dynamite? The evil bastard

13
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,232
I cannot get shot

14
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,266
Neither can I

15
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:37,970
Hurry

16
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,571
Get in

17
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:43,475
I told you I shouldn't have brought you

18
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:47,413
So clumsy

19
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,425
You're clumsy

20
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,448
See what we can use

21
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:51,583
The gun is empty

22
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:54,653
Catch

23
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:58,297
Freeze, or I'll shoot

24
00:02:58,335 --> 00:02:58,926
What did he say?

25
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,596
I don't know
I don't think they will dare to shoot

26
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,660
I'll count to three

27
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:02,637
Pretend to throw a hand grenade

28
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:03,401
One, two, three

29
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:04,430
What?

30
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,771
Didn't you hear me say "pretend"?

31
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:11,574
Speak clearly next time

32
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,717
Come out, Chaibat

33
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:00,596
What's the occasion, General?

34
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,657
Chaibat, you dare come to my place
and wreak havoc!

35
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:05,396
You make me lose face

36
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,729
And vice versa

37
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:11,764
What happened just now
You never even tried to help me

38
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,606
How can you blame me? How can I
explain to them?

39
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,707
You don't have to explain to anyone

40
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,011
I'll take over your goods from now on

41
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:24,816
I'll repay your losses this time

42
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:27,749
You think a repayment will be enough?

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,055
I can't help it if you refuse

44
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:34,387
But I know you are clever

45
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:37,164
And of course I came prepared

46
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:41,361
If your eyes are still good
look around you

47
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,411
God, I also don't want to go too far

48
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:56,746
But as for taking all my goods

49
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:58,754
That is not my decision

50
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:01,220
Do you want to see Mr. Ginsha?

51
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,659
If you will make the introduction
I wouldn't mind the trip

52
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,022
Good; get the helicopter ready

53
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:08,287
Yes, sir

54
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,926
Are you all right?

55
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:16,495
Chaibat

56
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,937
You had my sister wear a dynamite-
stuffed vest so she can be your shield?

57
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:22,605
What if she got shot?

58
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:24,102
Don't move

59
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:29,345
No one dares speak to me
in that tone

60
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:35,047
Hua-nui

61
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,181
You bastard

62
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:39,184
Hua-nui

63
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,638
See? This is bullet-proof

64
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:51,064
I would not treat my team like that

65
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,873
These two are cute

66
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:59,508
Chaibat, you are great; this way

67
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:05,984
Take them to Malaysia to wait for me

68
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,351
Have fun!

69
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:19,267
The scum; we'll get him sooner or later

70
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:37,051
Miss Ching, Mr. Chaibat says hello

71
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:38,787
You came to tell me this?

72
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,422
No matter what the verdict is
w can still appeal

73
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,383
I know local law well

74
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:47,690
There must be a reason for his confidence

75
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:49,356
Talk is cheap

76
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,261
Yes, he wants to ask you...

77
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:55,037
where the Swiss bank code is

78
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,499
I'll tell him when I see him

79
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,695
Get your bearings

80
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,728
Let me take a picture of you two
How about right here?

81
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:28,736
Smile

82
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:32,831
Let's look over there

83
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,511
Fu-seng, this side is important

84
00:07:58,268 --> 00:07:59,792
Gather around

85
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:07,841
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Merdeka
Square; and now behind us we have...

86
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:14,078
Familiarize yourself with this street

87
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:20,823
Let's go over there

88
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:29,825
Serious offenders go through here

89
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:31,890
Take a good look

90
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,266
Pao, can you tell us what
we will be doing?

91
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,968
I'll tell you when the time comes

92
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,374
Let's look at the intersection

93
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:55,719
Do you want to go for a swim?

94
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:05,993
Do you think Chaibat wants a jailbreak?

95
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,159
It's possible

96
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:08,171
I wonder when

97
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:10,196
You heard him, he'll tell us...
when the time comes

98
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:14,966
Let's go swimming together

99
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,649
Let's take a picture together

100
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,080
Come, let's take another one

101
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:23,475
Stand still

102
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:38,623
Sorry

103
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,235
The pictures are ready

104
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,477
We don't know anything
and we've lost contact with Hong Kong

105
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:50,741
What are we doing here?

106
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,006
Look

107
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:56,441
At what?

108
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,352
My brain, it's thinking the same thing

109
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,053
Look, she's cute

110
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:04,316
Very exciting

111
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:05,750
Let's go over to see

112
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:14,966
What's happening?

113
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,966
May, what's wrong?

114
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,232
Nothing

115
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,569
Would you like a drink?

116
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,012
What's going on?

117
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,046
My girlfriend is here

118
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:42,521
Where is she now?

119
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:44,723
She's coming over

120
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:46,958
Give me a massage

121
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:16,361
Ka-kui, Chan Ka-kui

122
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:20,667
Chan Ka-kui

123
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,770
Yes, Miss?

124
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,435
I'm just picking up my pictures

125
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,137
Fu-seng

126
00:11:32,716 --> 00:11:33,705
What are you doing?

127
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:34,806
Headache

128
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,381
Your brother must be pent up

129
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,250
After we finish this job...

130
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,288
I'll take him to enjoy himself

131
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,017
Great!

132
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:47,523
Excellent

133
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,492
I feel much better now

134
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:52,891
Have you ordered yet?

135
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:54,492
We don't know what to order

136
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:55,929
Because we don't know English

137
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:57,733
I'll order; what do you want?

138
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,364
Paris Water

139
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:00,532
What?

140
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,100
Do you want one?

141
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:03,301
I'll have Paris Water as well

142
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:07,048
I'll teach you later

143
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,723
Hua-nui, I'll teach you, come

144
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,366
Be brave, tell the waiter:

145
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,229
"Two Perriers", okay?

146
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:36,912
It's all right, go ahead

147
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:48,013
Chan Ka-kui

148
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,818
Chan ka-kui

149
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,130
Miss, are you talking to me?

150
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,903
May, listen to me

151
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,577
No; don't explain anything

152
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,509
Do you have the number for the
chemical materials truck?

153
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,077
What's Fu-seng doing? Flirting?

154
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,080
I left it in the room
I'll get it later

155
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:22,380
I'll go see what's going on

156
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:23,782
Hurry, I'll wait in the lobby

157
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:26,053
I'm really working on a case

158
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:28,123
If people know my identity
I will die

159
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:32,162
If I were here on vacation
I'd be swimming now

160
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,358
Thank you

161
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:36,628
I can't talk too much

162
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:37,896
Where is your room?

163
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,702
I'll call you later

164
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,599
Why are you still here?

165
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:42,236
What's going on?

166
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,211
Brother said he's not interested

167
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:44,406
She wants my business

168
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:45,637
I said "no", get away

169
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:46,580
Don't touch me

170
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,412
Go!

171
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,577
Get away!

172
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,242
Don't make faces at me!

173
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,880
I'm just talking to my boyfriend,
stay out!

174
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,646
Not bad

175
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,281
But my sister doesn't like it

176
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,549
How much?

177
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:58,719
I guess not too expensive

178
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:00,587
Who is your boyfriend?

179
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:08,493
Leave her, let's find a better one

180
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,297
She's fine, a shame to waste

181
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:13,631
What the hell are you doing to May?

182
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:16,973
Miss, if he won't have you, I will

183
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:18,670
How much do you charge?

184
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,081
Only your mother would charge

185
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:23,044
Drink water

186
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:25,446
What are you doing? May!

187
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,047
Let's go

188
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,318
Are you okay?

189
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,762
Yes

190
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,489
Let's go

191
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,939
Give me your key

192
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:55,747
Why?

193
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,447
I left mine by the pool
Go get it for me

194
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,553
Hurry back, don't run off

195
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:07,852
What's happening. Miss?

196
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,196
I want to cry

197
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,265
Miss, you cannot solicit
customers here

198
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:13,458
Your mother solicits

199
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:14,595
We are staying here

200
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:16,563
How can I help you?

201
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,834
Kill the people who pushed me
into the pool

202
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:22,872
What did he say?

203
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:25,910
He said we're so beautiful

204
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,039
She is a hooker

205
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:37,115
May, please let me explain

206
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,991
I can't talk about it

207
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,319
Fine

208
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:47,992
May

209
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:48,766
Let go of my hand

210
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:49,794
I know you've been offended

211
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:50,862
You do?

212
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:52,301
The whole hotel...

213
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,104
thinks I'm a prostitute

214
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,132
What do you want me to do?

215
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:00,271
Come here

216
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:02,844
You should know now what I'm doing

217
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:04,943
Please smile

218
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:06,285
Call Uncle Bill when you get back...

219
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,548
Go to hell, you bastard!

220
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,389
May

221
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,021
Let go, I said I don't want your business

222
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:15,389
I'd rather have the gentleman behind you
than do business with you

223
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,588
Look in the mirror

224
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,463
I'm not having anyone as ugly as you

225
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,703
A pretty hooker is a sign of trouble

226
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:29,968
Let's go

227
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,070
What's going on?

228
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,346
Nothing, I'll tell you later

229
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:35,473
Let's go, hurry up

230
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:39,477
What is it?

231
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:40,921
Same thing

232
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,455
First things first; can you drive a truck?

233
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:46,184
Yes

234
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:48,720
Excellent

235
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:50,265
Why don't you call from the room?

236
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,227
A public phone is better

237
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,531
I told you to get my key

238
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:58,769
I forgot; I'll go get it now

239
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:00,531
See you in the room

240
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,639
What's going on?

241
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,276
I'm not too sure

242
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,554
That was my boyfriend

243
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:13,811
Really?

244
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:16,754
He's an undercover police; I think he's...

245
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,949
on a case, but I'm not sure

246
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,018
He didn't tell you?

247
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,329
No, because it's too dangerous

248
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,796
But I just did something which he would...

249
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,560
never dream I would be so clever

250
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,759
Like what?

251
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,332
I don't want to talk about it

252
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,475
Get some good rest

253
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,237
Bye, May, I'll see you tomorrow

254
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:36,706
Okay; oh, don't be late

255
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,969
Okay

256
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,013
Hua-nui, where is Pao?

257
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,280
Telephone, Pao

258
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:59,568
No matter what you hear, act as though
nothing is happening

259
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,264
Our two assistant now

260
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:03,438
He is Chan Ka-kui of the
Royal Hong Kong Police

261
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:05,302
I have his girlfriend

262
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,066
You decide what we should do

263
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,837
All right, we'll push it back one day

264
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:13,539
Don't worry, we're delaying by one day

265
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,351
Give me your guns

266
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:37,899
Case 2370192 Ching Wing-xi
with regard to the charge, I am satisfied...

267
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:42,104
that the evidence produced
by the prosecution...

268
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,546
has not be rebutted by the defence

269
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:50,315
The accused does not cast any unreasonable
doubt on the prosecution's case

270
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:52,645
Under the circumstances,
I find the accused...

271
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:57,883
guilty as charged...

272
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:03,959
and convict her on the charge
and sentence her to death

273
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,066
All rise

274
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:42,360
Chan Ka-kui

275
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:43,394
Over

276
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,629
They are walking towards you

277
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,233
If you don't want your girlfriend harmed...
you better pay attention

278
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:49,667
Copy

279
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,153
Out of the way! I don't have brakes

280
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,156
Stop

281
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:18,805
No brakes

282
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,981
Back up, everyone

283
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:40,922
Where did you learn how to drive?

284
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,129
Poison gas inside the car! Go away!

285
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:50,839
What did he say? I don't know

286
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:51,996
Let me go

287
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,445
The chemicals are toxic;
you'll die if you inhale them

288
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:01,806
Get out of here now!

289
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:05,786
Hurry, disperse the crowd

290
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,316
Let me go

291
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:19,729
Hurry up

292
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,129
Go

293
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,731
What are you doing?

294
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:29,133
Go

295
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,746
Get in, hurry

296
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,651
I won't let her go until I see May

297
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,949
Get in first

298
00:21:44,994 --> 00:21:46,188
No deal

299
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:49,392
Ka-kui, save me

300
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,588
Let my wife go now

301
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:51,956
Ka-kui

302
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,434
Let May go, or I'll shoot her

303
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:56,765
Ka-kui

304
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,374
I'm scared

305
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:03,842
Let her go or none of us can go

306
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,912
Ka-kui

307
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:10,908
May

308
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:12,418
In the car, hurry

309
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:14,245
May, are you all right?

310
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,279
Boss, the police are here

311
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,790
Let's go, hurry

312
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:27,191
Get her an ambulance

313
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:41,376
Stop, give me back my car

314
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:38,337
Come down, hurry

315
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,530
Pao, crash into him

316
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:45,742
Hua-nui, get down

317
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,876
Over there

318
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,251
Someone's on the roof

319
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:59,191
She's up there, coming over here

320
00:23:59,996 --> 00:24:00,985
Up there

321
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,017
Are you all right?

322
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:57,049
Chase him, hurry

323
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,298
Out of the way!

324
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:19,630
This way

325
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:28,606
This way

326
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:54,131
We'll go that way

327
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:57,774
Back off, remove her handcuffs

328
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:00,604
Well?

329
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,639
Give me the gun

330
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,076
Boss is coming, hurry

331
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,096
They're over there

332
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,897
Over there

333
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:39,186
Wait there, Boss is coming

334
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:44,415
They're over there

335
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,391
Hurry, fly over

336
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:47,418
What are you doing?

337
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,124
I dropped my gun

338
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:50,554
Pretend you have one

339
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:52,323
Pretend?

340
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:57,995
They don't have guns

341
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,132
Run!

342
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't move

343
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:12,643
Back off, or I'll shoot

344
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:17,615
Beat him up

345
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,916
You'll die for sure

346
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:19,950
Great timing!

347
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:24,262
Come down, save me

348
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,422
Okay

349
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:29,793
Climb up

350
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:57,555
Are you all right?

351
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,794
Leave me; chase them

352
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,131
Let's go

353
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,337
Kill him

354
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:09,426
Fly over there

355
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,191
Land on the train

356
00:29:33,596 --> 00:29:34,585
Got it

357
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:17,027
Save him

358
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:20,072
Hurry, save me

359
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:22,232
Fly lower to get Boss

360
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,125
Kwong, get down here

361
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:49,727
Boss, are you all right?

362
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:51,569
I'm fine, kill him

363
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,549
Hang on

364
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:47,251
Take off

365
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,202
How are you?

366
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,303
Get him!

367
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,762
Help

368
00:33:36,272 --> 00:33:39,332
Help

369
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:57,119
Get in

370
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,077
Come up

371
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:32,384
3386776, code 1270WKU

372
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:35,557
That is my Swiss bank account code

373
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,423
Anyone can get the money

374
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:40,457
I'd love to get the money...

375
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:42,400
but it belongs to the
Hong Kong government

376
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,765
No, it belongs to all China's people

377
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,407
Let our Hong Kong Government hold it

378
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:51,578
After 1997, we will also be China's
people, and it will be yours, too

379
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:53,904
No way
