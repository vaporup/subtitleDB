1
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,325
Nowadays, drug traffickers use every...

2
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,098
conceivable method to ship drugs

3
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,695
They put the drugs into condoms...

4
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,635
then into the stomach, anus, even corpses

5
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,743
Including babies' corpses

6
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,536
Last year alone, there were over...

7
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,614
150 deaths by poison when...

8
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,674
broken condoms leak drugs into the...

9
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,618
internal organs

10
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,922
But drug traffickers who die this way...

11
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,412
are in the minority

12
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:35,150
Most pass through customs successfully

13
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,517
Fighting narcotics has always

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,824
been a very important mission to us...

15
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:38,986
at the Royal Hong Kong Police

16
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:40,961
We know this data well

17
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,428
Can you get to the point?

18
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,899
Most of the drugs coming through...
South-east Asia come from...

19
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,635
a drug lord named Chaibat

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,265
If we arrest him, the drugs on the...

21
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,208
market would be reduced by half

22
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,211
In what aspect can the Royal
Hong Kong Police help you?

23
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,283
What we need is a super cop

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,948
Well, let me think about it
I'll let you know tomorrow

25
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,688
Fix it for me, tell me tomorrow

26
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:13,921
Yes, sir

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,170
That's a senior officer for you...

28
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,397
delegate, then disappear

29
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:21,762
How true

30
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,364
Fix it for me

31
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,368
I knew it

32
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,711
Call Ka-kui for me

33
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,973
Yes, sir

34
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,312
Thank you

35
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,877
Yes, sir

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,999
Good morning, sir Morning

37
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,776
They're in a meeting

38
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,980
You can't ask Ka-kui to do this

39
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,750
Why not? Is he irresponsible?

40
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,616
He's very responsible

41
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,921
Does he disobey his seniors?

42
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,495
Whoever he disobeys must be bad

43
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,197
All you do is talk; you complain that...
I don't give him a promotion...

44
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,025
Here's a chance, but you stop me

45
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,561
You call this a chance?

46
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,305
A China labour camp is no joke!

47
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,496
Are you afraid he can't handle it?

48
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,970
If he can't, then no one can

49
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,776
I know; asking him to walk the beat...

50
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,170
is a waste of his talent, I know that

51
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,274
Now Interpol needs a super cop

52
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,447
Ka-kui is a super cop

53
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,640
But you won't let him do it

54
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,187
I know, but it's very dangerous

55
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,985
He's been with me for so long

56
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,420
How can I ask him to risk his life?

57
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,449
If you can't ask him, then I'll go back...

58
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,323
to Interpol and tell them...

59
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,586
no one in the Royal Hong Kong Police...

60
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,425
can so this, okay?

61
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,655
They should ask James Bond

62
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,625
Correct

63
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,035
Hello, sir

64
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,313
Uncle Bill

65
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,256
Come in, Ka-kui

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,419
I need you

67
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,521
Please, sit

68
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,756
What's so urgent?

69
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,367
I found you a great position

70
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,138
Duty desk at Sha Tau Kok precinct
Just sign here

71
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,242
Uncle Bill, let me do it

72
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,701
Isn't that what I'm doing?

73
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,812
Sha Tau Kok is great,
all that fresh air...

74
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,482
no need to walk the beat

75
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,345
I meant the Interpol job

76
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:48,876
You heard?

77
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,077
Let me do it

78
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,284
It's very dangerous

79
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,990
Uncle Bill, it be more dangerous...
to do a job every day...

80
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,084
that you feel nothing for...

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,893
and wait for the end of your shift

82
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,127
Do you need to discuss it with May?

83
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,666
No, I've already decided

84
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,096
Go home and pack

85
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,232
Yes, sir

86
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:13,934
Ka-kui

87
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,202
Yes?

88
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,579
Chief will be very happy

89
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,939
Aren't you happy?

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,946
I'd be happy if Chief will do this job

91
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,820
Are we too devious?

92
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,894
Yes, but you more so than I

93
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,192
Why?

94
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,229
You're my senior officer

95
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,109
Why do you have to go to camp?

96
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,477
You're not allowed to make phone calls

97
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,848
It's a special training camp
After this training, I may get a raise

98
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,140
You're not happy?

99
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,417
No, I hate it when you have those
special missions

100
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:00,718
Camp is best; it's safest
You won't be risking your life

101
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,695
This is my life insurance policy

102
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,159
This is my bank passbook

103
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,889
Why are you giving them to me?

104
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,699
You're the beneficiary; come

105
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,969
What's wrong?

106
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,981
My safety deposit box key
I have some foreign currency in there

107
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,379
Why are you giving me these things?

108
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,850
Aren't you coming back soon?

109
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,846
I'm worried it might take longer

110
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,788
Don't forget to pay my insurance fee...

111
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,757
and extend my banking services

112
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,520
What are you doing?

113
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,688
I'll be gone a whole month!

114
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,231
You'll be late

115
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,129
I won't get shot for it

116
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,078
Remember, no dating boys

117
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,681
No dating boys for you

118
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,245
May

119
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,084
Uncle Bill

120
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,596
One month will be over soon
I'll watch him for you

121
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,887
I must go, bye

122
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,921
Bye!

123
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,630
Goodbye, Uncle Bill

124
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,174
Your ID and air ticket to Guangzhou

125
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,532
Yes, sir

126
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,370
Be careful

127
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,935
Don't worry

128
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,638
China's Public Security Department
will give its full support

129
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,181
Then I'd worry more

130
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,785
Uncle Bill, say something nice

131
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,014
The best thing to say is "Good luck"

132
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,055
With this mission...

133
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:43,625
the Royal Hong Kong Police...
releases Ka-kui like a kite

134
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,831
The thread may break in the wind

135
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,126
Don't make these dangerous metaphors

136
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,391
Don't worry

137
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,370
If the thread breaks, I'll fly back

138
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,600
I told you he's smart

139
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,597
Good luck

140
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,965
Thank you, sir

141
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,705
Uncle Bill, I must go

142
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,113
Then, really "good luck"

143
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,408
Yes, sir Ka-kui

144
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,009
Stop nagging, will you?

145
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,118
In an emergency, call this number

146
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,256
Remember this number
Tear up the paper afterwards

147
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,551
I remember it

148
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,222
I'm going

149
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,253
I'll tear it up for you

150
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,621
I'm going

151
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,290
Thank you

152
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,527
I'm making phone calls, don't disturb me

153
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,201
My phone number again

154
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,677
Great, I'll let the world know

155
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,237
Come in, please

156
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,086
Please sit

157
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,240
You're the super cop sent by Hong Kong?

158
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,078
The file from Hong Kong says:

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,847
Chan ka-kui parenthesis super cop

160
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,826
Super cops in Hong Kong...

161
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,965
are like goods in a supermarket:

162
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,221
Plentiful, and cheap

163
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,962
This young man is modest

164
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,499
We are one big family

165
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,429
We will do our best to assist you

166
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,563
Thank you all

167
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,839
Because your mission is very dangerous,

168
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,072
and we feel you do not understand
the situation inside China...

169
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,576
we have arranged for some lessons

170
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,073
To learn what?

171
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,082
Superintendent Yang from Interpol
will make arrangements for you

172
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,254
This is Superintendent Yang

173
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,724
How are you, Superintendent Yang?

174
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,829
Study hard

175
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,960
Yes, sir

176
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,795
You two talk together

177
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,165
Yes, Party Secretary

178
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,109
I didn't think Superintendent Yang...
would be such a pretty girl

179
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,754
You may speak Cantonese with me

180
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,420
Great, I feel much better

181
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,293
We start now Sure

182
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,858
From now on, you're Lin Fu-seng

183
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,089
Age 32, a buyer for the...

184
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,998
Foshan Fifth National Machine Factory

185
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,227
Are you clear?

186
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,204
Yes

187
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,367
Your uniform is very stylish

188
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,831
Can civilians wear it, too?

189
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,641
You were with the Foshan Martial Art Team,

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,316

00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,448
with your mother and younger sister

192
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,720
Your father passed away in 1978

193
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,649
Poor thing, his father died so young

194
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,879
Are you clear?

195
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,913
Yes

196
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,222
Then repeat it for me

197
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,132
I'm Lin Fu-seng, age 32...

198
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:48,204

00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,478
I live at 17 something village?

204
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,877
Juanyao Village

205
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,221
That's a tongue-twister

206
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,448
And they call you super cop
You have no memory

207
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,659
Lady, it's my first try

208
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,624
Let's see you try it
I just tell you once:

209
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:11,952
I am Chan Ka-kui

210
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,895
Born on April 7, 1958...

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,327
Joined the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1981

216
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm not clever

217
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,805
I just studied your data

218
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,548
You do the same, learn it well

219
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,275
Let's get your pictures taken

220
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,412
Take pictures?

221
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,489
I hear the Pearl River Bridge
is really beautiful

222
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,718
Now what?

223
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,590
Your hand here

224
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,965
Smile, look ahead

225
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,635
Now what?

226
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,152
Wushu Team, not opera troupe

227
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,712
Re-do the makeup

228
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,550
You could have said so sooner

229
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,621
Your turn

230
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,300
Spread your legs more

231
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,941
Look ahead, he's ready

232
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,094
Film is "Plastic Roll,
Walkman is Ready Music"

233
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,727
Soda can is...

234
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,988
"Easy-pull can"

235
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,804
Police is "No. 2", militia is "No. 1"

236
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,630
Gun is "Fire Cannon"

237
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,772
Are they all your subordinates?

238
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,014
Grandpa's

239
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,018
What does that mean?

240
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,384
The country's; but under my command

241
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,716
Chan Ka-kui Yes?

242
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,226
You're dead! You're Lin Fu-seng

243
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,726
You trapped me; you're evil

244
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,857
The men you'll be dealing with are worse

245
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,020
So I want you to be very careful

246
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,462
When do we leave?

247
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,366
According to reliable sources,

248
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,769
Chaibat has bribed mercenaries...

249
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,776
to spring Pao from the labour camp

250
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,141
We're just waiting for the right time

251
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,976
Those pictures will suffice?

252
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,983
The powers of modern technology

253
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,120
I know, but I don't know Wushu

254
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,949
Your file says you're a wrestling champion

255
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,653
That's just street-fighting

256
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,488
At the academy, we learned karate,
Taekwondo,

257
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,557
Boxing; Chinese kung-fu...

258
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,626
was not a part of it

259
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,125
This is "Hard Qigung"?

260
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,723
You didn't learn this?

261
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,259
Of course not; you're just standing
and getting hit; how stupid

262
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,026
Superintendent Yang

263
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,834
Comrade Wang; let me introduce...

264
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,539
our Head Coach of the Militia

265
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,739
The super cop from Hong Kong

266
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,609
"Super"? The you must be great

267
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,037
She's too kind

268
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,271
Not at all

269
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,717
He is 7th degree Taekwondo,
8th degree Hopkido...

270
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,817
9th degree Karate, 10th degree Judo...

271
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,589
and twice South-east Asian Wresting
champion, isn't that right?

272
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,218
What can I say?

273
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,253
Then I must learn from you

274
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,417
Of course

275
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,258
Stop training

276
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,457
Gather

277
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,304
Sit

278
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,642
Please

279
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,380
Must you do this to me?

280
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,356
We welcome the super cop from Hong Kong

281
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,056
Come

282
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,196
Is this some kind of a joke?

283
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,394
You'll be fine

284
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,096
Will he really hit me?

285
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,230
No

286
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,865
Stop the match if something happens

287
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,771
Of course not

288
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,211
Just for fun, right?

289
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,784
Sorry

290
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,468
You're great, I salute you
Your reputation is justified

291
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,634
Let's go again

292
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,802
Thank you

293
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,205
Please, play a little longer

294
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,709
How does this work?

295
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,955
Simple; hold here...
step on these

296
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,146
I'll push

297
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,994
How do I stop it?

298
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,814
Next time, you must say I'm
world champion in somersault

299
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,017
No more playing; our mission starts now

300
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,384
Do I look like I'm playing?

301
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,145
They have 3 vehicles, 6 men

302
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,848
Do you remember the coal mine's layout?

303
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,383
Yes

304
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,793
I may not be good at anything...
but my memory is my strong point

305
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,724
Really? I hope you remember where
the high passage is

306
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,367
Don't worry, my life depends on it

307
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,560
Tell your men not to shoot

308
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,136
Some of the guards have no bullets

309
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,770
You two, get ready below

310
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,343
My life depends on you; look out for me

311
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,338
Be careful

312
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,459
Why did you stop! Get to work!

313
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,538
Brother Pao, we go as planned

314
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,592
You hit me!

315
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,976
The prisoners are fighting

316
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,940
Freeze

317
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,271
Pao

318
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,427
Officer

319
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,029
No need

320
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:48,869
Thank you

321
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:49,896
Turn off the engine

322
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,272
This is a random check

323
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,043
Hurry

324
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,941
Go look around the back

325
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,478
Get ready to move

326
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,417
What's up there?

327
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,156
Nothing, just coal

328
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,520
Coal?

329
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,558
Officer

330
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,104
There's nothing here

331
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,176
Hua, get going!

332
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,046
Hurry, Hua

333
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,952
Quickly, Hua

334
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,543
Hua

335
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,955
Pao, get up

336
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,452
Let's go, Pao

337
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,463
Stop

338
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,222
Pao

339
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:50,924
Run

340
00:22:54,306 --> 00:23:02,577
Pao... wait, I don't know him

341
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,871
Chicken Hung!

342
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,814
Hung

343
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,614
You're crazy, let's go

344
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,353
What did Hung say he didn't know?

345
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,884
He didn't know the way

346
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:18,657
Do you?

347
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,686
Yes, up there

348
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,088
It's so high; how do you get up there?

349
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,725
Jump off

350
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,959
Go up

351
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:56,956
Run, Pao

352
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,161
Over here

353
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,032
Don't move

354
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,309
There is a high passage up there

355
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,613
Jump down, I'll turn on the switch

356
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,936
All right

357
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,377
Hurry

358
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:27,987
Turn off the switch Yes

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,989
Come with me

360
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,997
Hurry

361
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,971
Someone is after us; hurry

362
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,233
Don't shoot

363
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,341
Just chase them

364
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,748
Hurry

365
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,549
Why did it stop?

366
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:57,951
I don't know

367
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,487
What to do now?

368
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,521
I don't know

369
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,569
Get off here

370
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,872
Let's go

371
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:19,873
Freeze, don't move

372
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,916
Go

373
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,291
No way

374
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,866
This is the high passage?

375
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,730
What are you looking for?

376
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,470
To see if there is an underground passage

377
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,907
Freeze, don't move

378
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,144
There's no time, go

379
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,385
Freeze, don't move

380
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,682
Run and I'll shoot

381
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,953
Go

382
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,407
Some high passage

383
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,043
Are you all right?

384
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,578
Yes

385
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,612
Let's go

386
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,422
Over this hill...

387
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,300
you will see the road; take it into town

388
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,262
Goodbye

389
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,932
Where are you going?

390
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,212
I took $2000 from Hung...

391
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,113
just to take you here

392
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,504
I don't do anything else

393
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,514
You have good moves

394
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,241
Take me into town

395
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,117
I'll take you to Hong Kong to do
big business

396
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,357
Hong Kong is too far

397
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,918
I'll take you into town for $500

398
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,117
I don't have $500

399
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,921
When we get to Hong Kong I can
give you $50,000, not just $500

400
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,102
I don't know you
I don't blame you; trust me

401
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:23,606
All right, it's a deal
Give me $50,000 in Hong Kong

402
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,333
See? You trust me

403
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,333
Hurry, it will rain soon

404
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:30,538
How did you know Hung?

405
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,175
I follow whoever has money

406
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,910
Where are you from?

407
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,677
Foshan

408
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,043
Don't you raise pigs in your hometown?

409
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,890
Our pigs eat vegetables

410
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,823
These pigs eat feed, so they stink

411
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,533
Pao

412
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,577
He's one of us

413
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,246
Pao

414
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,216
Pao has returned; come out

415
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,653
You're back!

416
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,754
Pao

417
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,357
Bring a towel, quickly

418
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,927
You've lost weight

419
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,162
It's so good you're out,
it must have been hard

420
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,542
What so hard about it?
Labour camp is like vacation

421
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,112
Pao is a big shot wherever he goes

422
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,713
That's right

423
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:17,482
How did I get in?

424
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,479
Fishball?

425
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,913
I don't know anything

426
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,754
Shar-pei, what happened to our goods?

427
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,321
Confiscated

428
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,828
Pao, it's not my fault, it's not me

429
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,673
No, Pao, I'm sorry

430
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,004
It's my fault, I'm sorry

431
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,139
Give me one more chance

432
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,506
No, Pao

433
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,583
Give me a chance

434
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,791
This here is Fu-seng

435
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,025
He's one of us

436
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,772
Where are the goods from Yunnan?

437
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,332
They arrive in two days

438
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,139
Pao, we must get out of here

439
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,175
Aren't you from Foshan?

440
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,641
Since we have time...

441
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,414
We'll go visit your family

442
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,044
All right

443
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,658
Fishball, Shar-pei, come with me

444
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,520
We'll meet at our old place with the goods

445
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,850
Yes, Pao

446
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,819
Let's go

447
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,189
Let's go

448
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,462
Fu-seng

449
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,471
Fu-seng, Pao wants you

450
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,000
Yes?

451
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,035
Where is your home?

452
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,469
We're not there yet

453
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,207
This is Foshan

454
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,755
Yes, but we haven't arrived at my village

455
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,683
There's fork ahead, which way?

456
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,060
A fork? The we must stop

457
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,434
Where is it?

458
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,280
The police are behind us, hurry

459
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,921
Fu-seng, are the police
following us?

460
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,290
Don't worry; where do you live?

461
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,448
I live at...

462
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,686
You haven't forgotten where
you live, have you?

463
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,155
I've been gone 3 years
Everything has changed

464
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,930
You must remember something

465
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:46,467
Yes, but there are so many buildings

466
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,411
Come, Pao

467
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,514
Uncle Fu-seng

468
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,260
Grandma misses you, come home quickly

469
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,721
My nephew

470
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,898
Come home, come!

471
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,763
Third Aunt, Brother Fu-seng is back!

472
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,499
Fu-seng, you have returned!

473
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,402
Great, I'll take you to Mother

474
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:28,968
My Third Aunt

475
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,911
This way

476
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,275
Not this way, that way

477
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,542
I know, I was helping you with these

478
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,683
No need; follow us, please

479
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,815
Pao, this way

480
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,783
You haven't been back in years

481
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,585
Mother will be so happy to see you

482
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,728
You're home! I've missed you

483
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,122
Brother Fu-seng

484
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,460
You must have done well

485
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,838
Of course he has

486
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,938
See Mother first; she's missed you

487
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,669
Hurry, Fu-seng

488
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,615
Fu-seng's Mom!

489
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,406
Where is she?

490
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,814
Show your friends some hospitality

491
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,409
She may be sleeping

492
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,212
Pao, make yourself at home

493
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,713
Please sit

494
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,281
I have to go

495
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:16,582
Fu-seng, where is the washroom?

496
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,986
Outside, around the corner

497
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,289
Wherever no one can see you

498
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,461
It's the country-side; go anywhere

499
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,236
Who is that girl?

500
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,266
What girl?

501
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,462
That one

502
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,430
Which one?

503
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,000
The one in the picture of you

504
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,235
Your wife?

505
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,437
She is...

506
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,577
Elder Brother, you're home!

507
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,478
My younger sister

508
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,485
Your sister? Yes

509
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,691
When did you come back?

510
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,992
You've grown so much

511
00:33:56,401 --> 00:34:01,100
You're prettier, too, and fatter

512
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,830
Don't pinch me so hard

513
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,034
You two have a great relationship

514
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:07,772
Yes, we do

515
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,506
Greet Pao

516
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,535
Hello, Pao

517
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,410
What's your name?

518
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,244
I'm Hua-nui

519
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,271
She's Hua-nui

520
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,543
Hurry, serve Pao some tea

521
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,714
We've always liked to fight

522
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,445
Take off your jacket, it's more comfortable

523
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,147
Fu-seng

524
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,755
How mighty you are

525
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,861
You rascal, haven't been home in ages

526
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,763
You've even grown a beard!

527
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:32,992
That's fine, Granny

528
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,268
That's "Auntie" to you

529
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,304
Auntie, he is your son
Fu-seng

530
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,975
Yes, Mother, I'm home

531
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,278
You've been away so long...

532
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,482
and you're leaving again so soon

533
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,980
You have squandered the family fortune

534
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,085
Did you bring money home?

535
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,856
Look, you glow at the mention of money

536
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,553
He will, please sit

537
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,094
Please sit

538
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,193
Have some tea, Pao

539
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,357
Please have some tea

540
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,538
Let me do it It's me

541
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,528
Bill, you...

542
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,563
You brought dollar bills?

543
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,935
No

544
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,005
Did you bring money?

545
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,167
Also no

546
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,268
No money and no dollar bills?

547
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,369
He did

548
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,537
He did?

549
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,709
Granny... I mean, Auntie

550
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,474
This is a gift from Fu-seng

551
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,483
For me? What money is it?

552
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,344
Hong Kong dollars

553
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,788
They're valuable

554
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,158
Hua-nui, go buy two boiled chickens

555
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,097
Let me treat you to boiled chickens

556
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,389
The way the world is...

557
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,425
Tai

558
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,301
My sister, that's Tai and Jiang

559
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,169
Hello, Tai, Jiang

560
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,195
Let me introduce you to my Mother

561
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,604
Mother

562
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,067
They're calling you

563
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,334
Calling me?

564
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:49,902
Let me introduce...

565
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,649
No need

566
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:57,410
Where are you going? It's dinner time

567
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,146
I'm taking Fu-seng to dinner in town

568
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,654
Rascal, leaving before dinner

569
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,450
I'm taking Fu-seng to make a fortune

570
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:09,058
Take Hua-nui with you

571
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,592
Great! I'll go change

572
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:12,725
Take Hua-nui?

573
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,861
Take me with you

574
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,670
Eat here first, we'll be back soon

575
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,264
It's boiled chicken!

576
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,810
Goodbye, Mother

577
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,196
This place is famous for wild game

578
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,831
Whether it's endangered or extinct...

579
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,465
you can eat it here

580
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,245
Hua-nui, eat what you like

581
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:00,973
All right

582
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,347
Pao, they're here

583
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,524
It's so cruel; your police don't care?

584
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,594
Here's Pao

585
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,129
Pao

586
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,341
Sit; Hua-nui sit here

587
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,438
Have some tea, Pao

588
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,040
They are...

589
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,754
My team, Fu-seng, Hua-nui

590
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,792
Sit over there

591
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,799
Go

592
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:05,704
Don't look

593
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,079
I think I see Bear

594
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,145
Thanks

595
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,354
Those guys at the entrance are police

596
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,284
Are they yours?

597
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,056
Of course not

598
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,567
He looks like the criminal who escaped
from labour camp

599
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,866
Pao cannot be taken by the police

600
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,094
I know

601
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,473
This is your turf, you find a way

602
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,033
All right

603
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,213
Simple, I'll find out

604
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,604
You two watch them

605
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,809
I'll get backup

606
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:44,877
What will you have?

607
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,555
Civet braised with Turtle testicles

608
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,517
What did you order?

609
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,653
Civet braised with Turtle testicles

610
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,521
Get me one, too

611
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,726
Get one more

612
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,663
This is Sergeant Chan Xiang-dong
calling dispatch

613
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,434
Please go ahead

614
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,408
I have found...

615
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,776
Comrade, I'm Interpol Superintendent
Yang Jian-hua

616
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,446
You can't arrest those men

617
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:11,603
Your identification?

618
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,638
I don't have them on me

619
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,144
Really? Turn, raise your hands

620
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,454
Let's go examine the goods now

621
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:20,946
They're leaving

622
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,450
We can't wait; we'll check them

623
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,698
Interpol Superintendent Yang calling

624
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,366
Please go ahead

625
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,833
Men...

626
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,547
Stop, we're the police

627
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,383
Don't move, we're the police

628
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,489
Careful

629
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:21,900
Do you know how to throw these?

630
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:22,935
At least I scared him

631
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,842
Out of my way

632
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:34,379
What are you doing? I'm a policeman

633
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,323
What are you doing?

634
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,257
Hua-nui is still there

635
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,318
Run now, save her later

636
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,353
Freeze

637
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,988
Bring them in

638
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,957
Superintendent Yang

639
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,128
Run and I'll shoot

640
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,937
Freeze

641
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,406
You're clear, go ahead

642
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,239
Lin Fu-seng, we've found you

643
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,946
You robbed the vegetable depot...
and People's Bank

644
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,374
You're a daring bastard

645
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,144
And you took on a new guy?

646
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,513
I'll arrest you

647
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,865
Go, quickly

648
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:18,899
Let's go, hurry

649
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,599
Thank you, sir

650
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,568
Pao, Hua-nui is still there

651
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,042
Never mind, come now
Do you want to go to jail again?

652
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,307
Hurry, Hua-nui

653
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,132
Stupid Bear, so careless

654
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,631
Hua-nui, you are really great

655
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,829
What's wrong?

656
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,864
I killed a policeman

657
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,673
That's normal, killing them

658
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,005
You can't let them kill you

659
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,505
I'll be executed!

660
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,407
I know, so what now?

661
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,542
Come to Hong Kong with me

662
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,007
All right

663
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,115
You're really bringing her to Hong Kong?

664
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,411
I can take you

665
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,548
Of course I can take her, too

666
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,085
We can't let her get caught here

667
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,548
Thank you, Pao

668
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,350
You are both excellent

669
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,023
Let's go

670
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,598
Damn stun gun;
I must bring one to Hong Kong

671
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,428
You really killed a policeman?

672
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,164
Oh, yes

673
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,368
May I come in?

674
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,247
You're so rude; come in

675
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,339
I'm your brother

676
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:20,746
What is it?

677
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,256
Why are you suddenly coming along?

678
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,515
Orders from above

679
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,251
Do they know I can't protect you...

680
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,451
if you came along?

681
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,463
They want me to protect you

682
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,599
You'll just get in my way

683
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,265
You're too macho

684
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:36,762
The Commander...

685
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:39,464
What is it, Fu-seng?

686
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:42,407
This wench dares talk back to me
and won't obey when I teach her

687
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,568
I'm teaching her a lesson now

688
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:44,603
What wench?

689
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,907
Mao said, "Women hold up half the sky"

690
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,241
He did?

691
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,321
You two stop fighting

692
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,886
We're near the observation tower
turn off the lights

693
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,147
Come out and help

694
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,826
You hit me so hard when I'm your brother

695
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,530
Would it be better if I'm your husband?

696
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,528
You should have said so sooner

697
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,610
We are the Royal Hong Kong Police

698
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,205
Stop the boat for inspection

699
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,344
We are the Royal Hong Kong Police

700
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,854
Stop the boat for inspection
Stop the boat

701
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,882
Fu-seng

702
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,175
A trap door

703
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,449
Hurry to the back

704
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,104
Fei, go look; I'll take over

705
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,205
Pao, two motors are destroyed

706
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,675
I'm not that easy to catch

707
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,681
Don't

708
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,255
Get away, don't stop me

709
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,832
Pao

710
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:57,438
Get away or I'll beat you up

711
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,175
The speedboat is coming

712
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,919
You dare play tricks on me?

713
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,096
Pao

714
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,596
Pao is coming up

715
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,301
Pierre

716
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,347
Pao, you're finally here

717
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,349
It's been a long time

718
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,645
How are you? About the same

719
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,309
That's good

720
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:08,909
Where is Boss?

721
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:09,646
Waiting for you

722
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:10,653
I'll go see him

723
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:11,676
Yes

724
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,583
Hi, sweethearts; can I join you girls?

725
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,351
Sure, sit down

726
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,458
I have some new stuff for you

727
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,764
Who wants to try it first?

728
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,761
Come on, give me your hand

729
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,794
Fu-seng, come

730
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,969
Relax, you will have a wonderful time

731
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,133
Okay

732
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:43,115
Close your eyes; you enjoy

733
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,159
Boss

734
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,595
Pao

735
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,228
Sit down

736
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,899
Let me finish this game

737
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,649
You look well, you must have
lived the high life in camp

738
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,838
Thankfully I left quickly

739
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,110
You said you wanted me to meet
two new members of your team

740
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,443
Yes

741
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,013
I can be here thanks only to
the two of them

742
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,551
Game Over

743
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,152
Who are they?

744
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,424
Fu-seng, and Hua-nui

745
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:38,363
Throw them into the ocean

746
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:39,170
What?

747
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,074
Throw them into the ocean

748
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,769
Boss

749
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,107
Jail made you lose your
awareness?

750
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,683
You brought two police here to see me?

751
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,846
Throw them into the ocean

752
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,559
Wait

753
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,727
Fu-seng

754
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,096
Hua-nui

755
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,001
I was going to do big business with you

756
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:15,704
But your boss treats us like this

757
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,536
I give you face

758
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:21,706
Let's go

759
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:23,475
Such a good chance

760
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,509
The gun is empty

761
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,744
How would you know?

762
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,799
People in my business must be careful

763
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,378
I like you both

764
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,106
Welcome to me team

765
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,373
Thank the Boss

766
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,377
Thank you, Boss

767
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,120
Boss, that woman died after her shot

768
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,425
That's fine

769
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,622
Johnny is an expert in putting drugs
into corpses

770
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,727
See if he'll find it useful Yes

771
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,330
Reuse and recycle

772
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,532
What is your name?

773
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,831
I'm Hua-nui

774
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:24,073
Have her try on the bullet-proof vest

775
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,370
Sure, follow me

776
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,413
Tomorrow, Hua-nui will go with me

777
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,445
Let me break the record now

778
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,548
Pao

779
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,151
What are we doing tomorrow that
requires a bullet-proof vest?

780
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,124
I'll tell you tomorrow

781
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,519
Come, watch Boss play his video game

782
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,633
Boss, Qiang betrayed Kunchat

783
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,331
Shall we have him dive?

784
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,261
Do the usual

785
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,000
Boss

786
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,673
Lawyer Chan is calling long distance
He needs to speak to you

787
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,173
Chan? Yes

788
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,781
Out of the way

789
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:13,485
Throw him in

790
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,634
He betrayed Boss

791
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,164
He deserves it

792
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,235
Come up

793
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,273
The phone, Boss

794
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,702
I don't care of we win or lose the lawsuit

795
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,168
But you must ask her to return the
bank code

796
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,804
Don't try your best, you must do it

797
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,443
I know how to reward good work

798
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,316
General

799
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,989
Welcome, Khun Chaibat

800
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,680
Too much rainfall in the Golden Triangle...

801
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,617
caused a bad harvest

802
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,887
I'm afraid I don't have goods for you

803
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,917
Where are your goods?

804
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,759
I can only get 30%, that's not enough

805
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:32,400
I don't care what you guys want,
I want 3 tons

806
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:36,494
You heard it, the two of them already...
took half of my stock

807
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,365
Give me the rest

808
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:41,567
Sorry, I reserved the rest long ago

809
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,070
Don't give anything to others

810
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,839
Do you set the rules now?

811
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,145
You think you're Bush?

812
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,515
I just to tell you today

813
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,224
I won't have any goods for you this year

814
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,487
So the purpose of today's meeting...

815
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,325
is to divide up my share

816
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,999
Is mine not business?
Does my money stink?

817
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:12,074
Who dares say that

818
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,367
But I've heard...

819
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:19,442
who hasn't paid for the previous delivery?

820
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:20,605
I haven't

821
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,278
I have a lot of money in a Swiss bank

822
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,311
If someone had not notified the
Malaysian police...

823
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,479
and had my wife arrested...

824
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,250
I would not owe you

825
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,523
You wife was arrested in Malaysia?

826
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,995
She may tell them about us

827
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,668
Control yourself

828
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,474
Chaibat, you cannot take action

829
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,639
He betrayed me

830
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,910
Talk is cheap
You intend to threaten us? With what?

831
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,218
With what?

832
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,650
General, this is good stuff

833
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,690
What is the matter?

834
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:13,725
It's a signal from Boss

835
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,131
Let me see

836
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,568
Don't move

837
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:22,734
No one shoot

838
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,373
These vests are packed with dynamite

839
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:26,571
I just fire one shot

840
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,947
We will all die together

841
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,340
Boss

842
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,312
Is my sister all right

843
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,620
Don't worry
She'll be fine with Boss

844
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,584
When you hear the explosion...

845
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,722
deal with those two guys for me

846
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:40,798
Can you do it?

847
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:41,639
Yes

848
00:56:41,678 --> 00:56:42,667
Good

849
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,769
Put down your gun

850
00:56:49,452 --> 00:56:51,079
Don't think you can take advantage...

851
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:52,510
of me, and betray me...

852
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:55,220
because you speak the same language

853
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:57,916
Chaibat, please understand

854
00:56:58,328 --> 00:56:59,659
I am a businessman

855
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,857
If you have so many private matters...

856
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:04,926
solve it before you talk to me

857
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:06,624
Let's go out

858
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,837
General!

859
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:11,801
I did it, so what?

860
00:57:13,943 --> 00:57:15,308
No one may leave this hut

861
00:57:16,479 --> 00:57:18,743
Surround the hut

862
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:23,541
I've put up with you long enough

863
00:57:23,953 --> 00:57:25,318
Don't even think about leaving here today

864
00:57:25,989 --> 00:57:27,650
Shoot if you dare, fire!
