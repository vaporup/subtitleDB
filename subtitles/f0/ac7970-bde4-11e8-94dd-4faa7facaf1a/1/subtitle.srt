1
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,211
Shangkuan, your Eagle's Claw
has destroyed my Snake's Fist school.

2
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,339
Damn you for killing my students!

3
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,058
The Eagle's Claw and Snake's Fist
are mortal enemies.

4
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,498
It is God's will that your diabolical sect
has been destroyed.

5
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,452
As grand master of my school,
I must avenge my dead.

6
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,180
Surely you realise that
your technique is inferior to mine?

7
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,935
I do this to honour my ancestors,
and though I may die today -

8
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,777
- my descendants will ensure
the Snake's Fist doesn't die with me.

9
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,771
Yes, and as long as
Pai Chang-tien lives -

10
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,092
- the flag of the Snake's Fist still flies!

11
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,213
After I've killed you,
Pai Chang-tien is next!

12
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,848
- Where's Pai Chang-tien?
- He's very sly. You won't find him!

13
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,011
Pai Chang-tien...

14
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,896
GUEST HOUSE

15
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,288
I told you not to bother me.
Do you want to die?

16
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,573
No flies on me!

17
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,370
- He owes a month's rent!
- Inn-keeper, be reasonable...

18
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,179
So, he won't pay...

19
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,337
I'll pay you, just give me two days.

20
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,773
See what's in the basket.

21
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,418
What are you doing?

22
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,537
- That's just my snake.
- A snake!

23
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,697
Stop him!

24
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,618
Remember, always use your head!

25
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,012
I can't jaw away all day.
It's hard to stomach, I know.

26
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,014
So, there's no chance of some grub.

27
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,251
What does my kick taste like?

28
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,336
My teeth!

29
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,254
"Cicada's escape."

30
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,058
One, two, three, four
and again, damn it!

31
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,415
You've been bowled over!

32
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,930
Bowl... chopsticks...
bowl... chopsticks!

33
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,417
- I'll... kill... you!
- Using a weapon? Really, brother...

34
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,179
- I must run.
- Come back, you scoundrel!

35
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,933
Excuse me...

36
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,373
Come back!

37
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,980
- What's up?
- That damned rascal had a snake!

38
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,857
A snake...

39
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,532
HUNG-TAI SCHOOL

40
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,931
- Chien-fu, don't neglect your chores.
- I'm... I'm not!

41
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,929
- So, you're splashing me...?
- Sorry. I'll wipe it up.

42
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,770
Damn fool!

43
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,613
- I didn't mean...
- Simpleton!

44
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,775
Clean it up.

45
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,334
That will teach you
to take more care next time.

46
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,057
While the master's away,
Li and I will be in charge.

47
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,338
Today, I'll teach you "dragon-tiger fist".

48
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:35,178
- Then you'll be able to beat ten men.
- Ten eggs maybe.

49
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,135
And don't forget to pay your fees!

50
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,815
Master Li and I will demonstrate.

51
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,209
Watch closely.

52
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,896
- Dragon-fist!
- Tiger-fist!

53
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,132
- Nice going!
- Impressive, huh?

54
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,294
- Stop laughing!
- What's so funny?!

55
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,975
What are you laughing at?!
- Chien-fu!

56
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,375
Why laugh at your teacher?

57
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,338
- What's so funny?
- What?

58
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,257
Ah, Chien-fu...

59
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,539
Fighters must be fast,
accurate and ferocious.

60
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,169
I'll now demonstrate
"golden dragon's claw".

61
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,492
Ready... Observe how
the abdomen is now exposed.

62
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,211
- A hit!
- You see, a hit!

63
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,976
The next stance is "preying-tiger".

64
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,736
Stretch out your hand.
No, no... the other one.

65
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,449
Exposed again...
I didn't tell you to resist.

66
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,534
An irresistable attack.

67
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,217
- Well, was it fantastic?
- Fantastic!

68
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,894
Remember what you've learnt today.

69
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,138
- Carry on with your practice.
- Come on, get moving.

70
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,011
Were you used as
a human punchbag again?

71
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,699
Shall I apply some balm for you?

72
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,011
HING-WEI SCHOOL

73
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,890
I'll rest here.

74
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,658
Here is your drink, magistrate.

75
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,819
It's an honour to welcome the owner -

76
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:15,060
- of so many restaurants,
pawn shops and funeral parlours.

77
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,055
Although your son is as fat as a pig...

78
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,018
More evidence of your prosperity.

79
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,218
But if he doesn't train his muscles -

80
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,372
- they'll lose the strength
so evident in his father.

81
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,533
Yes, there's truth in what you say.

82
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,296
It's for this reason
that I want my son to learn kung fu.

83
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,492
It's true that there are many
martial arts schools in our province...

84
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,934
Really? So why haven't I heard of it?

85
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,093
If you don't believe me,
believe your own eyes.

86
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,417
I've seen guys in the street
break bricks with their bare hands.

87
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,769
- Can your students do that?
- Such feats are simplicity itself for us.

88
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,648
Demonstrate your brick breaking
for young master.

89
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,411
Breaking stone with your fists
is a marvellous feeling.

90
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,729
Wait! Hold it...

91
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,496
Feel up to it?

92
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,334
Sure, no problem.

93
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,455
That's superb!

94
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,297
- That was marvellous!
- Not at all...

95
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:26,735
One of our students is competing
in the Three Provinces Championship.

96
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,288
- Really?
- Sure!

97
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,579
- You'd like to study here?
- Yes, I want to join this school.

98
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,209
It's agreed then, he'll start tomorrow.

99
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,655
One moment...
The magistrate's leaving!

100
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,689
I'm coming!

101
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,739
Say goodbye to our new pupil.

102
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,495
His hand looks crushed!
I'm not staying here.

103
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,937
Father, let's try Hung-tai School...

104
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,694
But magistrate...

105
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,969
Magistrate! Magistrate!

106
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,451
Get inside...

107
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,652
The sight of this layabout
is driving away business.

108
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,731
- Get rid of him!
- Yes!!

109
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,060
- What...?
- Who said you could sleep here?

110
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,098
Sorry, I'll leave at once.

111
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,651
Stop! You can't beat an old man!

112
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,008
- He's got guts. Who is he?
- He's from Hung-tai School.

113
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,568
Hung-tai School? Beat him!

114
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,931
Get him!

115
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,494
- Are you hurt?
- No!

116
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,254
Not my hand again!

117
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,459
My back!

118
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:54,370
Brothers, in the name of God,
don't fight! Brothers, stop fighting!

119
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,219
- Don't, brothers...
- Why not?

120
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,539
If a man strikes one cheek,
offer him the other.

121
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,156
That's your advice?

122
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,196
You dare... God won't forgive you!

123
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,629
- This way.
- Are you hurt?

124
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,349
- No, I'm used to blows!
- You're used to them?

125
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,874
This is the back door
of Hung-tai School. Come in and rest.

126
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,316
This is the back yard.
Very few people come here.

127
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,709
I live in this store room.

128
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,638
Cat, cat, cat
speak to our guest in the hat.

129
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,670
There...

130
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,479
Have a seat.

131
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,118
- Have a bowl of hot tea.
- Thanks.

132
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,676
- Why don't you drink?
- I never drink hot tea.

133
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,594
- I'll get a cold one.
- Good...

134
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,437
Chang, finished your shopping?

135
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,674
Old man, he's our cook.
His cooking is very tasty.

136
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,151
Save your flattery. And this is...?

137
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,920
He's my relative.

138
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,230
Chang, I haven't eaten yet.

139
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,114
Help yourself.
I've kept your meal warm for you.

140
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,670
I have to serve the guests.

141
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,672
Magistrate, I assure you...

142
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,912
The students here
find it's only a matter of time -

143
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,639
- before they become invincible.

144
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,436
Mr. Li, you must be a great teacher!

145
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,516
Is that so? Wei-wu School has
sent students to the championship.

146
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,591
Can you say the same?

147
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,434
What's so special about entering
students for the competition?

148
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,437
Although our Mr. Hung will be present
for the contest - he's the judge.

149
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,559
If he's the judge,
then his kung fu must be splendid.

150
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,030
Naturally, he was the best in his day.

151
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,874
- How many bricks can he break?
- Bricks?

152
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,516
I don't teach party tricks,
I teach real kung fu.

153
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,394
Young master, you were obviously
born to be a good fighter.

154
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:00,431
You're clever and tactful. Study here,
and you'll soon be an expert.

155
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,229
- Really?
- Of course!

156
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,713
Chang, bring Chien-fu here.

157
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,830
- What's your name?
- I'm Chien-fu.

158
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,878
- Your father was called Chien?
- No, sir.

159
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,350
I'm an orphan. The school took me in.

160
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,319
They say Chien is a good name
for someone simple-minded like me.

161
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,309
- What's your name?
- Oh...

162
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,155
Chien-fu... Mr. Li wants to see you.

163
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,077
You take it easy, old man.
I'll be back soon, so don't go away.

164
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,952
This is the young master
of Chin-san Bank.

165
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,830
He has been here a month,
and his progress is remarkable.

166
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,079
You see this big guy?
He's one tough cookie, I assure you.

167
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,714
Chien-fu, fight with Bean
for the benefit of our guests.

168
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,190
But don't resist, got it?

169
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,236
Be careful.

170
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,912
Begin.

171
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,392
Good! Beat him... Beat him!

172
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,595
You dare to fight back
and disobey Mr. Li?

173
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,831
Hit him!

174
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,120
Stop! That's enough!

175
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,831
Chien-fu, rest up
and you'll be better in no time.

176
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,271
Father, I want to stay here!

177
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,349
Chien-fu, are you okay?

178
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,749
- I'm alright.
- Alright... You've been fighting.

179
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,310
I haven't... It was...

180
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,516
You don't understand.
He's the school's human punchbag.

181
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,791
A punchbag?

182
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,191
Mr. Li forces him
to take the punishment.

183
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,633
Chien-fu, can you grab the bowl?

184
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,750
I don't think you can.

185
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,060
Old man... Old man?

186
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,036
Shabby cat...

187
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:34,119
"Twist and turn, in a blur
of hands and feet. Writhe like a snake"

188
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,830
"Be supple like a willow before the wind"

189
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:47,916
What is this...?
"Twist and turn..."

190
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,996
The old man's showing me
his tricks... Well, here goes!

191
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,636
Show some mercy
for the poor beggar.

192
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,792
I bring the message of the Lord.
Only His words can save you.

193
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,639
Have mercy on me.

194
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,633
What's the idea of begging at this hour?

195
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,598
Get out of my sight!

196
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,116
That's one fierce lady.

197
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,918
Wretched sinner, ask for
God's forgiveness before it's too late.

198
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,232
just who do you think
you're calling a sinner?!

199
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,555
jesus Christ wants to save you.

200
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,030
Save me? You mean fool me!

201
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,353
Take that, and that! And be
more careful who you call a sinner!

202
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,592
Thanks, lady. You're very kind.

203
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:11,753
Believe in God and eternal life,
for this is His gift to man.

204
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,399
- Anyone home?
- Why call so early?

205
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,237
jesus Christ died for us, so that
we might experience heavenly joy.

206
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,793
Come in if you want joy! My girls
specialise in bringing it to you!

207
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,279
BROTHEL

208
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,713
Don't be shy, come in!
Chun-hua, Chun-yuen! Foreign meat!

209
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,713
You sinners, you'll all go to hell!

210
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,730
Anyone here?

211
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,412
Leaving already?

212
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,969
- Are you looking for Chao Chi-chih?
- Who? I'm looking for food.

213
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,612
What a sad sight you are.

214
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,736
Let me end your misery!

215
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,938
You want to flee, Pai Chang-tien?

216
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,618
Renounce violence!

217
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,130
That's right!

218
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,529
Good!

219
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,692
- Marvellous!
- Your hand should be straight.

220
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,533
- Ah-Kuei!
- Father!

221
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,458
Finished work for the day?

222
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,496
Please sit, sit...

223
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,016
I've come to check on
Ah-Kuei's progress.

224
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,732
You son is a genius,
and he studies extremely hard.

225
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,099
He has good muscles,
fine posture and rock-hard fists.

226
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,570
He has a very bright future before him!

227
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,250
Is this true?

228
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,856
- Have you fought with others yet?
- No, I haven't.

229
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,219
You want to fight?
That's easily arranged.

230
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,690
Chien-fu, come here.

231
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,418
Chien-fu, let's see what
the young master is made of.

232
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,697
You know what I expect.

233
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,730
Young master, don't hit too hard.

234
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,012
Begin!

235
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,172
- Your son fights marvellously.
- So it seems!

236
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,697
Come on!

237
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,729
- Stand still, damn it!
- You have to be faster!

238
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,899
You've asked for it!
My dragon-tiger fist!

239
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,292
Lord in heaven!
Magistrate, are you hurt?

240
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,814
Here's a new move for the great guru
to teach his students.

241
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,014
Ah-kuei, let's get out of here
and go to Wei-wu School.

242
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,655
Magistrate, please!
just allow me to explain...

243
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:56,175
Well, smart guy, you've succeeded
in ruining my reputation.

244
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,177
Now, get out of my sight!

245
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,819
Old man!

246
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,894
- Old man, what happened?
- I was ambushed...

247
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,773
I... I must get help.

248
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,375
Chien-fu... just find a safe place
for me to rest.

249
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,932
Old man... Old man!

250
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,978
PHARMACY

251
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,137
Old man...

252
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,579
Boss!

253
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,369
Chao Chi-chih has been living here.

254
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,250
- How long since he left?
- A month.

255
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,739
Pai Chang-tien is wounded,
he'll seek out Chao Chi-chih.

256
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:24,498
He's bound to leave a trail.
It is your task to discover it.

257
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,813
The picture is ancient,
but the words are new.

258
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,648
The man you seek
awaits you in heaven.

259
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,010
You're awake.

260
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,135
How are you feeling now?

261
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,814
I'll be alright.

262
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,337
That's good news,
I've been very worried about you.

263
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,695
I'll get your medicine.

264
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,253
Drink this, it will give you strength.

265
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,853
Chien-fu, I am indebted to you.

266
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,376
It's nothing. We're friends, aren't we?

267
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,056
And you taught me
how to avoid being hit.

268
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,655
- Well, has it proved useful?
- Yes...

269
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,255
But I irritated Mr. Li and he beat me.

270
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:15,617
- Do you want to learn kung fu?
- Yes, then no one can victimise me.

271
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,409
You must promise me three things.

272
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,770
I'll gladly keep a hundred promises.

273
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:27,016
Firstly, you must never
refer to me as your master.

274
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,298
- Why not?
- Because we're good friends.

275
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:38,331
Secondly, don't reveal what you've
learnt, unless conflict is unavoidable.

276
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,411
Okay, and third?

277
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,018
Promise that you will not come
to my aid if I fight with my enemies.

278
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,888
How can I promise not to help
if you are losing?!

279
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,336
You must promise me this.

280
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,253
Okay, I promise.

281
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,730
- What will you teach me?
- The Snake's Fist.

282
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,330
Shabby cat,
are you missing your master?

283
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,971
You must eat or you'll waste away.

284
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,659
So, smart guy, you want to take me on?

285
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,060
You're becoming crafty.

286
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,176
You're slipping.

287
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:13,299
- Mr. Li, be careful.
- I'm always careful.

288
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,539
- Son of a bitch!
- I said take care.

289
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,417
- Are you hurt?
- Damn it!

290
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,776
Are you here looking for trouble?

291
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,889
I've won the Three
Provinces Championship.

292
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:05,214
Every kung fu school has
congratulated me, except yours.

293
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:08,420
“flu-w

294
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,890
- You need to learn respect.
- You're challenging us?

295
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,017
Yes! Who's first?

296
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,810
You're too sure of yourself,
my friend. Therefore, I...

297
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,291
- Yes, he...
- ...nominate my pupil.

298
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,257
You're in big trouble!

299
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,094
- Mr. Li, I defer to you.
- Not at all.

300
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,252
You must have this privilege.

301
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:41,575
I can't deny you this golden opportunity,
you lucky fellow. Go right ahead.

302
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:46,859
- Please, Master Li, after you...
- No, no, after you...

303
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,771
Shut up! I'll take on both of you at once.

304
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,535
- You go high, I'll go low.
- We'll attack front and back.

305
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,458
He's trapped now!

306
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,779
That was a textbook attack!

307
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,889
My braid!

308
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,328
- I won't use my hands.
- That's more like it!

309
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:21,293
The champion is fantastic.
Let's join Hung-wei School!

310
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,208
Go somewhere else. We're closed...

311
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,219
Master Hung... Master Hung!

312
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,977
Hung, why aren't you
giving classes to your pupils?

313
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:37,931
If you've nothing to do,
you can be my assistant!

314
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,610
I came here to fight.

315
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:49,290
Master Hung, no one forced
your students to join my school.

316
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:55,213
You took advantage of my absence
and stole my students.

317
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:59,896
- You can't deny it.
- The boys study where they please.

318
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,095
Then we will settle this by combat.

319
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:10,413
So, that's it? Well,
I fancy my chances against you.

320
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,575
Chien-fu, stand aside.

321
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:05,291
You posture like a hero,
but you fight like a dog!

322
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,256
Master!

323
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,130
Remain where you are.

324
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,854
My brother's coming!

325
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:24,049
Master Hung, as I caused
this dispute, I will settle it.

326
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:31,294
- Be careful, he's very powerful.
- Get back.

327
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,698
- You're the so-called champion?
- I have that honour.

328
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:13,575
Under no circumstances
use the snake's fist that I taught you.

329
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,218
Master!

330
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:10,059
- That's enough, okay?
- You clearly have a death wish.

331
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:14,177
Don't come closer! I won't fight...

332
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,331
This is for throwing shoes...

333
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,818
- Get up!
- That's enough, okay?

334
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:33,739
So, you're not a total novice....

335
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:38,379
- What stance is that?
- This is the "angry mantis"!

336
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,699
Mantis, beware the snake!

337
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:47,218
"Mantis catches a cicada".

338
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,975
"Reverse snake".

339
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,372
- Chien-fu...
- Stay back!

340
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,368
Looks like Chien-fu just got angry!

341
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,058
I said I don't want to fight.

342
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,049
You can't move now?

343
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:39,572
Your kung fu is quite good,
but a little unreliable.

344
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:44,131
All that waving your arms...
You use bricks now?

345
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,336
- Why use a weapon?
- To impale a snake!

346
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,769
A snake with fangs!

347
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,099
This is "finding a snake".

348
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,171
Master, let's go.

349
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:44,335
Well done, Chien-fu!
Let's rejoin Hung-tai.

350
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,028
Chien-fu, I have had to leave
at very short notice.

351
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,756
Study this book on Snake's Fist
kung fu, until my return.

352
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,159
He's gone...

353
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,592
Old man!

354
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,512
Old man!

355
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,314
Where have you gone?

356
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,114
Who are you?

357
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:58,440
- Were you looking for the old man?
- I... Yes.

358
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:08,029
- I'm looking for him, too.
- Why do you want him?

359
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,636
- Who are you?
- What's it to you?

360
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,474
He's my mas...

361
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,518
So, he's your master?

362
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,798
Then you should call me uncle.

363
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,192
- You're the brother of old man?
- Yes!

364
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:34,034
- I don't believe it!
- You don't believe...

365
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,714
"Standing snake."

366
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,510
- "Snake at the front."
- just like my mas...

367
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,831
It looks right, but I'm not convinced.

368
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,549
You still don't believe me?

369
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,634
- Very well, let's fight.
- Fight? Why not?

370
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,999
Uncle, take it easy! I'm choking...

371
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:37,552
You've practised hard,
but not hard enough.

372
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,508
Stay down,
or I'll convince you some more.

373
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,478
You think so? Watch out!

374
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,953
- What else can you do?
- I can roll!

375
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,756
I writhe!

376
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,835
You missed me.

377
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,472
I've been using kid gloves with you,
but now they're off!

378
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,431
"Finding the snake."

379
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,835
This snake is too fast.

380
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,514
"Snake taking a pearl."
That's too obvious.

381
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,072
Un... cle... it... hurts.

382
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,910
- Are you okay?
- Uncle...

383
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,632
- Did you pull your punches?
- Of course. After all, I'm your uncle.

384
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,111
Your attacks seem different
to my master's.

385
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,795
That's because your master
didn't teach you everything.

386
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,191
Will you teach me?

387
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,592
I must have your master's
permission. Where is he?

388
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,312
- He just left.
- Left?

389
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,075
- Where has he gone?
- I don't know, but he'll be back.

390
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,073
- When will he return?
- He didn't tell me.

391
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,709
But I'll inform you when he does.

392
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,275
Good! But don't let him know
that I'm looking for him.

393
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,154
- I want to give him a surprise.
- Okay.

394
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,071
Why does uncle
fight so differently to my master?

395
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,709
Where's the book?

396
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,911
It must have been the cat.

397
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,831
Catch it!

398
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:17,158
Your claws are very fierce, cat!

399
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,094
Cat's claw with snake's fist!

400
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,991
Chao Chi-chih!

401
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,510
So, old man,
Shangkuan has snared you both!

402
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:48,954
Yes, Chao was in the hills, near
heaven. But heaven is still far away.

403
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,679
The two of you can rot here.

404
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,559
Hsiao chin, you must be dreaming
if you think I die so easily!

405
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,312
The weather is cool,
I don't need fanning.

406
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,832
Hold that pose...

407
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,751
Old man!

408
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,276
- Where were you?
- I had urgent business.

409
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,717
- I missed you. Why take so long?
- I missed you too.

410
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,154
- Chien-fu, the tea's ready!
- Coming.

411
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,710
Ah... thanks!

412
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,597
It's hot!

413
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,271
A man came looking for you
after you'd left.

414
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,352
- Who was he?
- You'd recognise him.

415
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,797
I'd recognise him? Who was it?

416
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,429
You sit here, I'll tell you later.

417
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:45,077
Uncle, the old man's back.
I'll take you to him!

418
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:53,835
Hurry! It's not far...
I haven't told him about you.

419
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,512
This way!

420
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,029
Hey, wait for me!

421
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,831
Preacher?

422
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,480
What did you call me?

423
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,235
I follow the Eagle's Claw, not God.

424
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,916
What are you saying?
I don't understand.

425
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,710
We will wipe the Snake's Fist
from the face of the Earth.

426
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,348
And the man you call uncle
is our leader. He has fooled you.

427
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,431
You really are scum!

428
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,755
I almost lost my feet!

429
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,039
Pai Chang-tien,
running any further is futile!

430
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,437
Shangkuan...

431
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:48,356
Are you so sure that the eagle
will always triumph over the snake?

432
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:57,070
Today marks the end of the war
between the eagle and the snake...

433
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,674
The end of the Snake's Fist!

434
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:06,359
I will oppose you with the last breath
in my body. I do not fear death!

435
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,157
Then allow me to take your life!

436
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,109
"The eagle swoops."

437
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,388
I'll rip out your heart!

438
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,479
Pai Chang-tien,
time for the snake to shed its skin!

439
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,798
A stone to sharpen your claws on!

440
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,195
It was dishonourable
to pretend to be my uncle -

441
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,239
- so that you could trick me
into leading you to him.

442
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:57,714
You've got guts, hero...
I'll tear them from your body!

443
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:03,477
You can't hurt him. I swear to you
he isn't my student.

444
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:08,793
Even if he disowns me,
I am proud to call him my master!

445
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,394
You follow the way of the snake.

446
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:17,350
All who wield the Snake's Fist
will be hunted down and slaughtered.

447
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:22,117
Slaughtered...
Master, he's dreaming!

448
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,875
Chien-fu, you can't beat him. Run!

449
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:30,351
Master, do you expect me
to flee from this wretch?!

450
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:37,069
It seems that to shut your lying mouth,
I'll have to remove your tongue.

451
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,432
And I'll shave your moustache!

452
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:13,070
- This isn't Snake's Fist... What is it?
- Cat's claw!

453
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,356
Chien-fu!

454
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,957
- What fighting prowess!
- Chang!

455
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,395
Why are you here?

456
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:31,316
- Where did you learn to fight like that?
- My master taught me!

457
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:35,109
Good... fantastic!

458
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,990
It's okay, your master's here!

459
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:48,638
Don't be so pleased with yourselves.

460
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:52,315
The tea that you drank was poisoned.

461
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,597
You're both going to die very soon.

462
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:08,600
No one can resist
Poison Eagle of Eagle's Claw.

463
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,275
Master never drinks hot tea.

464
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,989
I changed it!

465
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,800
Chien-fu, that was brilliant!

466
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:51,354
You combined Snake's Fist with
cat's claw to destroy the Eagle's Claw.

467
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,632
Such an elegant solution
deserves an elegant name.

468
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:00,036
- Master, you name it.
- How about...

469
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,636
- "Snake in the eagle's shadow."
- "Snake in the eagle's shadow" it is!
