1
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:26,217
If you pair of deuces
are lookin’ for work,

2
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:30,387
I suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here, pronto.

3
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,735
Now, up on Brokeback

4
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:48,739
the Forest Service has got designated campsites
on the allotments.

5
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:52,743
Them camps can be 3 or 4 miles
from where we pasture the woollies.

6
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:56,747
Bad predator loss, ’cause nobody’s
lookin’ after ’em at night.

7
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,749
Now, what I want

8
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,709
is a camp tender

9
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:04,755
to stay at the main camp
where the Forest Service says.

10
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:09,510
But the herder, he’s gonna
pitch a pup tent on the Q.T. with the sheep,

11
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,762
and he’s gonna sleep there.

12
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:14,765
You eat your supper and breakfast at camp.

13
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,767
But you sleep with the sheep.

14
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,769
A hundred percent.

15
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,772
No fire, don’t leave no sign.

16
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:25,693
You roll up that tent very morning
in case the Forest Service snoops around.

17
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,737
Yeah?

18
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,699
No.

19
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,743
No!

20
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:40,708
Not on your fuckin’ life.

21
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:44,962
You got your dogs, a .30-.30.
You sleep there.

22
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:50,801
Last summer I had a goddam near 25% loss.
I don’t want that again.

23
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,761
You...

24
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:56,807
Fridays at noon to by down by the bridge,

25
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,809
with a grocery list and mules.

26
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:01,812
Somebody with supplies,

27
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:05,816
will be there at the pick-up.

28
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:09,737
Tomorrow morning we’ll truck you up
to the jump off.

29
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,849
Jack Twist.

30
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,851
Ennis.

31
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,853
Your folks just stopped at Ennis?

32
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,813
Del Mar.

33
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:49,777
Nice to know you, Ennis Del Mar.

34
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:09,880
My second year up here.

35
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,884
Last year, one storm,
the lightning killed 42 sheep.

36
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:17,888
I thought I’d asphyxiate from the smell.

37
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:21,892
Aguirre got all over my ass,
like I was supposed to control the weather.

38
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,895
It beats working for my old man.

39
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:27,898
Can’t please my old man, no way.

40
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,900
That’s why I took the rodeo.

41
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,903
You ever rodeo?

42
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:36,907
Yeah... well... I mean once in a while.

43
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,909
When I got the entry fee in my pocket.

44
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,870
Yeah.

45
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:43,914
Are you from ranch people?

46
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,875
Yeah, I was.

47
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,920
Did your folks run you off?

48
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,923
No, they run themselves off.

49
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:56,927
There was, uh,
one curve in the road in 43 miles...

50
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,929
and they missed it.

51
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,931
So, uh...

52
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:04,852
the bank took the ranch, and
my brother and sister, they raised me mostly.

53
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:08,939
Shit!

54
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,900
That’s hard.

55
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,907
Can I?

56
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:42,973
One thing...

57
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,975
don’t ever order soup.

58
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,977
Them soup boxes are hard to pack.

59
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:50,898
I don’t eat soup.

60
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,986
Well, watch it there.

61
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,989
That horse has a low startle point.

62
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,992
Don’t think there’s a filly that can throw me.

63
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:05,913
When you get in this damn saddle
it’s kinda not so bad.

64
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,160
Shit.

65
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,081
Can’t wait till I get my own spread
and won’t have to put up with Joe Aguirre’s crap no more.

66
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,170
I’m savin’ for a place myself.

67
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,091
Alma and me, we’ll be getting married
when I come down off this mountain.

68
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:09,179
That stay with the sheep,
no fire bullshit.

69
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,100
Aguirre got no right makin’ us do
something against the rules.

70
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,817
No more beans.

71
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:48,279
Something wrong?

72
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,280
Yeah.

73
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,282
Why didn’t we get the powdered milk and the spuds?

74
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:55,202
It’s all we got.

75
00:13:56,287 --> 00:14:00,291
Well here’s next week’s.

76
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,293
I thought you didn’t eat soup.

77
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:04,295
Yeah, well, I’m sick of beans.

78
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:08,215
Too early in the summer to be sick of beans.

79
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,260
Come on.

80
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,297
Whoa there, whoa, whoa!

81
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,397
Where the hell you been?

82
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:50,317
I been up with the sheep all day,
I’m hungry as hell and all I find is beans.

83
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:57,408
What in the hell happened, Ennis?

84
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:59,410
Come upon a bear, is what happened.

85
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,412
Goddam horse spooked, and the mules took off

86
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:04,415
and scattered food everywhere.

87
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:06,375
Beans is about all we got left.

88
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:10,087
Got whisky or something?

89
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:15,676
Dumbass mule!

90
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:25,436
God-damn!

91
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,396
Let me see.

92
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:34,445
Shit.

93
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:38,449
Well, we gotta do something about
this food situation.

94
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,451
Maybe I’ll shoot one of the sheep.

95
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:43,454
Yeah, what if Aguirre finds out, huh?

96
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:45,456
Supposed to guard the sheep, not eat ’em.

97
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:49,376
What’s the matter with you?
There are thousands of ’em.

98
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:52,421
Stick with beans.

99
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:56,425
Well, I won’t.

100
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:09,897
Whoo-wee! Yeah!

101
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:13,484
Was getting’ tired of your dumbass missin’.

102
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,486
Then we won’t.

103
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:19,406
Ain’t nothing you can do with fish
that can’t do with no elk.

104
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:55,276
Hey, I’m commutin’ four hours a day.

105
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,236
I come in for breakfast.

106
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:58,904
I go back to the sheep.

107
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,115
Evening get ’em bedded down,

108
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:03,534
come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.

109
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:08,539
I spend half the night checking for damn coyotes.

110
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:12,459
Aguirre got no right making me do this.

111
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,548
If you wanna switch,
I wouldn’t mind sleepin’ out there.

112
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:21,552
That ain’t the point.
Point is we both oughta be in this camp.

113
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:25,556
Goddam pup tent smells like cat piss or worse.

114
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:29,476
I wouldn’t mind bein’ out there.

115
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,564
Well, I’m happy to switch with you, but...

116
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:36,567
I warn you, I can’t cook worth a damn.

117
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:40,571
I am pretty good with a can opener though.

118
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:44,491
Well you can’t be no worse than me then.

119
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:57,713
You don’t get much sleep, I tell you that.

120
00:18:57,755 --> 00:19:00,841
Yeah. Come on

121
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,569
I saw a coyote up there.

122
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:23,781
A big son of a bitch.

123
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,617
Balls on him the size of apples.

124
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:30,621
Looked like he could eat himself a camel.

125
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,581
You want some of this hot water.

126
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,587
It’s all yours.

127
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:20,671
I don’t rodeo much myself.

128
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:24,675
What’s the point of riding
some piece of stock for 8 seconds?

129
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:26,677
Money’s a good point.

130
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,679
Uh-huh.

131
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,683
If you don’t get stomped winnin’ it.

132
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,685
Yeah.

133
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:36,687
Well, my old man,

134
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:38,647
he’s a bull rider.

135
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,692
Thanks.

136
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,612
Pretty well-known in his day.

137
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:48,699
Though he kept his secrets to himself.

138
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:52,620
Never taught me a thing,
never once come to see me ride.

139
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:00,544
There.

140
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:06,717
Your brother and sister do right by you?

141
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:10,638
They did the best they could
after my folks was gone.

142
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:14,725
Considerin’ they didn’t leave us nothin’ but

143
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:18,729
$24 and a coffee can.

144
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:21,732
They got me a year of high school.

145
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:25,653
That was before the transmission went on the pick-up.

146
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:31,659
Then my sis left,
met a rough-neck and moved to Casper.

147
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:34,995
Me and my brother, we...

148
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:37,581
we went and got ourselves some work
on a ranch up near Worland...

149
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,750
... till I was 19.

150
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,754
Then he got married, and uh...

151
00:21:43,754 --> 00:21:47,675
No more room for me.

152
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,719
That’s how come...

153
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:53,722
...me end up here.

154
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,733
What?

155
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:09,697
That’s more words than
you spoke in the past 2 weeks.

156
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:14,702
Hell, that’s the most I spoke in a year.

157
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,084
My dad, he was a farm roper.

158
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:25,838
He didn’t rodeo much though.
He thought rodeo cowboys was all fuck-ups.

159
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,803
The hell they are.

160
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:34,763
Well...

161
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,770
- Yeehaw.
- There you go.

162
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:44,607
Burn his guts out.

163
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:47,818
Wavin’ to the girls in the stands!

164
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:49,820
He’s kickin’ me to high heaven!

165
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:55,659
I think my dad was right.

166
00:23:41,872 --> 00:23:43,832
Tent don’t look right.

167
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,876
It ain’t goin’ nowhere.

168
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:47,836
Let it be.

169
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:51,882
That harmonica don’t sound quite right either.

170
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:54,885
That’s ’cause it got kinda flat,
when my mare threw me.

171
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:56,845
Oh yeah?

172
00:23:57,888 --> 00:24:00,891
I thought you said that mare couldn’t throw you.

173
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:02,893
Oh, she got lucky.

174
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:06,814
Yeah well, if I’d to listen to that harmonica,
I woulda broke it, too.

175
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:14,905
#I know I shall meet you
on that final day.#

176
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:17,908
#Water-walkin’ Jesus.#

177
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:21,912
#Take me away!#

178
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,835
My mama, she believes in the Pentecost.

179
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:29,879
Yeah?

180
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,924
What exactly is the Pentecost?

181
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:37,928
I mean, my folks they was Methodists.

182
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:41,932
The Pentecost... I don’t know.
I don’t know what the Pentecost is.

183
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:43,934
No one ever explained it to me.

184
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:46,937
I guess, when the world ends, and...

185
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:50,941
fellows like you and me,
we march off to Hell.

186
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:52,943
Speak for yourself.

187
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:56,864
You may be a sinner,
but I ain’t yet had the opportunity.

188
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:00,910
Thank you.

189
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:08,959
I’m gonna go up to the sheep now.

190
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,891
Damn, it’s too late to go to them sheep.

191
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:28,979
You got an extra blanket?

192
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,814
I’ll just roll up out here.

193
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,984
Catch forty winks.

194
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:37,905
I’ll ride out first light.

195
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,993
You’ll freeze your ass of
when that fire dies down.

196
00:25:42,993 --> 00:25:44,995
That’s good enough.

197
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,581
Ennis!

198
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,040
What?

199
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,961
Quit your hammerin’ and get in here.

200
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:51,372
What’re we doin’?

201
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:57,206
See you for supper.

202
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:59,375
Come on.

203
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:07,044
This is a one-shot thing we got goin’ on here.

204
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:13,300
It’s nobody’s business but ours.

205
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:17,054
You know I ain’t queer.

206
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:19,682
Me neither.

207
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:48,289
Twist.

208
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:51,792
Your Uncle Harold’s in the hospital
with pneumonia.

209
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,503
Doctors don’t expect he’ll make it.

210
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,799
Your ma sent me to tell you,
so... here I am.

211
00:35:01,385 --> 00:35:03,053
Bad news.

212
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:06,891
There ain’t nothing I can do about it up here, I guess.

213
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:10,144
There’s not much you can do about it down there, neither.

214
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,817
Unless you can cure pneumonia.

215
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:51,435
Jesus.

216
00:35:51,602 --> 00:35:54,605
Them sheep’ll drift if I don’t get back up there tonight.

217
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:58,609
You’ll get pissed in a storm like this.

218
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,195
And we sure ain’t tryin’.

219
00:36:01,237 --> 00:36:02,696
Close it up.

220
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:14,792
Well, what are we supposed to do now, huh?

221
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:19,547
Get on in there and untangle
them sheep out of ours, I guess.

222
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:23,342
...where is it..?

223
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,058
Maybe the Goddam sheep rachers were off.

224
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:32,726
We’ve gotta try.
The least we can do is get...

225
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:35,229
...the count right for Aguirre.

226
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:37,314
Fuck Aguirre.

227
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:41,569
Oh yeah, fuck Aguirre.
What if we need work next year?
You ever figure about that?

228
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:43,779
We gotta stick this out, Jack.

229
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:02,339
You’ll run them sheep off, if you don’t quiet down.

230
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,711
What are you doin’?

231
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:44,048
Aguirre came by again.

232
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:46,550
Said my uncle didn’t die after all.

233
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:49,470
Said to bring ’em down.

234
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:51,347
Bring ’em down?  Why?
It’s the middle of August.

235
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:53,432
Said there’s a storm comin’.

236
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:57,645
Comin’ in from the Pacific.
Worse than this one.

237
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:03,651
But that snow barely stuck an hour.

238
00:38:04,068 --> 00:38:07,738
That son-of-a-bitch, he’s cuttin’ us out
of a whole month’s pay.

239
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:09,698
It ain’t right.

240
00:38:12,743 --> 00:38:14,703
Well, I’d spare you a loan but
I’m short on cash.

241
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,748
I can give it to you when we get to Signal.

242
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:19,500
I don’t need your money.

243
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,086
I ain’t in the poorhouse.

244
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,046
Shit.

245
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:27,424
All right.

246
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,750
Time to get goin’, cowboy.

247
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,767
This ain’t no rodeo, cowboy.

248
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:48,339
Ennis... Ennis.

249
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:53,802
Come here.

250
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:50,067
Some of these never went up there with you.

251
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:54,655
The count ain’t what I’d hoped for, neither.

252
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:58,826
You ranch stiffs,
you ain’t ever no good.

253
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,050
You wanna give it some gas?

254
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:28,230
I can’t believe I left
my damn shirt up there.

255
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,529
You gonna do this again next summer?

256
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:39,867
Well, maybe not.  Like I said,
me and Alma’s gettin’ married in November.

257
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:46,874
So... I’ll try to get something on a ranch, I guess.

258
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,876
You?

259
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,881
Might go up to my daddy’s place.
Give him a hand through the winter.

260
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:59,887
I might be back.
If the army don’t get me.

261
00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:08,896
Well, I guess I’ll see you around, huh?

262
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:10,981
Right.

263
00:43:21,218 --> 00:43:25,973
What the fuck are you lookin’ at?
Huh?

264
00:43:34,064 --> 00:43:38,068
...forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us,

265
00:43:38,068 --> 00:43:40,029
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

266
00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:45,993
For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen.

267
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:49,622
Under the powers vested in me, I now
pronounce you man and wife.

268
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,044
You may kiss the bride.

269
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:57,755
And if you don’t, I will.

270
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:15,105
You all right?

271
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:23,948
Stop!
No, you stop!

272
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,123
My old lady’s tryin’ to get me to quit this job.

273
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:37,127
She says I get too old breaking my back
shovellin’ asphalt.

274
00:44:37,127 --> 00:44:41,131
I told her, strong backs
and weak mind runs in the family!

275
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:46,095
I told her it keeps me fit.

276
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,884
Yeah!

277
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:33,100
Well look what the wind blew in.

278
00:45:33,684 --> 00:45:35,352
Hi, Mr. Aguirre.

279
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:38,355
Wonderin’ if you was needin’ any help this summer.

280
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:40,774
You're wastin’ your time here.

281
00:45:41,817 --> 00:45:44,111
What, you ain’t got nothin’?

282
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:48,490
Nothin’ up on Brokeback?

283
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:52,870
I ain’t got no work for you.

284
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:04,298
Ennis Del Mar ain’t been around, has he?

285
00:46:06,383 --> 00:46:11,138
You boys sure found a way
to make the time pass up there.

286
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,646
Twist, you guys weren’t gettin’ paid
to leave the dogs to babysit the sheep

287
00:46:16,685 --> 00:46:18,806
while you stemmed the rose.

288
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,936
Now get the hell out of my trailer.

289
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,870
How are you girls doin’?

290
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:20,207
All right.
Jenny’s still got a runny nose.

291
00:47:41,896 --> 00:47:45,065
Ennis, could you wipe Alma Jr’s nose?

292
00:47:45,482 --> 00:47:52,239
If I had free hands I could!

293
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,280
Shh, come here.

294
00:48:18,516 --> 00:48:21,560
- Girls all right?
- Yeah

295
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:25,105
Jenny’s still got a cough.

296
00:48:25,731 --> 00:48:30,277
I think you should take the girls into town this
weekend and get ’em an ice-cream or somethin’?

297
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:38,452
Can’t we move to town?

298
00:48:39,537 --> 00:48:43,541
I’m tired of these lonesome old ranches.

299
00:48:43,874 --> 00:48:45,543
No one for Alma Jr. to play with,...

300
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:47,628
...besides, I’m scared for Jenny,...

301
00:48:47,836 --> 00:48:51,298
...scared she has another one of
them bad asthma spells.

302
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:59,306
No, rent in town’s too high.

303
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:01,183
There’s a cheap place in Riverton
over the laundromat.

304
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:03,477
I bet I could fix it up real nice.

305
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:08,315
I bet you could fix this place up
real nice if you wanted to.

306
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:14,405
I know you’d like it, too.

307
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:18,325
A real home,
lots of kids for the girls to play with.

308
00:49:20,578 --> 00:49:24,123
Not so lonely like you were raised.

309
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:29,336
You don’t want it to be so lonely, do you?

310
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,768
I ain’t so lonely now.

311
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:52,276
You sure the girls are asleep?

312
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:53,944
Sure.

313
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:07,583
Come here.

314
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:27,394
Let her rip..., boys
He’s hangin’ on for dear life

315
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:35,402
Watch out there, he’s coming for ya!
Send in the clowns!

316
00:50:36,487 --> 00:50:39,490
Shit.

317
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:45,412
Never mind folks,
there are the rodeo clowns!

318
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:08,811
I’d like to buy Jimbo here a beer.

319
00:51:06,308 --> 00:51:09,645
Best damn rodeo hand I ever worked with.

320
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:16,110
Thanks, cowboy. If I was to let every
rodeo hand I pulled a bull off of

321
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:18,821
buy me liquor I’d a been an alcoholic long ago.

322
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:29,540
Well, bullseye for you buccaroo, it’s just my job.

323
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,460
Save your money for your
next entry fee, cowboy.

324
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:51,478
You ever try calf ropin’?

325
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:56,400
Do I look like I can afford a fuckin’ ropin’ horse?

326
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:18,505
- Do you wanna go in a little closer?
- No, this is fine, Jenny’ll get scared.

327
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,555
Woo-wee!  Look at this crowd!

328
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:29,558
Bound to be a lot of pussy on the hunt
in a crowd like this!

329
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:31,560
...scroll up.

330
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,562
...like a frog.

331
00:52:33,562 --> 00:52:36,565
Where’d you figure the most pussies at?

332
00:52:36,565 --> 00:52:38,567
- Las Vegas?
- California.

333
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:42,571
...one town in Wyoming, I take Wyoming.

334
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:44,949
Hey, you might wanna keep it down.
I got two little girls here.

335
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,034
Fuck you.

336
00:53:05,594 --> 00:53:08,347
I don’t want any trouble,
but you need to shut yourself up.

337
00:53:08,764 --> 00:53:11,600
Listen to your old lady tonight.

338
00:53:14,603 --> 00:53:18,607
What about it? You wanna lose
about half your fuckin’ teeth?

339
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:22,570
It’s all right, buddy.
I’d sure rather not.

340
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:34,582
Here she comes, ladies and gentlemen!
Oh boy, look at her fly!

341
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:38,752
It’s Lureen Milton from right here in Childress, Texas.
Come on folks, she’s one of yours...

342
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:40,629
Let’s give her a big hand.

343
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:44,592
She’s cleared on two.
She’s around three.

344
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:46,677
Come on folks, help her home!

345
00:53:48,637 --> 00:53:50,639
Come on, come on!

346
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,142
And the time is...

347
00:53:53,225 --> 00:53:54,810
...sixteen and a half.

348
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:12,661
Ma’am.

349
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:44,235
Next up is a newcomer, Jack Twist,
all the way up from Lightning Flat, Wyoming.

350
00:55:04,672 --> 00:55:06,131
Let’s see what the judges say...

351
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:09,051
I tell you what.
That sure looked like a winnin’ ride to me.

352
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,948
You know that girl?

353
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,703
I sure do. That’s Lureen Newsome.
Dad sells farm equipment. Big farm equipment.

354
00:55:36,745 --> 00:55:40,708
$100,000 tractors,
shit like that.

355
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:57,433
What you waitin’ for cowboy? A mating call?

356
00:57:33,863 --> 00:57:35,865
Wait, hold on.

357
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:38,868
You don’t think I’m too fast, do you?

358
00:57:38,868 --> 00:57:41,871
Maybe we should put the brakes on?

359
00:57:41,871 --> 00:57:45,833
Fast or slow, I just like
the direction you’re goin’.

360
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:57,887
You are in a hurry!

361
00:57:57,887 --> 00:58:01,849
My daddy’s in a hurry.
Wants me home with the car by midnight.

362
00:58:14,904 --> 00:58:16,906
- Hey, Monroe.
- Hey, En.

363
00:58:16,906 --> 00:58:17,907
Is Alma here?

364
00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:19,074
Oh yes, she’s in the condiments aisle.

365
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:20,284
The what?

366
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:22,786
- Ketchup.
- Thanks.

367
00:58:26,332 --> 00:58:29,919
Hey honey! What are y’all doin’ here?

368
00:58:29,919 --> 00:58:31,545
I’m in a big hurry.

369
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:34,506
My boss called and, uh,
he wants me to go up the ranch.

370
00:58:34,924 --> 00:58:37,927
Seems all the heifers decided to calf at the same time.

371
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:39,929
I figured I could drop the girls off with you.

372
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:43,891
I got a million things I gotta do
before I leave.

373
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,602
I don’t get off for another three hours.

374
00:58:46,644 --> 00:58:48,646
Mama, I need to pee.
Not now, honey.

375
00:58:48,938 --> 00:58:51,941
Ennis, please, you promised
you’d take them tonight.

376
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:54,944
I can’t afford not to be there
when they have these calfs.

377
00:58:54,944 --> 00:58:56,946
I’ll lose my job if they lose any of ’em.

378
00:58:56,946 --> 00:58:59,490
And what about my job?

379
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:04,954
OK, all right.
Call my sister see if she can take ’em.

380
00:59:04,954 --> 00:59:06,956
All right, all right.

381
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:09,959
Be a good girl for mama, all right?

382
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:13,921
I’ll be half the night...

383
00:59:18,676 --> 00:59:19,969
Oh boy!

384
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,972
Monroe, I am so sorry!

385
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:24,974
It’s ok, it’s ok.

386
00:59:24,974 --> 00:59:28,978
I’ll clean this up, just as soon as
I call my sister to come get the girls.

387
00:59:28,978 --> 00:59:29,979
Really, Alma, it’s ok.

388
00:59:29,979 --> 00:59:31,981
- Forget it.
- Alma, come with me.

389
00:59:31,981 --> 00:59:32,982
Watch your feet.

390
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:35,150
Alma.

391
00:59:43,993 --> 00:59:47,997
I got two whole boxes of formula for you.

392
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:51,000
- 120 cans
- 120?

393
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,002
Dear, where’d you put ’em?

394
00:59:53,002 --> 00:59:54,753
Oh hell.  Back seat of the car where I left ’em.

395
00:59:57,464 --> 00:59:59,133
Rodeo can get ’em.

396
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:06,015
I can already see what little Bobby looks like.

397
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:09,977
Good job, little girl.
He’s the spittin’ image of his grandpa.

398
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,982
Isn’t he just the spitting image of his grandpa?

399
01:00:47,723 --> 01:00:49,183
Hey.

400
01:00:57,066 --> 01:01:00,653
Hey Ennis, you somebody name of Jack?

401
01:01:03,322 --> 01:01:04,323
Maybe. Why?

402
01:01:05,074 --> 01:01:08,202
’Cause you got a postcard that
come general delivery.

403
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:17,169
Friend, this letter is long over due.
Coming through on the 24th.
Drop me a line say if your there. Jack.

404
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:23,050
Is it somebody you cowboyed with, or what?

405
01:01:24,093 --> 01:01:26,095
No, Jack, he rodeos mostly.

406
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:32,059
We was fishin’ buddies.

407
01:02:19,148 --> 01:02:23,110
Maybe we could get a babysitter.

408
01:02:25,154 --> 01:02:27,615
Take your friend to the Knife and Fork...

409
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,159
Jack ain’t the restaurant type.

410
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:32,121
We’re more likely just...

411
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,421
...go out and get drunk.

412
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,675
If he shows.

413
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:44,224
Ok, we take one more bite then
we finish with dinner?

414
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,187
There, that’s a good bite.
All right, you’re excused.

415
01:03:12,252 --> 01:03:16,215
Jack fuckin’ Twist!

416
01:03:19,134 --> 01:03:20,886
You son-of-a-bitch.

417
01:04:28,078 --> 01:04:30,414
Alma, this is Jack Twist.

418
01:04:31,582 --> 01:04:33,751
Jack, this is my wife, Alma.

419
01:04:33,459 --> 01:04:34,960
- Howdy.
- Hello.

420
01:04:37,004 --> 01:04:39,798
- Oh, you got a kid.
- Yeah, I got two little girls.

421
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,801
- Alma Junior and Jenny.
- I got a boy.

422
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:47,111
- Yeah?
- 8 months old. Smiles a lot

423
01:04:48,223 --> 01:04:52,019
I married the prettiest little
gal in Childress, Texas. Lureen.

424
01:04:54,897 --> 01:04:56,857
So me and Jack, we’re gonna head out,
and get ourselves a drink.

425
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:01,153
- Sure enough
- Pleased to meet you, ma’am.

426
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:04,948
We might not get back tonight
when we get to drinkin’ and talkin’ and all.

427
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:07,242
Ennis?

428
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:09,328
Could you get me a pack of smokes?

429
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:12,456
If you need smokes there over there in the
top pocket of my blue shirt in the bedroom.

430
01:05:26,345 --> 01:05:29,473
- 4 years, damn!
- Yeah, 4 years.

431
01:05:32,726 --> 01:05:37,981
Didn’t think I’d hear from you again.
I figured you was sore from that punch.

432
01:05:38,649 --> 01:05:45,114
That next summer I drove back up to Brokeback.
Talked to Aguirre about a job.

433
01:05:45,197 --> 01:05:47,574
Told me you hadn’t been back
so I left

434
01:05:47,866 --> 01:05:53,163
Went down to Texas for rodeoin’.
And that’s how I met Lureen.

435
01:05:53,914 --> 01:05:57,334
Made $2,000 that year bullridin’.
Nearly starved.

436
01:05:59,294 --> 01:06:03,132
Lureen’s old man makes serious money.
Farm machine business. Of course he hates my guts though.

437
01:06:09,796 --> 01:06:13,116
- The army didn’t get you?
- Nope, too busted up.

438
01:06:13,196 --> 01:06:20,076
That rodeo ain’t what is was in my daddy’s day.
Got out while he could still walk.

439
01:06:20,107 --> 01:06:22,735
I swear to God, I didn’t know
we was gonna get into this again.

440
01:06:26,071 --> 01:06:30,242
Oh yes, I did. I red-lined it all the way,
I couldn’t get here fast enough.

441
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,786
What about you?

442
01:06:33,996 --> 01:06:35,289
Me?

443
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:40,627
I don’t know.

444
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:47,801
That Brokeback got us good, don’t it?

445
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:56,018
What are we gonna do now?

446
01:06:59,855 --> 01:07:03,567
My God, there’s nothin’ we can do.

447
01:07:06,653 --> 01:07:09,531
’Cause I’m stuck with what I got here.

448
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:16,914
Makin’ a livin’s about all I got time for, now.

449
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:41,563
Hey.

450
01:07:42,523 --> 01:07:44,942
Me and Jack’s headin’ out for
the mountains for a day or two.

451
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,860
Do ourselves a little fishin’.

452
01:07:54,827 --> 01:07:56,829
You know your friend could
come inside, have a cup of coffee.

453
01:07:58,038 --> 01:07:59,081
Oh, he’s from Texas.

454
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:02,543
Texans don’t drink coffee?

455
01:08:12,636 --> 01:08:14,680
You sure that forman won’t fire
you for takin’ off?

456
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:18,892
That foreman he owes me.
I worked through a blizzard last Christmas.

457
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:20,269
You remember that?

458
01:08:20,769 --> 01:08:22,563
Besides, I’ll only be a couple of days.

459
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:29,194
Bring fish, dad. Big, big ones.

460
01:08:44,418 --> 01:08:45,669
Come here.

461
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:51,008
See you Sunday at the latest.

462
01:09:00,893 --> 01:09:03,395
I’m starvin’. Wanna get something to eat?
- Yep.

463
01:09:32,925 --> 01:09:35,010
Last one in…

464
01:09:52,903 --> 01:09:54,863
Is there anything interesting
up there in Heaven?

465
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,533
I was just sending up
a prayer of thanks.

466
01:09:59,368 --> 01:10:00,536
For what?

467
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,707
For you forgettin’ to bring that harmonica!

468
01:10:05,165 --> 01:10:07,584
I’m enjoyin’ the peace and quiet.

469
01:10:12,089 --> 01:10:15,884
You know, it could be like this,
just like this, always.

470
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:18,137
Yeah?  How’d you figure that?

471
01:10:22,057 --> 01:10:25,019
What about if you and me had
a little ranch, somewhere?

472
01:10:26,854 --> 01:10:29,857
Little cow and calf operation?
It would be a sweet life.

473
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:35,154
Hell, Lureen’s old man, you bet he’d
give me a down payment to get lost.

474
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,531
He more or less already said it.

475
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:39,658
No, I…

476
01:10:42,327 --> 01:10:45,205
I told you, it ain’t gonna be that way.

477
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:53,422
Well, you got your wife and baby in Texas.

478
01:10:54,715 --> 01:10:57,760
You know, I got my life in Riverton.

479
01:10:58,177 --> 01:10:59,219
That so?

480
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,805
You and Alma, that’s a life?

481
01:11:02,056 --> 01:11:05,100
You shut up about Alma,
this ain’t her fault.

482
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:09,646
The bottom line is…

483
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:15,486
We’re around each other and
this thing grabs hold of us again…

484
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:18,072
...in the wrong place...

485
01:11:19,114 --> 01:11:20,741
...in the wrong time...

486
01:11:21,825 --> 01:11:23,327
...we’re dead.

487
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:27,331
I tell you…

488
01:11:27,456 --> 01:11:29,124
There were these two old guys

489
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:31,794
ranched up together, down home.

490
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:34,963
Earl and Ritch.

491
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:40,511
And they was the joke of town,
even though they were pretty tough old birds.

492
01:11:46,016 --> 01:11:51,730
Anyway, they found Earl dead
in an irrigation ditch.

493
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:54,525
They took a tire iron to him.

494
01:11:54,733 --> 01:11:58,946
Spurred him up, drug him around by his
dick till it pulled off.

495
01:12:01,448 --> 01:12:02,658
You seen this?

496
01:12:03,492 --> 01:12:05,369
Yeah, I was about 9 years old.

497
01:12:08,455 --> 01:12:11,709
My daddy, he made sure me and
my brother seen it.

498
01:12:16,046 --> 01:12:18,716
Hell, for all I know,
he done the job.

499
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:25,431
Two guys livin’ together?
No way.

500
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:31,020
We can get together once in a while.
Way the hell out in the middle of nowhere, but...

501
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:34,106
Once in a while?

502
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,276
Every 4 fuckin’ years?

503
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:41,864
If you can’t fix it, Jack,
you gotta stand it.

504
01:12:45,617 --> 01:12:46,952
For how long?

505
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,623
As long as we can ride it.

506
01:12:56,879 --> 01:12:58,756
There ain’t no reins on this one.

507
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:17,441
It’s nearly supper time, where in the hell
do you think you’re goin?

508
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:19,193
To work.

509
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:21,403
- Hell, I thought you got the day off.
- Well you thought wrong.

510
01:13:21,528 --> 01:13:23,864
- The girls need to be fed.
- Well you take care of it.

511
01:13:25,657 --> 01:13:26,241
Alma!

512
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,703
- Supper is on the stove!
- No-one’s eatin’ unless you’re servin’ it.

513
01:13:29,953 --> 01:13:32,581
I already promised I’d take the extra shift.

514
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:34,375
Fuckin’ tell ’em you made a mistake, then.

515
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,335
Goddamit, Alma!

516
01:13:37,169 --> 01:13:38,170
Alma!

517
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:51,392
- You girls need a push or somethin’?
- No.

518
01:14:00,442 --> 01:14:03,612
This is the hard part, gentlemen.
You’re not gonna get that with your Caddy.

519
01:14:03,821 --> 01:14:06,532
I told yous you could do it,
now I’m gonna show you.

520
01:14:10,285 --> 01:14:17,626
- Say, ain’t that piss-ant used to ridin’ bulls?
- He used to try!

521
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:44,194
Ennis, see you in a couple weeks,
fish should be jumpin’. Jack.

522
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:51,744
Honey...

523
01:14:51,827 --> 01:14:53,120
Have you seen my blue Parka?

524
01:14:54,038 --> 01:14:55,581
Um, last time I seen it you was in it.

525
01:14:55,998 --> 01:14:57,291
Day we had that big ice storm.

526
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:00,878
Well, coulda sworn I seen it here.

527
01:15:05,424 --> 01:15:07,926
You know, you been goin’ up to Wyoming
all these years…

528
01:15:08,052 --> 01:15:10,012
Why can’t your buddy come down here
to Texas and fish?

529
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:12,765
’Cause the Big Horn Mountains ain’t in Texas.

530
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,726
And I don’t think his pick-up could
make it down here anyway.

531
01:15:16,727 --> 01:15:18,729
A new model comin’ in this week, remember?

532
01:15:19,855 --> 01:15:21,690
You the best combine salesman we got.

533
01:15:22,941 --> 01:15:25,152
You’re the only combine salesman, in fact.

534
01:15:25,486 --> 01:15:27,863
Yeah, well, I’ll be back in a week.
That is unless I freeze to death.

535
01:15:28,072 --> 01:15:29,531
And I’ll freeze if I don’t find that Parka!

536
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:31,909
Well, I don’t have the Goddam Parka!

537
01:15:32,034 --> 01:15:34,370
You know you’re worse than Bobby
when it comes to losin’ stuff.

538
01:15:34,703 --> 01:15:37,956
Speakin’ of Bobby, did you call
his school about gettin’ him a tutor?

539
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:42,211
- I thought you were gonna call.
- I complain too much.

540
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:44,588
The teacher don’t like me.
Now it’s your turn.

541
01:15:44,636 --> 01:15:47,424
Ok, fine, so I’ll call later.

542
01:15:50,036 --> 01:15:51,904
All right, fine.

543
01:15:52,638 --> 01:15:53,472
Bye.

544
01:15:54,848 --> 01:15:59,144
- I got 14 hours of drivin’ ahead of me.
- See now, it don’t seem fair.

545
01:15:59,395 --> 01:16:02,815
You goin’ up there two or three times a year
him never comin’ down here…

546
01:16:19,623 --> 01:16:23,711
Ennis, they got an openin’ at the power
company, might be good pay.

547
01:16:23,752 --> 01:16:27,506
Well, if they’re as clumsy as I am,
probably get electrocuted.

548
01:16:27,589 --> 01:16:29,633
Hey daddy!  The church picnic’s next weekend.

549
01:16:29,883 --> 01:16:31,844
Will you be back from fishin’
by next weekend?

550
01:16:32,052 --> 01:16:33,220
Please, daddy, please!

551
01:16:33,429 --> 01:16:35,681
All right, as long as
I don’t have to sing.

552
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:40,769
You forgettin’ somethin’?

553
01:17:18,932 --> 01:17:19,850
You’re late!

554
01:17:41,121 --> 01:17:44,291
Here we go. No hands!

555
01:17:52,549 --> 01:17:53,759
Come on... Come on...

556
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:12,820
It’s Saturday night. You know we could still
smarten up and head on over to the church social.

557
01:18:14,071 --> 01:18:16,448
That fire and brimstone crap?

558
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:21,036
I think it’d be nice.

559
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:43,267
Ennis, as far behind as we are in the bills,
makes me nervous not to take no precaution.

560
01:18:46,645 --> 01:18:50,899
If you don’t want no more of my kids
I’d be happy to leave you alone.

561
01:18:55,237 --> 01:18:58,115
I’d have ’em, if you’d support ’em.

562
01:19:15,799 --> 01:19:20,596
Custody of the two minor children, Alma Del Mar Jr.
and Jennifer Del Mar is awarded to plaintiff.

563
01:19:21,513 --> 01:19:26,310
Defendant is ordered to pay child support
to plaintiff in the sum of $125…

564
01:19:26,435 --> 01:19:31,398
per month, for each of the minor children
until they reach the age of 18 years.

565
01:19:31,523 --> 01:19:35,611
Del Mar divorce granted,
this 6th day of November, 1975.

566
01:19:39,782 --> 01:19:44,912
ENTERING WYOMING

567
01:20:09,478 --> 01:20:10,396
What are you doin’ here, huh?

568
01:20:12,856 --> 01:20:14,692
Got your message about the divorce.

569
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:17,653
Come here.

570
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:23,951
This here’s Jack, Jack these are my little girls.
This here’s Alma Jr. and Jenny.

571
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:25,327
Hey.

572
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:27,413
- Say hi, girls.
- Hi.

573
01:20:34,378 --> 01:20:36,755
I got your card the divorce came through.

574
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:39,800
So, here I am.

575
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:44,096
I had to ask about 10 different people
in Riverton where you’d moved to.

576
01:20:49,935 --> 01:20:53,796
I guess, I thought that this means you...

577
01:20:53,836 --> 01:20:59,611
No... Jack, I...
I don’t know what to say.

578
01:21:01,989 --> 01:21:04,366
See, I got the girls this weekend, and...

579
01:21:05,617 --> 01:21:09,246
I’m sure as hell sorry.

580
01:21:09,747 --> 01:21:10,748
You know I am.

581
01:21:12,207 --> 01:21:19,423
See, I only get ’em once and month and I missed
last month, so I just… because of the round up...

582
01:21:20,466 --> 01:21:26,138
- So, uh… well,...
- Yeah, all right.

583
01:21:30,684 --> 01:21:33,729
- Jack…
- Well, I’ll see you next month, then.

584
01:23:29,094 --> 01:23:29,762
Here we go.

585
01:23:30,929 --> 01:23:32,306
Here we are!

586
01:23:36,935 --> 01:23:40,230
Hold up there, Rodeo.
Stud duck do the carvin’ around here.

587
01:23:41,148 --> 01:23:45,402
You bet, LD, I was just…
savin’ you the trouble.

588
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:56,455
Bobby, if you don’t eat your dinner
I’m gonna have to turn off that television.

589
01:23:56,747 --> 01:24:00,209
Why mama?  I’m gonna be eating
this food for the next two weeks.

590
01:24:00,459 --> 01:24:02,002
Hey, you heard your mama.

591
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:07,508
You can finish your meal,
and then you can watch the game.

592
01:24:20,312 --> 01:24:21,271
Daddy...

593
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:25,275
Daddy!

594
01:24:27,361 --> 01:24:29,863
Hell, we don’t eat with our eyes!

595
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,409
You want the boy to grow up
to be a man, don’t you, Dolly?

596
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:35,911
Boys should watch football.

597
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:47,381
Like Hell.  He’s gonna finishe eatin’ a meal
that his mama too three hours fixin’.

598
01:24:57,933 --> 01:24:59,893
You sit down,
you old son-of-a-bitch!

599
01:25:03,355 --> 01:25:07,317
This is my house, this is my child
and you are my guest.

600
01:25:07,568 --> 01:25:10,904
Now you sit down before I knock
your ignorant ass into next week.

601
01:26:02,498 --> 01:26:05,793
Daddy, tell about when
you rode broncs in the rodeo.

602
01:26:08,087 --> 01:26:12,758
Well, that’s a short story honey,
it was only about 3 seconds I was on that bronc.

603
01:26:14,635 --> 01:26:17,137
Next thing I knew,
I was flyin’ through the air.

604
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:20,724
Only I was no angel
like you and Jenny, here.

605
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,602
I didn’t have no wings.

606
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:28,857
And that’s the story of my saddle bronc career.

607
01:26:52,798 --> 01:26:53,757
There you go.

608
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:02,850
You oughta get married again, Ennis.

609
01:27:03,142 --> 01:27:05,602
Me and the girls worry about you
bein’ alone so much.

610
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:09,231
Hm… Well, once burned…

611
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:15,612
You still go fishin’ with Jack Twist?

612
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:19,825
Not often.

613
01:27:23,829 --> 01:27:26,540
I used to wonder how come
you never brought any trouts home.

614
01:27:27,499 --> 01:27:28,709
You always said you caught plenty,…

615
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,712
…and you know how me and the girls like fish.

616
01:27:34,256 --> 01:27:39,428
So one night I got your crail case open,
night before you went on one of your little trips.

617
01:27:41,388 --> 01:27:43,640
Price tag still on after five years.

618
01:27:45,267 --> 01:27:46,977
And I tied a note to the end of the line.

619
01:27:49,772 --> 01:27:53,067
It said, “Hello Ennis. Bring some
fish home. Love Alma."

620
01:27:53,442 --> 01:27:58,947
And then you come back, lookin’ all perky.
Said you caught a bunch of brown ones
and you ate ’em all up.

621
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,033
D’you remember?

622
01:28:03,702 --> 01:28:09,041
I looked in that case first chance I got
and there’s my note still tied there.
That line hadn’t touched water in its life.

623
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:10,501
It don’t mean nothin’, Alma.

624
01:28:10,834 --> 01:28:14,463
Don’t try and fool me no more, Ennis.
I know what it means.

625
01:28:15,881 --> 01:28:16,590
Jack Twist?

626
01:28:20,177 --> 01:28:24,098
Jack Nasty.
You didn’t go up there to fish, you…

627
01:28:24,306 --> 01:28:26,642
Now you listen to me.
You don’t know nothin’ about it.

628
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:28,977
I’m gonna yell for Monroe.

629
01:28:31,063 --> 01:28:32,981
You tell him, I’ll make you eat the fuckin’ floor.
- Get out!

630
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:36,527
Get out of my house!

631
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:39,780
Daddy!

632
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:42,908
Alma!

633
01:28:45,202 --> 01:28:46,161
Bye, Daddy.

634
01:28:48,205 --> 01:28:49,081
Bye!.

635
01:29:03,887 --> 01:29:05,723
Hey asshole, watch where you’re goin’!

636
01:29:13,355 --> 01:29:15,691
You stupid fucker!

637
01:29:19,361 --> 01:29:21,155
Goddam…

638
01:30:23,634 --> 01:30:26,011
... what I’m sayin’ is, if the tax don’t get you,
the inflation will eat it all up.

639
01:30:31,475 --> 01:30:34,937
If you’d see Lureen, punchin’
numbers in her addin’ machine.

640
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:38,774
She’s gonna crack the zeros.
Her eyes gettin’ smaller and smaller.

641
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:44,655
Like watchin’ a rabbit tryin’ to squeeze
into a snakehole with a coyote on its tail.

642
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:47,116
That’s some high-class entertainment
if you ask me.

643
01:30:49,451 --> 01:30:50,494
For what it’s worth.

644
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:58,293
You and Lureen, it’s normal an’ all?

645
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:02,006
Sure.

646
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:06,385
She don’t ever suspect?

647
01:31:17,146 --> 01:31:18,647
You ever get the feelin’...

648
01:31:19,565 --> 01:31:20,733
...I don’t know...

649
01:31:21,942 --> 01:31:27,489
…when you’re in town and someone looks at ya?
Suspicious?

650
01:31:27,948 --> 01:31:29,283
Like he knows.

651
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:33,871
And then you go out on the pavement and
everyone’s lookin’ at ya like they all know, too?

652
01:31:40,669 --> 01:31:42,880
Maybe you oughta get out of there, you know?

653
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:48,010
Find yourself some place different,
maybe Texas.

654
01:31:52,765 --> 01:31:54,808
Texas?  Sure, and maybe you can convince Alma
to let you and Lureen adopt the girls.

655
01:31:54,933 --> 01:31:58,520
And we can just live together,
herdin’ sheep.

656
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:04,068
And it’ll rain money from LD Newsome, and
whisky’ll flow in the stream, Jack, that’s real smart.

657
01:32:05,861 --> 01:32:08,530
Oh hell. You wanna live your miserable fuckin’
life, go right ahead

658
01:32:08,655 --> 01:32:11,784
- I was just thinkin’ out loud.
- Yeah, you’re a real thinker, there.

659
01:32:12,117 --> 01:32:16,538
Goddam.  Jack fuckin’ Twist.
Got it all figured out, ain’t ya?

660
01:32:39,269 --> 01:32:40,854
Just finished my shift.
Wanna dance?

661
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:42,648
Well, I was on my way to…

662
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:48,821
- I’m Cassie, Cassie Farrah.
- Ennis. Del Mar.

663
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:19,727
No more dancin’ for me, I hope.

664
01:33:21,437 --> 01:33:23,939
You’re safe.
My feet hurt.

665
01:33:24,356 --> 01:33:25,607
It’s hard work, is it?

666
01:33:25,816 --> 01:33:26,442
Yeah!

667
01:33:26,483 --> 01:33:29,194
Drunks like you, demandin’ beer after beer,
smokin’...

668
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,072
Gets tiresome.

669
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:36,327
What do you do, Ennis Del Mar?

670
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,873
Well, earlier today I castrated a calf.

671
01:33:46,462 --> 01:33:47,338
What are you doin’?

672
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:50,591
Tryin’ to get a foot rub, dummy.

673
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:55,429
All right.

674
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:58,974
That good?

675
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:26,794
…then I pledged Tri-Delt at SMU.
And I sure never thought I’d end up in
a pokey little place like Childress.

676
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,423
Then I met old Randall here at an Aggie game
and he was an animal husbandry major .

677
01:34:31,507 --> 01:34:36,720
So we been here for a month, and he got the
foreman job over at Roy Taylor’s ranch.

678
01:34:36,929 --> 01:34:38,597
Like it or not, here I am.

679
01:34:39,098 --> 01:34:41,934
Was you Tri-Delt?  I was Kappa Phi myself.

680
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:45,938
Well, even though we ain’t quite sorority sisters,

681
01:34:46,105 --> 01:34:49,149
we might have to dance with ourselves, Lureen!

682
01:34:49,441 --> 01:34:51,735
Our husbands ain’t the least bit
interested in dancin’!

683
01:34:51,985 --> 01:34:54,863
- They ain’t got a smidgen of rhythm between ’em.
- It’s funny, isn’t it!

684
01:34:55,614 --> 01:34:59,910
Husbands don’t never seem to want
to dance with their wives.

685
01:35:01,203 --> 01:35:04,123
- Why do you think that is, Jack?
- I never gave that theory any thought.

686
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:10,087
- Wanna dance?
- Yes!  Thank you.

687
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,297
- Do you mind?
- No, no problem.

688
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:20,305
That’s very nice.  Thank you for asking me
to dance with you. I appreciate that.
Randall never does.

689
01:35:23,642 --> 01:35:28,480
It’s a good thing you and Lureen happened along
when you did, otherwise we’d still be stuck on the
side of the road in that there pick-up.

690
01:35:29,064 --> 01:35:34,194
I told Randall we oughta take the car,
of course he’d never listen to me!

691
01:35:34,236 --> 01:35:34,528
He wouldn’t listen to me if
he was goin’ deaf tomorrow!

692
01:35:34,486 --> 01:35:38,991
I told him it’d take more than chewin’ gum
and bailin’ wire to fix that there pick-up.

693
01:35:39,783 --> 01:35:42,119
Well, he’s never been very mechanical, though.

694
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:56,508
You ever notice how a woman’ll powder her nose
before she goes to a party.

695
01:35:57,176 --> 01:35:59,720
Then she’ll powder it again
once the party’s over?

696
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,640
Why powder your nose just
to go home and go to bed?

697
01:36:04,516 --> 01:36:06,185
I don’t know.

698
01:36:07,144 --> 01:36:10,564
Even if I wanted to know, I couldn’t get
a word in with Lashawn long enough to ask!

699
01:36:11,815 --> 01:36:15,235
- That woman talks a blue streak.
- A lively little gal.

700
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:24,995
You’ll like workin’ for Roy Taylor.

701
01:36:25,287 --> 01:36:27,956
- He’s solid.
- Oh yeah, Roy, he’s a good old boy.

702
01:36:34,004 --> 01:36:37,800
He’s got a little cabin, down on Lake Camp.

703
01:36:38,217 --> 01:36:42,304
Got a crop house, a little boat.
Said I could use it whenever I want.

704
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:49,728
We oughta go down there some weekend.

705
01:36:50,813 --> 01:36:57,820
Drink a little whisky, fish some,
get away, you know?

706
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:05,494
When I was right out of SMU I coulda had
my pick of pretty much any job in North Dallas.

707
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:09,581
So my pick was Neiman Marcus,
which was a disaster, ’cause honey,
where clothes is concerned, I got no resistence.

708
01:37:09,748 --> 01:37:12,501
I was spendin’ more than I made,
more than Randall ever will make!

709
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:17,381
We come out here thinking ranchin’ was still
big hats and Marlboros.
Boy was we behind the times!

710
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:38,986
Hey there, Junior?
You ready?

711
01:37:52,624 --> 01:37:54,376
What do you think?

712
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:59,798
- Your daddy ever see fit to settle down again?
- I don’t know.

713
01:38:00,924 --> 01:38:02,885
Maybe he’s not the marryin’ kind.

714
01:38:06,096 --> 01:38:10,976
You don’t think so?
Or you don’t think I’m the one for him?

715
01:38:13,896 --> 01:38:15,356
You’re good enough.

716
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:22,655
You don’t say much but
you get your point across.

717
01:38:25,324 --> 01:38:27,576
Sorry, didn’t mean to be rude.

718
01:38:30,913 --> 01:38:31,747
Hi.

719
01:38:32,665 --> 01:38:35,334
You’re stayin’ on your feet, cowboy.

720
01:38:37,127 --> 01:38:38,420
Excuse me darlin’.

721
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:04,321
So I’ll pick you and Jenny up
next weekend, after church.

722
01:39:06,365 --> 01:39:07,157
Fine.

723
01:39:11,078 --> 01:39:14,581
- You all right?
- Yes.

724
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,043
Are you sure?

725
01:39:20,546 --> 01:39:21,880
Daddy, I was thinkin’...

726
01:39:22,464 --> 01:39:25,843
Well, with a new baby and all,
mom and Monroe are bein’ awful strict on me.

727
01:39:26,468 --> 01:39:28,303
More on me than Jenny, even.

728
01:39:28,846 --> 01:39:31,974
I was thinkin’, maybe I could...

729
01:39:33,934 --> 01:39:35,769
maybe I could come and stay with you.

730
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:40,315
I’d be an awful good help,
I know I would.

731
01:39:42,192 --> 01:39:43,819
Well, I...
You know I ain’t set up for that.

732
01:39:45,654 --> 01:39:49,575
With the round-up comin’,
I won’t ever be home.

733
01:39:51,702 --> 01:39:52,953
It’s all right, daddy.

734
01:39:53,162 --> 01:39:55,956
- Well, you know, I’m not sayin’ I wouldn’t...
- It’s all right, I understand.

735
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:01,462
All right, well, I’ll see you on Sunday, then.

736
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:04,840
Bye.

737
01:40:07,217 --> 01:40:08,552
Bye, sweetheart.

738
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:40,250
Gonna snow tonight for sure.

739
01:40:41,251 --> 01:40:42,086
Yep.

740
01:40:50,594 --> 01:40:52,680
All this time, you ain’t found
nobody else to marry?

741
01:40:55,808 --> 01:40:59,269
I been puttin’ the blocks to a good lookin’
little gal over in Riverton.

742
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:04,775
A waitress, want’s to go
to nursin’ school or somethin’.

743
01:41:08,779 --> 01:41:10,447
I don’t know.

744
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:14,451
What about you and Lureen?

745
01:41:17,788 --> 01:41:20,624
Lureen’s good at making hard deals
in the machinery business.

746
01:41:20,791 --> 01:41:22,334
But as far as our marriage goes…

747
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:25,212
... we could do it over the phone.

748
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:41,103
Kinda got this thing goin’
with the ranch foreman’s wife over in Childress.

749
01:41:41,311 --> 01:41:47,067
I’m scared I’ll get shot by Lureen or her husband
each time I slip off to see her.

750
01:41:48,652 --> 01:41:49,695
Well, you probably deserve it.

751
01:41:57,745 --> 01:41:59,121
Tell you what...

752
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:06,003
The truth is...

753
01:42:12,843 --> 01:42:15,387
Sometimes I miss you so much
I can hardly stand it.

754
01:42:58,555 --> 01:43:01,141
I guess I’ll head on up to Lightning Flat.

755
01:43:02,559 --> 01:43:03,811
See the folks for a day or two.

756
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:12,611
There is somethin’ I been meanin’ to tell you, bud.

757
01:43:18,242 --> 01:43:20,911
Well, it’s likely November before
I can come out here again.

758
01:43:24,456 --> 01:43:31,130
After we shift stock and afore winter
feedin’ starts again.

759
01:43:33,298 --> 01:43:34,299
November...

760
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:40,139
Well, what in the hell ever
happened to August?

761
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:47,312
Christ, Ennis.

762
01:43:53,694 --> 01:43:55,779
You know had a fuckin’ week to say
some kinda word about this.

763
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:02,202
Why is it we’re always in the friggin’ cold?

764
01:44:02,494 --> 01:44:05,539
We oughta go south, where it’s warm.

765
01:44:05,706 --> 01:44:06,749
You know, we oughta go to Mexico.

766
01:44:08,459 --> 01:44:09,209
Mexico?

767
01:44:11,128 --> 01:44:16,675
Hell Jack, you know me.  About the only
travellin’ I ever done is around a
coffee pot lookin’ for the handle.

768
01:44:19,094 --> 01:44:20,721
Come on Jack, lighten up on me.

769
01:44:23,474 --> 01:44:24,516
We can hunt in November.

770
01:44:26,268 --> 01:44:27,853
Kill us a nice elk.

771
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:35,027
I’ll try if I can get Don Wroe’s cabin again.
We had a good time that year, didn’t we?

772
01:44:37,613 --> 01:44:39,573
There ain’t never enough time, never enough.

773
01:44:44,995 --> 01:44:45,913
You know, friend...

774
01:44:47,623 --> 01:44:50,626
This is a Goddam bitch of
an unsatisfactory situation.

775
01:44:52,336 --> 01:44:54,922
You used to come away easy,
and now it’s like seein’ the Pope.

776
01:44:58,926 --> 01:45:00,052
Jack, I gotta work, huh?

777
01:45:03,847 --> 01:45:06,100
I mean, in them earlier days I’d just quit the job.

778
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:10,437
Well you…

779
01:45:11,563 --> 01:45:13,732
You forget what it’s like bein’ broke all the time.

780
01:45:18,529 --> 01:45:20,906
You ever hear of child support?

781
01:45:24,368 --> 01:45:27,913
I tell you this.  I can’t quit this one,
and I can’t get the time off.

782
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:36,922
It’s hard enough gettin’ this time.
The trade-off is August.

783
01:45:40,843 --> 01:45:42,636
You got a better idea?

784
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,557
I did once.

785
01:45:49,184 --> 01:45:50,310
You did once.

786
01:45:55,107 --> 01:45:58,110
Have you been in Mexico, Jack Twist?

787
01:46:00,362 --> 01:46:03,490
’Cause I hear what they got in Mexico
for boys like you.

788
01:46:05,784 --> 01:46:08,329
Hell yes, I’ve been in Mexico.
Is that a fuckin’ problem?

789
01:46:17,463 --> 01:46:22,801
I’m gonna tell you this one time,
Jack fuckin’ Twist. And I ain’t foolin’.

790
01:46:23,802 --> 01:46:27,264
What I don’t know,
all them things that I don’t know,

791
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:30,267
I’d get you killed if I come to know them.

792
01:46:35,272 --> 01:46:36,940
I ain’t jokin’.

793
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:44,281
Well try this one,
and I’ll say it just once.

794
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:45,407
Go ahead.

795
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:49,328
I tell you what.  We could had a good life
together, fuckin’ real good life.

796
01:46:49,536 --> 01:46:53,791
Had us a place of our own.
But you didn’t want it, Ennis.

797
01:46:54,291 --> 01:46:57,419
So what we got now is Brokeback Mountain.

798
01:46:59,755 --> 01:47:02,341
Everything’s built on that.
That’s all we got, boy, fuckin’ all.

799
01:47:02,383 --> 01:47:05,302
So I hope you know that
if you don’t never know the rest.

800
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:10,683
You count the damn few times that we have
been together in nearly 20 years…

801
01:47:10,849 --> 01:47:13,727
and you measure the short fuckin’ leash you keep
me on, and then you ask me about Mexico.

802
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:17,898
And then you tell me you kill me for needin’
something that I don’t hardly never get.

803
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:23,696
You have no idea how bad it gets.

804
01:47:27,324 --> 01:47:28,993
And I’m not you, I can’t ...

805
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:32,705
... make it on a couple of high-altitude fucks
once or twice a year.

806
01:47:36,542 --> 01:47:38,961
You are too much for me, Ennis.

807
01:47:39,294 --> 01:47:40,838
Son of a horsin’ bitch.

808
01:47:43,757 --> 01:47:45,467
I wish I knew how to quit you.

809
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:50,097
Well why don’t you?

810
01:47:53,392 --> 01:47:55,227
Why don’t you just let me be, huh?

811
01:47:57,938 --> 01:47:59,898
It’s because of you, Jack, that I’m like this.

812
01:48:04,695 --> 01:48:08,657
I’m nothin... I’m nowhere...

813
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:15,164
Get the fuck off me!

814
01:48:22,755 --> 01:48:27,134
Shh, shh, it’s all right, it’s all right.
Damn you, Ennis.

815
01:48:29,178 --> 01:48:30,888
I can’t stand this any more, Jack.

816
01:48:42,232 --> 01:48:44,109
And now you’re sleepin’ on your feet like a horse.

817
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:50,745
My mom used to say that to me when I was little.

818
01:48:51,758 --> 01:48:54,124
And sing…

819
01:49:07,383 --> 01:49:08,509
I gotta go.

820
01:49:11,804 --> 01:49:13,472
See you in the mornin’.

821
01:50:08,694 --> 01:50:10,154
Excuse me.

822
01:50:16,201 --> 01:50:18,620
Hey, Ennis Del Mar.

823
01:50:22,291 --> 01:50:23,709
Where you been?

824
01:50:25,961 --> 01:50:27,171
Here and there.

825
01:50:30,215 --> 01:50:37,014
I left word for you, with Steve, at the ranch.
But you musta got those notes I left at your place.

826
01:50:40,642 --> 01:50:43,395
Looks like I got the message in any case.

827
01:50:46,273 --> 01:50:47,816
Carl?

828
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:53,322
Yeah, Carl’s nice.
He even talks.

829
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:00,663
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

830
01:51:04,291 --> 01:51:06,126
Good for me.

831
01:51:12,758 --> 01:51:14,551
I don’t get you, Ennis Del Mar.

832
01:51:20,516 --> 01:51:21,517
I’m sorry.

833
01:51:29,858 --> 01:51:32,486
I was probably no fun anyways, was I?

834
01:51:36,115 --> 01:51:38,826
Ennis, girls don’t fall in love with fun.

835
01:52:13,235 --> 01:52:18,157
Jack, how about November 7 for you? I can meet
you at pine creek. Ennis Del Mar
(DECEASED)

836
01:52:21,785 --> 01:52:22,536
Hello.

837
01:52:23,329 --> 01:52:28,792
- Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.
- Who?

838
01:52:29,877 --> 01:52:32,629
- Who is this?
- Ennis Del Mar.

839
01:52:33,255 --> 01:52:34,548
An old buddy of Jack’s.

840
01:52:35,841 --> 01:52:39,553
Jack used to mention you.
You’re the fishin’ buddy…

841
01:52:39,845 --> 01:52:41,180
…or the huntin’ buddy, I know that.

842
01:52:42,598 --> 01:52:46,977
Woulda let you know what happened, but
I wasn’t sure about your name or address.

843
01:52:47,603 --> 01:52:49,813
Jack kept his friends’ addresses in his head.

844
01:52:51,649 --> 01:52:54,610
That’s what I’m callin’,
is to see what happened.

845
01:52:57,237 --> 01:52:58,697
Oh yeah.

846
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:06,955
Jack was pumpin’ up a flat on the truck
out on the back road when the tyre blew up.

847
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:10,793
The rim of the tyre slammed into his face
broke his nose and jaw...

848
01:53:11,043 --> 01:53:13,545
...and knocked him unconscious on his back.

849
01:53:15,214 --> 01:53:18,175
By the time somebody come along
he had drowned in his own blood.

850
01:53:19,885 --> 01:53:21,762
He was only 39 years old.

851
01:53:26,517 --> 01:53:27,226
Hello?

852
01:53:28,519 --> 01:53:29,353
Hello?

853
01:53:30,229 --> 01:53:31,271
Hello!

854
01:53:34,858 --> 01:53:39,029
- Was he buried down there?
- We put a stone up.

855
01:53:39,738 --> 01:53:43,200
He was cremated, like he wanted.
Half his ashes was interred here,…

856
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:45,911
...the rest was sent up with his folks.

857
01:53:47,246 --> 01:53:50,833
He used to say he wanted his ashes
scattered on Brokeback Mountain.

858
01:53:51,417 --> 01:53:53,752
But I wasn’t sure where that was.

859
01:53:54,503 --> 01:53:56,588
Thought Brokeback Mountain mighta
been around where he grew up.

860
01:53:57,673 --> 01:54:00,634
Knowin’ Jack, it might be some pretend place…

861
01:54:00,926 --> 01:54:04,471
where bluebirds sing,
and there’s a whisky spring.

862
01:54:08,225 --> 01:54:13,313
Well, ma’am, we was herdin’ sheep
on Brokeback one summer.

863
01:54:14,273 --> 01:54:15,441
Back in 1963.

864
01:54:24,658 --> 01:54:27,202
Well, he said it was his favourite place.

865
01:54:29,163 --> 01:54:31,957
I thought it meant to get drunk.
He drank a lot.

866
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:37,963
Is his folks still up in Lightning Flat?

867
01:54:39,465 --> 01:54:41,550
They’ll be there till the day they die.

868
01:54:46,847 --> 01:54:47,973
Thank you for your time.

869
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:53,854
I sure am sorry.
We was good friends.

870
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:05,449
Get in touch with his folks.
I suppose they’d appreciate it,…

871
01:55:05,574 --> 01:55:08,786
if his wishes was carried out.

872
01:55:08,827 --> 01:55:10,913
About the ashes, I mean.

873
01:56:12,391 --> 01:56:15,352
- Want a cup of coffee, don’t ya?
Piece of cherry cake?

874
01:56:15,436 --> 01:56:20,983
Yes ma’am, I’ll have a cup of coffee,
but I can’t eat no cake just now.  Thank you.

875
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,744
I feel awful bad about Jack.

876
01:56:34,413 --> 01:56:35,289
Thank you.

877
01:56:37,458 --> 01:56:39,126
I can’t begin to tell you
how bad I feel.

878
01:56:43,255 --> 01:56:44,423
I knew him a long time.

879
01:56:48,093 --> 01:56:52,848
I come by to say... if you want me to take
his ashes up there on Brokeback...

880
01:56:54,933 --> 01:56:56,477
...like his wife said he wanted to,…

881
01:56:58,312 --> 01:56:59,938
...then I’d be happy to.

882
01:57:03,275 --> 01:57:04,443
Tell you what.

883
01:57:05,903 --> 01:57:08,072
I know where Brokeback Mountain is.

884
01:57:09,365 --> 01:57:13,494
Thought he was too Goddam special
to be buried in the family plot.

885
01:57:17,247 --> 01:57:18,290
Jack used to say,…

886
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:21,502
"Ennis Del Mar," he used to say,

887
01:57:24,088 --> 01:57:30,761
"I’m gonna bring him up here one of these days,
and we’ll lick this damn ranch into shape."

888
01:57:32,388 --> 01:57:35,891
He had some half-baked notion the two
of you was gonna move up here,

889
01:57:37,559 --> 01:57:39,061
...build a cabin,...

890
01:57:39,978 --> 01:57:42,648
...help run the place.

891
01:57:44,483 --> 01:57:48,696
Then this spring...

892
01:57:48,737 --> 01:57:52,825
...he got another fella gonna
come up here with him.

893
01:57:53,534 --> 01:57:56,203
Build the place, help run the ranch.

894
01:57:57,705 --> 01:58:01,875
Some ranch neighbour of his
from down in Texas.

895
01:58:04,294 --> 01:58:08,132
Gonna split up with his wife
and come back here.

896
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,426
So he says.

897
01:58:11,468 --> 01:58:13,929
But like most of Jack’s ideas ...

898
01:58:15,514 --> 01:58:18,559
it never come to pass.

899
01:58:20,978 --> 01:58:24,398
I kept his room like it was when he was a boy.

900
01:58:25,941 --> 01:58:27,401
I think he appreciated that.

901
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:35,492
You are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want.

902
01:58:41,081 --> 01:58:42,958
Yeah, I’d like that, thank you.

903
02:01:45,391 --> 02:01:46,642
Tell you what...

904
02:01:48,644 --> 02:01:52,690
We got a family plot.
He’s goin’ in it.

905
02:01:55,234 --> 02:01:57,695
Yes, sir.

906
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:01,031
You’ll come back and see us again.

907
02:03:15,648 --> 02:03:18,025
- Hey there, Junior.
- Hey, daddy.

908
02:03:30,245 --> 02:03:34,249
- Like the car?
- Yeah, is it yours?

909
02:03:34,792 --> 02:03:35,793
It’s Kurt’s.

910
02:03:36,168 --> 02:03:41,423
- Well, I thought you was seein’, uh, Troy?
- Troy?  Daddy that was 2 years ago.

911
02:03:43,676 --> 02:03:47,513
- Troy still playin’ baseball?
- I don’t know what he’s doin’.

912
02:03:47,721 --> 02:03:49,431
I’m seein’ Kurt, now.

913
02:03:49,932 --> 02:03:53,143
- Well, what does Kurt do?
- Works out on the oil fields.

914
02:03:54,937 --> 02:03:58,065
- So he’s a roughneck, huh?
- Yeah.

915
02:03:59,108 --> 02:04:01,402
I guess you’re 19, you can do
whatever you want, is that right?

916
02:04:02,277 --> 02:04:03,445
Sure.

917
02:04:12,496 --> 02:04:14,999
- Daddy, you need more furniture.

918
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,460
Yeah, well, you got nothin',
you don’t need nothin’.

919
02:04:23,716 --> 02:04:25,217
So, what’s the occasion?

920
02:04:30,139 --> 02:04:32,266
Me and Kurt.

921
02:04:32,307 --> 02:04:33,559
We’re gettin’ married.

922
02:04:39,773 --> 02:04:43,027
- Well, how long you known this guy for?
- About a year.

923
02:04:45,946 --> 02:04:49,116
The wedding’ll be June 5th
at the Methodist church.

924
02:04:49,158 --> 02:04:50,659
Jenny’ll be singin’,...

925
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:53,078
and Monroe’s gonna cater the reception.

926
02:04:59,668 --> 02:05:01,879
Now this Kurt fella...

927
02:05:04,256 --> 02:05:05,549
He loves you?

928
02:05:08,218 --> 02:05:12,139
Yeah, daddy, he loves me.

929
02:05:20,856 --> 02:05:22,691
Was hopin’ you’d be there.

930
02:05:29,948 --> 02:05:35,621
I think I’m supposed to be on the round-up
down near the Tetons.

931
02:05:55,432 --> 02:05:56,475
You know what?...

932
02:05:58,310 --> 02:06:01,563
I reckon they can find themselves a new cowboy.

933
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:07,653
My little girl is getting married.

934
02:06:20,374 --> 02:06:21,834
To Alma and Kurt.

935
02:07:42,956 --> 02:07:45,042
Jack, I swear.

936
