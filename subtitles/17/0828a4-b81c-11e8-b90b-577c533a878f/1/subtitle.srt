00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,197
Occupation: Politician

2
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,232
Jaran Jitthanya

3
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,032
Jaran Jitthanya

4
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,156
Your Reverence, enter.

5
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,156
Please, wait here just a moment.

6
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,229
Tul, be careful!

7
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,189
Tul!

8
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,116
Tul! Tul!

9
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,195
You're awake!

10
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,031
Where am l?

11
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,196
Dr. Sruang's clinic.

12
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,194
What about Jaran?

13
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,996
He's dead.

14
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,149
Tul, how are you?

15
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,196
Don't get up yet!
Don't get up yet!

16
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,237
OK, let me have a look
at your eyes, please.

17
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,196
When can I go home, doctor?

18
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,115
What are you in such a hurry for?

19
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,197
I don't like it here.

20
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,031
I don't like you being here either,

21
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,032
but you've been here
for nearly 3 months already.

22
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,992
You're really lucky.

23
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,119
In cases like this, only one
in a million survives.

24
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,116
The question is:

25
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,993
Will I be seeing everything
upside down forever,

26
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,235
or is it only temporary?

27
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,030
7 YEARS AND FlVE MONTHS EARLlER

28
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,235
You've got no girlfriend, so
keep these fish for now, Tul,

29
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,118
so you won't be lonely.

30
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,074
I copied this for you to read.

31
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,077
What's it about, Yut?

32
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,151
You'd better read it yourself.

33
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,191
It's weird as hell.

34
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,233
The author is a doctor,
but uses the pen name "Demon".

35
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,113
Gene-pools, Parasites
and Justice by Demon

36
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,156
This "Demon" is a total weirdo.

37
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,156
He says people

38
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,035
aren't born with any kindness
or any morals whatsoever

39
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,994
but are created from
evil as their foundation.

40
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,991
Selfishness...

41
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,112
There are evil genes in
control of the human body.

42
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,236
Therefore, in order to
take care of evil people,

43
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,112
one must take care of
the source of the evil.

44
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,231
That's why we must control
the evolution of human genes.

45
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,197
If we let the genes
evolve by themselves,

46
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,032
the strongest genes would
definitely be the winners.

47
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,190
However, those strongest genes

48
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,152
are likely to be the most evil ones.

49
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,113
Don't you think that's weird?

50
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,076
Hands up!

51
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,198
Freeze! Freeze!
This is the police!

52
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,196
Keep your hands on your head!
Keep your hands on your head!

53
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,189
Don't move!
Get back towards the wall!

54
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,117
Turn your faces away!
Freeze!

55
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,112
Get your hands up on the wall!

56
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,031
Yut!

57
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,150
Excellent!

58
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,078
You're on your way
to the monkey house!

59
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,079
I had to train like a blind person
when I was a cop.

60
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,992
Yut told me I'd better train.

61
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,190
He said it had saved
his life many times

62
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,032
when he had to fight any
crooks in the dark.

63
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,998
Drop the gun!

64
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,116
Get up!

65
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,151
Tul,

66
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,038
may I have 15 minutes of your time?

67
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,031
Who are you?

68
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,197
I'm a lawyer for the owner
of the factory you raided.

69
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,110
What do you want?

70
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,069
Do you know who the
owner of the factory is?

71
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,115
The brother of a minister.

72
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,195
Whoever watched the news in
the entire country probably knows too.

73
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,109
Why?

74
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,031
In here is 5 million in cash.

75
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,193
Just drop the case and
all of this money is yours.

76
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,191
But the evidence was on national TV.

77
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,071
Oh, you mean that video clip?

78
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,113
Just tell them it was a fake
and it'll all be over.

79
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,156
I think you'd better go.

80
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,076
If 5 million isn't enough,
I'll make it 10.

81
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,231
Hey! You want go in with your boss?

82
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,195
Tul...

83
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,192
If you want to make a
simple issue into a complicated one,

84
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,038
that's fine.

85
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,195
"Demon" said...

86
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,230
Now our society is full of evil people.

87
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,198
Even if we had tougher laws or built
more jails it wouldn't be enough.

88
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,077
We've made enormous investments
in the criminal justice system,

89
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,232
only to realize that it
wasn't the answer.

90
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,153
Some experts say
education is the answer,

91
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,033
but we can already see
that the evil people

92
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,192
are all highly educated.

93
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,153
Taking care of evil with an eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth policy

94
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,028
could be the answer.

95
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,078
Justice doesn't exist in nature

96
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,078
but is something that humans developed.

97
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,232
This is the only true justice.

98
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,155
Miss!

99
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,109
Miss!

100
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,195
Your keys.

101
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,151
Thank you!

102
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,196
What are you looking at?

103
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,110
Nothing.

104
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,992
Are you a cop?

105
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,991
Yes.

106
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,994
I like cops.

107
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,996
What's your name?

108
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,155
Yes?

109
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,110
Joy.

110
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,157
Hey, Dr. Sruang said you have to
finish all the medicine.

111
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,991
OK.

112
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,031
The woman's name is Joy.

113
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,156
I don't know.

114
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,118
OK, I'll wait.

115
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,190
Excuse me...

116
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,149
Where's the girl's body?

117
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,155
Where's the girl's body?

118
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,038
Not only do we have pictures,

119
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,229
we've got a video clip as well.

120
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,232
What do I have to do if I agree?

121
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,113
Make a statement that there isn't
enough evidence in this case.

122
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,117
We'll arrange the press
conference for you.

123
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,237
You only need to read the statement.

124
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,193
You don't need to give
interviews or anything.

125
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,158
However, my offer just changed.

126
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,197
You don't get any money.

127
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,234
OK?

128
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,079
Oh, there's one more thing you must do.

129
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,149
What?

130
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,028
You must apologize to the
minister's younger brother

131
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,190
at the press conference.

132
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,156
Dear Demon,

133
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,112
I used to believe that
humans were born with morals,

134
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,118
knowing what's right and
wrong and having compassion.

135
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,032
We've evolved much more than animals.

136
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,078
But now, I'm not so sure.

137
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,998
Perhaps, our world is really
full of evil people's genes.

138
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,032
Like you wrote in your
gene-pool article.

139
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,038
Day by day, the
fucking capitalist system

140
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,190
fosters the evil genes,
making them stronger

141
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,070
and able to propagate faster.

142
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,199
Until one day they'll destroy
everything like you said.

143
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,156
I've spent nearly two months in jail.

144
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,033
I've written many
letters to "The Demon",

145
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,072
but I never sent any of them.

146
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,158
I think I only wrote
them out of boredom,

147
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,235
but the last one I decided to send.

148
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,110
I really don't know anything.

149
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,153
They paid me 50000 to sleep with
you and wait till you were asleep.

150
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,076
Of course, I took it.

151
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,156
So how did you know
that I'd fall asleep?

152
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,998
- I spiked your drink.
- Yeah?

153
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,031
So then?

154
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,196
Then there were these two guys

155
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,992
who said they were your friends.

156
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,994
They wanted to pull a joke on
you before you got married.

157
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,072
I even wondered what kind
of sick joke is this?

158
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,190
They're heroin smugglers!

159
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,993
Cop killers!

160
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,189
Yet you helped them get away!

161
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,076
How could I have known?

162
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,197
I was just minding my own business.

163
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,190
At least you didn't actually die.

164
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,038
If you had, I'd feel
really bad about myself.

165
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,076
Chat, sir.

166
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,150
I'm sorry.

167
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,072
Tul, you've got visitors!

168
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,110
I'm "The Demon".

169
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,117
Yes.

170
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,156
Sruang Santiprasoert.

171
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,158
When I was in prison they
called me Dr. Sruang.

172
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,112
I got your letter a few days ago.

173
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,112
I didn't write in the letter
to ask you to visit me, did l?

174
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,156
Of course not,

175
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,033
but I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

176
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,031
You'd better talk fast.

177
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,236
In fifteen minutes I have
to go clean the toilets.

178
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,195
OK.

179
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,152
I would like you to work with us.

180
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,231
You can see that
I'm in prison, right?

181
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,197
If you agree to work with us, then

182
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,077
I can get you out of
here within two weeks.

183
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,158
Do you know me?

184
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,117
You're the only cop who dared
to arrest the minister's brother.

185
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,988
I also know they tried
to shut your mouth,

186
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,151
but you wouldn't cooperate.

187
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,118
That's why you're here.

188
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,236
What kind of work do
you want me to do?

189
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,156
You don't have much time
let's make this quick.

190
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,196
I'm delighted to know
you've recovered.

191
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,993
Name, Art Dechawat, age 54.

192
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,110
He's the owner of a slaughterhouse.

193
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,031
His other businesses include

194
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,159
illegal liquor, human trafficking
and supplying girls to politicians.

195
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,112
Art Dechawat is the owner
of a slaughterhouse.

196
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,998
His primary business is illegal liquor.

197
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,998
His secondary business is
supplying girls to politicians.

198
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,197
He's been accused of contracting 3
murders, but got off each time

199
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,998
because of his influences within
the major political parties.

200
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,197
The slaughterhouse is only a front.

201
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,078
This is my first assignment after
I left Dr. Sruang's clinic.

202
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,196
I don't even know how I'll do it,

203
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,035
seeing everything upside down like this.

204
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,036
An expert assassin?

205
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,071
Yes.

206
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,191
We exterminate traitors,
drug dealers, pimps,

207
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,079
illegal loggers, stock
speculators, and tax evaders.

208
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,030
Most of them are either
politicians or businessmen.

209
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,077
But...

210
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,991
is it legitimate?

211
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,192
It depends on how you view legitimacy.

212
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,999
You're in jail because
you've been blackmailed.

213
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,076
Can you call that legitimate?

214
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,998
Are you the leader of
The Legion of Demons?

215
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,234
Oh... not at all.

216
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,111
No one knows who the leader is.

217
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,151
Even I don't know.

218
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,158
I don't even know if he's in Thailand.

219
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,119
So you're asking me
to become a hit-man?

220
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,075
We prefer the term "expert assassin".

221
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,033
I'm in jail because I didn't want to
cooperate with a gang of crooks.

222
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,115
What makes you think l'd
cooperate with another gang?

223
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,235
No!

224
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,031
Thin! Don't! Don't!

225
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,149
Let's go! Don't!

226
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,071
Go!

227
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,112
I'd like to resign.

228
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,038
What do you mean?

229
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,117
I don't know either.

230
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,038
Ever since I got shot,

231
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,237
I've had a bad feeling.

232
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,236
So what are you going to do?

233
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,236
I don't know.

234
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,037
Go upcountry and see my mother.

235
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,188
KLONG KWANG PRlSON

236
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,159
4YEARS AND 6 MONTHS AGO

237
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,190
What are you doing over here?

238
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,113
You got released today.
So I've come to pick you up.

239
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,155
To take me where?

240
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,189
Wherever you'd like to go...

241
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,076
I'll take you there.

242
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,155
I don't know.

243
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,998
Just a while ago I thought l
needed to find a toilet.

244
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,236
Would you mind drinking
whiskey from a coffee cup?

245
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,157
I haven't washed the glasses yet.

246
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,236
Who taught you to draw?

247
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,996
Nobody.

248
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,157
One day I saw a deaf person
drawing pictures to sell.

249
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,149
I thought it was beautiful
so I decided to draw some myself.

250
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,236
Did it take long to learn
to draw like this?

251
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,156
Not too long.

252
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,036
Don't tell me, this is you?

253
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,111
Yeah, that's me.

254
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,157
You look so sad in this one.

255
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,118
My name isn't really Joy.

256
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,034
Oh, what's your name then?

257
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,993
Tiwa.

258
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,989
The clients prefer a foreign name.

259
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,196
I'll just call you Tiwa.

260
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,033
I don't like foreign names.

261
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,153
How many years were you in prison?

262
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,189
Three.

263
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,193
If we just just kiss but don't have
sex, can you handle it?

264
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,151
Why?

265
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,036
Well...

266
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,999
We hardly know each other.
I don't want to rush.

267
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,151
No way...

268
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,199
Why did you ask if l'd
be able to handle it?

269
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,076
I don't know.

270
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,994
You've been in prison
for three years.

271
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,112
I don't know.

272
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,153
Well, let's try then.

273
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,032
Quit it, Tiwa.

274
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,993
If I quit, would you be
able to take care of me?

275
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,151
Yeah.

276
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,039
What would you do
to earn a living?

277
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,079
I don't know anything else
except shooting a gun.

278
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,074
So, should I become a hit-man?

279
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,236
Tiwa.

280
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,152
Let's get married.

281
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,072
But I'm not a good person.

282
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,078
I don't like good people.

283
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,237
They die fast.

284
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,151
Hello.

285
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,118
I'm glad you're home.

286
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,998
Who's this?

287
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,195
Hello.

288
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,156
I think you've got the wrong guy.

289
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,191
I don't think so.

290
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,072
Your name's Tul, right?

291
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,230
We know you've killed
lots of people,

292
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,150
but we want to know who ordered it.

293
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,031
I've never killed anyone.

294
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,152
There's no need for you
to deny it so quickly.

295
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,113
We found plenty of
evidence in your room.

296
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,112
You killed a member of
the Bamrungthai party.

297
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,151
A hit-man disguised as a monk,

298
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,156
assassinated in front of his house,

299
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,156
Jaran Jitthanya,

300
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,073
a famous M.P.

301
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,079
You savagely killed Sia Toi,
mafia boss of second hand cars.

302
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,152
You killed Sia Han, mafia boss of
the Loyfa gambling den in Wisuthkasat.

303
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,118
Hit-man of two savage assassinations.

304
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,199
Art Dechawat and his secretary
died in their room.

305
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,992
There... a picture of Art.

306
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,032
We found it under your sofa.

307
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,118
We know that you did everything.

308
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,993
Tell us, who ordered you to
kill all of those people?

309
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,071
That's it and we'll let you go.

310
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,038
Are you all cops or something?

311
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,038
Don't move!

312
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,111
Tul.

313
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,073
I'll ask you one more time, OK?

314
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,119
Who ordered you to
kill those people?

315
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,150
Who ordered it?

316
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,151
Tul.

317
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,235
I told you I didn't kill anybody!

318
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,991
Stop!

319
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,155
Drive!

320
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,189
Drive!

321
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,071
Drive! Drive!

322
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,149
What are you looking at?

323
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,111
Keep driving!

324
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,156
Have you got anything to eat?

325
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,234
Got anything to eat?

326
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,031
I've got fried pork skin.

327
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,111
Where is it?

328
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,231
- Where is it?
- On the floor!

329
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,152
Where do you want me to drive to?

330
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,078
Where are you going?

331
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,071
Chumphon.

332
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,038
OK, let's go there.

333
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,033
Turn on the speakers
so I can hear it too.

334
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,033
Don't talk too long.

335
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,199
Hello?

336
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,029
Toh.

337
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,029
What's up?

338
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,189
Where are you?

339
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,117
I'm driving.

340
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,073
Oh yeah? Did you get the
pork skin I sent yet?

341
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,111
Yes, yes, I got it.

342
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,071
Was it good?

343
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,035
Hello?

344
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,237
Hello. It was delicious....
delicous.

345
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,152
Toh, I'm driving now.

346
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,031
I'll talk to you later.

347
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,116
OK.

348
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,110
Can I stop at a gas station?

349
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,158
I need to use the toilet.

350
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,116
Lunatic.

351
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,236
Comfortable, eh?

352
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,156
Please, I beg you...

353
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,156
Let go!

354
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,031
Is there a power failure?

355
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,111
Your boyfriend told
me to turn it off.

356
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,037
My boyfriend?

357
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,032
Uh... that guy.

358
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,038
Who said he's my boyfriend?

359
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,999
Well... I saw you came together.

360
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,036
Where's the power switch?

361
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,992
On the wall over there.

362
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,230
Usually, I'm not like this...

363
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,196
I just needed someone to drive for me.

364
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,150
I guess you usually ride a buffalo.

365
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,236
Is that why you can't drive?

366
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,156
Hey, what are you doing?

367
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,116
I'm not doing anything.

368
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,078
Stop the bleeding.

369
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,230
Thank you.

370
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,112
Where are we now?

371
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,072
Chumphon.

372
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,038
I'm sorry about hijacking you.

373
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,189
You can go now.

374
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,232
Aren't you afraid that
I'll turn you in?

375
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,189
I'm not afraid.

376
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,152
I'm sick and tired of a
life like this already.

377
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,073
So what's your name then?

378
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,071
Tul.

379
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,190
My name's Rin.

380
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,157
I haven't seen anything
like this for a long time.

381
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,158
My home's like this too.

382
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,032
So why don't you go home?

383
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,156
I can't go back.

384
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,073
Aren't you welcome there anymore?

385
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,112
Are you like this all the time?

386
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,229
Like what?

387
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,032
Snapping at anyone.

388
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,235
I only snap at crooks.

389
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,074
How come you think I'm a crook?

390
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,072
There's two kinds of people
who carry guns.

391
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,190
Cops and crooks.

392
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,157
You're not a cop,
so you must be a crook.

393
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,151
What's your name?

394
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,037
Tul.

395
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,071
Where are you from?

396
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,073
I've lost my way...

397
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,156
Your Reverence...

398
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,992
I was waiting for when
you'd get rid of it.

399
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,230
Do you know who I am?

400
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,118
I don't know and I don't want to know.

401
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,232
Wherever you've come from,
whatever you did, it doesn't matter.

402
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,069
You're in a temple, so you
should leave all your sins behind.

403
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,153
Leave your gun on the tray over
there and recite my prayers.

404
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,195
Yes, sir.

405
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,998
That's right, that's it.

406
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:47,990
I can't help being a bit jealous
of Tiwa on the day she left.

407
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:59,110
Jealous that she won't have to
live in this awful world anymore.

408
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,998
Jealous that she can rest,

409
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,190
while I still have to struggle on.

410
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,078
There's only one thing bothering me.

411
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,113
All that time I'd been with Tiwa,
I never knew she was on drugs.

412
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,039
I stayed with her
until the police arrived.

413
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,038
The police instantly
concluded it was an OD.

414
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,112
For days after I tried to inquire
about any progress in the case.

415
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,113
You know what the officer
in charge of the case told me?

416
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,035
He told me...

417
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,153
Hookers on drugs OD-ing
is quite common.

418
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,232
We see this daily.

419
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,034
I should've known it
would end like this.

420
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,119
Just because of that simple reason,
the case was closed.

421
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:14,118
Justice never existed in this world
since the beginning, Mr. Demon.

422
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,112
It's exactly like you said.

423
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,199
We have to make it ourselves.

424
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,150
Now I know

425
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,239
which direction my life will go.

426
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,038
Your Reverence, disrobe me please.

427
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,037
Why?

428
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,078
Someone's trying to kill me.

429
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:57,075
I'm wearing monk's robes and it'd
be a grave sin if I killed him.

430
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,231
Stop!

431
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,151
Go! Go! Go!

432
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,993
The pork skin's in the back.

433
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,195
You again?

434
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,156
What the hell are you talking about?

435
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,038
Did you leave the monk-hood already?

436
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,037
Fifteen minutes ago.

437
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,069
Why?

438
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,155
Someone's trying to kill me.

439
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,079
That's not unusual,
I'd like to kill you too.

440
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,158
So, now where would you like to go?

441
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,118
Back to Bangkok...

442
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,189
You'll have to find another car.

443
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,031
Don't worry, I won't hijack
you to Bangkok.

444
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,157
I can't go even if you hijack me.

445
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,191
Where's the jack?

446
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,156
What's a jack?

447
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,071
Is there a garage around here?

448
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:09,157
Yes, two kilometers from here.

449
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,156
Stay down! Stay down!

450
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,078
Don't go! Don't go! Rin!

451
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,196
Rin! Don't run!

452
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,072
Where are you going?

453
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,199
How come all of a sudden,
a cop became a crook?

454
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,196
How did you know?

455
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:26,119
I had a peek in your wallet.

456
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,190
I'm sorry.

457
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:54,153
Why? Wasn't the salary of a cop enough?

458
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,110
I didn't do it for the money.

459
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:03,028
I may have killed people,
but I'm not a crook.

460
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,079
If you don't believe
me, it doesn't matter.

461
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,032
I believe you.

462
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,190
The dead guy's name was Thin.

463
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,230
He was my assistant.

464
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,073
So why was he tracking
you down to kill you?

465
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,236
I think my boss sent him.

466
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,993
Maybe, you're of no use to them anymore.

467
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,032
That's why they'll
have to terminate you.

468
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,997
Right?

469
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,038
You think so?

470
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,038
I think it's worse than that.

471
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,156
Like what?

472
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,118
Perhaps I've got a bad
view of the world.

473
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,032
At first when you told me that...

474
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,078
you didn't want to work like this.

475
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,993
Then, when your girlfriend died,

476
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,076
the police weren't
interested in the case.

477
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,036
That's why you decided to do it...

478
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,073
because you wanted to get
revenge on the police.

479
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,998
It may have been a setup.

480
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,038
What does setup mean?

481
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:50,148
Is it possible that
your girlfriend was killed?

482
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,191
Is it possible

483
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,196
that whoever killed her,

484
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:03,073
was the person who wanted you
to get revenge on the cops?

485
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,071
Tul?

486
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,078
What are you doing here?

487
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:38,038
Did you send Thin to kill me?

488
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,037
What?

489
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,235
You sent Thin to kill me, right?

490
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,156
Why would I do that?

491
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,993
So what have you been doing?

492
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,991
Been a monk?

493
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,037
Tul,

494
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,032
how many years have
you been working with us?

495
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,152
You know we only kill people
whose names are on the list.

496
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,191
We don't kill randomly.

497
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,232
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

498
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,038
Don't move! Don't budge.

499
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,111
It's me.

500
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,196
We had to do it.

501
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:38,076
We wanted you to think the
doctor sent Thin to kill you.

502
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,150
Then you would bring us here.

503
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,031
You hired Thin?

504
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,109
We killed him.

505
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,190
Then we dumped the body there.

506
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,110
Who are you?

507
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:59,112
I'm Tohphong Jitthanya.

508
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,994
- You're...
- The son of Jaran Jitthanya.

509
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,112
The person you sent that guy to kill.

510
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,196
We caught and interrogated
him once already,

511
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,196
but he kept his mouth shut.

512
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,992
So, we deliberately let him escape.

513
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,196
Then when you became a monk

514
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,190
everything was in place.

515
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,077
How did you know
I became a monk?

516
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,237
How did we know
you were in the monk-hood?

517
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,071
Thanks for helping me.

518
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,031
I didn't intend to help you.

519
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,196
You were pointing a
gun at me, remember?

520
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,152
Don't kill anymore, OK?

521
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,157
Go back upcountry, trust me.

522
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,198
You don't understand.

523
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,112
I hope we'll never meet again.

524
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,156
I'm sorry for what I did.

525
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,156
Rin.

526
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,111
Erin!

527
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,149
Yes...

528
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,151
She's my sister.

529
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,993
Does anyone have any more questions?

530
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,033
If there aren't any more questions
then Tul can go home.

531
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,031
I have no more business with you.

532
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,112
However, the doctor must
stay a little while longer.

533
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,112
If you want to get revenge on
someone then it should be me, right?

534
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,195
I killed your father.

535
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,078
Please, don't try to be a hero.

536
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,153
You sent those people to kill me
even though your sister was there.

537
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,152
You knew there was a
chance she'd get shot.

538
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,151
One of them nearly killed her!

539
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,119
If that's what it took to find out
who ordered my father's death,

540
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,988
then I can sacrifice a sister.

541
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,112
Then you're a worse shit
than your father.

542
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,033
Bow at my feet right now!

543
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,150
I told you bow at my feet!

544
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,075
1...

545
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,115
2...

546
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,038
Where are you going?
Get in!

547
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,234
You'll get shot and killed!

548
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,069
Quick!

549
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,032
Why did you turn off
the power to help me?

550
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,991
Why did you turn off
the power to help me?

551
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,036
Clean your face first.

552
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,111
Why did you think it was me?

553
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,195
I knew it was you.

554
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,994
I won't ask you how you
know where I live.

555
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,156
I know a lot about you,

556
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,118
but not everything.

557
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,192
Perhaps you don't know that

558
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,033
I see the rain falling towards the sky.

559
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,036
What does that mean?

560
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,031
That day...

561
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,076
I killed your father.

562
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,993
I was shot in the head.

563
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,998
I was in a coma for 3 months.

564
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,076
When I woke up,

565
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,151
everything I saw was upside down.

566
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,998
So right now you see
me upside down?

567
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,196
So how do you feel?

568
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,150
Even upside down, you're beautiful.

569
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,151
I mean...

570
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,994
how does it feel seeing
everything upside down?

571
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,077
At first, I was very annoyed,

572
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,112
but now I think it's the best
thing that happened to me

573
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:33,038
for many years.

574
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,152
What do you mean?

575
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:47,199
Before, I could see everything
like everyone else.

576
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,237
I'd recognize anything
with just a glance,

577
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:56,038
but now I must look at anything

578
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,190
or anyone thoroughly.

579
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,072
It's made me see everything clearer.

580
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:11,119
Is that why you stopped
being a hit-man?

581
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,031
I had to quit anyway.

582
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,157
I could never shoot anyone seeing
everything upside down like this.

583
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,229
That's not true!

584
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,110
I've seen a blind
person play ping pong.

585
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,155
Could he play well?

586
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:37,199
Being blind and able to play ping
pong, isn't that good enough?

587
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,111
Doctor...

588
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,230
I've got a question
I'd like to ask you.

589
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,036
What?

590
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,235
Doctor...

591
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:37,999
Doctor, did you kill Tiwa
so I'd come work with you?

592
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:22,072
Once again, I spent my
life as a prisoner.

593
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:26,153
This time I wasn't able to
remember for how many years.

594
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:34,234
The monotonous prison life didn't
make me bored or tormented.

595
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:44,992
In fact, it even made me peaceful,
sensible and steadfast.

596
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,192
I knew on the day I got my freedom back

597
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,158
what I'd do for the rest of my life.

598
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,998
Rin got married 5 years ago.

599
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,031
She has a daughter.

600
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:18,076
I saw her at the temple once.

601
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,072
On the fifth anniversary
of her father's death...

602
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:28,030
That day I just returned from
receiving my morning alms...

603
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,031
She greeted me.

604
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,195
But we didn't speak.

605
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,152
Everything seemed to ease up

606
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:02,119
and my consciousness
appeared to be more awake.

607
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,078
I started to hear the wind blowing...

608
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,192
the sounds of chickens and birds...

609
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:18,079
I heard water flowing in the stream.

610
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,993
For a long time I've been searching

611
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,077
for something lost,
and for a really long time

612
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,033
I've travelled everywhere

613
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:56,069
searching for something lost...
something lost.

614
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,156
Many people have told me

615
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:07,189
that my life was so perfect.

616
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:10,038
Who really knows

617
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,997
about

618
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:15,032
my life...

619
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:18,157
what it's really like?

620
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:25,197
My life isn't smooth

621
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,998
and not that perfect.

622
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:32,231
Like you and many people

623
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,038
have seen.

624
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:39,192
I may smile, I may laugh.

625
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,197
Who knows... who really knows?

626
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,197
Nowadays, I'm just

627
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,992
a traveler.

628
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,197
I'm traveling in search for

629
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,190
something lost...

630
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:08,118
something lost.

631
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:17,988
Don't ask me

632
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,112
when will you stop

633
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,156
traveling?

634
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:28,109
Sometimes, I even

635
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:31,192
question myself

636
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:37,232
about something lost.

637
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,998
I ask myself

638
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:54,074
about something lost...

639
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,151
something lost.
