1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,399
Come here.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,871
Go on, slide down.

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,557
- I'm...
- You're scared. Come on.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,993
Get them.

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,393
Hide in here.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,469
What now?

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,588
- Take your clothes off.
- Why?!

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,109
- Will you just do as I say?
- What do you think you're doing?!

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,068
This is a dead end. We'll split up.

10
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,948
I got you.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,588
My God!

12
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,871
Who dares to do that?!
He'll get six months for this!

13
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,948
- Sorry, sir.
- It was you!

14
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,155
Yeah. Are you all right?

15
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,273
I'm all right. But you're in trouble.

16
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,795
No. I'm all right. See you around.

17
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,153
- I got caught in your handcuffs.
- You're arrested.

18
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,310
Deserting the force! You'll be hung.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,037
I'll go to the police station myself.
Can you let me go?

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,951
No way. I'm short of officers
at the moment.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,475
- We're looking for the missing...
- They're found.

22
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,873
Really? Tell me, have you got them?

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,834
I mean I've found
the missing girls.

24
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,438
Girls again.
What else do you know about?

25
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,588
Come on.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,352
Can we go the other way?

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,671
You're arrested and handcuffed,
you'll have to follow me.

28
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,992
I know this type of handcuff
inside out.

29
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,912
I can get my hands out of them
just like this.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,355
- Can I borrow your bicycle?
- Stop him!

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,308
Stop whistling!
Don't waste your breath. Free me.

32
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,915
Get out of the way.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,433
What's going on?

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,709
Who is it?

35
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,990
- Crazy fool!
- Out of the way.

36
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,435
There he is.

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,997
- There!
- Don't worry about me, after him.

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,399
Keep clear!

39
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,832
Watch out!

40
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,034
Keep clear.

41
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,348
- He'll be OK.
- Out of the way!

42
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,191
Out of the way!

43
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,711
- Use the brakes, you idiot.
- It doesn't have any.

44
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,437
That's another one you owe me.

45
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,396
- You should...
- Out of the way.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,193
Give me your hand.

47
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,355
- Are you leaving Fei here?
- He's a good-for-nothing. Let's go.

48
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,552
Running out on me! Where else
can you find such a good friend?

49
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,788
You lied to me.

50
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,757
- Do you want to fight?
- If you want.

51
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,788
Save it till later.
Let's take care of this first.

52
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,798
No?

53
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,838
- How about this?
- Enough? No?

54
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,033
Not enough? OK.

55
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,072
Let's go.

56
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,750
- They have guns.
- Keep your head.

57
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,831
But the bullets will blow it off.

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,480
Now, you can't get out of this one.

59
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,517
We've got help.

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,959
Captain Chi.

61
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,309
What a surprise!
Fancy seeing you after all this time.

62
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,870
Get him! Stealing government
property, insulting a superior.

63
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,396
What's more, I caused
serious injuries to some people.

64
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,629
- Handcuff this lunatic.
- Hurry.

65
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,949
There's been a serious road accident.

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,189
I caused it! It was me.

67
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,033
- Go and see if anyone's injured.
- Come on.

68
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,754
Winnie.

69
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,468
Hey, Winnie?

70
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,759
Look at the state you're in.
Go home at once.

71
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,795
Go home now!

72
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,870
- Go on.
- See you, Dragon.

73
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,668
- Fei. I've got to go now.
- Bye.

74
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,788
You, fatty, your face looks familiar.

75
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,639
But I don't believe we've met.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,711
That voice sounds familiar, too.

77
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,678
I'm known as the crazy guy!
Is that familiar, too?

78
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,634
Mind your manners, young man.

79
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,355
I'm not committing a crime.

80
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,035
Remember, we've a score to settle.

81
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,629
Thanks for giving me that life belt.

82
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,516
- Don't mention...
- He's the thief! Stop him!

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,675
- Captain, please!
- Stop that man.

84
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,151
That ex-cop's got our rifles.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
This type of cuff you know too well!

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,514
- You won't do that again.
- Come back. Don't leave me here.

87
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,511
Captain, take me to the station!

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,149
Lock me up in prison.
I'm the sex maniac...

89
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,870
Don't shoot. Too many people.

90
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,237
- You double-crossed us.
- Who are you?

91
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,673
Where are the guns?

92
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,558
Come on!

93
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,989
Where are my rifles?

94
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,879
Talk! Where are the rifles?

95
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,315
Talk!

96
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,629
Hang on!

97
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,436
Hold tight. Help's on the way.

98
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,828
I'll fetch some mattresses.

99
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,993
Don't bother.

100
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,437
He's going to fall.

101
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,479
Dragon!

102
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,554
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

103
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,995
- I've proved one thing at least.
- What?

104
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,913
There is such a thing as gravity.

105
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,996
Take them back to the station.

106
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,951
The rear admiral is on his way here
to capture the pirates.

107
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,154
But the pirates have captured
him instead. What should I do now?

108
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,553
I suggest we get some policemen
to go out and blockade the water.

109
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,357
Stop the sea traffic.

110
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,591
But that would be crazy.
We are in the shipping business.

111
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,830
If you blockade these waters,

112
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:25,629
San-po may still escape and we
shippers will be put out of business.

113
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,989
Apart from blockading the water,
do you have any other ideas?

114
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,878
Don't forget the pirates
have the rear admiral.

115
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,677
He's our first priority.

116
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,639
Should anything happen to him,
I'd be sent home.

117
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,198
But this is your home!

118
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,590
Doesn't matter where my home is,
we must save the admiral's life.

119
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,955
We have to come up with a good plan.

120
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,870
- Sit down, Mr Chou.
- Thank you.

121
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,389
Please carry on, but I have to
meet someone. Excuse me.

122
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,149
What the pirates want is money,
and I can use the security fund.

123
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,116
But I need a middleman.

124
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,953
I've noticed your company's ships
have never been robbed by them.

125
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,158
So I think you'll be the best
candidate. Do you see what I mean?

126
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,155
That's straight talking.

127
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,958
I'm always willing to work
for the government.

128
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,508
But some of my men
have been arrested...

129
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,477
I'll order the captain
to release them.

130
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,038
I've always admired
people who get knighted.

131
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,873
I can arrange something for you,
as well.

132
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,875
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

133
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,389
In order to sail my ships safely,
I have some contact with the pirates.

134
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,232
But this time,
I'll go personally to see San-po.

135
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,676
I'll need 100 rifles
to give him as a present.

136
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,196
If the rifles can save the admiral,
I'll think about it.

137
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,351
Let me know as soon as possible.
Thanks for your time.

138
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,238
- Bye now.
- You'll hear from me soon.

139
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,434
Good day.

140
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,918
- Good day.
- This way.

141
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,076
Who are you?

142
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,873
A coast guard, Sergeant Ma.

143
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,028
I did once belong
to the coast guard, sir.

144
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,472
What are you doing here?

145
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,118
The pirates have the admiral.
I thought you'd need us again.

146
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,509
I was expecting some good news.

147
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,470
But I overheard you making deals
with that scum Chou.

148
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,269
You don't understand. I'm doing
this to save the admiral's life.

149
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,669
You're more concerned
with your career.

150
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,909
Think of all those
who have been captured.

151
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,069
There was no ransom for them.

152
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,839
The security fund is intended
to free our seas.

153
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,480
It was donated
to safeguard our shores.

154
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,676
You're abusing your position
to further your career!

155
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,228
You're letting
the Hong Kong people down.

156
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,951
You won't arrest the one
who does business with the pirates,

157
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,315
but you are willing to see
the scum knighted.

158
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,355
Does the queen pay you to do that?

159
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,355
You know tigers are carnivores
and now you're feeding them.

160
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,150
As soon as San-po gets those rifles,
how many more men will be killed?

161
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,191
You spend your money on antiques.

162
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,954
How about all the wives waiting
for husbands they'll never see again?

163
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,597
How about the orphans?

164
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,997
Do you think I don't want to destroy
them? Do you think I'm a coward?

165
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,471
The Royal Navy is too far away.
What can I fight the pirates with?

166
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,673
We can't beat them with guns,
how about brains?

167
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,673
If we use the right strategy, we can
destroy San-po and save the hostages.

168
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,835
- Do you have anything in mind?
- No!

169
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,355
- No...
- I have to think.

170
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,034
But I won't give up now.
Let's think about it.

171
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,913
You're in charge of the rescue now.
I need a good idea.

172
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,076
- I can do it my way, sir?
- Get to work.

173
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,868
Take care.

174
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:50,115
Thank you for the donation.

175
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,909
Father, the coast guard's flag.

176
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,275
Project A shall proceed as planned.

177
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,512
Help me!

178
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:03,630
Come here, you!

179
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,798
Get rid of him.

180
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:12,914
- Get out of here.
- You are safe now.

181
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:14,991
Thank you, Mr Chou.

182
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:19,029
- You know my name?
- Everybody knows you here.

183
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,071
Perhaps I can give you a lift.

184
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,913
- I was going to get some noodles.
- Let me.

185
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,392
- Driver.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,355
- Go and get some noodles.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,271
The night is rather cold.
Let's wait inside.

188
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,114
She's pretty.

189
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,357
I must admit I didn't realise
that you were such a gentlemen.

190
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,147
That depends. If she's a pretty
young thing like you...

191
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,308
I think good manners are important.

192
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,953
Come on, quick!

193
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:09,153
- What's wrong?
- The coach was shaking. I...

194
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,835
What are you doing? You don't need to
worry about me! Close the door.

195
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,114
Yes, sir.

196
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,067
- What was the matter with you?
- Shut up.

197
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:22,757
- Take over, I need a leak.
- Yeah, hurry.

198
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,518
They're really having fun!

199
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,393
Quick!

200
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,588
That feels better.

201
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,237
Come on.

202
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,116
Easy, don't get carried away.

203
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,473
I'm not a cop now.
I can do anything.

204
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,188
We're fighting the pirates and
you're on their side! You bastard!

205
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,953
- Easy!
- Leave me alone!

206
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,473
How can I write my report
if you kill him?

207
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,469
If you beat him up like that,
he's going to die.

208
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,313
So what? We can pretend he died
trying to escape.

209
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,196
Tzu, please don't let him kill me.

210
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,034
If you want to live,
tell us how you contact the pirates.

211
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,429
You're wasting time
with scum like that. Turn away.

212
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,759
Don't kill me.
I'll tell you everything.

213
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,679
What if you lie?

214
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,038
He wouldn't dare.
He knows he would die.

215
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,431
How do you contact them? Talk!

216
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,357
On the 2nd of every month,

217
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,910
San-po's boat docks at the west pier.

218
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,391
There will be three strings of
firecrackers hanging from the sail.

219
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,877
Going across?
Are you going to the fireworks shop?

220
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,237
- What do you want from there?
- Fireworks.

221
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,989
- How do you light them?
- With three sticks of incense.

222
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,911
And which stick goes first?

223
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,156
I'll use them all together.

224
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,958
- Give me your name.
- Are you a fortune teller?

225
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,792
I want to use your boat.
Are you taking me across?

226
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,471
The password's right.
Please come aboard.

227
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:27,347
- These are presents for your boss.
- My men will take care of them.

228
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,911
- Let's go and wait for his news.
- Set sail.

229
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,074
I'll get drunk in there.

230
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,958
- What are you doing?
- And what are you doing?

231
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,190
I'm on a mission to San-po's hideout.

232
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,034
Me, too.

233
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,990
- You can't go. It's too dangerous!
- OK, I'll tell them to turn back.

234
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,596
Easy. You'd better hide again.

235
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,192
Not in there.
I can't stand it any more.

236
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,679
Hide down there.

237
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,478
We're nearly there.

238
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,513
I want to save the hostages
and possibly capture all the pirates.

239
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,750
Best of luck! But count me out.

240
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,714
Just keep out of my sight.

241
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,795
Don't worry. While you play the hero,
I'll get a little ready cash.

242
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,153
It's a deal.

243
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,308
Tell the chief they're here.

244
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,755
- Help unload the ship.
- Come on.

245
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,228
This way.

246
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:32,311
Sir, this way.

247
00:27:06,598 --> 00:27:09,192
- Chou Wing-ling.
- Lord of the sea.

248
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,074
I'm the devil of the sea, but
suddenly I've become lord of the sea.

249
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,070
Mr Chou, I am impressed by you.

250
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:18,789
Likewise, Lord of the sea...

251
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,553
- You can call me San.
- Uncle San.

252
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:25,837
I'm only 35!
This life puts years on you I guess.

253
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,558
- San-po.
- Brother.

254
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:30,869
Without a doubt, you're a smart guy.

255
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,031
You've been looking after my ships.
Many thanks for that.

256
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,874
It's tough. Not much fun,
more a matter of life and death.

257
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,757
So when you send me gifts,
I do prefer it to piracy.

258
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,949
Quick.

259
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,592
Put them down here.

260
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,472
I brought the rifles you asked for.
The wine is for your men.

261
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,228
I heard it wasn't easy to get them.

262
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,029
- It's my fault that Cho-kou got...
- I won't blame anyone for that.

263
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,269
I hope you can soon forget about it.

264
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,798
Boss, they're good.

265
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,588
That's the reason Mr Chou
delivered them personally.

266
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,990
Actually,
the Hong Kong governor sent me.

267
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,228
What do you mean?

268
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,151
He's the boss in Hong Kong...

269
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,951
And have you come here
to arrest me and my men?

270
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:38,989
You must be joking!

271
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,036
That British ship you've got,

272
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,317
the governor would like
the release of the prisoners.

273
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,395
You keep the rifles as a present.

274
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:49,317
So the governor is not all bad.

275
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,471
I'll keep the rifles
and the hostages.

276
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,750
If you release the prisoners, I can
talk to the governor more easily.

277
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,990
- Don't bother.
- San-po...

278
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,232
Mr Chou, I'm 35 today. I'm having
a birthday banquet and you must come.

279
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,834
- Sure! About the...
- Just forget about it.

280
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,718
- But...
- Show him his room for the night.

281
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,638
Come this way.

282
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,513
Mr Chou.

283
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,348
There are dangerous paths
and all kinds of snakes here.

284
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,478
- So you'd better stay in your room.
- Thank you for the warning.

285
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,433
- Get those rifles stored away.
- Yes.

286
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:44,156
This way.

287
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:55,232
- Where are these going?
- The storeroom.

288
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,880
Are there any precious items there?

289
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,873
Just fish and dried vegetables.
Precious items are in the treasury.

290
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,837
These rifles will easily
get rusty there.

291
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,310
You're right. They'd better go
to the treasury. Lead the way.

292
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,913
Don't you know the way?

293
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,116
I'm new here.
I've not been there before.

294
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,958
- So, you don't know me?
- No! What's your name?

295
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,999
Don't ask my name.
Take them to the storeroom.

296
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,719
But you said the rifles
would get rusty in there.

297
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,833
They can be polished, right? Hurry.

298
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,429
- There's lots of wine at the party.
- Yeah, I know!

299
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:45,478
It's the right place.
Let's climb the hill.

300
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,112
Grub's up.

301
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,433
You wait here,
I'll go and find Dragon.

302
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,915
- Save us some wine.
- Come on, we're on duty now.

303
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,798
What's the password?

304
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,310
They only gave me hand signals.

305
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,435
- What do you mean?
- This.

306
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,634
Don't move.

307
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,067
The password.

308
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:30,750
A dummy borrows a trumpet
from a lama.

309
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,194
The lama doesn't understand
the dummy.

310
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,395
He gives the dummy a pumpkin.

311
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,993
The dummy tries to signal a trumpet.

312
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,513
The lama gives him a gourd.

313
00:32:40,598 --> 00:32:42,112
The dummy gets mad.

314
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,076
He swears at the lama.

315
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:47,789
- Meaning what?
- It's the password.

316
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,790
I'll ask him first this time.

317
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,313
Password.

318
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,397
Beat me up.

319
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,236
- You can go now.
- How could I have guessed right?!

320
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,509
- What's the password?
- Beat me up.

321
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:22,826
Sure.

322
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,954
What kind of password is that?

323
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,393
It's me.

324
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,630
- Dragon, it's you!
- Where are they?

325
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,674
Over there.

326
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,759
Dragon's here.

327
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,355
Where's Tzu?

328
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,953
- He went to look for you.
- That must have been him.

329
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,554
Big Mouth, come with me.
The rest wait here.

330
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,833
Why did he hit me?
Maybe it's not the password.

331
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,798
- What's the password?
- The stars are out tonight.

332
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,878
Go round that way.

333
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,869
- The password?
- The stars are out tonight.

334
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,757
- No, that's not it.
- Wrong again?

335
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,268
It's Tzu! Where did you get that hat?
Come on, get up.

336
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,757
Row, row.
Row the boat. Row the boat quickly.

337
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,400
I'll row the boat to grandma's home.

338
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,869
Be smart and don't blow the plan.

339
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,550
Mr Chou, what are you doing here?

340
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,949
I'd like to show you this.

341
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,436
Bring them out at the exact time.

342
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,554
I... Forget it.

343
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:35,827
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. You're late, drink this.

344
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,594
To San-po,
may your victories continue.

345
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,717
Come along, sit.

346
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,518
Brother, I've been thinking.

347
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,990
If I keep the English, they'll eat
lots of food. You better take them.

348
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,429
Thank you. Cheers, Brother.

349
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,715
Before the English women go,
they should dance for us. Guards!

350
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,713
They've been locked up for so long
I don't think they'd be up to it.

351
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,949
How about this?

352
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,152
Listen up.

353
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,518
Whoever beats San-po at arm wrestling
will have this gold watch.

354
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:27,431
San-po, can you do it?

355
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,952
Sure.

356
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:33,032
Watch the champion!

357
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,554
- Who's the first man?
- Go on!

358
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,469
- Are you all right, Cho-kou?
- Fine.

359
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,108
Is the boss inside?

360
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,679
- Yes.
- Cho-kou!

361
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,509
Time to get out of here.

362
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,277
Dragon's in trouble now.
I'll have to help him again.

363
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,989
Quickly.

364
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,067
It's Fei!

365
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,275
Is that you, Fei?

366
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,070
Dragon's back there. We have
to get him out or he'll be dead.

367
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,036
- Why?
- Cho-kou just arrived.

368
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,518
- What can we do?
- Listen.

369
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:24,438
We either let Dragon die
or we all die together.

370
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,672
We split up into two groups,
Big Mouth come with me.

371
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:34,230
Tai-po, get the hostages to a boat.
Then blow up the pirates' ships.

372
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,788
- Then leave.
- What about you?

373
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,838
If we don't make it, don't wait.

374
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,634
Tai-po, I guess this is serious.

375
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,474
Should I die, you must tell everyone
why I sacrificed my life.

376
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,550
I envy your opportunity
to become a hero.

377
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,552
Why not change places?
You go back and rescue Dragon.

378
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,155
No, please. We'll stick to the plan.
Be careful!

379
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,076
- Do you know where the rifles are?
- Sure.

380
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,994
Here, Tzu.

381
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,114
This is for you.

382
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,634
- What do I need a hammer for?
- Get moving!

383
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,634
Boss.

384
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,992
Cho-kou.

385
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,954
Cho-kou.

386
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:24,510
- Cho-kou.
- Boss.

387
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,512
- Great to see you back!
- Happy birthday, Boss.

388
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,798
- Good.
- I didn't think I'd see you again.

389
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,155
- Mr Chou.
- Mr Chou, boss wants you.

390
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,349
- Which Mr Chou?
- The one who sold us guns.

391
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,634
Mr Chou is here?

392
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,478
- You!
- I'm really sorry.

393
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,027
- No! I was saying...
- I couldn't help you.

394
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,793
- You're...
- No one can rely upon me now.

395
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,590
- We're all on the same side.
- He's...

396
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,431
What's he done that's so bad?

397
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:01,079
He has a right to be mad at me.
Don't blame him.

398
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,070
- Boss...
- I shouldn't have come.

399
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,673
But I had to deliver the rifles,
what could I do?

400
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:10,833
- You dare to...
- You can beat me or shoot me.

401
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,434
- You...
- You can kill me right here.

402
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:17,317
- You're not Chou.
- I'm not the Chou you once knew.

403
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,311
Boss, he's not Chou!

404
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,311
- Come on...
- He has a point there.

405
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,152
I'm not fit to be called Mr Chou.

406
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,715
I couldn't help him. I'm no good.

407
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,916
- I let my friend down.
- Mr Chou...

408
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,436
I don't want to be called Mr Chou,
it's too depressing.

409
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,753
- See? You've really upset him.
- San-po, I'm going.

410
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,079
Mr Chou, please stay.

411
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:41,833
Thanks, San-po.
I shouldn't have come here.

412
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,478
Boss!

413
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,152
Bad news.

414
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,750
- What's wrong?
- The cops are here.

415
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,398
We can't hold the fort.

416
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,710
Let's go and kill them all.

417
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,233
- Are you all right?
- Why are you here?

418
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,311
I'd be rich now
if it wasn't for you!

419
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,510
- How do the cops know where we are?
- You led the cops here!

420
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,951
- I wonder why you're out of jail.
- Boss, that's bullshit.

421
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,233
Hands up!

422
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,994
I see you've brought
Sergeant Ma, too.

423
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,719
- Who is he?
- He's a sergeant in the coast guard.

424
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:28,556
Cho-kou, thanks a lot.
Now the pirates are finished.

425
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,873
- Boss!
- Why don't you all give up now?

426
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,996
You're surrounded by the police.

427
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,199
No chance.
You don't have that many men.

428
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,989
I saw it! They're all over the place.
Even in the water!

429
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,871
- Don't exaggerate.
- It's serious, believe me.

430
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,670
Cho-kou, you disappoint me.

431
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:51,036
You won't listen now.
Only death can prove my innocence.

432
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,916
Dragon's safe now, but we're not.

433
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,230
- We've got to get out of here.
- How?

434
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:05,476
We're going to blow up your ships.

435
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,514
Boss, did you hear what he said?
Not my ship! No!

436
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,389
Now!

437
00:42:21,518 --> 00:42:22,952
Get them!

438
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,831
Blow up all the entrances.

439
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,992
Mr Chou,
I'll see to him. Watch this!

440
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,469
I'm coming.

441
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:22,317
You're not Chou.

442
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,072
I never said I was.

443
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:21,827
I'll handle it.

444
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:38,831
Don't! You'll blow us up!

445
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,708
Run for it.

446
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,228
Come back!

447
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:56,030
Why are you blowing us all up?

448
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,157
I've got to blow up the entrances
to stop help coming.

449
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,958
Go and help Dragon finish off San-po.

450
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,199
Get them.

451
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,228
- Are you running away?
- Will you miss me?!

452
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,599
Are you all right?

453
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,913
I missed you, friend.

454
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,429
San-po, the game's up.
Give up now.

455
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,791
I will fight until I'm dead.

456
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:52,987
- Are you trying to kill me?!
- Put it back in!

457
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,634
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

458
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,552
All the entrances are blocked,
how do we get out?

459
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,108
- I still have a grenade left.
- Let's go.

460
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,639
Raise the sail.
Fast around to the west by 18.

461
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,798
- How far to land?
- About 126 feet.

462
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,349
If we're that near,
then why can't we see it?

463
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,873
It's underneath us.

464
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,076
Look at the sun.
Left is south, right is north.

465
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,313
I thought the sun rose in the east.

466
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,112
Is that right?
Wrong direction, turn around.

467
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,918
So we've been going the wrong way
for three days?

468
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,079
Don't blame me.
The sun only just came out.

469
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:48,596
At least we know it's wrong now.
Big Mouth, test the wind.

470
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,233
Sail with the wind!

471
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,112
Bring her round.

472
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,918
Look! The sun is going down.
It's not rising.

473
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,833
It's the wrong direction again!
Bring her round.

474
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,432
Here we go again!

475
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:22,708
