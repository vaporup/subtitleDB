1
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,353
Project A

2
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,759
Your recent operations
have been failures.

3
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,832
I have doubts about
your present proposal.

4
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,673
Governor, in my opinion,
these sea battles are risky.

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,832
Why not save all this precious
money and spend it on the police?

6
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,433
We can capture the pirates this time.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,948
According to your records,
this is what happened two years ago.

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,837
You couldn't even find
where the pirates were.

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,433
And with the wind...
two ships were lost.

10
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,114
- A sudden typhoon came!
- How do you explain last year?

11
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,275
You were so certain
that you could capture the pirates,

12
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,114
but you got lost in the sea
and ended up in Bangladesh.

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,715
You were almost starved to death.
Can you explain that?

14
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,953
- I was never good at geography.
- You've wasted most of the budget.

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,793
We've not had a pay rise
for two years because of this.

16
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,677
Do you know that my officers
are complaining?

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,879
That's your problem, it's not mine.

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,909
You'd better think again.
I'm against taking unnecessary risks.

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,872
And so am I.

20
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,352
All right, if you're confident
it'll work, then go ahead.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,114
Dragon! You're wanted immediately.

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,109
Dragon!

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,957
- Go get these papers signed.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,592
Morning.

25
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,193
Are you in a hurry?

26
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,955
Captain Chi, please sign this.

27
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,913
All this ammunition, is it necessary?
Is this another world war?

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,991
We need that much
to fight the pirates.

29
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,038
Aren't you aware that
we have to deal with street crime?

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,750
OK, you take all the ammunition,
we can still manage to do our jobs.

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,908
Corporal.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,639
Tell our men to practise running.

33
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,156
No shooting at criminals,
we'll run after them instead.

34
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,913
Does that satisfy you?

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,118
If you hit the target every time,

36
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,838
a bullet can kill one pirate,

37
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,877
and a cannonball can kill
a few dozen pirates.

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,235
Then you won't need
so much ammunition.

39
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,312
Captain Chi, if you don't want to
give it to me, just say so.

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,712
How dare you
talk to your superior like that?!

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,472
Look at yourself.

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,074
You coast guards
can't even stand correctly.

43
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,310
You've been at sea for too long.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,995
Do they ever teach you
what discipline is?

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,269
You may go now.

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,477
Once I sign this, I'll give it
to the armoury department.

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,877
Wait a second!

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,712
Lucky for you
you're not in my department. Dismiss.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,513
Are you writing to your mum?

50
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,318
Tell her not to worry,
we'll be back real soon.

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,232
- Don't forget your life jacket.
- I'll sleep in it.

52
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,913
Why are you all so sad?
Grin and bear it!

53
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,471
You all look so gloomy!
We're not dead yet.

54
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,153
The cops are watching us.
Show some spirit, can't you?

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,949
Dragon.

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,870
- Is everybody here?
- Are we leaving?

57
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,790
Sure. We're sailing tomorrow night.

58
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,918
Why have you got such long faces?
Waiter, beer for everyone!

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,994
Thank you, sir.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,552
It's very busy tonight.

61
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,514
Tzu, over here.

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,831
- Beer for everyone.
- You're late.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,151
Sit down here.
This is my girlfriend - Chu.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,550
- Waiter, here.
- Coming! OK.

65
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,038
You have to drink this.

66
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,187
Waiter.

67
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,190
- Who keeps the sea safe?
- The coast guard!

68
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,713
- Who's the toughest?
- Coast guard!

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,119
It's them again.

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,954
Drink to the greatest!

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,430
Don't your customers get served?

72
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,512
- They're going to die.
- Don't be like that.

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,238
- What did you say?
- You're going to die!

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,437
- Forget it.
- I'm coming.

75
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,795
- Hurry.
- Your order, please?

76
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,189
- Beer.
- Four beers.

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,877
- May I join in?
- Winnie. Sit down.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,389
Are they celebrating something?

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,757
They're celebrating going to capture
the pirates. They may not come back.

80
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,514
A glass of milk, OK?

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,274
- Not milk. I'll buy you a beer.
- All right, then.

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,033
No wonder we don't get a pay rise.

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,237
These bums waste good money
chasing after pirates.

84
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,110
Actually, they couldn't even
locate where the pirates were.

85
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,872
Come on, don't get upset.

86
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,031
Even now, they have no idea
where the pirates are.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,916
- Say that again!
- No trouble. Stay calm.

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,757
Tai-po, get the check.

89
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,798
Get the check.

90
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,399
Sha, taking a vacation soon?

91
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,675
- That's right.
- Are you going home?

92
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,749
To Canton.

93
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,509
The sea's full of pirates,
don't take a boat.

94
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:34,035
- How can he get there, then?
- He can always walk.

95
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,475
Do you feel safe
walking on the road?

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,351
Mind your own business.

97
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,435
Ladies and gentlemen, we admit the
sea is not safe now and we apologise.

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,869
My uncle is coming to Hong Kong and
he's walking all the way from Canton.

99
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,029
But he's blind,
how can he manage it?

100
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,031
But his ears are very good.

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,269
When he hears someone
selling cookies...

102
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,793
He's reached Yuen Long!

103
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,315
- When he can smell roast goose...
- He's in Shen Jang!

104
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,709
- And when he can hear whistles?
- Whistles.

105
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,517
He's in Hong Kong Island!

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,274
That's right.
Even children know this song.

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,074
One, two, three, four,
A, B, C, D

108
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,151
The cops whistle
when the criminals run away

109
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,470
Whistle...

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,197
The cops whistle
when the criminals run away

111
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,315
The cops whistle
when the criminals...

112
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,230
- Whistle...
- Bastard!

113
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,119
Easy!

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,959
No fighting!

115
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,310
Stop it. Stop fighting.
Do you hear me? Stop it.

116
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,156
Come on.
Can nobody take a joke today?

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,476
We're sorry.
Let's toast to friendship.

118
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,995
Let's not fight each other.

119
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,752
- Why are you so rude?
- Shut up!

120
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,910
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

121
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,394
- Are you OK?
- Are you all right?

122
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,913
I'm OK.

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,351
I spilt some beer,
but I've made my toast so no matter.

124
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,793
Let's go.

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,911
You dirtied my best suit.

126
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,233
- I apologise.
- But I don't forgive you.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,312
You have two choices, pal.
You can say you are sorry or...

128
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,389
I won't say sorry.
I choose the second one.

129
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,349
Get him.

130
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,677
Get the truncheon.

131
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,035
- We're all friends, aren't we?
- Not any more.

132
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,240
- Come on.
- You come on!

133
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,469
I'll give him a mouthful.
Where is he?

134
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,392
What are they doing?

135
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,000
The cops are fighting
with the coast guards.

136
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,794
This one first.

137
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,833
Stop fighting.

138
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,590
Stop this at once. Police!

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,149
We're all for law and order here!

140
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,633
I'm going to get you.

141
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,990
I'll get back to you later.

142
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,352
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

143
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,077
Why did you hit me?!

144
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,998
I'll get him, be sure of that!

145
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,470
221! I've got your number.
I'll give you all this spaghetti!

146
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,870
- 221!
- I'm here. What is it?

147
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,668
Nothing.

148
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,796
You are supposed to represent
law and order. Arrest them.

149
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,313
Come on, get up.

150
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,558
Uncle.

151
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,716
Get yourself out of here.

152
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,831
You know we're sailing tomorrow,
you really can't detain my men.

153
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,477
Only some are detained.

154
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,710
You have all my navigators locked up.

155
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,109
Just because
you don't want us to sail.

156
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,792
I informed the governor.

157
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,076
I suppose you informed him
your nephew started it.

158
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,956
Can you let them go now?
My thanks to the captain.

159
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,753
All right.

160
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,076
I want no more trouble.

161
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,035
- Father.
- Go home.

162
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,312
Admiral, sir.

163
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,316
Sorry about the trouble we caused.

164
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,075
Don't apologise. If I was in your
position, I'd beat them to hell.

165
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,835
I never could stand
the smell of cops.

166
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,477
Get out of here!

167
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,788
Fall in.

168
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,230
Our mission
is to capture those pirates.

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,990
When you see them,
what should you do?

170
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,990
We will never let them go.

171
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,831
What if you are wounded?

172
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,910
We won't feel the pain.

173
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,751
And when you're captured?

174
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,869
Well?

175
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,918
What is it, then?

176
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,552
Guard, come here.

177
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,198
Talk...

178
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,398
Talk or you'll be shot dead.

179
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,558
Good. Keep silent if you're captured.
Dismiss.

180
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,996
Ready for inspection.

181
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,355
Listen up, boys.

182
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,956
If you can fight the pirates
like you fought the police,

183
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,837
then you're sure to win.

184
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,477
We're sure to win.

185
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,991
We built five ships,
why are there only three?

186
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,196
Governor, the other two
are submerged.

187
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,469
I thought we couldn't see them
because they were submarines!

188
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,669
Three ships will be too crowded.

189
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,434
They may be overcrowded,
but it shouldn't be a problem.

190
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,794
They won't be crowded when returning.

191
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,994
Ready.

192
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,038
What's that?

193
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,235
Put the fire out.

194
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,957
- Two ships are on fire.
- Then get water. Get water!

195
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,115
Those pirates!

196
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,908
I'll arrange for a ship
to take you to Vietnam.

197
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,355
Don't worry about it,
I know what to do.

198
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,000
Excuse me, I have some business now.

199
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,034
Chiang, the cops are looking for you.
You keep out of trouble.

200
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,636
Thanks to your information,
we've blown up their ships.

201
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,471
They're better off this way.

202
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,438
If you had blown them up at sea,
they would have had to swim home.

203
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,830
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.

204
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,515
All my ships travel safely now
thanks to San-po's protection.

205
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,272
I should really thank him.

206
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,717
I'm happy to hear you say that.
San-po would like a favour from you.

207
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,951
He needs 100 rifles like this.

208
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,398
- I'll see you get paid well for it.
- Sure, I know what to do.

209
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,239
Cho-kou...

210
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,756
it won't be a problem.

211
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,269
We're counting on you. Bye now.

212
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,433
Take care.

213
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,509
But Boss, those are police rifles.
Where can we get that many?

214
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:35,910
It'll be tough,
but we'll manage it.

215
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,390
- We need a good man for the job.
- What about Chiang?

216
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,387
No. He's a wanted man now.

217
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,673
Contact Fei.

218
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,230
- Are you sure? He's expensive.
- Don't worry about it.

219
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,317
We can always kill him afterwards.

220
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,269
West. Full house.

221
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,749
On what?

222
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,512
- On a West.
- Where did you get that?!

223
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,999
He threw away a Circle.

224
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,548
You're blind.
The West was discarded ages ago.

225
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,835
- Now what?
- You should be fined.

226
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,717
- Pay the fine.
- Pay up.

227
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,351
- I'm finished.
- Fine.

228
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,989
- We need one more player.
- I'll join you.

229
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,432
"Ten Cent Stake"

230
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,628
"One Dollar Stake"

231
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,387
- Banker.
- Coming.

232
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,039
- Price it.
- Fei, I'll make it quick.

233
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,190
Can you take a look at this?

234
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,387
A broken rusty watch.
Three dollars.

235
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,117
It's Fei's watch.

236
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,439
You can be sure it's real gold.
100 dollars.

237
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,794
Yes.

238
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,919
- Hold on.
- No!

239
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,068
Not this one.

240
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,397
- 40,000.
- Wait.

241
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,278
It's time we saw
the colour of your money.

242
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,068
- Place your bets. Today is my day.
- Nothing I can do.

243
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,309
Can't you be more careful?

244
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,877
Eight Circles.

245
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,950
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, Fei.

246
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,393
Your turn.

247
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,429
Six Sticks.

248
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,037
You're not going to win this game.

249
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,958
- 20,000 thrown away.
- No. Honestly.

250
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,509
Are you accusing me of being blind?
Am I right?

251
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,114
- He discarded Five Circles.
- Right.

252
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,998
- Do you believe me now?
- No. Will you swear to it?

253
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,674
Sure. I will swear to it.
Everybody, on my life I swear

254
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:46,069
I've just discarded Five Circles.
I didn't throw away 20,000.

255
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,635
- Five Circles?
- That's right.

256
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,755
Let's see.

257
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,871
I won!

258
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,472
I won this game.

259
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,476
- You are good.
- Thank you.

260
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,796
Come on, give me my money.

261
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,633
- That's it.
- Hold it! I saw you cheating.

262
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,392
I saw you cheating.

263
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,558
Wait.

264
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,512
Sorry.

265
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,671
Don't worry. It's my turn now.

266
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,310
- Get up.
- Please, no!

267
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,878
What's the hurry?
Maybe I can win again.

268
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,472
It's my turn now.

269
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,230
It's a full house.
Nobody can argue with this.

270
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,513
Hello, Fei.

271
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,310
We want a favour from you.

272
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,157
Do you know how much money
I was going to win?

273
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,516
This is my new plan
for capturing the pirates.

274
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,271
It's called Project A.

275
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,068
First of all,
we need to buy new ships.

276
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,309
Go home and get some rest.

277
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,073
I'm not in the least bit tired.

278
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,798
Secondly, we need more new recruits.

279
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,030
Let me tell you,
your men have disappointed me a lot.

280
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,271
I'm turning them over to Captain Chi
for some hard training.

281
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,269
Now you're in charge of fundraising.

282
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,432
A British ship has been sent
to capture the pirates.

283
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,875
I want you to get out now!

284
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,998
- Change into these uniforms.
- Why?

285
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,832
Captain Chi's orders.

286
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,715
These are police uniforms.

287
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,155
- Are you kidding?
- The governor disbanded our squad.

288
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,157
I don't care what I wear,
as long as I still get paid.

289
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,515
It's better than fighting
the pirates.

290
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,790
Congratulations.
Congratulations on your new status.

291
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,075
Now you don't need to endure
the hardship of the sea.

292
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,517
- And you, sir?
- Me?

293
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,152
Didn't you hear about my promotion
to chairman of fundraising?

294
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,999
- What exactly is that?
- Go change your uniforms. Come on.

295
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,153
Change uniforms at once.

296
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,392
That's my last order.

297
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,116
I think it's time to report in.

298
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,873
Go on.

299
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,715
Reporting for duty, Captain Chi.

300
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,075
From the coast guards. Sergeant Ma?

301
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,355
We've been disbanded, sir.

302
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,634
I don't care what
you did in the coast guards,

303
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,311
you're in the police now.

304
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,109
When you answer an officer
in this force, answer yes or no.

305
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,398
Just look at you.

306
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,357
You call that attention?

307
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,596
I'll teach you how to stand.

308
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,269
Stand to attention.
Stand up, chest out, stomach in.

309
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,157
From the nose to the toes,
there's a straight line.

310
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,713
Is your number 213? Answer me.

311
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,278
Do you think you're stupid?
Answer me!

312
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,951
Not bad at all.

313
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,517
- Captain Chi.
- Just in time. Meet Sergeant Ma.

314
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:43,672
This is our new inspector, Hong Tin-tzu.

315
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,512
Inspector Hong
is an excellent officer.

316
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,231
He'll be your squad leader and train
you to be a Special Mission squad.

317
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,877
You may leave. Dismiss.

318
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,479
Sergeant.

319
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,913
For the last time,
what is the correct salute?

320
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,988
We're in trouble.

321
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,115
Start training them tomorrow.

322
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,078
If you want them to listen to you,
be sure to give them a hard time.

323
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,755
Come on, fall in.

324
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,238
You, come here.

325
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,157
Salute, Private.

326
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,036
Stand up, chest out, stomach in.

327
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,472
Do it 500 times.

328
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,949
I don't care how sloppy
you were before,

329
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,837
you're in the police now.

330
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,711
- As a policeman you have to be fit.
- Look at that chick over there.

331
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,758
- She's got a crazy figure!
- She's a bit of all right.

332
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,833
209 and 214, come out here.

333
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,517
What were you talking about?

334
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,828
- He said look at that chick.
- He said she had a crazy figure.

335
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Go repeat it 500 times.

336
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,115
1000!

337
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,518
- Look at that chick over there.
- She's got a crazy figure.

338
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,750
- Look at that chick over there...
- She's got a crazy figure.

339
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,998
Who was laughing?

340
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,432
- It was me, sir.
- Here.

341
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,068
- Laughing on parade.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
- Were you the only one laughing?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,792
- Do you know the punishment for it?
- To laugh 1,000 times.

344
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,632
Shoot him dead.

345
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,510
- Look at that chick there.
- She's got a crazy figure.

346
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,636
- Look at that chick there.
- She's got a crazy figure...

347
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,277
Sir, we've finished.
He fainted before the execution.

348
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,395
Then he can clean the toilets.

349
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,195
Look at that chick.
She's got a crazy figure.

350
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,038
Look at that chick.
She's got a crazy figure.

351
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,587
Look at that chick. She got a...

352
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,277
What's up?

353
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,827
That was some dream.
I hit Tzu really hard.

354
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,952
Let me sleep!

355
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,114
- Why is there an emergency call now?
- There must be an emergency.

356
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,032
- Nonsense.
- Put on your uniforms. Quick.

357
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,997
You drank too much soup last night
so you need the toilet now.

358
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,199
Sergeant.

359
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,031
Take them to the toilets
and then dismiss them.

360
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,394
Stand by. Into attack. Forward.

361
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,836
In our squad, speed is essential.

362
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,957
It's very simple.
You have ten seconds. Stand by.

363
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,553
Go.

364
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,837
One, two, three,

365
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,387
four, five, six,

366
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,075
seven, eight, nine, ten.

367
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,758
You must understand that I'm training
you to be alert day and night.

368
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,354
- OK, my turn.
- Do you have ten seconds, too?

369
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,509
Instructors are allowed 45 seconds.

370
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,555
Give me a water ladle.

371
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,239
Give me one. Hurry!

372
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,278
Give it to him.

373
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,476
That's an order.

374
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,395
We might have to use some
deadly weapons on our missions.

375
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,272
This is the latest hand grenade.
You might not know it.

376
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,237
I will give a demonstration.

377
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,349
Pull the pin out
and throw it within ten seconds.

378
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,596
Bang! It's just exploded.
Got it, boys?

379
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,392
Big Mouth, get the grenade.

380
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,479
- Did you switch them?
- Yes.

381
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,074
Sergeant,
did I say you were outstanding?

382
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,034
Step back in line.

383
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,238
Let's take turns at throwing it.
Sergeant, you.

384
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,198
- Sir, he doesn't know how to use it.
- Yes, I do.

385
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,837
Can you show us again, sir?

386
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,115
OK. Watch carefully this time.

387
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,074
Firstly...

388
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,755
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- No. But that's a real grenade.

389
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,553
Pull the pin. This time I'll throw
it towards you. So watch out.

390
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,480
Quick! It's a real grenade. Look out!

391
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,752
Squad, sit down.

392
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,839
We've been given orders
to arrest Chiang.

393
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,628
We've heard that
he's hiding in the Hoover Club.

394
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,678
One problem is that
important people use this club.

395
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:17,199
We must arrest Chiang discreetly and
not disturb the members in the club.

396
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,156
Do you all understand?

397
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,028
Understood, sir.

398
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,318
I can't do it alone. I'll let you
know when I've made my mind up.

399
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,949
- You better make it quick.
- The quicker the better.

400
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,077
Don't cause a disturbance
until we find Chiang.

401
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,751
We all know what to do.

402
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,549
You cover here. Come on.

403
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,231
Membership cards, please.

404
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,512
Police.

405
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,953
Can I help?

406
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,790
That's not a membership card.

407
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,556
We suspect you're hiding
an escaped criminal.

408
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,798
Wait there.

409
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,075
He said our members
are rich and famous people.

410
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,751
There are no criminals here.

411
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,310
- Front door's there.
- Can't we come in for a drink?

412
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,032
No disrespect,
but how much do you earn a month?

413
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,112
Even a glass might be worth more
than your savings.

414
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,272
Stop!

415
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,075
I said stop.

416
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:00,959
- Calm down.
- He was trying to tip them off.

417
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,675
- Lucky I didn't break any glasses.
- Do you know who my boss is?!

418
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,957
- I don't need to know.
- We want to have a look around.

419
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,553
Fine.

420
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,153
Take a look.
Leave when you've finished.

421
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,830
You've seen everything.
That's the manager's office.

422
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,632
Stop! Come here.

423
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,347
It's the cops.

424
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,233
Chiang, coming out quietly?

425
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,550
All the bad guys are here.
That'll save me some work.

426
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,028
We're arresting you
for murder and drug trafficking.

427
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,230
And for insulting a policeman.

428
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,232
This is the warrant.

429
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,192
You know the charges!

430
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,915
We've come for an arrest,
not a fight.

431
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,199
Beat him up!

432
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,151
- You can't go up.
- Get lost!

433
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,878
Speak Chinese!

434
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,240
You have to pay
for all the damage here.

435
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,348
Get him.

436
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,355
- Keep out of sight.
- Go on.

437
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,391
Look at this mess!

438
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:15,269
Stop it. I said stop it.

439
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,873
- Captain.
- Do you have a warrant for this?

440
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,235
- No.
- Sergeant Ma.

441
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,632
We were informed
the murderer Chiang was here.

442
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,277
- So where is he?
- Upstairs.

443
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,239
How dare you!
You're trespassing on my property.

444
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,789
Captain, your men
should join a demolition squad.

445
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,597
Do you know what you're doing?

446
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,911
You are more experienced than Tzu,
you should have known better.

447
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,711
- Uncle...
- That's enough.

448
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,396
- Sergeant, apologise to Mr Chou.
- To him? But we did nothing wrong!

449
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,393
They're hiding criminals
and have assaulted us. Apologise?!

450
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,791
Captain, I'll tell the governor that
you allowed these men to slander me.

451
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,431
Come back.

452
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,396
You'll see if it's slander.

453
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,072
I said apologise to Mr Chou.

454
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,989
There's a punishment
for disobeying an order.

455
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,637
So be it, then. I quit.

456
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,119
I am no longer a policeman.
No more orders.

457
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,599
How dare you!

458
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,628
Stop him.

459
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,518
Everyone stay where you are.

460
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,672
You take the credit.
I'm always the bad guy.

461
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,393
Dragon.

462
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,556
You almost hit my nose!

463
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,514
How are you?

464
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,036
You don't treat friends like this.

465
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,235
It's not my fault
if you have the hump.

466
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,989
Were you in the club?

467
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,867
When I saw you guys move in,
I knew something was in the air.

468
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,317
In this world of evils,
no man stands alone.

469
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,550
I won't join your thieving ways!

470
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,757
Don't mention that word. Since you
joined the force, I've gone straight.

471
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,876
How else could we be seen together?

472
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,677
I guess some
are delighted that you quit.

473
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,074
Why?

474
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,755
You want to get rid of the pirates,
but not everyone is like you.

475
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,751
- Really?
- Yes.

476
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,630
Why did your ships get blown up?
Someone betrayed you all.

477
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,472
- You're guessing.
- I'm not.

478
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,838
The pirates are getting rifles
from somebody inside your force.

479
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,070
News! Read all about it.

480
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,594
Pirate San-po strikes again.

481
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,432
Three dead, 24 injured.
Read all about it.

482
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,512
- Who'd sell to pirates?
- Why do you want to know?

483
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,114
I want to know
who would be so cold-blooded.

484
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,434
Thanks.

485
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,876
Why do you know so much?
Are you thinking of stealing them?

486
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,994
In life there are four
kinds of people.

487
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,436
I don't qualify as a rich man.
I don't like being poor.

488
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,318
The cops don't want me
so I have to be a thief.

489
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,072
As you're my friend,
I'll try to be a good thief.

490
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,878
In this rifle deal,
everyone is a bad guy.

491
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,268
You can get your man
and I'll get my money.

492
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,157
And we both win.

493
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:32,072
Tell me where.

494
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,112
At the jetty.

495
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,275
Are you ready?

496
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,637
Get them on board.

497
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,228
- The pier's moved!
- Get him up here.

498
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,389
- Quick!
- Someone's there!

499
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,472
It's me.

500
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,952
Do you know you're committing
a serious crime?

501
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,759
And selling arms
to the pirates is a crime.

502
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,876
- How shall we punish him?
- Chop off his head.

503
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,076
Yes! We'll chop his head off.

504
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,516
We're surrounded by water.
I can't find an axe.

505
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,195
So... we have to let them go.
We'll kick them in the water.

506
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,996
- Why didn't you jump?
- I can't swim.

507
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,875
- Really?
- I can't.

508
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,717
- Now what?
- What now?

509
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,358
Why can't you swim?

510
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,989
It's never too late to learn.
Give this to him.

511
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,512
Now swim and swim!

512
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,436
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

513
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,349
- Help! I can't swim!
- Let's go.

514
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,552
Help me!

515
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,713
Help me!

516
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,831
- What will you do with them?
- Find some buyers, of course.

517
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,275
Yeah, they'll make good money.

518
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,554
You're not going to sell
them to just anybody, are you?

519
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,077
- These are guns, not toys.
- Don't worry.

520
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,152
I'll sell them back to the army.
Are you happy now?

521
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,951
Then I'm glad I helped you.

522
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,512
What's that for?

523
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,556
We have to identify which log it is.

524
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:17,076
Remember, it's only
you and I in on this.

525
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,072
Have you finished, Fei? This way.

526
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,795
- Have you got the money?
- Here.

527
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,318
And the rifles?

528
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,798
I wouldn't keep rifles here.
Do you think I'm crazy?

529
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,717
Now, where are the rifles?

530
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,592
They're in the log yard.

531
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,155
I'll take you there in the morning.

532
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,074
- There's so many. Which one is it?
- Easy. I fixed a red cloth on it.

533
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,911
Right there, see?

534
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,230
- They all have a red cloth.
- Which one?

535
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,514
What now, Fei? Which one is it?

536
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,958
Looks like we'll have to turn
them all over.

537
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,793
OK, guys, get started.

538
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,032
Listen, Fei,
be smart with us. We can get rough.

539
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,913
Mind your manners.

540
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,273
You guys get soft
living the high life.

541
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,637
You double-crossed us.

542
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,753
Do you think I'm crazy?

543
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,400
Tell us right now or we'll kill you.

544
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,358
Everyone leave. This place
is closed to the public today.

545
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,679
Come on, split.

546
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,637
You sold us out to the cops.

547
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,918
It's not my day.

548
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,478
Why are you still here?

549
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,675
I'm an undertaker.

550
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,514
His father is going to die and he's
looking for a nice log for a coffin.

551
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,751
It's better to do it early.
This will make a nice one.

552
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,960
You're a good boy. But it's closed.
Come some other day.

553
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:13,916
All right, we're leaving now.

554
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,231
See you. Bye for now.

555
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,512
- There's a lot of cops.
- He won't get far.

556
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,556
We'll deal with him back in town.

557
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,152
Let's go.

558
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,552
Admiral, it's all clear.

559
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,349
Dragon said it's the log
without a red cloth. Find it.

560
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,512
- I'm sorry!
- What are you doing?

561
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,632
What? Wasn't Captain Chi going to
sell the rifles to the pirates?

562
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,313
No, he was collecting them
for the government.

563
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,197
- It's Fei.
- Womaniser!

564
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,635
If it wasn't for you,
they would never have found the guns.

565
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:01,438
How did you know the rifles
were there?

566
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,038
How did I know? I eavesdropped!

567
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,436
But they discovered me.

568
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,797
- What happened then?
- I was surrounded by 20 thugs.

569
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,632
- No other man can compete with me.
- So...

570
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:18,077
I jumped on one and kicked three!
There was only one fat guy left.

571
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,311
What a fight we had!

572
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,869
We were fighting for three minutes,
until I used this move.

573
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,592
Then he was defeated.

574
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,909
Then I told him
if the pirates got those rifles,

575
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,512
many kids would be killed.

576
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,748
That's right.

577
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,469
He decided to tell me
where the rifles were hidden.

578
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,516
Dragon, I think you're wonderful.

579
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,431
Traitor! So the price
for betrayal is one little kiss?

580
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:44,713
And nothing else!

581
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,628
- Look...
- I'll deal with you later.

582
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:54,878
Have you seen a fat guy?

583
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,349
A fat guy? He's gone that way.

584
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,197
Don't expect me to thank you.

585
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,391
You! I just heard his voice.

586
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,231
He's right there.

587
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,798
Many thanks.

588
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,072
Don't block my way.

589
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,434
Why are you chasing me?
Ask him where he's put the guns.

590
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:27,670
- Dragon.
- Let's go!

591
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,318
Get him.

592
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:47,878
Come on.

593
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:54,679
Where are the guns?

594
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,556
- Ask him.
- Talk!

595
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,713
- They're in the police station.
- What?!

596
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,596
Do you know how to handle that thing?

597
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:05,318
You conned me!
I thought you were a friend.

598
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,389
Double-crosser!

599
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,358
I was doing it for you.
How many times have I saved you?

600
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,952
- Never.
- Liar.

601
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,237
What about that axeman?
Who saved you then?

602
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,514
I don't remember that!

603
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,795
Bastard! I'll teach you a lesson!

604
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,110
- Let's go.
- Come on.

605
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,670
This way. Hurry, follow me.

606
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:46,195
There!

607
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,873
Cut them off.

608
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:59,958
- Wait! Where's Winnie?
- How do I know?

609
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,677
If you get away,
we'll meet at the usual place.

610
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,159
I can't walk.

611
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:07,878
Hold on.

612
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:10,313
They went that way.

613
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,715
Go on, jump.
It's not so high. I'll go first.

614
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:18,914
Jump, go on!

615
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,068
- Impossible!
- Don't be scared. I'll catch you.

616
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,552
If you don't jump,
you'll end up a gangster's moll.

617
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:30,907
Come on.

618
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,518
Hide in there.

619
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,188
Stop.

620
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,795
- Come on.
- My leg hurts!

621
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,268
You'll be all right. Quick.

622
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:52,998
Quick.

623
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,038
Watch out!

624
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,239
Run for it.

625
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:06,434
I'm up here!

626
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,068
Give me your hand.

627
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:16,719
Come on, run.

628
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:23,271
Just follow me.

629
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,677
It's easy, you see. See?

630
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,112
Come on.

631
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,358
- I'm still up here.
- You'll send me mad!

632
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,873
Can't you even jump?
