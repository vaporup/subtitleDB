1
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,234
That should hurt

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,501
Bring him back in 3 days

3
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,270
Yoo Oh-sung
Okay

4
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,278
No bath in the meantime

5
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,176
Okay thanks

6
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,282
Bye

8
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,991
Hi, there

9
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,296
Hi

10
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:16,100
I'd like to buy some food
for Alphonse

11
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:21,104
- You bought some the other day
- No, No

12
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,613
Seems that he's lost his appetite

13
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,311
So I'd like to try...

14
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,822
Try this

15
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,625
It's new on the market

16
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,076
Special Appearance by
Kong Hyung-jin

Produced by Park Hyung-jun

18
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,250
Still here?

19
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:11,853
Oh, I had to stop by that store

20
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,163
Why don't you get a hook?

21
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,865
This is the only workout I get

22
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,285
Alphonse...

23
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,489
- Isn't that a writer's name?
- Yeah

24
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,092
I thought so

25
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,091
So many stars tonight

26
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,790
Cause it rained earlier

27
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:52,596
- You know a lot about stars?
- A little bit

28
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,617
What about constellations?

29
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,920
A little bit

30
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,990
Directed by Jang Hyung-ik

31
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,721
I'm a Capricorn

32
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,430
You know where that is?

33
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,934
It's not too clear tonight

34
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,341
There

35
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,743
To the right of the polestar

36
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,752
BYUL

37
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,966
How was your day?

38
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,907
The 74th time I saw her

39
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,710
She's a Capricorn

40
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,422
Alphonse!
Why don't you get sick?

41
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,625
You're way too healthy

42
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:07,536
So-ha
Mommy yelled at you again?

43
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,735
- You're a liar, Young-woo
- Why?

44
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,439
She says stars don't talk
and sing to one another

45
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,148
It's all a lie

46
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:24,147
That's not true

47
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,157
Let me show you

48
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:33,655
Come on, sit on my lap.
Stop crying

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,461
Now look

50
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,768
I don't see anything

51
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:43,069
No? Let me adjust it.
Try again

52
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,582
Where are the stars?
Liar!

53
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,995
Alphonse

54
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,928
Hey, Young-woo

55
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,963
I'm asking her out today.
How do I look?

56
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,731
Looking good... like a player

57
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,646
You've got no taste whatsoever.
Stay single forever

58
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,417
Young-woo, congratulations!

59
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,421
Going to the Equipment Fair abroad
as the employee of the year

60
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,216
- For real?
- Congratulations

61
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,724
Thank you.
Thanks

62
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,021
- Congratulations
- Thank you

63
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,325
Don't give it away this time

64
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,124
I won't

65
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,948
[Purun Animal Clinic]

66
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,558
Need more dog food?

67
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:50,264
- No
- I got it, you came for the doctor

68
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,766
No

69
00:07:54,807 --> 00:08:00,370
No, really, I was just
looking at that puppy

70
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,687
Lie, and misfortune finds you

71
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,693
God, what have I done?

72
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,195
So sorry

73
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,698
I didn't see you there

74
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,200
Feels cool, though.
Oh boy

75
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,315
Come on, sit over there and
dry yourself off

76
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,510
Let me get you a towel

77
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:47,722
Sit here
Let me get you a towel

78
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,326
Alphonse, how are you?

79
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,836
Hey there

80
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh... hi

81
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:10,542
My mother sent me
these sweet potatoes

82
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,250
Move over, mutt

83
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,356
Try some

84
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,858
- Help yourself
- Alphonse

85
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,566
Come on, Miss. Vet

86
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:36,666
These are good for your system

87
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,277
Far better than ice cream.
Here you go

88
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:44,176
Boy, he licked it.
You want some, too?

89
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,082
Mr.

90
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,778
Miss. Vet

91
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,486
A beautiful Saturday afternoon

92
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,687
and you all don't have dates?

93
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,696
- How pathetic is that?
- Hello?

94
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,802
Hi there

95
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,100
Yeah, I'm coming
Excuse me

96
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,403
What a good picture!

97
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,718
Go out on a date or something

98
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,823
I don't date customers

99
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:44,006
What happened to your hand?

100
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,675
Got scratched by a dog

101
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,843
Too bad

102
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,249
Run over by a car...

103
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,650
he was writhing in pain

104
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,798
- Got a girl friend?
- What?

105
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,603
No, I don't

106
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,106
Really, no girlfriend

107
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,716
Him

108
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,821
I was talking about him

109
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:28,144
Stop smirking, the air's really
thick around here

110
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,941
Now if...

111
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,142
A girl asked if I had a girlfriend.
How should I interpret that?

112
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,154
- Who, Miss. Doggy?
- A veterinarian!

113
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,949
Keep it down

114
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,058
Why don't you go?

115
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,754
I did my tour of duty last year, sir

116
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,764
Wow, a dimwit remembers

117
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,765
Hey... hey! Come here

118
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,848
Alphonse,
when will you get sick?

119
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,950
You got all your vaccinations

120
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,251
You wouldn't mind one more,
would you?

121
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,756
Alphonse?

122
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,527
Alphonse?

123
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,878
Alphon... Hey!

124
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,986
Alphonse, hang in there.
We're almost there

125
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,685
We're almost there, don't worry

126
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,601
Alphonse... Alphonse

127
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,510
- I put him under
- Poor boy

128
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,809
The wounds are pretty bad

129
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,582
Got a problem?

130
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,976
Thanks

131
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,982
Don't mention it,
Alphonse is my favorite customer

132
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,495
I wouldn't worry

133
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,655
He'll be up and and running soon

134
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:46,994
Alphonse, when you get better
go get him good, okay?

135
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,954
They'd send a single guy, right?

136
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,147
Not a man with a family?

137
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,554
What's up with you guys?

138
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,456
It's beautiful out there

139
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,960
You volunteer then

140
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,259
Hell no, I'd rather quit

141
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,665
Hey, employee of the year

142
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,665
- We should celebrate tonight
- Not tonight

143
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,172
Alphonse is sick at the hospital

144
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,175
You blow us off over that mutt?

145
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,814
Let's go guys, it's on me

146
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,986
Alphonse, does it hurt a lot?

147
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,096
He's bad, isn't he?

148
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,688
He told you to get sick everyday

149
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,096
Poor Alphonse...
It's all his fault

150
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,403
- Hi
- Hi

151
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,511
- How's Alphonse?
- A lot better

152
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,305
Hey, So-ha

153
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,905
Shame on you!
He's sick because of you

154
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,818
- What?
- You told him to get sick!

155
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,715
Your mom's looking for you
I'll be back

156
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,418
You can take him home now

157
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:23,728
- What?
- Take Alphonse home

158
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,230
No, he's still seems in pain

159
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,539
But he...

160
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,047
And the wounds haven't healed yet

161
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:49,359
Well... I guess he's all right

162
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,557
Let's go home, Alphonse
You are all better now

163
00:18:58,704 --> 00:18:59,864
Alphonse

164
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,967
Consider it an honor

165
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,374
You'll get a private vet...

166
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:12,477
And I'll get a wife

167
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:21,482
Are you up for a stroll?

168
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,994
Concert, movie, play...

169
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,001
Got everything planned out, huh?

170
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:38,804
Good luck.
Let me see you get married

171
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,110
Yes, Sir

172
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,813
What a thorough plan

173
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,120
If this doesn't work, give up

174
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,245
Why?

175
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,724
You think she hits on you

176
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,828
to sell some dog food?

177
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,328
She might be a gold-digger

178
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,198
Hi there

179
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,996
Hi

180
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,016
What do you want?

181
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,377
I was wondering...

182
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,879
- Are you an art lover?
- What?

183
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:43,484
Concerts, plays, movies...
You like them?

184
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:48,190
- I do
- What's your favorite?

185
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,198
All of them

186
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,297
If you have to choose one?

187
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,100
Plays...

188
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,104
Concerts...

189
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,709
movies...

190
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,613
Been a while since I saw a play

191
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
There!

192
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,023
That's good

193
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,118
I happen to have tickets for a play

194
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:36,244
Are you asking me out?

195
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,744
I'll think about it

196
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:32,848
Okay... that's the way it is

197
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,642
Wait!

198
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,859
Are you her next of kin?

199
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,762
- What?
- You reek of liquor

200
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,074
Anything wrong, officer?

201
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,979
She's in a coma.
Better for you if she dies

202
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,382
What are you talking about?

203
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,084
You drove drunk, bastard!

204
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,087
Sorry

205
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,386
But it wasn't me

206
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,634
It was the car ahead of me

207
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,466
Is that right?
Give me its plate number

208
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,346
Don't know?

209
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:09,211
You've got to believe me

210
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,018
Can't you see?

211
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,320
By the way...

212
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,235
I'm starving

213
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,870
What do you feel like?

214
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,341
Stop being a pig, man.
Let's go

215
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,841
Now!

216
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,453
Alphonse

217
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:49,659
Eat, he'll be home soon.
Come on, eat

218
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:57,657
Aren't you gonna eat?

219
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,766
You might die

220
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,373
Let me out of here, pig!

221
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,237
My father won't tolerate this

222
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,277
- Shut up punk!
- Fuck you

223
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,379
I am going to tell
everything to my pop

224
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,378
My father will kill you!

225
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,478
Young-woo

226
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,345
Hey

227
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,880
I can't believe you did it, man

228
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,396
I didn't

229
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,693
Suits at work are freaking out
over this whole thing...

230
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,395
swearing to have
you shipped off to the boondocks

231
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,803
But don't worry, I won't let them

232
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,506
What will you get for this?

233
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,711
I didn't do it!

234
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,907
Of course, I believe you

235
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,317
Did that vet show up?

236
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,820
What'd I say?
She's been toying with you

237
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,428
Forget that broad

238
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,040
When'd you become an orphan?

239
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,943
When I was little

240
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,542
Must've been tough

241
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,650
No, it was okay

242
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,258
You got some money saved up?

243
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:36,062
Strike a deal with the victim's family

244
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,066
I didn't do it!

245
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,864
Still!

246
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,371
- Was it you?
- You son of a bitch!

247
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,873
- Cool it, guys
- Hey!

248
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,078
I didn't do it!

249
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,178
It wasn't me!

250
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,186
I simply took her to the hospital!

251
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,290
I didn't do it!

252
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,399
Let go!

253
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,005
Let go of me!

254
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,501
What happened to him?

255
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,675
They just radioed in
they'd busted the real guy

256
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:24,474
Yeah?

257
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,121
I'd like to go to the Fair

258
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:36,421
on behalf of Young-woo

259
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,620
I'll wait for your approval.
It's for only a few months

260
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,729
No volunteers?

261
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:47,031
You want me to go?

262
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,638
I'll go

263
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:54,040
You've been with us
for only 3 months

264
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,941
3 months and 3 days

265
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:03,543
Poke your nose where it belongs.
Sit down

266
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:04,746
Yes, sir

267
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,550
Who's going?

268
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:14,055
What are you worried about?

269
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,157
A black sheep...
You know who that is

270
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,670
We've all agreed on it

271
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,569
Unbelievable!

272
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,767
He messes up once

273
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,571
and you try to get rid of him?

274
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,373
Why don't you go then?

275
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,176
Stay out of this, okay?

276
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,875
Keep quiet

277
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,391
Justice never loses

278
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,487
Put it all behind you

279
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,691
Life has weird twists

280
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,000
Sorry I've created a fuss

281
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,307
Words won't do

282
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,503
Easy on him, guys

283
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,006
Young-woo,
don't let them twist your arm

284
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,409
You didn't do anything wrong

285
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,418
Shut up and sit!

286
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,221
Quiet!

287
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,325
You've got nothing but big mouths

288
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,520
I will go

289
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:20,025
Nobody on earth is your friend

290
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,530
It's rough out there

291
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,796
and you give in so easily

292
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,806
Just for a few months

293
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,503
I'll send you a replacement soon

294
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,508
No

295
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,712
You don't have to

296
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,992
Let's go

297
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,827
Damn!

298
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,125
I look worse than a grandpa

299
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,531
Who'd think of my as my age

300
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,949
How's it going?

301
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,951
You're finally here

302
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,353
So glad to see a human up here

303
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:11,066
And a dog!
Is this my day or what!

304
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,964
Let's drink

305
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,372
To console you on your life
in these boonies

306
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,172
No, congratulate me

307
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:27,173
- Congratulate you?
- Right

308
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,580
Want me to congratulate you

309
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:35,180
on coming to hell?

310
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,792
Well then...

311
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,897
- Whatever... Cheers
- Cheers

312
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:51,306
Congratulate you... well alright

313
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,364
Feels like you're out here

314
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,412
on a picnic, doesn't it?

315
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,812
I felt the same at first

316
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:05,321
Give it a week, dude
You'll be talking to the walls

317
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,623
I might live here forever

318
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:18,627
What? Didn't you just hear me?
This is hell

319
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,327
Have you been to hell?

320
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,735
Look at what we're eating, dude

321
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:23,862
You think this is human food?

322
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,136
This is considered a feast here.
Egg roll I made for you!

323
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,440
What are you,
the god of the mountains?

324
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,048
Let me tell you

325
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,650
I no longer remember

326
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,776
what chicks look like

327
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,515
- It's getting cold
- Eat then

328
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,255
This is cold?

329
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,954
I almost burnt my tongue off!

330
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,862
Shake a leg

331
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,870
That's GukMang Peak

332
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,965
It's breath-taking, isn't it?

333
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,374
So freaking beautiful!

334
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,673
Come on, Young woo

335
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,078
It's the same machine

336
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,378
we have at headquarters

337
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,779
This one's ok

338
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,584
Don't ask me why they don't
make it auto-controlled

339
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,192
This is a troublemaker

340
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,387
A pain in the ass

341
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,191
This one's good

342
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:29,969
Alphonse!

343
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,827
Here comes Jin-soo!

344
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,740
- How much?
- 5 bucks

345
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:17,452
- Great hairdo, babe
- You like it?

346
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,818
- I'll drop by later
- I'll be waiting for you

347
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,049
Okay, Ok

348
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:31,567
[Hambaek Clinic]

349
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:40,067
Hey there
Where's nurse Kim?

350
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,678
Missed me?

351
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,677
Where does it hurt this time?

352
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,983
I'll be sick in 10 minutes.
Give me some medicine

353
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,984
This is no pharmacy

354
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,180
What are you, blind?

355
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,791
I know, but I am patient

356
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,189
What kind of nurse are you,
treating patients like dirt?

357
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,920
You don't look sick

358
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,055
Doc, stop this Nightingale!

359
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,832
- Eat well
- Okay

360
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,732
- You can go now
- Thanks, doctor

361
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,835
How are you, Doc?

362
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,445
Good, you?

363
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,644
Been good too. It's getting quite
cold up there, though

364
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,241
- It feels like winter in the mornings
- Always eat 3 meals a day

365
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,047
With good food

366
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:28,454
Hold on, let me say goodbye to him.
She hates me

367
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,150
Take care, Doc.

368
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,756
See you

369
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,364
Time for your medicine, doctor

370
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,266
I take it all the time.
One miss won't kill me

371
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,667
Doctor

372
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,456
Here...

373
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,027
I've brought this for your wife

374
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,786
Awfully nice of you.
Thank you

375
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:12,198
You saved my son's life.
This is nothing

376
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,908
Try this

377
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,011
A mother of my former patient

378
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:32,115
Brought this for you

379
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,120
You're so blessed

380
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,830
Not loved by her husband

381
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,423
I'm the least blessed

382
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,332
You save everyone's life

383
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:53,341
- But not mine
- Stop it

384
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,244
It's true, though

385
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:08,655
Lately, I keep seeing his face

386
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,657
You're at it again

387
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,661
I don't wanna hear it

388
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,661
Why can't you let it go?

389
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,769
Stop talking about him

390
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,015
Pretty good

391
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,983
Who taught you to cook?
Your mom?

392
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,386
Why couldn't God give me
a mom like yours?

393
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,483
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise

394
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,629
He'll give me a good wife

395
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,394
I wonder if my angel in white
is a good cook

396
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:55,394
Are you listening to me?

397
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,006
There's this doctor in the village

398
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:01,407
who's like a god-sent man

399
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,809
A living legend...

400
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,916
Hippocrates!

401
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,413
That's what they call him

402
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,064
Hi

403
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,961
- Just got off of work?
- Right

404
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,869
- How's Alphonse?
- Couldn't be better

405
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,148
God, it's all mildewed

406
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:57,719
You like it here, don't you?

407
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,020
I do

408
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,831
"I do"

409
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,225
Don't you miss anybody?

410
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,239
Family, friends, or a girlfriend?
