1
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,028
Wow!

2
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:35,538
That's just what I thought

3
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:39,543
Just a matter of time.
Everyone goes nuts here

4
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,128
Wow!

5
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:54,482
Wow!

6
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,220
Oh... No!

7
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:33,891
You saw it, didn't you?

8
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:35,886
Here

9
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,297
You live with Alphonse, don't you?

10
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:46,397
Said he'd never come back

11
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:22,205
When you shower,
don't miss a spot

12
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:29,111
Fabulous!

13
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:33,911
Come on, Young-woo.
Shower when you can

14
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:37,114
Hurry up!

15
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,421
Scrub every part of the body...

16
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:47,625
Come on, hurry.
Before the rain stops

17
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:05,239
Aren't you sick of gazing at them?

18
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:09,151
Visibility is better after the rain

19
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,357
What's the point?

20
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:15,257
It's just a hobby

21
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,958
Oh, a hobby... Gotta take a piss

22
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:25,671
You got a lot of hobbies, huh?

23
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:31,573
Looking at stars... following
and yelling at a jet, going crazy...

24
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:37,550
Did you see that!
My pants!

25
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,204
Is it the antler of a deer?

26
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:02,601
No, it's not

27
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,630
So chilly!

28
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:36,003
Get away, you bad boy.
You do nothing but eat

29
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,145
What are you doing?

30
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,146
I found it in the storage

31
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:45,251
Don't bother

32
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,047
- We've got an electric stove
- Why not?

33
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:50,952
It goes well with the place

34
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,048
We can make tea, too

35
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,455
Make tea?

36
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,859
You are serious about
living here, aren't you?

37
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,555
Yeah, yeah, bury your bones here

38
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,365
When the winter's over,
I'm out of here

39
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,869
shouting hooray

40
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,883
It's not something new

41
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,783
Take a look

42
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,089
It sure looks different today

43
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:41,503
When familiar things look different,
they say it's time

44
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:47,504
How much time do I have left?

45
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,713
How much more do you want?

46
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:01,423
Wish I could see him before I die

47
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:07,032
It's so cold out there
I wonder where he...

48
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,634
Stop it

49
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,638
Let's drop it, okay?

50
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,534
I can't

51
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:19,941
You know what?

52
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,248
That's what got you sick!

53
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,344
I miss him so much

54
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,157
If only I could see him once

55
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:36,960
We've been good all our lives

56
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:41,165
Why do we have to suffer?

57
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:48,005
You're not sick, but senile!

58
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:06,788
Honey, I can't find him

59
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,689
Keep looking

60
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,992
No sign of him!
Come help me find him

61
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:15,600
Can't you see the line?
I can't leave now

62
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,497
Our son is more important!

63
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,818
You didn't even try

64
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,621
I pity you for not knowing...

65
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,824
what's really precious

66
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:06,912
Hot!

67
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:11,186
Christmas always finds its way back

68
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,494
And it's a white Christmas

69
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,863
White my ass!

70
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:26,734
Young-woo, let's drink.
It's Christmas Eve

71
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:32,006
What does the snow
bring to your mind?

72
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:37,414
That it's snowing

73
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,519
"It's snowing"?

74
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:46,317
I...
God, it's snowing a lot

75
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,223
It reminds me of my first love

76
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:54,026
She loved it when it snowed

77
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:58,536
Said she wanted to watch it snow
together until we die

78
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,429
3 weeks after I joined the army,

79
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:03,041
she sent me a Dear John letter

80
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:06,402
Hey

81
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:10,438
So I decided not to trust gals
who love snow

82
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,345
You know why?

83
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,545
Because their words melt away,
as does the snow

84
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,249
Even the melted snow vanishes
as people walk on it

85
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,356
That's why they are not trustworthy

86
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:28,167
Don't you have any memories
that the snow brings back?

87
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,667
No, nothing

88
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:38,370
I thought so.
It'd be strange if you did

89
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:42,573
What do you think about
when you look at stars?

90
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:49,984
That they're hung in the sky

91
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,887
"They're hung in the sky"

92
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:57,192
Should I keep talking or what?

93
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,496
So, you're telling me
you've never been in love?

94
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,106
What kind of life is that?

95
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:12,803
Well, what do I care?

96
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,709
Live like your master, Alphonse

97
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,114
I like you a lot
cause you're so much like a dog

98
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:24,121
Stop staring at me

99
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:28,858
Why am I so miserable
on Christmas

100
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:32,922
That's enough

101
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:37,902
Come on, tell me honestly

102
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:43,834
You don't have anyone

103
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:46,035
you wanna frolic with in the snow?

104
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,844
No

105
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:55,281
- Shit
- Are you okay?

106
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,920
Okay, Ok

107
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:02,655
No girl has ever loved you?

108
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,458
No

109
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,526
Look at me!

110
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:10,561
Check it out, dude
It's... Hot!

111
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,268
You don't feel anything
when it snows?

112
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,476
No

113
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:25,278
The whole world is white.
No feelings at all?

114
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,485
No

115
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:33,081
- Fuck me!
- What?

116
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:36,088
Think about it

117
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:41,889
It's been snowing all day,
and you say nothing but "No"

118
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:47,802
That drives me nuts.
Why is the snow white then?

119
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,307
Why not black, red, blue, or yellow?

120
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:55,813
How could you have no feelings
about that damned white snow?

121
00:13:56,249 --> 00:14:00,015
Tell you what

122
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,518
Let's go snow-sledding tomorrow
if it clears up

123
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:08,219
Snow-sledding?
Who do you think I am, Rudolph?!

124
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:12,821
I hate snow!

125
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:18,130
I hate Christmas.
I'm a freaking Buddhist

126
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:21,570
Stop snowing!

127
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,549
Hon... Honey!

128
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:25,003
Finally finished

129
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:33,444
This is it.
When the snow melts away,

130
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:37,448
Will the walls around
your heart collapse as well?

131
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,479
You're good at answering.
Don't fail me now

132
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:49,061
They won't

133
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,466
You're unbelievable

134
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:59,461
Alphonse, take care

135
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,204
Don't eat too much, okay?

136
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:09,605
I'm really going.
I'm leaving before I go mad

137
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,475
Alphonse!

138
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:14,981
Hey!

139
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,355
Wait up!

140
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:23,791
Aaak! Aaak!

141
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,697
Hey, you!

142
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,190
What are you doing here?

143
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,519
Gosh, I feel alive again

144
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:30,553
I came hiking and got stuck
in the snow

145
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,999
How long have you been here?

146
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:40,103
A while

147
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,038
This is like a mountain cottage

148
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:51,148
I wouldn't mind living here

149
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:56,453
Not for too long, though

150
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,956
A week

151
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,494
A month at the longest

152
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,130
Can hikers stay here?

153
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:14,902
This is my workplace

154
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,443
It gets dark early up here

155
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:55,803
Thanks for the tea

156
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,684
It'll be nightfall soon

157
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,466
Play, movie

158
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,927
Concert, play, movie

159
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,377
Mrs.

160
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:36,579
- By any chance, are you into art?
- Art?

161
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,387
Excuse me

162
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:27,365
Aren't you the lady from the store?

163
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:28,423
Excuse me

164
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,194
What... what store?

165
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:34,929
You must be mistaken

166
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:08,063
YoungChun >
< WolDong

167
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,654
Where have you been?

168
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:17,032
I got lost

169
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,139
I'm so cold

170
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,310
The fire has died

171
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,203
Good morning

172
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,242
Alphonse

173
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:04,672
You were out of reach

174
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:11,745
Said he'd never come back

175
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,588
Then I figured out

176
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,324
that you were far away

177
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,857
But I didn't stop waiting

178
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:50,046
Did you get back at that dog?

179
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:08,068
It carries too much sentimental value

180
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,378
You know what?

181
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:28,991
I'm hungry...

182
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,724
I didn't have lunch

183
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,556
Okay

184
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:42,239
- Go ahead
- Yummy!

185
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,292
Still, I have no problem
using a scalpel

186
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,526
I know

187
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,286
What are those?

188
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,057
They're all stars?

189
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,106
Looks like

190
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:51,141
salt spilt on the table

191
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:54,145
God, it's beautiful

192
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:58,573
Feels like we're trapped inside a star

193
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:02,443
That's the Little Dipper, right?

194
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,157
Every time I see it

195
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,686
I think of you

196
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:27,375
What constellation
do I remind you of?

197
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,052
Never thought about it

198
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:40,024
Really?

199
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:47,793
Are you sure?

200
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:51,269
I'm leaving

201
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,499
It's freezing out there

202
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,265
If I freeze to death
give me a nice funeral

203
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,270
Hold on

204
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:02,505
There's one

205
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:06,045
Please sit

206
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,267
What is it?

207
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,238
You remind me of...

208
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,605
It's Andromeda

209
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:37,380
Andromeda was
a princess of Ethiopia

210
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:44,282
It has only happy stars with it

211
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:51,688
She was beautiful
and warm-hearted

212
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,300
What do you say?

213
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:00,270
A lot like you, huh?

214
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:12,480
Not interesting?

215
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,502
Are you okay?

216
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,320
Let's go!

217
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:43,867
Come on, I'll race you!

218
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:09,960
Soo-yeon!

219
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:20,000
Soo-yeon, are you okay?

220
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,837
No, don't pull it out

221
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:28,444
Let me carry you

222
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:35,781
Hang on

223
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:38,516
Hang in there

224
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:46,030
Stay with me, Soo-yeon

225
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,002
We're almost there

226
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:57,472
We're home

227
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,479
Soo-yeon, Soo-yeon

228
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:13,322
I'll go fetch a doctor

229
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:30,570
Keep yourself from falling asleep

230
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,526
Pick up, Please...

231
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,609
Alphonse, Come on!

232
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,875
Stay by her side, understand?
Come on, go

233
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:36,073
Alphonse...

234
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,913
There's no point

235
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:47,611
Don't be stubborn with me

236
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,750
I thought there was no illness

237
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,449
you couldn't fix

238
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:57,525
Or you don't want to

239
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:02,595
How can you be saying that?
You're so mean

240
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:04,801
Tell me

241
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:10,605
Don't you miss our son?

242
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:26,289
I looked everywhere for it

243
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:29,690
You've been hiding it?

244
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,124
I'm sure

245
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:39,703
he's a sweet person after you

246
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:42,496
No, he takes after you

247
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:45,199
A birthmark behind his ear

248
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,678
just like yours

249
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,687
I think my time's up

250
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:14,804
The thought of leaving you
breaks my heart

251
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:19,903
But it's more painful to live,
missing him

252
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:27,284
Don't skip your medicine

253
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:31,688
I think my heart is failing me

254
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:39,886
I'm ready
Let me rest in peace

255
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,962
If you find our son after I die...

256
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:49,670
please tell him

257
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:54,005
that I missed him

258
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:10,628
Honey...

259
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:13,557
I'm so sorry

260
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:19,368
I'd wanted to tell you that
all these years

261
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,676
I brought this upon myself

262
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:32,509
losing everyone I care for

263
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:41,724
We'll be reunited before long

264
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:46,925
I'll follow your steps soon

265
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:11,841
Nurse Kim,
Thank you for while

266
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:16,512
The Hospital closed now...

267
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:20,551
You're a doctor, right?

268
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,495
At the peak...

269
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,390
You have to save her

270
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:30,496
We don't have much time.
We must go now

271
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:34,771
Catch your breath first, son

272
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,597
You have to save her

273
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,138
The only girl I've given my heart
is dying up there

274
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:46,707
Please, you must save her.
I'm begging you

275
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,414
Please, doctor

276
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:54,586
Are you listening?
Please!

277
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:58,457
We don't have much time
We've got to go now!

278
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:04,658
I've just lost my lifetime love

279
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:09,469
And you're asking me save yours

280
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:13,403
Doctor?

281
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:30,085
Let's take a break

282
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:35,624
No time to waste.
I'll carry you on my back

283
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:45,664
You're desperate.
Lead the way, I'll walk

284
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:28,276
Never been on anyone's back.
It feels good, though

285
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,646
Why's that?

286
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:36,952
You smell good

287
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:42,653
Let your parents experience it

288
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:50,932
Wish I could.
I don't have parents

289
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,363
So many stars tonight

290
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:26,429
I had a son long ago

291
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:31,438
He was so fascinated by stars

292
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:37,843
It was as starry then

293
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:49,292
I think about my parents
looking at stars

294
00:46:18,823 --> 00:46:22,088
Let's... take a break

295
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:30,495
Don't you want to save
the girl you love?

296
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:42,974
Keep walking
Come on, a little further

297
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:09,302
In here

298
00:47:23,954 --> 00:47:26,388
Soo-yeon?

299
00:47:57,688 --> 00:48:00,418
- What are you looking at?
- Huh?

300
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,756
- Put the kettle on
- Okay

301
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:23,910
Thank you so much, doctor

302
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:30,920
Don't worry
You didn't carry me for nothing

303
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,585
I need to rest

304
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:51,935
Doctor

305
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:54,693
Stars are so bright tonight

306
00:49:57,574 --> 00:49:59,474
Has she come to?

307
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:00,744
Not yet

308
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,144
She'll be fine

309
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:07,775
I need to head back

310
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:12,088
It's too late, and the snow
is knee-high out there

311
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:18,954
You hurried me up here...

312
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:21,063
to save the girl you love

313
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:29,330
I need to get back to the girl
that I've loved all my life

314
00:52:27,524 --> 00:52:31,016
You're so big now

315
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:34,096
Look at that star!

316
00:54:47,998 --> 00:54:49,192
Soo-yeon?

317
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:31,100
Who treated me?

318
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:33,770
Stars...

319
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:35,931
Stars?

320
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:37,936
Yes

321
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:41,042
The stars came down and gone

322
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:44,680
I see...

323
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:47,480
Don't just stand there

324
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:55,856
Come closer... and hold my hand
