1
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,477
Brother Jersy will have
a game with Turkey tonight?

2
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,709
Anyone takes side bet?

3
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,787
Those who bet on
Jersy get 60% dividend

4
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,787
And 100% for Turkey,
of course l bet on Turkey

5
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,823
Don´t bet for him, l´m little Ping

6
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,588
l bet on Jersy, $50,000!

7
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,727
Brother, everyone bets on you

8
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,737
As your mom had
a hard time to bring you up

9
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,172
you´d better die to pay her,
as you´re so stupid

10
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,876
You won´t win
if you don´t bet on me

11
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,876
Turkey is a stink ass-hole!

12
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,045
No foul language

13
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,220
No foul language?
But it gives me power

14
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,622
l don´t like it

15
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,619
What then?

16
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,787
Foul language may also
be pleasing to the ears

17
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,221
and just like singing

18
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,993
Foul language can be
as pleasing as singing?

19
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:12,857
l don´t believe

20
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:13,794
lt´s true

21
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,166
Good...

22
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,876
Who says good?

23
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,184
Not me

24
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,754
Hasn´t bastard Jersy arrived?

25
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,957
Turkey, you can´t wait to lose?

26
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,558
l don´t know what Jersy
and Turkey are playing

27
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,099
lt should be my turn to decide
how to gamble this time

28
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,767
You´ll lose whatever
game you decide

29
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,703
Mahjong, Poker, Baccarat,
you have never won

30
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,711
Hey, what games will we play
as you ask me here?

31
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,746
Let´s play snooker

32
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,409
and then we bet on soccer!

33
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,319
The bet for soccer is $1 million

34
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,749
England Vs Portugal,
England giving half goal

35
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,491
l always try to help the weaker side

36
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,763
Now England leads by 2 goals,
l´ll bet Portugal will win

37
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,856
For snooker, let´s bet on
our places of control

38
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,497
lf you lose, you let me
have Mongkok

39
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,135
lf l lose, you get Lai Chi Kok

40
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,430
You get more advantage, ass-hole!

41
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,335
Hey, what have l said?

42
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,942
One, two, three, four

43
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,183
Oh...

44
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,480
l give you a banana

45
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,716
Oh...

46
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,883
Will you suck it?

47
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,161
Good song!

48
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,197
Honey, is it good enough?

49
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,630
OK

50
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,903
Hey, will you accept the bet?

51
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,176
Make it Lai Chi Kok
and Cheung Sha Wan

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,275
Jersy, since you defeated
me in Poker game last time

53
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,251
l´ve missed for 4 months

54
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,411
As l´ve been practising
with my coach Davis

55
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,419
18 hours a day

56
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,119
l have now made a big leap

57
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,019
You must die this time!

58
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,371
Hubby, he´s mighty

59
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,069
Who is your coach?

60
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,005
Same as his, Davis

61
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,376
And also Beckham, Jordan

62
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,381
Then you needn´t fear him

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,914
But to tell the truth...

64
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,748
l learn soccer from Davis

65
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,186
And from Beckham...

66
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,551
l learn basketball

67
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,088
From Jordan...

68
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,755
l learn from him
as how to cook hotpot

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,730
What?

70
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,502
l´ve won, l´ll serve first

71
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,842
But l want one cue to decide victory

72
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,070
Whoever hits the ball first shall win

73
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,204
Ok, l don´t fear you!

74
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,749
Turkey, you fell into my trap!

75
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,878
My coach, Jordan, is not
the basketball player

76
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,550
He indeed lives in Jordan Road

77
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,817
who everyone refers him as
Mighty-left-handed Sweeper!

78
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,893
Roll...

79
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,006
What have you just said?

80
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,849
What Mighty-lefthanded Sweeper?

81
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,350
My honey!

82
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,230
Hit

83
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:12,736
Honey!

84
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,910
Deduce 4 points,
l lead you by 3 points now!

85
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,487
You...

86
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,985
l tell you, the trick just then...

87
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,258
is my most secret skill

88
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,160
What is it called?
lt´s called Tornado Shoot

89
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,657
You think the red balls have
stopped in front of the pocket?

90
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,594
ln fact it is spinning at a high
speed of 100 spins a second

91
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,326
and creates lightning
effect on the felt cover

92
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,539
Once the white ball hits it,
it´ll spin like turnado

93
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,038
And it´ll fall dead

94
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,244
l´ve perfected it,
no one can escape

95
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,276
Nuts!

96
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,843
England loses when it
leads by 2 goals? Damn it!

97
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,988
Turkey, why so stupid?

98
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,551
There´s a device called
VCR in this world

99
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,185
This match ended
15 minutes ago already

100
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,032
You can´t be a culprit
as you´re foolish

101
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,324
You´d better become a good guy

102
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:16,767
Damn it!

103
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,282
Boss!

104
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,415
Honey, you´re my boy!

105
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:06,984
Brother Jersy, hurrah!

106
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,748
Help yourselves, please

107
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,547
Thank you, Boss

108
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,785
You don´t cook some for me?

109
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,352
What do you mean?

110
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,934
l courted you as l thought
you were a foreigner

111
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,327
As l thought if l took you out...

112
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,766
your English will astonish others

113
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,001
But both your English
and Chinese are lousy

114
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,571
l wonder where you are from

115
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,469
Tahiti

116
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,777
Tahiti?

117
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:34,776
Yeah

118
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,878
You mustn´t mix...

119
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,207
the local beach up with Tahiti

120
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,755
My native language is French, you know?

121
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,617
You speak French?

122
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,924
God damn your mother!

123
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,425
Eat now

124
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,919
l don´t know what you´re speaking

125
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,800
Nothing, only curse you

126
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,036
Hey, fatty!

127
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,436
l´ve won millions of dollars today

128
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,234
and you serve me only this food?

129
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,213
Eat some vegetables

130
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,179
Fatty, don´t know who l am?
The new Master of Gambling

131
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,317
Eat vegetables?
l´ll only eat food from heaven!

132
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,453
You?

133
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,020
Damn you!

134
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,916
Not suitable for children

135
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,755
Then... let´s sing nursery rhymes

136
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,595
You´re an ass-hole,
everywhere in Hong Kong

137
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,291
People try to chop you,
Kick you ass-hole

138
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,906
You´re an ass-hole, dot...

139
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,335
What does dot mean?

140
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,176
Foul language,
for the sake of censor

141
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,444
You damned fool

142
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,951
You cannot be compared with
Cool of the old days

143
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,724
The Cool you mean...

144
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,357
is the guy made a fame
with flying cards...

145
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,224
when the God, Holy,
Master retired from gambling

146
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,456
He´s the favourite of all female

147
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,865
On the list of
Most Wanted Husband...

148
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,365
he´s the only guy
who defeated Richard Gear

149
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,531
lf Cool hadn´t disappeared 3 years ago...

150
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,037
you´re no better than a mouse
when you stand next to him

151
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,302
He disappeared for the sake of love?

152
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,107
That´s a stupid Cool

153
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,951
He´s my idol anyway

154
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,552
l was still a parking valet
when he made a fame

155
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,618
Can you tell me more about him?

156
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,615
l remember at that time...

157
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,857
Cool was cocky and proud

158
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,014
For Cool´s legend, besides
being a competent gambler

159
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,045
he also has a sexy girlfriend, Karen

160
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,488
and his sworn brother Yeung Kwong,
who was always calm

161
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,987
The three of them formed a triangle

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,358
Once the battle with his rival...

163
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,761
Cool threw all the money in the sky,
total to millions of dollars

164
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:13,899
Then he and Karen danced
in the wind of banknotes

165
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,135
lsn´t it a classic?

166
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,307
ls it true?

167
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,340
Well, to compare with Cool...

168
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,204
you´re no more than a mouse

169
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,014
lf Cool was really so mighty...

170
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,484
how come he disappeared suddenly?

171
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,456
Did someone assassinate him?

172
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,661
Hey, as you´ve won so much

173
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,296
Why not go on a trip to Japan?

174
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,957
People say Cool could turn poker
cards into flying blades

175
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,034
ls it true?

176
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:44,999
l want to go shopping

177
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,099
l want to go shopping

178
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,337
l want to go shopping in Japan

179
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,942
l want to go shopping

180
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,772
l want to go shopping in Japan...

181
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,639
l want to go shopping!

182
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:03,344
l want to go shopping in Japan!

183
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,054
l know l´m wrong

184
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,991

Harajuku, Matsushitato

199
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,963
Going shopping?
From dawn to dusk?

200
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,024
Of course we must
go shopping here in Japan

201
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,902
But you needn´t shop
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

202
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:26,799
You needn´t eat something?

203
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:27,802
You mean it

204
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,099
Let´s eat something

205
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,207
When can we have a meal?

206
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,545
My friend, take it easy

207
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,714
Let´s get a bath back in the hotel

208
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,538
and gather for a meal

209
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,307
OK? Let´s get back to the hotel first

210
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,720
Jersy, get up!

211
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,653
l´ve taken my 4th bath,
When are we going for a meal?

212
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,387
Then take the 5th now

213
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,527

214
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,662
Get up, ask that fatty out!

215
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,733
Hurry!

216
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,734
Quiet, everybody...

217
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,101
l don´t know what´s on,
l work part time only

218
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,241
l don´t know what you´re saying

219
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,973
Refund now!

220
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,944
The fatty is nowhere to see,
he must have slipped away

221
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,241
You mean it?

222
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,946
l must beat him up
when l return to HK!

223
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,749
lt´s so dark at the early hours?

224
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,958
And there´s no restaurant nearby, shit

225
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,231
Walk a bit further,
and see if there´s a shop

226
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,236
No, l´m not familiar with this area

227
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,405
lf we get robbed, we can never
find that bastard again

228
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,471
Let´s get back to the hotel now

229
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,939
No, l must eat something

230
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,470
l´m starving

231
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,374
Look at you, you´re barely dressed

232
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,908
And you leap while walking

233
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,377
This is a real leaping lamp

234
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,075
We´ll be ruined if guys rape us

235
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,918
lf l get kidnapped, l´ll be raped

236
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,057
But if l go back with you,
you´ll rape me

237
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,793
You look down on me?

238
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,483
l didn´t mean that

239
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,187
We´re getting along with true love

240
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:04,463
Just like the lovers
in the movie Titanic

241
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,539
Hey, Chinese cuisine

242
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,440
l´ll ruin the shop
if they are closed

243
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,014
No one is here?
ls it a funeral parlour?

244
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,251
What would you like?

245
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,721
Let me see

246
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,557
A Chinese restaurant with
only Japanese menu?

247
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,993
This is Japan, they mean
to serve Japanese

248
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,466
What would you like?

249
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,004
Two bowls of shark fin soup,
two abolones

250
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,307
and lobsters

251
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,701
Don´t overcharge, only $70 in HK

252
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,408
Does it?

253
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,545
Then the restaurant
must be owned by your dad

254
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,944
This boss is handsome

255
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,118
You need a bowl of fried rice
or a handsome guy now?

256
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,519
Answer me!

257
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:00,916
Fried rice

258
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,858
Fukien Fried Rice, Classic Fried Rice,
Yamadei Fried Rice

259
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:05,996
Get whatever fried rice
you have for us

260
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,126
You´re very hungry?

261
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,098
- ls it enough?
- Yes

262
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,003
Not bad, you´re from HK?

263
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,139
Yeah, l´ve been here
for a couple of years

264
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,610
You´d better go back to HK

265
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,377
This place is shabby,
you can´t have good business

266
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,147
Go back to HK and work under me,
l´m Jersy

267
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,811
And you´ll have a better living

268

Brother Jersy?
What field are you in?

269

Sure, in HK, everyone has
a nick name ends with.com

279
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,941
Look at you, you mustn´t have
won big money

280
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,649
Go back to HK and
l´ll teach you some tricks

281
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,408
And you´ll run into good luck

282
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,989
Chinaman, have you thought over?

283
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,298
l´ve put it clear already

284
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,064
No protection money,
then you close!

285
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,292
l have no money!

286
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,129
lt´s late, why are there
furious white-collars?

287
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,442
They come to
collect protection money

288
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,237
Japanese culprits

289
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,375
They deserve the money!

290
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,105
Look how cool they are, all in suit

291
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,475
Who are you, ass-hole?

292
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,844
He seems to follow what l say,
what did he say?

293
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,180
Never mind him

294
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,922
Translate it for me

295
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,057
Nothing, he says you look lousy

296
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,053
Why are you
so frank in the translation?

297
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,165
lf not, a fierce fight
could be avoided

298
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,733
Go to hell you ass-hole!

299
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,339
Kick his mother fucking ass! Baby

300
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,644
Beat him!

301
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,249
Baby, beat him...

302
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,919
Why he only beats me?

303
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,125
What did he say?

304
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,461
He asked why you only
chase and beat him

305
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,099
lt´s because of what you say!

306
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,426
You look cocky,
so you must be beaten!

307
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,330
Translate it for him!

308
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:32,942
Get weapon, bitch!

309
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,241
Take it!

310
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,444
Damn it! Wait!

311
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,746
Eat some vegetables

312
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,049
Bastard, go to hell!

313
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,872
Honey, you´re my hero!

314
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,237
l´m a very good eagle. Right?

315
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,078
You´re pulling down the place?

316
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,412
Sorry

317
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,483
l´ll have it mended
before l return to HK

318
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,516
No thanks

319
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,756
lt´s you who threw the saucer?

320
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,285
What saucer?

321
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,088
Cool is a great man

322
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,764
He made a fame with flying cards

323
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,000
You are?

324
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,036
Wong

325
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,604
Wong?

326
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,569
You´re from HK

327
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,006
Have you ever heard of Cool

328
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:41,941
a real special man?

329
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,978
Cool?

330
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,343
Haven´t heard of

331
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,183
Much work for me now

332
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,349
Honey, what are you thinking?

333
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,758
But l feel that this Wong...
must be related to Cool

334
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,842
He´s as competent as l

335
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,459
He must have been in Japan for ages,
and learn from Japanese

336
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,562
He uses the peeping binoculars

337
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,681
l´m not the same,
l´m always horny and sly

338
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,191
You´re a real busybody

339
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,133
Yeah, l don´t know why

340
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,631
Someone said you have a girlfriend
called Karen

341
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,772
But you still peep at women?

342
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,564
She´s my girlfriend

343
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,237
Still peeping?
Go into and molest her now!

344
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,636
She´s already other´s wife

345
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:31,749
l´m sorry

346
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,481
But... she seems to be asleep

347
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,047
As she becomes a vegetable now

348
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:41,686
What a pity

349
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,692
are you OK?

350
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,662
l´m OK

351
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,029
Jersy, if you treat me as a friend

352
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,134
please don´t interfere in my affairs

353
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,473
Of course l treat you as a friend!

354
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,369
l don´t mind even sharing
underpants with you!

355
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,008
l don´t want you to follow me,
as l will come here everyday

356
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,241
You say this yourself

357
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,708
She´s the girlfriend of another man

358
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,212
And also lead a vegetable existence

359
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,682
Why are you still hung up on her?

360
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,945
l needn´t tell you
about my personal affairs

361
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,519
Long hung love will hurt

362
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,953
Excuse me... do you know...

363
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,155
You´re from HK?

364
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,060
You speak Cantoness, great!

365
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,334
So-so, l like Hong Kong movies

366
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,868
Hong Kong movies?

367
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,497
You know me,
l´m a Hong Kong movie star

368
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,469
Adam Chow

369
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,904
Mr. Chow, aren´t you
in Hollywood now?

370
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,235
No. l come back to Hong Kong

371
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,243
l go to market to shop everyday

372
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,515
No Hollywood, no

373
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,682
Who are those guys?

374
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,747
Stuff, what kind of stuff?

375
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,321
They´re triad members

376
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:19,950
What is it?

377
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,717
l don´t care who he is, what is it?

378
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,722
Adam Chow of Japan

379
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,030
So they´re from underworld

380
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,257
Yes! God father!

381
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,160
OK...

382
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,469
You can piss on
the street from now on

383
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,695
Tell others Adam Chow,
l´m your protector

384
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,395
Now go home and eat shit

385
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,798
Thanks

386
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,407
Underworld of Japan?
l must get your background

387
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,367
Excuse me, l must go
and see my wife

388
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,965
Your wife... is she OK?

389
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
She´s become unconscious
since she got shot

390
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,034
And l keep talking to her everyday

391
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,707
l must also look after her

392
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,273
You´re so nice to your wife

393
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:19,848
Thank you

394
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,942
Excuse me

395
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,539
We mustn´t lay a hand on friend´s wife

396
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,435
But she´s wife of another man,
why not take a peep?

397
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,482
You go out for a while

398
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,927
Karen

399
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,600
lt´s good if you can hear
what l´m saying

400
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,704
Mr. Tetsuo has allied with me

401
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,574
From now on, casinos business
in S. E. Asia...

402
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,071
will be under our control

403
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,306
But he wants to find Cool

404
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,045
He says if the three
of us work together

405
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,947
we´ll become sure-winners

406
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,420
He´s my sworn brother anyway

407
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,487
Since many things
happened on your wedding day...

408
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,032
l´ve been missing him

409
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,903
lt´s good if he were here

410
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,439
At least...

411
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,835
he knows l come to
bath you everyday

412
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,744
After bathing you,
l can even enjoy your body...

413
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,174
every part of your body

414
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,176
l can kiss you too

415
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,248
l can caress you too

416
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,124
l can even beat you, just like this!

417
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,865
You´re dirty, let me clean you now

418
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,972
lt´s worse than porn VCD

419
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,244
Cool, you ass-hole!
What can you do?

420
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,378
He deserves this today

421
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,909
This time he loses totally

422
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,580
And he can´t have expected this

423
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:41,653
He can´t have expected her
beloved woman is ravaged by me

424
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,404
What are you looking at?

425
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,241
l don´t know what you´re saying

426
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,076
This is private place, why intrude in?

427
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,818
l come to...

428
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,387
l come to deliver pizza

429
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,789
Where is the pizza?

430
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,150
l´m too hungry and ate it

431
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,290
You still want one?
Let me bake another for you

432
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,273
You have good skills

433
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,072
Don´t think Jacky Chan is
the only kung fu fighter in HK

434
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,316
What is it?

435
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,453
There´s an unexpected caller

436
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,019
l know you have things to do,
judging from your appearance

437
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,122
l leave now

438
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,321
Damn it!

439
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,594
He doesn´t seem to be bad

440
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,496
Everyone spots on European Cup

441
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,663
will make big money

442
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,838
You find Cool, and
we three will work together

443
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,376
You´d better
take good care of your wife

444
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,504
Meet you tomorrow at the old place

445
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,815
Thanks for your patronage

446
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,924
Brother Cool!

447
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,761
Cool is dead, l´m only an ordinary guy

448
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,324
What ordinary guy?

449
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,431
l´ve learnt everything in that big house

450
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,529
That Yeung Kwong is a real maniac

451
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:33,964
And only you endure him

452
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,168
l wonder if you have
kidney stones, you poor

453
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,633
Stay out of my affairs

454
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,669
You mustn´t say so

455
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,705
You´re my idol,
l can´t bear others scold you...

456
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,108
let alone others bully you

457
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,612
l can´t be convinced!

458
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,580
l´ll return to HK
and get you help!

459
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,080
Don´t you hear?
Stay out of my affairs

460
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,886
Go away!

461
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:55,716
How come your make-up wears off?

462
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,361
Go to make-up,
make you more attractive

463
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,690
Good

464
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,564
Gossiping about that, go on

465
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,724
What is the relation among you three?

466
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,003
l can tell you,
but you must promise...

467
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,038
OK!

468
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,967
You must stay out of this

469
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:11,837
No problem

470
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,032
l think this incident...

471
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,911
dates back to 3 years ago,
on my very last game...

472
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:16,946
l know

473
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,212
Karen and you were dancing

474
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,213
And banknotes flew in the sky, right?

475
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,651
You know that too?

476
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,913
l wonder if anyone
upload it on the internet

477
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,382
That night, l had a game
with Joe of Causeway Bay

478
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,858
Pair 6

479
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:32,892
Pass

480
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,693
No pairs, Brother Cool?

481
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,929
Brother Cool, pair J

482
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,304
l wonder who will be
defeated this time

483
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,902
Pass

484
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:52,980
Pair J

485
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,547
Pair 2

486
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,210
You think your pair J
is big enough?

487
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,511
Of course l know

488
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,447
Triple Queens

489
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,328
Triple Kings, Triple Aces

490
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,823
Say, do l know?

491
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:08,823
Why didn´t you cast
when it was pair 6?

492
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,326
You want to know why?

493
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,096
As l love to see others...

494
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,668
falling to hell from heavens

495
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,339
What´s the problem of losing a bit?

496
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,109
lt´s worth just to see
how you behave now

497
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,810
You´re fooling me?

498
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,120
Here´s $10 million,
let´s have a final fight

499
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,524
You´re on your nerves?

500
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,417
Whoever loses shall
leave two of his fingers

501
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,387
OK, no problem

502
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,956
l can´t help if you think
you have too many fingers

503
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,432
Cool

504
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,306
We´ve got your wife and
children into our hands

505
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,337
You know what cards to
serve to Brother Joe now?

506
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,105
Yes, l do

507
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:54,641
Serve!

508
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,415
No need to shuffle, serve now

509
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:05,651
Yes

510
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,967
So good?

511
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,899
l might as well...

512
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,436
What are you doing?
Open the card?

513
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,774
No, l´m too bored only

514
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,281
Serve now

515
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,952
4 Diamond

516
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,451
2 Heart

517
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,781
So soon? Me too, 2 Spade

518
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,192
3 now

519
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,857
- Pair J
- Haven´t finished yet

520
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,026
Four 3´s, and one 9, anymore?

521
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,132
Pass

522
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,134
Then 6, 8, 10

523
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,174
and 7, 9, straight flush, you have?

524
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,644
lf you haven´t, last card

525
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,849
You´re in luck

526
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,985
My wife has become
famous of seducing men

527
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,224
All my 4 children are
not my offspring

528
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,058
Brother Joe,
you must kill them for me

529
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,725
l couldn´t ask for better, thanks!

530
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,362
What to trap me?
You should check beforehand

531
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,130
None of my followers will betray me

532
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,602
Ass-hole!

533
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,623
You don´t thank me when
l spare your fingers?

534
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,606
l suddenly want to dance

535
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,189
You don´t fear it´ll arouse others?

536
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,651
Arouse others?

537
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,562
Being in this world,
we either leave a bad fame

538
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,327
or a good reputation

539
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,163
lf no one will remember
me after a hard life

540
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,828
lt´ll be meaningless

541
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,665
Tonight, l want everyone...

542
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,398
to remember both of us

543
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,917
Cool, what is it?

544
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,323
There was a flaw, l failed finally

545
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,387
Just by chance

546
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,531
Not by chancel

547
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,362
For real gamblers,
a failure will be fatal!

548
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,068
Don´t be like this,
you´ve forced yourself too hard

549
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,207
l just don´t have alternative

550
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:18,632
ln all of Asia...

551
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,140
the two toppest gamblers
are Tetsuo and me

552
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,404
Whoever wins will become
number 1 in Asia

553
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,974
What if you become
number 1 in Asia?

554
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,848
But there´re numerous competent
gamblers, you can´t defeat them all

555
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,282
How long will the competition last?

556
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,158
Once l joined this field,
l´ve determined not to return

557
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,698
Cool, don´t be like this

558
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,764
We have lots of money already,
let´s not compete with them

559
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,108
OK? Promise me

560
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,370
l don´t want you
to go gambling again

561
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,240
Take your hands off

562
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,017
l´ll solve my own affairs, OK?

563
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,590
Who called just then?

564
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,252
lan called from USA?

565
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,690
Yes

566
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,884
What is it?

567
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,026
Police found cocaine at her dorm

568
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,398
But how come your twin sister...

569
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,869
is totally different from her sister?

570
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,265
Why must she give herself up?

571
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,635
You mustn´t blame her,
l have the responsibility too

572
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,370
Never mind her,
it´s not her first time

573
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,212
lt´s not your first time either

574
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,113
But did l leave you alone?

575
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,120
Sorry, am l disturbing you?

576
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,050
Not at all, what is it?

577
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:43,616
l´ve made appointment
with Tetsuo for you

578
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,419
at his underground casino
on the first day of next month

579
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,059
Take your time, l go inside

580
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,705
You failed again?

581
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,045
Just a bit

582
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,782
What if we ask our men here tonight...

583
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,346
and have a party?

584
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:09,648
Relax

585
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,919
You´ll make progress tomorrow, OK?

586
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,988
Come on, smile

587
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,662
Men, see what present
l have brought you

588
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,954
Everyone has left when l woke up

589
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,831
And l didn´t know Karen
left with Yeung Kwong

590
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,532
Not until a month
when someone told me...

591
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,771
Yeung Kwong co-operated
with Tetsuo in Japan

592
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,240
and he decided to get married
at the end of the month

593
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,079
The bride...

594
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,212
was Karen

595
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:05,927
Didn´t you see my girlfriend?

596
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,545
Brother Tetsuo!

597
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,245
Thanks for coming...

598
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:22,848
Please!

599
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,093
ls everything ready?

600
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,922
Yes, he´s at the tree

601
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,230
Range cover all this garden

602
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,586
Ask him not to fire too soon

603
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,726
That they only take action
when l drink with the bride

604
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:37,626
Got it?

605
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:38,764
Yes!

606
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,366
l´ll see who´s faster,
your poker card or my bullet

607
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,983
Excuse me, l must go out for a while

608
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,851
Where to?

609
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,349
l want to talk to you

610
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,422
Go out, all of you

611
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,196
What is it?

612
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,992
l find that it´s too hurried like this

613
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,900
Everyone says a bride runs up against
emotional impact before the ceremony

614
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:17,971
So it´s real

615
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,173
l´m serious

616
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,101
Haven´t we registered already?

617
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,773
But we haven´t finished
the ceremony yet

618
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,206
l´m disappointed in Cool

619
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,711
But that doesn´t mean
l want to marry you at once

620
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,120
lt´s unfair to both of us

621
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,221
Silly girl, don´t behave like a child

622
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,527
l want to get disengagement with you!

623
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,331
Come on

624
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,096
All my friends in HK, Taiwan, Japan...

625
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:50,338
and your parents

626
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,038
and also your brothers,
sisters are outside

627
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,777
Don´t tell me you
won´t get married now

628
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,983
Shouldn´t one give room to his lover?

629
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,786
Right

630
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,822
One should indeed
give room to his lover

631
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,569
l tell you

632
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,335
l never love you

633
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,708
lt´s nothing bad to sleep with you

634
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:28,904
The reason l get married with you...

635
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,804
is to make that foolish Cool show up!

636
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,677
You´d better finish this scene for me

637
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,885
Or else your family
can never leave Japan!

638
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,815
Karen!

639
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,220
Karen!

640
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,791
Karen!

641
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,662
Karen!

642
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,165
Cool, take it easy

643
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,404
Take it easy

644
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:36,641
None of your business!

645
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:41,646
Watch out!

646
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:54,996
Karen!

647
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:57,761
You´re sly!

648
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,659
Leave me alone...

649
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:00,826
Go away!

650
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,199
- Give Karen to me!
- Go away!

651
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,671
She´s already been my wife,
none of your affairs now!

652
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:05,737
Get out of here at once!

653
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:06,737
Leave me alone!

654
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,374
Take your hands off!

655
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,637
Cool...

656
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,580
Yeung Kwong is now my partner

657
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,654
l hope you behave sensibly

658
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,555
and respect yourself
and everyone here!

659
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,962
Doctor proved that
the bullet hit her spine

660
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,498
And she may be
a vegetable in future

661
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:39,609
Why don´t you take her away?

662
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,814
They are already wedded couple

663
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,285
They´re married by law terms

664
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,752
Furthermore, Japanese police
have warned me

665
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:54,681
They ask me not to disturb them

666
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:56,852
So l can´t take her away

667
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,154
Then you go and
peep at her everyday?

668
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,195
You´re really a love hung!

669
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,003
That Yeung Kwong is an ass-hole!

670
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,930
He means to torture you with Karen

671
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,039
he´s torturing you!

672
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,844
This is a pay back to me

673
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,446
Mr. Cool

674
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,876
Mr. Tetsuo is waiting outside

675
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,748
Cool, l´ve been looking for you

676
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,449
l know

677
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:32,751
l always want to meet you
after the wedding, how are you?

678
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,464
Thank you

679
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,165
l want to find out
who between us is better

680
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,065
l still want to find it out

681
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,400
You needn´t prove, you´re
Asian number 1 already

682
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,974
Those games were just a nuisance

683
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,135
lt´s not real games at all

684
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,643
But l´ve retired already

685
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,674
Can you just give it
a second thought?

686
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,645
l´ll consent to whatever
conditions you ask for

687
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,617
l´ll not gamble anymore

688
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,217
You mean you´re tough
at that decision?

689
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,055
You´re sly,
you want to gamble?

690
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:09,599
So gamble with me

691
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,192
You? You´re not up to me!

692
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,764
Just come to HK for a try

693
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,701
And l´ll surely cut off
your little dick as snack

694
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,205
l´ll turn it into sush!

695
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,371
You´re afraid?

696
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,144
Cool

697
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,479
How is it?

698
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:30,980
lf you change your mind,
come to see me

699
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:33,386
l won´t see you off

700
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,263
Cheers!

701
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,378
Welcome

702
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,861
You won´t understand

703
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,400
l come to see... your boss

704
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:23,673
Don´t stir up trouble

705
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,811
Don´t think you´re taller than
you can bully me, ass-hole!

706
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,055
Dare stir up trouble?
Who are you?

707
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,257
Stop nagging me

708
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,762
Anyone speaks Cantonese?

709
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,464
You´re from HK?

710
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:55,800
Hung Hing member?

711
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,806
You speak Cantonese?

712
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,569
lf l had known, l wouldn´t
have kicked you so hard

713
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,508
OK, ask your boss
Tetsuo to see me

714
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,339
l come to ruin the place

715
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,074
What did he say?

716
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,046
To ruin the place

717
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,152
Bastard, you´re too daring!

718
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,644
Why did you beat him?

719
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:11,910
He´s my friend!

720
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,985
Only he speaks Chinese!

721
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:20,825
l don´t beat insider

722
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:23,863
Why you beat me?

723
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:24,796
Why beat him?

724
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,102
He beats you, so l beat him,
why you beat me?

725
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,561
Go to hell!

726
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,336
Son-of-a-bitch!

727
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,288
lt´s you again

728
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,620
l´ve told you at Cool´s shop

729
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,388
that l must find you

730
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,323
Chinese people have a saying

731
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,698
