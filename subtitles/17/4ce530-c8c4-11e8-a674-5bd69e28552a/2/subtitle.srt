1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,830
Why laughing?

2
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:08,675
You can tell from my tattoo
l am naive and nice

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:11,476
Look at your tattoo,
want to scare others?

4
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:19,014
You guess first

5
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:20,706
Guess what?

6
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,885
Guess the outcome?

7
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:27,550
l don´t know the outcome of mine

8
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:29,620
but you must have none, open it

9
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:32,958
How come?

10
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,498
Must l kiss you? You didn´t
even know l exchanged your dice

11
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:37,958
Eat beans!

12
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:40,298
Your turn

13
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,800
What game do you want?

14
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:44,938
Poker

15
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:49,139
But l have a condition

16
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,143
l know you´re not that nice, tell me

17
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:55,512
lf you win, you may
take away all the cash here

18
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:57,852
lf you lose, leave one of your hands

19
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,787
Why must you bet on human limbs?

20
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:04,522
This is the rules of my casino

21
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:07,554
Everyone who challenges
me must comply with it

22
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:09,459
l don´t mind telling you

23
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:12,264
l come, not for your dirty money

24
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:15,999
l come to tell you l, Jersy,
can defeat you, Tetsuo!

25
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:19,470
OK, just don´t regret

26
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:21,006
Begin

27
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,576
Hey, 3 Diamond serve first

28
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,609
You´re host, but why so mean?

29
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:03,051
OK, l´m host, you serve first

30
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:06,684
A pair or K

31
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:09,053
A pair of 2

32
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,131
Straight Flush, you have that?

33
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,975
2 Heart, you have 11 cards on hand

34
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:32,478
l know how to change cards too

35
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:34,943
But l thought you wouldn´t use
this trick as you´re expert

36
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:38,048
Kid, you´re not up to it

37
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:40,286
l´ve lost

38
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,886
But... may I keep my hand?

39
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,062
OK?

40
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,163
Not necessarily

41
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:54,369
Ass-hole, drip wax on me?

42
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,278
Hello?

43
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:04,638
Tetsuo speaking

44
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,244
There´s no common topic
between us, l´m afraid

45
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:09,948
Your friend is here with me

46
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:11,283
Who?

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,488
The guy with you last night

48
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,451
l´ve said l love watching wax dripping

49
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:18,319
But not trying it myself!

50
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,992
Man, weaker flame, slowly please

51
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,223
Do you hear him?

52
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,228
He has nothing to do with me

53
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:28,670
You´re so cool?

54
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:29,938
Cool!

55
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:31,838
Hold it...

56
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:34,741
You wait for me

57
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,348
Jersy!

58
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:45,618
My God! Jersy!

59
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:48,017
Cool, take me away!

60
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:49,855
These people are beasts!

61
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:51,691
Are you OK?

62
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:55,325
OK? But l really reach climax!

63
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,699
Give me face and
let me take him away

64
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,568
You can´t just come and go

65
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:06,969
or else Mr. Tetsuo will lose face

66
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:08,300
This has nothing to do with you

67
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:13,175
Cool, l always take you as buddy

68
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,180
But due to our rules,
l can´t be of help

69
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,678
What must l do to take him away?

70
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,320
Leave a hand

71
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:24,520
You must be killing me!

72
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,421
l wonder if l can win back his hand?

73
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:30,995
You´ll gamble with me?

74
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,998
l have no choice, right?

75
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,101
lf you lose,
you must leave both hands

76
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:37,604
No way!

77
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,773
My left hand is my beloved limb

78
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:41,738
And you mustn´t chop it

79
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:44,776
Why keep your left hand?
You´re not left-handed

80
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:45,842
l tell you...

81
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,882
since l was 13

82
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:50,514
My left hand has helped me wanking

83
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,617
And l still need it for wanking in future

84
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:56,752
This... chop it at once!

85
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:01,422
Mr. Tetsuo, what do you think?

86
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:06,391
l´ve been longing for
a game with you for 3 years

87
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,603
So why not invite Asian
celebrities here as witnesses

88
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,833
They can be judge of our game

89
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:13,501
l don´t mean this

90
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,671
l only want a game with you here

91
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:19,372
And no one shall reveal
the result, whoever of us win

92
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:23,248
OK, you´re expert

93
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:27,084
Let´s have a game
of sudden death

94
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,354
What do you want to play?

95
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,724
Flying Poker cards

96
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,221
OK, we´ll each draw 5 cards,
and see whose cards are bigger

97
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,425
l have no objection

98
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,178
No Ace, no 9, you can´t
get straight flush now

99
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:38,086
l have straight flush

100
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,593
But you´ve torn these 9s just then

101
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,765
lf l hadn´t pushed an 8 in it

102
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:48,097
l think you never believe there´s no 9

103
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,174
5, 6, 7, 8, 9

104
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,275
ls my straight flush bigger than yours?

105
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,783
Good, Cool has won!

106
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,118
You know why l like you,
as you´re mad at games

107
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:08,385
Untie him

108
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,053
l can take him away?

109
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:14,489
Yes

110
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,153
l really want to have
a serious game with you

111
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,029
Maybe later

112
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:24,331
Don´t go, l want to talk to you

113
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,199
You really go to peep
at my wife everyday?

114
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:31,310
What do you mean?
You love peeping?

115
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,572
lt´s OK, l have lots of tapes

116
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:38,213
You know, everyday after l bath her

117
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:42,323
l start playing her, up
and down, front and back...

118
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,791
As we´re buddies, enjoy

119
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,389
You´re not human!

120
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:50,894
She´s my wife,
you can´t change this fact

121
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,835
Tonight... I'll play
wax dripping with her

122
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,406
Ready to get my tapes

123
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,473
Let´s go, never mind the rope

124
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:03,242
You must try tonight, it´s funny

125
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:05,072
What did you talk to him?

126
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:09,342
About our co-operation

127
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:12,545
But he keeps beating the bush

128
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:14,912
Does he?

129
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:18,360
You needn´t say anymore

130
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,428
l will close this place and leave

131
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:23,827
Where are you going?

132
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,531
l don´t know

133
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:28,194
Now that they know l run this place

134
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,459
They´ll keep giving me trouble

135
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,639
You´d better go back to HK,
l don´t want you to get involved

136
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,733
l suggest that...

137
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:36,876
we should all return to HK!

138
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,409
And we´ll surely turn HK upside-down!

139
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:41,577
This life-style is not my cup of tea

140
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:44,778
Not your cup of tea?

141
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:47,222
lf not, why not switch to another?

142
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,153
Since you want to leave,
what about taking Karen with you?

143
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:54,021
Taking Karen with me?

144
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:55,696
Sure, you fear you´ll be arrested?

145
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:58,227
Take her out and fly with her

146
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,696
to a place where no one knows you

147
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:01,800
Then you can lead your own life

148
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:03,936
lt must be better than
leave her with that maniac

149
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,404
Doesn´t that hurt you?

150
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,739
Come on, he is right. OK, let´s go

151
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:11,812
Don´t consider, let´s take
Karen with us tomorrow!

152
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,509
Don´t shout, l won´t hurt you

153
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,422
Karen, don´t panic, l´m here

154
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:07,778
She behaves normally

155
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:08,947
Don´t worry, it´s going to be fine

156
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:11,055
Thanks

157
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:31,005
Look how romantic they are

158
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,448
And you, you´re a real stink!

159
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:36,107
A famous Japanese movie star
came for me and l ignored her

160
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,183
And you detest me?

161
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:38,683
Ghosts come for you, l say!

162
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,855
Can you let Karen have a rest?

163
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,214
She has been asleep for years

164
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,686
may be wakened
with our shouting

165
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:46,792
Go out please

166
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,226
l ask you not to shout

167
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:49,261
You go, you go and l´ll be quiet

168
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:51,160
What me go?
You bullshit all day!

169
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,630
Don´t push me!

170
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:58,466
Oh! My God!

171
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,294
Have l slept for a long time?

172
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:23,789
No

173
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,064
Karen...

174
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:31,035
l seem to have made a...
very long dream

175
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:36,576
l cannot find you in my dream

176
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,271
lt´s not a dream,
you were not dreaming...

177
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,544
You´ve wakened, really wakened

178
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,347
Karen...

179
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,090
Don´t leave me!

180
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,121
No, l never will

181
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:57,989
l won´t ever leave you...

182
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,627
l won´t ever leave you

183
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,198
l´ll stay with you forever

184
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,098
Honey...

185
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,343
Hold me!

186
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:16,208
Say... do you love me?

187
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,078
Of course l love you

188
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:22,147
Buy me a gold watch then

189
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:25,321
Doctor, are you here?

190
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,125
See if she´s nuts or something!

191
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:29,763
You´re bad!

192
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,866
No sex for one month!

193
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:35,061
l think you´d better
leave Japan at once

194
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,636
But Karen has no passport

195
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,837
Don´t worry, before l became a Boss

196
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:42,133
l learnt how to make a fake passport

197
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,011
l only need a genuine
passport as sample

198
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,611
then l can duplicate
a passport for Karen

199
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:49,616
Where to find a genuine one?

200
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,144
Don´t you have one?

201
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,176
What about me?
How can l go home?

202
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:57,182
Report loss to Consulate, and
you´ll get a new one in weeks

203
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:58,993
OK

204
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:01,155
l can stay and do more shopping

205
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:11,172
2,000 Yen here, we´ll share, take it

206
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,905
Put it away, it´s bad if you lose it

207
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:21,345
You take it all

208
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,643
Why? Why so mean?

209
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:24,614
Still got more?

210
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,718
No more

211
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:27,188
Give me at once!

212
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,626
Why must you be so practical?

213
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,885
What? 50,000 Yen is still very little!

214
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:34,654
Still got more?

215
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:35,887
No more!

216
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:37,890
l still have a roll of banknotes

217
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,791
lt´s not money, stop this!

218
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,484
Hey, remember this place?

219
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:02,417
You two danced casually here

220
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:03,681
and it has become a legend

221
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:06,060
The past life doesn´t suit me anymore

222
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:09,892
You must adapt to it again, anyway

223
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:11,230
Why?

224
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,468
Jersy, what are these people doing?

225
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,334
l am really someone in HK

226
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:24,907
As you´re my sworn brother...

227
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,240
l must make a welcome party for you

228
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:28,414
Greet Brother Cool!

229
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:31,445
Welcome Cool,
welcome to show up again!

230
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:34,888
Jersy, l have never said
l´ll show up again

231
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,051
Haven´t you?

232
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:37,322
Cool

233
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:40,220
Don´t let them down, OK?

234
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:42,987
But l´m not used to
this situation anymore

235
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:44,624
But l find it pretty good

236
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:48,601
As long as you like it

237
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:51,236
OK then!

238
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:52,970
Say no more, open champagne!

239
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,205
Cheers for Brother Cool!

240
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:08,354
Hey, how do you feel now
that you´re back in HK?

241
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:10,823
Everything is strange to me

242
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:12,791
You´ll adapt it slowly

243
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:15,663
The more you stick to rich, dirty life

244
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,290
and you´ll get used to it soon

245
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,864
l used to enjoy such a material life

246
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,462
but this time l come back...

247
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,170
l find everything is an illusion

248
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:31,543
Jersy, don´t ask me to the situation
like last night again

249
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,710
OK, make it every other night

250
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:35,775
Right, where´s Karen?

251
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,649
l´ve send a guard
to go shopping with her

252
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,919
and l also gave her
an ATM card for shopping

253
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:42,817
Cool

254
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:45,822
You´ve done a lot of shopping

255
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:48,655
Take this stuff upstairs for me

256
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:49,661
- Sure
- Thanks

257
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,388
Bo... Boss

258
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,396
Damn it! Why stammer?

259
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:59,470
No, but... sister Karen spent more
than $200,000 on shopping

260
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,777
More than $200,000... cash?

261
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:09,609
Why did you buy so much?

262
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,683
l´ve bought a watch
and some jewels

263
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:16,449
l don´t want you to lose face
if l go out with you

264
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:20,117
You don´t like...
as l´ve bought too much?

265
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,662
No, but we must forget our past life

266
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:25,824
Be discreet when spending in future

267
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:28,329
l go to fit them on

268
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,264
- Come on
- Good...

269
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,805
Sorry, l´ll pay you back the $200,000

270
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:41,443
lt´s OK, l´ll take it as sauna fee

271
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,747
Can you lend me an extra $100,000?

272
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,749
You need money that badly?

273
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,819
You want to go to Macau?

274
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,889
No, l don´t like gambling

275
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:51,314
l want to bet on horses

276
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:55,157
l want the video tapes and data
of horse racing for the last 2 years

277
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,564
lncluding the draws,
jockeys, dividends

278
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,591
field situations,
family trees of new horses

279
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:01,462
But l don´t want data
from newspapers

280
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,096
l need those professional ones

281
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,236
The most favourite thing in HK...

282
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,272
is that you can win money,
without contacting anyone

283
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:10,938
You can win in horse racing
by just sitting at home

284
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:14,614
There´s hundreds of
millions of dividends this time!

285
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,122
lf no jackpot,
it´s not worth betting

286
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,154
Now the dividend is right

287
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,895
What to bet?
lt´ll soon be closed!

288
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,400
Don´t hurry, let´s sit for a while

289
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:39,298
Hello, what´s the reading for
the grass track?

290
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,442
2.13, it´s sticky track then

291
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:43,842
Thanks

292
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:47,238
Bet on all those that
l haven´t marked on

293
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,472
There´re 6 horses for the first leg

294
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:51,479
and 7 horses for the second leg

295
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,446
and five for the third leg

296
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:55,917
So there´re 7000 bets in total

297
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,449
Each bet is $10, so it´s $70,000

298
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:11,701
lt´s done

299
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:15,998
Why so tired?

300
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,203
Sure, l haven´t slept
for 3 days already

301
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:23,317
You can finish in 30 minutes,
you´re Master Of Gambling

302
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:25,613
Horse racing is indeed statistics

303
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,949
The more effort you put,
the bigger chance to win

304
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:32,225
l never pay attention to
which horse will win

305
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:34,354
but l´ve been ruling out horses
that are going to lose

306
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:38,631
Horses l haven´t marked on must
have a bigger chance to win

307
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,396
You´re very professional

308
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,662
Occasional gambling relies on luck

309
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:46,399
but frequent gambling talks about skills

310
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,243
1, 2, 3, 10...

311
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:53,812
Don´t be nervous

312
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,381
l can´t help, it´s winning soon!

313
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:01,216
1, 2, 3, 10...

314
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,687
Rush...

315
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,184
We´ve won!

316
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:08,826
What about number 7?

317
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:11,194
That ass-hole had a fall!

318
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,764
But you still won Triple Tierce

319
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:15,731
What´s wrong with you?

320
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:17,834
You´ve won Triple Tierce,
you´re not shot

321
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,498
You aren´t excited at all?

322
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:22,038
l´ve studied for days, if l don´t win...

323
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:23,369
l´d better kill myself

324
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,978
l tell you, work with me and you´ll
make big money in horse racing

325
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:29,911
Just let me take all decisions

326
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:37,054
Only $40 million?
And l´m not the only winner?

327
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,652
There´re lots of competent guys, l say

328
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:44,796
Jersy, shall we share the $40 million?

329
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,133
But wouldn´t it be better...
if you teach me?

330
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,802
You can have my half share

331
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:51,963
What do you want me to teach you?

332
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:53,600
Teach me a bit of everything you know

333
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:55,632
What l want to learn
most is flying cards, why?

334
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:57,709
So smart!

335
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:02,346
Flying cards is simple indeed

336
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,885
Just concentrate

337
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,316
your force in a spot

338
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:11,248
First, you must estimate
how many spins it must swirl...

339
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,483
before it reaches the target

340
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:15,387
lt´s about 11 yards to
the target from here

341
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:19,565
This card is 2 by 4
and a half inches

342
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:23,834
l guess it´ll reach
the target with 31 spins

343
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:29,006
Try it

344
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:35,010
lt´s about 10 yards from the target
from here

345
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:37,818
This card is 4 and
a half inches long

346
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,147
lt means it´ll reach
the target with 25 spins

347
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:49,994
Don´t hurried with flying cards

348
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:52,028
You must practise a lot
before you make a success

349
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:55,264
Practise on, ask me
if you have any difficulties

350
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:58,766
But I have... lots of...

351
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:02,606
No way, it must be my nail
that lowered my force

352
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:04,033
l´ll surely make it this time

353
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,548
No way, l must be hungry...

354
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:13,051
and threw it too weakly

355
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:16,555
l´ll make it this time

356
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:25,924
No way, l must have anaemia

357
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:27,032
So l failed in it

358
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:29,297
l use internal energy,
l must make it this time

359
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:31,832
lf l fail again, l´d better die!

360
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:43,376
l won´t use fishing
line again this time!

361
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,110
But l definitely fail
without the fishing line

362
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:48,816
No, l must try other ways!

363
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:57,297
No way, l must be too tired

364
00:24:57,532 --> 00:24:58,556
l must sleep now!

365
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,465
What dream did
l make just then?

366
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,641
l recall now, l saw him!

367
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:55,374
I saw... pig´s skin!

368
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,514
Stop looking on

369
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,886
What is it?

370
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:04,548
Come on, chat with me

371
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,986
Let me look at you

372
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,458
l´m happy

373
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:11,863
Why happy?

374
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,632
As you pamper me

375
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:17,630
l let you suffer too much in the past

376
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:19,838
so l must compensate you

377
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,405
You don´t fear
l´ll spend all your money?

378
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:22,932
l´ll make money
if you spend it all

379
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,777
Have you ever thought about...

380
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:28,844
winning big money again?

381
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:30,306
Then we can retire

382
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,820
How to win big money
again and then retire?

383
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:34,486
Tetsuo

384
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,722
But you´re always against
me competing with him

385
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:38,351
lt´s not the same now

386
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,054
His office takes up
all soccer betting in S.E. Asia

387
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,422
Europe Cup this year
will bring him $3 billion profit

388
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:46,965
Who told you that?

389
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,102
They did

390
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,304
l could always hear their conversation

391
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:58,534
lf you defeat him,
we can take over the office

392
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,507
And lots of people
will make money for you

393
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:08,047
lf so, l can never retire

394
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:13,387
He´ll still come for you,
though you avoid him

395
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,990
Anyway, l don´t want to have
relation with people of this field

396
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,030
Stop it, you will never understand this

397
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:23,201
Karen

398
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:24,266
l go out

399
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,041
Karen

400
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,173
You scare me to death

401
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,371
What´s wrong with Karen?
She looks upset

402
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,884
She wants me to challenge Tetsuo

403
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,285
She´s right with that!

404
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:44,286
And you need her to remind you,
you´re retarded

405
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:48,652
All l want is peaceful life

406
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:51,832
lf you don´t gamble, you mean
you´ll become a gigolo?

407
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:54,023
l´m just joking

408
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:56,303
Don´t you find that Karen...

409
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:58,067
Nothing

410
00:28:58,372 --> 00:28:59,202
What is it?

411
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,202
Help!

412
00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:15,053
Hello?

413
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,187
What to talk business with you

414
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:17,387
Cool, help!

415
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,216
Yeung Kwong, what do you want?

416
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:20,758
Want you to gamble with Tetsuo

417
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,025
Gamble with Tetsuo?

418
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,421
lf you agree...

419
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,925
you can have Karen after the game

420
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:28,628
Yeung Kwong, l agree!

421
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,233
OK, straight guy!

422
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,931
l´ll inform you
the location and time later

423
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:34,303
lt´s a deal

424
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:36,267
Hello!

425
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,947
You can´t avoid this time

426
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:42,440
Defeat Tetsuo and rescue Karen

427
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,666
This aircraft-carrier is
the iron base of Tetsuo...

428
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,396
for taking up bets of soccer
and horse racing of Asia?

429
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:07,937
Right

430
00:30:08,175 --> 00:30:11,372
He bought it from Russia, modified it
and leaves it in highseas

431
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:14,243
so as to receive
satellite signals as well

432
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:17,143
Governments of all
Asian nations can´t deal with it

433
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,809
lf ever small squadron
wants to approach it

434
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:21,984
it´ll shoot a missile
and eliminate them

435
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,532
lt seems to be powerful

436
00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:43,635
Right, or it won´t be
called iron base

437
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:47,175
We might buy such an aircraft-carrier
as toy if we make money in future

438
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,984
l´ve been waiting for
this day for ages

439
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:53,651
Me too

440
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:56,647
You two behave like
whores who long for men

441
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,118
Don´t bullshit, start now

442
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:01,386
Today is the Final of
European Cup Soccer

443
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:03,721
France Vs ltaly

444
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,525
The two heroes are meeting here

445
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:13,273
Audience are also interested in
our final battle as well

446
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,376
Result will be out before dawn

447
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:32,492
To prevent anyone cheating

448
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,124
we´ll record the whole game tonight

449
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:38,759
We also have the honour
of inviting 10 referees

450
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:42,795
So you really stress on the title
of Asian Number One

451
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:12,192
l´ve waited for 3 years

452
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:16,268
Today is the Final
of European Cup Soccer

453
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:20,303
and the time for us
to find out who the winner is

454
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,608
You won´t believe me,
l´ve guessed what he says

455
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:27,837
Therefore you want to bet on Poker
and soccer at the same time?

456
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:31,645
Right, France is giving half goal

457
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,984
l think France has better skills

458
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:36,648
but France will have a hard
match to give half goal to ltaly

459
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:40,520
l bet on ltaly, $50 million

460
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,293
OK

461
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:44,528
Hurry up, Big 2 or Showhand?

462
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:45,829
Baccarat

463
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,668
Make it a serious game,
let the bet decide who will win

464
00:32:50,404 --> 00:32:54,135
$100 million chips for each of you,
you can bet however much you want

465
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:56,967
$100 million? You mean
the number of my sperm?

466
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:58,469
l don´t have so much

467
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:01,239
Silly boy

468
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:04,282
The name of Cool
is already worth a billion

469
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:21,899
No problem

470
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:23,397
No problem with me either

471
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,677
l´ve bet on Player, $10 million

472
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,475
OK, l bet on Banker

473
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:56,633
Blow...

474
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,465
As big as possible

475
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:08,306
8, not bad

476
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:11,710
Both sides 8, a draw

477
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:14,980
First round a draw?
Strange, isn´t it?

478
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:19,620
Silly boy, they mean to be
police for the first round only

479
00:34:21,462 --> 00:34:22,258
You saw it?

480
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:27,267
We manage to remember all card
sequences of 16 sets when shuffling

481
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,797
Now we´ll fight with memory

482
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,799
For the first 10 rounds, the very first
round should be a draw

483
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:36,966
Then the winning sequence will be
Banker, Banker, then Player

484
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:40,078
then Player, Banker, Banker,
Banker, Banker, Banker

485
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:43,944
so... let´s bet $5,000
on Banker at once

486
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:46,045
At least $5 million for it!

487
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:52,155
So l always say if you bet from
time to time...

488
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:53,951
you can then enjoy retiring life

489
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,123
$20 million, on Banker

490
00:34:57,998 --> 00:35:00,796
l bet on Banker too, $20 million

491
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:04,598
Mr. Tetsuo, please read the cards

492
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:11,974
Player 1, Banker 8, Banker wins

493
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:15,474
What´s the point of playing
when you all know the results?

494
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:18,717
Only the last round will
decide who´ll win finally

495
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,914
Because l fail to
see the last card clearly

496
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,510
Yeah!

497
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,119
ltaly wins by 1-0!

498
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:02,720
l´ve said France will have a hard
match if she´s to give half goal!

499
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:06,619
Boss, there´re intruders,
many of our men have died

500
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:11,186
Don´t disturb, it´s the last round!

501
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:11,955
Yes, Boss

502
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:22,899
Mr. Tetsuo, let´s have
another game later

503
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,878
Don´t let those people disturb us

504
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,411
You´ve lost by one point

505
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:30,181
lt seems this is going
to be the last round

506
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:31,783
l´ll bet on Banker

507
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:36,150
So sure?

508
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,890
l´ll believe in luck occasionally

509
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:41,087
OK, l´ll bet on Player then

510
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:48,065
Good, let´s decide
who´ll win with this hand

511
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:51,333
Serve

512
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:54,796
A black card

513
00:37:57,878 --> 00:38:00,278
lt´s now the most critical moment

514
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:12,650
7

515
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:17,189
6 or 7, hit...

516
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,637
1, 2 or 3...

517
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,468
9!

518
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:33,142
5

519
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:36,009
lf the next card isn´t either 3 or 4...

520
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:39,442
No chance then

521
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,223
They´re intruding!

522
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,111
Sorry

523
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,781
Sorry for interfering with your
Poker game, you two idiot

524
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:16,222
Yeung Kwong!

525
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,188
How dare you betray me?

526
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,157
You´re much more stupid than him!

527
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,926
Being an able, smart guy...

528
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,261
l don´t want to work under you

529
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:29,330
You damned fool

530
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:31,595
You both want to
be Asian Number One?

531
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:33,168
l´m Asian Number One!

532
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,273
Yeung Kwong, where´s Karen?

533
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,204
Yeung Kwong, l want a duel with you!

534
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:43,013
Are you OK?

535
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,011
You still miss women at this moment?

536
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:47,847
You haven´t had women for ages?

537
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:51,920
Don´t ever think l´ll let
your woman go as you come

538
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:53,755
Cool...

539
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,354
He kidnapped Karen so as to
force me to gamble with you

540
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,231
l see

541
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:04,134
Your target must be the billions
of cash here

542
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:08,397
l tell you, you can never make it

543
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:12,910
Don´t worry, no one will blinkly
know even if all of you die

544
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:17,112
l´ll spread the news after
l´ve got all the money...

545
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:21,582
that you two idiots die in my hands

546
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:25,322
Get me all the cash
from the safe now!

547
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:28,421
l´m afraid my very last game...

548
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,318
can never finish

549
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:34,828
Don´t move, look at that side

550
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,227
Cool!

551
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:45,701
The soccer match is breathtaking,
l was going to kill you after the match

552
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,670
but l´m afraid of your flying cards

553
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,081
So what shall l do?

554
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:54,476
Therefore l suggest...

555
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,655
chopping it off

556
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,356
1-1 now!

557
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,094
Mighty? lt´s designed to neutralise
your flying cards attack

558
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,506
Cool!

559
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:58,510
You have no more hope

560
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:00,844
You´re not karen

561
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:02,749
When did you notice that?

562
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,257
Because l´ve rescued
your sister from Japan already

563
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,654
Since we returned to HK

564
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:09,388
l notice that you have
a totally different character

565
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:11,557
So l asked Banana to
check at the big house

566
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,159
and we learnt that
your sister was still there

567
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:15,962
Then l pretend to let
nature take it´s course

568
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:17,463
Promise to have a game with Tetsuo

569
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:19,796
and settle the old scores
between Yeung Kwong and me

570
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:42,820
Brother Kwong, we´ve got the money!

571
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:43,827
You leave now!

572
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:56,803
Let´s go

573
00:42:57,377 --> 00:42:58,105
You leave now

574
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:09,585
l´m sorry...

575
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:11,451
to cheat you...

576
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:15,723
l´m sorry l´ve betrayed my sister

577
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:30,033
Cool...

578
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:35,077
What is the last card?

579
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:46,824
You´ve won

580
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:48,661
lt´s an Ace

581
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:17,553
Wait!

582
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:21,087
Wait...

583
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,922
l must die anyway...

584
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:26,957
so can you just give me a chance?
Just once!

585
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:42,405
Then I... will die with no regret

586
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:01,591
l´ve made it!

587
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:04,327
l´m the King Of
The World lnternational!

588
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,776
Cool

589
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:22,255
Cool

590
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,853
l´ll see which is faster,
your flying card or a missile

591
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:26,826
How many second you run 100 metres?

592
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:28,586
What? What catties of rice?

593
00:47:31,117 --> 00:47:32,015
Let´s run!

594
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:14,385
Kill him!

595
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,427
Kill him!

596
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:29,500
Cool!

597
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:33,304
We´re real buddies, let´s do it together!

598
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,574
Accompany me, let´s do it together!

599
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:39,311
Big challenge!

600
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:46,321
Together, accompany me!

601
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,627
Together...

602
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:49,860
Take off!

603
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:05,673
Run faster! The propeller is stuck,
it´ll explode soon!

604
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:28,023
lt was generous of you
to burn all the money, thanks

605
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:29,562
lt was a big challenge for me

606
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:33,298
But sometimes for the sake of friends...

607
00:49:33,706 --> 00:49:34,968
l´ll take money as shit

608
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:38,340
Frankly speaking,
your thank is very worthy

609
00:49:39,913 --> 00:49:40,811
Hubby!

610
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:45,079
Honey!

611
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:46,343
l miss you so much!

612
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,248
Let me show you something

613
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:48,476
- No
- you better give me a kiss

614
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:49,882
- l miss you so much
- Take a look now

615
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:50,988
- No
- You´ll be cheered once you see it

616
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:51,885
No! Just look at me

617
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:54,424
Give me a kiss,
l´ve missed you so much

618
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:55,424
l beg you

619
00:49:55,595 --> 00:49:56,186
Just a kiss?

620
00:49:56,362 --> 00:49:57,158
Yes, just a kiss!

621
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,966
Karen

622
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,141
Nothing can separate us anymore

623
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:20,951
You bitch, you break
the capillaries on my lips

624
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:24,021
l´m not cheating you,
l only want one kiss

625
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:39,496
Very romantic!

626
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:45,105
Let´s leave

627
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:54,418
Jersy!

628
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:17,805
France finally won by 2-1 that evening

629
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:19,007
Therefore l always say...

630
00:51:19,212 --> 00:51:20,804
nothing is impossible in this world

631
00:51:21,314 --> 00:51:23,942
That night was the last time
l saw Cool and Karen

632
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:25,846
And they haven´t been seen since then

633
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,616
l wish them a happy ending

634
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:30,750
And l, Jersy, will definitely become
the most powerful Master Of Gambling

635
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:32,182
Come to challenge me if you dare

636
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:33,859
you can never pay back
though you become gigolo

637
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,888
Laughing?
