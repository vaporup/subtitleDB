1
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,185
[Man] Of course,
women have always been a vital link...

2
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,397
in the lifeline
that supplies combat units.

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,733
The last few years have brought
real progress...

4
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,194
in the interests of women in
all aspects of naval service.

5
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,365
What's more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses...

6
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,577
for all its male recruits,
demonstrating even more progress–—

7
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Mr. Hayes.

8
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,916
If a cannibal used a knife and fork,
would you call that progress too?

9
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,294
[Observers Laughing]

10
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:30,131
Well, perhaps, if I could just finish,
Madame Chairman, your questions–—

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,925
Oh, I'm just an old dame
without much time left...

12
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,803
so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here.

13
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:40,183
I'm deeply concerned over the Navy's
seemingly incontrovertible attitude...

14
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,311
toward women in the military.

15
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,022
- Case in point: the Lark Report.
- [Murmuring]

16
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,944
Uh, Madame Chairman, this is
an internal document of the U.S. Navy.

17
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:56,699
The Navy's analysis of that F-14 crash
at Coronado last year.

18
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,494
Female aviator,
it just so happens.

19
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,997
You were party to this report.
Am I right?

20
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,000
I am really not prepared
to go into an in-depth–—

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,837
If you are vying for the office
of the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Hayes...

22
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,964
I'd like to think
you were prepared for anything.

23
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,716
[Observers Murmuring]

24
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,052
Especially if you're lookin'
for my confirmation.

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,556
I'm struck by the ill-spirited
tenor of your report:

26
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,809
degrading remarks
by other aviators...

27
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,813
innuendo about her performance
in unrelated situations.

28
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,566
There's even a reference here to
her sexual activity the weekend prior.

29
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,195
[Hayes] These are not
unrelated circumstances.

30
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,197
In my seven years
on this committee...

31
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,742
I have never seen a downed aviator
treated like this, never.

32
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,831
I'm deeply disturbed
by this report, Mr. Hayes.

33
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,376
Not just what it bodes
for the future of women in the Navy...

34
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,338
but your future as well.

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,467
Do you expect to take criticism
for using this confirmation hearing...

36
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,678
as a pulpit
for women's rights?

37
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,764
Look, nearly one-quarter of
all jobs in the U.S. military...

38
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,017
are still to this day off-limits
to women, and that has gotta change!

39
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,021
What about those that say women aren't
suited for all jobs, they're physically weaker?

40
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,023
How strong do you have to be
to pull a trigger?

41
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,235
That was quick.
Yeah, she did great.

42
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,863
Are you kidding?
She's always great.

43
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,698
Private meeting.
That's what we want.

44
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,702
Are you worried about the next round
of base closures, Senator?

45
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,788
- As long as it doesn't affect me.
- Defense boys already called.

46
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,790
[Sighs] They want
a private meeting with you.

47
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,917
I'll act surprised.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,137
Senator, this is a contingency program
for 100 per cent integration.

49
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,308
If female candidates measure e up
in a series of test cases...

50
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:50,313
the D.O.D. will support full
integration within three year's time.

51
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,316
We get our man. You get
your gender -blind Navy, Senator.

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,651
Surely you’re e not gonna
balk at that.

53
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,070
I have to pick
the test cases.

54
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,323
The Navy'll want approval
over the women.

55
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,242
- So I'll approve their approval.
- [Chuckling] Come on, Senator.

56
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,914
Let's concentrate on the steak
and not the peas.

57
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,125
If women measure e up to the men, they've
got the job. That's what's on the table.

58
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,671
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

59
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,848
- Well, Doug?
- Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.

60
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,267
So, what program?

61
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,646
I'd go C.R.T.
Combined Reconnaissance Team.

62
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,106
SEALS.
Sixty per cent dropout r ate.

63
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,651
No woman's gonna last a week.
I don't care who she is.

64
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,111
Then I suggest
we start there.

65
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,280
[Hayes]
Good work.

66
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,492
[Man] Hostile activity.
Mined area.

67
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,161
I say again:
hostile activity, mined area.

68
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,122
Maintaining holding action.

69
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,124
- Carrying one wounded.
- [Phone Ringing]

70
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,878
Extracting to new location
secondary P.Z. Over.

71
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,506
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,633
Negative
on secondary rendezvous.

73
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,512
Strongly suggest new location.
Over.

74
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,723
[Bravo Six] Stand by, Avalanche.
Will consult team leader.

75
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,017
[Static Over Headphones]

76
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,853
- [Avalanche] Bravo Six.
- Go to sea level.

77
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,815
Say again your last.
Over.

78
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,568
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

79
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,240
Bravo Six.

80
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,242
- We've lost the horizon.
- Bravo Six.

81
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,537
- You didn't account for that?
- Yes, sir, we did...

82
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,206
but we didn't count on the SEAL unit
being delayed for five hours...

83
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,709
and then exfiltrating
this close to this high terrain.

84
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:39,005
But Keyhole-5 will be L.O.S.
in 18 minutes, sir.

85
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,507
Launch base will need
that much time to key their gear.

86
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,843
Advise launch base
accordingly, Goldstein. Now.

87
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,220
Sir, I'd recommend against it.
These are skilled operators.

88
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,765
They've grasped their problem by now and
will take action to get back on-line.

89
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,184
It’s just a glitch
in the net changeover, sir.

90
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,061
I'll have it ironed out
momentarily.

91
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,356
Advise launch base,
Goldstein.

92
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,026
Something to add,
Lieutenant?

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,238
If we keep the primary satellite, the unit can
negotiate its way down to this plateau here.

94
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,282
Reestablish comms.
It's a clear shot.

95
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,910
What about those two areas inland?
That's closer to their position.

96
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,038
But that's behind them.

97
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,206
They'll wanna keep moving
seaward, sir, yet find a spot...

98
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,375
that gives 'em the line of sight
on the satellite.

99
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,045
This plateau here.
That's where I'd head, sir.

100
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,716
Last I checked, you were a topographic
analyst, not an operations specialist.

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,385
- Why don't you just let it–—
- If they have wounded...

102
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,596
they might be inclined
to stay put.

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,973
Wait till the new bird
comes into L.O.S.

104
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,143
But they also know the tides are
slipping out under their recovery sub.

105
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,897
They'll hump their wounded out. They'll
reach this plateau in ten minutes.

106
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,066
Make that nine now.

107
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,235
We can't switch the net, sir.
We'll be listening for them...

108
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,572
on the wrong channel
with the wrong crypto.

109
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,244
Give it exactly nine minutes.

110
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,976
[Phone Ringing]

111
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,437
Okay, let's see
what the cat dragged in.

112
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,523
They've preapproved
all these candidates.

113
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,525
Top scores, marksmanship.

114
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,445
Distance runner. Took fifth place
in some intra-service marathon. Age 27.

115
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,949
Perfect, till they do
a chromosome check.

116
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,618
Some impressive
fitness reps here.

117
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,539
Holder of several records
for female power-lifting.

118
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,208
Is this the face you want to see
on the cover of Newsweek?

119
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,794
She looks like the wife
of a Russian beet farmer.

120
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,796
I like this one.

121
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,966
Triathlon, winter sports,
Olympic contender...

122
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,468
winner of the Arlie Burke
essay contest, works Intel.

123
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:54,181
- Too much of a think-tank soldier.
- No, no, show me, show me.

124
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,815
Well, this really is
top drawer...

125
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,026
with silk stockings inside.

126
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,324
- We've waited about as long as we dare.
- Do it.

127
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,410
Change the net.

128
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,496
Launch base,
this is N.I.C. control.

129
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,167
We're going to conduct
a net changeover...

130
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,211
to Keyhole-5 at
the following coordinates.

131
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,380
This is Bravo Six.
Still got six heartbeats here...

132
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,507
holding on some kind of plateau.

133
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,887
I say again, six passengers
looking for a ride home.

134
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,222
- We're good to go.
- Belay my last.

135
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:40,936
Copy that. Maintain perimeter.
Advise further hostile status.

136
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,905
- That was good headwork, Lieutenant.
- Well, thank you, sir.

137
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,324
I'm glad we could get
involved and do some good.

138
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,036
Now the problem is,
Intel officers don't get involved.

139
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,331
We monitor, analyze.

140
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,042
You need to learn
the fine art of detachment, Lieutenant.

141
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,711
[Woman] Excuse me, there's a call
from the Sec Nav's office.

142
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,546
- I'll take it inside.
- No, sir, excuse me.

143
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,715
Lieutenant O'Neil,
the call's for you.

144
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,259
I'll take it inside.

145
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,973
[Woman] Thanks for holding.
I'll put you through.

146
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,663
[Clock Ticking, Chiming]

147
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,084
I'm thinking about redoing
the place.

148
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,337
It's beginning to remind me
of an old whorehouse over the years.

149
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,674
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Lieutenant.

150
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,676
Ma'am, may I ask
what this is regarding?

151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,178
- Didn't they tell you?
- No, ma'am.

152
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,181
Well, this'll be a toot.
You read, I'll pour.

153
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,614
[Liquid Pouring]

154
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,998
It's jus t a test case, Jordan...

155
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,042
but if things work out,
if you can go the distance...

156
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:32,214
it could well change the military's
official policy on women in combat.

157
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,051
Or, actually,
its official non-policy.

158
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,847
Begging your pardon,
Senator...

159
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,183
but you do understand this
involves SEAL training?

160
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,978
I do.
I also understand...

161
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,481
that you applied for active duty
during the Gulf War and got turned down.

162
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,569
Yes, ma'am, there was an Intel slot
available aboard the U.S.S. Polk...

163
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,156
but they told me that submarines
had no bathroom facilities for women.

164
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,826
- Did that piss you off?
- Yes, ma'am, it did.

165
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,079
Good. I like pissed off.

166
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,418
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
- Yes, ma'am.

167
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,552
Have you got a man?

168
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,430
- Ma'am?
- At home?

169
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,517
Fiancé. Steady beau. You know,
some kind of solid heterosexual.

170
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,605
I hate askin', but I don't want
this thing blowin' up in our faces...

171
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,857
if you happen to be battin'
for the other side.

172
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,610
Yes, ma'am, there's someone.

173
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,404
Well, wonderful.

174
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,537
Honey, come on'. I survived jump school,
dive school and three brothers.

175
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,539
I think I can take care
of myself '.

176
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,751
The only thing that scares me
are the sexual politics.

177
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,421
I'm just not interested in being
some poster girl for women's rights.

178
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,760
- What?
- Hmm?

179
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,221
- What?
- What?

180
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,807
You don't have anything
to say about this?

181
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,643
I guess I don't.

182
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,146
Honey, this is just
a career opportunity.

183
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,732
You don't want me sleeping my way
to the top, do you?

184
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,776
But the SEALS, babe?

185
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,278
These guys are world-class warriors.
They see you coming–—

186
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,406
- I mean–—
- I'm aware they may not want me there.

187
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,074
- "May not"?
- Yes.

188
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,744
They will eat corn flakes
out of your skull. Okay?

189
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,206
To tell you the truth...

190
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,417
I don't get it.

191
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,752
I mean, you're doing
shit-hot at Intel'.

192
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,005
Why do you wanna go off
and play soldier girl for?

193
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,512
[Sighs]

194
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,515
Royce, we're the same age.
We entered the Navy the same month.

195
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,934
Which one of us
is wearing more ribbons?

196
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,187
Oh, come on. This is just 'cause
I got lucky during the Gulf War.

197
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,107
Yes, thank you'. Operational experience
is a key to advancement.

198
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,111
Yet anyone with tits can't be on a sub,
can't be a SEAL, and don't even think–—

199
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,113
Hey, whoa.
If you made up your mind to do it, go.

200
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,200
You always do what you wanna do anyway.
Don't ask my permission.

201
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:10,122
You wanna go off and live with a bunch of
cock-swinging commandos for three months–—

202
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,124
Three months?

203
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,170
What if I make this and go operational
for three years? What then?

204
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,840
Oh, man, did I just miss
a decade or something?

205
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,968
Will I wait if you go off to war?
Is that what you're asking me?

206
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,181
Yeah, something like that.
Exactly like that.

207
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,185
I didn't know I was gonna have to decide
the rest of my life tonight, Jordan.

208
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,228
Maybe we should just
let this happen.

209
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,149
Get your dick back in here.

210
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,153
Don't ask me to tell you how I'm gonna
feel in three years. I don't know.

211
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,155
I mean, neither do you.

212
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,158
Right up until you said that,
I thought I did.

213
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:53,248

216
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,278
Carry on.

Put it down! Here we go!

[Trainees Shouting]

219
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,809
Lieutenant O'Neil
reporting for training, sir.

220
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,907
Yes, of course.

221
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,910
Please, Lieutenant,
have a seat.

222
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,954
Thank you, sir.

223
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,628
Would you care for a beverage?
Tea? Soda?

224
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,299
- I'm fine, sir.
- You sure?

225
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,762
Well, we're still coming to
terms with the exact protocol...

226
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,765
for the integration
of our SEAL C.R.T. training.

227
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,769
- Barber was my next stop, sir. l–—
- Don't worry about it.

228
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,940
As long as it's off your collar, out of
your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.

229
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,860
Sir, I'm not looking
for any special treatment.

230
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,238
We're not trying to change
your sex, Lieutenant.

231
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,450
You'll have a separate bed,
a separate head.

232
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,661
If you have any special medical needs,
inform the infirmary.

233
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:58,290
If your classmates or a superior
acts in a harassing...

234
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,626
or otherwise unbecoming manner...

235
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,211
you are to inform me
immediately...

236
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,339
so that I can deal with it
immediately.

237
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,634
It may not always run smooth...

238
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,803
but we're trying to make it
as painless as possible.

239
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,724
Thank you, sir, but I expect
a certain amount of pain.

240
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,228
- Any questions?
- None at this time, sir.

241
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,856
Then we're done, Lieutenant.

242
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,900
Yes, sir.

243
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,237
Permission to speak, sir?

244
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,825
I'm not here to make
some kind of statement.

245
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,496
I care about completing the training
and getting operational experience...

246
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,581
just like everyone else,
I suspect.

247
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,834
If you were like everyone else,
Lieutenant...

248
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,171
I suspect we wouldn't be
making statements...

249
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,215
about not making statements...

250
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,009
would we?

251
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,595
- Dismissed.
- Aye-aye, sir.

252
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,298
Come on.

253
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,128
Average woman, 25 percent body fat.
Twenty-five.

254
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,590
That's a quarter fat, man.
I mean, think about that.

255
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,550
If she pulls her own weight,
I got no problem with it.

256
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,262
No split-tail's getting through
this program. No way, Jose.

it's rude to point?

- Whoo-hoo!
- [Man Whistles]

260
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,410
Look, I don't know what she did
to get in here. I hate to speculate.

261
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,789
I know I petitioned for two years
to get into this program.

262
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,791
Two years of letter writing,
two years of pulling strings...

263
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,709
and I finally get here,
and it's gone co-ed?

264
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:52,672
Elite combat unit.
Whose genius idea was that?

265
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,842
That's bullshit. I mean, they can't do
what we can. How's it happen?

266
00:18:55,927 --> 00:19:00,347
All I'm sayin' is one night, Lord. Give
me one night, and I'll set her straight.

267
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:05,185
[Together] Slovnik's feeling good
like a hard man should.

268
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,022
Stow it, gentlemen.
You heard the policy.

269
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,732

Welcome to SEAL C.R.T.
selection program.

273
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,687
You have volunteered for
the most intensive military training...

275
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:55,360

281
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,337
In spite of your expertise...

282
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:19,426
many of you will not successfully
negotiate this program.

283
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,389
Those that do will experience
an operational tempo...

284
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:29,394
that far exceeds that of any unit
within the U.S. arsenal.

285
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,855
That is all
that is to be said...

286
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:36,401
about the special nature
of the C.R.T. training program.

287
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,738
I now turn you over...

00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,944
I never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself

A bird will fall frozen dead
from a bough...

sorry for itself.

622

If so, I regard that
as a bona fide brain fart...

Yes, Master Chief

So, what was the deal you made

- Oooh.
- Didn't you hear?

Effective immediately,

Oh, man.

725
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,572
Not playing down to the abilities
of your superior officer, are you?

726
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,741
No, sir. Snooker’s just
not my game.

727
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,743
Too many balls
on the table.

728

Distracting, isn't it? That one
pink ball right in the middle.

- Who's got a cigar?
- Didn't know you smoked, sir.

the hell out of it.

734

These were supposed to have been

milk this cow on all four tits.

Where is she in the training,
this woman?

741
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:15,173
We'll have that information
for you before the night's out.

742
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:20,136
It's my understanding that she just
finished the P.T. phase of her training.

743

She made it
through hell week.

745
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,436
So, have you been monitoring
this situation for us, Commander?

746
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:32,315
No, sir. I just made
some unofficial inquiries.

00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,818
Well, make it official.

748
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:39,030
I want a brief back in my office
once a week.

Captain Salem here.

755
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,021
Are you in the habit of lettin'
photographers traipse around your base...

756
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,023
snapping their fill?

757
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,151
These are supposed to be
discreet test cases.

758
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:21,072
Senator, they stand out on a
public highway using telephoto lenses.

759
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,075
There is nothin'
I can do about it...

unless you want me to infringe
on their civil liberties...

which I'll be glad to do if you’ll just
trim a little fat off the Constitution.

00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,879
Did you just mouth off to a senior
member of the Senate Arms Committee?

763
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,257
I'll give you points for style,
just nothin' for smarts.

- From this point forward, I want all press matters...

for this one.

I'll be sure to pass your request along
to my chain of command.

00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,192
Good.

771
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,653
Now, how's my girl
doin', anyway?

772
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,909
You need to know
what it feels like to drown...

773
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,120
in order
to avoid panic...

774
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,874
and perhaps gain those few seconds
that just might save your life.

775
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:17,086
The natural tendency
toward premature panic...

776
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,423
is what makes this such an effective
interrogation technique.

Nothing more than a chopped-down

By taking the proper
precautions...

784
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,782
this weapon can be considered
water-resistant.

785
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,494
Many techniques have been developed
to seal the muzzle of the weapon.

786
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,829
Nothing, however, surpasses
the technique developed in my time.

will the sea have seen or not seen me?

- [Groans] A little bit.
- Okay, you can get dressed.

It's called amenorrhea

It's because you drop body fat, but
not at all unusual for female athletes.

and yours.

1168
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:45,006
Her presence
makes us all vulnerable.

1169
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:49,344
I don't want you learning
that inconvenient fact...

[Man On Telephone] She just made it
through S.E.R.E. training.

1191

- Goddamn, that girl is good.

Oh, by the way, Newsweek called.

1193

- They want to do a cover story on you and G.I. Jane.
- Wonderful news, Peter.

1194
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:26,149
Let's talk about this when I get back
to the office. Thank you, darling.

1196
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:33,072
Great. They can come take your picture
at the retirement home in Waco.

1198

D.O.D. tried this trick with Resnik in
California five years ago and it worked.

1199

He was not re-elected.
You want that to happen in Texas?

1200

Douglas, nothing's final
till you see it on CNN.

1201
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,838
There's a reason
they gave you that hit list.

1202
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,466
You think they want a horse trade?

1203
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,969
I think they're waitin' for your call.

Hey.

1205
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:18,618
Hi, O'Neil. I would've paid money
to have been there.

1206

- Oh, you heard, huh?
- I think it was on the evening news.

1207

I need–— more P.R.

gonna go over to the beach.

1209
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,923
It’s just a barbecue. No big deal.
You wanna come along?

1210
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,385
Well, actually, my crew
has invited me out for a drink.

Ooh, progress.

Well, however slow, however painful,
I think they're coming around.

- You saw Flea?
- Yeah.

1219
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,540
- How's he doin'?
- Think his leg's gonna heal all right.

1220
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,834
I don't know about
the rest of him.

1221
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,836
He went out on medical.
They'll roll him back through.

1222
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,838
Yeah, well,
they may let him back...

1223
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:14,340
but I don't know if
they'll let him finish.

1224
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:17,009
If they want you out,
man, they'll find a way.

1225
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,013
- I'm still here.
- Hoo-yah! Great job.

- Hey.
- Lieutenant, they're waiting.

1273
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:02,944
This is Admiral Gallow
and Lieutenant Burke...

1274
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:06,447
from the Judge Advocate
General's office.

1275
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,741
Have a seat, Lieutenant.

1276
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:12,536
I don't know, uh, a delicate way
to say this, Lieutenant...

1277
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,538
so I'm not going to try.

1278
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:18,626
Claims have been made
that you have, uh...

1279
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:24,090
engaged in fraternization
of the same sex variety.

1280
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,634
Specifically that you were...

1281
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:30,805
"seen in public venues with another
female officer at a time and manner...

1282
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,683
as to suggest conduct
unbecoming an officer."

1283
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:38,771
Sir, is someone suggesting
that I'm a lesbian?

1284
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:41,732
We're not asking
if you are, Lieutenant...

1285
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,901
and you're not required
to respond even if asked.

1286
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:46,153
This is merely an informal inquiry.

1287
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,739
Where did you get these?

1288
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,742
The source of these photographs
is also a part of our investigation.

1289
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:56,580
I see. They were
sent anonymously.

1290
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:59,792
Sir, I'd like to tell you that
this is completely groundless...

1291
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,796
and in no way did anything happen
with Lt. Blondell and myself.

1292
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,174
I find this just as distasteful
as you, Lieutenant.

1293
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,510
You will be required...

1294
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:13,180
to cooperate with JAG and N.I.S.

1295
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,267
Naturally, you will be given a desk
pending the outcome.

1296
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,436
A desk?
Oh, this is–—

1297
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,149
Captain, obviously someone is trying
to sabotage my training.

1298
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:25,317
You may repeat your training...

1299
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:27,653
at a future date, if cleared.

1300
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:31,032
- I can't go through this shit again.
- Ratchet down, Lieutenant.

1301
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,952
I would not choose
to repeat the training, sir...

1302
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,329
nor do I care
to drive a desk...

1303
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:40,249
pending the outcome of
this malicious allegation.

1304
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:44,879
Now, I respectfully request you keep me
with my crew or you send me packing.

1305
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:49,050
That sounded dangerously
like an ultimatum.

1306
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:52,219
You take it as you will, sir.

1307
01:29:55,182 --> 01:29:58,893

01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:57,344
and all to myself.

1328
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,350
[Sighs]
But you'd be hell to live with.

1329
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:06,353
[Both Laughing]

1330
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:22,244
[Whispers]
I love you.

1331
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,511
Okay. Here it is.

1332
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:47,603
- Take a look at these.
- Switch ya.

1333
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:58,697
Now, this was faxed
to the JAG office Tuesday.

1334
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:01,200
Arrived on my desk
Wednesday morning.

1335
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:05,079
- What do you see?
- [Thunder Rumbling]

1336
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,122
You see this?

1337
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:15,130
What do you see?

1338
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:20,094
Take a look on the right.

1339
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,388
- [Jordan] Shit.
- That's right.

1340
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,352
How important is this
to you, Jordan?

1341
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:34,066
I'm just asking.
I'm just asking.

1342
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:04,138
- [Man On! TV] Bridgeport Naval Base.
- Wait. Look at this.

1343
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:08,892
In Tennessee, the board recommends
closing Fort Meyers...

1344
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:11,645
and the Brantwood
Air Force Supply Depot.

1345
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:15,983
In Texas, the board is recommending
no closures of military bases.

1346
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:19,320
Last week, five bases in Texas were
on the chopping block. This week, none.

1347
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:22,406
What does that tell you?

1348
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,326
...in a manner equitable
to all states...

1349
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,454
while burdening no one state
with economic hardship.

1350
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,831
First and foremost...

1351
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:33,792
this commission worked
for the good of the country.

1352
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:39,089
Of course, we anticipate
some controversy...

1353
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,258
over our recommendations.

1354
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:44,345
But we remind everybody–—
Senators, Congressmen...

1355
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:47,348
- Governors alike–—
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Burnham.

1356
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:50,517
Now might be a dandy time
for that recess.

1357
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,312
Till noon, everyone.

1358
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,401
Jordan, I heard what happened...

1359
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:01,737
and I do so very much
want to talk with you...

1360
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,781
but now is scarcely the time.

1361
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:07,034
I commend you, Senator.
Those were very nice photos.

1362
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:12,498
Yes, we did have someone
taking shots...

1363
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:15,959
but for future
publicity purposes.

1364
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:19,254
I see. So how did they end up
in the Navy's hands?

1365
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,757
Well, you'll have to ask them that.

1366
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:26,053
If I have to ask
anyone again, Senator...

1367
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,055
I'll be asking on C-SPAN.

1368
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:33,977
Jordan. Come on.

1369
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:38,190
[Man] Here are the Senator's
case notes.

1370
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,317
[DeHaven] Let me have it, boys.
Come on. Quickly, quickly.

1371
01:35:40,402 --> 01:35:42,319
Close the door.

1372
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:56,083
Jordan, nearly every working day
I'm forced to make decisions...

1373
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,461
that would have Solomon himself
shittin' golf balls...

1374
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:02,256
and half of those decisions
are about political survival.

1375
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,758
I don't resent that.

1376
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:08,262
So if you’ve come here lookin' for me
to apologize for keeping alive...

1377
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:11,682
you better pull up a chair,
'cause you're gonna be here for a while.

1378
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:16,937
Tell me you didn't sell me out.

1379
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:21,066
Tell me you didn't sink my whole career
to make you look good.

1380
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:24,069
Those charges will be dismissed.

1381
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:28,407
Your career will go forward,
albeit back here in Washington.

1382
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:31,618
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you wanted that kind of life.

1383
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:34,246
Squat-pissing in some
third-world jungle...

1384
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,623
with some guys
looking up your behind.

1385
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:40,878
I wanted the choice.
That's how it's supposed to be.

1386
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:44,590
The truth is, the choice isn't yours,
and it isn't mine.

1387
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,592
American families
are just not prepared...

1388
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:50,387
to have their daughters
and young mothers in harm's way.

1389
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:53,307
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

1390
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:55,642
Roper, Paris, Gallup, all the polls,
they all come back the same way.

1391
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:57,644
What are you saying?

1392
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:02,149
That a woman's life
is more valuable than a man's?

1393
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:06,236
That a woman's death
is more hurtful than a man's?

1394
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:10,741
No politician can afford to let women
come home in body bags...

1395
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,743
especially me.

1396
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,917
It was never gonna happen anyway.

1397
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,632
Then why the fuck did you start me
on all this in the first place?

1398
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:30,093
Truthfully?

1399
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:35,766
I never expected you to do so damn well.
I thought you'd ring out in two weeks.

1400
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:39,269
Bing, bang, it's over,
and we're popular.

1401
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,650
- [Door Opens, Closes]
- In Washington...

1402
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:48,028
you don't even need the Ten Commandments
if you’re popular.

1403
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:57,663
I wonder what Secretary Hayes
would think about this...

1404
01:37:57,747 --> 01:37:59,873
if he was to know
how you dealt me away...

1405
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:03,669
for bases, for votes.

1406
01:38:03,753 --> 01:38:07,506
What makes you think
he doesn't know?

1407
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,805
Don't even think about playing politics
with me, little darling.

1408
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,807
You'll be up way past your bedtime.

1409
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:20,352
And don't you think that
I will stand idly by...

1410
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:24,064
while anyone smears
my good name.

1411
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:29,152
Now, you get those charges voided,
Senator, and you do it today.

1412
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,405
Or what?

1413
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:34,366
You like pissed off?

1414
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,952
Watch this.

1415
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:43,417
Jordan, you're asking me
to unring a bell.

1416
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,419
- I cannot do that.
- I'm not asking.

1417
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:48,714
Think about what you do before you go in
front of cameras and embarrass yourself.

1418
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,758
- You have no proof!
- Accusations seem to be enough.

1419
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:55,095
- You taught me that.
- Jordan!

1420
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:58,181
Hell of a game
of brinkmanship you play.

1421
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:00,726
I'm not playing games, Senator.

1422
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,936
I gather.

1423
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:11,194
I'll do it.

1424
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,324
Somehow, I'll get you back in.

1425
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,631
[Wickwire]
Hey, guys.

1426
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,884
Guys, come here. Take a look at this.
Look who's back in town.

1427
01:39:36,054 --> 01:39:38,305
Lieutenant. Come here.

1428
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:46,313
I don't know what the hell's
been going on in the last 48 hours.

1429
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,441
Frankly, I don't give a shit.

1430
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,485
Good to see you too,
Master Chief.

1431
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:56,323
Check out who's back, man.

1432
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:59,993
- Mr. Wickwire!
- Yes, Master Chief?

1433
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:02,829
Since the whole world
seems to be awake at 0500...

1434
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:05,248
why don't you get your class
out here and into formation.

1435
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,668
Might as well
crank it up right now.

1436
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,462
All right, Master Chief
You guys heard him. Let's rock and roll.

1437
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:17,552
- Ready for round two?
- Hoo-yah, Master Chief.

1438
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:38,990
- Ready for me? [Laughing]
- You fuck!

1439
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:42,744
Hey, Newberry, you ever done
one of these...

1440
01:40:42,829 --> 01:40:46,540
Operational Readiness
Exercises before?

1441
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:49,292
No, Slovnik.
Never operated in the Med.

1442
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,878
Well, it ain't exactly dangerous,
unless you're caught.

1443
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:55,716
Even though the officials know
we're comin' to test security...

1444
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,218
homeboys guarding the power station
don't know shit.

1445
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:01,221
Hey, McCool, remember that guy
that got caught...

1446
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:03,223
settin' charges on the oil platform
years back?

1447
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,892
I don't know, man. What?
Thomas? Taylor? I don't know.

1448
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:09,813
Well, he tried to explain
it was just an exercise.

1449
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:13,358
Well, he was talking English and
they was talkin' Arabic. So, you know.

1450
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:15,861
- Did he die in prison or–-
- I don't know.

1451
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:18,822
Well, I hope you assholes are
as ready as you think you are.

1452
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:21,742
You girls are so full of shit.
No offense, O'Neil.

1453
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,744
Jordan, what do you think
about that, huh?

1454
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:26,163
Spending time
in some Arab prison.

1455
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:29,875
After six months with you, Slovnik,
I might just fucking volunteer.

1456
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:33,754
- [Alarm Blaring]
- [P.A.] Now hear this. Now hear this.

1457
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:37,466
This is the Captain speaking. We have been
directed to break from training exercises...

1458
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:40,761
and join the battle group Tango Chaser.

1459
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:43,388
We are proceeding
towards hostile waters.

1460
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:47,100
Department heads make ready
for battle conditions.

1461
01:41:47,185 --> 01:41:49,102
That is all.

1462
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:52,773
- Iran or Iraq?
- Libya.

1463
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:55,609
At 0230, A D.O.D. satellite
dropped out of orbit.

1464
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,736
Normally, that's not
a cause for such concern...

1465
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,656
except this baby decided to drop
in Mr. Gadhafi's backyard.

1466
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:05,660
What's more, I've got a range
of search units–— Task Unit Scorpion–—

1467
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:08,580
already en route
to the strike zone.

1468
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:13,293
My problem is that their exit plan
has gone to total shit.

1469
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:16,254
Your C.R.T.'s are the closest unit
with the right capabilities.

1470
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:19,132
Your job would be
to facilitate extraction.

1471
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:22,177
Now, Master Chief,
if for one second...

1472
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:25,847
you don't think they're ready for
whatever reason, you speak to me now.

1473
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:30,602
- We'll be fine, sir.
- Excellent.

1474
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:37,234
At present, we are three miles
off the Libyan coast... here.

1475
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:40,487
Carrier support will remain
within striking distance.

1476
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:42,489
Their call sign is Las Vegas.

1477
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:46,326
Now, your unit is to make an
over-the-beach insertion here...

1478
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:49,496
link up with the Ranger Recovery
Unit Scorpion...

1479
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:52,499
and escort them out
without being detected.

1480
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:56,002
Have the Rangers recovered
the device yet, Skipper?

1481
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,171
Satellite power cells
have been located.

1482
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:00,173
They're humping 'em out
now as we speak.

1483
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:02,425
[Man On Radio] Scorpion Leader,
Scorpion Leader.

1484
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,427
This is Las Vegas.

1485
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:09,975
Be advised:
extract team under way.

1486
01:43:10,059 --> 01:43:14,020
Advise your E.T.A.
Over.

1487
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:16,022
Copy, Las Vegas.
Copy, Las Vegas.

1488
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:18,358
E.T. A approximately
one hour, 20 minutes.

1489
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:21,987
- Over.
- [On P.A.] Copy that, Scorpion Leader.

1490
01:43:22,071 --> 01:43:24,948
Be advised rendezvous
point of extraction team...

1491
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:30,370
at the following coordinates:
3-2-1-5, 1-4-8-6.

1492
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:32,372
I say again, 3–—

1493
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,625
Are we talking the KH family here, sir?
The subhunter satellite?

1494
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,794
Go ahead, Lieutenant. Fill us in.

1495
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:42,382
The KH-12 Bravos
are nuclear-powered.

1496
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:45,385
The onboard plutonium
is designed to survive re-entry.

1497
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:48,179
Some kind of
protective shroud.

1498
01:43:48,264 --> 01:43:51,474
The plutonium
is, uh, weapons grade.

1499
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:53,518
[Sighs] You know the drill,
Master Chief.

1500
01:43:53,603 --> 01:43:55,729
- Unfortunately, I do, Skipper.
- Carry on.

1501
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:05,322
Who's not ready?

1502
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,666
Inner door dogged.

1503
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:19,669
[Man On Radio] Understand.
Inner door closed and dogged.

1504
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:24,215
Mark and start.

1505
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:08,426
- Clear. Clear.
- [Jordan] Clear.

1506
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,428
[Chief] Okay. Mr. McCool,
set up comms.

1507
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:16,017
Lieutenant,
let's go find 'em.

1508
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,652
[Man]
Set up a perimeter.

1509
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:49,175
Lieutenant.

1510
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,636
9-0-1 's. Two o'clock.

1511
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:54,014
Got it.

1512
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,191
I still hold four.

1513
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,953
Holy shit!

1514
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:24,544
Border patrol.
A little ratty-assed, but still.

1515
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:27,839
Yeah, parked right in the middle
of the extract corridor.

1516
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:31,468
I got 25, maybe 30 with mixed weapons–—
AK's, SKS's...

1517
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,678
a couple RPG's.

1518
01:46:33,763 --> 01:46:36,389
Scorpion's gonna need
to be redirected.

1519
01:46:36,474 --> 01:46:38,892
Mr. Wickwire, come in.

1520
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:44,314
Do you read me,
Mr. Wickwire?

1521
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,484
- I can't raise the beach. You got 'em?
- Stand by.

1522
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:50,278
Wick, you copy?
Wick.

1523
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:55,700
Negative. I'll keep eyes on you.
Fall back, Radio Chaser.

1524
01:46:55,785 --> 01:46:58,995
No, Lieutenant.
I got the better eyeball. You go back.

1525
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,914
- Chief, I think that l–—
- Lieutenant, go.

1526
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,541
Roger that.

1527
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:11,883
Wait a minute. Take cover.
Take cover and freeze.

1528
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:17,806
You got a vehicle coming towards you,
coming up the hill.

1529
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:24,145
Stand fast.
He might blow right by ya.

1530
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:31,778
[Sighs]
Nope, we're not that lucky.

1531
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,780
Stay down.

1532
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:40,787
[Engine Off]

1533
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,794
Lieutenant,
if this goes down...

1534
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:51,589
make it silent.

1535
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:55,635
Control your breathing.

1536
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:58,471
Comin' at ya.

1537
01:48:00,224 --> 01:48:02,142
Twenty-five feet.

1538
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:04,811
He's a big boy. You're gonna have
to take him from behind.

1539
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:06,813
Twenty

1540
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:11,693
Fifteen.
Movin' to your left.

1541
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:17,448
Ten feet.
Right behind ya.

1542
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:22,078
[Man Shouting
Native Language]

1543
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:24,289
[Speaking Native Language]

1544
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:31,838
He's turned around.

1545
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:34,424
- You want me to do it?
- [Jordan] Negative.

1546
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:36,509
I'll do what I have to do,
but it's my call.

1547
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,845
- [Gun Cocks]
- Here he comes.

1548
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:43,016
Eight feet. Six.

1549
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:46,811
- He's got ya. I'm taking him.
- No.

1550
01:48:47,855 --> 01:48:49,939
Fuck!

1551
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:52,525
- [Men Shouting]
- Clear out. Get back to the beach.

1552
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:54,611
Go! Go!

1553
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:02,118
[Gunshot Echoes]

1554
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:08,291
- That's the Chief.
- [Gunfire]

1555
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:14,464
[Gunfire Continues]

1556
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:20,553
Chaser, this is Chaser Alpha.
Do you read me?

1557
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:23,223
- Comm to Chaser. Do you got 'em?
- Copy that, Chaser.

1558
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:26,726
This is your lucky day, L.T.
Stand by, Chaser.

1559
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,728
Hostile activity,
this location.

1560
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:32,899
I say again, this location too hot.
[Panting]

1561
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,860
Request you advise coordinates
for new extract.

1562
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:39,072
- Over.
- O'Neil, slow down. Slow down.

1563
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:41,115
Chaser Alpha,
loud and clear.

1564
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,326
Will relay your traffic
to Las Vegas control. Over.

1565
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,704
Also request gunship support
for extraction.

1566
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:48,706
Location to follow.
Over.

1567
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:51,584
[Man On Radio] Roger that, Chaser
Alpha. Will relay priority to Las Vegas.

1568
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,671
Give me the coordinates when
you got 'em. We're outta here, guys.

1569
01:49:54,755 --> 01:49:56,756
We gotta get those boats out to sea.

1570
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,842
If we don't get those boats back
to the extract site, wherever that is...

1571
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:01,761
Scorpion's mission goes down.

1572
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:04,597
Leave one boat with my team.
I'll wait for the Chief.

1573
01:50:10,187 --> 01:50:12,272
- [Men Shouting]
- [Gunfire]

1574
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:17,068
[Gunfire Continues]

1575
01:50:17,152 --> 01:50:19,445
RPG's.
He's fucked.

1576
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:21,864
Sounds like Chief's
running a little late.

1577
01:50:21,949 --> 01:50:25,118
We gotta go. O'Neil, retrace
your tracks. Cortez, pick up the rear.

1578
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:27,912
- We're going back in there for body parts?
- You're damn right we are.

1579
01:50:27,997 --> 01:50:29,706
Do the headwork with me.

1580
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:32,542
If he's on the run, he's not coming back
this way to lead them to us.

1581
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,961
Right? Now look here.

1582
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:38,589
If we’re here,
and I left the Chief here...

1583
01:50:38,674 --> 01:50:40,591
I think he's gonna
make his way southwest...

1584
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:43,219
down this wash and out to sea.

1585
01:50:43,304 --> 01:50:46,389
If we hump it, we can get there
and knock out any pursuit.

1586
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:48,766
You work this out with the Chief
ahead of time, O'Neil...

1587
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:50,977
or are you just clairvoyant?

1588
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:53,021
No, but it's what I'd do.

1589
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:57,984
- I don't know. It sounds like a fucking crapshoot.
- Hash.

1590
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:01,279
- What's up?
- Your team, take three boats.

1591
01:51:01,363 --> 01:51:05,450
- Wait for new extraction location from Las Vegas.
- Roger that.

1592
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:08,328
The rest of us, we're gonna stay,
make sure the Chief gets out.

1593
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:31,684
[Man On Radio] This is Las Vegas.
Message to follow.

1594
01:51:31,769 --> 01:51:36,647
New extract at 0-2-6-7-5-2.

1595
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:42,779
I say again,
0-2-6-7-5-2.

1596
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:45,114
- Over.
- Copy, Las Vegas.

1597
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:50,661
But those boats will be there
this time, correct? Over.

1598
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,664
That's a roger.
Sorry for the last.

1599
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:56,376
It won't happen again.
This is Las Vegas, out.

1600
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,419
Yeah, Scorpion, out.

1601
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,256
Let's go.

1602
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:13,393
Here?

1603
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:18,898
I think it's perfect for a parallel
ambush. We can suck them right in.

1604
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:24,779
Yeah. Let's do it.

1605
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:13,911
Wickwire.
Come in, Wickwire.

1606
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,301
[Jordan]
What ya got, Cortez?

1607
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,595
Nothin'.

1608
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:33,764
O'Neil, it's Wick.

1609
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:38,102
- Can you read my mind? What do you think?
- I don't see any other way.

1610
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:41,814
There was foliage back to the south that
was good cover, but that's high ground.

1611
01:53:41,899 --> 01:53:44,484
I think he'd just be trapped.

1612
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:48,404
- [Sighs] I don't know, Wick. Shit.

01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:54,035
Well, I see the Chief, and he's got
a boatload of trouble comin' our way.

1615
01:53:55,537 --> 01:53:58,331
Boys, let's get ready
to rock and roll.

01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:11,636
Hold it, guys. Don't get trigger happy.
I got him at 30 yards.

1618
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,096
Keep comin', baby.
Keep comin'.

1619
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,307
[Panting]
Come on.

1620
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:19,060
Twenty yards. Come on, Chief. We're
suckin' 'em–— We're suckin' 'em in.

1621
01:54:20,604 --> 01:54:24,440
[Wickwire] Hold 'em up.
Hold 'em up.

1622
01:54:24,525 --> 01:54:28,110
- He's hit! He's down!
- He's hit! Gotta blow it now!

Negative, Slovnik.
He's in the kill zone.

Las Vegas, this is Chaser Alpha.
We have heavy, hostile–—

1625

Repeat, immediate extraction.

- [Groans]
- [Slovnik] He's hit again!

1627

Fire, fire!
Fire, fire! Cover him!

1628

to Las Vegas! Come in!

- She made it!

1632

Come on, come on,
come on!

1633
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:25,835
Got ya!

1635
01:55:32,009 --> 01:55:34,719
[Wickwire] Newberry, give me smoke!
Get him out of here!

1636
01:55:34,803 --> 01:55:37,555
- Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!

1637
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:40,850

Stay down!

- Push it! Push it! Push it!

01:57:11,942 --> 01:57:14,193
He's alive!
Give me some room!

1651
01:57:14,277 --> 01:57:16,696
- Slovnik, give me some room!
- [Man] All aboard!

1652
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:19,115
All bodies in!
Let's get the hell out of Dodge!

1653
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:38,884
- What a goat fuck.
- [Wickwire] How's the Chief doin'?

1654
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:41,929
He's all right.

1655
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:51,772
Hey, O'Neil! I'd go to war
with you any day.

1656
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:59,488
I'll never live this one down.

1657
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:02,199
[Man On Radio] Tango-Niner, are you
boys en route with cargo? Over.

1658
01:58:02,284 --> 01:58:04,034
[Jordan]
Sundown, this is Team Leader.

1659
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:05,745
We have the cargo safely in hand...

1660
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:07,830
and just tell whoever's listening
that we're coming home.

1661
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:09,081
Tango-Niner out.

1662
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,683
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1663
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:40,112
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1664
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:47,161
- Welcome aboard, Sergeant.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1665
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,833
Welcome aboard, sir.

1666
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,638
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

[Cheering, Clanging Continue]

1669
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:49,348
# I remember#

1670
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:53,477
# Holding on to you #

1671
01:59:58,608 --> 02:00:03,237
# All them long
and lonely nights #

1672
02:00:03,321 --> 02:00:06,198
# I've put you through #

1673
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,373
# Somewhere in there #

1674
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:19,003
[Salem] Welcome to the SEALS
C.R.T. selection program.

1675
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:24,967
You have volunteered for the most
intensive military training known to man.

1676
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:27,386
Attention!

1677
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:31,056
I now turn you over
to my Command Master Chief...

1678
02:00:31,141 --> 02:00:33,475
John James Urgayle.

1679
02:00:34,603 --> 02:00:39,273
# I recall all those nights #

1680
02:00:39,357 --> 02:00:44,403
[Chief] I never saw
a wild thing sorry for itself

1681
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:47,990
A bird will fall
frozen dead from a bough...

1682
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:55,497
without ever having
felt sorry for itself.

1683
02:00:55,582 --> 02:00:57,666
[Pyro] Boat crews,
stand by your boats!

1684
02:00:57,751 --> 02:01:01,420
- Move your asses!
- [Men Shouting]

1685
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:05,549
# Was I just off somewhere #

1686
02:01:05,634 --> 02:01:08,719
#Just to hide #

1687
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:17,227
# But I can't remember#

1688
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:21,690
# If we said good-bye #

1689
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:57,643
# I only miss you here #

1690
02:01:57,727 --> 02:02:01,230
# Every now and then #

1691
02:02:05,443 --> 02:02:10,906
# Like the soft breeze
blowing on #

1692
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:14,493
# Through my curtains #

1693
02:02:19,082 --> 02:02:22,960
# Each November#

1694
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:26,380
# I break down and cry #

1695
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:35,139
# But I can't remember#

1696
02:02:35,223 --> 02:02:38,809
# If we said good-bye #

1697
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:47,526
# I can't remember#

1698
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:52,448
# If we said good-bye #

1699
02:02:52,532 --> 02:02:55,451
# Ohhh #

1700
02:02:55,535 --> 02:02:59,705
# I can't remember#

1701
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:03,959
# If we said good-bye #

1702
02:03:08,256 --> 02:03:10,966
# Good-bye ##

1703
02:03:11,051 --> 02:03:16,221
# The future is a war#

1704
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,351
# Out the window went
the perfect past #

1705
02:03:21,436 --> 02:03:23,062
# A participle, particle
An atom to smash #

1706
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:27,274
# And smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again #

1707
02:03:27,358 --> 02:03:29,109
# Didn't we used to
know ourselves when #

1708
02:03:29,194 --> 02:03:30,903
# Didn't we ever
used to be friends #

1709
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:34,823
# Before a billion years
went down the drain and that's why #

1710
02:03:38,036 --> 02:03:43,832
# The future is a war#

1711
02:03:46,544 --> 02:03:48,253
# Losin' already
Losin' everything #

1712
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:50,422
# We got swastikas
hidden in magazines #

1713
02:03:50,507 --> 02:03:57,930
# Sewed in the label
of your slave-labor clothes #

1714
02:03:58,014 --> 02:03:59,932
# And that's why #

1715
02:04:02,894 --> 02:04:08,774
# The future is a war#

1716
02:04:11,528 --> 02:04:13,237
# Men prove worthy of our fears #

1717
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:15,114
# Their strength diminishes
more every year#

1718
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:17,199
# As they side with the enemy
and throw down their spears #

1719
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:20,786
# Leaving women and children
alone right here to face #

1720
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,996
# The future #

1721
02:04:23,081 --> 02:04:25,040
# That's why #

1722
02:04:28,044 --> 02:04:48,230
# The future is a war#
