1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:11,720
The universe in its vastness,

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,514
is forever changing.

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,018
The Zu mountain ranges in Sichuan, China,

4
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,728
are famous for their lofty crags

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,730
and jagged peaks.

6
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:26,985
It is said that elves and spirits live here.

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,781
There are many legends in these parts.

8
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,117
One of these are about immortals

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,996
possessing supernatural powers.

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,999
They fly on their swords, chase the wind

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,001
and the stars.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,128
They tune their minds and bodies

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,799
in search of the eternal truths of the universe,

14
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,760
so that Man and Nature can be one.

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,974
Remember, Omei students,

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,602
never succumb to greed and jealousy.

17
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,397
That's the beginning of all evil.

18
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,774
During my recent training,

19
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,778
I could feel a strong force working against us.

20
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,990
I could hear cries of horror which filled me

21
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,616
with a sense of foreboding.

22
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,327
The evil forces could be

23
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,331
attempting another assault

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,751
Omei being the leading school in these mountains,

25
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,087
we must be prepared

26
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,381
for a surprise attack.

27
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,801
We safeguard peace and order in the Zu mountains.

28
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:15,153
Look at the aura over Omei.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,573
They have a great following,

30
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,284
unlike us,

31
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,203
there's only you and me here.

32
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:28,166
The tradition in Kun Lun is based on yin and yang.

33
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,043
The sun and moon represent Kun Lun,

34
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,838
hence there's only been one teacher one student.

35
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,341
King Sky, how long have you studied with me?

36
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,843
200 years.

37
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:42,848
200 years... How time flies.

38
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,058
Yet I haven't been able to change.

39
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,019
I still miss my teacher

40
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,271
after all these years.

41
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,982
I'm still affected by emotions,

42
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,235
that's why my training cannot progress.

43
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,489
I don't want you to end up like me.

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,366
You have to leave me.

45
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,005
This is my weapon the Moon Orb.

46
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,008
Don't come back until you've mastered it.

47
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,885
If I'm not here when you come back,

48
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,971
the Moon Orb will find me.

49
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,641
It'll bring you to me.

50
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,529
The Sun and Moon Orbs

51
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,531
are the protectors of Kun Lun

52
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,573
If the evil force invades...

53
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,784
what will you do?

54
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,455
My destiny depends on your success.
Go now!

55
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,084
I'll worry about that when it happens.

56
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,472
500 years ago,
Insomnia destroyed the Wah Shan Clan

57
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,601
300 years after that, the Kun Lun.

58
00:07:55,767 --> 00:08:00,522
And now, he's targeting Omei.

59
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,840
The battle between good and evil is eternal.

60
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,885
But Insomnia is moving sooner than we expected

61
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,096
We must evacuate all innocent humans nearby.

62
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,391
Right now, two armies are at war nearby.

63
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,186
Insomnia means business,

64
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,522
there will be a major conflict

65
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,899
Go and evacuate the armies now,

66
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,151
get them as far away from here as possible.

67
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,987
Yes, sir, at once.

68
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,752
I'll be back as soon as I can.

69
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,619
Red, it's been a long time.

70
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:42,124
King Sky, you've beaten me to it.

71
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,459
In your clan,

72
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,460
everything must go through the system

73
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,422
One can never act without instructions.

74
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,382
Frankly, I'm surprised you're here at all.

75
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,092
If Insomnia hadn't

76
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,094
destroyed Kun Lun 200 years ago,

77
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,556
you'd probably be in the same position.

78
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,435
Anyway, a war is inevitable.

79
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,812
How would you judge Insomnia's strength?

80
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,231
Omei is the last line of defense.

81
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,943
As Insomnia has made a move, he can't be bluffing.

82
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,405
From what I've seen on my way here,

83
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,241
he is many times more powerful than before.

84
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,995
In that case, we must evacuate those troops first.

85
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:39,973
The path ahead has suddenly changed into a cliff.

86
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,228
There were ghostly cries coming from 3 miles away.

87
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,481
This is just a ploy. They won't scare us off.

88
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,150
We must forge ahead at all costs!

89
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,568
Yes, sir!

90
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,819
Pioneers!

91
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,321
Sir!

92
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,948
Captain Lo and Captain Tai.

93
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,115
Sir!

94
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,952
Go with my daughter as the advance party.

95
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:00,869
Sir!

96
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,288
Hurry up, we're moving out!

97
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,532
You saw what happened.

98
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,867
This is beyond your powers.

99
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,493
Remove your heavy armour,

100
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,662
and get as far away from here as you can.

101
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,498
We're soldiers. We're scared of nothing!

102
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,667
Just who do you think you are! Arrest them!

103
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,626
Execute them!

104
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,044
Sir!

105
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,629
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

106
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:53,881
Do you know who that is?

107
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,301
That's Insomnia, an extremely powerful force!

108
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,927
There's no time to argue.

109
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,470
This evil monster is very close now,

110
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,891
by the time you see him you'll all be dead!

111
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,478
You've shown up at last.

112
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,213
You two are nothing!

113
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,215
I'm not interested in fighting with you.

114
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,759
So this is what you look like.

115
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,145
Go on, fight!

116
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,356
You'll never conquer your own demons.

117
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:01,527
Anyway, you just don't have what it takes,

118
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,737
and nobody can help you with that.

119
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,932
Whitebrows! You're a hypocrite

120
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,727
sending two beginners as cannon fodder.

121
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,729
Your disciples don't know the true face

122
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,523
that's hidden behind that facade of righteousness!

123
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,464
Heaven and Thunder Swords,

124
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,466
7 Saints and 300 Castles

125
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,510
will follow me to fight evil at Conch Valley!

126
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,136
Sir!

127
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,208
The Sky Reflector points to this spot,

128
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,335
Insomnia must be nearby.

129
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,505
Heaven Strikes!

130
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,807
Thunder Fires!

131
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,003
It's big brother!

132
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,263
Grand Master!

133
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,641
Grand Master!

134
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,900
Who's that?

135
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,361
A friend from Kun Lun, I think.

136
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,117
Insomnia's over there!

137
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,202
He's up there!

138
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,630
He's trying to suck you in!

139
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,197
What's in there?

140
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,533
Its power overcame both Heaven and Thunder swords

141
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,244
They were almost sucked in.

142
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,289
I believe this must be the Blood Cave

143
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,416
that many great masters have searched for.

144
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,419
I now realize what Insomnia is up to.

145
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,962
He's used our power

146
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,923
to open the Blood Cave.

147
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,676
If he's able to obtain the power within,

148
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:08,055
none of us would be his match.

149
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,390
We were wrong about Insomnia,

150
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,685
he didn't start an early attack on Omei,

151
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,855
it's only starting now.

152
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,316
Let me go in and kill him!

153
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,818
I'll go!

154
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,822
No. Your two swords are the guardians of Omei,

155
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,576
if you're trapped in there, Omei will be finished.

156
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,246
The 7 of us can go!

157
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,081
If something does happen to us

158
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,666
it won't put your plans in jeopardy.

159
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,037
We knew once we're in here,

160
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,331
it won't be easy to get out.

161
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,958
I suggest we split up.

162
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,877
Whoever finds Insomnia waits here.

163
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,045
We're not leaving here until we find him.

164
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,257
If one of us is possessed by the demon,

165
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,259
we must agree that the other will not hesitate.

166
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,345
He must kill him!

167
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,808
Don't worry, I agree.

168
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,395
Though very old friends are we.

169
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,480
Still we must part.

170
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,686
Keep watch outside the cave.

171
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,313
No matter what happens in there,

172
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,314
don't use weapons.

173
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,233
Just wait here, I'll try to rescue them.

174
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,944
Remember, conserve your power!

175
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,831
The Sky Reflector!

176
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:07,109
Red! King Sky!

177
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,963
The Sky Reflector...

178
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,133
It's been sucked away! What now?

179
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:38,265
The cave is closing up! Get out of here!

180
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,952
It's like a maze inside the cave,

181
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,913
how far in do you think it goes?

182
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,041
Since he's gone in there, it probably stretches

183
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,752
all the way to the base of the Zu mountains.

184
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,046
We don't have much time, let's split up.

185
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,088
Red!

186
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,757
Yes, sir.

187
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,551
You have experience of the power in the cave,

188
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,220
and you've had more training than others,

189
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,763
so I want you to guard the entrance.

190
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,017
If you see anything, inform Omei at once.

191
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,810
If anyone or anything tries to come out, kill it!

192
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,229
I'm the head student in Omei,

193
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,898
I'll take up the first line of defense!

194
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,859
King Sky, though you're not from Omei,

195
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:34,321
this is the survival of everyone on the mountains.

196
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,865
Please inform Point Nirvana and all other clans,

197
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,159
tell them to guard their own energy force

198
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:40,911
to make sure it doesn't dissipate.

199
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,246
It's my duty to destroy this monster!

200
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,248
I'll go now.

201
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,334
I didn't think we'd get out alive.

202
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,920
I hope we'll be able to work together again.

203
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,463
We are.

204
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:54,299
We just split up as we did before.

205
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,136
Come back soon, we need you!

206
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,347
Heaven and Thunder, 7 Saints and others

207
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,348
follow me.

208
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,058
We need to prepare for Insomnia

209
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,059
when he re-emerges.

210
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,603
Yes!

211
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:53,984
Big brother, take care.

212
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,360
Take care.

213
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,989
King Sky has strong feelings towards you.

214
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:02,075
I've known him for 200 years,

215
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:05,746
I know there's only one woman for him,

216
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:08,248
that's his teacher.

217
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,084
But if he has feelings for you,

218
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,086
that means he's changed.

219
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:15,005
The feelings were only fleeting.

220
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,466
I'm not surprised he could change after 200 years,

221
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,093
but we're going to train for thousands of years,

222
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,304
so what does that matter?

223
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,183
Enigma, we're going!

224
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,586
Though the 9 magic flowers in Omei

225
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,588
did not all blossom

226
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:23,550
The energy here is still very strong.

227
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:28,430
As soon as your man informed us of the danger,

228
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,432
I immediately had the whole place

229
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,353
protected by sacred scriptures.

230
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:38,524
Yet that didn't stop the energy draining away.

231
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,986
It looks like the Blood Cave has begun drawing

232
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,197
our energy through the bottom of the mountain.

233
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:50,744
I'm worried that even my Golden Dragon Seal

234
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,789
may not be able to avert a disaster.

235
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:01,004
The magic flowers are withering!

236
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,966
Omei's energy is dissipating!

237
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:07,803
Our powers will also wither with the flowers.

238
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,888
Good forces are waning,

239
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,889
evil forces are on the rise

240
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:14,852
To ensure we can defeat Insomnia,

241
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,436
we'll need other weapons

242
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,356
to complement the Heaven and Thunder Swords.

243
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,818
Are Heaven and Thunder powerful enough

244
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:25,028
to take care of Insomnia?

245
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:29,032
They need to merge to release their ultimate power

246
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:31,910
Unfortunately they haven't managed that so far.

247
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,080
We must achieve that

248
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,207
before the 8 flowers wither.

249
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,469
Heaven and Thunder are male and female.
They can complement or

250
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,471
be detrimental to each other

251
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,308
The two minds must work as one during the merge.

252
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,143
Even the slightest mistake

253
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:59,813
can kill you both, in body and spirit.

254
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,616
You and I must think as one.

255
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,660
After 1,000 years, 2,000 years...

256
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,538
will we still be able to think as one?

257
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,430
Hollow, look out!

258
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,035
Who's there?

259
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:29,046
Yes, she's your teacher Dawn of 200 years ago.

260
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:38,847
I must enter another dimension to find

261
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:12,756
I've been chief of Omei for 2,000 years,

262
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:14,883
during which time

263
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:15,884
our clan has grown and prospered.

264
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:18,428
Now I must go into meditation

265
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,429
for the coming battle

266
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:23,100
As Red has to guard the Blood Cave,

267
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:26,562
King Sky will take over as chief of Omei.

268
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:29,314
All Omei students must abide

269
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,316
by King Sky's orders.

270
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:33,819
That is my order.

271
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,419
I must get him to teach me!

272
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,758
I must get him to teach me...

273
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,764
I must get him to teach me...

274
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:10,856
I must get him to teach me...

275
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:18,322
No one in Omei can use the Thunder Sword anymore.

276
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,698
The only hope

277
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:22,451
lies in Hollow's spirit in the sword.

278
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,995
I can use that to create another man

279
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,414
but he will no longer be Hollow.

280
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:30,083
How much of Hollow's power survives

281
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,127
will depend on fate.

282
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:27,391
You're pretty, but a demon's still a demon!

283
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,035
Killing you is like squashing an ant!

284
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,125
You're nothing. I'd only soil my hands.

285
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,428
Guard the entrance.

286
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,722
If you see anything, inform Omei at once.

287
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:09,683
If anyone or anything tries to come out, kill it!

288
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,564
If the merge of Heaven and Thunder

289
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,983
is not enough to deal with this disaster,

290
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,570
Then we'll need the 3 elements to merge.

291
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,572
What's that?

292
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,950
To have 3 forces combine as one.

293
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,745
They are: Power of the mind,

294
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:32,581
power of the universe and power of regeneration

295
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:33,749
When I'm gone,

296
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,668
The Ming Fire I leave behind will be the mind

297
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:40,255
The weapon in the other dimension is the universe

298
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:43,592
as for the power of regeneration...

299
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:45,552
Where is that?

300
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,596
That power is within you.

301
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:51,016
To merge the 3 you must first perceive this power.

302
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,560
People will worry if they know I've left my body

303
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,020
so you mustn't tell anyone.

304
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:57,898
What if something happens, how do I find you?

305
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,691
You can't.

306
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,069
Just do what you think is right,

307
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:05,697
and rely on the Ming Fire, the power of my mind.

308
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,285
The fire lives, I live.

309
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,919
If I find the power of the universe,

310
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,255
you'll see a signal in the sky.

311
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,507
At that time we can launch a full counter-attack.

312
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,175
What if the men want to find you?

313
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,637
The Ming Fire will transmit my image to them.

314
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,265
Our survival depends on

315
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,308
The merge of the 3 elements

316
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,143
I must go now.

317
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,604
Good will triumph over evil!

318
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:52,744
Good will triumph over evil.

319
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,752
Grand Master,

320
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,754
I can feel the energy waning in Omei.

321
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,674
Has something happened in Omei?

322
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:11,263
Red, you must have faith in me. I told you...

323
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,015
I have everything under control.

324
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,808
His time has not yet come,

325
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,894
Insomnia won't be able to use his magic

326
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,687
So don't worry,

327
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:20,772
just guard the cave

328
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,274
and don't let him out.

329
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:24,276
If anything happens, let me know.

330
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,279
Anyway, you must be strong.

331
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,115
You must never waiver.

332
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:33,660
Anyway...

333
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,412
just await my good news.

334
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:19,831
Hollow!

335
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,333
He's not Hollow.

336
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,961
Whitebrows has given him a new name Ying.

337
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,295
He needs to relearn everything.

338
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:26,338
You know him well,

339
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,549
it's best you be his teacher.

340
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,801
Ridiculous! Anyone who wants to study in Omei

341
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:33,220
must first find his own sword.

342
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:36,723
Only then will he become one of us!

343
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:44,565
Hollow! I'm Enigma,

344
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:48,193
we practiced the double sword together, remember?

345
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:52,906
Hollow!

346
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,411
Hollow!

347
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:06,962
Hollow!

348
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,964
I'm going to be your teacher, understand?

349
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:10,924
He has no recollection of the past.

350
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:14,428
To restore his memory, you have to open his mind.

351
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:17,306
Once he remembers, his powers will return.

352
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:19,641
Emotions can be a major obstacle.

353
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:22,311
Don't let the past inhibit you from teaching him.

354
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:28,483
You can be my student for now. I'll wait.

355
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:44,750
Why're you still here?

356
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,963
You can't fly without your wings?

357
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,846
You're useless, what's all your training for?

358
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,523
I'll help you.

359
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:24,039
Now you have your wings back, fly away!

360
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,461
Though I have wings I can't fly away.

361
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,305
I can give you freedom, I can also take your life!

362
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,558
So behave!

363
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,226
I could kill you with my little finger!

364
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,792
This is my sword!

365
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:11,378
I've found my sword!

366
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:14,256
I can speak!

367
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:19,386
I can speak clearly! Can you hear me?

368
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:13,148
Can I be your student?

369
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:15,442
Student?

370
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,028
I can teach you many things

371
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,280
but I don't believe in this master

372
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:22,282
and student nonsense.

373
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:23,825
So will you teach me?

374
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:24,701
Let's start!

375
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,754
When will I be able to fly like them?

376
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,299
Fly!

377
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,886
Fly!

378
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,422
You're so ugly,

379
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:22,426
and you... can't... even... fly!

380
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,344
Forget it!

381
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,348
Think of the past, it may help you to remember.

382
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:31,810
Think? How can I with a sword like this?

383
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,353
You're the teacher you should know!

384
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,106
Maybe I should be your teacher? Think about that!

385
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:40,277
How can I make you learn?

386
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,451
Stop pushing me! You've taught me nothing!

387
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:48,952
Just what do you want from me?

388
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,705
Teach me if you want but don't tie me up!

389
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:54,041
You were a good fighter.

390
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,920
You and your sword were the guardians of Omei.

391
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,714
You can keep this scrap iron, give me yours!

392
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:04,051
Find yourself another teacher!

393
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:05,802
I will!

394
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,763
I'll be the teacher!

395
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,182
I'll open your mind!

396
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,768
I'll open your stupid mind!

397
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,770
I'll open your damn stupid mind!

398
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,850
Why're you fighting me?

399
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,019
Don't you want to be with me anymore?

400
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:41,148
Do you want to go back to Omei?

401
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,775
If you go back we'll be separated.

402
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:45,986
Don't you want me anymore?

403
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:56,747
Merge of the 3 elements?

404
00:49:56,914 --> 00:50:00,292
To have 3 forces combine as one.

405
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:03,337
They are: Power of the mind,

406
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:06,215
power of the universe and power of regeneration.

407
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,675
Where's the power of regeneration?

408
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,180
That power is within you

409
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:16,475
To merge the 3 you must first perceive this power.

410
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:27,212
All those who have been recreated

411
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:29,631
leave something of their past

412
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:30,632
in the Tri-Element Hall

413
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:36,805
Look, that's my teacher.

414
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,474
Your thoughts are really bothering me.

415
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,560
Just tell me what you want.

416
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:45,731
You get that feeling
from my teacher's Moon Orb.

417
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,984
When the merge failed, you fell into the water.

418
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,820
The Moon Orb got rid of the fire on you.

419
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:55,324
My teacher said the Moon Orb would take me to her.

420
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,952
What Moon Orb? I'm not your teacher!

421
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,466
All weapons have their own spirit.

422
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,760
The Moon Orb was yours.

423
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:16,136
You may have changed,

424
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:17,804
but it can still recognize you

425
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,683
Take me for example,

426
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:25,395
I've tried but the Thunder Sword always evades me.

427
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,108
Heaven and Thunder have their own masters,

428
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,777
They won't go with anyone else.

429
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:33,946
Unless you erase their memory

430
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:34,947
in the Tri-Element Hall

431
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:37,533
you won't become its new master.

432
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,842
I've used the Heaven Sword to summon Thunder.

433
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:57,094
You must decide...

434
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,222
whether you want to go in.

435
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,685
I'm the only clue to your past.

436
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,603
If I go in,

437
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,692
Dawn will disappear forever from this world.

438
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:15,028
And you'll never know about the past.

439
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,782
You'll never be Dawn again.

440
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,522
Master Whitebrows!

441
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,399
Master!

442
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:20,237
He's not here!

443
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,281
No wonder we haven't seen him.

444
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:41,216
Moon Orb...

445
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,429
Using it,
I can get rid of the heat in your body.

446
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:49,683
How can I get my Moon Orb back?

447
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:52,394
Tell me!

448
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:55,814
Tell me how I can become your teacher again!

449
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,029
What can I do to save you?

450
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:21,215
Give me back the Moon Orb!

451
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,595
Give me back the Moon Orb!

452
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:32,976
Give it back! I want to be your teacher again!

453
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,062
I suggest we reform Omei.

454
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:19,064
We can't go on without a chief.

455
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:20,858
I'm going to find brother Red,

456
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:24,069
and sister Enigma.

457
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:25,571
All of us together,

458
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,573
can ensure Omei's survival.

459
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:31,326
We'll fight to the end,

460
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,413
to the very last man!

461
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,623
For justice and for the Zu mountains!

462
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:39,418
Even if we lose,

463
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:43,714
we won't have failed our ancestors!

464
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:48,969
I'm going to find Red now.

465
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:54,892
Red!

466
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,607
It's evil magic! Get back!

467
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,522
It's very strong!

468
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:06,213
We can't hold out much longer.

469
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:28,944
Take shelter with other schools!

470
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,372
What's that? What's going on up there?

471
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,002
The magic's gone?

472
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:47,504
People up there have lost their powers?

473
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:49,423
I wonder if they know I'm...

474
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,258
What, more?!

475
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,056
They're too strong, we can't hold them back.

476
00:59:58,223 --> 00:59:59,808
Take my sword!

477
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,144
From now on, it's yours!

478
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,937
It'll take you down the mountain.

479
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:05,981
Go!

480
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:36,989
Big brother

481
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,126
I've... got you!

482
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:51,170
I've got you!

483
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:54,506
I've got the Heaven Sword!

484
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:56,008
I've destroyed Omei!

485
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:59,219
Insomnia, you always say I'm a loser,

486
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,431
but now I've conquered Omei and the Zu mountains,

487
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:04,725
yet you're instill inside that Blood Cave!

488
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:08,228
Phantom troopers, take her body away!

489
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:18,655
Red, spare no-one!

490
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:20,616
Raze the Golden Top

491
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:22,993
to the ground!

492
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:53,375
Where're you going with that sword?

493
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:58,422
Omei's finished, it's just a pile of rubble now.

494
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,174
What is this ghastly place?

495
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:03,927
Winner takes all, that's always how it is.

496
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:05,179
I'm a soldier,

497
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:07,639
I'll never allow myself be beaten!

498
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:10,017
I'm going back to kill the enemy!

499
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:12,519
Anyone trying to stop me is my enemy too!

500
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:14,146
Enemy?

501
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:16,064
You're just a rusty old sword,

502
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,482
you make me sick!

503
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:07,783
You're still not enlightened?

504
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:09,576
Not you too!

505
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,787
Our strength has been nullified.

506
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:12,913
It'd be too late

507
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,332
even if you became enlightened

508
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:16,959
I wish I had inherited the Thunder Sword.

509
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:19,503
Let's go.

510
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:20,796
Right!

511
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:24,466
If you're waiting for me to become enlightened,

512
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:26,093
what have you all been doing?

513
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,595
We've been waiting for you!

514
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:31,515
Thunder Sword!

515
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,517
Thunder Sword!

516
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:34,852
Thunder Sword!

517
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:38,313
Thunder Sword!

518
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:55,414
Many students have lost their lives because of it!

519
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:56,748
Give it to me.

520
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,918
Give it to me!

521
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:01,753
I'll destroy it!

522
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,213
Give it here!

523
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:05,507
What? Are you scared you'd lose it?

524
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:08,427
It won't remember, eh?

525
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,387
I'll help it remember!

526
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:32,409
It may no longer be a rusty sword,

527
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:35,579
but it's still not much use.

528
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:36,997
If it had fought back sooner,

529
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,333
it may have helped.

530
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,418
Now it's too late.

531
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:44,963
You're on your own.

532
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:53,096
Can I go with you?

533
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,723
Fly!

534
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:04,233
Fly!

535
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:07,402
This is high enough!

536
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:22,936
It's the fire left by Grand Master.

537
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,938
Grand Master!

538
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,282
Grand Master!

539
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,125
Grand Master!

540
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:46,460
We've failed to protect Omei

541
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:49,630
the school's been destroyed.

542
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:52,758
Now there's only us left...

543
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,597
Ying! You've extinguished Grand Master's fire!

544
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:01,391
Kneel! You must apologize!

545
01:09:02,226 --> 01:09:03,894
No! An apology's not good enough!

546
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:04,770
Thrown him out!

547
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:06,897
But he has the Thunder Sword.

548
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:08,190
It's just a sword!

549
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,193
You scoundrel! Bring Grand Master back!

550
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,904
Bring him back!

551
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,031
See the blue light in the sky?

552
01:09:58,198 --> 01:09:59,783
That's a signal from Whitebrows.

553
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:01,869
He must have found what he wanted.

554
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,042
That's it! Let's get it!

555
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:39,907
Omei's survival depends on the 3 elements:

556
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:43,160
The power of the mind,

557
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:45,621
power of the universe and power of regeneration.

558
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:48,624
The power of regeneration is within you.

559
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:53,795
To have 3 forces combine as one.

560
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:58,634
Merge the 3 elements.

561
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,462
I've received the Ming Fire signal

562
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:36,755
from Whitebrows.

563
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:39,299
It's time to launch a counter-attack.

564
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:40,676
But they've captured Enigma.

565
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:43,929
We must rescue her before we attack.

566
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:47,808
Your spirits will have to leave your bodies

567
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:50,227
to enter the Blood Cave.

568
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:52,896
Insomnia will try everything he can

569
01:11:53,105 --> 01:11:56,275
to find your physical beings and destroy them,

570
01:11:56,483 --> 01:12:00,237
so your spirits will have no bodies to return to.

571
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:04,491
I suggest you leave your bodies on Point Nirvana.

572
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:07,744
Even if Insomnia finds them,

573
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:10,789
we'll be able to hold him off for some time.

574
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:20,007
The school lives, we live...

575
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,518
Look at you, so high up!

576
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:33,812
You have the whole world at your feet!

577
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:35,439
Good, eh?

578
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:38,108
Look, you're all shining in gold!

579
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:41,987
Soon the Blood River will

580
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:42,988
be looming high above Zu!

581
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,616
Insomnia, come out now.

582
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,619
Today is your big day!

583
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,271
Your sword easily broke

584
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:17,314
through the enemy's defense

585
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:19,233
How does it feel to be victorious?

586
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:21,944
You'll soon get used to it.

587
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,279
I'll be with you, you won't be lonely.

588
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:44,758
Insomnia!

589
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:45,801
What?

590
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,678
That's the Blood Clouds! Take cover!

591
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:49,304
Over to the canyon!

592
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:06,113
The Blood Clouds
have totally covered Green Castle.

593
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:09,283
Concentrate our powers on the Blood Cave,

594
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:11,076
we must rescue Enigma first!

595
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:26,091
The Blood Clouds have reached the Zu mountains,

596
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:28,051
my friends are all there.

597
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:31,221
You want to go back and help them?

598
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,144
In fighting the enemy,

599
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:38,812
you wouldn't abandon your men

600
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:40,981
on the battlefield, would you?

601
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:43,734
I understand. You go.

602
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,278
If you lose this war,

603
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:48,864
it'll be disastrous for us too.

604
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:52,034
Take care!

605
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,841
There's a power of justice in the world.

606
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:10,344
I encountered it once,

607
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:13,889
unfortunately I didn't treasure it.

608
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:15,724
If I could,

609
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:18,101
I'd like to rediscover that power.

610
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:48,048
At last, a chance to show my potential!

611
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,930
Here we meet again.

612
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:56,640
But you're no longer Red.

613
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:58,767
You're just a watch dog at Blood Cave!

614
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:02,479
Never mind the past!

615
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:04,982
I guess being the chief has made you humorless.

616
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:06,942
All that bureaucracy, eh?

617
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:10,988
Right now, I feel very differently to you.

618
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:15,117
Your heart is heavy,

619
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:16,410
but

620
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,495
I'm exhilarated.

621
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:22,541
I now realize what power means!

622
01:16:23,876 --> 01:16:27,588
My power is constantly increasing.

623
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:30,090
And you,

624
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:32,843
you're like a mosquito to me,

625
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:36,889
if I speak a little louder I might blow you away

626
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:38,932
Enigma's down there.

627
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:40,893
What are you looking for?

628
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:42,853
Are you looking for her?

629
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:52,321
I'll levitate her, so you can have a better look.

630
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,668
That's just her physical being, her spirit...

631
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:09,588
is right here!

632
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:10,714
Nonsense!

633
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:12,549
If someone else's spirit is in you,

634
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:13,550
where is your own?

635
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:18,972
You want to know? Come in and find out!

636
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:20,807
Red!

637
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:44,373
Enigma!

638
01:18:02,224 --> 01:18:03,392
Thunder Sword!

639
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:06,061
No! The Blood Cave will suck your sword away!

640
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:23,412
It's got my sword!

641
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:47,769
Get your spirit inside Enigma's body

642
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:48,770
and rescue her

643
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:50,314
Good idea!

644
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:04,661
Stop bluffing, King Sky.

645
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,330
You won't kill me,

646
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:09,166
because I have Enigma's spirit inside me!

647
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:11,960
You don't have to remind me!

648
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,086
I won't kill you,

649
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:15,172
it's the witch inside you I want!

650
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,482
Ying, look after Enigma's spirit.

651
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:54,586
King Sky!

652
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,370
Teacher!

653
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:34,626
King Sky!

654
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,297
My destiny depends on your success.

655
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:39,715
Don't hesitate.

656
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:41,800
Go now!

657
01:20:42,593 --> 01:20:44,678
My destiny depends on your success.

658
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:47,097
Don't hesitate. Go now!

659
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:50,934
Let's go!

660
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:58,692
Teacher...

661
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:03,363
I'll worry about that when it happens.

662
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:05,490
I'll worry about that

663
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,034
when it happens.

664
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:10,329
We'll wait for you back at the school!

665
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:21,632
Teacher, finally I'm enlightened!

666
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:26,094
So, are you Ying, or are you Hollow?

667
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:28,013
You'd better call me Ying.

668
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,516
You can't use Heaven Sword in your present state.

669
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:33,685
We have to do it, we have to merge.

670
01:21:34,269 --> 01:21:36,313
Right. Let's go back to Point Nirvana

671
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,315
to where my physical being is.

672
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,326
Recognize this? It's the Sky Reflector.

673
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:53,789
The most powerful weapon in Omei.

674
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:56,375
Let's see what you can do!

675
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:02,589
The Blood Clouds!

676
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:07,928
We must prepare to merge soon!

677
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:22,609
The school lives, we live...

678
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:29,783
The Buddha's Hands!

679
01:22:56,768 --> 01:22:58,729
You bald ignoramuses!

680
01:22:58,896 --> 01:23:00,564
Open your eyes,

681
01:23:00,731 --> 01:23:02,733
this is what true power is.

682
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,027
The power is all mine!

683
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:08,030
Give me King Sky's body!

684
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,315
Look, your bodies!

685
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:17,492
Want to swallow me?

686
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,590
Quickly, we must help King Sky.

687
01:25:31,757 --> 01:25:35,844
If his body is destroyed, he'll vanish forever.

688
01:25:42,559 --> 01:25:46,021
King Sky, we've found your physical body.

689
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,357
Feeling bad, are you?

690
01:25:48,607 --> 01:25:51,693
Because your body is now inside
Insomnia's stomach.

691
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,821
Soon you'll become his 10,000th spirit.

692
01:25:55,405 --> 01:26:00,327
You'll be his slave forever!

693
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:03,747
Still you'll achieve one thing,

694
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:06,291
and that is, to live the rest of your life here!

695
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:25,143
You can't outwit me.

696
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:29,314
You're not even close.

697
01:26:29,815 --> 01:26:31,775
I lured you up to the Blood Cave,

698
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,861
so I could draw away your energy

699
01:26:34,027 --> 01:26:36,613
every time you hit me.

700
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:43,287
I've drawn off all the energy from your Ming Fire.

701
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:45,956
Try it if you don't believe me.

702
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:51,587
I'll give you what you want.

703
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:57,467
I'll stay here and die with you!

704
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,558
Master Transcendental...

705
01:27:06,977 --> 01:27:10,272
We can't get out, we've been surrounded!

706
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:11,773
It's Insomnia's spirit!

707
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:13,734
Thunder, take the master and go now!

708
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,112
Be careful!

709
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:23,327
Teacher, what now?

710
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:25,370
We must merge.

711
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:27,247
You must not hesitate

712
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:28,916
like Hollow did.

713
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:32,169
I won't this time! Let's merge now!

714
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:41,595
Heaven Strikes!

715
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:44,014
Thunder Fires!

716
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:54,107
Heaven and Thunder Swords represent yin and yang.

717
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:57,653
Yin and yang complement each other.

718
01:27:58,654 --> 01:28:01,990
A swordsman must flow with the power

719
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:03,659
of his sword

720
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:06,119
and join as one.

721
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:19,758
Hesitancy and stubbornness

722
01:28:19,925 --> 01:28:22,094
restricts the flow.

723
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:25,180
Thus, one will lose oneself,

724
01:28:25,681 --> 01:28:29,309
and the merge will fail.

725
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:40,028
If I'm not here when you come back,

726
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:43,198
t he Moon Orb will find me.

727
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:21,862
Where are they?

728
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:24,406
They must have reached the speed of light

729
01:29:24,573 --> 01:29:26,950
so we can't see them.

730
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:36,668
Over there!

731
01:29:58,232 --> 01:29:59,816
The Blood Clouds

732
01:30:00,025 --> 01:30:02,319
consist of 9,999 of my spirits.

733
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:05,322
I can be reborn with each spirit.

734
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:06,990
If you want to kill me

735
01:30:07,157 --> 01:30:09,243
you have to kill me 9,999 times.

736
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:12,454
But I'd only need to kill you once,

737
01:30:12,663 --> 01:30:14,289
and you'll be gone forever!

738
01:30:14,665 --> 01:30:16,458
9,999 times?

739
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:19,670
Even if there are 100,000, we'll kill them all!

740
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:56,999
Red!

741
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:00,460
Amnesia! You won't get away!

742
01:31:01,336 --> 01:31:03,172
You must destroy me along with her.

743
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:04,673
If not,

744
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,967
she'll repossess my spirit!

745
01:31:07,593 --> 01:31:09,511
Remember our agreement?

746
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:12,181
If one of us is possessed by evil,

747
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:15,017
The other must not hesitate.

748
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:16,560
Kill me!

749
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:18,103
Kill you?

750
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:20,772
Why can't we join forces to fight that monster?

751
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,609
My physical being is not here,

752
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:26,028
it's in the Blood Cave.

753
01:31:26,612 --> 01:31:29,615
My spirit is too weak to fly back.

754
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:32,784
Even if you don't kill me, I'll vanish.

755
01:31:34,578 --> 01:31:35,913
There's still time,

756
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,915
to go back and find your body.

757
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:41,210
Though very old friends are we,

758
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:42,252
still we must part.

759
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:43,754
Kill me!

760
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:46,215
Good will triumph over evil.

761
01:31:47,799 --> 01:31:48,842
Kill me!

762
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:51,470
Die!

763
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:55,224
Red! Help me!

764
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,253
Merge again!

765
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:25,963
His spirit is inside the Blood Clouds!

766
01:32:26,672 --> 01:32:28,048
Separate them!

767
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:29,341
Right!

768
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:32,427
Without the Clouds, his spirit will be useless!

769
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:54,533
Separate him from the clouds!

770
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,250
Wait! King Sky is in his mouth!

771
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:05,669
It's too close! Split up!

772
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,140
It's the Ming Fire Sword!

773
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:06,146
I am inside your body,

774
01:34:06,188 --> 01:34:08,190
Insomnia, see where you can run now!

775
01:34:48,897 --> 01:34:50,899
I've got Dawn's feelings back!

776
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:54,278
King Sky, I've found you at last.

777
01:36:06,517 --> 01:36:10,187
After Heaven and Thunder failed in their merge,

778
01:36:10,354 --> 01:36:12,356
Whitebrows used the sword's spirit

779
01:36:12,356 --> 01:36:13,941
to recreate Ying.

780
01:36:14,107 --> 01:36:18,278
Why don't you try to recreate Enigma?

781
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:21,406
Thunder Sword will help you find the Heaven Sword,

782
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:24,409
recreating Enigma is only a matter of time.

783
01:37:47,868 --> 01:37:51,205
Omei is starting a new today.

784
01:37:51,914 --> 01:37:54,082
You don't need me anymore.

785
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:56,084
I had promised my teacher

786
01:37:57,711 --> 01:38:00,881
that I'd return to Kun Lun and rebuild the clan.

787
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:03,175
All the clans should respect

788
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:05,177
and support each other

789
01:38:07,304 --> 01:38:09,932
Omei will rely on you from now on.

790
01:38:11,183 --> 01:38:14,019
Heaven and Thunder have been born again,

791
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,646
you'll only merge successfully

792
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:18,982
if Heaven's new owner can be enlightened soon.

793
01:38:20,817 --> 01:38:23,320
It's no big deal flying around the mountains,

794
01:38:23,487 --> 01:38:25,697
I'm not interested.

795
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,867
Don't worry, I was like her before.

796
01:38:29,034 --> 01:38:32,621
I'll open up her mind soon!

797
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:34,414
I hope so.
