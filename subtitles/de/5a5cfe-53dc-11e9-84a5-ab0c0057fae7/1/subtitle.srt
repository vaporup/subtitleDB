1
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:34,972
London. The greatest city in the world.

2
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:39,752
For 22 years, I've lived here

3
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:42,621
Every morning I take a walk down this street

4
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:46,447
Every morning, the street asks me my name...

5
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:51,604
Chaudhary Baldev Singh? Who are you?
Where are you from? Why are you here?

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,592
Do I have a reply? After
half a lifetime spent here...

7
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:01,295
this land still remains alien to me: And I to it

8
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:08,654
No one here knows me. None except
these doves. Because they're like me

9
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:13,810
Neither do they belong to a country.
Just drop down where you find food

10
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,303
Have your fill, then fly on

11
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:22,834
When shall I fly? I don't know.
Of necessity, my wings are clipped

12
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:30,154
I'm shackled to my bread.
But someday I'll surely go...

13
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,643
to my land. To my Punjab

14
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:50,653
"When the koels sing in spring,
it's time again for memories"

15
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:03,502
"It's time again for swinging under the boughs"

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,659
"Come home o' wanderer, your heart beckons"

17
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:32,491
"The mute soil doesn't read your letters"

18
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:38,479
"Come, kiss your soil,
bring back the earth to life"

19
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:45,423
"Yes, you have your dreams:
But we are yours too, your kin"

20
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:50,788
"You are so forgetful, but we miss you so..."

21
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:56,027
"Come home o' wanderer, your land beckons"

22
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:24,976
Glory to The Goddess

23
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:32,038
Yes Lajjo, I'm here safe and sound.
- Good

24
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:52,830
Why is my little one giggling away?
- Mom! Every day for 20 years...

25
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,742
Dad has been walking down
the very same street...

26
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:58,652
to his very same destination.
Yet every day, you call him up...

27
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:02,851
just to ask him, "Have you reached?"
- You wonâ€™t understand

28
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:08,881
Just assume it's a ha bit.
- Ha bit left unchanged...

29
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:13,913
tends to become necessity-like.
- Philosophy, again? You're twelve

30
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:17,739
Talk like a 12-year old!
Why all this big talk?

31
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,564
There's no childhood, no adulthood.

32
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:26,721
One is as grown-up as one feels

33
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:32,376
All right! I lose! Now go to school,
chew your teacher's brains, okay?

34
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:37,739
Why d' you forget the almonds everyday?

35
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,192
What to do?
Just assume it's ha bit

36
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:45,523
Will you get out?

37
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:04,894
"This is the first time it's happening in 18 years"

38
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:08,178
"Some stranger I have never
seen, comes to my mind"

39
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,465
That's my diary!
- So what...?

40
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,542
Only I can read it.
- That was so funny

41
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:16,621
Let me read some more.
- No way! This is a private diary.

42
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:20,695
Why hide anything from me?
When a girl is grown up...

43
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:24,604
her mother becomes her friend.
Show that to me

44
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:29,760
You wonâ€™t tell anyone, will you?
- Never

45
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:35,756
All right. I'll read. You listen.
- Very well

46
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,979
"This is the first time it's happening in 18 years"

47
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:50,677
"Some stranger I have never
seen, comes to my mind..."

48
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:56,665
"shadow-like before my eyes"

49
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:01,322
"Someone raps on my heart"

50
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:06,479
"Deep eyes want me to give myself up"

51
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:11,635
"When I look at my hands,
there I see a face etched"

52
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:16,002
"A silken breath brushes my cheeks"

53
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:20,700
"My hair still smells of the o dour on his hands"

54
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:26,356
"Yes, it's happening for
the first time in 18 years"

55
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:33,848
"I've never seen this stranger
who comes to my mind"

56
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,661
Simi, you've begun writing quite well...

57
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:43,653
and the boy seems lively.
Who's he?

58
00:07:43,654 --> 00:07:46,981
Ma, I've yet to set my eyes on him

59
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:52,928
So there's no one? I was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays

60
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:57,585
And you dream of someone you
haven't even seen! Quite mad

61
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:05,860
No Ma. This is no dream

62
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:09,228
I may not have met him, seen him.

63
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:17,635
But he's there. Out there, somewhere

64
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:47,735
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

65
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:51,727
"the one who teases me..."

66
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,784
"just ask him to face me, once"

67
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:56,305
"What's he like? Who is he?
Who knows where is the one..."

68
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:09,030
"my lips will say yes to?"

69
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:14,186
"Is he someone I know? Is he a stranger?"

70
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:17,927
"Is he for real, or just a legend?"

71
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:21,671
"He stares at me, from far, far away"

72
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:25,996
"Tell him not to rob me of my sleep"

73
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:29,822
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

74
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:33,856
"the one who teases me..."

75
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:38,596
"just ask him to face me, once"

76
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:13,734
"Some kind of spell is overcoming me"

77
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,918
"Oh what do I do?
My heart yearns so"

78
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:33,902
"My heart tells me it's mad for you.
Then why do you keep hiding from me?"

79
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:38,892
"He makes me blossom, it's all his fault"

80
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:42,967
"Tell him, I'm asking for the Moon"

81
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:46,959
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

82
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,159
"the one who teases me..."

83
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:03,759
"just ask him to face me, once"

84
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:33,324
Raj! This partying all night!
Party all night and you don't sleep

85
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:37,316
And how do you get up in the morning?
Late for graduation! Hurry!

86
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:49,465
Is it a holiday...?

87
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:55,862
What Raj...?
Late for your graduation?

88
00:12:55,863 --> 00:13:00,352
What to do? Last night...

89
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:02,432
What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?

90
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,677
I hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided...

91
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:11,297
to announce his name in public

92
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,561
You've made Dharamveer Malhotra stand
an inch and a half taller in his shoes!

93
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:51,043
I don't think you heard it right.
- I knew, someday you'd make me proud!

94
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:57,239
And not only me, the whole dynasty is
proud of you! Look, they smile at you

95
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,104
My great grandfather Diwan
Brijnath never went to school

96
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:06,763
His son, my grandfather
Diwan Dwarkanath failed...

97
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:10,589
his fourth standard examinations.
My father, your grandfather...

98
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,874
Diwan Pushkarnath, failed his
eighth standard examinations

99
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,200
And I, your father, failed to matriculate

100
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:20,235
Not having an education, failing,
are family traditions. I'm happy...

101
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,729
that you have kept tradition alive,
and indeed you're two steps ahead

102
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,096
We failed back home in India.
You came to London and failed!

103
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:34,954
Are you really happy?
- Glad

104
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:38,408
Education is all useless.
Filling your head with books...

105
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:39,944
won't fill your pockets

106
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:44,604
Look at me. Runaway peasant-boy from
Bhatinda-turned millionaire in London

107
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:49,594
So, whatever happens is for the good.
Join my offices from tomorrow

108
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:52,670
Offices? From tomorrow?
- Today, if you wish

109
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,414
I can't attend office now.
- Why not?

110
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:57,908
Pops, you're a man of experience

111
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:01,070
You know what amount of hard work
it takes to fail. And Iâ€™m tired, Pops

112
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,683
I want a little rest, you know,
like along European holiday

113
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:11,839
Long European holiday? How long?
- Month or month and a half

114
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:16,165
Will you hold this for me?
And turn around

115
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:26,317
Moron! Did I bring you up to see this day?

116
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:36,464
No, don't drop that

117
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:46,694
Are you all right, Pops?

118
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,341
Pops, you're right. I ought to
take care of your business

119
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:57,664
You've become so old.
- You tell your father that?

120
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:05,233
Pops, I've decided against Europe.
I'm joining the offices from tomorrow

121
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:12,053
In this house, only your father
decides. You're going to Europe

122
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:16,045
No. I've had enough of a goodtime.
My years of youth are over for me

123
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:23,528
Never say your youth is over.

124
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,892
All my life I've slogged to give
you whatever I couldn't do

125
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:38,664
When youth came and went, I never got to know

126
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:43,074
But I wasn't sad, because I knew
that my son will have my years

127
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:49,228
If you think you've had enough of a goodtime...

128
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:52,596
if you think the years of youth are
over for you, well no problem

129
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:58,253
Just go and live my years for me

130
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:27,284
Ajit's letter?

131
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:34,264
Lajjo! Look, what's here
Letter! From my friend

132
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:37,922
From Ajit

133
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,580
Just smell it, lady!

134
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:45,406
The fragrance of Punjab!

135
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:48,110
The flavour of mustard curry
on leavened maize bread

136
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:53,806
Those long tailed shirts, the short knickers

137
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:57,010
"My dear friend Baldev,
We're fine here"

138
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:01,334
"We hope to God that you, your
wife and the children are well too"

139
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,616
"You will be pleased to hear that
my son has graduated in arts"

140
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:10,151
"He has joined my business.
By God's grace, it's time now...

141
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:13,933
for us to let our childhood
friendship mature into a relationship

142
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:18,966
Let's make good the promise we made
to each other 20 years ago. I hope...

143
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:23,000
you will come here at the soonest
for Simran's wedding to Kuljit

144
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:29,369
Read on

145
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:33,146
She's shy! See Lajjo?

146
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:37,677
That's our etiquette, our culture

147
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:42,668
My daughter is still so
shamefaced. I'm not a failure

148
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:47,491
In the heart of London, I've kept India alive!

149
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:53,147
Still staring? Lajjo, your daughter's
wedding! Celebrate it with sweets

150
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,058
Chutki! I'm so happy today

151
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,215
Can I say one thing?
- Say four things

152
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:04,084
It'd be better to ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?

153
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,700
Ever since she was a baby, she has
known that she is engaged to Kuljit

154
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:12,233
That she knows. But20 years...
- Don't you worry!

155
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:15,934
Simran is going to be so happy...

156
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:19,012
you'll pray that she never gets the evil eye!

157
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:24,375
Iâ€™ll write to Ajit right away.
God! At last, comes the day

158
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:44,543
Simran, what are you doing?

159
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:48,411
I had forgotten, Ma. I haven't
even the right to dream

160
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:53,235
No my child, of course you may dream

161
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:59,721
But don't expect them to come true

162
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:02,800
And who know, Kuljit might
be the man of your dreams

163
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,289
I don't care. I've bought your tickets.

164
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,116
You're coming to Europe with me
- I can't

165
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:13,778
Babujiwon't let me go to college
alone. Will he let me go away...

166
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:17,769
touring Europe for a month?

167
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,928
I have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years

168
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,921
Can't you make up an excuse?

169
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:28,414
An excuse, I can find. But I
don't feel like lying to Babuji

170
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:41,387
Let me talk to Matonight

171
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,633
Europe?
- Yes

172
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:46,419
With friends?
- Yes

173
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,451
For a month?
- Yes

174
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:55,485
Chutki, call the doctor. Tell him that
our Simran has gone stark mad

175
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:02,304
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first

176
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,672
You talk of traveling by Eurail? If
he hears, he'll bring the roof down

177
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:12,326
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
- Mom, I'm not going to be alone

178
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:17,025
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me

179
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:21,016
I'm not going to object. But
you will need his permission

180
00:21:21,017 --> 00:21:26,006
Ask him when he's home

181
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:32,335
God, please keep Babuji in a nice mood

182
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:54,575
It's just beer. It's over there.
- I told you. The store is shut

183
00:21:56,031 --> 00:22:01,402
Get out

184
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,177
Got the beer?
- Didn't find any

185
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:08,547
Can't even do such a simple job?
- That was an angry man

186
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:14,708
I'll get it.
- You wonâ€™t

187
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:22,726
Can I have an Aspirin?
- The store is shut

188
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:26,428
My head is about to crack up! It's sinusitis

189
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,382
If I can't find an Aspirin, I'll faint.

190
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:30,502
All the other stores are shut

191
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:36,076
Please let me have one Aspirin. One
Hindustani ought to help another

192
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:55,626
Glory to The Goddess.
- Here you are

193
00:22:56,285 --> 00:23:00,617
I'm feeling bad about forcing you to
open your store for a small medicine

194
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:05,600
I'd like to buy some other things from you

195
00:23:11,754 --> 00:23:14,248
I'll pick up some beer.
Not for myself.

196
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:18,406
My friends out there, they drink

197
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:21,608
Put it down.
- Why sir?

198
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,645
Are you trying to con me? You
aren't getting anything. Put it down

199
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,804
You're getting worked up over
nothing. This is for your profit

200
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:31,672
Will you put it down?
- Not that umbrella

201
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:37,994
Here you are. A pound extra?
No two. Keep it, okay?

202
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:41,943
Shameless!

203
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:46,143
You call yourself a Hindustani?
You give India a bad name

204
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,963
You're a liar and insolent!
Get out of here

205
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:58,667
I'm off. I'll keep this

206
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:11,682
Rev up!

207
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:41,539
Babuji

208
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:54,881
What is the matter? You're late.
- Bloody shameless scoundrel

209
00:24:56,003 --> 00:25:01,624
They call themselves Hindustani! Blot
on India! Ought to drown themselves

210
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:08,062
Rascals! No shame, no decency.
How to respect their elders...

211
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:12,220
they don't even know.
- Have you had a fight?

212
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:18,250
Scum! He came for beer. I told him
the store is shut. He took it perforce

213
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:22,076
He even broke the statue of
The Goddess! Bloody half-caste!

214
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:26,401
I say Lajjo, thank God that
you and your daughters...

215
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,479
haven't been marred by this British ness!

216
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,557
Else, you wouldâ€™ve been nowhere!

217
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:37,628
Dam these scoundrels!

218
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:43,284
Set sail in stormy waters, and
you're in danger of sinking

219
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,336
You were so little when we
brought you here. And now...

220
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:45,493
They said that a grown-up
daughter is a burden on a man

221
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:52,354
But a daughter like you, makes
a father's chest swell with pride!

222
00:26:55,015 --> 00:27:00,137
You're my good girl

223
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:06,326
Will you give something if I ask you?
- Whatever you wish

224
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:14,816
I want to take a look at Europe

225
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:21,919
Eurail is offering a monthâ€™s tour.
All my friends are going

226
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,897
Please don't be cross. I have
never disobeyed you, Babuji

227
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:38,553
I'll be going away to a land I have never seen

228
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:44,375
The man I'm going to marry
is a complete stranger. But...

229
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:49,240
I have no complaints. You must've
considered it in my best interests

230
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,729
But I won't get a chance like this ever again.

231
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,051
I don't even know whether I'll ever come back...

232
00:28:00,052 --> 00:28:03,211
whether I will have these friends later on

233
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:09,741
Besides, it's only for a month. In
a month, I will have lived a lifetime

234
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:18,390
For the sake of my happiness, won't
you let me have a month of my life?

235
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:25,625
Please Babuji, give me one month

236
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:41,094
Go. Live it up

237
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:49,875
My baby

238
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,071
Where's Simran?

239
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:55,482
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?

240
00:28:57,145 --> 00:29:00,804
I told you to wake up Raj
Did you?

241
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:05,801
No

242
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,723
Open sesame

243
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:07,096
Do you have the keys to this?

244
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:15,578
Anybody home?

245
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:21,566
No one at home

246
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:16,782
Haven't I seen you somewhere?

247
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,937
At Robbie's party, no?

248
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:25,764
I don't go to parties.
- Great! Nor do I, ever

249
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:44,477
Your eyes...

250
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:47,304
What's wrong with my eyes?

251
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:51,296
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?

252
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:57,658
My grandmother. Like you, her eyes
too had hues of yellows and blues

253
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:19,863
Keep reading. I only wanted to find
out how you read upside-down

254
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:22,690
This is the limit!

255
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:27,182
Simran, you're here?

256
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:30,675
I heard you've missed the train.
- No, I took it

257
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:34,834
I was afraid...
- By the way, what's your name?

258
00:32:35,084 --> 00:32:36,415
Sheena

259
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:40,491
Here I am. Shall we...?
- Take it easy

260
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,535
Pump it up
- It's pumped. Look

261
00:32:58,536 --> 00:33:00,614
It's nothing.
- Raj, where have you been?

262
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,860
As usual. Caught up with a girl

263
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:06,231
Girl...?
- I help her onto the train

264
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,848
And she falls for me.
- What...?

265
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:12,716
He bored me. He had me all
alone, and he began flirting

266
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:16,665
Same old hat... haven't I seen you before?

267
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,828
She sidled up to me.
- What?

268
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:22,240
I was scared! Only so much
space, and there she was with me

269
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:27,396
Then?
- Then what? She was lost in my eyes

270
00:33:27,397 --> 00:33:32,262
He was after my eyes. Wouldn't
shut up. Boys these days...

271
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,378
These girls! I just managed
to come out unscathed

272
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:42,247
What's that?
- Invitation to a party

273
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:12,638
I told you. It'll be a bore.
- You prophesied a train crash

274
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,421
And then we'd all be charred alive
after supper in a dinner-hall fire

275
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:21,911
Look, boys.
- Where...?

276
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:25,694
He's the one

277
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:31,816
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?

278
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,132
Us? Or the waiters?
- For me.

279
00:34:38,296 --> 00:34:42,121
Rocky shut your trap

280
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:47,493
Why did you have to call him?

281
00:34:56,925 --> 00:35:00,876
You know Sheena, haven't I seen you before?

282
00:35:01,707 --> 00:35:06,032
Me? Really? Where?
- At Robbie's party?

283
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:14,099
You might've. I go to so many parties

284
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,509
You know Sheena...
- What?

285
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:21,834
Your eyes remind me of someone.
- My eyes? Really? Whom?

286
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:28,328
My grandmother

287
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:36,386
Is she singing or crying?
And I can play better piano

288
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,878
You know how to play the piano?

289
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:45,368
I was born on a piano. Been playing
the piano ever since I was a baby

290
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:51,899
You know, I've magic in my fingers.
No sooner than I touch the piano...

291
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:57,892
it starts playing

292
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:09,868
Isn't that voice familiar?

293
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,053
Was this necessary?

294
00:36:39,054 --> 00:36:45,457
Doesn't the magic in your fingers
make pianos start playing?

295
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:40,108
"Stop, my wild lover"

296
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:45,970
"I've got to ask you something"

297
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:50,253
"What are you, girl or magic?"

298
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:56,083
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

299
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:16,659
"Come, let me touch you"

300
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:22,106
"Wait, my wild love"

301
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:27,977
"I've got to ask you something"

302
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:04,314
"Look at me, smiling, unknowing"

303
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:07,891
"I'm waiting for you, holding my heart"

304
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:13,046
"She looks subdued"

305
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:18,534
"But she has lots to say"

306
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:22,236
"If you say yes, I have something to say"

307
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:27,516
"Wait, my wild love"

308
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:32,173
"I've got to ask you something"

309
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:36,665
"What are you, girl or magic?"

310
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:42,702
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

311
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,558
"You aren't the only pretty woman around"

312
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:15,254
"Why are you the only one who's cross?"

313
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:22,449
"The one I've fallen for, is someone else"

314
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:27,772
"If she says yes, Iâ€™ll take her in my arms"

315
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:33,260
"Wait, my wild love"

316
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:37,418
"I've got to ask you something"

317
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:40,580
"What are you, girl or magic?"

318
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:46,608
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

319
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:50,351
"Come, let me touch you"

320
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:48,152
About last night, I'm ashamed

321
00:43:48,153 --> 00:43:51,854
I misbehaved with you

322
00:44:17,177 --> 00:44:21,335
I wanted to tell you something else

323
00:44:21,336 --> 00:44:24,703
What...?
- This

324
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:29,036
Run

325
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:53,736
First come, first served

326
00:44:54,021 --> 00:45:00,224
Hurry! The train is about to leave.
- Where did I keep my money?

327
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,957
One minute, I don't know how to count
this currency... lots of small change

328
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,947
Can you tell me one, two's, eighths...?

329
00:45:15,436 --> 00:45:20,766
Stop

330
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:29,415
Train's gone?

331
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:37,307
The train is gone!

332
00:45:37,308 --> 00:45:42,680
Don't cry, Senorita

333
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:48,119
But you just stopped crying

334
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,821
It's raining! Don't cry, please!
I'm with you, I'm here! Look

335
00:45:53,943 --> 00:45:58,475
Okay, I'm gone... gone!
Here's your bell

336
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:21,428
The next train is very late.
To catch up with the train...

337
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:26,003
at Zurich tomorrow morning, we
can either take a bus or hire a car

338
00:46:26,502 --> 00:46:32,663
What would be your pleasure?
Bus or car? Where's she?

339
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:36,148
Ever since you met me,
you've been harassing me

340
00:46:36,149 --> 00:46:38,644
What are you saying?
- All along the trip...

341
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:40,515
you've been chewing my brains.
- I...?

342
00:46:40,516 --> 00:46:44,050
Something's always the problem
with you. Today, I've missed...

343
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:46,128
the train, thanks to you.
- To me...?

344
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:51,244
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
So you go your way, I'll go mine

345
00:46:52,534 --> 00:46:56,899
Strange! We're fellow-travelers,
on the same destination, same train

346
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:02,555
Why split up? Besides, aman like
me ought to stay with a girl like you

347
00:47:02,763 --> 00:47:10,039
Wrong! A girl like me doesn't need
a guy like you. Stop pursuing me

348
00:47:23,388 --> 00:47:28,177
I'll sew it up. I have a thread and
needle. I'll buy you anew dress

349
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:49,973
What have you got yourself into?

350
00:49:09,343 --> 00:49:14,499
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?

351
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,740
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you

352
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:20,986
And I don't fancy touching you. Thank
your stars I came in the nick of time

353
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:24,522
Else, you wouldâ€™ve been in jail.
I help her, and she says this

354
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:30,140
Hey, take her away

355
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:19,369
What did you say?

356
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,861
I got carried away

357
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:27,229
Never mind Senorita, never mind. In
big places, such small things happen

358
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:34,629
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain

359
00:50:37,457 --> 00:50:42,282
Why did you dump her?
- She hated Indians

360
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:50,431
You like Indians, don't you?
- When do we reach Zurich?

361
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:55,920
What's in Zurich?
This is the real Europe

362
00:50:55,921 --> 00:51:01,333
So beautiful, so pretty. Sometimes,
I fear, it might become dirty

363
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:06,773
Here for the first time?
- Yes

364
00:51:06,774 --> 00:51:09,767
Will you drive faster?
- What's the hurry Senorita?

365
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:13,843
Train leaves Zurich at 11:30tomorrow.
We have a whole night and half a day

366
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:18,292
We'll be there on time.
- Still, if we could...

367
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:21,451
What had to happen, has happened.
Now you're with me

368
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:26,824
Nothing can go wrong

369
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:43,831
Europe is best done on foot

370
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:53,847
Just the four of us.
Chutki is way ahead of her years

371
00:51:55,509 --> 00:52:00,666
And Ma's more a friend than a mother.
So I never felt the need for a friend

372
00:52:03,827 --> 00:52:08,650
You can't live the rest of your life
with friends. Sometime or the other...

373
00:52:08,983 --> 00:52:13,349
you will need someone who
will walk by you all your life

374
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,878
Can't walk anymore. Iâ€™m tired.
- Do I pick you up in my arms?

375
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:27,072
I can't afford a hotel. Let's try that
house. We might find lodgings

376
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:42,838
Come. Arrangements for the night is done

377
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:52,062
Which is your room?

378
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:55,389
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room

379
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:01,544
And we spend the night in the same
room? You presume somewhat like that?

380
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:05,868
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling

381
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:10,027
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed. Iâ€™ll take the sofa

382
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:15,016
No problems.
- No way. I'm leaving

383
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:20,763
I'm not joking. I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?

384
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:10,904
So nice... so romantic!

385
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:14,107
And these curtains... so nice!

386
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:20,219
And the view!

387
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,381
No horses?

388
00:54:22,382 --> 00:54:25,916
It's so warm in here

389
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:31,321
There! You have a fire going

390
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:35,481
Granted. You have a great sense of choice

391
00:54:37,144 --> 00:54:42,134
You couldn't find a better place
to spend the night, right?

392
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:49,119
We were getting a nice room

393
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,445
But you'd rather spend the night with
me in the stables. Not in the room

394
00:54:57,479 --> 00:55:00,888
Eat
- I'm not hungry

395
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:07,708
All right. Don't eat.
How am I bothered?

396
00:55:44,385 --> 00:55:47,876
Eat it

397
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,370
I told you. I'm not hungry.

398
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:56,700
Come on now. Eat

399
00:55:58,357 --> 00:56:03,686
What did you say?

400
00:56:05,384 --> 00:56:10,755
I got carried away

401
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:17,983
Never mind. In big places,
such small things happen

402
00:56:17,984 --> 00:56:21,435
You were right, Senorita.
The spirit of adventure in this barn...

403
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:26,217
you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?

404
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:31,582
No, not Zurich. Tomorrow evening, we
entrain at Berne. Tomorrow morning...

405
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:38,076
we take the first bus at eight.
I've found out everything

406
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:44,438
Now, nothing can go wrong

407
00:57:08,882 --> 00:57:14,627
What's that?
- Life

408
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,487
Aren't you ashamed to drink
in the presence of a lady?

409
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:21,648
Better than dying before the
lady! If you wish to live on...

410
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,307
you too should have a bit, Senorita.
- Don't you dare come near me

411
00:57:26,305 --> 00:57:31,634
All right, don't

412
00:57:41,442 --> 00:57:44,894
I'll see you tomorrow morning if you're still alive.

413
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:51,179
Until then, goodnight

414
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:47,808
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

415
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:51,343
"May I try a pirouette?
- Oh no!"

416
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:54,587
"How about a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

417
00:58:55,044 --> 00:58:59,452
"Let me fly with the wind"

418
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:06,605
"God! Help me"

419
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:10,975
"The chill in the breeze sets my body afire"

420
01:00:12,473 --> 01:00:16,464
"I feel like..."

421
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:19,624
"making love to you"

422
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:22,950
"This never happened before"

423
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:26,278
"I've taken my first step"

424
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:31,144
"Let me fly with the wind"

425
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:38,504
"God! Help me"

426
01:00:41,664 --> 01:00:44,865
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

427
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,526
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

428
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:52,184
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

429
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:24,536
"Where do you think you're
going, my darling, my love...?"

430
01:01:26,034 --> 01:01:31,689
"You're a pretty girl. I'm a handsome young man"

431
01:01:33,352 --> 01:01:36,969
"Come into my embrace"

432
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:40,462
"Let me hold you in my eyes"

433
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:44,788
"Oh, I'm drunk"

434
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:52,273
"God! Help me"

435
01:01:55,308 --> 01:01:58,385
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

436
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,710
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

437
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:05,786
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

438
01:02:05,787 --> 01:02:10,237
"Oh, I'm ecstatic"

439
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:17,930
"God! Help me"

440
01:03:17,436 --> 01:03:22,973
Up in the mornings, you look even prettier

441
01:03:29,993 --> 01:03:33,653
How did I get here?

442
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:38,309
With me. Last night

443
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:42,635
I don't think you've ever had a drink before

444
01:03:42,636 --> 01:03:45,795
And you had one too many

445
01:03:45,796 --> 01:03:49,120
Have this

446
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:53,861
What happened last night?

447
01:03:53,862 --> 01:04:00,058
What happened last night, was bound to happen

448
01:04:03,676 --> 01:04:06,712
But I didn't imagine it'd happen this way

449
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:12,158
Tell me the truth, Raj!
What happened last night?

450
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,025
How do I answer this question, Simran?

451
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:22,180
Look, look into my eyes.
Aren't my eyes telling the truth?

452
01:04:25,008 --> 01:04:30,080
No! This could never have happened

453
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:33,740
This could never have happened.
- That's exactly what happened, Simran

454
01:04:36,734 --> 01:04:40,060
Who can stop what is to happen?

455
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:43,054
You're lying!
You're lying, aren't you?

456
01:04:43,055 --> 01:04:46,963
No Simran.
- Please tell me you're lying

457
01:04:46,964 --> 01:04:50,666
Granted! I'm lying, my eyes are lying.

458
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:57,733
But are these love-bites lying?

459
01:04:57,734 --> 01:04:59,231
Speak

460
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:03,140
Tell me Simran! Are these yours?
Or someone else's?

461
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:06,923
Don't cry! I was just joking

462
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:10,460
Those aren't real! Look! I used your lipstick

463
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:16,448
You only had one too many,
and you were dripping wet

464
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:19,773
I had no options. I had to bring
you here. I swear, I'm just joking

465
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:23,765
You were all alone on the bed. I slept
out there. I'm just joking! I swear

466
01:05:24,015 --> 01:05:29,261
Don't cry, don't

467
01:05:32,955 --> 01:05:40,150
I know what you think of me.
You think I'm a wastrel

468
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:48,134
I'm not scum, Simran. I'm Hindustani

469
01:05:49,796 --> 01:05:54,785
And I know what honor means
for the Hindustani woman

470
01:05:54,786 --> 01:06:00,277
Not even in my dreams can I imagine
doing that to you. Trust me, Simran

471
01:06:01,108 --> 01:06:08,177
I'm saying the truth. Last night,
nothing happened. Just a joke

472
01:06:19,322 --> 01:06:23,022
Please, never joke about that.
You don't know what I would've done

473
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:28,800
Please, no jokes like that

474
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:34,506
I promise never to crack a joke like that

475
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:59,158
Get changed. Fast.
We got to catch the bus

476
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:04,529
May I have my shirt back?

477
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:24,897
Fifteen minutes before the bus
leaves. You want to eat something?

478
01:07:24,898 --> 01:07:30,269
No, I'm not hungry

479
01:07:33,713 --> 01:07:36,956
Come on, let's take a look inside.
- Churches aren't worth a look

480
01:07:36,957 --> 01:07:42,328
I'm not going

481
01:07:43,902 --> 01:07:49,231
Go on. Take a look

482
01:08:25,985 --> 01:08:31,147
What?
- Hurry up. We'll miss the bus

483
01:09:03,658 --> 01:09:07,525
Shall we?
- Why not leave after tea?

484
01:09:12,807 --> 01:09:17,007
What did you ask for?
- You aren't supposed to speak of it

485
01:09:18,462 --> 01:09:22,121
Then you must be sure about
being given what you've asked for

486
01:09:22,122 --> 01:09:26,155
Whatever one seeks with
a pure heart, one is surely given

487
01:09:29,857 --> 01:09:32,018
Go on. I'll be back in a minute.
- What happened?

488
01:09:32,019 --> 01:09:37,390
Go on. Iâ€™ll join you

489
01:09:47,154 --> 01:09:49,816
I'm Raj

490
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:55,014
I'm sorry, I don't know how to pray.
But I want nothing for myself

491
01:09:57,218 --> 01:10:03,248
But that girl Simran, she's nice.
Very good at heart

492
01:10:04,411 --> 01:10:10,283
Give her whatever she asked for

493
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:26,533
Where have you been?

494
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:31,905
In the church?

495
01:10:39,592 --> 01:10:43,292
Half a teaspoon of sugar, one spoon
of milk, bit of cream. Your coffee

496
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,905
You want a postcard to send home?
- Postcard? For home?

497
01:10:48,906 --> 01:10:53,895
If that postcard reaches home,
my Pop will give me up for dead

498
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:56,224
When were you last serious?
- Till now, never

499
01:10:56,225 --> 01:11:00,881
If ever, it'll happen only once.
- When?

500
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,917
When I'm in love

501
01:11:03,918 --> 01:11:07,285
A boy like you was never in love?
- I've had many affairs

502
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:11,653
But I was never in love, Senorita.
Never found one

503
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:15,644
What kind of girl are you looking for?

504
01:11:15,645 --> 01:11:18,970
Want me to tell you?

505
01:11:18,971 --> 01:11:21,382
The moment I look at her...

506
01:11:21,383 --> 01:11:25,791
all my heart's desires, all
my dreams will come alive

507
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:33,275
Has never happened. But now I hear
a voice, behind the clouds, calling

508
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:42,881
She's a stranger, a face I've never
seen before. When will the clouds part?

509
01:11:47,996 --> 01:11:51,364
Has it never happened with you?
- No

510
01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:55,855
No stranger ever invaded your dreams?

511
01:11:57,311 --> 01:12:03,514
No place for strangers in my dreams

512
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:08,670
I am engaged to marry

513
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:15,856
Engaged to marry?
- Yes

514
01:12:15,857 --> 01:12:19,059
Where's the fiancÃ©? In London?
- No, in India

515
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,343
Looks...?

516
01:12:22,344 --> 01:12:27,499
Don't know. Never seen him

517
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,368
You've never seen the man
you're going to marry?

518
01:12:32,324 --> 01:12:36,856
Not necessary. My father has
seen him. His friend's son

519
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:46,047
You'll spend your life with
someone you've never met?

520
01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:52,241
A complete stranger?

521
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:56,234
That's how it happens with us.
- And you're happy with this decision?

522
01:13:10,705 --> 01:13:16,077
The train is here

523
01:13:56,821 --> 01:14:03,475
Lovely photographs. Send me a set of
copies. And your wedding photos too

524
01:14:03,974 --> 01:14:07,300
Won't you be there at my wedding?
- Who's going to travel so far?

525
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,958
Sheena, you must!
- Just joking. Of course, I'll come

526
01:14:12,457 --> 01:14:17,113
I got to take a look at your groom.
Who knows what idiot she's marrying?

527
01:14:22,978 --> 01:14:28,349
You dropped this

528
01:15:02,273 --> 01:15:06,348
What happened? Why are you staring like that?

529
01:15:06,349 --> 01:15:10,340
I have something to tell you Simran

530
01:15:10,341 --> 01:15:13,667
Go on

531
01:15:13,668 --> 01:15:19,038
I'm in love with you

532
01:15:35,749 --> 01:15:40,071
Just look at your face

533
01:15:40,072 --> 01:15:43,898
You thought I was saying the truth?

534
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:47,100
Strange Simran!
You've known me for so long...

535
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:52,881
and you still can't make me out?
Remember? I've never been serious

536
01:15:56,873 --> 01:16:01,738
All this love etc. Is beyond me.
Still haven't been able to make out...

537
01:16:02,403 --> 01:16:07,933
how some men spend a lifetime with
one girl! It's a world full of pretty women

538
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:13,132
Someone has beautiful eyes, someone
has good lips, someone has nice hair...

539
01:16:13,589 --> 01:16:19,452
You boys are all the same.
- But you're one up on all of us

540
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:28,102
You're about to spend a lifetime with
someone you haven't even seen

541
01:16:30,389 --> 01:16:33,424
That must be true love

542
01:16:41,492 --> 01:16:45,442
Forget it. Think for a moment, what
if you're in love with someone?

543
01:16:45,982 --> 01:16:49,642
I mean, imagine you're in love with
someone you've met on this trip...

544
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:56,635
why someone? Say you're in love
with me, and I'm in love with you too

545
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:05,111
Then what will you do? Will you
go back to marry that stranger?

546
01:17:07,273 --> 01:17:10,475
Or, will you have the courage
to have an affair with me?

547
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:19,880
What will you do?

548
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:30,185
I don't want to miss the train again.
- I want to miss it again and again

549
01:17:31,475 --> 01:17:37,511
What...?
- Nothing

550
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:43,534
If she's in love with me,
she's going to turn around

551
01:17:48,358 --> 01:17:52,731
Turn

552
01:17:56,342 --> 01:18:00,715
Turn

553
01:18:46,865 --> 01:18:50,899
Back in London. How a month
passed by, I didn't even notice

554
01:19:17,554 --> 01:19:22,045
Raj, you haven't given me your address.
I'll send you my wedding invitation

555
01:19:23,417 --> 01:19:27,575
You'll come, won't you?

556
01:19:27,576 --> 01:19:32,988
No, I won't come

557
01:19:57,807 --> 01:20:03,337
"What's come over..."

558
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:09,824
"my heart?"

559
01:20:09,825 --> 01:20:17,351
"Have I lost it?"

560
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:25,001
"What's come over my heart?"

561
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:32,363
"Where have I lost it?"

562
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:53,029
"You're in love, my love"

563
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:57,687
"Try refusing a million times, but you're in love"

564
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,884
"You're in love, my love"

565
01:21:03,882 --> 01:21:07,585
"Try refusing a million times, but you're in love"

566
01:21:08,374 --> 01:21:12,283
"Darling, this is love"

567
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:26,711
"You're in love, my love"

568
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:31,578
"Try refusing a million times, but you're in love"

569
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:36,401
"Darling, this is love"

570
01:22:01,724 --> 01:22:05,758
"You didn't care to turn around..."

571
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:11,247
"but I was still waiting"

572
01:22:11,248 --> 01:22:15,490
"By the time I wanted to stop you..."

573
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:20,479
"you were too far away"

574
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,972
"What happened?
- I don't even know"

575
01:22:25,304 --> 01:22:28,628
"Why is my heart...
- In love...?"

576
01:22:30,127 --> 01:22:33,952
"You're in love, my love"

577
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,775
"Try refusing a million times, but you're in love"

578
01:22:39,606 --> 01:22:43,476
"You're in love, my love"

579
01:22:44,763 --> 01:22:48,547
"Try refusing a million times, but you're in love"

580
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:55,082
"Darling, this is love"

581
01:23:27,844 --> 01:23:31,878
"Oh time! Stop, tarry..."

582
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:37,409
"go backwards"

583
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:41,360
"I've left myself behind..."

584
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,390
"at the crossroads of life"

585
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:49,883
"Where am I...?
- Where are you?"

586
01:23:51,173 --> 01:23:54,623
"What is this...?
- Magic"

587
01:23:56,163 --> 01:24:00,114
"You're in love, my love"

588
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:04,561
"Try refusing a million times,
"You're in love, my love"

589
01:24:10,883 --> 01:24:14,583
"Try refusing a million times, but you're in love"

590
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:19,201
"Darling, this is love"

591
01:24:55,418 --> 01:25:00,119
"What's come over..."

592
01:25:02,321 --> 01:25:06,645
"my heart?"

593
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:10,638
"My heart was with me always"

594
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:14,630
"Have I lost it?"

595
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:22,289
"I've lost it"

596
01:25:37,834 --> 01:25:42,324
Ma, you remember the dream
I wrote about in my diary?

597
01:25:42,325 --> 01:25:45,359
That face I imagined holding in my hands?

598
01:25:47,149 --> 01:25:50,974
The one, I wanted to face

599
01:25:50,975 --> 01:25:54,300
I've found him

600
01:25:54,301 --> 01:25:56,962
What...?

601
01:25:56,963 --> 01:26:01,661
What are you saying, Simi?
- Yes Ma. When I was leaving...

602
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,987
I was clear about what I was getting out of life

603
01:26:04,988 --> 01:26:09,895
For a month, I wanted to be as happy
as I could. Then I'd come back...

604
01:26:10,518 --> 01:26:15,010
and go away to my country to
spend a lifetime with a stranger

605
01:26:16,008 --> 01:26:21,039
I had come to a compromise with my
destiny, Ma. But little did I know...

606
01:26:21,996 --> 01:26:26,195
this was in store for me.
Like a storm he came...

607
01:26:27,151 --> 01:26:33,355
and he swept me off like a fallen leaf

608
01:26:33,972 --> 01:26:37,381
Love's like this, like that, I had read, I had heard

609
01:26:38,379 --> 01:26:43,577
But I never understood. When, for the
first time, he offered me his hand...

610
01:26:43,827 --> 01:26:47,611
I still didn't understand. I
was with him for so long...

611
01:26:49,066 --> 01:26:54,597
still I didn't understand anything.
But today, when we were parting...

612
01:26:56,884 --> 01:27:01,250
for the first time I felt that after this moment...

613
01:27:02,207 --> 01:27:08,402
I'm not going to see him ever again. I
kept looking back. He was going away

614
01:27:09,734 --> 01:27:14,599
I wanted to stop him, I wanted to say
something, I wanted to hear something

615
01:27:16,927 --> 01:27:21,959
But he didn't stop. I understood.
This is what love is like

616
01:27:23,913 --> 01:27:30,608
And to him, I've given all my dreams. I
don't even know whether he loves me

617
01:27:32,063 --> 01:27:37,760
All I know is that for me, he's life.
I can never be anyone else's, Ma

618
01:27:55,475 --> 01:27:58,801
You're up? Simi and I have been talking

619
01:27:58,802 --> 01:28:05,129
She's back after so long.
I even lost track of time

620
01:28:18,471 --> 01:28:22,878
I told you, not to betray my trust

621
01:28:25,997 --> 01:28:30,862
I took a promise from you.
And you've deceived me?

622
01:28:31,652 --> 01:28:34,147
No Babuji...
- Listen, first ask her

623
01:28:34,148 --> 01:28:38,471
I don't want to listen to anything!

624
01:28:38,472 --> 01:28:42,838
Pack. Tomorrow morning, we leave for India

625
01:28:45,126 --> 01:28:49,997
For good

626
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,354
Let her cry

627
01:28:55,355 --> 01:28:59,179
She has writ it on her own destiny

628
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:02,674
She will have to learn for herself
how to get over it. Let her cry

629
01:29:40,556 --> 01:29:45,212
What's her name?
- Simran

630
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,206
What girl, Pops?

631
01:29:48,207 --> 01:29:52,033
The one whose face you see in the moon.

632
01:29:52,034 --> 01:29:54,444
I'm not one of them...

633
01:29:54,445 --> 01:29:57,563
who will go crazy about a girl.
- Yes, I forgot!

634
01:29:57,564 --> 01:30:03,725
Some have good lips,
some have beautiful eyes...

635
01:30:04,092 --> 01:30:08,084
Lives where?
- Who, Pops?

636
01:30:08,085 --> 01:30:13,456
This... Simran

637
01:30:15,403 --> 01:30:18,938
Don't know
- How is she?

638
01:30:20,725 --> 01:30:24,384
Very lovable

639
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:27,378
Then what's the problem?

640
01:30:27,379 --> 01:30:32,952
Problem is, she's about to marry.
- How about stopping the wedding?

641
01:30:35,321 --> 01:30:40,643
In your times, it was different.
Times have changed

642
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:45,634
Love is still called "love". That has
never changed, nor will it ever change

643
01:30:48,795 --> 01:30:52,503
She's going to be someone else's.
- The bride goes to the man...

644
01:30:52,703 --> 01:30:58,157
who brings her home. I didn't sire
you to play that fiddle. We aren't...

645
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:01,268
those who stare at the moon.
You reach out to the moon...

646
01:31:01,269 --> 01:31:04,262
you bring her home. Go

647
01:31:04,263 --> 01:31:10,467
And come home only with your bride. Get it?

648
01:31:51,336 --> 01:31:54,329
Gone. The daughter is getting married.

649
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:59,701
They've sold out and moved to Punjab

650
01:32:25,392 --> 01:32:29,217
I'm coming, Simran

651
01:32:29,218 --> 01:32:34,589
I'm coming

652
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:37,955
"When the girls go to the riverbank,
you'll hear their anklets chime"

653
01:33:38,621 --> 01:33:41,281
"When the ripe mustard sways in the farms..."

654
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:45,772
"you'll know a year has come to pass"

655
01:33:45,773 --> 01:33:50,638
"Come today, come with a smile,
bring me a song, I've been waiting..."

656
01:33:51,262 --> 01:33:55,670
"for the whistle of the chugging train"

657
01:33:56,835 --> 01:34:01,034
"Come home o' wanderer, your mate beckons"

658
01:34:02,157 --> 01:34:07,528
"Come home o' wanderer"

659
01:34:08,145 --> 01:34:11,180
"Your land beckons"

660
01:34:31,847 --> 01:34:37,219
Bless me, Ma-ji

661
01:34:43,325 --> 01:34:48,480
No Ma-ji

662
01:34:48,481 --> 01:34:52,231
Son, 20 years I've held back these tears

663
01:34:59,709 --> 01:35:04,241
Today, they won't stop, son.
Not today

664
01:35:10,894 --> 01:35:13,388
Simran, my child

665
01:35:13,389 --> 01:35:18,761
My baby doll

666
01:35:20,042 --> 01:35:23,368
How have you been?
- I haven't changed a bit!

667
01:35:23,369 --> 01:35:27,569
You're the bride's aunt now!
Time to find a good groom for yourself

668
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:30,979
Lajjo, I've been ready all these years!
But in this village...

669
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,930
there isn't one who's a match for me.
So what do I do? For me, I think...

670
01:35:35,221 --> 01:35:38,964
it'll have to be a foreigner!
- You haven't changed a bit.

671
01:35:39,213 --> 01:35:41,415
Not a bit!

672
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:45,783
You did keep us waiting.
Anyway, better late than never

673
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:49,109
Wife, will you excuse us a moment?
- Get lost

674
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:57,051
Come on. Baldev, who's this?
Go on...

675
01:35:57,052 --> 01:36:00,087
You don't know?
My daughter Preeti

676
01:36:00,545 --> 01:36:03,788
Kuljit's sister.
- May you live long

677
01:36:05,784 --> 01:36:09,153
Wonderful, isn't it? In20 years, the
whole generation has come of age

678
01:36:10,151 --> 01:36:12,228
She's beautiful.
- Father's daughter, right?

679
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:14,141
Get lost

680
01:36:14,142 --> 01:36:16,137
Where's Kuljit?
- Yes, where's Kuljit?

681
01:36:16,138 --> 01:36:22,134
Bhaiyya (Brother) is out for a hunt.
He should be back soon

682
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:45,663
My respects.
- May you live long, son

683
01:36:45,664 --> 01:36:49,655
My respects.
- May you live long, son

684
01:36:49,656 --> 01:36:53,688
That's a strong lad from Punjab.
- Whose son is he anyway?

685
01:36:53,979 --> 01:36:55,643
Get lost

686
01:36:55,644 --> 01:36:58,803
Come, breakfast is ready.
- Yes hurry. I'm famished

687
01:36:58,804 --> 01:37:01,130
Come on kids

688
01:37:01,131 --> 01:37:05,332
For you, for you and for you

689
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:08,158
You must take me out tomorrow morning.

690
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:13,158
Sure Didi (Sister)

691
01:37:39,472 --> 01:37:45,218
Kids, Grannie wants everyone downstairs

692
01:38:02,882 --> 01:38:08,373
You know Simi, when I was
a kid, my father would tell me...

693
01:38:09,702 --> 01:38:16,065
there's no difference between man
and woman. All have equal rights

694
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:23,093
All my childhood, I lived believing
it's true. But as I grew up...

695
01:38:24,755 --> 01:38:29,744
I realized what a lie that is

696
01:38:29,745 --> 01:38:32,781
I wasn't given an education,
because it was more important...

697
01:38:33,031 --> 01:38:37,106
that my brothers be educated.
That was my first sacrifice

698
01:38:39,227 --> 01:38:43,428
Then, at every step, sometimes as
daughter, sometimes as sister...

699
01:38:44,217 --> 01:38:49,746
sometimes as wife... I went on
sacrificing my own happiness

700
01:38:49,747 --> 01:38:52,740
But once you were born...

701
01:38:52,741 --> 01:38:56,982
when I held you in my hands for the first time...

702
01:38:56,983 --> 01:39:04,633
I made a promise, never to let happen
to my daughter, what happened to me

703
01:39:06,796 --> 01:39:11,455
No more sacrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife

704
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:17,277
So what if she's a girl?
She'd live her life as she wishes

705
01:39:18,441 --> 01:39:23,473
She'd have her share of happiness.
But I was wrong, Simran

706
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:29,044
I had even forgotten that a woman
hasn't even the right to make promises

707
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:37,028
She is born to be sacrificed for
their men. For their women...

708
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:41,020
men will never make sacrifices,
nor will they ever make sacrifices

709
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:47,839
Therefore I, your mother, come to
take from you, your own happiness

710
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:57,694
Forget him, my child. Forget. Because
your father won't care for your tears

711
01:40:00,316 --> 01:40:03,184
For the happiness of everyone...

712
01:40:03,185 --> 01:40:07,883
I beg of you. Forget him, my child

713
01:40:27,843 --> 01:40:30,836
You're right, Ma

714
01:40:30,837 --> 01:40:38,115
So naive of me. I don't even
know whether he loves me

715
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:45,556
And after all, Babuji is my father.
He has always cared for my happiness

716
01:40:48,717 --> 01:40:52,377
For the sake of his happiness,
can I not make this little sacrifice?

717
01:40:55,371 --> 01:41:01,900
Go Ma, go and tell Babujithat
I'm ready for the wedding

718
01:41:04,894 --> 01:41:10,223
He won't have any problems from my end
