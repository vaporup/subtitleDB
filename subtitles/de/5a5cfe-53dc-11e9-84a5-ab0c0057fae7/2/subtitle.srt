1
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,123
Your girl is beautiful

2
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:50,280
Not the girl. Kuljit is plain lucky

3
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:01,134
And my name is Rajeshwari.
Miss Rajeshwari Singh

4
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:06,207
If the little one is like this,
what will the older one be like?

5
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:11,737
I’ll tell you, after the wedding

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,981
Listen

7
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:17,060
The day after tomorrow is the engagement

8
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:22,432
The wedding is on the 25th

9
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:28,836
Sweets

10
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:18,062
I'm worried about something

11
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:23,927
I don't know why I see this
sadness in Simran's eyes.

12
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:30,747
Even her smile is hesitant.
Is everything all right?

13
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:34,030
It's nothing, Ma

14
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:40,727
It's a new place, it's a change.
In a few days, she'll adjust

15
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:45,424
Don't worry for nothing

16
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:50,081
Here you are, kheer

17
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:55,613
Simran hasn't forgotten him yet?
- She has agreed to get married

18
00:02:56,403 --> 00:03:01,934
By and by she will forget everything.
- If she remembers, she'll regret it

19
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:18,697
"I saw you, I realized..."

20
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,880
"what madness love is"

21
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,261
"When I saw you, I realized..."

22
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:35,293
"what madness love is"

23
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:50,596
"From here, where to?"

24
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:55,586
"Just let me die in your arms"

25
00:06:56,297 --> 00:07:00,164
"My eyes... dream of you"

26
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,528
"My heart holds memories of you"

27
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:10,019
"Nothing's mine. It's all yours"

28
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:15,841
"My life, my breath is yours"

29
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:19,542
"When I weep for you, your tears..."

30
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,033
"my sorrows begin to smile"

31
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:29,023
"I saw you, I realized..."

32
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:34,347
"what madness love is"

33
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:41,132
"From here, where to?"

34
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,409
"Just let me die in your arms"

35
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,929
"I don't feel like anything"

36
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:21,668
"What do I say, what do I do?"

37
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,951
"In front of me... just keep sitting"

38
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:31,897
"Just let me look at you"

39
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:36,098
"You called out to me, and look, here I am"

40
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:39,923
"What greater than the promise to love?"

41
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:45,121
"I saw you, I realized..."

42
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:50,153
"what madness love is"

43
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:55,143
"I saw you, I realized..."

44
00:08:56,972 --> 00:09:00,133
"what madness love is"

45
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:05,123
"From here, where to?"

46
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:10,113
"Just let me die in your arms"

47
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:04,669
Take me away from here, Raj.
Take me away from here!

48
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,371
What...?
- You don't know...

49
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:11,698
what's going on in there!
Day after tomorrow is the engagement

50
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:16,688
The wedding is after a fortnight.
All arrangements are in place

51
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:22,718
Babuji gave his word to his friend.
And he lives by his word

52
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:28,206
He can do anything, but he
can't go back on his word

53
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:37,063
We have to run from here. We must!
- No Simran. I'm not eloping

54
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:41,887
I haven't come here to steal you. I
might have been born in England

55
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:48,873
But I am Hindustani. I've come
here to take you as my bride.

56
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:56,566
I’ll take you only when your
Babuji gives me your hand

57
00:10:57,065 --> 00:11:00,724
You don't know my Babuji!

58
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:04,134
We have to get away from here, Raj.
Please Raj, take me away from here

59
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:12,951
Do you love me?
- More than anyone else

60
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,774
Do you trust me?
- More than I trust myself

61
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,258
Then listen carefully to what
I'm going to say. From now on...

62
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:30,789
we're strangers. I don't know you
and you don't know me. Go back

63
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:35,778
Let things happen as they're happening.
Leave the rest to me

64
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:41,310
What I'm up to is daunting. But I
have complete faith in our love.

65
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:46,300
But alone... I cannot tread upon this path.

66
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:49,043
You will have to be my strength

67
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:54,617
You must co-operate. Tell
me, will you stand by me?

68
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:05,303
Remember one more thing.
I'm here only for your sake.

69
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:13,038
Till I have you for lifetime's
sakes, I am not leaving

70
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:24,646
Listen, what's the name of
the one you're marrying?

71
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:30,178
Kuljit Singh

72
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:59,278
Help!
Anybody here?

73
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,107
Somebody, help me!

74
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:05,475
Where's everyone? Help!

75
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:31,846
Anybody around?

76
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:41,653
Had Raj not arrived in the nick
of time, I would've been the prey

77
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:45,684
Raj, I'm sold out!

78
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:49,718
- What are you saying?
- Where are you from?

79
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:53,378
I've never seen you before
- I'm from London

80
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,705
Our guest from London!

81
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:04,191
What have you come here for?
- To achieve something

82
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:08,348
To achieve what? Do tell us

83
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,511
Land... land.
- Land...?

84
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:14,835
Yes, if I could find a good stretch
of land, I want to set up a factory

85
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,200
Factory, making what?
- Beer

86
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,394
Tell me something, Kuljit.
Will8-10 million pounds...

87
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:30,719
be enough to set up a factory?

88
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,963
What happened?
- 8-10 million pounds?

89
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:39,413
Too less? I can get more.
- No! That's a lot. Enough

90
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:47,063
God is great! He makes us meet.
We'll get along fine together

91
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:51,388
You want to set up a factory?
As good as done

92
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,090
Done, my man

93
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:57,581
By the way Raj...

94
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:03,281
where are you staying?
- You see, I don't know anyone around

95
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,233
So I'm putting up at the Circuit House.

96
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:09,891
Strange! Now you know me

97
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:14,590
I have a palatial house! And you'll
stay at the circuit house? No way!

98
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,708
Binda, go and get his luggage from
the circuit house. Drop it home

99
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,702
What are you doing, Kuljit?
- Not a word

100
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:24,281
You've saved my life, saved Kuljit!
Can't I do as much for you?

101
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:28,937
I know, you're from London.
Here in Punjab, we're lions

102
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,305
You're going to enjoy yourselves.
- Well, if you're forcing me...

103
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:36,463
as you wish.
- That's like it!

104
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:41,121
What about babes?

105
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:43,449
We'll have a blast!

106
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,610
You haven't gone yet?

107
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,273
Go on Binda, hurry up.
Get a Black Label for Raj

108
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:53,594
I'm going to have a scotch with Raj

109
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:58,130
Show me a cigarette, man. Strange!
The lighter too

110
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,359
You have done us a great
favor in saving Kuljit's life

111
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,681
No, it was my duty.
- May you live long, son

112
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,841
Preeti, give Raj some sweets

113
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:28,027
Enough

114
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,687
10 million pounds! Why
didn't you tell me before?

115
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:34,971
I was about to...
- Raj! My son!

116
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:36,717
The sweets.
- I have some

117
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:40,542
Let me feed you. That's like it!
You want to set up a factory, no?

118
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:43,870
We'll set it up for you.
- What was I telling you?

119
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,530
Get dressed fast. We're
going to Baldev's for lunch

120
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:49,524
Who's Baldev?
- He's my friend, man!

121
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:55,512
His daughter is marrying my Kuljit

122
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:59,672
What am I going to do over there?
- That's true. What will he do there?

123
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:03,706
But if you insist, I'll come along.
- That's like it!

124
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:09,777
Baldev is a bit British.
He'll mind it if we're late

125
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,562
Let's make it on time.
- That's like it!

126
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:16,222
You get dressed fast. We're
always getting late because of you

127
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:19,423
Kuljit, I have something to tell you.
- Don't worry about the factory

128
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:25,204
I have...

129
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:30,577
I’ll take all of it

130
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,394
Compliments

131
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:54,777
My compliments

132
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,615
Listen...
- I...?

133
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,443
How did the shopkeeper get here?

134
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,800
I've seen you somewhere before.
- Not me. I never step out of the house

135
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:25,792
In London...?
- But I haven't been beyond Ludhiana

136
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:30,448
Have you met my friend Raj?
He has just arrived from London

137
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:33,608
What are you saying?
- Balli, the doctor...

138
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:37,982
Raj is the one who saved
Kuljit's life yesterday

139
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:41,802
You know who this is? The oldest
of my friends. My kinsmanto-be

140
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,957
What are you staring at?
Touch his feet

141
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,079
My respects

142
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,277
Hurry! The doctor has been
asking for you for ages

143
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:56,812
This doctor is a wonderful fellow.
Come on, man

144
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,138
Old foggy has quite a memory.
- What happened?

145
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,339
Nothing. This is great! Lovely house!
- I told you

146
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,944
This is Raj. My friend.
He has come from London

147
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:18,351
This is Simran

148
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:20,347
Namaste, Simran-ji

149
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:25,214
Were it not for him yesterday, you
and I wouldn't be here together

150
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:31,001
What a thing to say...

151
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:42,013
Very glad to meet you, Ms Rajeshwari

152
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:48,668
What is this?
- A little gift. For a little bride

153
00:19:57,067 --> 00:20:02,598
Mr. Raj, folks I like can call me Chutki

154
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:10,083
And folks who like me, call me Raj. Only Raj

155
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:18,191
Namaste, Simran-ji.
- Namaste

156
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:23,230
Come on now

157
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,751
This is Raj, my British friend

158
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:32,412
The one I told you about.
- My respects

159
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,657
May you live long, son.
- Coming

160
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:38,733
Have some.
- Thanks Ma-ji (Mother)

161
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:43,057
Let me do the rest for you.
- No, you belong to the grooms people

162
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:46,260
You're our guest.
- How strange of you

163
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:50,751
A moment ago you called me your son.
The next moment, you disown me?

164
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:57,411
Allow me

165
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:04,142
Just try this lassi. I made it with
my own hands! Here you are, Aunt

166
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,135
Here you are Parjai-ji (Aunt).
This is for you, Aunt

167
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,962
That's a lovely dress

168
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:14,452
Excuse me...

169
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:19,451
After you

170
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:27,426
Why are you taking all this trouble?
We kids can manage. Allow me

171
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:30,296
That's what I've been saying all
along. But no one will listen to me

172
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:32,458
I've been given all the work.
- That's my point

173
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,952
Hey... who are you?
- I...? I'm Raj

174
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:40,318
Raj, who...?
- Your son-in-law to-be

175
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,312
Kuljit is your son-in-law to-be, no? I'm his friend

176
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:47,014
Darling boy! Put the glasses there.
- Sure

177
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:52,177
Such a darling!

178
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,659
Today I see the best sign!
For the first time...

179
00:21:57,908 --> 00:22:03,986
I'm seeing Simran laughing with such mirth!

180
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,891
Give that to me.
- I won't

181
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:14,043
True, Ma-ji. Simran looks very cheerful

182
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:57,669
Son of an Englishman! Get up!
Hurry! We're going hunting

183
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:05,110
Look at him
Aren't you coming? Get up.

184
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,939
I'm sick. I have high fever

185
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,431
Caught such a chill last night,
I slept in my shoes, you know

186
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:14,593
You're wearing only one shoe.
- That's the leg that caught the chill

187
00:24:15,258 --> 00:24:21,453
Sorry friend, I just can't go hunting with you

188
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:24,988
You British are so feeble.
I'll send medicines for you

189
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:26,776
Make sure you're fine by this evening.

190
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:29,478
We're having fowl for dinner.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

191
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:34,352
Hey Kuljit...

192
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:40,955
Come on Raj, get started

193
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:44,159
What's this?
- Keep moving

194
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:49,523
What's all this Raj?
- Wonderful thing happened today

195
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:54,680
Met a minister on my way. Turns out
to be my Daddy's childhood friend

196
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:58,214
He gave me all this. Let me take
care of that. Don't tire yourself

197
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:02,372
I'm alone fellow you know. What use
this sugar, rice and wheat for me?

198
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:05,116
So I thought I'd bring it over.
There's a wedding in the offing here

199
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:08,026
Could be useful, no?
- Maybe so, son

200
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:10,522
But we're the brides people.
Can't take anything from you

201
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:14,182
Not again. Once and for all,
decide what you take me for

202
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:17,675
Either you don't call me a
son, or you treat me like a son

203
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:21,666
How do you treat sons?
- You don't argue with sons

204
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:25,492
All right. I won't argue.
- That's like it

205
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:28,694
Now listen to the real thing, Ma-ji.
My mother used to say...

206
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,268
one who helps out with a
wedding, gets a pretty bride

207
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:38,923
All this, for a pretty bride?
- What else? Only lucky ones...

208
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:42,250
find good brides nowadays.
- What kind of bride do you want?

209
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:50,401
Say, someone like you

210
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:54,808
Don't say that.
Give me your blessings.

211
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:57,760
Granted. You'll get a bride you want

212
00:25:57,761 --> 00:26:03,881
All right, I'm off.
- Will you please open this?

213
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:08,531
It's going to open

214
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:11,775
Aunt, don't keep looking,
don't even think. Just take it

215
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,726
Stuff like this is hard to find
even in Delhi or Bombay

216
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:17,929
Just wear it and step out, and
you'll make the girls stare

217
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:21,921
Don't even ask me about the boys
- It's nice

218
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,569
Not special

219
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,479
You show me that one.
- Okay. Here you are

220
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:40,176
Superb stuff. Just take a look at
the borders. On you, resplendent

221
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:46,121
Such bad ones! If you have
something special, show me

222
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:49,282
I have to wear it for the wedding.
- Here you are

223
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:53,775
This is for weddings. If you aren't
pleased, I'm no connoisseur

224
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:58,598
Pure goldthread.
On you, looks exotic!

225
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:05,466
Don't talk rot! It's not that good

226
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:11,363
Not that bad either. I'll keep it

227
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:20,969
Pack it. And put a good price

228
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:26,508
You've worn me out

229
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,519
Raj, let's have a song from you.
- I can't sing

230
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:01,596
Coy like a girl? Sing.
- Oh no Grannie...

231
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:06,336
Sing... please

232
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:12,374
I'm in love, why am I afraid?

233
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,318
I've loved, I haven't stolen anything

234
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:21,107
Why should I weep secretly?

235
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:26,046
I'll live for love, I'll die for love

236
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:30,414
What else have I to do?
- I'm in love, why am I afraid?

237
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:38,398
You've got your aim all wrong

238
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,088
Forget it, you can't even sing

239
00:28:55,987 --> 00:29:00,604
The lover will carry his bride away

240
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:11,082
The brides people will be left gaping

241
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:16,447
The lover will carry his bride away

242
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:29,295
What are you doing?
Everyone's out there! Let go!

243
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:30,709
On one condition.
- What?

244
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,829
Give me a kiss Senorita.
- Are you crazy?

245
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:39,158
One kiss
- Mamight see!

246
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,269
Let her see

247
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,593
Chutki might see!
- Let her see

248
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:53,962
Aunt might come by.
- Let her come

249
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,515
This Babuji is going to get me killed!

250
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:12,168
What are you wondering Baldev?
There's no countermove

251
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:18,447
First time in20 years, I have you checkmated

252
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:22,896
Good move, indeed.
This once I'm checkmated

253
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:30,838
That's check. And mate.
- Wonderful!

254
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,040
Yes Babuji, I'm wonderful

255
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,701
How did he checkmate?

256
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:40,985
No, I'll put it back.
- No, let me take a look

257
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,714
What happened?

258
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:14,708
You know what's about to happen tomorrow?

259
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:17,868
What?

260
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:23,407
Tomorrow, I'm going to be engaged to Kuljit

261
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:33,546
Tomorrow, Kuljit will put a ring on this finger

262
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:39,951
You know why the engagement
ring is worn on this finger?

263
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:47,103
Because the artery from this
finger leads straight to the heart

264
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:54,422
I can't wear anyone else's ring but yours, Raj

265
00:31:54,423 --> 00:31:57,915
If you want me to walk up in
front of everyone with a ring...

266
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:02,612
and put it on you, I'll do it.
No problem

267
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:05,856
All this is a great joke for you,
isn't it? What I'm going through...

268
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,934
you can never imagine
- Look at me

269
00:32:09,515 --> 00:32:11,969
Look

270
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:17,127
I feel everything Simran, the way
you're pining, your pain, your tears

271
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:22,448
But why don't you understand?
This is just the beginning

272
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:26,440
These people haven't even
gotten to know me properly

273
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:31,099
I need more time, Simran.
And I need your support

274
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:39,497
I want you to smile. And listen,
no son of a gun can take you...

275
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:47,856
You're mine, only mine

276
00:32:56,463 --> 00:33:01,121
Chutki might wake up. Go away

277
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:06,160
Listen

278
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:29,688
Didi...

279
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:33,182
Can I say something?
- Go on

280
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:38,338
I don't like this Kuljit one bit.
Don't marry him

281
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:43,493
It's very late. Go to sleep

282
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:48,526
Didi, I like the one who was on the roof

283
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:57,433
What did you say?

284
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:04,210
Didi, isn't Raj the one you met in Europe?

285
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,858
Yes

286
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:15,264
I like him a lot! You marry him.
- Don't you worry

287
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:20,844
He's the one I'm marrying

288
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:29,194
Yes Grannie?
- Pistachios for the sherbet

289
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:31,231
Done

290
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:34,768
Raj, where are the flowers?
- You put them beside the staircase

291
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:38,260
Oh I forgot! Were it not for you,
everything would be topsy-turvy

292
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,585
That's what I'm saying.
The lover will take his bride away

293
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:46,410
Raj, weren't you with the
grooms people? Have you switched...

294
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,278
over to the brides people?
- Someday I'll have a bride too, no?

295
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:54,436
Just putting in some practice. Get it?
- Never mind. Get lost

296
00:34:54,769 --> 00:35:00,182
Son of a gun

297
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:20,599
Kuljit is so lucky!
- Really

298
00:35:24,793 --> 00:35:30,164
Now give her yours

299
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:34,105
Simran, offer your hand

300
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:39,520
Simran, put your hand out

301
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:45,217
Come on

302
00:35:46,915 --> 00:35:52,245
What's this?

303
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:01,849
Never mind. The other hand

304
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:14,193
"These girls are poison pills"

305
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:19,016
"These boys are rogues"

306
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,839
"Poison pills.
- Rogues"

307
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:40,390
"Make sure you're painted with henna"

308
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:45,761
"Make sure the bride's palanquin is ready"

309
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:52,076
"To take you away, o' beauty,
your lover is coming"

310
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:13,948
"Make sure you come with your face
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

311
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:23,596
"It's a matter of hearts.
Keep it in your heart"

312
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:06,593
"For a signal from your flying tresses..."

313
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:11,126
"with bated breath, the
bachelors await your suit"

314
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,116
"The maidens will go into hiding out of shame..."

315
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:21,023
"for these are all madmen
from town come to our village"

316
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:25,846
"Keep your eyes downcast:
Keep yourself chaste"

317
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:30,836
"Keep your eyes downcast:
Keep yourself chaste"

318
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,872
"To take you away, o' beauty,
your lover is coming"

319
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:19,696
"I'm a young boy: You're a pretty girl"

320
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:24,395
"If our hearts are swayed, what's my crime?"

321
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:29,427
"You should've held your heart.
This beauty is magic"

322
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:34,250
"If the magic is working, what's my crime?"

323
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:39,074
"Keep up for me, leave the door ajar"

324
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:44,064
"Keep up for me, leave the door ajar"

325
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:48,889
"To take you away, o' beauty,
your lover is coming"

326
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:53,712
"Say no more now, do no more now"

327
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:58,785
"Say no more now, do no more now"

328
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:03,608
"It's a matter of hearts.
Keep it in your heart"

329
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:08,598
"Make sure you're painted with henna:
Make sure your palanquin is ready"

330
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:13,423
"Make sure you come with your face
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

331
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:22,117
"O' my precious one..."

332
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:25,486
"O' my precious one... you know not..."

333
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,353
"you're still pretty, and I'm still young"

334
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:37,054
"I could still die for you, my love"

335
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:05,199
"Make sure you're painted with henna:
Make sure your palanquin is ready"

336
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:12,857
"Make sure you come with your face
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

337
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:20,506
Babuji, yesterday you were wonderful!
What a dance! Bested all the others

338
00:43:33,772 --> 00:43:39,932
No Babuji, just a speck of dirt.
Now it’s clean

339
00:43:43,294 --> 00:43:47,660
Too few doves, don't you think?
The whites ones...

340
00:43:50,155 --> 00:43:56,142
Look... one, two, three

341
00:43:56,143 --> 00:44:01,846
No, maybe same like yesterday

342
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:23,047
I've decided. Today I’m talking it over with Raj

343
00:44:23,505 --> 00:44:26,540
Is it something to be ashamed of?
- Raj is here

344
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,283
Back? So early?

345
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:35,023
Raj! My precious son! Come here.
We were just talking of you

346
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:43,174
I've something important to tell you.
- Sure, go on

347
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,871
This ought to be discussed by elders.
But since you're so close to us...

348
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:51,864
I thought, why not talk to you?
- Tell me

349
00:44:51,865 --> 00:44:56,606
I wish this friendship to become a relationship

350
00:44:56,897 --> 00:45:00,888
Why not, why not?
- For my daughter, Preeti...

351
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:07,092
I seek your hand

352
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:11,409
Raj! Better think up something fast!
Else, they have you trussed!

353
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:16,066
Raj, have you any objections?
- What...? Oh no. How could I?

354
00:45:18,353 --> 00:45:20,806
My son!
- But I can't take...

355
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:23,551
such a big decision all by myself.
So you will have to talk to Pops

356
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:26,086
Pops...?
- Father

357
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:29,415
See? What a good boy!
- I never do anything...

358
00:45:30,371 --> 00:45:33,947
against my father's wishes.
- No problem. Give me his number

359
00:45:34,238 --> 00:45:39,609
I'll talk to him over telephone

360
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:46,422
Let ask him to come over.
- No problem

361
00:45:51,537 --> 00:45:56,444
My country, my soil, my Raj!
Here I come, son

362
00:45:59,605 --> 00:46:02,805
Step out of the country,
and you'll find everything...

363
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,466
but the matthri your wife serves up.
- Compliments, lady

364
00:46:06,715 --> 00:46:11,164
Neither the language, nor the culture.
For one who loves the Ganga...

365
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:17,110
what's a Thames? So I told
Raj to return only with his bride

366
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:18,772
That's like it!
- Such conviction

367
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:21,933
What do you do in London?
- Back in London...

368
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:25,594
London...?
- Forget London. All I know is...

369
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:28,794
Go East, go West,
Punjab is the best!

370
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:34,126
Son!

371
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:40,362
Don't you worry. I've got it all tied up

372
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,260
You don't even introduce me to your Daddy

373
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,420
What a wonder! Just this morning,
we were talking about him...

374
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:52,830
and I find him in the marketplace,
armed with a photo, asking about you

375
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:58,487
Whatever anyone says, this marriage
was made in Heaven! Right, lady?

376
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:01,021
Right.
- Right...?

377
00:47:01,022 --> 00:47:04,517
You're strange! You don't need
my permission for a good deed

378
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:07,674
What do you mean no? Have
I ever refused you anything

379
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:10,212
How about sweets?
Your son-in-law’s waiting

380
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:11,874
Right away!
- Go on!

381
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:14,370
The wedding must be done right away!
A good deed can't wait

382
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:17,697
I was thinking of Kuljit and Raj
getting married at the same time

383
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,521
What was that?

384
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:26,181
It's final!
- Raj, are you happy?

385
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:31,504
Give me a sweet! Quick!
My son is happy!

386
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:39,694
Now you're marrying Preeti.
Her brother is Kuljit...

387
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:44,234
the one who's about to marry Simran.
And you love Simran. Not Preeti

388
00:47:46,888 --> 00:47:50,091
What was Preeti doing in London?
- Not Preeti. In London, it was Simran

389
00:47:50,383 --> 00:47:55,579
Yes, Simran... who's this Simran?
- Pops! Just give up thinking! Please

390
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:58,199
Can anything be done
without giving it a thought?

391
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:04,397
I'm here. Everything will be alright.
- By now, it's done already!

392
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:09,551
Wedding must be done right away!
Good deed can't wait! Why did you come?

393
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,781
It was a mistake! Won't happen
again. I'll tell them that I forgot...

394
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:22,401
about your mother's death anniversary.

395
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:27,391
Matter laid to rest for a month

396
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:30,549
May I come in?
- Sure, come right in

397
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,084
You're going to live very long.
Raj and I were just talking of you

398
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,371
Sit

399
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,613
You sit too. Milk for me?
Thank you!

400
00:48:40,614 --> 00:48:44,605
Tomorrow's Karwa Chauth.
- What's Karwa Chauth?

401
00:48:44,606 --> 00:48:47,599
I'd like to keep fast for
Raj's well-being. May I...?

402
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,469
Sure, no problem!
- Karwa Chauth, Pops...?

403
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,795
Karwa Chauth...? No! Never!

404
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:56,873
Why...?
- We consider it a bad omen...

405
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:59,950
for a girl to observe the ritual for
her husband before her marriage

406
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:04,442
Besides my child, we can't
discuss the liaison for a month

407
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:10,187
It was during this month that
Raj's mother passed away

408
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:15,130
We have to fix another date for the
wedding. Let's talk to your father

409
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:19,294
Ajit...

410
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:31,512
Raj, you know what day it is tomorrow?

411
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,333
What's it now?
- My first Karwa Chauth

412
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:42,823
I want you to give me water
and food after my fast

413
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:48,188
Hands off.
- What?

414
00:49:48,189 --> 00:49:52,469
I told you. Hands off

415
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:57,004
Simran, if you don't love me,
just tell me straight. I'll go away

416
00:49:57,543 --> 00:50:01,369
Then you can marry Kuljit. It's going
to save me this everyday melodrama

417
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:05,361
Is it something I said?
- But you never say anything, no?

418
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:10,102
I want you to give me water
and feed me the first morsel...

419
00:50:10,103 --> 00:50:12,679
of food after my fast

420
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,175
Are you out of your mind? You expect
me to make a grand entry saying...

421
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:19,002
"Hi Simran! I'm your husband-to-be!
Here, take a drink of water"

422
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,326
I don't care! I'll even die of hunger!

423
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:24,322
But the first drink of water,
and the first morsel of food...

424
00:50:24,323 --> 00:50:29,654
you will feed me! Get it?

425
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,889
Just like her father

426
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:36,258
So why should I be the butt of the joke?

427
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:44,407
You're unique, Mr. Malhotra.
Your dress doesn't indicate...

428
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:48,399
your affinity to Hindustan.
- The dress has fooled even you?

429
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:54,387
I keep Hindustan in my heart.
- Wonderful!

430
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:59,543
Wonderful...?

431
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:02,914
Ajit was saying you're here to set up a factory?

432
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:06,781
The factory is just an excuse.
If you ask me the truth...

433
00:51:07,072 --> 00:51:10,897
I'm here to choose a bride for Raj

434
00:51:10,898 --> 00:51:14,722
Then men are all out in the outhouse

435
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:17,759
They say, they don't want
to disturb us on Ladies' Day

436
00:51:18,882 --> 00:51:22,415
Are you keeping a fast too?
- Yes

437
00:51:26,034 --> 00:51:30,441
May you live long, my child.
My Kuljit is lucky to get...

438
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:36,437
a bride like you. Come

439
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:39,964
Ma-ji, this is my Pops. Father

440
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:44,620
Your son has cast a spell over everyone here

441
00:51:44,621 --> 00:51:48,445
That's my son

442
00:51:48,446 --> 00:51:53,777
I’ll join you

443
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:57,262
Pops, this is...
- I know

444
00:51:57,263 --> 00:52:02,093
She can only be Simran

445
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:33,988
No one even watches his step.
Hold this. The flowers...!

446
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:41,506
"Let it rain flowers!"

447
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:45,208
"My beloved is here"

448
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:08,003
Kammo, where are the flowers?
Hurry up

449
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:13,527
I'm Raj's father. From London.
- From London...?

450
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:17,227
Actually from Bhatinda. But I've been
in London for many years. You?

451
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:21,717
I'm Simran's Aunt.
- You can't be!

452
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:25,044
What...?
- You could be her sister

453
00:53:25,045 --> 00:53:28,580
Listen... aren't you keeping fast?
- No. I'm still a maiden

454
00:53:31,865 --> 00:53:34,691
Nothing could've been better.
- What...?

455
00:53:34,692 --> 00:53:38,268
One of your flowers.
- Maybe it's for you. Keep it

456
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,725
When is the moon going to rise? I'm starving

457
00:53:59,726 --> 00:54:05,263
I hope it kills you.
Did I ask you to fast?

458
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:12,199
Eat this on the sly.
No one's looking

459
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,730
Don't

460
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:19,851
The moon is up.
- Where?

461
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:24,184
There

462
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:57,817
"On this night of prayer for the wedded woman..."

463
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:06,010
"I look at the moon, I pray with folded hands"

464
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:10,667
"Then I break my fast"

465
00:55:13,952 --> 00:55:18,651
"Give me the water, take
your slave for your queen"

466
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:23,516
"Tonight, give me what I desire"

467
00:55:25,014 --> 00:55:28,880
"Come home o' wanderer,
your beloved beckons"

468
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:46,178
What happened?
- Water

469
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:48,590
Simi, my child
- Drink water

470
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:52,666
What happened? What happened to her?
- She swooned

471
00:55:54,828 --> 00:55:59,859
Get up. Come, my child

472
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:05,389
What happened?
- It's all right. She just swooned

473
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:10,546
It's nothing. Come on, let's eat

474
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:15,203
She's so fragile, no?

475
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:18,032
Why are you anxious?
Are you fasting too?

476
00:56:18,033 --> 00:56:21,524
No...
- Then come along

477
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:28,552
It isn't easy for him to get away.
Everyone's asking for Raj all the time

478
00:56:29,592 --> 00:56:32,711
He won't be able to come, Didi.
Please, eat something

479
00:56:33,084 --> 00:56:38,741
I won't! I'd rather die starving.
- Very well, kill yourself

480
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:52,754
I'm sorry, I'm late. But what to do?
They weren't about to leave me

481
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:56,247
It was tough getting away.
Here, eat

482
00:56:57,203 --> 00:57:01,111
Eat it

483
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:05,478
I said I'm sorry. Now eat.
Else, you'll swoon for real

484
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:14,127
Chutki, tell him there’s no
need for him to worry for me

485
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:21,280
I was about to faint of hunger.
And there he was, filling his stomach

486
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:26,770
Anyway, it's my first Karwa Chauth.
Why should he get so worked up?

487
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:29,596
Whether I live or die, is he bothered?

488
00:57:29,597 --> 00:57:34,004
You don't know this. But Raj hasn't
eaten anything all day either

489
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:39,286
He wanted to break fast with you.
And he told me not to tell you

490
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:45,780
Sorry Raj, but I couldn't keep shut any longer

491
00:57:52,966 --> 00:57:55,460
Come here

492
00:57:55,461 --> 00:58:01,332
Talking to me?
- Come here

493
00:58:16,003 --> 00:58:19,205
I got carried away.
- No matter, Senorita

494
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:25,367
In big places, such small things happen

495
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:33,850
My turn Senorita. Feed me

496
00:58:52,888 --> 00:58:56,921
I told you, not to betray my trust.
Simran hasn't forgotten him yet?

497
00:58:57,712 --> 00:59:03,250
If she remembers, she'll regret it

498
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:06,360
What happened to me won't
happen to my daughter

499
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:10,270
No more sacrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife

500
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:14,720
She'll live life as she wishes.
She'll have her share of happiness

501
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:25,704
Come in

502
00:59:48,402 --> 00:59:50,439
Keep this

503
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,640
Ma, this...?
- Not a word! I know everything

504
00:59:56,594 --> 01:00:01,793
I've seen everything. Raj is the
one you met in Europe. I know

505
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:06,615
I also know, the two of
you love each other dearly

506
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:11,481
I was wrong Simran! My daughter
won't sacrifice her happiness

507
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:18,100
She isn't going to sacrifice her love

508
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:24,954
I know Raj, you'll make my daughter
very happy. You have my blessings

509
01:00:26,118 --> 01:00:29,860
Take my daughter away.
Leave

510
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:34,851
No one here cares for your love.
Take her away from here

511
01:00:36,472 --> 01:00:39,133
I’ll take care of everything.
- No Ma-ji

512
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:43,002
I don't want to hear anything! No!
Please go away from here!

513
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:52,482
I beg of you, son!
- I will Ma-ji. I’ll take her away

514
01:00:55,143 --> 01:00:58,844
Come... sit here

515
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:06,835
Keep this

516
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,529
Ma-ji, I was a little boy when
my mother passed away

517
01:01:12,525 --> 01:01:16,350
But whatever I am today, is because of her

518
01:01:16,351 --> 01:01:20,842
To this day I haven't forgotten
something she said. She'd say...

519
01:01:22,173 --> 01:01:28,036
"Son, at every turn in life, you'll
find two roads. One right, one wrong"

520
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:35,022
"The wrong route will be easy, it
will draw you. But the right path..."

521
01:01:35,313 --> 01:01:40,385
"will be hard, with lots of
hazards, a lot many troubles"

522
01:01:40,386 --> 01:01:46,249
"On the wrong road, initially, you
might find success, happiness"

523
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:53,734
"But in the end, you will lose.
Upon the right path, initially..."

524
01:01:55,523 --> 01:02:00,430
"you may trip at every step, you
may face hazards, difficulties."

525
01:02:02,426 --> 01:02:06,043
But... in the end, you will always win"

526
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:16,938
Now you tell me, Ma-ji. Am I
on the right, or in the wrong?

527
01:02:21,388 --> 01:02:27,417
Your way is absolutely right, son.
But you don't know my husband

528
01:02:30,036 --> 01:02:34,111
And Ma-ji, your husband doesn't know me

529
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:39,808
If I wanted to elope with Simran,
I could've done it already

530
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:46,960
But I want to be given Simran.
I don't want to steal her

531
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:52,284
I don't want to take her away
on the sly. I want to do it openly

532
01:02:54,447 --> 01:02:58,439
If I have come, I'll surely carry my bride away

533
01:03:00,101 --> 01:03:06,796
But only when Babuji gives me
her hand, of his own volition

534
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:13,449
Now Simran isn't your problem.
She's my headache

535
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:17,483
As for you, you have given your daughter away

536
01:03:17,484 --> 01:03:20,851
Just a matter of time now
before the bride is carried away

537
01:03:34,283 --> 01:03:37,652
Is this crying illness in the genes?

538
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,525
How strange Uncle-ji! Tell me.
- The girl... what's her name...?

539
01:03:59,856 --> 01:04:03,517
Yes Simran. I don't approve of the match

540
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:07,840
Why Uncle-ji?
- Girl's fine. But no match for you

541
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:15,368
You're a strong young Jatt d'Punjab!
And this girl is frail, subdued

542
01:04:15,658 --> 01:04:20,688
Is this any match? Match for
you is a girl like a sparkler!

543
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:23,725
Just come with me to London.
The girls I'll introduce you to...

544
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:29,429
will drive you crazy!

545
01:04:32,707 --> 01:04:36,243
And we’re going to be in London,
meeting your sparklers!

546
01:04:41,525 --> 01:04:45,225
Pull out all the stops!
- You son of a gun

547
01:04:52,378 --> 01:04:59,405
As a little boy, I'd ride out to the
fields on my father's shoulders

548
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:06,433
Ever since, I struck up a friendship
with these doves. I find it...

549
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,548
so peaceful out here.

550
01:05:09,549 --> 01:05:14,083
I love spending time with the doves

551
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:22,940
Tell me Babuji, are the doves here
different from the doves in London?

552
01:05:29,262 --> 01:05:34,169
Difference there is. The doves
here know me, they recognize me

553
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:39,449
They belong to my land.
Even the doves out there are alien

554
01:05:40,946 --> 01:05:48,307
Could it be that you perceive it
differently? Maybe a dove out there...

555
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:55,293
took to wings from here, from
your land... one who knows you...

556
01:05:56,622 --> 01:06:01,487
one who recognizes you.
Maybe you don't recognize him?

557
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:17,172
What happened?

558
01:06:17,455 --> 01:06:20,991
What are you doing?
- My Ma used to say...

559
01:06:21,447 --> 01:06:24,816
the soil of our land is very
powerful. It's going to be fine

560
01:06:26,106 --> 01:06:31,686
But this is outrageous!
Who might've done this?

561
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:39,169
Babuji, look

562
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:48,684
Let's go.
- Babuji...

563
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:53,674
Are you still angry about my beer act?

564
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:58,998
I was childish.
Won't you forgive me?

565
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:02,199
I forgot that long ago

566
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:06,192
I was wrong about you.
You're right

567
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:13,261
I didn't recognize.
Come, let's go

568
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:27,398
Ma-ji, what is the matter?
You asked for me?

569
01:07:28,855 --> 01:07:32,388
Son, whatever the doctor might say,

570
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:37,879
I know my time's up

571
01:07:38,252 --> 01:07:41,704
Speak of nice things, Ma-ji.
What a thing to say?

572
01:07:42,577 --> 01:07:46,444
Not to be anxious. I'm of
the age when one leaves

573
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:53,430
I've had a wonderful life.

574
01:07:55,551 --> 01:08:00,042
Son, I have nothing to complain about

575
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:03,410
But now that I see Simran...

576
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:08,942
after years a desire wells up in my heart.

577
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:17,132
I want to see Simran married

578
01:08:17,133 --> 01:08:23,620
Before she marries, I wish I don't...
- How can you talk of such things?

579
01:08:25,616 --> 01:08:28,609
Listen son

580
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,769
The bride's palanquin has just got to
cross over from one house to another

581
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:38,465
Now that everyone is here, what
difference would it make if...

582
01:08:39,421 --> 01:08:45,160
the wedding is pre-punned to tomorrow?
- Absolutely correct!

583
01:08:45,618 --> 01:08:49,276
The wedding happens tomorrow.
Yes Baldev? Right tomorrow

584
01:08:49,277 --> 01:08:54,690
Yes Ma-ji. Tomorrow

585
01:09:01,794 --> 01:09:06,117
We will have to take Simran away on the sly

586
01:09:06,118 --> 01:09:10,485
Nothing else is going to work.
Don't worry. I have it all worked out

587
01:09:11,274 --> 01:09:15,516
We're taking the morning train
out. I’ll wait for you at the station

588
01:09:15,725 --> 01:09:18,426
Somehow or the other,
just get there with Simran

589
01:09:18,427 --> 01:09:21,670
Whatever happens next, we'll see

590
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:24,872
Are you listening?

591
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:28,532
I know this isn't your way. You don't
want to take Simran away like this

592
01:09:29,363 --> 01:09:33,022
But son, it's too late now. If you love her...

593
01:09:33,272 --> 01:09:38,345
if you want to spend a lifetime with
her, you must elope. Understand?

594
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,987
Please Raj, take me away from here!
You don't know my Babuji!

595
01:09:51,652 --> 01:09:57,141
We have to run from here. We must!
- I've come to take you as my bride.

596
01:09:57,807 --> 01:10:02,506
I’ll take you only when your
Babuji gives me your hand

597
01:10:03,628 --> 01:10:09,166
What is to happen tomorrow, I don't know

598
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:13,816
What I'm going to do tomorrow, I don't know

599
01:10:18,265 --> 01:10:23,845
But you must trust me

600
01:10:24,794 --> 01:10:31,197
Whatever I do tomorrow,
is going to be for both of us

601
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:41,676
Do you love me?

602
01:10:41,677 --> 01:10:46,499
Do you trust me?

603
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:51,990
Then it's just a matter of time before
the bride is carried away, no?

604
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:06,884
"Oh heart's love"

605
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:10,577
"Oh my love"

606
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:23,559
"I give you..."

607
01:11:24,175 --> 01:11:27,918
"to God to keep"

608
01:11:48,086 --> 01:11:50,580
"So strange are the ways of the world"

609
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:53,740
"The heart is crazed, yet so helpless"

610
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:56,401
"What's left to be heard?
What's left to be said?"

611
01:11:56,402 --> 01:12:02,065
"Just let it lie between us"

612
01:12:03,597 --> 01:12:08,587
"The hide-n-seek is over. I'm getting married"

613
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:18,483
"Howl wish it doesn't kill you"

614
01:12:20,604 --> 01:12:23,973
Simi, come down, quick! Time for
the ritual body-painting with henna

615
01:12:38,443 --> 01:12:43,640
"Oh my love"

616
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:48,130
"Oh my Moon"

617
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:51,666
"You are my life..."

618
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:56,157
"my beloved"

619
01:13:56,453 --> 01:14:00,238
I wanted to tell you

620
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:08,721
You were right. I failed to recognize

621
01:14:11,341 --> 01:14:15,749
You enter my house, and before my family...

622
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:21,402
you play with my honor?

623
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:25,271
You have deceived me! You have
taken advantage of our trust!

624
01:14:26,602 --> 01:14:30,925
You made a joke out of our cordiality?

625
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:34,085
How dare you have an affair with Simran?

626
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:38,161
Did you imagine you'd marry Simran?
You aren't even worthy of yourself

627
01:14:38,162 --> 01:14:41,404
How can you be worthy of Simran?

628
01:14:41,405 --> 01:14:46,271
I was right about you.
Liars, wastrels like you never improve

629
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,887
They only become worse

630
01:14:49,888 --> 01:14:53,132
No Babuji! No!

631
01:15:01,615 --> 01:15:06,978
Didn't I tell you to take me away?
No one cares for our love!

632
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:11,761
Didn't I say, let's elope?
- No Simran, don't

633
01:15:13,757 --> 01:15:17,582
You can only run from strangers

634
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:23,287
From the ones we call our own
Our elders are our parents

635
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:41,161
All our lives, they've brought us up.
They gave us so much love

636
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:49,435
About our lives, they can
decide better than we can

637
01:15:49,436 --> 01:15:54,675
We have no right to make them
sad for the sake of our happiness

638
01:16:01,495 --> 01:16:08,522
Babuji is right. I am a liar, a cheat

639
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:19,376
Even if I lied for your sake, a lie is always a lie

640
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:29,653
Babuji is right. I'm not worthy of you

641
01:16:32,682 --> 01:16:36,217
And so what if I can see nothing beyond you?

642
01:16:38,878 --> 01:16:42,413
And so what if I can remember no one but you?

643
01:16:45,365 --> 01:16:48,734
Babuji is right. I'm a wastrel.

644
01:16:51,686 --> 01:16:57,506
How did I think of marrying you?

645
01:16:57,507 --> 01:17:00,752
So what if this wastrel loves you like a madman?

646
01:17:11,105 --> 01:17:16,269
Love isn't everything, is it?

647
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:20,918
Babuji is right, Simran

648
01:17:20,919 --> 01:17:25,417
Babuji is right

649
01:17:29,735 --> 01:17:33,935
Here you are Babuji.
Take your daughter

650
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:53,603
I didn't come here to break anyone's heart

651
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:58,975
I just wanted to win hearts

652
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,920
Maybe I fall short of expectations

653
01:18:01,921 --> 01:18:07,291
Maybe that's why I couldn't win you over

654
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,110
If you think Kuljit will make
Simran happier...

655
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:20,632
then you're right.

656
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:24,999
What's best for Simran, you know best

657
01:18:29,947 --> 01:18:35,984
Forgive me

658
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:35,190
Forgive me Preeti

659
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:40,729
I know I have hurt you

660
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:36,941
Where's Simran, Raj?
Raj, where is Simran?

661
01:20:36,942 --> 01:20:40,145
She will come, Pops.
She'll come

662
01:20:42,764 --> 01:20:45,592
Babuji will bring her. Personally

663
01:20:45,593 --> 01:20:50,965
He will have to

664
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:16,156
I wish to hear no more.
Go away from here

665
01:21:17,113 --> 01:21:20,980
Your son has deceived all of us.
He has shown us where he belongs

666
01:21:21,936 --> 01:21:27,974
I won't let my daughter marry a liar!
- Enough!

667
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:32,333
I am proud of my son.
Don't incite me to passion

668
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,338
Kuljit and Raj are fighting at the station

669
01:22:52,339 --> 01:22:55,581
We must go there!
One might kill the other!

670
01:22:56,248 --> 01:23:01,578
Come on

671
01:23:06,684 --> 01:23:12,139
Come with me Simran

672
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:06,655
Stop

673
01:25:40,752 --> 01:25:47,079
Let me go, Babuji!
Please let me go

674
01:25:47,571 --> 01:25:50,732
Raj means all my life!
Without him, I can't live

675
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:54,723
Let me go to my Raj

676
01:25:54,724 --> 01:26:00,760
Please let me go to my Raj

677
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:22,749
Go Simran

678
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:26,950
No one can love you more than him

679
01:26:29,154 --> 01:26:32,606
Go my child. Go to your Raj

680
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:40,513
Go on Simran.
Live your life

681
01:27:41,176 --> 01:27:44,254
In big places, such small things happen

682
01:27:48,204 --> 01:27:52,737
The lover will carry his bride away

683
01:27:53,456 --> 01:29:20,765
