00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,034
I don't know what I was thinking

10
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:42,930
maybe I wasn't thinking?

11
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,333
Maybe thoughts
just went out of my mind

12
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,701
I can't believe this!

13
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,941
Why is this happening to me?

14
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,116
- Number 35
- Yes

15
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,916

- Yes

16
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,615
- Number 37
- Yes

17
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:06,816
You guys are up next

18
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,823
Miss, what number are you?

19
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,623
- I'm 34, Jang Mi-young
- Jang Mi-young?

20
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,236
You missed it
You'll have to wait

21
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,340
What do you mean
I missed it?

22
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,532
Sit down and wait

23
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,734
I had a call from nature

24
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,937
Wait till you're called

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,547
I can't afford to wait

26
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,343
Look, lady
This isn't your playground!

27
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,451
Please, let me go in

28
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,849
I won't be long

29
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,353
- I must go in
- Go sit down

30
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,047
Go!

31
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,451
You can leave now

32
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,152
Those that I've called go in

33
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,764
and sit to the left

34
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,062
Relax and do your thing

35
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,362
Next!

36
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,267
Excuse me!
I'm 34, Jang Mi-young

37
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,877
I had to go to

38
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,876
Sorry

39
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,278
Hold on!
Give me a sec

40
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,982
I had diarrhea so I had
to use the ladies' room

41
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,485
I couldn't help it

42
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,782
I'm just saying

43
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,084
Please, give me a chance

44
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,487
Let go!

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:37,506
You took my man

46
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,412
How dare you

47
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,816
How dare you

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,327
You took my

49
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,425
Sorry, but

50
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:58,626
Can I do this later?

51
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:09,106
The Greatest Expectation

52
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,357
Let's go, number 3!

53
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,966
I'm hungry

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,968
You had a hotdog earlier

55
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,766
I'm still hungry

56
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,769
Are we buying all these?

57
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:40,970
Do you have money?

58
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,176
Do I?

59
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,675
We're putting them back later

60
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,479
Why?

61
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,088
It's just what you do here

62
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,902
Too much meat isn't good
for your system

63
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,897
Dumplings!

64
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,213
Remember it's called a buffet

65
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,908
Wasn't it fun today?

66
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,520
We saw lots of animals,
didn't we?

67
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,713
Tell Jang-mi so, okay?

68
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,428
Your grandma's not home

69
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,826
Don't forget the word,
'buffet'

70
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,333
- Say it for me
- Buffet

71
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,132
Tell Jang-mi we ate
at a buffet, okay?

72
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,634
Grandma

73
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,234
You scared me

74
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,642
What was that for?

75
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,338
Bastard!

76
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,441
Where on earth
have you been, son?

77
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:57,852
Grandma,
I'm not your son

78
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,051
What's this then?

79
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,959
Tits?
No, it's a penis!

80
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,658
He's the seed you planted
So take care of him!

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,462
Okay, okay!

82
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,674
Grandma, I'm thirsty

83
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,675
Are you, my pumpkin?

84
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,678
Come on, I'll get you
some water

85
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,208
- Where are you going?
- To make money!

86
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,892
It's changed

87
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,913
Mom?
What are you doing?

88
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:09,221
It's so upsetting!
I can't believe this

89
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,434
Don't you wanna know
how the audition went?

90
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,437
I know you failed it again

91
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,735
You sure you're my mom?

92
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,242
I found you under a bridge

93
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,939
No!

94
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:33,142
This is so frustrating!

95
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,551
I never win
Shitty game

96
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,156
- Can't stand it anymore
- Where are you going?

97
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,155
Playing cards again?

98
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,261
I need to practice
in real life

99
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,659
I'm starving!

100
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,255
Collect the late fees and
order some Chinese

101
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,461
You're so young
You don't even have a man?

102
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,768
Always coming home for meals

103
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,677
Hey, wanna play cards?

104
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,280
Look who's here

105
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,287
Shoes!
Where the hell did you go?

106
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,055
What?

107
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,789
I was at Jang-mi's

108
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,989
Jang-mi's busy with work
So I baby-sat the boy

109
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,997
Some cartoonist she is!

110
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,900
She made a bum
do her volunteer work?

111
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,701
Okay, that's fine

112
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,600
What's this?

113
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,907
'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'

114
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,416
Why haven't you returned it?

115
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,315
I was going to

116
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,821
Don't watch videos or eat
unless you make money

117
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,525
Did you think I'd flee the country
over this lousy video?

118
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,531
Why the hell did you call?

119
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,932
My mom told me to

120
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,632
Better be nice
to your biggest patron

121
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,541
The late fee comes to 1,500 won

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,849
Tajja 2' is still out?

123
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,245
Who the hell rented it?

124
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,344
'Tajja 2'?
He should here soon

125
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,659
Here comes your meal!

126
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,555
Did you bring it?

127
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,561
Sure did! I didn't come
empty-handed

128
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,666
That'll be $3.50

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,563
I meant 'Tajja 2'

130
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,262
Oh, that!

131
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,738
Darn, I forgot again
I'm so stupid

132
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,073
It's him?
He rented 'Tajja 2'?

133
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,577
Mr... Chinese Food

134
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,675
Don't you have any etiquette?
Return what you rent on time

135
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,380
Who's this wise ass?

136
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,582
I know you're all busy
but it's been a week

137
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,684
What do you care?

138
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:02,063
You don't pay my late fees

139
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,864
Do you have any idea

140
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:11,272
what emotional trauma
others go through

141
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,176
waiting on that book?

142
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,681
I've had to endure the pain
of waiting for that book!

143
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,878
What are you babbling on about?

144
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,387
Read Part 3 first then
That's what it's there for

145
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,890
The story doesn't connect!

146
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,394
You reconnect it then

147
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,695
You corn-headed asshole!
What are you gonna do about it?

148
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,396
Please, return it ASAP

149
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,199
What the hell!

150
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,901
Did I stain it
with noodle soup?

151
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,104
Did I tear off a section
and wipe my ass?

152
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,010
Who says deliverymen
shouldn't read the funnies!

153
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,915
Should I just fucking
deliver all day!

154
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,321
Can't a girl eat in peace!

155
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,421
What was that?

156
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,518
Leave it,
or take it outside

157
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,723
Even with a mouthful,
you're still so pretty

158
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,837
Not so fast, wise guy

159
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:16,237
Finish what you started
Come on, make my day

160
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,343
What's your problem?

161
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,644
Return it soon, please

162
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,749
Or what?

163
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,849
You'll pay late fees

164
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,351
Stupid asshole

165
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,857
Hey, pay your late fees!

166
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,050
Change the part
in your hair!

167
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,751
Leave!

168
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,863
Shit!

169
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,065
He eats like a pig, man

170
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,366
Took him to a buffet

171
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,065
He cleaned out every dish
in the restaurant

172
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,377
Time to pay out, girl
I'm hungry

173
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,385
Eat this

174
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,180
Wait till I get paid for this

175
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,080
I don't understand

176
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,891
Why are you helping
the less fortunate?

177
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,496
Nobody's worse-off
than you

178
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,495
No crumbs, okay?

179
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,394
I'm working here
and you're watching TV?

180
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,596
Losing your focus?

181
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,503
What? The breath of a man
distracts you?

182
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,972
Wanna get laid?

183
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,516
You took my man

184
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,851
How dare you

185
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,526
I'm gonna kill you

186
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,931
I'm gonna kill you

187
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,296
- Aaaaah!
- What are you doing?

188
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,729
You scared me!

189
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,137
- Dinner?
- I ate!

190
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,742
No, for me?

191
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,538
What am I, your maid or something?

192
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,647
You're a bum
You should've cooked

193
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,342
It's on the table
Go stuff yourself

194
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,945
Wasn't I scared!

195
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,986
Mi-young, you're dead!

196
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,487
You wore my clothes again!

197
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,286
No, I never wore that leopard panties

198
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,484
So stupid!

199
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,789
How'd you know
I was talking about it then?

200
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,488
Stupid idiot!

201
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,395
I just tried it on

202
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,798
It's all stretched out!

203
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:24,800
I told you a hundred times

204
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,404
Your ass is way too big!

205
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,302
Maybe it was made loose

206
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,101
God!

207
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,508
Go get me
a pack of cigarettes

208
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,808
You go get it!

209
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,611
Don't want the change?

210
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,613
You smoke 'Time', right?

211
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,739
Shit!

212
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,846
What's the point?
You're dying soon anyway

213
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,355
God damn it!

214
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,094
Hey, you!

215
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,634
What?

216
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,469
I'm missing a dime

217
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,808
So?

218
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,537
It was $1.40,
but now it's only $1.30

219
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,204
So what?

220
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,675
- Give me a dime
- Why should I?

221
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,479
You bumped into me

222
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,282
You weren't looking
where you were going

223
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,980
I was

224
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,991
That old man in red

225
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,393
Don't be a tightwad
Give me a dime

226
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,998
Why should I?

227
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,794
You're not going home
until you find it

228
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,405
Or give me a dime

229
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,507
so I can buy my cigarettes

230
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,304
You choose!

231
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,604
My legs hurt

232
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,612
What a freaking girl!

233
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,911
What?

234
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,714
What's your problem?

235
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,515
Please, spare me a dime

236
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,624
I'm begging you

237
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,420
I need it to buy cigarettes

238
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
I'll take it
off your late fees

239
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,828
What does that have
to do with this?

240
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,334
Making me crazy

241
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:42,033
Why should I give you
any money?

242
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,074
What took you so long?

243
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,947
Shut up

244
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,653
That bitch!

245
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,956
Hey, why is this open?

246
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,628
Merciless bitch

247
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,231
Merciless bitch

248
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,798
That merciless bitch

249
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,102
Merciless bitch

250
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,671
I can't believe that bitch

251
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,901
Brother?

252
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,804
I'm home

253
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,211
Oh, hey

254
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,346
I'm hitting the sack

255
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,719
- He's going to bed
- Get off of me

256
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,224
Come on, we can't stop now

257
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,828
I said, get off

258
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,524
Damn it!

259
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,226
I've got a fucking demon
for a brother

260
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,229
Twenty years of age

261
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,634
M&A

262
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,240
The revolutionary movement
that was in Czech?

263
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,436
Prague Spring

264
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,884
Fucking stocks!

265
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,224
How can she not know that?

266
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,562
Independence Editorial

267
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,662
Ojak Bridge

268
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,069
Spinoza

269
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,405
Hi

270
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,545
Hi

271
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,749
Fuck me!

272
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,122
You don't have a penny
In that account

273
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,853
Right, what a stupid thing to do

274
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,324
Maybe I should
go to your wife

275
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,596
Wait outside

276
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,404
I helped you make money

277
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,910
Give me ten more

278
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,607
- $10 my ass! Ten? Ten? Ten!
- Fuck!

279
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,114
I'm still down $8 Gs, man

280
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,912
You don't have any right
to ask for anything!

281
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,419
Don't hit me on the head! Fuck!

282
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,715
It'll bounce back

283
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,519
If she finds out that
I touched that account

284
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,526
I'm as good as dead
So, stop bullshitting me

285
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,722
- Keep your mouth shut
- I got sources telling me

286
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,334
When a flying saucer
lands at the airport?

287
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,835
Don't be such a wuss
You gotta look ahead

288
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,734
No wonder dad always

289
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,637
- beating the crap out of you
- Shut up!

290
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,441
For 12 bra and panty pairs

291
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,739
it's only $39.80

292
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,146
What an incredible price!

293
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,649
And we give you

294
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:17,346
a sexy ivory nightgown for free

295
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,150
On our last broadcast

296
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,553
I was so tempted

297
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,354
So I bought my sister
this set of lingerie

298
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,692
Let me tell you
She absolutely loved it

299
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,795
That lying bitch!

300
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,273
When'd you get me any
freaking panties?

301
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,274
You're so two-faced

302
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,172
Go!

303
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,079
Come on, decide your move

304
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,787
That!

305
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,782
Lose that one

306
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,789
Shut up
He might take it

307
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,690
Trust me on this

308
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,490
If he takes it,
he gets more points

309
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,893
I bet he doesn't have it
Do as I say

310
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,196
You sure?
He doesn't have this?

311
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,394
- Shall I?
- Of course

312
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,300
- Maybe you're right
- Yes, of course!

313
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,406
Trust me
Go ahead

314
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,400
So stupid

315
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,540
Why is that my fault?

316
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,785
- Shut up!
- Why are you hitting me?

317
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,980
Stop hitting me!

318
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,683
I've had it! Don't expect
to see me again!

319
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,730
What are you doing here?

320
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,026
Reading the funnies

321
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,227
You have a lot at your shop

322
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,635
Why pay to read them here?

323
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:45,038
You can't always eat at home
Sometimes you eat out, right?

324
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,644
Leave me alone

325
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,747
Don't get fresh with me, girl

326
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,492
Jang-mi!

327
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,754
Why is the door locked?

328
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,262
Eating pork, or something?

329
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,880
We're out of lettuce

330
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,778
Why aren't you eating?

331
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,119
Help yourself

332
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,048
I couldn't care less
if they starved to death

333
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,244
I will love you

334
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,815
- until the end of time...
- One two, one two

335
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,469
God, I peed on myself

336
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,773
Why does that old fart
jog at night?

337
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,179
What's wrong with him!
Man

338
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,399
- Damn!
- Let's go!

339
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,162
We're fucked, man
Let's get out of here

340
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,271
Come on, Drive!
God damn it!

341
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,845
They're taking him
to the hospital, right?

342
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,853
I guess so
They know we saw it

343
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,356
You got the plate?

344
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,858
- What?
- The plate number?

345
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,591
Yeah

346
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,177
Fuck!

347
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,674
Fuck! Is he dead?

348
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,874
Heaven doesn't help those
who helped themselves

349
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,348
Nothing in life works
in my favor

350
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,421
Should we bury him?

351
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,858
- Bury what?
- No, we shouldn't

352
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,657
We'll get life for that

353
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,929
That's too long, isn't it?

354
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,625
Way too long

355
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,297
Why the fuck now?

356
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,203
This is a bad sign

357
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,175
What do you have
for eyes?

358
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,972
Marbles, asshole!

359
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,277
What boss Drives himself?

360
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,782
I gave that money to you

361
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,082
to get a fucking
driver's license!

362
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,281
And you drank it away!

363
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,098
- You're doing it!
- No way!

364
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,393
What makes you think
I can teach?

365
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,404
Why the hell not?

366
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,106
You didn't go to college
to be a bum, did you?

367
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,506
She's right

368
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,704
A bum with a degree?
That's too much

369
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,213
It's been 2 years

370
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,409
You can't freeload off of us
forever

371
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,817
Yeah, that's too much

372
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:51,923
Hush!

373
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,924
Maybe I should get married
and move out of here

374
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,721
Dream on

375
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,729
What girl wants to marry
a piece of shit like you?

376
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:03,130
She must be mentally ill

377
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,035
Zip it!

378
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,935
Decide now

379
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,634
Will you teach, or move out?

380
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,041
Show some respect
I'm your brother-in-law

381
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,944
- Look, Mister
- What?

382
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:22,452
Earn some respect
Then I'll be nice to you

383
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,948
Where are you going?

384
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,754
Get off my back!

385
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:34,764
Stop it before I Drown
myself in the river

386
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,164
You get fined for dumping
garbage in the river

387
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,362
Yeah, no garbage dumping
in the river

388
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,472
- That expensive?
- One Go!

389
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,674
No, let me think about it

390
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,684
- I was on the phone
- What was that?

391
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,379
A herbal diet program

392
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,287
Why don't I beat you up
to lose some weight?

393
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,586
Herbal dietso ridiculous

394
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,287
My ass is huge
What about my thighs?

395
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,566
Actresses nowadays are
all toothpicks

396
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,500
You should take a look at one of them

397
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:13,593
I saw this actress
the other day

398
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,298
She was so skinny

399
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,409
I thought she was dying

400
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,742
She looked like this
You like that?

401
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,749
That's in lately
Looking as fragile as a willow

402
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,854
Willow my ass

403
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,148
Keep playing cards

404
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,757
I'm so hating you, mom

405
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,860
I'm not your mom

406
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,760
I told you I found you
under a bridge

407
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,959
- Stop distracting me
- Some mom you are!

408
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,566
Two Go!

409
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,977
One more Go, and I win!

410
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,978
It's so unfair

411
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,775
You have a big mouth

412
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,077
So does my sister

413
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,482
But look at me!

414
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,885
I have a hard time
getting a hotdog in

415
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,184
Come here
I'll rip it open wider

416
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,187
When I get some money,
I'll have a DNA test done

417
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,196
It'd be a waste of money

418
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,800
Where are you going?

419
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,403
To find my biological mom!

420
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,368
Three Go!

421
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,516
Wanted: Eyewitnesses
Reward: $5,000

422
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,921
Yeah, I saw everything

423
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:46,827
Now? Where?
Yeah, I know that place

424
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:51,832
I was wondering...
Did anybody else call?

425
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,035
Because this girl

426
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:58,734
Oh, I see
Sure, I'll be there

427
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,346
Five thousand dollars!

428
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,660
Excuse me
You called, didn't you?

429
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,302
I'm so glad he's okay

430
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,170
He got hit pretty hard

431
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,540
He's healthy, isn't he?
I know he jogs every night

432
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,440
Right

433
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,073
Going to the police?

434
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,753
Yes, by the way,
did you see the plate?

435
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,153
Of course!
I saw everything

436
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,884
The plate, make and
model of the car

437
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,515
- Get in
- Okay

438
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,153
Thank God I witnessed it

439
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,790
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
able to nail those bastards

440
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,694
Oh, you have company
Should I sit in the back?

441
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,135
Sure

442
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:15,613
Hey, wake up

443
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,917
- Hey!
- Who the fuck are you?

444
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,652
It's me The video girl

445
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:26,596
From the video store?
What are you doing here?

446
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,090
In the trunk of their car

447
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,101
I came for the reward and
ended up in here like you

448
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,898
You mean that

449
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,506
They put up that sign?

450
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,666
I think so

451
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,243
Mannothing good left in this world

452
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,579
What'd they hit me with?
It hurts like hell

453
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:45,948
Shut up and
let's untie ourselves

454
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,416
Turn around

455
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,954
- What for?
- Turn around!

456
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,886
Oh, our hands are tied

457
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,161
Don't pretend to be
so sensitive

458
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,273
Let me untie you first

459
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,470
Done?

460
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,014
What are you doing?
Untie me now

461
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:25,052
Hold on
Let me catch my breath

462
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,771
What are you doing?

463
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,068
What shampoo do you use?

464
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,010
Stop fooling around
Untie me now

465
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:55,881
This is important for me
What do you use?

466
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,787
What are you, a pervert?
It's 'Dove'

467
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:05,487
'Dove'?
I thought so

468
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:12,201
Don't move
Stop wiggling

469
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,498
- Come on!
- Stay put

470
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,334
Okay, hold on

471
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,173
Okay, done

472
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,513
God, he's slow

473
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,621
What?

474
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,625
What are you doing?

475
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:42,927
It's too dark in here
We need to find a weapon

476
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,337
It uses up the oxygen

477
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,339
Give me a break
We're not in a coal mine

478
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,341
I need to fix my makeup

479
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,908
What a girl!

480
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,282
What are you doing?

481
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,955
Pop the trunk!

482
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,136
Can't even do that?

483
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,603
You go

484
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,737
I told you to go

485
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,373
- Move aside
- Don't hit me!

486
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,438
- You're so useless, It's right here!
- Where?

487
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,110
Can't even do this?

488
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,683
- Please, don't kill us
- Don't kill us

489
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,293
Move your arm

490
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,793
- Roll it down
- Okay

491
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,693
Don't kill us
Let us go!

492
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:59,069
Stop right there!
Go get them!

493
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:12,347
So the hit-and-run Driver
tried to kidnap you?

494
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,857
You don't get it, do you?

495
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,963
It wasn'tjust an
attempted kidnapping

496
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,156
They tried to kill us!

497
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,666
- Plate number?
- Give it to him

498
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:29,171
What?
The plate number is

499
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:35,868
- I don't quite...
- You forgot the number?

500
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,982
How could you!

501
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,084
It was too dark to see it!

502
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,585
You told me you got it
when I asked you

503
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,279
Stop yelling at me!

504
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,984
Quiet, both of you!

505
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,321
So

506
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,594
You witnessed a hit-and-run

507
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,733
and almost got kidnapped

508
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,268
But neither of you remembers
the plate number?

509
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:02,464
How do you expect me
to bust these guys?

510
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,537
At least

511
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:10,875
Give me the city
it's registered to

512
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,277
Seoul!

513
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,048
And it's a 'Potentia'
Yeah, that's it!

514
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,552
Potentia! Potentia!

515
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:22,217
What about you, Miss?

516
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,385
- 38!
- What's that?

517
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,090
- Last two digits of the plate
- You sure?

518
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,996
I'd bet my big ass on it

519
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,955
You're so dead

520
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,157
Stop it!

521
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,358
I struggled to open this bar

522
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:10,106
And you tell me to run
like a chicken?

523
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:15,402
So you can take over
this place?

524
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:22,108
Yeah, I mightjust run
Only if I first get wasted

525
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:25,711
But I can't and won't

526
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:30,724
We might catch them
Who knows?

527
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,001
We have to!

528
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:51,110
You're a novice
I'm God of this game

529
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,650
- Should I help you?
- Can you?

530
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,416
My ID is 'Cicinnurus Regius'
When I see you on line

531
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,821
I'll make you invincible

532
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,221
Cicinnurus Regius?

533
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,922
Yeah Yours?
'Wandering Monk'?

534
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,532
- Don't forget my ID
- I won't

535
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,629
Do you know the legend
of 'Cicinnurus Regius'?

536
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,837
Of course, I do

537
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,437
What is it then?

538
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,837
Why the hell should I
tell you?

539
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,344
What is it?

540
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,251
I've placed an APB on the car
You can go now

541
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,152
Go where?
You're sending us home?

542
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,658
What, you wanna play
soccer with us?

543
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:40,753
Our lives are at risk here

544
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,459
Don't you have a witness
protection program?

545
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,967
Witness what?

546
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,867
You've seen too many movies

547
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,874
He's a bum
with nothing but time

548
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,478
You should protect us

549
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,081
Our taxes pay your salary

550
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,674
Do yourjob right

551
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,480
I doubt
you've ever paid taxes

552
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,782
Hey, Video!
Whose side are you on?

553
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,084
That's the truth

554
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,787
You can't even afford to
pay your late fees

555
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:16,889
You ran like a chicken earlier
You call yourself a man?

556
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,493
Yeah, I'm a girl, dick!

557
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,034
What?

558
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,098
What an annoying couple!

559
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,211
Couple?

560
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,610
Stop fighting
with your girlfriend

561
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,308
- What?
- Girlfriend?

562
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,346
Who?

563
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:40,117
- Hey, Video!
- What?

564
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,318
Stay out of my way
from now on

565
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,329
Don't even think about
renting videos from us

566
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,626
What are you, a moron?

567
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,928
It isn't the
only video shop in Korea

568
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:56,438
We don't need bums
for customers

569
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,740
Watch your back at night

570
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,040
Watch your back
during the day

571
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,213
Bitch!

572
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,219
I warned you

573
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,555
The interview is at three
Don't be late

574
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:24,065
I don't have a suit to wear
Can we do this later?

575
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,862
You can borrow mine

576
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,266
I didn't wanna worry
you guys, but

577
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:42,381
- My life is in danger
- I won't kill you if you show up

578
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,681
I'm notjoking

579
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,086
You think I am?

580
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:52,594
If you don't show up you're dead
and he's divorced

581
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,783
What?

582
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,081
I've been waiting for you

583
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:22,886
What for?
I'm off today

584
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,085
Let's go see a movie

585
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,891
Why should I see a movie
with you?

586
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,397
We're neighbors
and business partners

587
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,502
We can discuss ways to develop
our neighborhood over coffee

588
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,002
How about it?

589
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,404
I'm not in the mood, okay?

590
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,205
Turn me down, and you will
never see that book again

591
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,109
Suit yourself

592
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,216
You'll run up your late fees

593
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,013
Wait!

594
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,041
Hello?

595
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,117
I'm so busy

596
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,454
What do they want?

597
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,392
Why ask me?
I didn't call you here

598
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,961
Here they are

599
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:46,570
Hi I'm the lawyer
for the late Mr. Hwang

600
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,578
- Mr. Hwang?
- Who's that?

601
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,581
- That old man in red?
- Him?

602
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,914
How much will it be?

603
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,022
What?

604
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:03,985
The reward

605
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,655
Come on, the man is dead

606
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,364
You don't like money?

607
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,762
Fine
I'll keep it all to myself

608
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,441
Says who?

609
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,377
We'll split it in half

610
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,047
I was gonna go
but the police

611
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,248
- No more excuses!
- I'm not lying

612
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,758
Call him right now
and apologize!

613
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,260
I don't even know him

614
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,455
I don't fucking care
Call him you idiot!

615
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,760
If you don't call him now
I'll starve you to death

616
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,665
You never keep your word,
you piece of garbage!

617
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,170
- What's the number?
- Write it down!

618
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,467
If I drop dead today,
it's all your fault

619
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,067
You're so full of shit!

620
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,772
- Shoot
- 992-3285

621
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,974
- Worthless idot!
- 3285?

622
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,984
- Yes, son of a bitch!
- I'll call him, damn it!

623
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,246
- Right now!
- Fuck

624
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,450
What?

625
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,295
Guess I'm not the only one
who wants a piece of you

626
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,092
It was my sister-in-law

627
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,494
Is that how you talk to her?

628
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,195
Don't get started

629
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,501
You've got no manners
for anybody

630
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,604
My sister-in-law and I

631
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:35,310
We went to school together and she's
the daughter of my mom's friend

632
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:39,115
We go way back, okay?

633
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,334
Sorry to keep you waiting

634
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,796
Please, sit

635
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,739
Without you, we couldn't
have recovered his body

636
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,244
We owe you a lot

637
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,348
Thank you

638
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,747
We just wanted justice
to be served

639
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:15,757
That's all

640
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:21,661
I feel so sorry for him

641
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,768
and for his grandchild

642
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,962
Oh, that picture?

643
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,073
That's my sibling

644
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,367
Your sibling?

645
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,035
It was taken long ago

646
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,906
The child went missing
on a family picnic

647
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,087
My father had wanted
to find his lost child so badly

648
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,788
Please, take it

649
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:53,829
It's a token of my gratitude

650
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,791
You don't have to do this

651
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,429
You really don't

652
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:09,208
7, 8, 9, 10
5 Gs!

653
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,845
That much?

654
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,845
Look at the size of the house

655
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:16,146
This is chicken feed
for them

656
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,948
Should we be happy
about this?

657
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,422
We didn't kill him, did we?

658
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,153
If he'd made it, he would've
given us twice more

659
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,789
Let's go eat

660
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,264
It's my treat

661
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,069
Have you decided?

662
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,438
Yeah

663
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,480
- Why don't you order first?
- Sure

664
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,179
I'll have what she's having

665
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,253
Excuse me?

666
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,989
Get me the same thing
she's getting

667
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,789
Okay, sir

668
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,795
Go ahead

669
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,299
I'll have the same

670
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,308
This is pretty good

671
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:17,403
By the way,
we haven't met, have we?

672
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,609
- We shoulds stop swearing first
- I'm Mi-young, Jang Mi-young

673
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:25,620
Jang Miyoung? Got it!

674
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:30,523
- What's yours?
- Chang-sik, Kim Chang-sik

675
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,787
Chang-sik?

676
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:36,030
What?
My name's tacky?

677
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,929
That's not it

678
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:42,129
People always say their
names twice

679
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:46,231
It's a subconscious way of
letting themselves stand out

680
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,843
Is that right?

681
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,843
I'm a psychology major

682
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,939
I see
Speaking of which

683
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,245
- Let me ask you something
- What?

684
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:01,551
I always wondered
Do they teach you hypnotizm?

685
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,252
That's a piece of cake

686
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:08,057
Anybody can do it

687
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,463
- Stop lying
- Want me to prove it?

688
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,469
Here?

689
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,971
Close your eyes

690
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,270
Open both your hands

691
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:30,581
I'm dropping a feather on your
left hand, It's very light

692
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:38,184
I'm putting a metal bracelet on your
right hand, which is very heavy

693
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,694
The feather is so light

694
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,597
while the bracelet is
quite heavy

695
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,399
Open your eyes now

696
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,511
I can do this trick, too

697
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,113
What'd I say?
Anybody can do it

698
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,010
Keep eating

699
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:07,252
You're such a cheapskate

700
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,552
No matter where you drink,
it's the same beer

701
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,251
Stop bitching, just drink

702
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,159
What are you gonna do
with that money?

703
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,665
Get your face redone?

704
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,965
Anyway, this is on you

705
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:25,768
Right?
Right?

706
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,537
Waiter!

707
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:35,974
I studied psychology
so hard

708
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:41,090
But I failed to read her mind

709
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,288
I loved her so

710
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,591
'Dove'!

711
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:55,703
She used that shampoo,
didn't she?

712
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:04,408
I hear body odor is harder
to forget than faces are

713
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,413
Right?

714
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,216
Mi-young

715
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,724
You know what rules
in a capitalist society?

716
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,628
That is

717
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,931
A rich guy took 'Dove'
from you, huh?

718
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:34,142
- Mi-young, say 'Dove'
- Why?

719
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,746
- Say it slowly, Do...
- Do

720
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,441
- ve
- ve

721
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,612
Your mouth reminds me
of something

722
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,849
An asshole

723
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:54,093
What an asshole?
What the fuck!

724
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:04,264
Do I wanna be a bum?
Hell no!

725
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,377
You must know how I feel

726
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:12,881
I'm like the black goat

727
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:15,280
'Black sheep,' fool!

728
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,088
Zoo sings this, right?

729
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:27,891
When I was little
I lost my mom at the zoo

730
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:35,599
And the next minute
I was at this fucking orphanage

731
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,607
You're not listening,
are you?

732
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,904
Are you listening?

733
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:45,606
One minute you're a bitch
the next, you're an angel

734
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:49,116
Stop confusing me

735
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:55,213
You're trying to dump
the tab on me, aren't you?

736
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:04,761
Hey! I thought I was the one
to be carried home

737
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,200
God damn! She's heavy

738
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:14,942
I paid for dinner and beer
And now a piggyback!

739
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:19,106
What do I get in return?

740
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,773
What do I

741
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,584
Bingo!

742
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:35,827
The table's set
All I need to do is eat

743
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,964
No, slow down

744
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:44,096
Yeah, I know
You're horny too, huh?

745
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,535
Let me go wash up

746
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:06,354
No girl wants to kiss a guy
with bad breath

747
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,211
This is so disgusting!

748
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,450
You call yourself a girl?
I think not!

749
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,721
Look at these

750
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,666
Oh, it's a snowman
Kind of cute

751
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:47,586
I'm not the black goat

752
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,692
I'm not

753
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:03,396
Forget it
I've lost my appetite

754
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,781
Mom, get me some water

755
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:44,476
I knew I couldn't trust
this fuckface!

756
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,242
You son of a bitch!

757
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,780
Come here, asshole!

758
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:59,991
You asshole! Fuck!
Come here, you bastard!

759
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,597
You son of a bitch!

760
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,894
- What'd you do to me?
- Jesus Christ!

761
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,698
You slept on the wrong
side of the bed or what?

762
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:10,499
You touched me, didn't you?

763
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,108
What the hell did you do to me!

764
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:17,009
You have no fucking clue
what I went through

765
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,307
I shouldn't have trusted you!

766
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,916
I knew this would happen

767
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:24,020
Do you have any idea
what you did last night?

768
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,213
I don't even wanna go there

769
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,324
Look at that laundry!

770
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,426
You shitted in the bed

771
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,723
you disgusting bitch!

772
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,359
You fucking liar!

773
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,836
You're dead, shithead

774
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:51,344
You didn't call him
I might as well kill you

775
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:55,349
No name calling, please

776
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,248
What the hell is this?

777
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,854
I know you need a new bag

778
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,752
Bribery won't save

779
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,455
What's this?

780
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:08,655
A complimentary coupon
Do some shopping

781
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,595
Where'd you get the money?

782
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:14,130
What do you think?
I stole it

783
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,029
I'm going to bed

784
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:19,870
Hey!
Don't I get anything?

785
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,841
Catch it

786
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,211
Asshole!

787
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,545
What's up with him?
You staged this, didn't you?

788
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,119
Hell no!

789
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:34,951
I'd rather buy rat poison
and put it in his rice

790
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:40,189
Oh, God!
What time is it now?

791
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,998
- Mom
- Where'd you sleep?

792
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:46,466
At So-jung's

793
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,762
She asked me to sleep over
So I did

794
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,329
Why'd you turn your cell off?

795
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,345
- Chinese medicine for you
- What for?

796
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,609
It's supposed to be good
for menopause

797
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,341
I'm not menopausal

798
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:02,280
What is it then?
Puberty?

799
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,647
Where'd you get the money?

800
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:08,756
She owed me some money
and paid me back yesterday

801
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,053
Where'd you get the money
to lend her?

802
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,563
I know this is expensive

803
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:16,995
Just take it, okay?

804
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:20,293
Why can't you look me
in the eyes?

805
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,997
You lap-dance at private
parties or something?

806
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,538
You're unbelievable!

807
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,541
Where are you going?

808
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,613
You're very
close to getting it, girl

809
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:32,980
Is that my wallet?

810
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,358
My jacket's gone

811
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,093
That's my jacket

812
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,697
Why'd you do it?
Give it back

813
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,367
Confiscated

814
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,039
I risked my life for it

815
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:02,679
You need some dough?

816
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,842
Then ask me

817
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,179
Why take what's not yours?

818
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,681
Why?
Why in God's name!

819
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:14,484
Why are you doing this to me?
Why? Why? Why?

820
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,921
I even hooked her up
with my brother
