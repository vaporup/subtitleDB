1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:06,657
Why is that bitch so mean
to me?

2
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:23,616
Why'd she go through
my clothes?

3
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:28,512
I won't let her
get away with this

4
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:02,147
Missing Child
Snowman-shaped birthmark on the back

5
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:11,297
No way

6
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:17,467
Then again, why not?

7
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,231
Yeah, why not?

8
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,777
This could be her

9
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:25,909
Until when
are we doing this?

10
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:29,506
You think
I'm enjoying this?

11
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,619
Shut up and
keep your eyes peeled

12
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:35,621
Check out her legs
They're awesome

13
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:37,622
Mine are prettier

14
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,521
By the way

15
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,322
why'd you
hit me that hard?

16
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:43,624
Where'd he get these snacks?

17
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:46,734
I bet he can make noodles
out of newspaper

18
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:50,634
His pockets are like
trash cans

19
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:53,536
Look me in the eyes
when I talk to you, punk

20
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,142
- Look at me
- Look! That's him, isn't it?

21
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:57,040
- Him! Him, over there!
- What?

22
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:58,339
Him!

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,040
- Hide!
- Heads down!

24
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:05,812
Bitch!

25
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,364
What's up with those jackasses?

26
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:43,855
How fast can you run
100 meters?

27
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,992
- 10 seconds
- Is he superman?

28
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:57,903
You've got some nerve,
showing up here!

29
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,008
I'm on the run from them

30
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:03,202
Who?

31
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:04,903
Why'd you come here?

32
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:07,412
Don't worry, I've lost them

33
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,518
You sure?
Did you call the cops?

34
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:12,916
What's the point?

35
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:16,421
They do nothing but
tell you to wait

36
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:19,322
Why didn't you run
to your place?

37
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:22,919
- I needed to see you
- What for?

38
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:27,626
Mi-young, I don't want
you to get me wrong

39
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,235
- for asking this
- Get to the point

40
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:35,138
Let me hear what it is first

41
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:37,108
You're an orphan,
aren't you?

42
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,178
- Out
- Huh?

43
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:42,741
Get the hell out!

44
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:44,943
If not, fine
I knew you weren't

45
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,145
Get out!

46
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:49,822
- When we were drinking
- You're insane!

47
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,693
You said your mom
might be a step mother

48
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:54,762
Whatever Get out!

49
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:57,262
Wait, look at this

50
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:00,562
This is from that old man

51
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:13,208
Oh, Mi-young!

52
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:15,977
Let me tell you
I was on fire, girl!

53
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:19,678
I wish it were like this
everyday

54
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:22,588
What's wrong?

55
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:25,389
- Hey!
- Nothing

56
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,692
Something's bugging you
What is it?

57
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,197
- It's nothing
- You!

58
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,426
You lost all my cyber money,
didn't you?

59
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:38,266
You're so dead!

60
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:47,842
Okay, spill the beans
What is it?

61
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:54,047
Mom, I want you to
tell me honestly

62
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:55,887
What?

63
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:00,553
Am I your real daughter?
Am I?

64
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:05,359
Dad and you are my

65
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:11,966
Wait, wait a second

66
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:16,874
I have to go back out

67
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,470
I think that bitch
cheated me

68
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:23,277
She didn't give me
all she owed me

69
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:27,548
She always does that!
I should kill her!

70
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:33,394
He must've gone drinking
Thank God

71
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:36,691
I can't believe
we lost him again

72
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,696
That short-legged ass was fast

73
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,592
Keep your mouths shut
about this

74
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,598
Look who's talking
If he finds out, we're through

75
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:47,799
I'm hungry
Order some Chinese food

76
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:50,044
- Spicy noodles for me
- I want the plain ones

77
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:51,203
And fried dumplings

78
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:53,814
They're hard to chew
Get steamed ones instead

79
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:56,611
Sweet and sour pork
for me

80
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:08,660
Hey!

81
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:12,128
Wake the hell up!

82
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:18,430
Hey!
You got a call

83
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:19,631
Hello?

84
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:23,110
Damn!

85
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,140
You've got videos
to return?

86
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:30,012
- No, I don't
- It's for you

87
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:34,184
Hello?

88
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:38,049
Are you nuts?

89
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,455
You shouldn't be here

90
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:42,256
They're out looking for us
What if they see you?

91
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,065
What's wrong?

92
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:49,970
Chang-sik

93
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,167
Let's go to a motel

94
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,176
Now?

95
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:04,277
Can I trust you, Chang-sik?

96
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:10,688
Trust me
Just try to relax

97
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:14,693
Leave your body to me
so I can work you freely

98
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,896
I'm so nervous

99
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:27,204
Never done this before
If my body

100
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:33,303
Mi-young, I'll get you
through this

101
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:45,220
I'll count to three

102
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,420
And you'll fall asleep

103
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:51,464
One, two

104
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:55,893
Redsun!

105
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:10,840
If not, why would you see
an orphanage?

106
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,647
And what about the zoo?

107
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:15,949
Those images are real?

108
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,958
How come
I have no recollection?

109
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,756
Those with childhood trauma

110
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:24,865
tend to suppress those
painful memories

111
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,457
In many cases, it develops
into multiple personalities

112
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,069
- I'm beat
- What are you doing?

113
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:42,307
- I'm going to bed
- With me here?

114
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:46,342
I said no!
Get out of here

115
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,581
This is my place! Hey!
Come on, get out

116
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:55,894
What are you doing?
Get out! Now!

117
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,708
What's she doing?

118
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:15,179
It's Showtime, bitch

119
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,616
Our company has won
the Presidential Award

120
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:22,950
Don't let $1,000 in cash
slip away

121
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:31,892
You're holding this event,
aren't you?

122
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:37,332
What'd you get the
Presidential Award for?

123
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:39,667
Beat it, boy

124
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:45,635
How old are you,
calling me a boy?

125
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,944
Go deliver Chinese food
Get out of here

126
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:53,542
You're asking for trouble

127
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:54,950
You fuckers!

128
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,649
I deliver Chinese food,
so what?

129
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:00,556
That doesn't mean
you can talk shit to me

130
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:03,755
Get out
Make my day, fuckers

131
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:09,762
Get your ass out
I take shit from no one

132
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:12,566
Don't play with knives

133
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:15,574
My stomach!

134
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,473
I don't have to buy anything?

135
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,079
Of course not

136
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:22,672
This is fraud, isn't it?
Don't tell me this is free

137
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:26,378
Fill out the form
It's so free

138
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,011
Watch it, pal

139
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,381
- Name and phone number?
- And address

140
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:32,925
- Get out! Out!
- What for?

141
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:34,655
He's giving his number

142
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,557
Oh, that's right

143
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:38,757
- Is this it?
- Right

144
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,267
Let me put it in for you

145
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,198
Have we met before?

146
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:46,669
It won't work, mister

147
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,434
- What's going on?
- Fill this out

148
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:53,105
Free ginseng
and $1,000 in cash

149
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,349
What's the matter?

150
00:10:55,416 --> 00:11:01,787
It's just don't think
I can do this alone

151
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,934
- May I help you?
- Gosh!

152
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:56,174
Was there an orphanage here?

153
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:59,709
Until 7 years ago

154
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:01,381
I see

155
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:07,283
Why is she crying?

156
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:31,911
A snowman-shaped
birthmark on the back

157
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,809
Tell him it's the same year

158
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:36,416
and place as on the flyer

159
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:40,612
Same year and place
as on the flyer, sir

160
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,519
Oh, will you?

161
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:48,425
Yes, sir
Have a good trip back

162
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,466
What'd he say?

163
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,435
He's coming back
on the first flight tomorrow

164
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,538
He sounded very nervous

165
00:12:57,672 --> 00:13:01,540
I bet!
It's been 20 years

166
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,645
This is all thanks to you

167
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,543
Don't mention it

168
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:10,150
I'm just so happy that

169
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:13,344
I can help my best friend

170
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,355
We're the hands and gloves
that go together

171
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:30,497
Nice! It's for her own good

172
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:32,466
For mine, too!

173
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:37,008
One more beer!

174
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:39,272
So hard to spend money

175
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:43,377
God, still too long
before it gets dark

176
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,088
Hello?

177
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:54,492
I won free gifts?

178
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:29,422
Dude, long time no see
How are you doing these days?

179
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,728
Did you eat?

180
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,535
- Fuckers
- Get back here!

181
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,613
Upstairs!

182
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:17,070
Why are we chasing him?

183
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:24,080
What am I gonna do?
I'm so fucked!

184
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,898
Bastards!
What am I gonna do?

185
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:47,071
Hello?

186
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,809
What the fuck do you
want from me?

187
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,912
What have I done
to you fuckers?

188
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:55,037
What?

189
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,913
What wife?
I'm not even married!

190
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:01,919
I don't give a damn
what you do to her!

191
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:04,217
Do whatever you want with her!

192
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:06,724
Who are you guys anyway?

193
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,921
You're messing
with the wrong guy

194
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:12,498
To the parking lot?
Bastards

195
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:16,203
How the fuck
did I wind up with her?

196
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:18,831
I'm screwed now

197
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,573
Yeah

198
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:24,005
That's right
Getting used to that, aren't you?

199
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,718
The camera is ready to roll

200
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:36,114
I was sick to my stomach
because of you two

201
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,817
What have we done?

202
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,291
Sons of bitches!

203
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,521
Why don't we bury them?

204
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,030
What do you think they are,
a couple of pots?

205
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,192
Who wants to do it?

206
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,037
I haven't banged a girl
in 4 and half years

207
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:56,041
- You do it
- Okay, I'll do my best, boss

208
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,947
Wait! Wait!

209
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,177
Won't it be better
if I do it?

210
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:08,751
Think about it

211
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:12,347
If I'm in the video, I won't
be able to rat on you

212
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,552
Right?

213
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:18,361
I love that girl

214
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,366
What do you think this is?
A honeymoon video?

215
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:24,063
Think about it, man

216
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,173
Even though

217
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:33,472
You're a cold-blooded gangster
I'm sure you're warm at heart

218
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:37,281
She won't be able to do it
before the man she loves

219
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:39,386
Let me do it

220
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,882
It smells
What do you say?

221
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:45,492
What smell?
I smell nothing

222
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:50,393
It smells!
Let's check it out

223
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:51,395
Let's go!

224
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:53,933
Come on
I've got a dinner date

225
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:57,459
Not until we solve this case

226
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:58,932
Dinner's after
Let's go

227
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:02,373
Come any closer,
and I'll kill you!

228
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:07,005
It's better for me to do this
than these people

229
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:09,478
Over my dead body!

230
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,211
Step aside I'm doing it!

231
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,751
No, I'm doing it!

232
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:15,913
Shut the fuck up!

233
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,019
Or let them do it!

234
00:18:22,763 --> 00:18:24,128
These kind of videos

235
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:27,068
Better with some resistance
Don't you think?

236
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:28,626
Fucker

237
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,070
Just do it!

238
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,644
Nothing we can do

239
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:44,413
It'll be over before you
even know it

240
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:51,589
Make yourself believe
what I said earlier

241
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:55,720
This is the only way

242
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,893
Sorry to bother you
We're from the station

243
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,800
Oh, you guys are drinking

244
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:11,070
Drink with us
Sit down

245
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:14,941
We're not allowed to Drink
on duty, but

246
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:24,423
It's about a car outside

247
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,830
You own that car,
Seoul Da 1338, right?

248
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,561
- Potentia?
- Right

249
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:37,898
Where were you on the 12th?

250
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,098
Around midnight

251
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:45,905
I'm sure we were Drinking

252
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,143
Were you two together?

253
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:51,647
Yes

254
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,654
How much does it cost
to Drink here?

255
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:57,486
Depends on what you get
Let me pour you a shot

256
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:56,105
- I didn't know you had customers
- No, they're friends

257
00:20:56,217 --> 00:21:00,881
Why aren't they singing?

258
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:20,241
Sounds like they're fighting

259
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:23,301
Don't mind them
Come on, Drink

260
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,883
We gotta hit the road
after this

261
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:07,147
Look, detective

262
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:12,083
I was just wondering

263
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:20,063
Do I have to turn myself in
if I run someone over?

264
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:23,263
Do you know?

265
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,268
The insurance boys know
better than us

266
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:28,338
That's right

267
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:46,957
Help!

268
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:52,991
- Turn off the mike!
- The insurance boys

269
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:55,936
I only did what I was told to do!

270
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,996
He can't talk
This boy is a mute

271
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:01,004
He's a poor kid
He's from this Island

272
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:04,110
- What island?
- Detective Oh

273
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:07,805
- Where's that videotape?
- Right by the camcorder

274
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:11,315
Find it!
It's criminal evidence

275
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:15,320
Please, detective

276
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,924
You have to believe us
We're innocent

277
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,222
Save your breath, punks!

278
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:27,528
Sir, can you make it look like
I turned myself in?

279
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,697
Drink this

280
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:40,909
What a lousy day it's been

281
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:50,656
His son, he wants to
see you tomorrow

282
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:55,152
Who?

283
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:58,162
Your brother

284
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:06,031
Sorry I didn't ask you first

285
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,276
But eventually

286
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:14,973
You'll have to meet him

287
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:24,484
Hi

288
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,286
How are you?

289
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:29,562
- Glad to see you again
- You, too

290
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,293
- Where?
- Outside

291
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:38,235
Let me tell you
It wasn't an easy decision

292
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:48,404
- I had to...
- If he were alive

293
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,915
He would've been
so happy

294
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,110
I'm so sorry

295
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:57,121
He jogged every night
to stay in shape

296
00:24:57,257 --> 00:25:00,055
so he'd live long enough
to meet his lost child

297
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:06,559
Now

298
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:10,534
Meet your sibling

299
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:18,138
You've been separated
for a good 20 years

300
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:23,739
Here's the child your father
looked so hard for, Hwang Mi-young

301
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,590
Look at your brother
Come on

302
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:53,944
Brother

303
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:57,449
Brother!

304
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:04,654
Oh, God!

305
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,297
Mr. Choi, we gotta talk

306
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:44,862
This is a boy?

307
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:47,934
He looks like a girl, though

308
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:53,338
Who made these holes?

309
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:07,080
See you later

310
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:05,174
- Get up
- I'm tired, leave me alone

311
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,843
Get up!

312
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:13,716
Boy, life wears you out

313
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:21,022
I can understand now
why you're so bitter

314
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:25,891
I never imagined it'd be
at a place like this, but

315
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,860
let me tell you
everything

316
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:30,935
What is it, mom?

317
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:36,532
It's kind of complicated,
but simply put

318
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:39,441
You and your sister have

319
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:44,744
different fathers

320
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:45,943
What?

321
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:51,149
Your sister's father was
a friend of your father's

322
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,749
I remarried your father

323
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:58,956
Soon after
your sister's father died

324
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:03,058
I'd known him, though

325
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:05,671
People spoke ill of me

326
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:09,367
They almost stoned me
for remarrying

327
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:14,879
a friend of my late
husband's

328
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:19,782
But I never loved your
sister's father

329
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:27,984
It was your father that I truly loved
and I still do

330
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:35,230
Up until now

331
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:38,202
I've had so many guys
after my beauty

332
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:41,796
But I've remained faithful

333
00:29:41,942 --> 00:29:44,274
When I miss him
so much

334
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:49,003
I stare into the air, and

335
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,117
You know why I'm crazy on cards?

336
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:54,812
I play cards to stop myself
from missing him

337
00:29:54,955 --> 00:30:00,222
Otherwise, I would've gone
insane long ago

338
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:05,859
So

339
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:12,995
My father's dead?

340
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,303
They say daughters carry
on their moms' fate

341
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:18,911
I hope you don't

342
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,951
What's going on?

343
00:30:36,663 --> 00:30:40,997
Watch your back, asshole

344
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:44,867
Why do you let her
torture you like that?

345
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:51,443
We're all dying here
tonight

346
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:52,237
Help!

347
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:55,940
You two don't deserve to live!
Come here!

348
00:30:56,082 --> 00:31:00,041
She's found out about
the account

349
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:06,718
Chang-sik, get your ass
over here!

350
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:16,066
Make yourself useful
and do the laundry

351
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:19,661
You shouldn't work
on Sundays

352
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:21,467
Get a cup!

353
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,775
I'm working my ass off
to feed you brothers

354
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:29,780
Can you put this on for me?

355
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:33,977
Just like your brother!
Don't know how to wear a tie

356
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,687
- When's it due?
- February

357
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:44,953
I can't believe that little girl
I knew is becoming a mom

358
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:48,859
I was taller than you
back then

359
00:31:49,002 --> 00:31:52,165
I know

360
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:06,783
Closing the barn door
after the horse is stolen

361
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,582
Be sure you brush up on
what you learned today

362
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:11,987
OK, that's it kids!

363
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,592
What's your name?

364
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:27,802
Shirts...
Am I missing anything?

365
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:31,604
- My sunglasses!
- On your head, fool

366
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:34,305
Oops!
Let's go

367
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:38,713
- Where are you going?
- We're going on a trip

368
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:42,015
Oh, for your 2nd anniversary?

369
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:45,921
Don't forget you have
a bun in the oven

370
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:49,023
He looks tired

371
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:52,325
Make sure you get him
a souvenir

372
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:54,330
Did you get the camcorder?

373
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:56,935
Forget it
We're late

374
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,833
We need that!

375
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:01,338
Let's rent one there

376
00:33:01,474 --> 00:33:06,434
- Chang-sik, we're leaving
- Okay Have fun!

377
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,790
Wait! Wait!

378
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,558
Won't it be better
if I do it?

379
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:24,725
Think about it

380
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:30,234
If I'm in the video, I won't
be able to rat on you

381
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:37,939
I love that girl

382
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:42,845
I'd rather die than see her
have sex with another man

383
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:47,847
I'm in love with her

384
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:03,960
Hello?

385
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:06,933
Jang-mi!

386
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:12,167
- That'll be $2.8
- Can I buy another snack?

387
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:14,371
Anything less than 20 cents

388
00:34:14,514 --> 00:34:17,381
- It's $3 then, right?
- Thanks

389
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:38,597
Excuse me
Can I go through?

390
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:45,611
It's been a while

391
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,279
Buying anything?

392
00:34:52,752 --> 00:34:54,583
No, selling something

393
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,589
Look, back then...
I was just

394
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,691
Dad, buy me this

395
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:14,031
He's justjoking
He likes to call me dad

396
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:17,041
What a sly player!

397
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:20,340
That's not it
Why am I your dad?

398
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,742
I'm not his dad!

399
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:24,349
Go explain it to her!
Why am I your dad!

400
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:26,611
You make me crazy!

401
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,445
I've become a giraffe
waiting for you

402
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,386
Been away?

403
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:08,187
I didn't order anything

404
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:11,092
Not here on the job

405
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:14,792
Be nice to me cause I've got
something nice for you

406
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:16,330
Movie tickets!

407
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:19,767
I'll take them off your late fees

408
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,404
What? Wow

409
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:27,478
This kind of attitude
often takes me aback

410
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:30,912
I don't want them
Take them and get out

411
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,019
How can you be so

412
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:38,324
Hey, Mr. Bum!
Long time, no see

413
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,325
I notice you haven't
changed your part yet

414
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:46,330
It's getting dark outside
and we're Ionely

415
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:50,527
Let's go hit the movies

416
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,831
You really wanna see
a movie with me?

417
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:56,635
I'd like to do everything
with you, babe

418
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:01,745
Meet me at Teddy Home
in an hour

419
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:06,250
- For real? You're notjoking?
- You don't believe me?

420
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:07,353
Of course, I do!

421
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:12,151
I'll be waiting for you

422
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:17,292
You're really going
to a movie with him?

423
00:37:18,498 --> 00:37:21,661
I bet he'll buy you
noodles on the date

424
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:25,266
Don't go

425
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:30,572
Please, don't go

426
00:37:34,414 --> 00:37:36,177
I said, don't go!

427
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:37,749
Or I'll

428
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,883
put that video up
on the Internet

429
00:37:55,435 --> 00:38:00,896
Who do you think you arer?
Are you threatening me now?

430
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:07,409
Do you know what a fool I became
because of you?

431
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:13,414
You made a complete fool
out of me!

432
00:38:13,553 --> 00:38:14,754
And you never even call

433
00:38:14,754 --> 00:38:19,157
You never even brought
around your ugly face!

434
00:38:20,293 --> 00:38:22,591
Put what on the net?

435
00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:26,322
I didn't mean it

436
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:33,501
Do whatever you want with it!

437
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:37,236
Why don't you sell it
to a porn site?

438
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:40,369
The instant that you do that
I'll make sure you rot in jail

439
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:44,645
You freaking psycho!

440
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:48,946
You didn't have to hit me!

441
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:53,825
I did call you!

442
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:57,254
But you never answered it

443
00:38:57,397 --> 00:38:59,524
That's not my fault!

444
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:03,631
Hey, Video!

445
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:06,395
I'm talking to you!

446
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:14,871
You never answered
the damn phone

447
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:17,943
Why is that my fault?

448
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:21,218
Get a life, bitch

449
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:24,453
Jang Mi-young!

450
00:39:27,627 --> 00:39:30,460
I'm sorry, damn it

451
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:54,582
Are you coming today?

452
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:01,454
What the...
Are you coming today?

453
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:05,257
I know you won't win
Why don't you model for us?

454
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:06,956
- For panties?
- Yeah

455
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,260
You really want your sister
to get naked on TV?

456
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:10,961
I'm your only sister, you know?

457
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:13,766
Be there, okay?

458
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:15,373
Be there!

459
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:21,172
- The answer is number 4
- Isn't it 5?

460
00:40:21,314 --> 00:40:23,782
That's right
What?

461
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:28,182
- You said it was 4
- I did? I'm sorry

462
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:34,583
- Miss Jang Mi-young, get ready
- Okay

463
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,193
Let me introduce our
next contestant

464
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:41,300
Come on out!

465
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:48,605
I Love Quiz
Welcome to the show

466
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:53,603
We have a beautiful young
lady with us today

467
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:56,544
Miss Jang Mi-young, how are you?

468
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:57,717
Good, thanks

469
00:40:57,717 --> 00:41:02,177
Could you tell us
what you do?

470
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:08,523
I... um...

471
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:12,427
In short
I collect late fees

472
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:16,035
Okay

473
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:19,627
Video...

474
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:23,833
And I act

475
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:26,945
- You act?
- At home, I mean

476
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,950
I suppose
you do a lot of things

477
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:35,850
Okay, are you ready?

478
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:51,829
Cappuccino rocks!

479
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,202
What kind of coffee
do you like most?

480
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:58,072
I hate coffee

481
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:00,771
I totally get you

482
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:04,280
I hate Chinese food more
than Osama Bin Laden

483
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,949
Tell me, babe

484
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:10,585
I'm free after 8 tonight

485
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:12,020
Wanna go out?

486
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:16,584
That's correct

487
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:22,793
I've been wanting to ask you
Who are those ladies over there?

488
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:25,301
Oh, my mom and sister

489
00:42:25,438 --> 00:42:26,700
Oh, I see

490
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:32,004
I can see you got your looks
from your mom

491
00:42:32,145 --> 00:42:36,514
All of you are so beautiful

492
00:42:36,649 --> 00:42:40,016
Okay, let's move onto
the next question

493
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:55,025
You call this a drawing?

494
00:42:55,168 --> 00:43:00,128
Don't be so hard on me
Why don't we eat and

495
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:04,437
Is that all you think about?

496
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:09,947
You're as cheesy
as someone I know

497
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:18,651
Here are some hints

498
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:23,660
Chinese poet, poem
King Hyunjong, Yang Kuei-fei

499
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:27,823
You're wearing a big smile
That means you're confident

500
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,766
You know the answer,
don't you?

501
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:35,965
Or not
Give us your answer to level 8

502
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:38,770

- What is 'Cicinnurus Regius'?
- Correct!

504
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:48,378
- How much so far?
- I think it's $3 K

505
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:49,886
No, I heard him say 5 K

506
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:51,990
- Why'd you even ask?
- Shut up!

507
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:57,994
Each bird has one wing
they can only fly as a couple

508
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,896
That's right

509
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:05,526
- Who am I describing?
- I'm home

510
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,006
You've got 5 seconds

511
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,106
So difficult

512
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:19,014
- Who is Mendel...
- You have to be specific

513
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:20,311
Who is Mendeleev?

514
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:23,889
Mendeleev
Correct!

515
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:31,222
Level 10
Only one question left

516
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,092
If you get this one correct
you'll be the Quiz Master

517
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:36,961
I'll give you the clue
Look at the monitor

518
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:42,199
It's 'Freud'

519
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:45,967
Will you challenge it?

520
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:49,771
You haven't used your chance yet
Either phone or Internet

521
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:55,512
Your mom and sister are
going wild back there

522
00:44:55,788 --> 00:44:58,985
Have you decided?

523
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:03,320
Should Ichallenge it?

524
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:06,329
Don't ask me

525
00:45:06,465 --> 00:45:07,727
- Sorry, nerous...
- It's the first time

526
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:11,030
that a contestant has asked me that
You have to decide for yourself

527
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:13,636
What's it gonna be?

528
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:19,035
- I will
- She's challenging it!

529
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,537
She's not the only girl out there
I'm not calling her

530
00:45:23,683 --> 00:45:26,243
No way
No fucking way

531
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,317
He established the concept
of the social character

532
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,550
Who is he?

533
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:37,561
It's the final question

534
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:41,963
You can be the Quiz Master
The smile is gone

535
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:45,468
She looks rather nervous
You have a chance left

536
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:49,665
You can use either the phone
or the internet

537
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:52,676
- I'll use the phone
- Sure

538
00:45:52,812 --> 00:45:55,679
Who will you call?

539
00:45:56,916 --> 00:46:02,183
- Just...
- You don't have a person in mind?

540
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:06,087
The phone is right
in front of you

541
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:10,491
You've got 30 seconds

542
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:12,392
Make your call

543
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:31,910
- Hello
- Hello?

544
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:34,417
It's me, Mi-young

545
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:41,816
Hello? Hello?
Chang-sik, are you there?

546
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:47,922
- What are you calling a psycho for?
- No swearing, please

547
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:50,126
Is this some kind ofjoke?

548
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,430
I've got a question
for you

549
00:46:52,571 --> 00:46:56,132
Why didn't you
answer my calls?

550
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:59,836
- Think about it
- Now I'm in

551
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:04,848
You think I meant to
make a fool out of you?

552
00:47:04,984 --> 00:47:07,350
I don't have much time

553
00:47:07,486 --> 00:47:09,750
Neither do I!

554
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,449
Don't yell at me!

555
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:15,560
I'm not a bum any more
I even got a job now!

556
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:16,558
Hello?

557
00:47:16,695 --> 00:47:19,061
Let me finish before you
hang up on me!

558
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:21,633
Come on, listen to me

559
00:47:23,002 --> 00:47:25,266
- I mean...
- What should I do?

560
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:27,964
- Hello?
- I know very well

561
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:32,874
I often say things
that I don't mean

562
00:47:33,012 --> 00:47:34,673
We don't have time for this

563
00:47:34,814 --> 00:47:36,179
Just answer my question

564
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:40,081
- Who established...
- Things got crazy

565
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:42,585
All I'm saying is

566
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:45,281
Let me talk!

567
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:49,292
I realized later

568
00:47:49,428 --> 00:47:52,989
what I'd done to you

569
00:47:53,132 --> 00:47:56,898
What's wrong with you?

570
00:47:58,437 --> 00:48:00,997
I was so worried about you
that I couldn't sleep

571
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,801
What

572
00:48:04,043 --> 00:48:09,310
I staked out your place
at night

573
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:12,482
Hang up!

574
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:16,414
What's your point?

575
00:48:17,356 --> 00:48:22,521
I'm just...
Can we go steady?

576
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:24,128
What?

577
00:48:25,664 --> 00:48:29,532
Or we can talk about it
some other time

578
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:32,637
Some other time?

579
00:48:35,808 --> 00:48:38,572
No, tell me now

580
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:43,210
I'm in love with you

581
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:46,807
What did you say?
I couldn't hear you

582
00:48:46,952 --> 00:48:51,218
This is so embarrassing
I know you heard me

583
00:48:51,524 --> 00:48:53,253
You heard me!

584
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,591
I love you!

585
00:49:11,977 --> 00:49:13,774
Miss Jang Mi-young?

586
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:20,316
I...

587
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:24,952
We'll meet and
talk about it, okay?

588
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,059
Now?
Where?

589
00:49:28,193 --> 00:49:30,957
At theconvenient store

590
00:49:31,297 --> 00:49:34,095
Hello? Hello?

591
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,564
I didn't mean for this
to happen

592
00:49:39,405 --> 00:49:40,963
What was the question?

593
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:43,438
At the convenient store

594
00:49:46,011 --> 00:49:50,471
I can't believe these people
It's a quiz show for Christ's sake!

595
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:53,881
Crazy!
Where's the remote?

596
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:00,387
Every guy named Chang-sik
sucks!

597
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:10,200
Mi-young! Mi-young!
Taxi! Taxi!

598
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:12,998
- Get in
- Us?

599
00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:48,039
Where's she going?

600
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:50,038
- Good heavens...
- Drink this, mom

601
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,837
Does she know how many panties
I have to sell for $30 Grand?

602
00:50:52,978 --> 00:50:56,141
She was amazing, though
Knowing all those things

603
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:59,411
- How did she do that?
- Excuse me

604
00:50:59,585 --> 00:51:00,950
We'd like an interview with you

605
00:51:01,086 --> 00:51:03,179
- For TV?
- Yes

606
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:09,056
I'm so proud of my little girl

607
00:51:09,128 --> 00:51:16,398
You don't see that kind of romance
these days, how beautiful

608
00:51:27,413 --> 00:51:30,541
Pull over
Stop the car!

609
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:43,090
Chang-sik! Chang-sik!

610
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,694
- Chang-sik!
- Mi-young!

611
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:52,798
Stay right there
I'm coming across

612
00:51:52,938 --> 00:51:57,898
Not here
Come to the crosswalk!

613
00:52:23,368 --> 00:52:25,529
What are we doing now?

614
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,932
It feels so weird

615
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:32,438
- Have you had dinner?
- Not yet

616
00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:35,342
Let's eat
What would you like?

617
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:37,676
- What?
- Sushi?

618
00:52:39,685 --> 00:52:41,949
Stay there
I'll come to you

619
00:52:42,087 --> 00:52:46,353
Ok, you stay there
I'll come to you

620
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,861
I told you I'd come to you

621
00:52:59,004 --> 00:53:03,065
I thought you told me
to come to you

622
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:06,268
God! I told you to stay there

623
00:53:06,378 --> 00:53:10,940
It doesn't matter
We're here together

624
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:17,678
Yeah, in the middle
of the damn road!

625
00:53:20,926 --> 00:53:22,621
Tell me

626
00:53:23,629 --> 00:53:25,392
What?

627
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:29,194
- There you go again!
- What?

628
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:33,498
I told you how I feel about you
on the phone

629
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:38,099
And you said
we would talk about it in person

630
00:53:38,243 --> 00:53:40,507
You did, didn't you?

631
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:42,136
Chang-sik

632
00:53:42,548 --> 00:53:43,742
What?

633
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:50,321
Hug me

634
00:53:51,657 --> 00:53:53,215
Come on, this is too embarassing

635
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,225
There's people looking
and cars passing by

636
00:53:57,262 --> 00:53:59,730
Oh, boy!

637
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:10,037
What the hell is she doing
in the middle of the road?

638
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,134
Mom, don't!
They look great

639
00:54:14,279 --> 00:54:17,840
I bet you did the same
with dad, didn't you?

640
00:54:17,983 --> 00:54:20,247
Not like that

641
00:54:29,595 --> 00:54:30,994
Shit!

642
00:54:31,697 --> 00:54:34,165
I told you to hug me
not grope me

643
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:36,164
I thought it'd be okay

644
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:37,102
What the hell are you
talking about?

645
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:39,662
I never told you it was
okay to grope me!

646
00:54:39,805 --> 00:54:41,773
What's wrong with you?

647
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:44,068
You guys are all pigs
They can never

648
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,770
What a picture!
Get a room!

649
00:54:53,218 --> 00:54:55,584
I'm sorry

650
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:58,588
Are you nuts?
There are people watching us!

651
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:02,182
- I wasn't going to, but...
- But what?

652
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:04,295
I got aroused

653
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:08,388
Did you have to put your
damn tongue in my mouth?

654
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,398
I'm sorry

655
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:12,901
We could've done it later!

656
00:55:13,038 --> 00:55:16,201
Why'd you hug me?
It's your fault

657
00:55:16,341 --> 00:55:19,708
You got me horny!
I can't believe this!

658
00:55:19,845 --> 00:55:23,212
God, we're stuck again!

659
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,218
It's your fault!
Come back!

660
00:56:02,688 --> 00:56:05,490
Get up now!

661
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:10,189
Fuck! I'll save up and
buy out this restaurant

662
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:12,025
Not in a million years!
You're too lazy

663
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,494
The early bird
catches the worm

664
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:17,101
Who knows?

665
00:56:17,536 --> 00:56:19,504
I might find my parents
who are loaded

666
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:21,129
And get a load of money

667
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:23,572
Get up and bring back
the empty plates!

668
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:25,700
Okay! Okay!

669
00:56:42,828 --> 00:56:45,797
Get the lion
It's head's big, you know

670
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:47,694
Once you get a hold on him
It won't fall

671
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:50,996
Make a lot of money!
