Oh, you want to trade bunkers?

To protect you
from surface conditions,

00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,608
your bunker
is 30 feet underground.

383
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,277
The artificial day cycle

will keep
your sleep patterns normal.

with enough Supplival powder
to last a lifetime.

387
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,521
When mixed with water,
Supplival creates

00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,458
a delicious shake
that's packed with nutrients

389

in vanilla, strawberry
or chocolate.

The purifier filters
contaminated air molecules

400

and strips them off the virus.

The 500,000 bunkers
that make up the network,

operate in tandem
to eliminate the viral threat.

for how long this process
will take based on daily data,

405

which you can view
on your statistics terminal.

to ensure that the virus
spreads no further.

To combat the inevitable sense
of isolation,

we created Domain.

410

412
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:51,217
Domain also allows full access
to our encyclopedia archives.

413
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,953
Studies found that groups
of seven

414

create an ideal long-term
social-networking community.

I'm trying to be zen
about what you and Denver did.

673
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,678
We agreed on a hierarchy
way back when all this started,

you and Denver,

to do your own thing.

you should do whatever you want,

- whenever you want.
- You know that lifting

the ban on Orlando
was the smart thing to do.
