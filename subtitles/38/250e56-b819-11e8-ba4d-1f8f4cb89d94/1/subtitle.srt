1
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,279
Hey, don't vomit. If you do, I'll make
you eat every bit of it.

2
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,474
Now for a loop-the-loop, so get ready!

3
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,284
What the hell's Brooklyn doing at the controls?

4
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,562
He throws up every time he grabs the joystick!

5
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,053
He's a mechanic, not a pilot!

6
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,368
I've heard it before, Bebe.

7
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,464
But it's time he and Mary-Ann got acquainted.

8
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,805
I told you to take your hands off your weapon.

9
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,957
I'm not on a suicide mission with Brooklyn.

10
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,074
We land in five minutes.

11
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,847
That's government bullshit.

12
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,244
Hope you're right, man.

13
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,435
Looks like a real hullabaloo.

14
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,062
What's this, another war?

15
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,939
Bad things happen when you tool with a gun.

16
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,777
Hey, listen to this!

17
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,241
I bet we'll be buried in money
by this time tomorrow!

18
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,256
What's Kyron 5's level?

19
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,390
What's this line for?

20
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,171
We go in, we get the chips.

21
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,874
And that's it.

22
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,110
We go in, we get the chips,
and we get out.

23
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,668
That's what Bancho said.

24
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,292
Hear that? Just now? A strange sound?

25
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,799
Look, it's burning!

26
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,555
What worries me is what took 'em down.

27
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,613
Let's go to Borneo.

28
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,243
It's still hot.

29
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,076
What's wrong?

30
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,048
Listen, let's go to Borneo.

31
00:10:59,425 --> 00:10:59,625
Enough of that, Bombay.

32
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,926
Take it off.
Enough of that, Bombay.

33
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:01,187
Take it off.

34
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,830
Robocola, Pepsi type.

35
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,560
Made on Island 8JO, 2023.

36
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,602
How nostalgic.

37
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,755
You know, I was thinking.

38
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,926
We can move it better than
some lousy chips.

39
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,027
What?

40
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,794
A Gunhed.

41
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,159
Too heavy.

42
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,735
I told you we only came to
get the Kyron chips,

43
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,067
and I told you to stop playing
with that, didn't I?

44
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,500
Bad things do happen when
you tool with a gun.

45
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,803
All right!

46
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,981
Brooklyn, let's go!

47
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,689
Your routine, Brooklyn.

48
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,798
Rangers.

49
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,152
We're treasure hunters.

50
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,236
Maybe we want to know why you're here.

51
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,970
I only wish you were right about that.

52
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,686
Electric barrier?

53
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,880
We can't go back?!

54
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,694
And you buzz all the way out here?

55
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,127
Kind of a long hop.

56
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,276
This isn't Texas anymore.

57
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,437
We want this Biodroid as badly as you!

58
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,169
It's not very wise to make a ranger angry.

59
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,904
We're gonna get the chips with Bombay.

60
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,930
You cover us while we go ahead.

61
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,203
What if she wakes up?

62
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,077
I'm picking up something.
Moving right for you.

63
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,203
I know.

64
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,849
A sound activated mine's drifting in the air.

65
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,441
Cut all voice communication.
All sensors on mute.

66
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,410
It really is. A series nine R two, 2010.

67
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,845
It's ancient. It won't explode.

68
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,694
Where's Bombay?

69
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,134
This can't be happening.

70
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,465
We gotta save Bombay!

71
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,367
She's right.

72
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,835
Like you said, we're bandits.

73
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,194
Bebe!

74
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,469
Bebe!

75
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,473
Bebe!

76
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,718
Is that all you care about?

77
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,700
My partners died for this.

78
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,894
I won't give it up for anything!

79
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,339
What're you doing?

80
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,119
My leg!

81
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,855
It hurts!

82
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,749
All of a sudden, the Biodroids launched
an attack against human beings.

83
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:17,052
One of them stole the vial and returned
here, as if programmed to do so.

84
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,320
Bad break for us treasure hunters.

85
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,169
Bancho, if he was alive, would've said,

86
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,668
"Forget the chips, go get the vial."

87
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,037
Where the hell is Nim?

88
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,126
Who are you?

89
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,095
I'm the one who saved you.

90
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,766
Then why were you hiding?

91
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:05,224
You looked weird. Screaming and weeping...

92
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,100
I was with someone else.

93
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,043
Where is she?

94
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,540
You two wanna get off this island?

95
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,716
It's no use.

96
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:52,817
What about the ocean?

97
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,806
Just try.

98
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,932
That's Eleven. I'm Seven.
Eleven lost her voice.

99
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,339
Who are they? What kind of place is this?

100
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,083
A plan might help.

101
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,887
Use these kids?

102
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,584
No, don't.

103
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,028
Eleven will take you to Kyron.

104
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,259
This is dangerous. This isn't child's play.

105
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,701
Where did you get this?

106
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,602
It's garbage from the Robot War.

107
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,796
Show me where!

108
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,734
Run!

109
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,686
Because you saved their asses,

110
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,711
this place is too dangerous now!

111
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,086
My seat.

112
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,994
I'm a mechanic.

113
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,325
I don't drive.

114
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,692
Saving my butt?!

115
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,073
You... saved my butt?!

116
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,706
Adults... Always trouble.

117
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,167
The only way back to Mary-Ann
is through Kyron Dome.

118
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:35,572
Nim's plan is to take this truck first,
then walk, climb and crawl.

119
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,735
According to Eleven, it's at least
twenty hours to Kyron.

120
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,911
Brooklyn! Brooklyn!

121
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,566
It's a nickname.
I don't know what it means.

122
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,897
Bancho called me that.

123
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,126
Where are we?

124
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,806
Gunhed parts.

125
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,941
Everywhere.

126
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,191
It started yesterday. You brought that
strange, eerie sound with you.

127
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,934
We need a Gunhed in order to
get that monster robot.

128
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:30,610
Manipulate a finger a certain way, and
it will activate the energy matrix.

129
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,412
The processorâ€™s dog meat.
But the core's in good shape.

130
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,240
I can convert it to a manned machine.

131
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,257
What we need is a pilot.

132
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,100
Gimme the vial, Nim.

133
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,283
A chemical accident.

134
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,251
Don't you wanna find out
what Kyron's up to?

135
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,255
Seven, show the via! to the camera eye.

136
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,172
The new and ultimate energy form.

137
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,214
I graduated from Beverly Hills High School.

138
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,392
The countdown?

139
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,898
At the Kyron Dome?

140
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,582
Brooklyn! Brooklyn!

141
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,451
Nim! Nim!

142
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,620
If we get to work on this Gunhed here,
we can get to Kyron again.

143
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,256
We need this Gunhed.

144
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,553
And a pilot.

145
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,131
Me? You must be kidding.

146
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:46,901
I'm a mechanic.

147
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,174
I get carsick in a cockpit.

148
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,525
That's how I lost everything.
Air Force... My job...

149
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,930
If Bancho hadn't picked me up...

150
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,503
Not a chance.

151
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,988
What'd you expect to find?

152
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,990
Ah, a Balkan gun.

153
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,733
What else?

154
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,999
A weapon rack. With a six-barreled
missile launcher...

155
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,940
Why did you come back? Nim told you to?

156
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,901
You'd get your butt blown off without me.

157
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,185
First, the vial. Then the keyword.

158
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,688
And Kyron 5 will have total
control of the planet.

159
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,749
As long as we have the vial,
Kyron 5 won't wake up.

160
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:46,293
But I don't like the way the
Biodroid died in the pool.

161
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,429
What were the shining worms
that pierced Bebe?

162
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,529
Found them?

163
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,292
Bebe?

164
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,313
Bebe!

165
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,859
Nim! Can you hear me?

166
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,692
Answer me, Nim. Nim!

167
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,726
Nim! Nim, can you hear me? Nim!

168
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,893
Nim, can you hear me? Nim!

169
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,236
Shut up and listen.

170
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,205
The Biodroid has regenerated.
It's after the vial.

171
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,002
The Gunhed got hit too.

172
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,073
The energy matrix is dead.

173
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:21,449
What's this? For God's sake, what is this?

174
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,230
Anyway, I'll see you at Kyron Dome
in twenty hours.

175
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,857
The Gunhed will be there too.

176
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,501
Fuel tank, fuel tank, fuel tank
for air-conditioning.

177
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,148
Seven, put this in the fuel tank, would you?

178
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,691
Seven?

179
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,885
Hey, be careful with it, Seven.

180
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,884
Where's Nim? What happened to
the two of them?

181
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,385
That's enough.

182
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,803
Let's party, Gunhed...

183
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,805
We'll fill you up on the road.

184
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,885
Who's the boss here, anyway?

185
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:50,580
FonNard...

186
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,610
We've got the weapon rack on.

187
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,168
Your time's up, Seven.

188
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,480
Explode the sidewalls.

189
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,380
Give me thirty seconds after the explosion.

190
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,956
Let's go, Gunhed.

191
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,073
Seven, you promised.
Get back to the truck.

192
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,896
Activate the environmental sensor.
Optical scope "On".

193
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,693
Number 1, check. Number 2, check.

194
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,095
Radiation sensor check!

195
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,633
Infrared sensor check!

196
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,967
Rear weapon rack in number one position.

197
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,536
Gather up your courage.

198
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,414
Slow and easy. FonNard.

199
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,166
What is this?

200
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,034
Get down! Down! Down! Down!

201
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,005
Don't embarrass me!

202
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,835
All right, fonNard...

203
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,231
Warm up the chain gun.
We'll see if it works.

204
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,459
Ready to fire!

205
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,584
Do something about the noise!

206
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,637
Activate the grappling gun.

207
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:22,895
What's that sound?

208
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:25,834
I don't like surprises!

209
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,709
Check the cooling system!

210
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,059
Please, Gunhed. Move your butt, will you?

211
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,842
Good.

212
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,940
Don't fall, don't fall.

213
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,444
Huh? Optical? What's that?

214
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,783
Can't you make it simpler?

215
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,591
No sweat, buddy.

216
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,472
Seven?

217
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:10,439
Sorry!

218
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,009
Where the hell are you?!

219
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,611
By the booster.

220
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,346
Get up here, on the double!

221
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,447
I can't.

222
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,347
Help him, Gunhed.

223
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,017
Can't you turn your leg or something?

224
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,090
You're a man, Seven. Try it!

225
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,691
Even a woman couldn't do it!

226
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,386
In forty seconds I have to fire the booster.

227
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,288
Go ahead, I'm prepared to die.

228
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:43,000
Stop the sequence.
Fifty-five tons doesn't sound so bad.

229
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,910
Fire the booster!

230
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,811
The "NOSE" is coming down. I got it!

231
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,181
Hurry up and fire!

232
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,716
Fire!

233
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,583
Don't play with the bomb, Seven.

234
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,946
I connected the cable, Gunhed.
Any reaction?

235
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,331
Yeah, I'm counting on you.

236
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:57,505
Enemy sensors think Gunhed's
getting the data down there.

237
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,116
If we could only fool the
vibration sensitive one...

238
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:03,984
I know. I'll confuse them
with these bombs.

239
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:08,124
Ten minutes will be enough. After that...

240
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,126
I'll do what I like.

241
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:12,321
We'll get off this island together.

242
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:17,460
Maybe I don't want to leave.
Maybe I like it here.

243
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,590
Bad things can happen when
you fool with a gun.

244
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,773
Brooklyn, we've hidden some food and water.

245
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,300
If it's marked "Seven," it's safe.
"Eleven" is dangerous.

246
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:04,238
I have to cut the voice communication.
Anything else?

247
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,650
Don't die.

248
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,277
Yeah, I won't die.

249
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:16,857
Got the data?

250
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,927
Any info about Nim and Eleven?

251
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,732
Such a sensitive answer!

252
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,134
Show me level 260.

253
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:34,642
Seven's gonna save ten minutes for us.
Be aggressive.

254
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,008
Blow up A-S.

255
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,605
What's this?

256
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,149
So, we take a ride.

257
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,024
If they detect us, right?

258
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:55,259
How far can we get in ten minutes?

259
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,568
Well, then, Gunhed, my dear...

260
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,035
Let's try tank mode, shall we?

261
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:04,230
This is a bad joke. In fact,
this is a moving coffin.

262
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,020
Oil canal? You didn't say you could swim.

263
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:56,910
You could've asked for my opinion
about this. We're not waterproof.

264
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:02,790
I'm talking about discipline, numb-nuts.

265
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,982
We'll get off at 385 and get the coolant.

266
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:49,654
So, now what?

267
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,996
Then let's get off at 381.

268
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,573
So... then... what?

269
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:06,908
Brooklyn! Brooklyn!

270
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,299
How long have I got?

271
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,055
We're trapped inside the reactor.

272
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,426
Thanks for letting me know.

273
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,826
I'm going out!

274
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,616
Do it quickly, Gunhed! I'm coming out.

275
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:40,869
Hurry up, Gunhed! Quicker! Faster!

276
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,495
Can't you make it move faster?

277
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:26,143
Tell me exactly what's gonna happen.

278
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,526
What'll happen if they find us?

279
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,906
Cheer up, everybody.

280
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:56,250
You too, "NOSE".

281
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:16,826
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

282
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,033
Can't make it! We're out of fuel.

283
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,644
This is the last gas station.

284
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,007
The upper floors are death valley.

285
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,350
I'm not playing.

286
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,629
Just getting ready to go it alone from here.

287
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,866
In those vessels? Those whiskey barrels?

288
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,815
Robots and whiskey, huh?

289
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,685
So long.

290
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:51,262
I gotta go it alone.

291
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:00,571
What're you talking about?

292
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,600
You serious? About the whiskey?

293
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,110
What's the ammo situation?

294
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,790
Doesn't give us much time.

295
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,850
And your armor's in lousy shape.

296
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,376
She scared me to death. That's why...

297
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,525
What if we draw the Aerobot's attention?

298
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:33,998
The Biodroid?

299
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:36,836
Can Nim handle it alone?

300
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:47,546
You related to somebody named
Bancho, by any chance?

301
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,649
Just checking.

302
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:59,319
Show them just how good we really are.

303
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,002
You got it, buddy.

304
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,562
Gunhed, standing mode!

305
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:24,881
I knew you'd say that.

306
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:08,610
Don't booze up, Gunhed.

307
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:38,999
Who's sending this?

308
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,601
Come on, straight ahead. I'm here.

309
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,330
Come over here. That's right.

310
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:07,150
What the hell is that code?
C'mon, tell me, Gunhed.

311
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,173
Yeah, big boy, come on!

312
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:26,035
Geronimo!

313
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:26,526
Bebe!

314
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,006
Bebe!

315
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:14,004
Where's Seven? Seven!

316
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:36,529
I kept my promise.

317
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,872
Where's Gunhed? He died?

318
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:13,991
What'll happen to Gunhed?

319
01:37:19,633 --> 01:37:22,261
Look! A message from Gunhed!

320
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:25,996
He's alive!
