18
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,336
<i>They were given a final physical</i>
<i>examination and pronounced all fit.</i>

19
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,837
<i>The crew then had a breakfast</i>
<i>consisting of half a grapefruit,</i>

<i>twelve ounces of orange juice,</i>

22
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:22,468
<i>The crew is now in the gantry</i>

23
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:25,213

- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Horace.

27
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:32,886
Are we late?

28
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:34,511
Traffic was terrible.

29
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,469
Well, I see you're all in good spirits.

30
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,504
- Have you done the EDS test yet?
- They're almost completed.

31
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,794
- Do you want us to enter?
- In a moment.

32
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,095
What's up?

33
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:50,387
I'm not very good at things like this.

34
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:53,208
I've known you, especially
Colonel Brubaker,

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,162
for some time.

36
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:59,834
What you're about to do today,
I've spent my life.

37
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:05,507
I'd just like you to know that I feel
that all I've ever worked for,

38
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:08,421
it has meaning today,
and I'm very proud.

39
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,257
Proud of the program

40
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:13,881
and proud of what I've been able to
contribute in some small way, and

41
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,253
proud of you.

42
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:20,009
I'd like for you to take
this Bible with you,

43
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:21,973
from me, from all of us.

44
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,296
Why, Horace, I don't know
what to say.

45
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:27,455
- Well, try saying nothing for a change.
- Horace...

46
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:29,756
thank you.

47
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:32,550
We'd be honored to take this with us.

48
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,044
Well, gentlemen, let's go to Mars.

49
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,615

51
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:45,219
<i>Wives of the flight crew at the Cape</i>
<i>will be flown back to Houston</i>

52
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:47,475
<i>- following launch.</i>
- Good morning, Congressman Peaker.

53
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:50,678
We've reserved three of the best seats
for you and for General Enders,

54
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:51,922
right next to Vice President.

55
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,142
Is he here yet?

56
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,920
No, sir, he's due any moment.

57
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:59,713
Asshole probably thinks they'll delay
the launch for him.

58
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,700
Someone should tell him this is not
a bridge opening.

59
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:05,185
I hope you and Mrs. Peaker will be
very comfortable.

60
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:08,221
The Agency would like you to have
these commemorative binoculars

61
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:10,675
to help you watch the launch
and to remember this day.

62
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:13,511
That's very nice. Look, Emily.

63
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,597
They have the date,
Capricorn One emblem in gold.

64
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,886
- Very nice, Hollis.
- I'm glad you like them.

65
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:21,139
Well, we'll need another pair
for my wife.

66
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,311
I, I beg your pardon, sir?

67
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,387
Oh, don't make a fuss, Hollis,
it's all right.

68
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,427
I said, 'we'll need another pair
for my wife.'

69
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,431
- It's really not necessary.
- Here, Emily, take mine.

70
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,282
- I really won't need them.
- No, I don't...

71
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,062
Congressman Peaker,
there's only a limited...

72
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,464
I didn't quite hear what you said.
Would you mind repeating it, please?

73
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:40,215
Oh, there's no problem.
I'll get another pair right away.

74
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,133
Very thoughtful of you.

75
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:47,433

- Phyllis?
- Hello, Hollis.

86

Emily, glad to see you.
Hollis, how are you?

Very well, Mr. Vice President.

88

- How is the President today?
- Oh, just fine, thank you, Hollis.

89
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,478
He asked me to personally express
his regrets at being unable to be here.

90
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:40,984
There were some pressing matters

91
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,020
that needed his attention
in Washington.

92
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:44,394
Like getting re-elected?

93
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,479
Mr. Vice President? I hope you and
Mrs. Price will be very comfortable.

148
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:28,830
Initial stage thruster check is normal.

149
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,818
<i>We're coming up on</i>
<i>T-minus 1 min. 30 seconds.</i>

150
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,284
<i>The final range safety checks</i>
<i>are completed.</i>

151
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,617
<i>The Launch Safety Officer</i>
<i>reports all systems</i>

152
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,987
<i>are normal and we are Go</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

153
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,488
<i>The launch escape tower is now</i>
<i>fully armed.</i>

154
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,956
<i>In the event of an abort,</i>

155
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:46,410
<i>the tower will carry the command</i>
<i>module away from the launch vehicle</i>

156
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:49,657
<i>and will activate a system of</i>
<i>control shift at 10.000 feet.</i>

157
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:53,327
<i>The flight crew reports all guidance</i>
<i>and navigation systems</i>

158
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,441
<i>functioning properly.</i>

159
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:58,452
<i>The Range Safety Officer reports</i>
<i>alternating systems are operating.</i>

160
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,111
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

161
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,031
It's that big tall white thing over there.

162
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:11,157
You can't miss it.

163
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,392
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,</i>
<i>Capricorn Control.</i>

164
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:20,837
<i>We're at T-minus 1 min.</i>
<i>and still counting.</i>

165
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:23,210
<i>All systems are go.</i>
<i>All lights are green.</i>

166
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:26,493
<i>We should have launch vehicle</i>
<i>power transfer right about now.</i>

167
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:31,288
<i>Roger, Houston, we read</i>
<i>nominal A.L.C.S.</i>

168
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:32,319
<i>Roger, Captain.</i>

169
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,169
<i>We're at T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

170
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:38,406
At the present time, all systems
are go. All lights are green.

171
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:48,003
Gentlemen, we're going to be
a little while.

172
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,575
You and your men might be more
comfortable in these.

173
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,622
<i>We're at T-minus 18 seconds.</i>
<i>from lift-off.</i>

174
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,490
<i>We're T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

175
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,993
<i>T-minus 10 seconds., nine, eight</i>
<i>- we have ignition-</i>

176
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,284
<i>six, five -we have outboard</i>
engines-

177
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,839
<i>three -we have inboard engines-</i>
<i>one, zero.</i>

178
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,704
<i>We have a launch commit. We have</i>
<i>a lift-off at 35 minutes. after the hour.</i>

179
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:25,910
<i>Roger. We are starting yaw.</i>

180
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,506
<i>Roger, roll program complete.</i>

181
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,793
<i>Vehicles on targets and running</i>
<i>smoothly.</i>

182
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,203
<i>Looking good, Capricorn.</i>

183
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:34,632
<i>We're coming up on T-plus 40 seconds.</i>

184
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,794
<i>Staging should be in the next</i>
- 30 seconds.

185
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,437
<i>Outboard cutoff should be 10 seconds.</i>

186
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,044
- Obeco, Capricorn.
<i>- Roger, Houston.</i>

187
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,216
<i>Have outboard cutoff.</i>

188
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:47,169
<i>Obeco at T-plus 2 minutes. 29 seconds.</i>
<i>Going for staging.</i>

189
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:48,710
You are go for staging, Capricorn.

190
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,083
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>
<i>Five,</i>

191
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,369
<i>four, three,</i>

192
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:55,620
<i>two, one.</i>

193
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:57,747
<i>We reached staging.</i>

194
00:10:57,962 --> 00:10:58,759
We copy.

195
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:03,504
<i>We have separation. Confirmed.</i>
<i>T-plus 2 minutes. 43 seconds.</i>

196
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,660
- S-two ignition.
<i>- We have S-two.</i>

197
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,510
<i>We have second stage ignition.</i>

198
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:10,463
<i>S- two ignition at T-plus</i>
<i>- 2 minutes. 46 seconds.</i>

199
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:13,010
<i>The vehicle is 47 miles down range.</i>

200
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:16,708
<i>Altitude: 43 miles.</i>
<i>Velocity: 6.100 miles per hour.</i>

201
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:20,922
Mr. Vice President, please,
give my regards to the President.

202
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,375
Oh, yes, I'll be very happy
to do that, Hollis.

203
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:27,464
I, uh, hope that whatever problems
he found so important

204
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,345
not to be here today,

205
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:31,423
I hope he has considerable success
with them.

206
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,428
Well, that's really very sporting
of you.

207
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:37,126
I'm sure the President will be very
pleased to learn of your support.

208
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:41,132
The President would get considerable
more of my humble support

209
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:44,596
if he would only be a little more
helpful with this program here.

210
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:48,496
Now, Hollis, you know the President
is most interested in this program.

211
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,122
I am most interested in a lot of things,

212
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,380
including my wife's bridge game.

213
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,838
That is not the same as
supporting something.

214
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:01,884
Hollis, there are many people who feel
that we have problems here, on Earth

215
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,139
that merit our attention

216
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:06,506
before we spent billions of dollars
on outer space.

217
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:10,134
There are a number of people who feel
there are no more pressing problems

218
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:12,255
than our declining position
in world leadership.

219
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:15,373
It was wonderful seeing you again,
Hollis.

220
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,123
The pleasure was all mine,
Mr. Vice President.

221
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,515
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,</i>
<i>Capricorn Control.</i>

222
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:24,716
<i>You're at T-plus 2 hours, 16 minutes,</i>
<i>into the flight.</i>

223
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:27,407
<i>The spacecraft is now</i>
<i>in elliptical orbit</i>

224
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:29,844
<i>with an apogee of</i>
<i>- 141 nautical miles</i>

225
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:32,475
<i>and a perigee of 122 nautical miles.</i>

226
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:35,886
<i>Mission Control reports full voice</i>
<i>contact with the flight crew.</i>

227
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,628
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

228
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:40,559
Welcome, Colonel.
Would you please come with us?

229
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:43,699
I'm not going anywhere till somebody
tells us what the hell's going on.

230
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:47,165
- Everything will be explained to you.
- Bullshit, I wanna know right now!

231
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:50,596
Colonel, I know this sounds strange,
we are all working for the same thing.

232
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:51,757
We are not your enemy.

233
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,008
Please, wait here.

234
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,885
I suppose you're wondering
why I called you up here.

235
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:47,181
Good morning.

236
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,472
Hi there, Dr. Kelloway,
nice to see you.

237
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,216
A funny thing happened
on the way to Mars.

238
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:00,676
Well, why don't you all sit down?

239
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:03,806
Well.

240
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:11,764
Okay,

241
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,883
here it is.

242
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:18,761
I have to start by saying that
if there was any other way,

243
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:24,435
if there was even a slight chance
of another alternative,

244
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:28,760
I would give anything not to be here
with you now, anything.

245
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,637
Bru, how long have we known
each other?

246
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,771
Sixteen years, that's how long,

247
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:39,884
sixteen years.

248
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:43,818
You should have seen yourself then.

249
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:46,095
You seemed walked out
of a Wheaties box.

250
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:49,851
And me, all sweaty palmed and
deadly serious.

251
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:54,981
I told everybody about this dream I had
of conquering the New Frontier

252
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,689
and they all looked at me
like I was nuts.

253
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,348
You looked at me and said, "yes".

254
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:02,440
I remember when you told me
Kay was pregnant.

255
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:04,229
We even went out and got crocked.

256
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:08,315
I remember when Charles was born.
We went out and got crocked again.

257
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:11,440
The two of us, Captain Terrific
and the Mad Doctor

258
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,362
talking about reaching the stars

259
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,646
and the bartender telling us
maybe we'd had enough.

260
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,226
Sixteen years.

261
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,355
And then, Armstrong,

262
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:26,103
stepped out on the Moon
and we cried. We were so proud.

263
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:32,484
Willis, you and Walker, you came in
about then, both bright and talented.

264
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,656
Looked at me in my
wash and wear shirt,

265
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,643
carrying on this hot love affair
with my slide rule

266
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:40,686
and even you were caught up
in what we'd done.

267
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,481
I remember when Glenn made
his first orbit in Mercury.

268
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:51,191
They put up television sets in
Grand Central Station,

269
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:55,681
and tens of thousands of people
missed their trains to watch.

270
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,979
You know, when Apollo Seventeen
landed on the Moon,

271
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:03,653
people were callin' up the networks
and bitchin'

272
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:06,403
because reruns of I Love Lucy
were cancelled.

273
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:07,992
Reruns, for Chrissake!

274
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,257
I can understand if it was
the new Lucy Show.

275
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:12,487
I mean, what the hell is
a walk on the Moon?

276
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:13,482
But reruns?

277
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:14,934
Oh, Jesus!

278
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,237
And then, suddenly,
everybody started talking

279
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,076
about how much everything cost.

280
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,980
Was it really worth twenty billion
to go to another planet?

281
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,238
What about cancer? What about
the slums? How much does it cost?

282
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:28,858
How much does any dream cost?
For Chrissake!

283
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:31,441
Since when is there an accountant
for ideas?

284
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,943
You know who was
at the launch today?

285
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:37,768
Not the President,

286
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:40,396
the Vice President, that's who.

287
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:44,192
The Vice President
and his plump wife.

288
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:48,107
The President was busy.

289
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:51,197
He's not busy.

290
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,613
he's just a little bit scared.

291
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,121
He sat there two months ago

292
00:16:57,157 --> 00:17:00,108
and put his feet up on Woodrow
Wilson desk.

293
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:02,197
And he said, "Jim...

294
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:04,485
make it good.

295
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,695
Congress is on my back.

296
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,575
They're looking for a reason
to cancel the program.

297
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:13,815
We can't afford another screw-up!

298
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,948
Make it good!
You have my every good wish."

299
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,784
His every good wish. I got his
sanctimonious Vice President,

300
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,063
that's what I got!

301
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:28,864
And so there we are,
after all those hopes

302
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:30,832
and all that dreaming.

303
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:35,077
He sits there with those flags
behind his chair

304
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:37,574
and tells we can't afford
a screw-up.

305
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,999
And guess what?
We had a screw-up.

306
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:43,864
A first-class, bonafide,
made-in-America screw-up!

307
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:48,369
The nice people from Con-Amalgamate
delivered a life-support system

308
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:51,554
cheap enough so they could make
a profit on the deal.

309
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,703
Works out fine for everybody.
Con-Amalgamate makes money,

310
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,912
we have our life-support system,

311
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,156
everything is peachy!

312
00:17:58,454 --> 00:18:01,807
Except they made a little bit
too much profit.

313
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:05,160
We found out two months ago,
it won't work.

314
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:10,030
You guys would all be dead in three
weeks. It's as simple as that.

315
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,913
So all I have to do is report that
and scrub the mission.

316
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,619
Congress has its excuse,

317
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,243
the President still has his desk
and we have no more program.

318
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:22,157
What's sixteen years?
An actual drop in the bucket!

319
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:27,706
All right, that's the end of the speech.
Now, we're getting

320
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:29,862
to what they call
the moment of the truth.

321
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,618
Come with me,

322
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,157
I wanna show you something.

323
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,245
<i>Roger, Houston. TMI burn time</i>
<i>will be 5 minutes. 45 seconds.</i>

324
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,950
<i>Roger, Capricorn.</i>

325
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,660
Delta vapor burn time 3.3 seconds.

326
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
There's a door here. I'm gonna open it
and walk into another area.

327
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:01,404
If you follow me, you'll see a bit more.
I'll answer some questions and...

328
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,571
and we're going to...

329
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,327
Why don't you just follow me?

330
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,626
You don't really think you're gonna
get away with this?

331
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:33,953
Well, I don't know, it's a chance.

332
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,576
Maybe it's not a very good one,
but it's a chance.

333
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,835
- Who knows about this?
- Almost nobody.

334
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:44,081
Houston is monitoring the actual flight.

335
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,587
All the telemetry is coming from
the Command Module,

336
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:49,467
so are your voices and medical data.

337
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:52,455
We recorded everything from
the practice simulations.

338
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,451
They don't know.

339
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:58,880
All we need from you is the actual
television transmissions

340
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,748
during the flight and the Mars landing,
that's all.

341
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:04,162
Just the television transmissions.

342
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,660
That's all?

343
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,126
Just the television transmissions.

344
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:12,844
We inserted a change in
the onboard computer,

345
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:16,006
so the spacecraft will land
two hundred miles off target

346
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,511
when it returns to Earth.

347
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:20,167
You'll be flown to an island
near that point.

348
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:22,720
From there you'll be transferred
to a helicopter.

349
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:27,000
The helicopter will fly you to the space
capsule and you'll be put inside.

350
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:31,799
It'll take the Recovery Forces
a minimum of an hour and a half

351
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,804
to reach the splashdown site.

352
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:36,045
By then, you'll be inside the capsule.

353
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,055
When the prime recovery carrier
arrives,

354
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:43,002
they'll find you inside the capsule
and take you out of the spacecraft.

355
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:45,918
You've thought of everything.

356
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,133
I don't know. I hope so.

357
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,711
Of course, you're sure we'll go along,
right?

358
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,163
No, I'm not.

359
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:57,502
What if we say no?

360
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,504
I don't know.

361
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:01,713
Don't say no.

362
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,093
When does Allen Funt come running in
and tell us we're on Candid Camera?

363
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,515
Jesus! you think I like this?

364
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:10,385
You think I really believe I'm standing
here in this craziness

365
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,807
telling you about patching
and tape recordings

366
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:16,506
and telemetry and an island two
hundred miles from the target zone?

367
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,255
I don't, I don't know what the hell
I'm doing, either!

368
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:23,417
I just case so Goddamn much,
I think it's worth it.

369
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:26,629
I'm not even sure of that.
I just think it.

370
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:28,636
I think I'm gonna throw up.

371
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:31,074
Well, that'll solve everything.

372
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:32,601
Well, what's this all gonna solve?

373
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:34,960
It'll keep something alive
that shouldn't die!

374
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:39,043
Before you all begin to moralize,
you take a look around.

375
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,128
You look at what we've done and
how much more we can do.

376
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:46,573
You look at what we've meant
to this country.

377
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,090
Nobody gives a crap about anything
any more.

378
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,889
People close their garages,
and triple lock their doors,

379
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:55,394
they hide under the beds,
they even, they're even afraid

380
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:58,556
to turn on their television sets
for fear of what they might find out

381
00:21:58,592 --> 00:21:59,717
in the evening news.

382
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:02,172
There's nothing more to believe in.

383
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:05,015
Now, you wanna blow this whole thing
wide open?

384
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,052
God knows what it might do
to everybody.

385
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,973
I'm sorry. I'm so Goddamn sorry.
I just don't know what else to do.

386
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,386
I'm hanging on by my fingernails,
just like everybody else.

387
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:17,005
Go on, you, you wanna be the ones

388
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:20,555
who give everyone another reason
to give up?

389
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:21,761
Go on!

390
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:25,973
This is really wonderful.

391
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,522
We go along with you

392
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,054
and lie our asses off,
and the world of truth and ideals is...

393
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,380
protected.

394
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:36,642
But we don't wanna take part in
some giant ripe-off of yours

395
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,267
and some how or other
we're managing to ruin the country.

396
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,494
You're pretty good, Jim.
I'll give you that.

397
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,648
Now, now, now, you're twisting
my words.

398
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:46,434
- Don't sell yourself short!
- Don't sell the program short!

399
00:22:46,685 --> 00:22:49,469
Don't oversell it. I'm not so sure
that cancelling a flight

400
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,431
or cutting off appropriations
means America folds up.

401
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,685
It's not as simple as that
and you know it!

402
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:56,764
I don't know it.

403
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,132
If the only way to keep
something alive

404
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:02,934
is to become everything I hate,

405
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,894
I don't know if it's worth
keeping it alive.

406
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:08,430
Please, Bru, don't talk like that.

407
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:11,770
What the hell's the matter with you,
'Please, Bru, don't talk like that?'

408
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:14,602
I don't think this is right!
All the rest is bullshit!

409
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,557
You have to help!

410
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,479
- What do you mean I have to?
- You have to help!

411
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:21,151
And what if I don't?

412
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:24,020
Please, don't put me in a corner.

413
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,175
You're crazy.

414
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,688
You know that? You are crazy! You've
got us in the middle of this nuthouse!

415
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:32,478
and you don't wanna be put
in a corner?

416
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:35,135
Your families!

417
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:40,356
- What about our families?
- Please, you have to help!

418
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,731
- What about our families?
- You have to help!

419
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,694
Shit, this thing is outta my hands!

420
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,981
You think it's all a couple
of looney scientists?

421
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,308
It's not! It's bigger!

422
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,292
There are people out there,
forces out there,

423
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:55,394
who have a lot to lose!
They are grown-ups!

424
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:58,107
It's gotten too big!
It's in the hands of grown-ups!

425
00:23:58,143 --> 00:23:59,279
What about our families?

426
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:03,144
They are flying back from the Cape to
Houston! They are all on the plane!

427
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,481
Naw, you're not serious.

428
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:10,066
- Please, Bru, don't make me!
- You son-of-a-bitch, tell me!

429
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:13,266
They're on the plane together!
You want it in writing?

430
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:16,681
There's a device! It's on the plane!

431
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,192
There's some people! If I don't give
the 'all clear' signal they'll explode it!

432
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:25,192
Don't you understand?
It doesn't have to be like this!

433
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:26,602
You have to help!

434
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:29,271
It's gotten outta control! It's too big!

435
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,062
You wouldn't.

436
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,234
Tell me you wouldn't.

437
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:42,559
I, I can't tell you that, Bru.

438
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:52,604
This coffee is horrible.

439
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:56,153
- It's not that bad.
- It is. It's that bad.

440
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:57,648
Don't drink it.

441
00:24:57,737 --> 00:25:00,225
I'm always unwrapping things.

442
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:03,570
I wake up and take the cellophane
off the drink glass.

443
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:05,608
The soaps in the Holiday Inn wrapper,

444
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:09,738
even the toilet has a paper band on it
with a nice little note from the hotel

445
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,938
saying they put the band on the toilet
for my protection.

446
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,051
I'm afraid that if I stay
in bed too long,

447
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:18,072
the maid walks in the room
and surround me and

448
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:19,697
the bread spread with a paper band.

449
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:20,494
I don't mind.

450
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,202
You wait. After a while you won't
know what city you are in.

451
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,781
I defy anyone to tell me the difference
between the Holiday Inn in Houston

452
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,031
and the Holiday Inn in Cincinnati.
The rooms are the same.

453
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,828
The music in the elevators
is the same,

454
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,948
even the ladies with too much makeup
in the coffee shop are the same.

455
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:37,406
You never know where you are
until after breakfast,

456
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:39,693
- when you read the paper.
- I don't mind it.

457
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,204
Well, I don't mind it that much, either.

458
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,449
It's just that I would like it all to be
with someone I care for,

459
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,121
someone I could share it with.

460
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:49,646
- Bullshit.
- You're so damn cynical.

461
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,991
I'm not cynical. It's just that your act
could use a little polish.

462
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:55,283
- What do you mean by that?
- Liz Haller, for starter.

463
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,357
It was at the California Primary?

464
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:01,700
I believe you used the one about both
witnessing to the unfolding of history.

465
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:03,950
You've got to admit it's better
than soap wrappers.

466
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:06,320
You think all I wanna do is jump you.

467
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:07,654
Yes.

468
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:10,528
You wouldn't know sincerity
if it ran over you.

469
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,618
- Not if you were driving it.
- I'm glad I'm not like you.

470
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:15,075
I have better legs.

471
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,361
Okay, I give up.

472
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,108
Don't give up so easily,
just change your approach.

473
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:23,819
What approach would you like?

474
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:27,785
How about something like, uh,
'I would like to jump you'?

475
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:28,832
Think that would work?

476
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:31,869
It has more chance than wanting
to share a life together.

477
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:33,943
- I would like to jump you.
- Go jump yourself.

478
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:44,826
I'm sorry that you had to wait outside
the house all day like this.

479
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,238
There is not much that I can say
except that

480
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,865
I'm very excited
and proud.

481
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,668
Everything seems to be going
smoothly.

482
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:57,864
Dr. Kelloway called to say that Bru
and the crew were in excellent spirits.

483
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,658
How has all this disrupted
your family routine?

484
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,704
- Terrific question.
- Shove it!

485
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,072
Well, the children will continue
to go to school

486
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:09,078
and we'll try to maintain
a normal existence.

487
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:14,914
I suppose that's all that I have to say.

488
00:27:14,951 --> 00:27:16,461
Thank you all for coming.

489
00:27:16,498 --> 00:27:19,496
Uh, I just came out to say hello
and go back inside now.

490
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,532
Thank you. Goodbye.

491
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,953
Dr. Bergen?

492
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,792
- Yes, Elliot?
- I wonder if I could talk to you

493
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:48,415
- for a moment.
- What is it?

494
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,547
Well, there's somethin'...
I have a problem, sir.

495
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:54,416
- Oh, are you feeling all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. It's the readout.

496
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:56,798
What about the readout?

497
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,215
Well, I, I just can't figure
something out.

498
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:02,340
- Well, perhaps I can be of some help.
- Well, I hope so.

499
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:05,251
See, I ran a check on the transmission,
on my own on the signals.

500
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:06,757
- On your own?
- Yes, sir.

501
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:09,090
- I like your dedication.
- The readout...

502
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:12,252
The television signals are coming in
ahead of the spacecraft signals.

503
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,257
It's like they're closer or something.

504
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:17,711
Oh, that's not possible. There must be
some malfunction in your equipment.

505
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:21,128
Well, I don't think so, Dr. Bergen. You
see, I doubled checked that console.

506
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:23,836
- Which console are you on?
- Thirty-six, sir.

507
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:25,300
Well, that's the answer.

508
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,883
We've been having problems
with the circuitry on thirty-six.

509
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,438
We've had trouble with it before.
I'll make sure it's repaired and,

510
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:34,957
thank you for showing me the problem.
You have initiative, I like that.

Hello.

556
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:48,387
Hello, Mr. Vice President.

557
00:31:49,978 --> 00:31:51,554
Yes, it's wonderful, isn't it?

558
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:54,385
Proud moment for all Americans.

559
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,304
You can tell the President
that's very gracious of him.

Goodbye.

Asshole.

566
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,689
Dr., I wonder if I can speak
to you for a moment.

567
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:30,561
Certainly, what seems to be
the problem?

568
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,136
Well, I just can't figure
something out, sir.

569
00:32:33,481 --> 00:32:34,476
What is that?

570
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:38,695
Well, I'm not exactly sure,
but it's the readout.

571
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:43,105
I told Dr. Bergen about it a long time
and he said it was in the console.

572
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:45,273
I'd like you to take a look at it.

573
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:49,112
- Well, what console are you on?
- Telemetry, sir, thirty-six.

574
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:53,191
Oh, yes, Dr. Bergen told me about that.
We had that console repaired.

575
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:54,863
I know, sir, it's just...

576
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,641
I keep on having the same readouts.

577
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:59,140
Well, what readout?

578
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:03,525
Well, sir, I ran a program on my own
just to check something

579
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:05,432
and the readout is different.

580
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,148
You ran your own program?

581
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,437
Yes, sir,

582
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,145
and...

583
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:15,192
I don't think it's the console.

584
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:20,276
Well, we'll have it shut down and
I'll see that it's serviced.

585
00:33:20,313 --> 00:33:23,027
Thank you, Elliot, for bringing
the matter to my attention.

586

00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:18,441
<i>The ladder is steady.</i>
<i>I am three steps from the bottom.</i>

601
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:22,440
<i>I'm two steps from the bottom.</i>

602
00:34:26,115 --> 00:34:27,738
<i>Houston, I'm on the bottom step.</i>

603
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:32,900
<i>Houston, I am gonna set foot</i>
<i>on the surface.</i>

604
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:35,984
Ready slow-mo.

605
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,192
<i>I take this step</i>

606
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,233
<i>in the journey of peace</i>

607
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:42,484
<i>for all mankind.</i>

608
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,944
Take slow-mo!

609
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:52,445
<i>Houston, I am on the surface.</i>

610
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:54,697
Roger, Capricorn. We copy.

611
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:56,740
<i>I am starting to walk now.</i>

612
00:34:58,617 --> 00:35:02,777
<i>Houston, the surface is solid.</i>
<i>Visibility is good.</i>

613
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,777
<i>I'm walking toward the camera</i>
<i>now.</i>

614
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:08,486
<i>The footing is solid.</i>

615
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:12,199
<i>Surface seems powdery.</i>

616
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,617
<i>I am picking up the camera now.</i>

617
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,118
<i>I have the camera.</i>

618
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:20,234
<i>The picture will get shaky</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

619
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:23,988
<i>The footing is good.</i>

620
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:29,321
<i>Houston, I am setting</i>
<i>the camera down now.</i>

621
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:32,528
<i>The rocks seem very porous.</i>

622
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:36,200
<i>Houston, I am outside the hatch.</i>

623
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:38,572
<i>Houston, I am on the ladder.</i>

624
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,157
Ready slow-mo.

625
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:43,696
<i>Houston, I'm stepping</i>
onto the surface

626
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:44,777
Take slow-mo!

627
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:53,453
<i>Houston, I am on the surface.</i>

628
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:56,534
<i>We are going to set the flag</i>
<i>on the surface.</i>

629
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,461
<i>We do not claim this planet</i>
<i>in the name of America.</i>

630
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:03,910
<i>We claim it in the name of all the</i>
<i>the people of the planet Earth.</i>

631
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,998
<i>We hope that our visit will increase</i>
<i>the understanding</i>

632
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,337
<i>of the human race.</i>

633
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:10,295
Walker should be activating
the tape soon

634
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:12,452
with the prerecorded message
from the President.

635
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:15,907
<i>Houston, I am starting the tape.</i>

636
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,212
<i>"To the men of Capricorn One.</i>

637
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:20,998
<i>I bring you greetings</i>
<i>from your fellow Americans</i>

638
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:23,911
<i>and all the citizens of the world."</i>

639
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,490
<i>You are so far away.</i>

640
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:29,991
<i>It takes light more than 20 min.</i>
<i>to reach you from here.</i>

641
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,656
<i>One could say not only light,</i>

642
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,163
<i>one could say time.</i>

643
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,583
<i>You are in another time from us,</i>

644
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,072
<i>the future.</i>

645
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,284
<i>We will never be the same,</i>

646
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,423
<i>for this moment</i>

647
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,616
<i>more than any moment</i>
<i>in our history,</i>

648
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,293
<i>has made all of the people</i>
<i>in the world realize</i>

649
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,083
<i>that we are part of the planet,</i>

650
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,291
<i>that is part of the system,</i>

651
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,750
<i>that is part of the Universe.</i>

652
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:59,536
<i>We are a small energetic species,</i>

653
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:04,537
<i>capable of pettiness,</i>
<i>yet capable of brilliance.</i>

654
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,455
<i>We know how bad we can be,</i>

655
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:11,453
<i>now you, the men</i>
<i>of Capricorn One,</i>

656
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:14,789
<i>have shown us how wonderful</i>
<i>we can be</i>

657
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:18,454
<i>by showing us how high</i>
<i>we can reach.</i>

658
00:37:19,712 --> 00:37:22,663
<i>You have crossed</i>
<i>the last great frontier</i>

659
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:25,328
<i>and you have shown us</i>
<i>what we are:</i>

660
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:26,832
<i>people.</i>

661
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:30,537
<i>Of different colors and religions</i>
<i>and ideologies,</i>

662
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:33,707
<i>however, a single people.</i>

663
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:36,995
<i>You are the basic truth in us.</i>

664
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,205
<i>You are the reality.</i>

665
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:42,917
<i>We will never let you down</i>

666
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:46,500
<i>and we will always be grateful."</i>

667
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:58,679
I have decided after
a careful deliberation

668
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:01,278
and a painful soul-searching
to give you an opportunity

669
00:38:01,314 --> 00:38:03,840
- to win your 50 dollars back.
- I don't feel like playing.

670
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:06,966
- Eight ball, five dollars a game.
- I don't feel like it.

671
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,471
- 10 dollars.
- I'm serious.

672
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:11,341
So am I. I'll even let you break.
Can a person be more serious?

673
00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:12,138
You're drunk.

674
00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:14,383
I knew there was a reason
I was feeling this good.

675
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:15,840
I need a drink.

676
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:19,133
Underneath that wash and wear shirt,
you have some heart.

677
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,420
It may be sanforized, but it's a heart.

678
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,255
Mike?

679
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,087
- You said I break.
- I musta been drunk.

680
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:48,088
- Hard day at the office, dear?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

681
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:51,719
- Did you break your slide rule?
- I'm not really sure.

682
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,808
I ran a check on my own
transmissions signals.

683
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:56,386
The numbers came up screwy,
so I told Dr. Bergen about it.

684
00:38:56,423 --> 00:38:58,673
It was like he was pissed at me
for running a check.

685
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,683
He said it must be a console
malfunctioning.

686
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,428
So I told Dr. Kelloway about it
and he said the same thing.

687
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:06,089
Big deal. What did you expect,
a merit badge?

688
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:08,713
I guess so.
They must know what they're doing.

689
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,596
Those numbers couldn't have been
right anyway. No way.

690
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,846
If you know the numbers
couldn't have been right,

691
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:15,090
why are you so upset?

692
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:18,055
It was the way they reacted.
No double check or anything.

693
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:20,884
They looked at me like I was a kid
and offered me a cookie.

694
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:23,678
- What were the numbers?
- I have to admit it is ridiculous.

695
00:39:23,972 --> 00:39:25,429
Good, let's play pool.

696
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:33,806
Those signals couldn't have
come from 300 miles.

697
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:34,967
Which signals?

698
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,637
The television transmission.

699
00:39:38,181 --> 00:39:41,348
I think I just sobered up. Would you
tell me what you just told me again?

700
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:43,220
<i>Hey, Caulfield, telephone.</i>

701
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,964
Hello?

702
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,723
yes, this is Caulfield.

703
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:55,720
What?

704
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,980
I'm sorry, you'll have to speak
more clearly.

705
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:02,180
I think we have a bad connection
or something. I can't hear you.

706
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:04,678
Who?

707
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:08,098
I don't understand what you want.

708
00:40:09,642 --> 00:40:11,939
Look, if you call the assignment desk,

709
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,547
they'll be glad to send someone over
to cover that for you.

710
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:17,761
Yes, ask for the assignment desk.

711
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,100
Assignment. That's right.

712
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:21,923
You're welcome.

713
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,383
Anybody hungry?

714
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:42,592
No.

715
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,675
Oh, the marvels of American
science.

716
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:51,137
Here we are, millions of miles
from the Earth

717
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:54,016
and we can still send out for a pizza.

718
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:56,520
I'm not gonna do it.

719
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,516
Not gonna do what?

720
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:01,068
Tomorrow, I'm not gonna sit
in this thing

721
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:03,807
and talk to my wife and tell her
everything is going fine.

722
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,519
I'm not gonna do it.

723
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:09,517
I tried.

724
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:14,520
I got two little kids with big bright eyes.

725
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:18,805
And I used to tell them their daddy
was gonna make them proud of him

726
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:21,646
like he was of them.

727
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,979
And now I gotta go home,

728
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,969
I gotta kiss them and
gotta look in their eyes

729
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:29,432
and tell them I really did this?

730
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:36,144
I don't know. Maybe that's better that
telling them I really didn't do it.

731
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:40,686
I wish I knew what was right.
I really don't.

732
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:44,312
We've been sitting around here for
months, telling their lies for them.

733
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:48,354
And I don't wanna do it any more.

734
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:52,817
<i>Okay, so we go and blow the whole</i>
<i>thing tomorrow, on national TV,</i>

735
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:53,847
<i>then what have we done?</i>

736
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:57,646
- We'd screw up a lotta people's dinner.
- We've already screwed ourselves.

737
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:00,739
Okay, so what do we accomplish
by screwing everybody else?

738
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:04,106
He's got a point there, you know.
We went along with this for you.

739
00:42:04,776 --> 00:42:06,269
You and our families.

740
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,440
Now you wanna go out in
some terrific blaze of glory?

741
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:13,274
And we get pulverized in the process?

742
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:17,896
And our families?

743
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,809
- What about our families?
- I know!

744
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:33,107
I know.

745
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:35,273
<i>Shit!</i>

746
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,529
<i>That's the best thing I've heard</i>
<i>anybody say in three weeks.</i>

747
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:40,237
<i>- What's the best thing?</i>
<i>- Shit.</i>

748
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:41,946
<i>I just don't think I can do it.</i>

749
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:43,403
Get me Dr. Kelloway.

750
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:46,196
Why, all of a sudden,
are we standing up for the bad guys

751
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:48,565
and you're on the side
of truth and justice?

752
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:50,898
We may have a problem with
Brubaker tomorrow.

753
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:54,570
- I wish I had the words.
- Damn the words, Bru!

754
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,860
These people... they're capable
of anything.

755
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:01,146
And we got our families out there.

756
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:04,612
Now, we're in this thing and I think
we're in too deep to stop now.

757
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:07,105
No one of us is gonna decide.

758
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:10,066
It's got to be all of us.

759
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:17,407
Operator, I'm trying a number now
for over an hour and it's busy.

760
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:19,896
Would you kindly check to see
if it's out of order?

761
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,780
I know you don't do that.

762
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:24,609
Yes, it's an emergency.

763
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:29,195
Thank you. 8733657.

764
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:33,322
No, 3657, Mr. Elliot Whitter.

765
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,195
Out of order?

766
00:43:42,117 --> 00:43:43,527
Thank you very much, operator.

767

773

<i>This is the first time the crew has</i>

Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

777

<i>Houston, do you have a picture?</i>

779
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:21,459
Roger, Capricorn, we have a picture.

780
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,447
We have three anxious ladies here
who would like to talk to you.

781
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,901
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

782
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,035
<i>We'd sure like to talk to them.</i>

783
00:44:28,163 --> 00:44:30,553
Okay, go ahead, but keep it short.

784
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,944
Remember, this is long distance.

785
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:34,611
Jack?

786
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,377
Jack, it's Betty.

787
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:40,281
<i>- Hey, Betty, how are you?</i>
- You look fine.

788
00:44:40,538 --> 00:44:44,579
<i>Thanks. You know we can't see you</i>
<i>up here, but you sure sound terrific.</i>

789
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,580
I miss you. So do the kids.

790
00:44:49,331 --> 00:44:51,736
<i>Okay, I miss them too,</i>
<i>more than you all know.</i>

791
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:53,744
Peter?

792
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,904
It's Sharon.

793
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:57,871
<i>I told you never to call me here.</i>

794
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:59,410
Are you feeling well?

795
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:01,112
<i>I'm feeling very well.</i>

796
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:02,867
<i>How's Sandy?</i>

797
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,166
Well, she's got the part of Wendy
in her school play.

798
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:07,636
They're doing Peter Pan.

799
00:45:07,673 --> 00:45:09,071
<i>That's terrific.</i>

800
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,248
You sound so close.

801
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,825
It's hard to believe you really are
that far away in space.

802
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,659
<i>It's hard for me to believe it, too.</i>

803
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,031
Bru?

804
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,155
<i>Hello, Kay.</i>

805
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:22,034
We're all so proud of you.

806
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,654
Can you hear me, Bru?

807
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:26,705
<i>Yes.</i>

808
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,364
- I'm not sure of Brubaker.
- Keep watching.

809
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:34,376
Bru? I have a surprise for you.

810
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:35,455
<i>What?</i>

811
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:39,950
I said I have a surprise for you.

812
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:41,491
<i>What is it?</i>

813
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:45,704
Charles wrote a composition in school
and he won an award.

814
00:45:46,419 --> 00:45:47,663
May I read it to you?

815
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:51,835
Bru, can you hear me?

816
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:53,331
<i>Yes...</i>

817
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,456
<i>please, read it to me.</i>

818
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,827
It doesn't look good.
Do I cut the transmission?

819
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:00,460
Not until I tell you.

820
00:46:00,795 --> 00:46:04,836
'My father, by Charles Brubaker, Jr.'

821
00:46:06,837 --> 00:46:09,326
'My father is far away from me now.

822
00:46:10,421 --> 00:46:11,795
He is flying to Mars.

823
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:13,996
<i>I miss him very much.</i>

824
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,792
<i>I always miss him when</i>
<i>he goes away.</i>

825
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:19,414
<i>I'm not sad, though.</i>

826
00:46:20,046 --> 00:46:22,203
<i>I used to be sad when</i>
<i>he went away.</i>

827
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:27,587
One day he told me that people
can't live only for themselves.

828
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:32,498
He said he was trying to do something
that would be good for everybody.

829
00:46:34,172 --> 00:46:37,585
<i>I know that is what</i>
he is doing now.

830
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:42,085
<i>He is doing something for</i>
<i>everybody, to give them a better life.</i>

831
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:45,787
<i>That means he is doing something</i>
<i>for me, too.</i>

832
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:48,913
So even though he is far away,

833
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:52,044
he is thinking about me
and I am with him.

834
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:55,707
That is why I'm not sad.

835
00:46:56,091 --> 00:46:58,378
That is why I'm so proud of my Dad.

836
00:46:58,591 --> 00:46:59,835
I love him so much.'

837
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:02,337
Kay.

838
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:05,541
What is it?

839
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:09,002
There's something I...

840
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,129
I wanna say.

841
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:14,624
<i>Bru?</i>

842
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:17,004
<i>What is it?</i>

843
00:47:19,134 --> 00:47:20,414
Not until I tell you.

844
00:47:21,176 --> 00:47:24,174
I know this hasn't been easy
for you and the kids.

845
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,794
I want you to know

846
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:31,172
I love you.

847
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:35,886
<i>Tell Charles thanks for</i>
<i>the composition, please.</i>

848
00:47:35,922 --> 00:47:36,750
I will.

849
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:38,629
Tell him when I get back,

850
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:44,043
I'm gonna take him to Yosemite again,

851
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:46,880
like last summer.

852
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:51,043
I will.

853
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:53,254
<i>And I want you to know</i>
<i>that I love you.</i>

854
00:47:54,554 --> 00:47:55,667
<i>Very much.</i>

855
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:00,715
Time's up, gentlemen.

856
00:48:01,304 --> 00:48:02,548
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

857
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:05,127
The next time we see you,
you'll be on the way home.

858
00:48:05,305 --> 00:48:07,675
<i>- Roger.</i>
- Well done, Capricorn.

859
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:42,172
Yes?

860
00:48:42,974 --> 00:48:45,214
Is Whitter in?
Tell him it's Caulfield.

861
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:47,719
- Who?
- Whitter. Elliot Whitter.

862
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:50,662
There's no one here by that name.

863
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:52,355
You must have the wrong apartment.

864
00:48:52,392 --> 00:48:54,715
Well, this is apartment 228,
isn't it?

865
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:58,059
Yeah. Oh, you probably have
the wrong building.

866
00:48:58,095 --> 00:48:59,814
You know, they are all sorta look alike.

867
00:48:59,851 --> 00:49:03,466
Yeah, that's right.
This is 4311 Claridge, isn't it?

868
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,065
Yeah, it is.

869
00:49:05,101 --> 00:49:09,095
Elliot Whitter lives at 4311 Claridge,
in apartment 228.

870
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,173
Is this a joke?

871
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:13,565
Look, I've been here a million times.

872
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:16,090
Elliot's a friend of mine and
he lives in this apartment!

873
00:49:16,477 --> 00:49:19,558
Look, Mister..., whoever you are.
I'm cleaning an oven.

874
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:22,969
It's my oven. It's in my kitchen.
In my apartment.

875
00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:25,150
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to it.

876
00:49:25,186 --> 00:49:28,811
Wait a minute! Just wait! Look, I'm not
a crazy person and I'm not a mugger!

877
00:49:28,848 --> 00:49:31,788
I'm looking for my friend and he lives
in this apartment! I swear it!

878
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:34,728
Would you get your foot out of my door
or I'm gonna call the police!

879
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:36,442
Now I don't think this is
funny any more!

880
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:39,477
Wait. I can prove I've been here before.
I know this apartment.

881
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,855
Now, will you get outta here,
or do I have to call the police?

00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:31,240
<i>Inboard thrusters.</i>

906
00:53:31,747 --> 00:53:34,034
<i>- Inboard thrusters on.</i>
- How we doin'?

907
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,169
We might have a slight problem, sir.

908
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:38,741
- What is it?
- They're a little bit off target.

909
00:53:39,956 --> 00:53:40,951
How far off?

910
00:53:47,373 --> 00:53:50,076
- As much as 200 miles.
- That far?

911
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,322
It could take up to 1.30 hour for
the recovery forces to reach them.

912
00:53:55,582 --> 00:53:57,541
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

913
00:53:57,577 --> 00:53:58,453
Six...

914
00:53:58,708 --> 00:53:59,702
five...

915
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:01,788
four...
three...

916
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,156
two...

917
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:09,033
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

918
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:12,084
Capricorn One, we show red
on the heat shield.

919
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,079
<i>Do you copy?</i>

920
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,881
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

921
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:18,323
We show red on the heat shield.
Do you read?

922
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:20,756
<i>Capricorn One, this is Houston.</i>

923
00:54:20,793 --> 00:54:24,376
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
We show red on the heat shield.

924
00:54:24,413 --> 00:54:25,703
Do you copy?

925
00:54:27,793 --> 00:54:29,701
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

926
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:34,409
Capricorn One, we show red on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

927
00:54:36,294 --> 00:54:38,368
- Capricorn One...
- That is, Kelloway.

928
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:42,705
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Do you read?

929
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:47,869
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

930
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:52,704
Capricorn One, we show red on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

931
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,415
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

932
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:02,243
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

933
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:05,042
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

934
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:09,872
Capricorn, we show red light on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

935
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:13,829
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

936
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,302
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,</i>
<i>Capricorn Control.</i>

937
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,678
<i>We are advised that there appears</i>
<i>to be a malfunction.</i>

938
00:55:19,714 --> 00:55:22,464
<i>We do not know what the problem</i>
<i>is. We will keep you advised.</i>

939
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:24,123
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

940
00:55:24,464 --> 00:55:26,178
Charles, take Sandy and go inside.

941
00:55:26,215 --> 00:55:28,506
- Mom, what's...
- Charles, go inside now!

942
00:55:28,543 --> 00:55:30,544
- Mom...
- Charles, I said right now!

943
00:55:37,757 --> 00:55:39,914
<i>Capricorn One, this is Houston.</i>

944
00:56:05,384 --> 00:56:08,217
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a brief statement

945
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:10,922
and then I will answer
your questions.

946
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,627
It must have been re-entry.

947
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:16,667
Something went wrong
during re-entry.

948
00:56:16,927 --> 00:56:18,724
Why haven't they told us anything?

949
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,719
They don't want us to know
what went wrong.

950
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:21,724
What went wrong?

951
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:25,126
- Who the hell is Kelloway?
- Where the hell are we?

952
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:31,965
At T-plus 259 days 15 hours, 11 minutes,
in the flight of Capricorn One,

953
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:37,175
which is 2 minutes. 18 seconds.
after interface,

954
00:56:38,387 --> 00:56:43,424
the heat shield light on the Mission
Control monitoring panel turned red.

955
00:56:44,179 --> 00:56:45,209
We...

956
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:48,710
are dead.

957
00:56:49,554 --> 00:56:51,095
- What?
- We're dead.

958
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,587
Shit, I was such a terrific guy!

959
00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:58,296
We tried to establish radio contract,
contact with the spacecraft

960
00:56:58,597 --> 00:57:00,060
an we were unsuccessful.

961
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:03,510
It landed off course.
Why haven't they said anything to us?

962
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:07,760
And if it never landed,
either the heat shield separated

963
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:10,177
or the chutes never opened.

964
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:11,882
Either way, we are dead.

965
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:16,098
The heat shield evidently separated
from the Command Module

966
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:18,614
and, as you know, the heat shield

967
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:21,093
is the only protection the Module has

968
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:25,467
against the heat build-up on
the re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

969
00:57:26,182 --> 00:57:31,054
The spacecraft disintegrated within 12
seconds. after the loss of the heat shield.

970
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:34,158
Right now Kelloway is making
a speech

971
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:36,883
about what brave, wonderful guys...

972
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:38,428
we were.

973
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,847
I cannot adequately describe
how we feel.

974
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:46,676
These men were an integral
of the family...

975
00:57:48,351 --> 00:57:49,678
here in the program.

976
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:53,223
If anybody ever sees us again,
the whole thing falls apart.

977
00:57:53,518 --> 00:57:56,053
It's as simple as that.
They can't have us around.

978
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,347
That is the end of my statement.

979
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,691
- Have you spoken to the families?
- Yes.

980
00:58:04,727 --> 00:58:07,473
I don't know how we have
a lotta choice in this matter.

981
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,220
I say we get the hell outta here.
Anybody disagree?

982
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:20,049
When was the last time the heat shield
was checked?

983
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:27,052
All during the re-entry phase there
were a series of status checks.

984
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:31,930
All of them gave us every indication
the shield was in place.

985
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,723
No, I have not spoken to the President
yet, but I'm sure I will very soon.

986
00:58:51,106 --> 00:58:53,111
I'd like to say that
the President has been

987
00:58:53,148 --> 00:58:58,303
a constant source of encouragement
to all of us in the program.

988
00:58:58,565 --> 00:59:02,511
This mission meant as much
to him as it did to us.

989
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:10,684
Do you think this will end
the Manned Space Program?

990
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:13,430
I don't know.

991
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:21,728
You can't reach that far without
stumbling somewhere along the way.

992
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:27,858
That doesn't mean that your goal
isn't worthwhile.

993
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,939
So many people have given so much.

994
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:36,978
In 1967 we had the Apollo One fire.

995
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:45,515
But we didn't just...

996
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,233
give up even though we were crushed.

997
01:00:02,403 --> 01:00:04,726
We went on as they would have
wanted us to.

998
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:20,451
Now, these three remarkable men

999
01:00:20,488 --> 01:00:23,688
have given their lives in an effort to...

1000
01:00:24,113 --> 01:00:26,566
widen the horizons of their species.

1001
01:00:42,615 --> 01:00:44,736
They died striving for a goal.

1002
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:04,068
You tell me.

1003
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:10,653
I ask you... I ask all of you here.
You be the ones to tell me.

1004
01:01:10,992 --> 01:01:14,073
How could we best serve these men?

1005
01:01:16,242 --> 01:01:18,198
<i>By giving up on their dream?</i>

1006
01:01:19,326 --> 01:01:20,902
<i>By saying that</i>

1007
01:01:21,784 --> 01:01:23,491
<i>it was all for nothing?</i>

1008
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:29,658
<i>You give me the answer.</i>

1009
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:33,982
- That was the left gear we lost.
- See if you can retract the other one.

1010
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:39,698
- Do you have any idea where we are?
- No.

1011
01:01:40,244 --> 01:01:41,654
Which direction are we headed?

1012
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:45,196
West. Once we hit the coast,
we'll go North.

1013
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:48,659
All we've got to do is get to any city,
any place there are people,

1014
01:01:49,495 --> 01:01:52,209
a newspaper, a television station.

1015
01:01:52,245 --> 01:01:55,162
Any place we can show up and
be seen. Then it's over.

1016
01:01:55,198 --> 01:01:57,209
I'm not sure it's exactly over.

1017
01:01:57,245 --> 01:02:00,113
Our families, our kids.
They think we're dead.

1018
01:02:01,162 --> 01:02:02,442
I wonder,

1019
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:05,365
when we show up,
when everybody finds up,

1020
01:02:06,204 --> 01:02:07,911
I wonder if they'll be happy.

1021
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:11,825
Maybe it'd be better for them
if we were dead.

1022
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,990
Oh, Christ!

1023
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:20,656
Fuel! There's no Goddamn fuel!

1024
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:24,331
I told you never to take a trip
without checking the tank.

1025
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:26,998
- What about the reserve?
- We're on reserve.

1026
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:29,236
That's great.

1027
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:33,284
I'll start to circle.
See if you can find a lever area.

1028
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,405
There.

1029
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,580
Over there, beyond those cliffs.

1030
01:02:40,207 --> 01:02:42,198
Are you sure you know
how to land this thing?

1031
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:45,446
Full flaps.

1032
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:43,961
I think we're on Mars.

1033
01:03:44,171 --> 01:03:46,457
We got about 20 minutes.
head start on them.

1034
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:49,200
It's not gonna be hard to spot
this plane from the air.

1035
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:50,993
We got two choices,

1036
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:54,421
either we stick together, or we split up
and go in different directions.

1037
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,827
Hey, I just found a survival kit in here.

1038
01:04:04,172 --> 01:04:05,795
There's a can of water each.

1039
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:10,297
A flare each.

1040
01:04:14,173 --> 01:04:17,256
John, you take the flint.
Peter and I'll split up the matches.

1041
01:04:17,293 --> 01:04:18,753
Anybody want the gun?

1042
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,214
I'd shoot my foot.

1043
01:04:21,382 --> 01:04:22,709
I'd shoot his foot.

1044
01:04:29,424 --> 01:04:31,083
You can take the knife.

1045
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:36,388
Remember, if any of us gets caught,

1046
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:38,795
or he can't make it,
shoot off a flare,

1047
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,799
so the others'll know.

1048
01:04:42,175 --> 01:04:45,671
I'll continue West. John, you go North.
Peter, you go South.

1049
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,722
We came from the East,

1050
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,750
so we know that's the wrong way.

1051
01:04:50,342 --> 01:04:51,919
There's not a lotta time.

1052
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:54,500
There's too much to say, so let's go.

1053
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:57,835
If any of us makes it...

1054
01:04:59,176 --> 01:05:00,006
Well...

1055
01:05:02,552 --> 01:05:05,635
Did I ever tell you the one about
the guy who had a job giving enemas

1056
01:05:05,672 --> 01:05:06,879
to elephants, and?

1057
01:05:09,802 --> 01:05:10,797
Thanks.

1058
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:17,505
Did you ever hear it?

1059
01:05:18,178 --> 01:05:20,216
You can tell me about it
when we get home.

1060
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:43,422
<i>Tell Charles that...</i>

1061
01:05:44,555 --> 01:05:47,423
<i>thank him for the composition,</i>
<i>please.</i>

1062
01:05:49,847 --> 01:05:50,842
<i>I...</i>

1063
01:05:53,181 --> 01:05:55,136
<i>Well, tell him when I get back...</i>

1064
01:05:56,598 --> 01:05:59,512
<i>I'm gonna take him to</i>
<i>Yosemite again,</i>

1065
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,097
<i>like last summer.</i>

1066
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,094
<i>- I will.</i>
- Right there. Run it again.

1067
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:17,050
<i>Like last summer.</i>

1068
01:06:25,517 --> 01:06:26,512
<i>I will.</i>

1069
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,637
'Look, sir. Look, sir.

1070
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:36,721
Mr. Knox, sir, let's do tricks
with bricks and blocks, sir.

1071
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:39,974
Let's do tricks
with chicks and clocks, sir.'

1072
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:42,596
- Blocks! Look, blocks!
- Right.

1073
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:45,352
There are the blocks
and those are the...

1074
01:06:45,388 --> 01:06:47,482
- Clocks!
- Right.

1075
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:50,227
'First, I'll make a quick trick,
brick stack.

1076
01:06:50,263 --> 01:06:53,307
Then I'll make a quick trick,
block stack.

1077
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:56,222
You can make a quick trick,
chick stack.

1078
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:59,102
You can make a quick trick,
clock stack.

1079
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:01,552
- Chicks!
- And?

1080
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:02,800
Clocks!

1081
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:08,676
'And here's a new trick,
Mr. Knox.

1082
01:07:09,187 --> 01:07:12,553
Socks on chicks
and chicks on fox.

1083
01:07:15,021 --> 01:07:18,433
Fox on clocks,
on bricks and blocks.

1084
01:07:19,646 --> 01:07:23,142
Bricks and blocks
on fox and box.

1085
01:07:28,397 --> 01:07:30,222
Now we come to

1086
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:33,520
ticks and tocks, sir.

1087
01:07:37,356 --> 01:07:39,014
Try to say this,

1088
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:42,063
Mr. Knox, sir,

1089
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:45,512
clocks...

1090
01:07:46,648 --> 01:07:48,603
clocks on fix tick,

1091
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,561
clocks on Knox tock.

1092
01:07:52,399 --> 01:07:53,477
Clocks!

1093
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:55,289
Clocks!

1094
01:07:55,326 --> 01:07:56,305
Clocks.

1095
01:07:57,857 --> 01:07:59,647
Right, Sandy, very good.

1096
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:04,812
'Six, sick,

1097
01:08:06,191 --> 01:08:07,269
bricks,

1098
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:09,472
tick...'

1099
01:09:21,114 --> 01:09:21,744
Yes?

1100
01:09:21,781 --> 01:09:24,613
I'd like to see Mrs. Brubaker.
My name is Caulfield.

1101
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:26,745
Mrs. Brubaker isn't seeing
anyone.

1102
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:29,732
I telephoned this morning.
I believe I'm expected.

1103
01:09:30,073 --> 01:09:33,240
- What was that name again?
- Caulfield. Robert Caulfield.

1104
01:09:33,276 --> 01:09:35,526
Oh, yes. Mrs. Brubaker
is expecting you.

1105
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:38,074
She's out on the patio.
It's right through there.

1106
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:38,938
Thank you

1107
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:50,396
- Mrs. Brubaker?
- Mr. Caulfield?

1108
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:52,651
Sit down, please.

1109
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,405
Mrs. Brubaker, first of all,

1110
01:10:02,659 --> 01:10:05,039
I'd like to say I'm really sorry.

1111
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,529
- Everyone is sor...
- I know, and I appreciate it.

1112
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:12,574
Don't be too uncomfortable with me.
I couldn't put up with that right now.

1113
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,444
I understand that you think
you're interrupting me,

1114
01:10:17,077 --> 01:10:20,407
and you are,
but I welcome the interruption.

1115
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:23,695
You called and said it was something
important. What is it?

1116
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:26,916
Mrs. Brubaker, it may not be
important to you.

1117
01:10:26,952 --> 01:10:29,951
I'm looking for something that may be
important to me. It's personal.

1118
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,375
You're a reporter, aren't you?

1119
01:10:32,411 --> 01:10:35,030
Yes, as I told you,
I'm not looking for an interview.

1120
01:10:35,536 --> 01:10:37,333
I would like to ask you
a few questions

1121
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,866
about the last time you spoke with
your husband after the landing.

1122
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,317
What about it?

1123
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:47,776
Well, this may sound strange, Mrs.
Brubaker, don't be upset with me.

1124
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:51,365
Just before the conversation ended,

1125
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:55,210
Colonel Brubaker told you something
about going on a vacation

1126
01:10:55,246 --> 01:10:59,038
and your reaction was like you didn't
understand what he was saying.

1127
01:10:59,075 --> 01:11:00,745
Why would you wanna know
about that?

1128
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:03,244
As I told you, it's something personal.

1129
01:11:04,122 --> 01:11:05,531
It's personal to me, too.

1130
01:11:05,664 --> 01:11:08,781
Please, I'm not trying to embarrass you
or anyone else.

1131
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:12,456
Why would any of this be
your business?

1132
01:11:12,492 --> 01:11:13,865
Please, trust me.

1133
01:11:14,915 --> 01:11:15,993
Why?

1134
01:11:17,081 --> 01:11:19,238
You ask really good questions.

1135
01:11:24,124 --> 01:11:25,830
Well, it's all so silly.

1136
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:28,372
It wasn't anything that dramatic.

1137
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:30,621
Bru just forgot something, that's all.

1138
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:35,868
I don't see the purpose in broadcasting
that my husband mistook a vacation

1139
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,797
when he had so many other things
to think about.

1140
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:41,238
No, no, no, I'm not looking for
anything to broadcast.

1141
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,747
- What are you looking for?
- It has to do with a friend of mine.

1142
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:49,955
- Is there something I should know?
- If there was anything, I would tell you.

1143
01:11:53,793 --> 01:11:55,167
Well, it's nothing.

1144
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:59,076
Bru said that he wanted to go back
to Yosemite like last year.

1145
01:11:59,626 --> 01:12:02,032
Last year, we went to Flat Rock,
not Yosemite.

1146
01:12:02,335 --> 01:12:05,037
I don't think there's any cosmic
significance in that.

1147
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:10,523
Mrs. Brubaker, I truly thank you.

1148
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,383
I'm sure you had better things to do

1149
01:12:12,419 --> 01:12:14,939
than put up with a bunch of
stupid questions.

1150
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:17,459
No, I didn't.
Have I been any help to you at all?

1151
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:20,201
I don't know.
May I call you again, sometime?

1152
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:21,707
Yes.

1153
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:50,294
Yes?

1154
01:12:56,006 --> 01:12:57,499
There's no one inside?

1155
01:12:58,798 --> 01:12:59,579
Are you sure?

1156
01:13:04,632 --> 01:13:07,416
Get more personnel,
they can't go too far on foot.

1157
01:13:26,508 --> 01:13:27,835
Oh, a piece of cake.

1158
01:15:33,602 --> 01:15:36,802
Charles, cut it out.
You know you're bothering her.

1159
01:15:37,019 --> 01:15:39,970
I know you're bothering her and
she knows you're bothering her.

1160
01:15:40,185 --> 01:15:42,306
If you want to stay in the pool,
cut it out.

1161
01:15:50,936 --> 01:15:53,141
- Hi, Uncle Jim.
- Hello there, Charles.

1162
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,929
- Hello, Kay.
- Jim.

1163
01:16:03,187 --> 01:16:04,680
You look just fine.

1164
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:05,974
Thank you.

1165
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,188
Can I offer you something to drink?

1166
01:16:09,224 --> 01:16:10,515
No, thank you.

1167
01:16:12,188 --> 01:16:13,894
- How are the children?
- Fine.

1168
01:16:14,772 --> 01:16:16,312
Charles is strong.

1169
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:19,683
He's very much to himself,
but he's strong.

1170
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:22,058
Sandy doesn't know.

1171
01:16:25,772 --> 01:16:30,564
There's gonna be a Memorial Service
on Tuesday, right here, in Houston.

1172
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:32,602
President... The President'll be here.

1173
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:35,179
- He's going to speak.
- That's nice.

1174
01:16:35,732 --> 01:16:37,390
Will I get a folded flag?

1175
01:16:38,357 --> 01:16:40,015
I would like you to be there.

1176
01:16:41,357 --> 01:16:42,471
Please.

1177
01:16:43,315 --> 01:16:46,646
I know how difficult everything is
for you right now.

1178
01:16:46,941 --> 01:16:50,271
I feel like Jack the Ripper even
asking you... It's just that...

1179
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:55,058
it would be good for everyone
if you could go with me to the service.

1180
01:16:56,858 --> 01:17:00,141
- It's a horrible way to die.
- No, absolutely not.

1181
01:17:02,275 --> 01:17:06,281
When the heat shield separated,
it was over in less than 5 seconds.

1182
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:11,189
I know that sounds grizzly, but you just
have to know he never suffered.

1183
01:17:12,109 --> 01:17:14,479
He died doing what he wanted to do.

1184
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:17,985
Something he felt was important
enough to die for.

1185
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:19,229
I know, I know.

1186
01:17:20,693 --> 01:17:23,526
I don't think it was important enough
for him to die for.

1187
01:17:24,777 --> 01:17:25,891
I understand.

1188
01:17:27,736 --> 01:17:29,699
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1189
01:17:29,736 --> 01:17:34,440
I have no right to intrude on you
like this. I'll call you tomorrow.

1190
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:40,225
Jim!

1191
01:17:40,945 --> 01:17:42,189
I'll go.

1192
01:17:46,404 --> 01:17:48,194
You're a very special woman.

1193
01:17:48,696 --> 01:17:50,485
He was a very special man.

1194
01:17:52,029 --> 01:17:53,107
Thank you.

1195
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,195
- Hey, Uncle Jim!
- Yes?

1196
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:02,319
- My Dad went to Mars.
- Yes! Yes, he did!

1197
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:15,563
Oh, I'm dehydrating.

1198
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:19,989
Dehydrating.

1199
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:23,187
Sign.

1200
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,816
Manual says...

1201
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,198
look for signs.

1202
01:18:32,532 --> 01:18:33,646
Water.

1203
01:18:34,991 --> 01:18:36,567
Manual says...

1204
01:18:37,783 --> 01:18:39,441
signs for water.

1205
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:02,111
Oh, dried river bed.

1206
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,023
Signs.

1207
01:19:05,993 --> 01:19:07,321
Bend in the river.

1208
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,944
Lower signs.

1209
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:13,321
Bend in the river.

1210
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:19,233
There's just...

1211
01:19:21,786 --> 01:19:22,865
Water.

1212
01:19:23,828 --> 01:19:26,399
River bed.

1213
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:34,990
Water.

1214
01:19:38,788 --> 01:19:40,825
A drink of water.

1215
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:51,700
Elizabeth, there's no water.

1216
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,116
There's no water.

1217
01:19:55,956 --> 01:19:57,579
I wanna die.

1218
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,867
Elizabeth.

1219
01:20:13,415 --> 01:20:14,363
Birds.

1220
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,409
Elizabeth,

1221
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,327
birds.

1222
01:20:20,999 --> 01:20:22,741
I got to get the birds.

1223
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:35,989
Helicopters...

1224
01:21:38,464 --> 01:21:39,412
Yes?

1225
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:43,672
He was alone?

1226
01:21:45,506 --> 01:21:48,042
Which direction was he heading
from the airplane?

1227
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,625
Aah, look South and West only.

1228
01:21:55,882 --> 01:21:58,714
Call everybody off North and East.

1229
01:21:59,049 --> 01:22:01,668
The other two are South and West.

1230
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,207
- Hello, again.
- Hello, again.

1231
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:12,632
- Can I offer you something to drink?
- Yes, thank you.

1232
01:22:12,669 --> 01:22:16,048
- What would you like?
- Some scotch. Straight, please.

1233
01:22:17,092 --> 01:22:19,050
You haven't found what
you're looking for,

1234
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:20,972
you're embarrassed about
bothering me again,

1235
01:22:21,009 --> 01:22:24,092
however there were one or two
questions more you'd like to ask me.

1236
01:22:24,129 --> 01:22:27,126
It's something personal and
you won't bother me any more.

1237
01:22:28,301 --> 01:22:32,793
I haven't found what I'm looking for.
I feel embarrassed about bothering you.

1238
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:36,760
However, there are one or two more
questions I'd like to ask you.

1239
01:22:36,797 --> 01:22:39,593
It's something personal and
I won't bother you any more.

1240
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,795
You're up to something, want my help
and you won't tell me what it is. Why?

1241
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,667
You're a very smart lady,
you know that.

1242
01:22:48,303 --> 01:22:49,132
Yes.

1243
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:51,207
I drink too much.

1244
01:22:51,928 --> 01:22:54,499
I get in trouble a lot because
I talk too much.

1245
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:58,626
Sometimes I have an imagination
that's a bit too vivid.

1246
01:23:00,429 --> 01:23:02,715
Something's wrong and
I don't know what it is.

1247
01:23:03,221 --> 01:23:07,677
Believe me, I would never do anything
to harm you or your husband, I swear.

1248
01:23:10,013 --> 01:23:11,257
What are you after?

1249
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:17,727
I'm taking a terrible risk telling you this.

1250
01:23:17,763 --> 01:23:21,010
You may throw me out of here and
I do not want to be thrown out.

1251
01:23:22,889 --> 01:23:26,306
I don't think your husband is the kind
of man who makes mistakes,

1252
01:23:26,342 --> 01:23:28,261
no matter how far away he may be.

1253
01:23:28,889 --> 01:23:30,845
I think he was trying
to tell you something.

1254
01:23:32,014 --> 01:23:34,633
- What?
- What did you do at Flat Rock?

1255
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:41,254
Nothing much.

1256
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,932
We came home after one day
because Charles got sick.

1257
01:23:44,969 --> 01:23:47,474
- What'd you do that one day?
- I don't remember.

1258
01:23:49,516 --> 01:23:52,384
We took a tour of the town.
They have those tours.

1259
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:54,256
And...

1260
01:23:56,058 --> 01:23:57,551
I don't remember what.

1261
01:23:57,891 --> 01:24:00,215
- We took some home movies.
- Do you have them?

1262
01:24:00,517 --> 01:24:02,342
- Yes.
- May I see them?

1263
01:24:02,975 --> 01:24:03,804
Yes.

1264
01:24:07,892 --> 01:24:10,298
They were making a movie
the day we were there.

1265
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:12,724
Bru got a big kick out of it.

1266
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,266
He never knew it took so much time
to just do one simple scene.

1267
01:24:18,476 --> 01:24:21,935
Charles loves that one.
He wasn't in the greatest mood.

1268
01:24:21,972 --> 01:24:23,641
He didn't know it but he was sick.

1269
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,635
Bru was fascinated with the detail.

1270
01:24:29,561 --> 01:24:33,341
He couldn't get over how something
so fake could look so real.

1271
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:38,303
He kept on saying that with
that kind of technology

1272
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,591
you could convince people
of almost anything.

1273
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:46,221
There's this guy, you see!

1274
01:24:46,395 --> 01:24:48,102
He takes a trip to Europe.

1275
01:24:50,146 --> 01:24:51,852
It's his first vacation

1276
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:53,681
in a long time.

1277
01:24:55,146 --> 01:24:56,852
He sees the sights, you know?

1278
01:25:01,272 --> 01:25:02,848
He has a real good time.

1279
01:25:06,022 --> 01:25:07,100
Anyway,

1280
01:25:07,564 --> 01:25:10,017
after a while he decides to call home.

1281
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:14,892
He get his brother on the phone
and the guy says to his brother,

1282
01:25:15,481 --> 01:25:16,974
'How's everything at home?'

1283
01:25:17,939 --> 01:25:19,480
And his brother says,

1284
01:25:29,565 --> 01:25:31,106
'Your... Your cat died.'

1285
01:25:32,232 --> 01:25:34,057
And the guy says to his brother,

1286
01:25:34,191 --> 01:25:36,858
'You shouldn't tell me
bad news like that.'

1287
01:25:37,274 --> 01:25:38,353
'You should

1288
01:25:41,233 --> 01:25:42,975
break it to me gently.

1289
01:25:44,525 --> 01:25:45,555
You know...

1290
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:53,108
You should say something like,

1291
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:58,441
'The cat crawled out on the roof

1292
01:26:00,776 --> 01:26:02,566
and the was chasing the squirrels

1293
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:05,355
and...

1294
01:26:06,818 --> 01:26:08,062
he got stuck.

1295
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:10,518
We had to call the fire department

1296
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:14,186
and when they finally got there,
a fireman crawled up,

1297
01:26:14,611 --> 01:26:16,074
he grabbed the cat

1298
01:26:16,111 --> 01:26:20,567
and on the way down he slipped
and the cat fell to the ground.'

1299
01:26:35,196 --> 01:26:37,435
'They had to take the cat to the vet.

1300
01:26:42,863 --> 01:26:44,569
They tried to save the cat.

1301
01:26:47,738 --> 01:26:49,231
They even operated

1302
01:26:49,822 --> 01:26:50,935
on the cat.

1303
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:54,023
But it was too late.

1304
01:26:57,447 --> 01:26:58,727
They couldn't

1305
01:27:00,156 --> 01:27:01,317
save the cat.'

1306
01:27:04,656 --> 01:27:06,315
That's how you should break

1307
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,233
bad news, like that.'

1308
01:27:13,365 --> 01:27:15,522
So the guy says to his brother,

1309
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:21,736
'How's Mom?'

1310
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,109
And the brother says,

1311
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:32,741
'She's on the roof.

1312
01:27:49,076 --> 01:27:50,273
Get it?

1313
01:27:50,827 --> 01:27:52,236
She's on the roof.

1314
01:27:59,452 --> 01:28:00,910
She's on the roof.

1315
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:03,774
Get it?'

1316
01:28:34,622 --> 01:28:35,570
Yes?

1317
01:28:37,539 --> 01:28:38,736
Which one?

1318
01:28:41,622 --> 01:28:43,329
What direction was he going?

1319
01:28:46,539 --> 01:28:49,987
Brubaker is going West.
Put everybody West.

1320
01:29:01,582 --> 01:29:02,577
Caulfield.

1321
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:04,238
Right now?

1322
01:29:04,457 --> 01:29:05,536
Okay.

1323
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,797
How nice of you to join us here!

1324
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:21,536
- Listen, I think I got something.
- You need a dermatologist?

1325
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:23,119
Don't tell me, I'll get it.

1326
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:25,584
- George Raft! Right?
- Where the hell have you been?

1327
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:26,673
I have to talk to you.

1328
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:29,918
I think I'm onto something. It could be
your actual ball game. I mean it.

1329
01:29:29,954 --> 01:29:32,204
Golly, gee, Scoop, that sounds
very interesting!

1330
01:29:32,418 --> 01:29:34,048
Something is wrong. Something big.

1331
01:29:34,085 --> 01:29:36,210
They know I'm onto it and
they tried to kill me.

1332
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,832
- Who's they?
- I can't tell you.

1333
01:29:37,868 --> 01:29:39,418
- Why not?
- You wouldn't believe me.

1334
01:29:39,455 --> 01:29:40,532
You don't think so?

1335
01:29:41,044 --> 01:29:43,127
Okay, listen to me.
I got a tip from a friend,

1336
01:29:43,164 --> 01:29:44,836
a good friend, then he disappeared.

1337
01:29:44,872 --> 01:29:45,799
Disappeared?

1338
01:29:45,836 --> 01:29:49,086
Like he never existed. There's some
lady living in his apartment.

1339
01:29:49,122 --> 01:29:50,633
His apartment is all different.

1340
01:29:50,669 --> 01:29:53,086
She said she's been living there
for more than a year.

1341
01:29:53,123 --> 01:29:54,925
I checked the building rental office.

1342
01:29:54,961 --> 01:29:57,420
They have receipts from her
for more than a year.

1343
01:29:57,456 --> 01:29:58,717
I checked NASA personnel.

1344
01:29:58,753 --> 01:30:01,420
They have no record
my friend ever worked there.

1345
01:30:01,457 --> 01:30:03,129
They say they never even heard
of him.

1346
01:30:03,165 --> 01:30:04,301
So this friend of yours,

1347
01:30:04,337 --> 01:30:07,093
who works at NASA,
gives you a tip, then disappears.

1348
01:30:07,129 --> 01:30:10,588
And it turns out that he never lived in
his apartment or worked at NASA.

1349
01:30:10,624 --> 01:30:13,254
This is the guy that gave you the tip
on your cosmic scoop,

1350
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,213
- and you think I won't believe you?
- My car!

1351
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:16,760
Someone tampered
with my car!

1352
01:30:16,796 --> 01:30:18,593
The one you decided to go
swimming with?

1353
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:20,797
They did something to it!
I couldn't stop it!

1354
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:21,910
Can you prove that?

1355
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:25,504
The police said...

1356
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:30,714
- They said that nothing was wrong.
- And you think I won't believe you.

1357
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:32,089
Somebody took a shot at me!

1358
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,386
- When?
- Yesterday.

1359
01:30:33,423 --> 01:30:36,207
- Thank God, I've got an alibi!
- I'm telling you the truth!

1360
01:30:37,048 --> 01:30:39,667
Listen to me and listen good.

1361
01:30:41,548 --> 01:30:44,630
I don't like you, Caulfield.
You're ambitious.

1362
01:30:45,007 --> 01:30:48,455
You think the way to get ahead is to
come up with the scoop of the century.

1363
01:30:48,674 --> 01:30:52,138
Woodward and Bernstein were good
reporters. That's how they did it.

1364
01:30:52,174 --> 01:30:55,670
Not by telling me they've located
Patty Hearst three times, like you did.

1365
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:59,472
Or that brilliant piece of investigative
journalism you pulled off,

1366
01:30:59,508 --> 01:31:03,133
by finding an eyewitness to the 2nd
gunman in the Kennedy assassination.

1367
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:06,759
The small fact that the man had been
in a mental institution at the time,

1368
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:09,294
never deterred you,
not Scoop Caulfield!

1369
01:31:10,884 --> 01:31:14,140
Now, most reporters are like me.
They are plodders.

1370
01:31:14,176 --> 01:31:18,217
They spend a lot of their time checking
little things..., like facts.

1371
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:21,591
They cover mundane stories
like wars,

1372
01:31:22,052 --> 01:31:23,592
and trials and hearings.

1373
01:31:24,218 --> 01:31:27,219
You never seem to have enough time
in your busy schedule

1374
01:31:27,255 --> 01:31:30,170
to stoop so low as to cover a story.

1375
01:31:30,552 --> 01:31:34,433
You occupy your time with tips from
people who never existed,

1376
01:31:34,469 --> 01:31:38,095
driving your car into water and then
claiming it wasn't your fault,

1377
01:31:38,131 --> 01:31:40,050
getting shot at by unseen gunmen.

1378
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,239
Now, I really hate to interrupt
your meteoric career

1379
01:31:44,275 --> 01:31:47,759
with something so plebeian
as a legitimate story.

1380
01:31:48,095 --> 01:31:49,126
However,

1381
01:31:49,429 --> 01:31:52,393
a trainload of propane gas
had the bad taste

1382
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:56,553
to derail near Galveston and there's
a whole town that just might blow up.

1383
01:31:57,138 --> 01:31:59,810
So it would be just really
peachy or you

1384
01:31:59,846 --> 01:32:03,222
if you would join you film crew
that's waiting for you on the plane

1385
01:32:03,258 --> 01:32:05,129
at this very moment while we speak.

1386
01:32:06,305 --> 01:32:08,296
- That was a speech.
- I thought so.

1387
01:32:08,764 --> 01:32:11,222
I cannot go to Galveston right now.

1388
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:12,336
I don't think I heard you.

1389
01:32:13,014 --> 01:32:13,927
Look,

1390
01:32:14,222 --> 01:32:17,311
when a reporter tells
his Assignment Editor

1391
01:32:17,348 --> 01:32:20,963
that he thinks he may be onto
something that could be really big,

1392
01:32:21,181 --> 01:32:23,473
the Assignment Editor's suppose
to say,

1393
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,062
'You got forty-eight hours, kid,

1394
01:32:25,098 --> 01:32:26,932
and you better come up
with something good

1395
01:32:26,968 --> 01:32:28,145
or it's gonna be your neck.'

1396
01:32:28,182 --> 01:32:30,640
That's what he's supposed to say!
I saw it in a movie!

1397
01:32:30,677 --> 01:32:32,200
Get your ass on that plane!

1398
01:32:32,236 --> 01:32:33,687
I can't! I have to follow this!

1399
01:32:33,724 --> 01:32:36,412
And you can't tell me what this
earth-shattering story is?

1400
01:32:36,448 --> 01:32:39,099
It sounds too crazy.
If I told you, I'd be in more trouble.

1401
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:42,058
You're not crazy! I'm crazy!
I'm crazy for listening!

1402
01:32:42,094 --> 01:32:44,480
And I'm crazy for saying what
I'm about to say!

1403
01:32:44,516 --> 01:32:46,980
I'll give you twenty-four hours
come up with something!

1404
01:32:47,017 --> 01:32:50,299
Not forty-eight! I saw the movie, too,
and it was twenty-four!

1405
01:34:00,272 --> 01:34:01,267
Freeze!

1406
01:34:02,064 --> 01:34:04,273
- I'm not moving an inch.
- Robert Caulfield?

1407
01:34:04,309 --> 01:34:06,353
- Yeah, who the hell are you?
- Federal Agents.

1408
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,362
We have a warrant to search
your apartment.

1409
01:34:08,398 --> 01:34:11,562
- You have a warrant? What for?
- Just don't move.

1410
01:34:11,857 --> 01:34:14,107
I promise. Just tell me
what this is all about.

1411
01:34:14,143 --> 01:34:15,516
<i>Hey, come here! Look at this!</i>

1412
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:17,764
Could you come with me,
please, Mr. Caulfield?

1413
01:34:47,318 --> 01:34:49,143
Mr. Caulfield, I'm sorry.

1414
01:34:49,651 --> 01:34:52,401
However, you're under arrest
for possession of cocaine.

1415
01:34:52,735 --> 01:34:53,932
I don't believe it.

1416
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:57,479
I don't believe it. You guys put it there,
you know you did.

1417
01:34:57,985 --> 01:34:59,692
You have the right to remain silent.

1418
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:05,986
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I don't believe it. You put it there.

1419
01:35:06,022 --> 01:35:08,688
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law.

1420
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:12,104
You're part of all this. You mothers.

1421
01:35:13,362 --> 01:35:14,559
Ow, that hurts!

1422
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:16,492
You don't have to put
handcuffs on me!

1423
01:35:16,528 --> 01:35:19,326
Please, Mr. Caulfield, these are
serious charges against you.

1424
01:35:19,362 --> 01:35:22,526
- Don't add to them by resisting arrest.
- I don't bel...! That hurts!

1425
01:35:23,362 --> 01:35:24,855
I don't believe this.

1426
01:35:33,822 --> 01:35:36,689
Well, hello there, Caulfield!
So nice to see you!

1427
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,646
It's at this point that Alan Hale says
to Richard Conte...

1428
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:43,551
- Jimmy Stewart.
- Yeah, Jimmy Stewart, thank you.

1429
01:35:43,588 --> 01:35:45,864
Look, Scoop, I can't keep bailing you
out of trouble.

1430
01:35:45,901 --> 01:35:47,244
The front office is on my neck.

1431
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:50,489
I don't know how much longer
I can keep them off, right?

1432
01:35:50,526 --> 01:35:51,453
- Right.
- Wrong!

1433
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:54,198
I got you out of there so as not to
embarrass the Network.

1434
01:35:54,235 --> 01:35:56,907
I mean, you are a schmuck!
I can't trust you to cover a fire!

1435
01:35:56,943 --> 01:35:58,904
You'll probably fall down
and get burned!

1436
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,865
You probably would be the cause of it!

1437
01:36:00,902 --> 01:36:02,986
A company car? You are fired!

1438
01:36:03,115 --> 01:36:06,324
I love that so much!
I'm gonna say it again!

1439
01:36:06,361 --> 01:36:09,533
You're fired! You're through!
Oh, I love it!

1440
01:36:09,569 --> 01:36:11,413
It's not what it looks like, really.

1441
01:36:11,449 --> 01:36:13,736
'Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!'

1442
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:19,700
I told you. You tell me about the lonely
plight of a dedicated journalist.

1443
01:36:19,737 --> 01:36:20,789
I tell you to stuff it.

1444
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:22,742
You tell me about a meaningful
relationship.

1445
01:36:22,778 --> 01:36:23,997
I tell you to stuff it.

1446
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:26,242
You tell me you're in trouble,
you're out on bail,

1447
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:28,451
you just got fired,
I tell you I'll be right over.

1448
01:36:28,487 --> 01:36:30,206
- My head hurts.
- You look awful.

1449
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:32,243
- Thank you, very much.
- You're quite welcome.

1450
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:33,617
Did you find out what I asked?

1451
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:37,160
One o'clock in the morning
I get a call from an unemployed junkie

1452
01:36:37,196 --> 01:36:40,410
to find out all the military installations
in a 300 miles radius

1453
01:36:40,447 --> 01:36:41,415
around Houston, Texas.

1454
01:36:41,452 --> 01:36:44,139
You certainly have a way with words.
Did you find out?

1455
01:36:44,175 --> 01:36:46,825
Yes, and it wasn't easy.
It took exhaustive research.

1456
01:36:47,036 --> 01:36:48,708
Well, I'm proud of you.
How many?

1457
01:36:48,744 --> 01:36:52,411
One. White Bluff. It's a S AC base.
My father used to be stationed there.

1458
01:36:52,448 --> 01:36:54,117
That's exhaustive research?

1459
01:36:54,203 --> 01:36:57,370
At one o'clock in the morning,
you call your father, that's exhaustive.

1460
01:36:57,406 --> 01:36:59,620
- White Bluff... That's too big.
- Too big for what?

1461
01:36:59,656 --> 01:37:01,828
- Too big for what I want.
- What do you want?

1462
01:37:01,865 --> 01:37:03,292
I'm thinking of enlisting.

1463
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:06,120
- They'll never take you.
- That's why I'm thinking of enlisting.

1464
01:37:06,157 --> 01:37:08,501
- You're on a story, aren't you?
- I was fired!

1465
01:37:08,537 --> 01:37:11,329
You're on a story and I'm helping you.
This can't be happening.

1466
01:37:11,366 --> 01:37:12,585
I really appreciate that.

1467
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:15,246
The only reason I'm doing it,
considering your track record,

1468
01:37:15,283 --> 01:37:18,038
whatever story you're on
will turn out to be garbage.

1469
01:37:18,075 --> 01:37:19,697
You shouldn't mince words.

1470
01:37:26,789 --> 01:37:28,993
I'll fix you some coffee.
Then you can jump me.

1471
01:37:29,331 --> 01:37:31,368
There's no other one besides
White Bluff?

1472
01:37:31,622 --> 01:37:32,535
No.

1473
01:37:32,998 --> 01:37:35,711
Except one abandoned base
they used for training

1474
01:37:35,748 --> 01:37:38,962
during World War II, Jackson.
There's nothing there now.

1475
01:37:38,998 --> 01:37:41,913
- Don't you want to jump me?
- Of course I do. Where's Jackson?

1476
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:47,238
About 300 miles directly West.
I think I'm gonna get angry with you.

1477
01:37:47,915 --> 01:37:50,618
- Do you have any money on you?
- Do you want me to pay you?

1478
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:52,046
How much?

1479
01:37:52,082 --> 01:37:55,041
About 100. Why don't I just leave it
on the dresser in the morning?

1480
01:37:55,077 --> 01:37:56,036
Give it to me now.

1481
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:58,541
In advance?
That's the height of conceit!

1482
01:37:58,578 --> 01:38:00,579
Please, and your car keys.

1483
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:06,123
You're really being terrific, why?

1484
01:38:07,584 --> 01:38:09,869
You're not as obnoxious
when you are helpless.

1485
01:38:09,906 --> 01:38:12,156
- Thank you very much.
- You're quite welcome.

1486
01:38:14,043 --> 01:38:16,423
Also, Liz Haller said you were super.

1487
01:38:16,459 --> 01:38:19,493
Well, when I get back,
we'll jump each other.

1488
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:20,658
Maybe.

1489
01:38:22,752 --> 01:38:23,948
I'll get arrested again.

1490
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:26,205
It's a deal.

1491
01:45:08,784 --> 01:45:09,814
Mornin'.

1492
01:45:12,409 --> 01:45:14,447
- Mornin'.
- You in charge here?

1493
01:45:16,034 --> 01:45:17,659
- You see that sign there?
- Yes.

1494
01:45:17,696 --> 01:45:18,665
Well, read it.

1495
01:45:18,701 --> 01:45:19,815
- I did.
- Out loud!

1496
01:45:20,368 --> 01:45:22,655
'A and A Crop Dusting Service'.

1497
01:45:22,993 --> 01:45:24,616
You wanna know who I am?

1498
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:26,749
I'll bet you're one of the 'A's.

1499
01:45:26,785 --> 01:45:29,785
Well, which one? I'll bet you can't
answer that question, smart-ass!

1500
01:45:29,822 --> 01:45:31,029
- The first one.
- Wrong!

1501
01:45:31,452 --> 01:45:34,023
- Can I have one more guess?
- You got it.

1502
01:45:34,327 --> 01:45:35,571
The second one.

1503
01:45:36,202 --> 01:45:40,279
Wrong. I'm both of 'em!
'A' and 'A'. My name is Albain.

1504
01:45:40,536 --> 01:45:45,036
I got a son. The other 'A' was for him,
but he don't like to fly and is a lawyer.

1505
01:45:45,073 --> 01:45:46,959
He's a pervert, so I took the 'A'
away.

1506
01:45:46,995 --> 01:45:49,697
Wanna speak to somebody in charge?
You're speakin' to both o' them.

1507
01:45:49,954 --> 01:45:52,725
- My name is Caulfield.
- Hey, I can't help that.

1508
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:55,496
Mr. Albain, how much do you charge
to dust a field?

1509
01:45:55,532 --> 01:45:57,984
- 25 dollars.
- I'd like to hire your plane.

1510
01:45:58,329 --> 01:46:01,280
- That'll be 100 dollars.
- You said you charged 25.

1511
01:46:01,663 --> 01:46:05,455
25 dollars t' dust a field, but you ain't
got no field because you ain't a farmer,

1512
01:46:05,491 --> 01:46:08,122
which means you ain't poor
and I think you're a pervert!

1513
01:46:09,288 --> 01:46:10,669
Okay, 100.

1514
01:46:10,705 --> 01:46:12,627
- 125.
- What?

1515
01:46:12,664 --> 01:46:15,081
Because you said 'yes' to 100
too quick,

1516
01:46:15,117 --> 01:46:16,988
which means you can afford 125!

1517
01:46:24,248 --> 01:46:25,670
Where do you wanna go,
smart-ass?

1518
01:46:25,706 --> 01:46:27,873
I'm not sure. I'm looking for someone
who's lost.

1519
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:28,987
It's your money.

1520
01:48:02,089 --> 01:48:05,214
Put your Goddamn head down
so I can see!

1521
01:48:05,251 --> 01:48:07,086
Why didn't you sit in front?

1522
01:48:07,756 --> 01:48:09,664
- You know how to fly?
- No!

1523
01:48:10,215 --> 01:48:12,262
Then I gotta sit in back

1524
01:48:12,298 --> 01:48:15,830
and you gotta put your Goddamn
head down, smart-ass!

1525
01:48:55,302 --> 01:48:57,677
Now, what the hell is your friend doin'
out here?

1526
01:48:57,713 --> 01:48:58,790
He's lost!

1527
01:48:59,844 --> 01:49:02,130
- He rob a bank or somethin'?
- No!

1528
01:49:03,219 --> 01:49:05,340
- Well, I get a third!
- What?

1529
01:49:05,636 --> 01:49:08,094
We find him, I get a third of the loot!

1530
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:10,168
Now, keep your Goddamn head down!

1531
01:50:01,432 --> 01:50:03,807
You think we should go
in another direction?

1532
01:50:03,843 --> 01:50:05,146
- Hey!
- What?

1533
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:06,924
- Over there!
- Where?

1534
01:50:07,266 --> 01:50:08,593
Helicopters!

1535
01:50:08,682 --> 01:50:10,839
I seen them fly around here
last couple of days!

1536
01:50:11,016 --> 01:50:13,302
- Let's follow 'em!
- I would if I could see 'em!

1537
01:51:18,188 --> 01:51:20,013
They're goin' down over there!

1538
01:51:49,107 --> 01:51:50,730
He must be in there!

1539
01:51:51,315 --> 01:51:52,477
Let's go down.

1540
01:51:53,649 --> 01:51:55,391
They got guns, Sonny!

1541
01:51:56,107 --> 01:51:58,431
You said you wanted a third of the loot!

1542
01:51:59,274 --> 01:52:01,680
- Half!
- Okay, half!

1543
01:55:03,456 --> 01:55:05,493
Keep your Goddamn head down!

1544
01:57:10,507 --> 01:57:13,754
Pull that lever down by your feet
when I tell you, Sonny!

1545
01:57:23,717 --> 01:57:24,830
Now!

1546
01:57:57,136 --> 01:57:58,333
Perverts!

1547
01:57:59,261 --> 01:58:00,837
Remember, I get half!

1548
01:58:08,887 --> 01:58:10,261
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1549
01:58:10,345 --> 01:58:11,589
<i>Mrs. Brubaker</i>

1550
01:58:11,929 --> 01:58:14,252
<i>Mrs. Willis, Mrs. Walker,</i>

1551
01:58:15,012 --> 01:58:16,505
<i>my fellow Americans.</i>

1552
01:58:17,304 --> 01:58:20,717
<i>I come here today to talk of</i>
<i>unfinished hopes</i>

1553
01:58:21,346 --> 01:58:23,337
<i>and of unfulfilled dreams.</i>

1554
01:58:23,888 --> 01:58:27,550
<i>Charles Brubaker, Peter Willis</i>
<i>and John Walker</i>

1555
01:58:28,055 --> 01:58:32,215
<i>left this Earth for their dream</i>
<i>a little more than eight months ago.</i>

1556
01:58:32,472 --> 01:58:34,759
<i>They were never able</i>
<i>to return to us.</i>

1557
01:58:35,722 --> 01:58:38,804
Their dream was able to grow
and flourish

1558
01:58:39,306 --> 01:58:42,640
because of the support of millions
of citizens

1559
01:58:42,676 --> 01:58:43,753
all across America

1560
01:58:44,598 --> 01:58:48,046
at a time when cynicism was
a national epidemic,

1561
01:58:49,098 --> 01:58:52,097
they gave us something
to take pride in.

1562
01:58:53,224 --> 01:58:56,803
It is a dream that
should not be allowed to die.

1563
01:58:58,474 --> 01:59:01,887
A nation is built on the spirit
of its people.

1564
01:59:03,058 --> 01:59:05,214
The test of the greatness
of any nation

1565
01:59:05,558 --> 01:59:08,509
is how that nation pulls together
in a time of crisis.

1566
01:59:09,683 --> 01:59:12,306
The only limits on what
we can achieve

1567
01:59:12,342 --> 01:59:14,928
are the limits we place on our hopes.

1568
01:59:15,601 --> 01:59:20,886
These three men reminded us
of the limitlessness of our hopes.

1569
01:59:21,893 --> 01:59:25,010
There was a moment
in these past few days

1570
01:59:25,476 --> 01:59:28,309
when we were all one people.

1571
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,889
We were all hoping,

1572
01:59:31,435 --> 01:59:33,473
we were all a little bit taller,

1573
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:35,601
a little bit prouder.

1574
01:59:36,019 --> 01:59:39,847
We were all feeling the same fears
and the same exhilaration.

1575
01:59:40,311 --> 01:59:42,816
These three men brought us together.

1576
01:59:42,853 --> 01:59:47,060
We knew together that
there are no goals we cannot reach

1577
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:50,187
if just reach for them together.

1578
01:59:51,353 --> 01:59:53,640
There is no adequate way

1579
01:59:54,062 --> 01:59:57,724
in which we can express our gratitude
to the men themselves

1580
01:59:58,562 --> 02:00:01,265
because they are no longer among us.

1581
02:00:02,104 --> 02:00:05,268
However,
we can serve their memory,

1582
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:06,972
what they stood for...
