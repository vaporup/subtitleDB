1
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,012
Frost fills the sky over Ten Mile Lake

2
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,990
Silken threads anxious of youth

3
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,426
Looking at the moon and feeling lonely

4
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,896
Envious of love, not of immortality

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,000
This pointing

6
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,400
will remind you of me

7
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:16,435
Hsiao-tsing's grave?!

8
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,868
Hsiao-tsing died long ago

9
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,537
She's ghost?!

10
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:29,148
Yes! I'm a ghost but I bring
mortals no harm

11
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,755
I died far away from my home

12
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,722
An evil spirit took by corpse
and won't let me rest in peace

13
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:37,260
If you want to save me

14
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,954
move my bones away from here

15
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,032
Then it will be possible
for me to be reincarnated

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,701
Hsiao-tsing!

17
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,031
I will save you

18
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,509
Hsiao-tsing!

19
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,670
Ning!

20
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,948
You dare oppose me?! I will
never excuse you from death!

21
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,852
Let them go, please

22
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:12,688
The Diamond Sutra!

23
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,664
We've escaped!
Hsiao-tsing, we're safe!

24
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,103
Dawn is breaking

25
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,200
Hsiao-tsing, hide in the tower of ashes

26
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,504
If the sun's rays shine on you

27
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,806
you'll never be reincarnated

28
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,281
Ning, good-bye forever!

29
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,033
I hope that Hsiao-tsing will be reincarnated

30
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,366
I must return to the
Orchid Temple

31
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,032
If you need me, you can find me there
Take care!

32
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,684
Who is that young man!

33
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,330
He's the poor scholar
who lived two blocks away

34
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,592
Things have changed since he was last here

35
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,378
Wasn't he that shop's bill collector?

36
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:52,251
He doesn't even know it
went out of business long ago!

37
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,171
Welcome! Welcome!

38
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,963
The bill collector's here

39
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,068
How much money did you collect?

40
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,535
We're here to catch escaped convicts

41
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,337
It's the police! Run!

42
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,910
Pursue them!

43
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,244
You're Bing Chow?!

44
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:51,940
You made a mistake

45
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,382
He has a beard and I don't!

46
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,816
You shaved it off!

47
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,182
Take him back and collect the reward

48
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,619
Get in!

49
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,519
I haven't committed any crime!

50
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,889
Let me go
I've been wrongly accused!

51
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,395
Let me go
I've been wrongly accused!

52
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,967
You made a mistake
I'm not Bing Chow!

53
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,295
I am wrongly accused!

54
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,445
My name is Ning, not Bing Chow

55
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,451
Old man may I ask who...

56
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:36,455
A man, just like you, fated to
being imprisoned

57
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,994
So pessimistic!

58
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,463
It's all me elders' fault, insisting
I get an education

59
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,125
When I grew up, I was learned
and wrote backs

60
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,695
But when I write of my travels

61
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,840
I'm accused of
revealing state secrets

62
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,475
When I write of history, they say
I'm satirizing the present

63
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,737
If I analyze military strategy, they
say I'm planning a rebellion

64
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,312
I can't even write fairy tales

65
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,312
Finally, I wrote the
biography of a powerful man

66
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,250
Then he was arrested, accused
of being a rebel

67
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,323
We were both sentenced
to life imprisonment

68
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,052
Wouldn't you say
that prison is my fate?

69
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,058
A cockroach!

70
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,892
Where?

71
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,294
Cockroach?!

72
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,396
You're really wasteful! The cockroaches
here are of the best quality

73
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,099
There are no delicacies here

74
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,039
After you're been here a while

75
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,179
you'll even salivate ever a housefly

76
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,814
Old man, how long have your been here?

77
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,208
I was your age when I first arrived

78
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,912
Look how I've changed!
Full of character!

79
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,646
You've been here a long time!

80
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,622
Help! I am innocent!

81
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,160
I'm not Bing Chow!
I am innocent!

82
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,124
You've made a mistake
I'm not Bing Chow!

83
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:22,162
Another nightmare
What did you dream this time?

84
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,529
I dreamt you were
haggard and exhausted

85
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,635
Exhausted?!

86
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,897
True, you will soon be totally exhausted

87
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,370
You have nightmares every night
Look at the calendar

88
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,773
You've been here so long
and still can't adjust

89
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,106
Soon you'll even forget that
your last name is Chow

90
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,348
Old man, my last name isn't Chow!

91
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,817
Bing Chow!

92
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,545
Supper!

93
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,781
OK

94
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,195
A chicken leg?!

95
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,197
Happy days are here again!

96
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,563
Old man! There's only one bowl
You eat first

97
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,434
No, it's for you
I'd rather eat cockroaches

98
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,565
I'll tell you something
when you've finished

99
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,677
I haven't had chicken
in a long time

100
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,743
Old man, why are you
carving my name?

101
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,145
All these men

102
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,750
ate chicken legs

103
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,547
We call that chicken
a headless chicken

104
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,823
After you've eaten it, they
chop off your head!

105
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,424
Chop off your head?!

106
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:31,300
Bing Chow, we have
no personal quarrel

107
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,563
Don't come back from the grave
and seek revenge on me!

108
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,101
They behead people at noon

109
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,404
It's now the middle of the night

110
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,780
Some official's son got in trouble

111
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,746
and they're looking for a substitute

112
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,145
At night

113
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,254
the executioner can't tell one from another

114
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,321
Is there no justice in the world?

115
00:09:54,994 --> 00:10:00,694
Is there no reward for being a good man?

116
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:13,879
It is of no concern to me

117
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,516
I was always an honest man

118
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,586
I'll give you whatever I can

119
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,449
This painting was a gift
from my dearest one

120
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,355
I don't want to part
with it even in death

121
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,092
Young man, you have a good heart

122
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,891
Let me give you a present

123
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,798
You are so learned

124
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,528
It is fortunate that
I die rather than you

125
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,570
You're a good man
Such a pity you have to die

126
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,231
It would be a pity if you died, not me

127
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,933
Anybody's death is a pity

128
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,408
You're a rare specimen

129
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,945
If you die, your type will be extinct

130
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,605
It's been a long time
since I set somebody free

131
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,251
This tunnel leads to the outside

132
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,887
Go out and start anew

133
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,848
Don't give me such false hopes

134
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,324
If this is an escape route, why
didn't you escape long ago?

135
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,725
It's less troublesome for me
to write my book here

136
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,388
When I finish, then I'll escape
and get it printed

137
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,397
Don't worry about me

138
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,565
Always keep this bundle with you

139
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,968
Once you're out of here
never come back!

140
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,803
Get going!

141
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,936
What will happen to you
after I've gone?

142
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,745
They like hearing my stories

143
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,609
So long as I don't get
to the story's end

144
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,807
They'll never harm me

145
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,042
But they'll accuse you
of helping me escape

146
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,186
I'll say you were put to death

147
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,878
for somebody else two days ago

148
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,492
They won't dare make a fuse

149
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,456
Go!
Take care!

150
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,996
Bing Chow! The time has come!

151
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,259
Hurry up!

152
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:44,800
Bing Chow!

153
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,437
He's dead

154
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,913
I've escaped!

155
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,927
There's even a horse
here waiting for me!

156
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,460
That old man

157
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,503
is really remarkable!

158
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,665
I must reply his kindness someday

159
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,807
Hey! That's my horse!

160
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,146
What a stupid horse! Letting
a stranger ride him!

161
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,381
I don't even have time
to wash my hands!

162
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,519
You think you're fast over land
I'll go underground!

163
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,120
Open sesame!

164
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,429
I must find a place to
get out of this downpour!

165
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,341
Good! A House!

166
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,044
Open the door!

167
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,222
"Righteous Villa"

168
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,696
Anybody home?

169
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:35,839
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

170
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,381
Eight Coffins!
Must be the whole family

171
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,411
I won't disturb you
I just want to stay the night

172
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,125
Don't bother to get up
I'll take care of myself

173
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:55,190
I told you not to go to
any trouble. Please go back!

174
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,665
The way you rush about

175
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,765
in no fixed direction!

176
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,840
I had a hard time
following you underground

177
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,408
Don't you have any idea
where you're going?

178
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,569
Your face looks so horrible, you must
have suffered a painful death

179
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,611
If you'd rushed around
underground all day like me

180
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,979
you wouldn't have the energy
to come back to the surface

181
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,691
I don't know you
Why are you following me?

182
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,328
I don't know you either
so why did you take my horse?

183
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,220
That's your horse?

184
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,366
I thought it was the old man's

185
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,502
Still you should have asked

186
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,296
before taking it

187
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,165
You're alive! Sorry!
It's all a misunderstanding

188
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,405
If there's anything I can do
to help, just let me know

189
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,877
Enough of your tricks! A good thing
my reactions are so fast

190
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,446
Friend, you need a place
to stay the night

191
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,316
Here there's a roof over your head
Might as well stay here

192
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:51,854
How do I know

193
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,685
what you'd do after I fell asleep?

194
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,825
I knew it!

195
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,766
Let's draw up some boundaries
I'm staying next door

196
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,929
If you have something to say, shout it!
Don't come over

197
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,947
I haven't bathed in a long time

198
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,641
Who is it?

199
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,984
Are you a mortal?

200
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,551
Hey, friend next door!

201
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,852
Get up! There's ghosts!

202
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,052
Get up! Do you hear me?

203
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,924
Hurry and get up!

204
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,656
Not a sound
Maybe he left already

205
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,180
What a nuisance!

206
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,865
Friend, there are fierce ghosts here!

207
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,032
Ghosts?
I'll use my magic to banish them!

208
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,942
Ghosts and goblins
I order you to leave!

209
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,717
Oh, you understand the occult!

210
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,562
My nose is sensitive
to other worldly spirits...

211
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,390
So why do I smell nothing now?

212
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,195
Get out of the way!

213
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,660
Abracadabra!

214
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,739
Strange!
Not even a hint of ghostly odor!

215
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,902
Abracadabra! Hocus-pocus flash!

216
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,927
They're coming
Leave!

217
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,671
You're not even real ghosts!

218
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,907
Wasting my occult talents!

219
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,345
Phonies?

220
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,465
Want to trick me?

221
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,232
A good thing you have a waistband

222
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,349
Stay away from me!

223
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,253
I'm falling...

224
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,397
Stop hugging me!

225
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,596
Let go!

226
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,995
If I let go, I'll fall!

227
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,161
If you don't let go, I'll...

228
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,195
Hsiao-tsing?!

229
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:13,930
Hsiao-tsing?!

230
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:24,571
Hocus-pocus heebie-jeebie!
I order you to freeze!

231
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,617
Freeze!

232
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,310
Freeze!

233
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,853
Freeze!

234
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,581
Hsiao-tsing, is that you?

235
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,292
What kind of black magic is that?
Let them go!

236
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,450
Otherwise I'll kill him

237
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,153
Oh... Freeze!

238
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,734
Kill him! He's no friend of mine!

239
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,401
Elder Chu Kot!

240
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,070
Chu Kot?! Are you Elder Chu Kot
traveling incognito?

241
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,575
Elder who?

242
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,736
Your disciple is deeply sorry

243
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,848
Disciple?!

244
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,275
Elder Chu Kot?!

245
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,686
Hsiao-tsing, it's me!
Don't you recognize me?

246
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,189
We come from a good family
My name is Windy

247
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,793
This is my younger sister, Moon

248
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,861
Elder Chu Kot

249
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,725
Elder, you can save us

250
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,867
My father is Lord Fu
the ex-Minister of Rites

251
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,559
He was framed. They're now
transporting him to be executed

252
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,103
We want to attack the transport
wagon and rescue him

253
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,042
You are the learned
and brilliant Chu Kot

254
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,678
You two are loyal imperial warriors

255
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,006
Everyone is an eminent personage

256
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,671
Now it's my turn to introduce myself

257
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,546
I am...
Spell!

258
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,121
My name is Autumn

259
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,886
from the Kunlun sect

260
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,029
I've read everything that
the Elder has written

261
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,926
I only use my magic
to battle demons

262
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,726
I never get involved
in affairs of state

263
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,026
We pay our respects to Elder Chu Kot

264
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,834
My name is Ning, not Chu Kot

265
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,106
I can tell you are clever

266
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,039
Clever people do not always
reveal their identities

267
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,578
Anyway, in our hearts
we know who you really are

268
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,516
How can I make you believe me?

269
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,843
No need for you to say anything
Everybody remember...

270
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:08,883
From now on

271
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,248
Elder Chu Kot will be known as Ning

272
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,912
Chu Kot is Ning

273
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,250
Yes!

274
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,650
We will now take an oath

275
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,796
Whoever reveal their identities

276
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,329
will be chopped up
into 10,000 pieces

277
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,228
Yes!

278
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,466
Such an honour that
you rode my horse!

279
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,942
Hsiao-tsing, do you remember
this painting and poem?

280
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,810
Hsiao-tsing? Poem?

281
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,954
He's reciting poetry
Quickly, pen and paper

282
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,850
We must record what he says
Elder is giving us a hint

283
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,923
Hurry!

284
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,756
Frost fills the sky
over Ten Mile Lake;

285
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,262
Silken threads anxious of youth

286
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,129
Looking at the moon
and feeling lonely

287
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,396
Envious of lovers,
not of immortality

288
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,263
Very profound!

289
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,803
What does "ten mile" mean?

290
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,080
Ten mile!

291
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,875
It is all very deep

292
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,750
His words are too profound

293
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,925
Ten Mile?
That must mean Ten Mile Pavilion

294
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:23,685
What do you mean?

295
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,557
There's a Ten Mile Pavilion near hear

296
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:31,098
That's right! Sister, "ten mile'
refers to Ten Mile Pavilion

297
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,702
It's nearby

298
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,004
I understand
Ten Mile Pavilion is not far from here

299
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,975
"Frost" refers to Frost's Descent

300
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,739
Each year has 24 climatic periods...

301
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,746
After the autumnal equinox
comes the frost...

302
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,475
and today is the day
of Frost's Descent

303
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,619
Elder is telling us that

304
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,311
father will be transported
past Ten Mile Pavilion

305
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,751
He's telling us to rescue him there

306
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:56,383
Elder is truly perceptive
We can save father

307
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,959
We had it right!

308
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,324
Good

309
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,195
It hurts!

310
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,229
What's the matter? Get up!

311
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,701
Reporting!

312
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,966
Miss Windy!

313
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,405
Your father will pass the
Ten Mile Pavilion tonight

314
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,874
We already know that

315
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,814
Elder is truly brilliant!

316
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,474
But what about the rest of the poem?

317
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,312
What do those two stanzas mean?

318
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,510
Three stanzas

319
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,847
The meaning doesn't matter now

320
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,717
Interpret it in any way you desire

321
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,018
He means that we should
have our own views...

322
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,888
notjust listen to what
other people say, right?

323
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,688
So, should we still
listen to what Elder says?

324
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,591
Not only listen

325
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,391
but take notes and
ponder his meaning

326
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,329
We must pass his wisdom
on to future generations

327
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,331
Right!

328
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,595
Time to leave!

329
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,170
Good-bye

330
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,472
We're off to Ten Mile Pavilion

331
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,074
Yes. We're off to Ten Mile Pavilion

332
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,843
Miss Windy, please return
Hsiao-tsing's painting to me

333
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,539
Yes, Elder

334
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,585
When you call me Hsiao-tsing, is that a
hint that I need a pseudonym?

335
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,054
From now on, my name is Hsiao-tsing

336
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,159
If Hsiao-tsing were reincarnated

337
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,629
she would now be a babe in arms

338
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,367
She's not Hsiao-tsing!

339
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,557
What are you spying on?

340
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:47,437
Me?...
Nothing

341
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,309
What are you spying on?

342
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,115
I wanted to see what you were spying on
Time to go!

343
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,219
Do you think your fiance, Prince Ma...

344
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,881
is as handsome as Elder?

345
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,424
We were betrothed before birth

346
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,993
How do I know what he looks like?

347
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,892
Is that what people mean by fate?

348
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,732
Who are you referring to?

349
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,064
Oh, nobody
It's just that I fell so fortunate

350
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,508
Fortunate?
You're frothing at the mouth!

351
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,600
Evil spirits!

352
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,737
Is this a foot print or a hand print?

353
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,712
We'll know when we find the monster

354
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,181
Right!

355
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,413
It even harmed a man

356
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,116
What a pity to leave it here
Better show it to Elder

357
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,955
OK!

358
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,892
There really are ghosts in this place!

359
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:21,531
What is that?

360
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,964
A corpse!
It's all that ghost's fault

361
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,659
Don't hug it. Put it down

362
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,233
How did this person
die so pitifully?

363
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,431
I'd say this an evil ghost

364
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,769
The odor is very strong

365
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,904
It's back!

366
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,445
Is it looking for us?

367
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,138
Use your "freeze" magic

368
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,278
Right!

369
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,648
I command you to freeze!

370
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:50,285
Heebie-jeebie! Freeze!
That'll stop him!

371
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,063
How do you do it?

372
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,426
When you see a ghost

373
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,431
shout "freeze"

374
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:05,404
Like this? Freeze! Is that right?
Hey!

375
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,842
Oh, no!
How do you lift the spell?

376
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,982
I have to think of a way
to communicate with him

377
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,780
What can I do?
Let's try this...

378
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,887
If I'm right

379
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,354
move your eyes up and down

380
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,924
That's right! Fantastic!

381
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,789
If I'm wrong, move them
from left to right

382
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,760
Great!

383
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,928
Will a hand gesture lift the spell?

384
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,317
What?
Not up and down or left to right

385
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,577
Don'tjoke with me

386
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,846
If we wait too long, that
monster will get us

387
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,683
Does lifting the spell

388
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,018
have to do with an
acupuncture point?

389
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,690
Your eyes are moving faster
than a revolving lantern!

390
00:29:58,863 --> 00:29:59,955
I understand!

391
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,258
You're provoking me into hitting you

392
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:06,460
OK. I'm going to hit you now

393
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,663
Ready or not, here it comes!

394
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,951
Let's get out of here!

395
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,054
Come on!

396
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,684
You're too heavy

397
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,495
I can't carry you

398
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,260
Drag it!

399
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,540
Dragging you isn't fast enough either

400
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,677
Better hide upstairs

401
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,481
I told you not to fool around
at a time like this

402
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,818
That monster is so tall, it'll see
us if he stands up straight

403
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,235
How can I undo the spell?

404
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,606
How do I lift the spell?

405
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,733
It's safer inside
Better hide yourself quick

406
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,452
I told you to hide inside

407
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,390
Why did you go down there, where
it's so dangerous?

408
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:22,101
Try the "freeze" curse! Freeze!

409
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,817
Let's continue with out guessing game

410
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,082
You're getting heavier and heavier
Can't carry you much longer

411
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,385
Since that monster isn't here...

412
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,323
Let's try to lift the spell

413
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,696
Does it have anything
to do with this amulet?

414
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,892
Yes?! What then?

415
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,403
Point at me. Point at me and
the curse will be lifted

416
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,406
Point!

417
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:04,714
How do I undo the spell?

418
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,047
No good asking you!
I must figure it out for myself

419
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,902
Freeze!

420
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:38,478
Don't move!... Move! Move!

421
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,276
Don't move!

422
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,712
Why does he

423
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:44,877
"unfreeze" so quickly

424
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,217
but you haven't moved for so long?

425
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:53,424
Do you mean
I pointed to this amulet...

426
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,098
Then I asked you how
to lift the spell...

427
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,562
And he moved! Freeze!

428
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,835
I'll take care of it
Get out of here fast!

429
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,505
Finally lifted the spell!

430
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,271
Get out of here!

431
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,102
Abracadabra! Open up a way out!

432
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,715
Abracadabra! Open up a way out!

433
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,415
Out of the way!
I'll take care of it!

434
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,800
Abracadabra!

435
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,407
Hocus pocus!

436
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,170
Abracadabra!

437
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,680
Hocus pocus!

438
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:11,192
I order all ghosts to be expelled!

439
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,145
Wow!
It doesn't fear my incantations!

440
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,181
Take this!

441
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,087
It's still moving!

442
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:49,539
I order all ghosts to be expelled!
Hocus pocus!

443
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,707
Even when it's chopped up
he can still run away!

444
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,408
It could still
come back at any time

445
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,554
Elder, get out of here
I'll pursue it!

446
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,881
Be careful!

447
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,216
Earth, open up!

448
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,195
Dawn is breaking

449
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,265
Heebie-jeebie! Freeze!

450
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,410
Freeze!

451
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,078
Earth, open up!

452
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,252
Want to leave!

453
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,219
Wow!

454
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,862
My magical powers are
no good at all

455
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,465
Earth, open up!

456
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,835
A magician?!

457
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,640
Take this!

458
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,455
Hey! Stop! Stop!

459
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,224
Are you stupid?
I told you to stop!

460
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,519
We don't even know each other
Why are we fighting?

461
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,098
I learned magic to deal
with evil spirits

462
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,030
If you don't stop, I'll use my
magic to "freeze" you

463
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,561
Why are you blocking my way?

464
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:29,997
I was just taking a rest
after battling some ghosts

465
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,732
and you say I'm blocking your way

466
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,843
When that monster makes a run for it
tonight, you'll be in deep trouble

467
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:34,670
Brother!

468
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,176
Call me Master

469
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,245
Master, your skill is extraordinary

470
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,746
If you worked for the imperial court

471
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,316
your future would be boundless

472
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,953
You know that I'm a Taoist monk

473
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,089
Seeking wealth and position is

474
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,724
for the likes of you mere mortals

475
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:52,261
I don't want to end up like you...
Earth, open up!

476
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,326
Well done, young man!

477
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,524
Hu, our hourses' hoofs-are rigid

478
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,535
They won't move!

479
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,474
It must be that monk's magic at work!

480
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,806
He said there are evil spirits
Be careful!

481
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,208
Yes!

482
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,494
Lord Fu!

483
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,424
There's nothing I can do about

484
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,759
squabbles in the imperial court

485
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:33,028
It's hard to tell right from wrong

486
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,904
I'm just following orders

487
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,165
But don't worry

488
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,466
I'll make sure yourjourney is safe

489
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:41,971
After we get to the capital

490
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:46,276
whatever the emperor does to
you is not me responsibility

491
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,515
Let's go!

492
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,734
Where can I get something to eat?

493
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,036
Please give me a bowl
of your cheapest food

494
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,472
What? The cheapest?

495
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,078
Sit down!

496
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,941
If you're starving
don't waste your money

497
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,780
Show me your face

498
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,215
Go!

499
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,151
Stand up

500
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,555
Don't lower your head

501
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:30,591
Go!

502
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,251
Go!

503
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,421
Don't run away!

504
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,793
Don't move!

505
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,569
Monks?

506
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,474
Don't move!

507
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,769
Stand still!

508
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,721
Out of the way!

509
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,757
Get out of the way!

510
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,913
What kind of magic is this?

511
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:54,133
It's Windy...
Wait!

512
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,539
Come back!

513
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,579
Hey!

514
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,409
The soldiers never come to
Ten Mile Pavilion last night

515
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,414
Rush back to Righteous Villa
and lie in ambush for them

516
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,686
Hey!

517
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,291
Back to Righteous Villa?
It's haunted!

518
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,594
Come back!

519
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,098
Elder! Elder!

520
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,330
I wonder if Elder has already gone?

521
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,167
Better search for him

522
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,003
Yes!

523
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:32,346
Do you think father's transport
has already passed by here?

524
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,883
No. They're not supposed to
reach here until after dark

525
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,147
Miss Windy, the villa
has been ransacked

526
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,415
I'm sure Elder did it to
remove any traces of our presence

527
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,752
Set everything up
Prepare to attack

528
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,518
Yes!

529
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,355
Hurry up! Over there!

530
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,401
Who is it?

531
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,172
Who is it?

532
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,213
I'm Ning
Ning?

533
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,979
Oh, it's Elder!

534
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,417
This villa is haunted

535
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,557
Haunted?

536
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,657
Where is Miss Windy?

537
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,123
Inside

538
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:51,955
Ghosts?

539
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,289
Real ghosts?

540
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,710
Miss Windy!

541
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,716
My clothes!

542
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,759
Miss Windy!

543
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:26,726
Miss Windy!

544
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,927
Elder, they said you came

545
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,569
Miss Moon!

546
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,537
Who are you?

547
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,542
Oh, it's Elder
I recognize your back

548
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,811
Elder...

549
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,555
With your beard shaved off
you're so, so...

550
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,494
Yes

551
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,326
When my sister sees you

552
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,833
she'll be so happy for me

553
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,136
Happy?!

554
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,364
When you came in, did you
see my sister?

555
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,768
Your sister? No, No!

556
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:17,710
Sister! Sister!
Sister!

557
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,783
What are you grinning about?

558
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,476
It is improper to look

559
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,117
Ms. Moon

560
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,920
There are some things
you shouldn't look at

561
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,084
You're all right!

562
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,856
I didn't recognize Elder
with his beard shaved off

563
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,262
Really? I must see for myself

564
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,061
Elder, if you have something to
say, just say it

565
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,329
It scares me when
you hint at things

566
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,029
I'm cold

567
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,801
Your face is so hot
how can you be cold?

568
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,436
Wouldn't this be faster?

569
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,102
Not fast enough
Faster would be better

570
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,272
Faster?!... OK

571
00:45:59,289 --> 00:45:59,914
Elder...

572
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,284
Elder...

573
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,262
Elder said he was cold

574
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,795
Cold?

575
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,057
Elder, you're overly exerting yourself

576
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,472
Have you seen Miss Windy?

577
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,873
No, I'm looking for her, too

578
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,741
Where did she go?

579
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,453
There's noise coming from upstairs
Let's go up for a look

580
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,840
Don't go up there

581
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,504
Strange! Nobody up here

582
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,113
Maybe it's next door
Let's go over and look

583
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,601
What are you doing?

584
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,261
Sister, Elder came back
to find me... us

585
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,770
Why are your clothes
so disheveled?

586
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,103
Don't be so impolite in the future

587
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,985
Miss Windy, this villa is haunted

588
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,218
Do we still have to
pretend to be ghosts?

589
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,914
No matter what, we must
wait here for father

590
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,992
We mustn't leave

591
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,186
In this moment of danger

592
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,728
we must thrust out our
chests and be fearless

593
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,128
We must be utterly
devoted to our cause

594
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,694
Elder, let's go in

595
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,362
Elder!
Thrust out our chests

596
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,134
Your clothes are torn in the back

597
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,795
How do you write the
"freeze" incantation?

598
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,799
I didn't spy on him

599
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,069
I didn't even know he was outside

600
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,077
Better tie your heart down

601
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,113
Otherwise, it might fly away!

602
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,808
If I could lie it down, I would!

603
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:05,533
This is how you do it... Freeze!

604
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,636
It works!

605
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,647
This is the "freeze" incantation

606
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:18,947
If you see that monster

607
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,714
do this and he'll freeze in his tracks

608
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:21,550
Like this?

609
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,091
Don't do it haphazardly
This spell is hard to reverse

610
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,593
Give me your hand. Yes!
