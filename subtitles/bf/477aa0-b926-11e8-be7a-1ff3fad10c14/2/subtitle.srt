1
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:12,896
Sister, what's that sound?

2
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:26,738
It's coming form up there.
Windy!

3
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:30,910
Windy, give me your hand

4
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:32,611
Elder, shouldn't you be
calling me Hsiao-tsing?

5
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:35,019
Whether I call you Hsiao-tsing or Windy
there's no need to be bashful

6
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:37,853
I'll never reveal
what happened just now

7
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:40,223
I was really anxious on your behalf

8
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:41,159
Actually, I kissed you because

9
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:43,891
I couldn't control myself

10
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,591
Fortunately you made a quick get-away

11
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:47,930
Otherwise, if Moon had seen
you undressed and with me...

12
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,937
it would be hard to explain
even if I were Elder Chu Kot

13
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:53,132
Give me your hand

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,675
Moon?!

15
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:58,507
Moon, what are you doing here?

16
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:00,014
I was looking for you

17
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:01,775
Don't bother explaining

18
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,283
Moon!

19
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:06,481
No! Windy! Give me your hand

20
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:10,422
We're not fated for each other
I'm betrothed to Lord Ma's son

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,922
You're betrothed?

22
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,062
We weren't meant for each other

23
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,357
You should be looking
for Moon, not me

24
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:21,867
Windy, one at a time
I'm after both of you

25
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:32,909
Miss Moon, it's getting dark
Give me your hand

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,179
Go to my sister instead

27
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,346
I'll go to her next
Quick, give me your hand

28
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:39,920
Elder, aren't you the playboy!

29
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,580
You can only choose one of us

30
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,692
I'm not going to
compete with my sister

31
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:46,090
No need to compete

32
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,162
When I finish with you I'll go to her

33
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:11,613
Elder, there is something
I must tell you

34
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,358
Actually, love is a strange thing

35
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,219
My heart beats wildly

36
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:19,692
when I look at you

37
00:02:19,863 --> 00:02:25,927
I don't even have the
courage to glance at you

38
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:32,631
I'm afraid that my heart
would jump right out

39
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:38,540
I'd be willing to die
if that's what you wanted

40
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:40,649
As long as I can be with you
forever and ever part

41
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,454
Help!

42
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:48,556
What's that?

43
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:50,886
Hurry up! That monster is back

44
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:54,561
Elder, what happened?

45
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:55,561
Go inside and search

46
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:56,790
Yes!

47
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:00,400
Inside there's a huge creature

48
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,094
I don't know what it is

49
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:12,814
Be calm! Use the "freeze" incantation
Together: Freeze!

50
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:15,815
Freeze!

51
00:03:18,621 --> 00:03:19,645
It really works!

52
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,417
It sure does!

53
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:31,164
We froze it in its tracks

54
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:40,067
Everybody, jump up there!

55
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:57,186
The archery machine!

56
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,209
Be careful, Elder!

57
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,762
Moon, go and rescue Elder
I'll lure away that monster

58
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,124
OK

59
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:42,666
Put out the net

60
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,136
Yes!

61
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:47,905
Your hand...

62
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:03,987
Let's retreat from here

63
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:11,792
See what's going on up ahead

64
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,026
Yes!

65
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:16,896
Soldiers!

66
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:18,597
Hu, they're set up an ambush

67
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,869
Windy, Moon?!

68
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:23,978
It's father!

69
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,910
Lure the soldiers into villa

70
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:27,208
Use the archery machine
to mow them down!

71
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,611
Yes!

72
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:32,781
Trying to get away?

73
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,248
The monster destroyed
the archery machine!

74
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:37,893
We're surrounded by our foes!

75
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,091
Let me out!

76
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:42,856
Right!... Let Elder go!

77
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:44,727
Elder, what should we do now?

78
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:45,833
We'll stay on the sidelines

79
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:48,197
When the enemy comes in, the monster
will deal with them

80
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:00,542
Obviously a fake ghost
Unmask it

81
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,251
Let's rescue father!
Yes!

82
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,195
You're hopelessly outnumbered

83
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:30,645
I'll save you!

84
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,016
Swords are too dangerous!

85
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:36,811
Let's use our fists

86
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,268
I told you that swords
are too dangerous!

87
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,617
Father

88
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,455
Get out of here
Don't worry about me!

89
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:21,329
That giant corpse ran over here

90
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,995
Don't worry about me!
Rescue father!

91
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,969
The monster is here!

92
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,645
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!

93
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,812
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!

94
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,919
Windy! Windy!

95
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,251
Possessed by evil spirits?!

96
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,255
Sister!

97
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:51,120
What happened to Windy?

98
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:52,124
She's been possessed
by evil spirits

99
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:53,353
What should we do?

100
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,056
Still a lot of soldiers around
Better get inside

101
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,903
Don't move!

102
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:03,771
Press down on her!

103
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,840
Sister!

104
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,533
Think of a way to save my sister

105
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,143
She's possessed by the den

106
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:11,337
She could turn into a
giant monster at any moment

107
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:13,072
It's your fault, you traitor!

108
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:14,841
I'll kill you!

109
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,747
Wait! His troops are still out there

110
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,513
We must keep him as a hostage

111
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:24,087
She's turning into a corpse monster!

112
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,120
Sister!

113
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:27,387
We must kill her immediately

114
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:28,359
Otherwise she'll turn into a monster

115
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:30,499
You can't kill her!

116
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,997
Are you a good person or evil?

117
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:33,601
You won't kill Hu, but
you'll kill my sister

118
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,704
Kill Hu!

119
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:38,239
No matter how many you kill here
you still won't save the kingdom

120
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,806
The emperor is surrounded
by sycophants

121
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,103
and has no idea of the
suffering of his people

122
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:44,712
Take my head to the emperor
Maybe it will move him

123
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,940
He'll be convinced of

124
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,048
our sincerity and loyalty

125
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:50,708
Father, if you die we'll
have no one to lead us

126
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,286
Take my head instead

127
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,946
No! Take our heads

128
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:57,456
Bastards! What good is it
to cut off your heads?

129
00:08:57,627 --> 00:08:59,151
Who are you, ordering people about?!

130
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,320
lam the learned
and brilliant Elder Chu Kot

131
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:05,226
The learned and
brilliant Elder Chu Kot!

132
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,035
Please guide us

133
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,733
None of you are permitted to die

134
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:15,707
Please explain!

135
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:16,867
Explain?!

136
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,877
Your severed heads will
mean nothing to the emperor

137
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,345
You'll have died in vain
Need I explain more?

138
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,983
Stupid pigs!

139
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:25,215
What about her?

140
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,526
Windy!

141
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:43,069
To exorcise her, she needs
a dose of "yang" energy

142
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,171
lam not powerful enough

143
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,170
We better do something soon

144
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,672
or it will be too late

145
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:47,935
What can we do?

146
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,442
Try this magic charm
It may or may not work

147
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:50,237
Try it

148
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:51,937
Hurry up and pull Miss Windy down
OK.

149
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:08,261
I order the evil spirits
to be exorcised

150
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:24,142
How did this happen?

151
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:25,974
Really ugly!

152
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:29,918
I've forced the evil spirit from her

153
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:32,554
If she gets a quick dose of "yang" energy,
there will be a gleam of hope

154
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:33,882
Hurry up

155
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:35,148
Hurry!

156
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,554
I'm a monk. I must not
get too close to women

157
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:39,695
Don't be afraid of her ugliness

158
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:40,794
How do we give her "yang" energy?

159
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,055
With your mouth, of course

160
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,220
Mouth?

161
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,991
What then. Your ears?

162
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:46,567
Send me to her

163
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:49,364
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!

164
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,689
Sister!

165
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:54,770
A real man is afraid of nothing

166
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,564
It's you!

167
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:22,722
Lord, a golden-robed priest

168
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,832
A golden-robed priest?

169
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:48,617
Lord!
Put your swords down!

170
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:55,327
Not enough! More!

171
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,456
Lower your swords!

172
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,325
Put all your swords down!

173
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:08,736
There are evildoers behind
every country's downfall

174
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:12,039
Take my head and collect your reward

175
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,417
The way that you look death
calmly in the face

176
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,752
proves that you are loyal
to our country

177
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:28,593
Even though our political
views are different

178
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,790
I'm still willing to help you

179
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:33,192
The golden-robed Taoist outside

180
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,929
is the High Priest

181
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,697
The High Priest?

182
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:40,398
All the rites and
rituals in the palace...

183
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,874
the emperor consults
him for guidance

184
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:46,572
If he speaks on your behalf
justice will triumph

185
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:48,875
Father!

186
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,250
Lord Fu, if you trust me

187
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:55,581
let me go to him

188
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:58,090
I'll explain the true situation

189
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,328
Father, he might betray you!

190
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:08,368
He could have killed me
had he wanted to

191
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,942
Still not awake?!

192
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:18,976
Enough! I'm going to puke

193
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:23,746
Elder!

194
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:29,487
Ning!

195
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:59,143
lam here to pay my
respects to the high priest

196
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:02,286
Lord Fu is not a traitor

197
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,892
He is a loyal subject, a patriot

198
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,028
I hope that you will uphold justice

199
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,894
There are many who cannot
tell between good and evil

200
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,262
They do not know the hardships
of the imperial court

201
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:17,429
The purpose of myjourney
is to pacify the people

202
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:21,235
I'll intercede at court

203
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,843
on behalf of these loyal subjects

204
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,172
Amen! Amen!

205
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:25,870
Thank you, High Priest!

206
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,702
How are you, Autumn?

207
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,509
Women are very tempting
If I didn't exercise self-control...

208
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,944
my energy would have been dissipated

209
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:07,149
Hu is treacherous and disrupts
the High Priest's harmony

210
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,688
Please stay here

211
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,044
The convict Lord Fu is here
to see the High Priest

212
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:39,016
I pay my respect to the High Priest

213
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:42,988
Amen! Amen!
You have a murderous air about you

214
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:46,958
Put down your weapons

215
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:50,424
I've been framed, but I am
concerned about our nation

216
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:54,160
You are so merciful

217
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,564
Guide the emperor to save the nation

218
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:58,969
Life is chaotic

219
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:03,237
Mistakes can always be corrected

220
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,214
In my former life I was evil

221
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:49,153
sol must do good in this life

222
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:53,856
Release my soul from purgatory

223
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:58,693
Release my soul from purgatory

224
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:11,770
Evil chanting?!

225
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:15,409
Don't be tricked!

226
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:17,450
Sit down!

227
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:21,556
His mercy is false! Don't be tricked
by his devilish voice!

228
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:26,519
Abracadabra! Freeze!

229
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:33,935
I order the evil spirits
to be exorcised!

230
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:52,543
lam the absolute Buddha

231
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:55,381
What kind of evil spirit are you!

232
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:58,924
Even before Buddha you refuse
to reveal your true appearance!

233
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,055
The spirit of evil?!
lam whatl look like!

234
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,529
I don't believe you are Buddha!

235
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,689
Let's go over and see
if you're real or false

236
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:07,062
Don't

237
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:22,181
Abracadabra!
Hocus pocus!

238
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:41,067
Elder!

239
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:42,931
The bastard Hu betrayed us

240
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:44,697
I'll take care of things here
Leave quickly!

241
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:49,003
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!
The universe revolves

242
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:57,377
May Buddha be in your heart

243
00:19:57,553 --> 00:20:00,716
I knew he was false, but
couldn't conquer him

244
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:02,717
I failed!

245
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:07,285
I can't perform my magic
with you here

246
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:10,054
I'll open a tunnel in the earth for you
Hurry!

247
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:18,196
Autumn!

248
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:20,898
Hurry up!

249
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:22,600
I can't hold out

250
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,177
Hurry!

251
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,976
Abracadabra! Hurry!

252
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:30,512
Autumn!

253
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,348
Father!

254
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:53,936
They've escaped for now but I'll
get them in the end

255
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:55,804
Guard the three we've captured!

256
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,445
Yes!

257
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,249
What about Lord Fu?

258
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:09,583
They have admitted their errors
They have departed

259
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:12,090
People should acknowledge
the immensity of the universe

260
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,922
I just heard a fight going on

261
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:17,088
Your ears aren't clean!

262
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,928
Vacate your mind to attain

263
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:22,229
perfect peace of mind

264
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:23,758
I'm very cold

265
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:01,328
Hsiao-tsing!

266
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:10,411
Don't leave me!

267
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,692
Hsiao-tsing!

268
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:33,463
Don't be reincarnated so soon

269
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,002
It's too hard to be mortal now

270
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,571
You're so good to Hsiao-tsing

271
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:42,437
I never realized how
much you missed her!

272
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:45,838
I never realized
how much you missed her!

273
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:52,173
Frost fills the sky
over Ten Mile Lake

274
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:55,680
Silken threads anxious of youth

275
00:24:57,386 --> 00:25:00,617
Looking at the moon and feeling lonely

276
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:04,316
Envious of lovers, not of immortality

277
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:08,986
Envious of lovers, not of immortality

278
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,836
Hsiao-tsing!

279
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:29,774
Hsiao-tsing, what are you doing here?

280
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,020
Hide! You can't let
the sun shine on you!

281
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:33,814
If the sun shines on you
your soul will be scattered

282
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,822
You would never be reincarnated!

283
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:38,289
Why don't you listen to me?

284
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,257
Hsiao-tsing!

285
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,835
Oh, it's you! I'm sorry

286
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:49,800
Once again I've made a mistake

287
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,068
I mistook you for she

288
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,543
So there really
is someone named Hsiao-tsing!

289
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:01,705
Is she the one in the painting?

290
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:03,945
Do you miss her very much?

291
00:26:04,753 --> 00:26:07,244
She's already dead and buried

292
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:09,951
We'll never meat again

293
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:16,224
If you want, you can
call me Hsiao-tsing for now

294
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:18,059
For now?

295
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:26,206
I understand
You're betrothed to another

296
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:28,941
When I knew Hsiao-tsing

297
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:31,909
she was also betrothed to somebody else

298
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:33,978
It's beyond my control

299
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,678
Hsiao-tsing said exactly the thing

300
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:49,228
You are mortal; she's a ghost

301
00:26:50,031 --> 00:26:51,999
But you're both exactly the same

302
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:57,734
Are we very much alike?

303
00:26:57,906 --> 00:27:00,636
Too much so

304
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,209
You gave me false hope

305
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:06,713
Anyway, false hope is
better than none

306
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:11,643
Excuse me!

307
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:16,352
Here's your tea

308
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:18,421
Your meal will be served presently

309
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,322
Please make yourselves at home

310
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,733
I've seen that man before
He's...

311
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:32,564
The tea is poisoned!
This inn is run by thieves!

312
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:33,503
Really!

313
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:34,232
Is the water boiling?

314
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:35,068
Yes

315
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:36,141
The blade sharpened?

316
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:37,039
Nice and sharp

317
00:27:37,212 --> 00:27:38,110
Everything's ready

318
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,406
Put the man in the
cauldron immediately

319
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:42,516
Save the woman for tonight
to warm our could beds

320
00:27:42,884 --> 00:27:44,909
Kill!

321
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,449
Slice them up good!

322
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:53,924
Right on!

323
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:58,863
Stop!

324
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:02,562
Watch where

325
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:04,534
you're stabbing!

326
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:08,942
They escaped through the window

327
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:23,817
It's dangerous here
This is no way to escape!

328
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:28,494
Betterjump into the tree and hide

329
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,559
I still haven't recovered
No energy to jump

330
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:36,566
Don't worry about me. Run!

331
00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:38,262
No. I won't leave you

332
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,541
This time there's no escape!

333
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:45,339
I never thought we'd die here

334
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:48,073
Elder, it's our fault
for getting you involved

335
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:50,641
I'm not Elder Chu Kot

336
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,344
I'm just a poor scholar

337
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:55,317
No matter who you are...

338
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,787
I feel fortunate to die

339
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,755
with the one I love

340
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,595
We'll never be parted again

341
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,832
We'll never be parted again
Hold me!

342
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:22,541
Let me be on the outside so that
the wolf eats me first

343
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:25,580
You're wonderful

344
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:29,980
So are you

345
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:32,156
If we could be like this forever
it would be great

346
00:30:07,095 --> 00:30:11,191
Orchid Temple!

347
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:12,162
Orchid Temple!

348
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:13,767
What's the Orchid Temple?

349
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:19,230
How could I have forgotten about Yin?

350
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:21,102
Who is he?

351
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:22,436
The bearded man in the Orchid Temple

352
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,668
A wizard in the occult

353
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:25,972
If we find him, we can deal
with the High Priest

354
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:41,225
Isn't the High Priest returning
to the capital city?

355
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:43,526
Why go to his palace?

356
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,694
He needs a tranquil place

357
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,391
to meditate

358
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,344
Only holy people may enter this
sacred place. Stay where you are

359
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,632
This is the hour of the eclipse

360
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:31,537
My body is changing against my wish

361
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:52,929
Why are all the officials
of the imperial court here?

362
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:05,412
Lord Chiang! Lord Yang! Lord Lee!

363
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:08,138
I was escorting Lord Fu

364
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:09,248
back to the capital...

365
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:12,113
But couldn't complete my mission
Allow me to explain

366
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:17,451
Lord Chiang!

367
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:21,193
A hollow shell?

368
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:25,299
Lord Yang is a hollow shell, too?

369
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:26,866
What kind of a place is this?

370
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:28,059
Are you demons?

371
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:29,760
What did you do with the flesh

372
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:31,633
and blood of these officials?

373
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:39,139
You demons, come out and face me!

374
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:45,744
Why did you do this to
the imperial officials?

375
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,911
What evil intentions do you harbor?

376
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,990
Are they all hollow shells?!

377
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,484
I'm going to destroy

378
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,288
all of you evil monks

379
00:33:02,537 --> 00:33:04,937
Strange, where have they hidden?

380
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:21,414
Autumn? Moon? Lord Fu?

381
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:24,217
Lord Fu!

382
00:33:26,494 --> 00:33:28,928
What happened?
Where are the others?

383
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,956
I was wrong to believe you!
You've caused so much harm!

384
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:32,963
What other plots do you
have up your sleeve?

385
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:35,659
We were tricked
The High Priest is a demon!

386
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:38,032
He turned many officials
into walking corpses

387
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,403
We must report this to the emperor

388
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:42,338
Otherwise, the kingdom will
be beyond redemption

389
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,107
Oh, he's the one who
instigated this calamity!

390
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,769
No wonder the court is in upheaval

391
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:47,505
We must hurry to rescue the others
We can talk later

392
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:53,414
Moon!

393
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,122
Dad!

394
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:02,662
Autumn!

395
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:05,222
There are demons in the court

396
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,560
so I must get involved in affairs of state

397
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:08,429
Everyone must do his bit

398
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:10,631
Hurry! There's danger everywhere

399
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:12,329
Let's get past this hurdle first

400
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:15,000
These demonic monks have
great magical powers

401
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,201
Once he's awake we won't
be able to escape, so hurry!

402
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:20,408
Autumn, get out of here!
Don't fight anymore!

403
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:23,346
This is a scene of desolation

404
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,042
Lord, ride my horse

405
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:29,315
More chanting!

406
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,081
Father!

407
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:31,725
I'll use my powers to
help you concentrate

408
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:35,253
Come back, Hu. You'll never beat him

409
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:52,773
Put down your butchers' knives
Bow before Buddha!

410
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,437
Hu, don't sacrifice
yourself in vain!

411
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,978
I mistakenly trusted these demons
and slaughtered righteous officials

412
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,310
To atone for my sins

413
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:04,951
I'll fight him to the death

414
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:08,249
Don't!

415
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:10,948
I'm headed for hell anyway

416
00:36:15,263 --> 00:36:16,321
Hu!

417
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,394
Yin, why does the wind suddenly
blow so violently?

418
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,504
It's hard to tell which
direction is which

419
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,470
Yin, what should we do?

420
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:28,074
Evil spirits pervade this road

421
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:29,937
Our lives hang by a slender thread

422
00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:32,102
We mustn't stop. Follow me!

423
00:36:41,756 --> 00:36:44,020
Oh, boundless heaven and earth
Help me!

424
00:36:52,667 --> 00:37:08,447
Recite the scriptures with me!
Prajna paramita...

425
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,208
The Diamond Sutra incantation?

426
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,615
Prajna paramita...

427
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:19,956
Ignoramus, behaving so
boorishly in front of me!

428
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:22,022
Prajna paramite...

429
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,294
Ning, Windy. Get out of the way!

430
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,765
Oh, boundless heaven and earth
Help me!

431
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:40,942
Buddha is present!

432
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:48,080
If you dare to impersonate Buddha
What would you not dare to do?

433
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,121
You think you can hoodwink
the people forever?

434
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,282
You think you can hoodwink
the people forever?

435
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,754
I'm going to let everyone know

436
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:55,896
what you really are!

437
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,896
The masses love to
worship their idols

438
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:02,092
Why set yourself
against the people?

439
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,965
It's their ignorance

440
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:05,469
that has allowed you to succeed

441
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,107
I'll never let them
worship demons like you

442
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:08,503
You'll never deceive
the people again!

443
00:38:08,676 --> 00:38:12,510
If you refuse to follow
my shining beacon...

444
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,978
you will be destroyed!

445
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:20,719
What crap! Look out!

446
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:28,387
Justice for all!

447
00:38:36,737 --> 00:38:38,261
Swords are part of the infinite!

448
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:46,813
We've only destroyed
the false outer body

449
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:47,948
He can come back and
attack us at any time

450
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:49,844
We must use our swords to fight back!

451
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:52,485
Let me introduce myself
I'm from the Kunlun sect...

452
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:54,120
At a time like this, let's
not separate into sects

453
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:56,654
We're all fighting the same enemy
Destroy this demon!

454
00:38:56,824 --> 00:38:57,756
Chant with me!

455
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:14,035
Prajna paramita...

456
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:32,088
Prajna paramita...

457
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:35,358
The old demon has stolen into the earth
and broken through our ring of swords

458
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:36,996
What should we do?

459
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:38,426
Watch!

460
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:42,130
What kind of demon?

461
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:43,565
Come with me!

462
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,936
Hold on to me as I fly

463
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:55,806
Ning!

464
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,549
You pulled my sleeve off

465
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:05,583
What are you coming back for?

466
00:40:07,662 --> 00:40:09,357
What happened?

467
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,019
Gone?

468
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:11,596
Keep quiet!

469
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:19,765
Be careful
The demon has changed its appearance

470
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:29,409
It's huge!

471
00:40:34,188 --> 00:40:35,416
Be careful!

472
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:46,393
Moon, look after your father
I'll help Yin

473
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:48,532
Autumn, be careful!

474
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,228
The demon's actually
a giant centipede!

475
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:53,237
That worm can never be a dragon

476
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:54,874
Elder!

477
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,039
Elder!

478
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:04,881
I've never had to deal with

479
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:06,542
such a giant creature

480
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:07,517
What should we do now?

481
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:09,747
Pierce the crown of its head

482
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,233
Ning!

483
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:25,997
Ning!

484
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:32,771
Windy!

485
00:41:40,855 --> 00:41:43,255
The flying sword!

486
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:25,963
Prajna paramite!

487
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:30,603
Exorcise the demons!

488
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:37,304
Oh, boundless heaven and earth
Help me!

489
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:46,946
Elder!

490
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:48,247
Autumn!

491
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:51,783
Two heads are better than one

492
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:54,291
Abracadabra. Hocus pocus

493
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:03,369
Hocus pocus

494
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,403
I've been in the Orchid Temple
for so long...

495
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:40,403
I didn't know the world

496
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:42,940
was so full of devils and demons

497
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,543
It's hard to separate
the living from the deed

498
00:43:44,712 --> 00:43:47,044
The world is in chaos

499
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:48,938
It's a good thing you hid
in the Orchid Temple

500
00:43:49,116 --> 00:43:51,550
Otherwise I might never
have found you

501
00:43:52,086 --> 00:43:53,383
We share the same ideals...

502
00:43:53,554 --> 00:43:55,579
We should roam this world together
and fight forjustice

503
00:43:55,756 --> 00:43:57,121
We should work together

504
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:58,553
What are you saying?

505
00:43:58,726 --> 00:44:00,694
I've always led a
solitary existence

506
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:01,850
Last time, I almost died

507
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:03,724
trying to help you save Hsiao-tsing

508
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:05,490
This time, I've helped you
battle the demons...

509
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:06,598
and almost lost my life

510
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:08,200
It's better if we go our own ways

511
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:11,497
When you need my help
I'll return and save you

512
00:44:20,514 --> 00:44:22,004
Be careful, Autumn!

513
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:26,745
The demon still isn't dead

514
00:44:27,054 --> 00:44:28,783
Autumn!

515
00:44:29,256 --> 00:44:31,690
I really need your help this time
or I'm finished

516
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,491
We must bejinxed!

517
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,490
I'll take care of things!
Quickly, craw!

518
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:37,824
No good

519
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:40,591
Autumn!

520
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:45,866
Autumn!

521
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,064
That centipede flew over!

522
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:48,731
What about Autumn and Yin?

523
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:51,868
We're locked in. We must think
of a way to escape

524
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:56,344
You're right!
I've really caused you here

525
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:04,820
Our bodies are restrained. We can be
saved only if our souls can escape

526
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,357
Souls?

527
00:45:06,527 --> 00:45:07,994
Will we have enough energy

528
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:10,596
to later let the sols back in?

529
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:12,262
This is the only way!

530
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:14,867
Chant along with me

531
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:20,999
The spirit of Buddha conquers all!

532
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:24,508
The spirit of Buddha conquers all!

533
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:28,813
Goodness is indestructible

534
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:33,443
Goodness is indestructible

535
00:45:40,227 --> 00:45:41,854
Prajna paramite. Abracadabra!

536
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:44,224
Abracadatra! Hocus pocus!

537
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:49,398
Oh, boundless heaven and earth
Help me!

538
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:17,987
Autumn!

539
00:46:23,203 --> 00:46:25,137
Yin!

540
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:27,072
Yin!

541
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:28,936
Soul, return!

542
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:34,110
Soul, return!

543
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:36,514
My soul can't return to my body!

544
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,242
Autumn, catch the soul!

545
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,445
Autumn!

546
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,627
His power isn't strong enough
I'll help him

547
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:49,956
Prajna paramite...

548
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:52,598
I can't catch it

549
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:53,959
Moon!

550
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:55,567
Autumn!

551
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:07,844
Too late!

552
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,885
Autumn!

553
00:48:42,142 --> 00:48:43,166
What's all the hubbub outside?

554
00:48:43,343 --> 00:48:45,436
What hubbub?
I don't hear anything!

555
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:06,795
Who's getting married?
Such a large golden pig!

556
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:11,027
It's a gift to Lord Fu
from the emperor

557
00:49:12,072 --> 00:49:14,404
Since he exposed the traitors
in the imperial court

558
00:49:14,575 --> 00:49:15,872
he performed a great
service for the emperor

559
00:49:16,043 --> 00:49:19,308
It's a wedding gift
for Lord Fu's daughter

560
00:49:22,082 --> 00:49:23,606
Moon!

561
00:49:24,718 --> 00:49:26,913
Moon!

562
00:49:27,187 --> 00:49:29,121
Ning!

563
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:37,293
Is Windy getting...

564
00:49:37,464 --> 00:49:38,726
Sister is already married

565
00:49:38,899 --> 00:49:41,424
Don't cause her any trouble

566
00:49:42,803 --> 00:49:43,827
I'm about to start on a journey

567
00:49:44,004 --> 00:49:47,838
Give her my best wishes
for a happy marriage

568
00:49:50,477 --> 00:49:54,004
I will. Take care of yourself

569
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:05,986
Adieu!

570
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:22,137
It's hard to differentiate

571
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:24,174
between true and false hopes

572
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:27,802
Now I understand why you stay
away from our mortal world

573
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:31,508
Mortals are forgetful
Good deeds fade like the wind

574
00:50:31,685 --> 00:50:35,416
No matter what you've done
it's soon forgotten

575
00:50:35,656 --> 00:50:37,590
Is forgetting good or bad?

576
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:40,192
Should we have hopes?

577
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:49,161
Windy?!

578
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,405
You said you'd cherish no hope!

579
00:50:56,209 --> 00:50:58,973
Sister, don't hesitate!
Go to him!

580
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:07,076
Windy?!

581
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:08,846
Ning!

582
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:12,256
Let's go, hurry!

583
00:51:13,226 --> 00:51:14,352
You go back

584
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:15,859
Farewell!

585
00:51:16,096 --> 00:51:17,188
Take care!

586
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:19,159
Let's go!
