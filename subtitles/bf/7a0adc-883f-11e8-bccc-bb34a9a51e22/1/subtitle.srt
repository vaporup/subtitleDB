7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,098
SURPRISE

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,331
They're like nail clippers

9
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,569
No, they're exactly like
ramen noodle soup

10
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,313
You two don't know
about men yet

11
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,543
Hey, men don't always
have to be around

12
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:56,086
Like nail clippers,
you only need them sometimes

13
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,349
When you're lonely
or bored, that is

14
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,790
No, they're like
ramen noodle soup

15
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,657
Always making you decide
whether to drink it or not

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,229
That's men for you

17
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,265
You guys are still clueless

18
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:11,030
Gotta meet a sexy gentleman
like my Jung-woo

19
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:15,938
What? Does his chest pop out
when he flexes it?

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,267
No, not that

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,413
When my Jung-woo
drinks cola,

22
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,616
his adam's apple
goes up and down

23
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,709
It drives me wild
I can't wait till tomorrow

24
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,387
You're really hopeless

25
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,793
Hey, do you remember
when Du-hyung

26
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,952
said your nails were pretty?

27
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,860
Why'd you have to bring
him up? We're through

28
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,327
That's what you think,
but not him

29
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,727
Throw away everything
he gave you

30
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,840
Or else you'll have
bad luck forever

31
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,933
I already did

32
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,240
Wait!

33
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,785
You two look cute together

34
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,454
Oh, it's nothing

35
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,065
- Hello
- Hello

36
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,861
Don't forget I'm leaving
early tomorrow morning

37
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,505
- That's important, so hold on to it safely
- Yes, ma'am

38
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,806
- Ha-young
- Yes?

39
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,908
- You've a customer downstairs
- Really?

40
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,279
It's her third time today

41
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,717
Ha-young, what should
I really wear tomorrow?

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,691
Lucky wrench

43
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,920
They're all nice,
so throw on anything

44
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,827
How can I just
put on anything?

45
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,662
Tomorrow is more important
than an engagement party

46
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,963
I better go, too
I can't waste any time

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,609
I see it's your third time

48
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,807
- What don't you like now?
- Well…

49
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,213
I don't think
this really suits me

50
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,880
Fix it to match
my style and not yours

51
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,225
Is that so hard to do?
Do it again

52
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,629
Give me the drape

53
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,062
I'm so sorry, ma'am

54
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,216
Everything okay?
Just wait a little longer

55
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,190
How is it?

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,618
Do you like it?

57
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,534
Hey, did you take the
manager's shopping bag?

58
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,268
I must've taken
everything by mistake

59
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,442
Should I bring it over?

60
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,027
I guess we'll have
a slumber party

61
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,629
- See you soon, Ha-young
- Bye

62
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,943
Mi-ryoung, this picture…

63
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,679
Who's the foreigner with
Jung-woo in this picture?

64
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,496
Ha-young, I'd like it if you'd
bring my bag to the airport

65
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,427
You can, right?

66
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,536
Then see you at the lobby
at 8:30 in the morning

67
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,842
Wanna drink just one beer?

68
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,112
No, my face will
get bloated tomorrow

69
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,852
Forget it!
You're unfair

70
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,289
- What should I really wear tomorrow?
- Don't know

71
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,519
What would you wear
if you were me?

72
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,056
Am I you?

73
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,660
Nothing extravagant

74
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,130
What you wore when you
first met him or kissed him

75
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,900
It's more special that way

76
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,742
It's coming to me…

77
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,604
But all I remember
is down to my neck

78
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,941
- I don't remember
- Give me a break

79
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,144
Ha-young, it's such
a mystery to me

80
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,485
How a selfish person like me
can meet an awesome guy

81
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,217
He's a gift from heaven
to make you into a person

82
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,864
- When I first…
- Ha-young,

83
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,060
it's a bad omen

84
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,198
It's just a thread
Don't worry

85
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,271
Why do you always
believe in superstitions?

86
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,672
You know,

87
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:24,412
doing his own thing,
nice, fun, tall,

88
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:30,217
with a small butt,
never wastes his time,

89
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,348
and knows how to wait
until the girl wants a kiss

90
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,024
If I had that kind of guy,
I'd fall right for him

91
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,592
Then why don't you
ask a factory

92
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,862
- to make you one
- Hey!

93
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:48,603
Think that kind of guy
just falls from the sky?

94
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,372
While going out,
you have to change him

95
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,880
Does Jung-woo
speak Korean well?

96
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,321
Yeah, he went to
elementary school here,

97
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,361
and he came to Korea
often because of work

98
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,166
Jung-woo's arriving
in the morning, not at night

99
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,104
- Is the party all ready?
- Yeah, the rest is up

100
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,412
Then bring me to the airport
early tomorrow morning

101
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,584
You can pick up Jung-woo,
and spend the day with him

102
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,514
Great idea!

103
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,622
Let's hurry and go to bed

104
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,350
I need to get my
beauty sleep for tomorrow

105
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,748
Just meeting him
over dinner is enough

106
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,508
But who cares
about a stupid party

107
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,714
It's not just a party,
it's a surprise party

108
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,754
What kind of nonsense
is that?

109
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,758
She may look like an adult,

110
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,020
but she needs to grow up
She acts like a 17 year old

111
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,289
We did well
at sending her abroad

112
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,693
He has a doctorate from MlT,
and he's successful

113
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,938
Is it so hard to play into
her hands just for once?

114
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,439
Must've been hard to raise
a kid alone

115
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,576
- in a foreign land
- In a foreign land?

116
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,476
Jung-woo's mom
is a Hawaiian native

117
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,208
What?

118
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,751
So Jung-woo is…

119
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,082
a half-breed?

120
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,633
Mom? What is it?

121
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,000
What?
What did dad say?

122
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,405
Really?
This isn't happening

123
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,950
Dad said everything is off

124
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,360
This isn't happening

125
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,426
I can't give both of them up

126
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,663
Neither Jung-woo,
nor his birthday party

127
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,205
- Ha-young
- Yeah?

128
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,910
You're all that
I can count on,

129
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,645
you know
Be careful with the car

130
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,855
I'm sorry it's so early

131
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,989
Well until I convince my dad,
you have to stick with him

132
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,027
Remember what he looks like?
Hurry and get in

133
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,025
I remembered everything
You'll miss both of them

134
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,159
If I miss the manager,
I'm dead

135
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,852
Wang Ha-young,
this is unforgivable

136
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,652
You can't get
a single thing right

137
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,056
When I get back,
we need to talk

138
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,262
What time is it?

139
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,178
- Hello?
- It's me, Cha Du-hyung

140
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,283
Don't hang up

141
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,684
Make sure you
don't scratch my car

142
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,222
- It's only a month old
- Hey!

143
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,723
He has Jang Dong-gun's eyes,
Cha Tae-hyun's lips, and his

144
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:09,886
throat is sexy

145
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,954
- How do you expect me
- to find him like that?

146
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,293
His height is average,
and he'll wear a yellow jacket

147
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,925
I told him to wear it
when he meets my parents

148
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,141
- I'm sorry
- Well…

149
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,823
- Ohiogosaimas
- Oh, hi

150
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,632
- Hello?
- Find him?

151
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,763
Not yet

152
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,899
He'll have a Louis Vuitton
suitcase I bought him

153
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,773
There'll also be
a yellow bear attached to it

154
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,210
You can't miss it

155
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,384
What should I do?

156
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,515
- Oh no!
- How foolish of me

157
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,183
I'm so sorry

158
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,725
I spoiled your clothes

159
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,428
How could I be so clumsy

160
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,296
This is the second time

161
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,134
I was in a rush
looking for someone earlier

162
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,343
I'm really sorry about before

163
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,405
Your clothes are ruined

164
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,282
It looks expensive,
and I've stained it

165
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,941
I'm so sorry,

166
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,643
- How foolish of me
- Guess it needs a wash

167
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,486
Right! The cleaners!

168
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,627
Hurry and take it off, okay?
I'll get it cleaned for you

169
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,626
I'm so clumsy

170
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,330
Don't worry,
it'll be done soon

171
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:05,036
Plus, the new machines
work really fast lately

172
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,239
Mister, how long would
it take to wash this?

173
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,770
About thirty minutes

174
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,275
- Thirty?
- Yes

175
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,605
That's fast

176
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,374
- Then please hurry up
- lt'll be quick

177
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,158
- Mister, thirty minutes is all?
- Pardon?

178
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,191
Mister, …

179
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,525
wash this jacket last

180
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,995
- You're probably backed up
- Why?

181
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,732
This jacket

182
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,242
He left his pocketbook

183
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,977
It's my boyfriend's

184
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,752
We just fought
and he's upset

185
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,145
If he leaves with that jacket,
we're through

186
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,689
What should we do?
It'll take two hours to wash

187
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,319
What?

188
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,029
Can't you do it
a little faster, mister?

189
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,133
Just give it to me

190
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,850
- Give it
- It's already in the wash

191
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,128
Thank you

192
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,150
How is he?

193
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,220
Is he as cool as
Mi-ryoung said?

194
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,122
Is his adam's apple that big?

195
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,729
He's not cool

196
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,225
And I don't have time
to look at his throat

197
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,728
Think it's easy to hold on to
a guy I met for the first time?

198
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,065
You're really working hard

199
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,841
If that's how you
worked here,

200
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,672
you'd have your own
salon by now

201
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,474
If it's anything
for a friend,

202
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,378
you'd practically give up
your organs

203
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,443
I gotta go

204
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,676
This also would
look good on you

205
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,541
- What are you doing here?
- What?

206
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,020
Just that I'm really sorry

207
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,986
Because of me
your clothes got ruined

208
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,723
If you're that sorry,
then buy me another

209
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,827
Tell me what you think

210
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,736
It's nice

211
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,205
But that color

212
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:40,677
would look
better on a taller guy

213
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,817
Thanks for helping me
pick one out

214
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,359
Wait!

215
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,660
Although I couldn't pay
for the jacket,

216
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,061
can I take you
to Seoul at least?

217
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,733
- I'm headed there anyway
- That's okay

218
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,470
I'll give you a ride!

219
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,241
Just that I'm
so sorry about before

220
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,768
Anyway, weren't you
looking for someone?

221
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,082
Pardon? Right

222
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,475
I found him

223
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,885
Please let go

224
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,215
Wang Ha-yeo?

225
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,883
Wang Ha-young
It's my name

226
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,887
Ah, the event organizers
are coming at ten

227
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,157
- Okay
- Let's go mom

228
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,527
- Mi-ryoung wait
- Hurry

229
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,259
- My goodness

230
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,951
- Hello?
- What happened?

231
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,390
Everything is fine, ma'am

232
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,292
Ha-young,
he must be next to you

233
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,431
Thank you
Thanks so much, Ha-young

234
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,059
- Words won't be enough
- lsn't my Jung-woo great?

235
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,606
You must be nervous to have
such a great guy with you

236
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,265
Well they say
love blinds people

237
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,943
I'm telling you, you don't
know how to see men

238
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,780
Where are you now?

239
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,509
Right, I'm on
my way to Seoul

240
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,114
Already? No!

241
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,282
I'm on my way to see my dad
He can't go to my house yet

242
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,822
- You're right
- Whatever you do, hold him back till seven

243
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,965
Keep him away
from my house

244
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,101
Hurry and take a detour I'll take
responsibility for everything

245
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,037
I understand

246
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,901
I'm turning off my phone,
so call my mom if it's urgent

247
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,336
- I'll send you the number
- Okay

248
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,066
Wait!

249
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,780
Oh, I'm so sorry

250
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,917
No matter what,
my answer's no

251
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,888
- A Hawaiian native is out of the question
- Honey!

252
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,694
Honey, try to reconsider

253
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,123
- Let's go, Mr. Choi
- Honey

254
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,073
- What did dad say?
- It's no use

255
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,039
Your dad's right

256
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,734
Forget Jung-woo,
and find someone else

257
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,638
I'll help you find someone

258
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,180
Is this the right way
to Seoul?

259
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,455
I think so

260
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,463
Huh? What's this?

261
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,200
- Ha-young
- Yes?

262
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,945
It's wonderful!

263
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,983
Why are we here?

264
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,356
To sightsee for a bit

265
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,565
Can't see a beach
like this in Seoul

266
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,866
Look at those fishermen!
It looks so fun!

267
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,571
Been to a place like this?

268
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,767
- No
- Well, there you go

269
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,236
Wow, it's so great!
So is the air

270
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,982
It's so wonderful!

271
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,210
Let's go

272
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,220
Where are you going now?

273
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,332
To the restroom
I'll be right back

274
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,686
What are you doing there?

275
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,085
What took you so long?

276
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,585
Wow What kind of
boat is this?

277
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,428
Looks like you can
go on top of it

278
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,234
Let's go

279
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,662
After I look at it a bit
It's mysterious

280
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,009
Wow, it's so cool

281
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,576
- I don't have much time
- All right

282
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,518
I'll give you a ride
no matter what

283
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,517
Don't worry about it
Huh? What's this?

284
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,896
What could this be?

285
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,640
Ha-young
Aren't we going?

286
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,043
We are

287
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,511
Big trouble
I dropped something

288
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,444
What should I do?

289
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,551
What did you drop?

290
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,155
- The car keys
- What?

291
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,931
Can you get it for me?

292
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,934
If we don't have the key,
we can't go to Seoul

293
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,638
Be careful

294
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,179
Ouch! It hurts!

295
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,390
- Ha-young, Ha-young
- I got a splinter in my finger!

296
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,321
- Open The door!
- It hurts bad

297
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,482
Pull!

298
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,186
- That's not
- Do something!

299
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,787
It seems to be broken
Damn it!

300
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,197
It's not budging at all

301
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,601
But we're in such a rush
Right?

302
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,669
Ha-young! Ha-young!

303
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,494
Excuse me

304
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,699
You're supposed
to hold it for me

305
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,380
It opens with no problem

306
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,284
But it didn't budge
at all before

307
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,393
- What is it?
- Pardon?

308
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,556
On your face

309
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,741
There's some here, too

310
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,614
Let's go

311
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,814
That's too bad

312
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,581
You should've been careful

313
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,986
Anything in the car
to wipe it off?

314
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:50,184
I can't believe this
My clothes are ruined

315
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,723
Here
Change into this

316
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,200
But it's not mine

317
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:05,072
Thank you very much, sir

318
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,255
- Have some
- Thank you

319
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,559
Huh?
It's warm

320
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,761
I warmed them up
on the radiator

321
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,401
It's not that dirty
Put this on, too

322
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,207
Thanks

323
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,048
Oh no

324
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,519
What should I do?

325
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,358
I'm sorry, but I have
to go back to the airport

326
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,156
Why?

327
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,931
I think I left my pocketbook
in my jacket

328
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,796
Sure thing then

329
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,753
Give me your approval

330
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,359
Put it down

331
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,261
Now!

332
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,591
Wait

333
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,513
Caramel jacket, Asiana 720,
8:00 a.m., New York

334
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,659
Seron Data System, Co

335
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,731
- It's not done yet?
- No

336
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:52,996
Mister, I think I left
something in my jacket

337
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,234
But I didn't find anything

338
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,298
If it's that important,

339
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,206
how about looking for it
slowly from the entrance?

340
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,005
If you look in
every nook and cranny,

341
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,980
you'll find it for sure
Even if it takes all day

342
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,756
If she goes this far,
you should forgive her

343
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,489
- Are you a man or what?
- Pardon?

344
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:28,665
- Bye
- I'll give you a ride

345
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,964
No thanks

346
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,209
I'd take you to Seoul
Let's go to the parking lot

347
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:39,707
Well, I shouldn't keep riding
with a person I don't know

348
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,579
Riding with a person
you don't know?

349
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,623
If you just ride with me,
I'll take you there this time

350
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,357
This time?

351
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,734
Wait!

352
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,669
Please don't go,
and ride with me

353
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,378
Sure then

354
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,509
But Ha-young,

355
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,284
are you a fast runner
by any chance?

356
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,349
Pardon?

357
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,193
Wait!
Hey, where are you going?

358
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,563
Wait!
Where are you going?

359
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,566
Hey!

360
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,063
Stop! Stop!

361
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,375
- Is this the bus?
- Yes, sir!

362
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,746
Sorry folks for this
sudden interruption

363
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,988
Miss, where is he?

364
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,304
Something terrible
could've happened

365
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,307
Right after you left,
I found it at the airport

366
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,138
It's very important, right?

367
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,414
Miss!

368
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,415
Excuse me, sirs

369
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:04,423
Sorry, I really have
to hold on him

370
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,798
I'll take you
all the way to Seoul

371
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,905
No, it's okay
Please hurry

372
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,738
Hop in

373
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:36,224
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes?

374
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:44,034
Why do you keep
doing this?

375
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,537
Because I feel so sorry

376
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,007
Is that really all?

377
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,306
Yes, that's all

378
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,245
By any chance, is it because
you're interested in me?

379
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:09,024
You're right
Satisfied?

380
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:54,471
Why does that car
keep following us?

381
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,470
Ha-young!

382
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,178
What's happening?

383
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:46,682
She seems to be hurt bad
Don't just look at her

384
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,585
Carry her

385
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,562
- Miss, where's the nearest
- hospital?

386
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,636
- That way
- That way?

387
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,762
The hospital's that way
Hurry and go over there

388
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,205
She's heavier
than she looks

389
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,242
Hello?
Is this the Renaissance Hotel?

390
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:30,017
Okay, I'll see you soon

391
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,935
Do I really have to do this?

392
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,969
Ha-young, please help me

393
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,106
This is absolutely crazy
He thinks I'm a total lunatic

394
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,336
It's okay, he'll understand
everything later on

395
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:00,049
Why?
Is something wrong?

396
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,478
I sort of know
where he's going

397
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,516
But still

398
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,517
I feel so bad
for being this awful

399
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,528
To someone I don't know

400
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,293
Plus, I feel a bit sorry
for him

401
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,860
It's okay If it's okay with me,
it'll be okay with him

402
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,527
He'll probably be more
thankful to you later

403
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,162
Hurry and grab on
to him for me, okay?

404
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,044
I give up

405
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,538
Okay, you bad girl

406
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,222
Hello?

407
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,329
Just finish up, and come
help me at the hotel

408
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,634
I'm exhausted for running
around since this morning

409
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,375
You always catch me
at the wrong time

410
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,545
I have a very important
customer coming

411
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,445
Bye, sorry

412
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,725
- Come on, help me
- I'm Du-hyung I'll be right there

413
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,095
I'm going crazy

414
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,663
I won't make you crazy,
give me one more chance

415
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,790
No way
I've already got a boyfriend

416
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,766
You're the cutest
when you lie

417
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,336
Where are you?
I'm coming

418
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,204
- Here? Hotel
- Hotel?

419
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,711
- A love Hotel
- A love Hotel?

420
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,565
I've heard a lot
about you

421
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,628
- Have you read the contract?
- Yes

422
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,569
- Daddy!
- No way

423
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,679
You can't over
my dead body

424
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,179
- I'll kill myself!
- Go ahead

425
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,906
Better to die
than sending you to him

426
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,483
Mi-ryoung!

427
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,920
Jung-woo!

428
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,522
- Jung-woo!
- No!

429
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,550
You aborigine!

430
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,165
Get out of here!
If you don't, I'll kill you!

431
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,728
Daddy! Daddy!

432
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,338
Bastard, stop right there!
Bastard!

433
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,926
What's wrong with you?

434
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,565
It's warm here
Why?

435
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,035
Well, it's strange

436
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,877
how someone I never
met tails me all day

437
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,714
Why do you keep
doing this?

438
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,119
Want me to tell you why?

439
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,794
You knew?

440
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,961
How could I not,
since you're so obvious?

441
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,536
Someone asked you
to do this

442
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:55,371
Thought you could've
fooled me till the end?

443
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,377
Wang Ha-young

444
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,289
I don't know
what Seron said,

445
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,881
but no means no

446
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:14,030
I've already made a deal

447
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,563
with Hicore Data

448
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,928
Is that so?

449
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,913
I should've told
you earlier

450
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,088
Sorry

451
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,259
Now stop wearing
yourself out,

452
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,756
and go report this
to your company

453
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,801
Excuse me

454
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,454
Aren't you finished yet?

455
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,287
Because of you, I've broken
the worst record here

456
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,121
- How could you do this to me?
- I'm sorry

457
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,959
What happened here today,
I'll let it pass

458
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,863
But there's no
damn party, got it?

459
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,732
- Daddy
- Please give up!

460
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,063
Go home

461
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,204
And that Jung-woo
better not come

462
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,841
Also, bring a decent guy
to me instead

463
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,774
I can't give him up!
I'm already Jung-woo's woman

464
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,307
And Jung-woo
is a decent man

465
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,419
- What?
- I'm serious

466
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,419
Then you're not
my daughter

467
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:51,192
Honey, either you
have no daughter,

468
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:55,324
or you live alone
without a husband

469
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,957
Honey, how could
I live without you?

470
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,882
In-joo?

471
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,778
What? You're coming
to the hotel? Okay

472
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,188
Hey!

473
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,297
Where's Ha-young?

474
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,999
Why would a loser like you
look for Ha-young?

475
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,665
It's obvious, you idiot
She's the woman I love

476
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,368
Love my ass Move

477
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,069
Hey, hey

478
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,877
This is love not friendship
We've met for two years

479
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:49,414
What use is two years
if there was never a spark?

480
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,348
It wasn't about a spark

481
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,952
You know we were
going to ignite it, but…

482
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,614
Ignite it?

483
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,827
Hey, boy!

484
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,692
Do you ignite something
for two years?

485
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,097
A spark to go off doesn't
even take a second, dummy

486
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,769
- Let me go, okay?
- Hey! Hey!

487
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,838
- Damn it!
- You're go to see Ha-young?

488
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,970
She's going to show me
her new boyfriend, so what?

489
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,677
What?

490
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,211
Can I ask you something?

491
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,248
You have to
tell me the truth

492
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,655
Okay

493
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,299
You haven't reported
to your company yet, right?

494
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,832
That I finished
my A4type contract?

495
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,598
Right

496
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,840
Well, because it's not just
a simple matter

497
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,176
Why?

498
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:13,562
I thought this was
all about the contract

499
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:19,240
Spilling coffee on me,
and taking me to a beach

500
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,640
Honestly, it was fun

501
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,350
This never happened to me,

502
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,418
and meeting a person
like you was a first

503
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,447
But now there's no use

504
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,223
So

505
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:42,493
I can't stand when people
try to make a fool of me

506
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,606
Wait!
It's not what you think

507
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,679
It could've happened,
you know

508
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,612
Get lost, okay?

509
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,391
- Wait!
- Do you ever stop?

510
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,633
There's a reason
behind it all

511
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,398
And how could you
just walk away like that?

512
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,767
Aren't you being too cruel?

513
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,607
Then tell me why

514
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,686
Kim Jung-woo!
Think I enjoy doing this?

515
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,029
I'm going crazy, too

516
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:53,493
Think it's easy
to chase after

517
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,501
someone else's boyfriend?

518
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,369
If I could've told you,
I would've already

519
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:03,577
Why'd you have to come early
and make my life hell?

520
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,963
But she put in so much time

521
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,297
into your birthday party

522
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,502
What happens now?
I told you everything

523
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,641
Mi-ryoung is going to kill me

524
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,840
She'll never want to
see me again

525
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,989
Sounds fun

526
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,625
It wasn't fun for me
up till now

527
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:05,039
But the party tonight
will be a blast

528
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:09,409
Only if you
pretend not to know

529
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,638
I'd like to, but

530
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,908
No, you have no choice

531
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,780
You have to pretend
Okay?

532
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,031
I have to go now

533
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,503
Ha-young, wait

534
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,804
I came in a rush,
so I couldn't buy a present

535
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,607
Can you help me
pick something out?

536
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,415
Pardon?
Well, I guess so

537
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,718
Excuse me

538
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,990
What the hell?

539
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,598
What's going on?

540
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,101
What's she doing here?

541
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,740
What's going on?

542
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,917
Daddy

543
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,386
- Uh?
- You have to know

544
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:37,563
Even if I wanted to
give him up, I can't

545
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,466
- What the?
- I'm carrying his baby,

546
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,001
so how could I lose him?

547
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,734
- You what?
- I'm pregnant with his baby

548
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:51,944
What?

549
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,616
Ha-young

550
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,616
Looks good on you

551
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:05,391
Are you crazy? Why would
Ha-young be here in the day?

552
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,257
Are you that stupid
to not know why?

553
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,231
Is she here? Really?
Which room is she in?

554
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,695
They're all dead meat

555
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,596
- Why'd you hit me?
- Did it hurt?

556
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,306
Then it doesn't?

557
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,501
Well then

558
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,840
I crazy

559
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,547
I, l…

560
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:30,175
- I'll hold it for you
- You're lucky I'm in a rush

561
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:33,083
Where are they?
Where are they?

562
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,818
Isn't that Ha-young?

563
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,953
Hey!
You blind? That's not her

564
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,031
Who's that bastard?

565
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,495
Get out of here

566
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,594
What's wrong with you?

567
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,798
They're headed for a room
Wait Unbelievable!

568
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,245
Is something wrong?

569
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,311
It's nothing at all

570
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,348
So which room is yours?

571
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:13,921
Here!

572
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,440
Would you like some coffee?

573
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,371
No thanks, I'm okay

574
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,510
- This is the right place, huh?
- This is kid napping

575
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,346
She's wouldn't
come here herself

576
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,752
Sure I'd love some

577
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,585
Know, that it took me
103 days to kiss her finally?

578
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,691
Where are they, damn it?

579
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,730
Move Hey, it all depends
on who you meet

580
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,301
- Be quiet, damn it
- I'm talking about me

581
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,669
Hello?
What?

582
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,374
Really?
Okay, bye

583
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,945
The salon said I have
a regular coming in

584
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,618
Stay there for 100 days
and see if she'll show up?

585
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,018
Look where always
cheating on girls gets you

586
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:26,131
Jung-woo, what do you
like about Mi-ryoung?

587
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:38,173
Well Mi-ryoung said she
was attracted to that

588
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,377
That it was very sexy

589
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,779
When you drink something,

590
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:49,756
that your adam's apple
goes up and down

591
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,930
Yeah? What were they doing?
I'm extremely curious

592
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:01,069
Hey, she's really good
at coaxing people

593
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,137
She's got guts How could
she follow him into the hotel?

594
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,908
- What?
- She has to do what it takes

595
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,410
Even if she has to go
to the public bath with him

596
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,013
You and her aren't just
normal friends, you know

597
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,844
Wait, I forgot something
I'll call you later

598
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:21,216
Oh yeah, which hotel
and floor did you say?

599
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,058
Ha-young, what kind
of man do you like?

600
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,426
I've known Mi-ryoung since
high school freshman year

601
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:36,703
She's the nice step-sister,
and I'm the bad Cinderella

602
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,568
We're a perfect match

603
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:47,708
I guess that means
both of your tastes are similar

604
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:53,845
No! The food and clothes
we like are different

605
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,989
But our taste in guys

606
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,734
is more different
The guys I liked she hated,

607
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:12,500
and the guys she liked
I didn't like them all

608
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:17,010
- Is that so?
- Yes

609
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,205
So what about this time?

610
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:24,577
Well, not too sure But being
in love is all that matters

611
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,223
It's not important
what I think

612
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,722
It does because
we're friends

613
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,965
You know, a friend's friend
is a friend, too

614
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,069
I have to go now

615
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,376
Wait

616
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,550
Leaving already?

617
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,316
Yes

618
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,154
Are you tired?

619
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,089
Just that I woke up
so early today

620
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,695
I guess going to
the airport exhausted me

621
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:48,429
Really?
I have some drugs

622
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:53,734
I mean some good stuff,
so do you want some?

623
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,900
What is it?

624
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:01,915
I brought it from America,
and it works really well

625
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,879
Even a little
gets you really up

626
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,384
Actually,

627
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,324
I got addicted
and got some treatment

628
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,431
It's okay if it's a little

629
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:23,329
Well, no one's around
One sec

630
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,761
What kind of drug is this?

631
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,609
Know how painful it
was for me at the dentist?

632
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,173
Sure thing Then have
a lot of fun Bye!

633
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,753
Wow, your hair
looks good like that

634
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,132
Wait!

635
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,206
Here's what you
asked for

636
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,143
Wow, that was fast

637
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,045
Thank you

638
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,381
Try them on

639
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,167
I thought you were
going to repair them

640
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,733
Ever since this morning,
you went through a lot for us

641
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:19,273
Also, I feel bad for
getting mad at you

642
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,079
Anyway, thank you

643
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,288
Please, you don't have to

644
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,458
No, I'd like to take you

645
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,399
- Shall we?
- Thanks

646
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:19,767
Ha-young

647
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:28,007
Wang Ha-young freeze!

648
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,185
Who is that guy?

649
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,484
Stop right there!

650
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,631
Why are you running?

651
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,900
What do I need to run for?
I didn't do anything wrong

652
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,909
- It's because I'm sick of you
- You know you ran

653
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,242
People run when they
did something wrong

654
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:12,125
Hey

655
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,962
Is your eye an accessory?

656
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:18,999
She didn't tell you, huh?

657
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,501
She's a hairstylest,
a scissorhand

658
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:24,171
It hasn't been that long either

659
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,134
She didn't tell you, huh?

660
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:29,035
Make sure you take a good like
at her Call this a woman?

661
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,772
Is this a woman's body?

662
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,242
Take a good look

663
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,610
Both her back and front are flat
Her head's on backwards now

664
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,947
- Hey, look!
- Asshole!

665
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:45,188
I met Ha-young
when she cut my hair

666
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,323
Shit, while she cut your hair?

667
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,465
Well, now I'm gonna
break your skull

668
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,454
Wang Ha-young!

669
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,968
Where are you?

670
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:31,495
Bastards I'm sure
I saw them come in here

671
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,000
- Look here
- Pardon?

672
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,236
See a skinny girl and

673
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,836
a weird-looking guy come in?

674
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,575
- I don't think so
- Where the hell did they go?

675
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,015
- Anyway, Do I know you?
- Don't bother me, lady!

676
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,615
Where the hell are you?

677
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:50,750
You're dead if I catch you!
Damn it!

678
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,696
Everyone please have a seat

679
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,699
We'll begin very soon

680
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,225
We're trapped

681
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,293
Sorry

682
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:30,356
That bastard
What's up with him?

683
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,634
He must've mistaken you
as my new boyfriend

684
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:41,103
How did you ever meet
a guy like that?

685
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,967
This is fun

686
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:14,140
Well, I'm not upset
over what you said

687
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,043
But we must really seem
that way to him

688
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,874
Ha-young with me…

689
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:30,152
By the way,

690
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,091
if…

691
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:38,127
You weren't Mi-ryoung's
friend or I didn't know her,

692
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,732
what would've happened?

693
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,764
Pardon?

694
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,954
- Well What's this?
- Uh!

695
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,824
There's people here

696
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,896
What?

697
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:14,701
My goodness,
what are they doing there?

698
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,413
Have a nice day

699
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,382
Ha-young, stop right there!

700
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:42,258
You said you could
marry me long time ago!

701
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,034
How could you
steal someone else's girl?

702
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,598
What? Not this way

703
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,474
Wang Ha-young!

704
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,245
Ha-young

705
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,982
Well…
Did you…

706
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,749
really talk about
marriage with that guy?

707
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,579
Yes, just once

708
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,953
Last Valentine's Day
I got flowers for the first time,

709
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,625
and I was drunk
when I said it

710
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:53,234
But I took it back
first thing the next morning

711
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,584
Wow, your hand

712
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:15,313
It's ugly, huh?
The palms are worse

713
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,355
All my fingerprints are gone

714
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:21,256
Since I've always touched
chemicals at the salon

715
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,161
Not at all, they're pretty

716
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:28,096
Hands that could
be good at anything

717
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,766
We should go

718
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,629
- Hi, Mi-ryoung
- Hi

719
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,066
Where have you been?
Where's Jung-woo?

720
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:52,739
You should go now

721
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,918
Ha-young, wait
There's something…

722
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:04,049
I mean there's something
I need to tell you

723
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,659
Please, don't

724
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,619
I don't know what it is,

725
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:12,661
but it's better not to say it

726
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:23,072
Ha-young,
could you do me one favor?

727
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:36,556
Hello
Who will need a cut?

728
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:41,662
Well, you see
An empty chair would

729
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:43,825
Pardon?

730
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:10,682
You're good

731
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,996
I told you, so I told you
you'd be good at anything

732
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,329
Looks great

733
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:57,161
Mi-ryoung

734
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,034
Where's Jung-woo?

735
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:04,536
Probably on his way
to your house

736
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,500
The car's at the
Coex Mall parking lot

737
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,338
How come I couldn't
get a hold of you?

738
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:13,246
It's because
I lost my cell phone

739
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:14,639
Where?

740
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:18,114
Why?
What did I do wrong?

741
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,188
I had a really hard day
because of you

742
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:31,331
Oh, I found this
in the trunk

743
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,435
My clothes got ruined
so I had no choice

744
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,561
The clothes isn't the problem

745
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:41,306
- Then what's the problem?
- How should I know?

746
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,207
You're the one
with Jung-woo all day

747
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:46,280
Think I wanted
to be with him?

748
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:49,343
Yeah, I'm the one
who forced you into it

749
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,213
But I asked you
just to be with him

750
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:57,117
I was just with him,
like you said

751
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,185
But something's not right

752
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:05,390
- I'm something bad happened
- Nothing bad happened

753
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,431
The party will go well

754
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,363
And Jung-woo will like it

755
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,365
I'm sorry

756
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,037
I didn't want to be
suspicious of anything

757
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,743
But ln-joo said

758
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,547
you went
to Jung-woo's hotel room

759
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,784
I had no choice
because of Du-hyung

760
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:32,021
Of course Nothing happened,
right Ha-young?

761
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,494
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have

762
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,193
I see you've
bought new shoes

763
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,404
You had time for that?

764
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:53,381
- Just that my heels broke
- Did you buy them?

765
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,144
- No
- Who bought them?

766
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,930
Hello, Jung-woo?

767
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:16,864
Know, how much
I worried about you?

768
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,971
Message?
I didn't hear it

769
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:24,839
Oh, the battery was dead

770
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,413
You did? No,

771
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,483
just my family
will be there

772
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,820
I do, too
See you soon

773
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,654
He said he'll be a little late

774
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:40,488
If I stand around like this,
he might really run away

775
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,789
Do my hair
and makeup for me

776
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,024
- Me?
- Yes, you

777
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,100
Be responsible for me

778
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:53,365
I can't be responsible

779
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,379
For making you faint after
seeing how pretty you'll get

780
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,960
Isn't my Jung-woo
absolutely fantastic?

781
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,507
Not absolutely
A little…

782
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,974
If it's that much,
then isn't he great?

783
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,473
Don't over do it, honey

784
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:39,582
But it's never as much as
replacing your best friend

785
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:44,548
It's so pretty
Thank you, Ha-young

786
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,284
Jung-woo will be surprised

787
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:51,363
Better not test out Jung-woo
to see what he's like

788
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,932
Did anyone ask to?
Hurry and go

789
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:56,031
Come with me

790
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,363
No, I have to clean up first

791
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,407
Yeah? Then you better
be there by eight

792
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,207
Want some?

793
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,583
Hi, Mi-ryoung

794
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,351
Gi-chan What's this?

795
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,326
Leave it to us to surprise
Jung-woo out of his wits

796
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,361
We'll make it
an awesome time

797
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,026
Why are you still there?

798
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:31,070
If you don't come, I'll really
think something happened

799
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,107
When the hell is he coming?

800
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:41,477
Mom, better be nicer to
Jung-woo than you're to me

801
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,640
But what's taking so long?

802
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,310
He'll be here soon

803
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,291
Dad, he's on his way

804
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,094
He's here!
Turn off the lights!

805
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:50,108
How could you do this to me?

806
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:53,437
I trusted you,
so how could you?

807
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:59,046
What are you talking about?

808
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:01,314
Mi-ryoung,
let me explain

809
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:02,922
Who are you?

810
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:09,128
Well, I was the one
who was with her today

811
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:13,693
Jung-woo,

812
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,501
what's going on?

813
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,960
- Done
- Thank you

814
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,662
That was fun

815
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:47,392
Must be nice to have
someone waiting for you

816
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:51,366
That's not so I'll be busy
all day, so I'll see her at night

817
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:55,702
The color is the same as mine

818
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,611
I couldn't get mine cleaned,
so I left it at home

819
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:06,285
I'm sorry

820
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,825
How foolish of me
I'm so sorry

821
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:16,819
Weren't you
looking for someone?

822
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:22,331
Pardon?
Yeah, I found him

823
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:33,069
Mi-ryoung, it's Jung-woo
I just arrived at the hotel

824
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,507
How come I can't reach you?

825
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:41,979
Yes, Pardon?

826
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,082
Mi-ryoung's home?

827
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:48,087
But it'll take me
till eight to finish work

828
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:52,461
Okay Then have a good time
Bye

829
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,322
Hello?

830
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,264
Isn't this Wang
Ha-young's phone?

831
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,669
Pardon?

832
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:27,057
Did you know I'd give in
by you making her pregnant?

833
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,954
Pardon?

834
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:55,519
Ha-young

835
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:02,285
Are you very angry?

836
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,393
Ha-young, I'm sorry

837
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:10,002
I was going to tell you,
but the timing wasn't

838
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:14,204
I said I'm sorry

839
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:18,743
It's not like
I was doing it for fun

840
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:21,143
You see, my feelings

841
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,578
Well, if l

842
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,846
had told you,
then you'd just go, so

843
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:31,050
Hey, get lost!

844
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:34,920
I can't stand when
I'm made a fool of, too

845
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:56,613
Why are you so down?

846
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,444
It's because of that
fake Jung-woo, huh?

847
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:04,958
Anyway, yesterday was crazy
Was it too fun, maybe?

848
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:07,460
Don't laugh

849
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,790
Why? It's cute

850
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:14,094
He kept being with you
because he liked you

851
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:16,230
That's enough

852
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:19,734
Come on, don't be a tease

853
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:22,569
Keep this up,
and you'll really regret it

854
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:07,851
Ha-young, you have a customer
You're being asked for

855
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:14,917
Ha-young, I'm very sorry
You'll forgive me, right?

856
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:22,121
Ha-young, cheer up now
Let's have our own party, too

857
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,994
Blow them out

858
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:29,563
Go ahead

859
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,361
Ha-young

860
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:01,063
We're friends, right?

861
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,399
But instead of friends,
what do I need to do

862
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,869
to be your boyfriend?

863
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:12,437
It'll take quite a long time

864
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:18,109
How long?

865
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:23,048
Well, we'll have to
talk a lot and get real close

866
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,985
For about a year

867
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:27,952
A year?

868
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:34,434
I can handle that

869
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:40,899
But didn't we talk and
spend a lot of time together?

870
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:58,451
- Jung-woo I mean ln-hoo
- Yes?

871
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,627
What if

872
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,089
What if?

873
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:07,832
What if l…

874
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:11,995
hadn't mistaken you for
my friend's boyfriend?

875
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,674
Then I wouldn't
have met you

876
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:27,448
What if you were really

877
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,080
my friend's boyfriend?

878
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:35,328
That's what happened
yesterday

879
01:35:35,796 --> 01:35:38,390
Although in the end it wasn't

880
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,999
Things don't seem to go

881
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,668
the way people really want

882
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,364
You're right

883
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:51,005
From now on, I won't leave
my boyfriend with a friend

884
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,703
- Never! No way!
- Me, too

885
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:56,212
To entrust or be entrusted

886
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,882
- Ha-young, thank you so much
- For what?

887
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:04,922
I came to Korea quite often,

888
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:07,789
and no one came
to see me at the airport
