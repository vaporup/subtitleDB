00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:04,506
Dr. Wai In The Scripture With No Words

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,035
I'm an adventure story writer.
My father was an adventurer…

3
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:21,915
Fortunately, he kept an amazing journal

4
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,771
He was known far and wide as:

5
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,713
"The Adventure King"

6
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:38,395
- Hey, stop them!
- What!?

7
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:39,988
- Where is Dr. Lu?
- Inside of the Ox.

8
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,546
And indeed he is inside the ox.

9
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,691
Oh wait, don't get me wrong.
This young is not my father.

10
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:55,867
- He's my father’s student, Pao Sam-Chao.
- Dr. Lu, get out of there.

11
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:59,132
Why are you yelling?
You should not disturb a mad scientist at work!

12
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:02,972
- Master said no one should touch this before he gets here.
- Your master is a fool!

13
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:04,732
This ancient relic is
a fantastic find.

14
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:06,804
We can't leave it here,
someone might steal it.

15
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:10,417
- Get out!
- No way!

16
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,679
See?
I knew something would happen.

17
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,564
And here he comes, my father Dr.Wai.

18
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:44,348
Take a good look at him,
how handsome he is.

19
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,722
How dashing!

20
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:50,746
- Master!
- He looks straight out of Hollywood.

21
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:57,688
Master, come quickly.
It's a Disaster!

22
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:05,275
Time for dad to do his stuff,
He is my hero.

23
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:08,090
If I had his courage,
my life would be perfect.

24
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,528
Thank you everyone for your help.

25
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:58,459
Adventure King, you'll die for this!
You ruined this ancient Ox!

26
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,859
If I'm gonna die, you're gonna die first.

27
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:03,128
Why are you all holding rocks?

28
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,299
Adventure King Sir,
an urgent message.

29
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:21,528
It's from general Lone.
You must fly to Xian immediately.

30
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,491
First class! Take me with you sir!

31
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,219
I always wanted to meet the general.

32
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,528
Good, then come.

33
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,607
Master,
who is this General Lone?

34
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,143
He is the head of
the secret agents.

35
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:37,631
Just listen and don't talk.

36
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,115
General...

37
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,929
Thank you for the invitation,
what can I do for you?

38
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:49,160
Right, let’s get to the point.
You're an archeologist

39
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,744
and an expert in finding ancient valuable relics.

40
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:57,671
Adventure King, find the scripture with no words
complete with its box.

41
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:00,453
Adventure King, you must not refuse me.

42
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:06,343
- What kind of scripture? Can my master help?
- The whereabouts of the scripture is a mystery.

43
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:08,104
The only thing heard about it...

44
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:11,271
is that it was last seen late in Ming dynasty.

45
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:15,399
The leader of the sultan Tuen Ming knew
that some Tibetan Llamas had it.

46
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,215
So he put together a gang of his own
to attack these Llamas...

47
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:20,999
His plan was to steal the
scripture and its box.

48
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:25,767
They met in the desert and had a
terrible battle... The legend has it

49
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:29,480
that the desert sand turned
bloody red for square miles.

50
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,615
- Give me the scripture, or die now!
- You'll never get the scripture from me...

51
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:34,786
- If you open the box, it your peril.
- Fine.

52
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:49,733
The box is over there.

53
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,915
Do not look inside.

54
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:17,671
No one emerged from that battle alive,
people who found

55
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:21,223
the bodies later, says the place is haunted,
but refused to say another word.

56
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:25,031
Except that General Tuen Ming
turned into a ghost...

57
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:27,300
and to stole the scripture,
then disappeared.

58
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:32,584
Brilliant, I'm sure I found
the right guy for the job!

59
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,078
I haven't agreed to do it.

60
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,047
The future of the Humanity
depends on this scripture.

61
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:42,119
Who to possesses it will have the future
of the world in their hands.

62
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,574
Finding the Box,
will lead to the scripture.

63
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,251
You cannot refuse.

64
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:51,814
All right, where do we begin?

65
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,887
All the information we have,
is in a letter

66
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,711
it's from a team of archeologists.

67
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:59,623
The letter is with the Japanese
ambassador, in Shang-Hai.

68
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:01,223
Excellent one, we will go at once.

69
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,111
Find me through the 7th heaven night club.

70
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:06,853
It's owned by my buddy Chu Fat Pai,
he'll be around.

71
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:15,908
Shanghai, Paris of the east.
Where my father’s adventures started.

72
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:34,852
- Tell Ting Ling to avenge me.
- Who's he? Probably to busy.

73
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:38,855
Master that wasn't very sympathetic.

74
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,295
Look, we're here on business...

75
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,051
and don't have time for every
bleeding heart story.

76
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:46,844
Dr. Wai, my boss
is waiting for you. Come in.

77
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,583
I'll get cold fatty!

78
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,047
Mr. Chung,
long time, no see!

79
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,502
Adventure King,
you got a nerve!

80
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:15,047
You staid away for far too long.
You come to see me at last.

81
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:17,055
All right boys, forget the guns.

82
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:22,055
Come, sit down and have some fun.

83
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:28,318
- So friend, you're here to tell me something?
- You’re gonna love it.

84
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:34,142
- Need to sneak into the Japanese Embassy.
- But that will be no fun at all.

85
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,999
But it’s necessary to steal something.

86
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:41,057
- A confidential letter
- That's more like it, cheers!

87
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:49,131
I feel an idiot.

88
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,883
Mr. Chun, are you sure about this?

89
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,014
Don't you trust me?
Follow me!

90
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:02,763
Why do women dress like this?

91
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:08,459
- To attract the men.
- I prefer my women naked.

92
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:18,727
Gentleman and Mrs. Chan,
of the Bank of Wing.

93
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:22,891
- Mr. Chun, of the 7th Heaven.
- My first wife...

94
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:26,633
The others are concubines.
Lucky me!

95
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:32,235
See what it takes, the sacrifices
an adventurer has to make?

96
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:35,179
My father would do any thing
to discover the truth.

97
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,146
Sometimes it was a real drag...

98
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:47,211
- So much to eat! Mustn’t get fat.
- Miss, may I have this dance?

99
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,803
- I do not know how to dance.
- And I am married.

100
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,942
Don't worry about it.

101
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,766
More drinks!

102
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,387
It's too bright
to make the robbery.

103
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:10,980
What did you say?

104
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:17,963
Where is the main switch, General?

105
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:20,810
That's easy,
in the main switch room.

106
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,522
Nobody deceives you, right?

107
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:30,052
Keep and eye on him.

108
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,171
- Oh dear, our poor husband.
- Is he all right?

109
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,953
He is so drunk, let's take him home.

110
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,379
My wife does not understand me.

111
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,841
General, he is drunk.

112
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:49,857
Follow him.

113
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:54,852
I'm not sure this plan is so great.

114
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,541
Dump him, dear.

115
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,672
Kill the lights.

116
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,997
- Oh my!
- Crowded with guards.

117
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,812
This is hot.
Things need to cool down.

118
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,612
Just a minute.

119
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,323
You're coming apart.

120
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:38,292
There.

121
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,641
Let me do it.

122
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:51,927
- Thank you
- Japanese Girls know...

123
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:53,869
how to make a man feel great.

124
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,687
- We did a good job!
- Shut up.

125
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,337
- Is this is part of the dance?
- I don't know.

126
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,268
- This must be it.
- Get rid of these clothes.

127
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:23,440
- Let's find the safe.
- Right.

128
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,748
I'll search this side.

129
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:29,779
Master, I think I found it.

130
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,523
What are you doing?

131
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,948
Now we're in trouble.

132
00:13:58,455 --> 00:13:59,469
What’s this?

133
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,122
Confidential.

134
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,410
To Miss Kwan Siu Wan.

135
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:20,816
Who is there?

136
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,716
It's you!
I beg you’re pardon.

137
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:39,057
I went to the wrong bathroom, I just came
out and there you were, we meet again.

138
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:43,667
But... you were a woman then.

139
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:48,052
Not really, just pretended to be a woman.
Sometimes, I'm man.

140
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,711
You're disguised as woman?

141
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,654
I am a woman, it's not a disguise.

142
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:58,095
I can see that.
You are very attractive.

143
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:01,620
- You're a very attractive guy.
- You, mean that?

144
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,890
Scouts honor.

145
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,163
We didn't find anything.

146
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,643
Keep on alert.

147
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:13,873
You never saw me.

148
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:17,616
I can hear a voice.

149
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:19,959
Come out!

150
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,966
Hi, want me?

151
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,046
Round one to me.

152
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,310
Take him!

153
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,830
Are you all right?

154
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,527
Never felt better.

155
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,113
My stomach aches
and I'm loosing.

156
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,829
No, not again!

157
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,655
Take this!

158
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,190
No closer!

159
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:43,468
If I move,
the pen will set his gun off.

160
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,714
Put the guns down!

161
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:49,939
Here it is my autograph!

162
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,498
Must be "Adventure King"

163
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,863
The Adventure King

164
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,139
Don’t let him run away.

165
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,850
- Gee, stay over.
- Another time.

166
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:22,485
- Are you crazy, you almost killed me.
- I'm sorry, general.

167
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:25,202
Don't hang about.
Look for the letter.

168
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,062
Master, too many soldiers.

169
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:33,713
- Safe, under the nose of the enemy.
- Go in, go on.

170
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:38,934
- Where are you going?
- Under the enemy's nose.

171
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,302
- Who said that?
- You did.

172
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:44,717
- Wait here!
- Master, sometimes I don't understand.

173
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:53,623
Don't go anywhere, let's talk all right?

174
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,895
OK, you were right.
I was inside...

175
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:58,797
But then I came out over there.
But now I'm over here again.

176
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,967
And that's how I run into you guys.
It must be our destiny?

177
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,007
Well, if it’s faded,
better go along with it.

178
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:09,046
Why do you guys take your duty so seriously?

179
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,704
It's just salary staff.

180
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,519
- Why am I back here?
- Miss, wait a minute.

181
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,526
Rats!
I can't let him see me looking like this.

182
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:25,236
- Miss, isn’t you the woman I just spoke to?
- What are you dong here?

183
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,533
Is it you?

184
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:30,931
It's so dark.

185
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,930
Miss, are you sleepwalking?

186
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,231
Noble approach to water beds.

187
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:44,951
What are you doing here?
I am taking bath.

188
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,155
Oh gee, I just saw everything!

189
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,293
Must be a secret code.

190
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:05,168
In... deep waters...
What is going on?

191
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,174
Be a gentleman,
don't do anything you'll regret.

192
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:12,208
Turn of the light.
This is hard!

193
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:16,214
- C'mon I like to see you.
- Got a headache?

194
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:17,524
I got some whit flower oil.

195
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:20,790
Oh, dear!
It's all gone wet.

196
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,374
It doesn't matter,
faster penetration.

197
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:26,870
Give me some.

198
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,259
A massage?
I can't.

199
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:33,585
- Sure you can.
- I am very shy.

200
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:38,166
- What is it?
- You’re wet, dry yourself up...

201
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,079
or you'll look like a drowned
chicken with wet feathers.

202
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,079
- Hey, I was born in the year of the chicken!
- And was in the year of the rabbit.

203
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,283
Turn of that light.
Let the chicken and bunny have a bath.

204
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:50,798
First, tell me who you are.

205
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:55,799
Careful, father, can be a trap.

206
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,075
I am the actor Jet LI.

207
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,887
You should never tell lies
with the light on.

208
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:02,316
Look, its out!

209
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,702
I don't want much out of life.
Just to be the King everywhere on the planet...

210
00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:11,412
and have thousands
of loving wives.

211
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,166
What's this?

212
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,438
Master, help me.

213
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:18,380
Piece of cake.

214
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:21,357
Fetch!

215
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,486
How come the obey you?
They you're relatives?

216
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:29,104
- Go and ask him.
- I'm not that stupid.

217
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,060
- There you go, all you do is play?
- I was tricked.
- Serves you right!

218
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:46,032
Wait for me Master, I'm exhausted.

219
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:54,835
I read the letter. It does not say anything.
It doesn’t refer to the Box.

220
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:59,984
As I imagined. But somewhere in
the letter is a way to find Ming.

221
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:03,949
- You're great.
- Speak up

222
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,151
The one who wrote this probably
failed language class, it's chicken script.

223
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,134
- Ignorant pig!
- Go on

224
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:12,022
He wanted to get a divorce from his wife,

225
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,486
but didn't mention anything
about alimony.

226
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:16,723
- Go on.
- Listen to this.

227
00:21:18,455 --> 00:21:21,206
Jesus!
In fact he was happily married...

228
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:24,758
but the obsession of the Box
destroyed his marriage.

229
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:28,200
That idiot!
Giving up the wife for a box.

230
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,000
You better than that?

231
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:33,093
I don't want the Box,
give me a woman.

232
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,593
Women are more fun than boxes.

233
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,626
And more trouble.

234
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:39,613
Ah, you know?

235
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:42,149
- Any other clues?
- Like what?

236
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,715
Try looking at this newspaper.
Read it carefully.

237
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,863
- You got a map?
- Sure.

238
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:54,580
What's it for?

239
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,959
The news office, moron!

240
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:00,905
- There are so many in Shang-Hai.
- We will visit one at a time.

241
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:03,694
They have the letter,
if we're not careful,

242
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:04,839
we'll be in trouble.

243
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,557
What trouble?

244
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:13,454
You had the letter a long time
and did not discover anything.

245
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:17,998
- Nothing yet, but I...
- Adventure King is exceptional.

246
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:22,275
And I set out to trap him.
I want him to find the Box for us.

247
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:27,368
If we tail him to tight,
he will immediately suspect us.

248
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,782
If he gets any bright ideas,
he will inform the Chinese government.

249
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:34,571
That's when we'll move in.

250
00:22:37,678 --> 00:22:40,046
In the following day,
dad ordered Pao Chao...

251
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:42,414
to show the letter
to all the press offices.

252
00:22:42,414 --> 00:22:44,270
Everybody got on his case.

253
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,383
But he found a place...

254
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:50,142
Is this it?

255
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:54,412
Really difficult to find, look at it.

256
00:22:55,534 --> 00:23:00,487
Hurry up sir, pay and go.
The money, please, Come on!

257
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,430
This is only press office
that uses this lousy quality paper.

258
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,542
Come on.

259
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,485
Close this stinking old rag!

260
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,990
- It is catching fire.
- WOW, they're really organized!

261
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,255
- Keep quiet, let’s go in.
- Just showing appreciation.

262
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:25,964
- They thought you were mocking them.
- You're prejudice against me, based on pride.

263
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,830
Monday’s newspaper was
Tuesdays table cloth.

264
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,838
Tuesday’s newspaper,
Wednesdays wrapping paper.

265
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:36,334
Do not give up, tomorrow will publish again!

266
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:38,309
How dare you publish this garbage?

267
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:43,498
- We live in a free world.
- Get out of here!

268
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,718
Today’s newspaper will be
used for wrapping old knives.

269
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,566
This will demonstrate our force.

270
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,820
- Honesty and Freedom!
- Freedom!

271
00:23:58,094 --> 00:23:59,916
Be quiet.

272
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:05,006
- Who are they?
- We're looking to discover.

273
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:07,046
We're looking for part time work sir.

274
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,147
Very well!

275
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:19,821
What are you holding?

276
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,549
Oh goddess, I'm in love.

277
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:41,189
Why on earth would you work here?

278
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:46,126
I believe in honesty, freedom
and I want to work in a team!

279
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:47,239
Hogwash!

280
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:49,773
You saw through it?

281
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,446
Have no work for you, go.

282
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:57,261
- We do not want money.
- Come on, we'll try later.

283
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,311
- Are you the manager?
- Yes I am?

284
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:06,126
Every day you publish lies
about the Japanese.

285
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:08,110
Have you got a personal vendetta?

286
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,102
No, my father killed Japanese,
I can see why you're angry.

287
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:14,117
You cretin!

288
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:17,966
We'll stay here.

289
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,622
You bastards!

290
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:23,492
I'm sorry.

291
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,238
Game over.

292
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:29,416
Burn the entire office.

293
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:32,297
I'll see you again.

294
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:34,830
I'll see you again.

295
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,494
Every time you see a pretty girl...

296
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:40,302
- ...you melt to pieces.
- They are the hormones.

297
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,603
You sure?
I think it's in your head.

298
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:46,955
- I'll cover it then, so you can't see...
- That hope.

299
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,664
It is a great way to make a living
threatening people.

300
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,414
You bunch of no-goods.
Fight me if you dare.

301
00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:57,349
How dare you talk to us like that?
Get her.

302
00:26:02,414 --> 00:26:03,822
This will cost us.

303
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:06,669
You’re not kidding?
It will break us.

304
00:26:09,294 --> 00:26:13,230
Hold it, cowards!
Picking on a defenseless female like this.

305
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,408
Forget it.

306
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:22,915
Think about it,
they're not so smart.

307
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,532
Fight me if you got the guts.

308
00:26:28,846 --> 00:26:30,253
He'll never learn.

309
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Make way.

310
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:43,749
He fights well.

311
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:50,983
Your money.

312
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,037
- Want more?
- No, let’s go.

313
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,619
Stop youngsters.

314
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:13,006
Scumbags, never try to burn my office again!

315
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,500
Hey miss, wait!

316
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,039
How about thank you?

317
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,950
So we just going to stare are we?

318
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,412
No chance.

319
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:36,260
Thus you do not go.
We have to.

320
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:40,524
You want to be guards?

321
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:48,684
- They seem weird.
- No weirder than us.

322
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,518
I am an idiot.
The master always deceives me.

323
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:54,762
I do not know what to do.

324
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:58,312
Anyone here?

325
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:01,326
Nobody?

326
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:09,478
Meet guy!

327
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:14,214
Get to work!

328
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:18,156
Who is that?
They are using garbage can on the head!

329
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:23,174
- What is it?
- Very strange thing.

330
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:26,029
- Very strange?
- Yes.

331
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:45,325
Strike generate in France.
The strike you generate cause chaos...

332
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:47,694
in the public transport
and affects some sectors...

333
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:51,278
of the population are affected...

334
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,862
business is good, sales grew 50%

335
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,934
The agriculture suffers
and the crops were affected.

336
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:00,206
The strikers are not weakening...

337
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,678
and the perspectives are bad.

338
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:04,429
Some people use the advantage to gain money.

339
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:06,022
Master, let me help you.

340
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:15,374
About time. I thought that you were imitating
those French strikers.

341
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:16,584
Point taken.

342
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:22,542
Master need not worry about me, I won't strike.
But I do not know...

343
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:26,638
how the other will react.
You better take care.

344
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:29,230
I know. Therefore I dressed me
as my departed father.

345
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,701
So they'll think I'm a ghost
and they'll work harder.

346
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:35,241
Do you really think this disguise
is gonna change anything?

347
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:38,958
Mysterious Appearances
inspires the staff to work harder.

348
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:42,573
The only mysterious thing
is in your head.

349
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,262
Not so.
Those two new faces are mysterious.

350
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:48,398
Use expensive clothes and
had come for specific reasons.

351
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:50,437
Best to keep them here,
where we can watch them.

352
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:54,318
You're probably right,
do you think they are looking for that box?

353
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:58,702
She's not only beautiful, but also intelligent.
I love that in a woman!

354
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:02,222
Stop that disgusting talk, its horrible.

355
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:03,758
What is inside of the Box, anyway?

356
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:07,118
Have never opened it. My father opened it and
he transformed into subspecies.

357
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:10,053
All I know it's powerful
and it never must be opened.

358
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:16,685
When we find it, we'll better take care.

359
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:20,078
Not to worry.
It is very well hidden.

360
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:22,062
It's hidden in a secret room
behind the printing machine.

361
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:26,125
Nobody knows how to get in there,
only your incredible master knows...

362
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,460
Don't worry about anyone finding it.

363
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:33,101
Master, you’re on only handsome
but also incredible smart.

364
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:36,298
I love an intelligent man,
it's such a turn on!

365
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,578
The shelf!

366
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,013
Quickly!

367
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,218
Luckily the box is fine.

368
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:00,007
A dog!

369
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,237
A snake!

370
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,190
The dog is strong as a bull.

371
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,564
The snake is stronger!

372
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,314
That strange noise!

373
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:13,710
- Let's go!
- My foot is stuck.

374
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,499
- Let's hurry
- It is stepping on my foot.

375
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:27,530
A giant large rat!

376
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:44,837
Right, let’s tell General Lone.

377
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:46,884
Come on!

378
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,262
See? I didn't lie to you.

379
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,702
That box can turn you into anything.

380
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,302
Or it can make you disappear.

381
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:53,645
No doubt about that.

382
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,821
Master, aren't you worried
if somebody finds out about this.

383
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:58,571
Of course not.
They may look, but they won't find it.

384
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,740
- What are you up to?
- To order a telegram.

385
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:10,406
Miss Yu Fung!

386
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:13,446
Miss Yu Fung!
Wait for me.

387
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:16,485
You?
The Japanese embassy is looking for you.

388
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:19,973
- If you don't tell, he'll never know.
- Don't worry, I won't say anything.

389
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:24,064
- Are you on a job at the moment?
- I got a new job.

390
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:42,877
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine, thanks.

391
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:46,911
- My sandal.
- I'll get it.

392
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,332
Here.

393
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,150
Thank you.

394
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,092
My pleasure.
Anything more you'd like?

395
00:32:58,373 --> 00:32:59,388
You sure?

396
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:02,112
Good bye.

397
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,222
- What is it?
- I'm worried I won't see you again.

398
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:13,051
- I must see you again!
- Whenever you want.

399
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,364
I am free every day.
Just give me a call, and I'll come over.

400
00:33:19,493 --> 00:33:20,475
Really?

401
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,427
I need to go.

402
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:29,216
- When will I see you again?
- I'll call you.

403
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:48,005
How about that, he really believed
I was born in the year of the rabbit.

404
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,462
Dad strikes again.

405
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:55,423
He made a rabbit from a linen handkerchief.
And won the lady's heart.

406
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,436
Dad, remember where you are!

407
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:07,522
I did it!

408
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,852
Quiet!
Shut up!

409
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:38,365
You come here.
Now!

410
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:43,077
I do not want to be a guinea pig.
Help!

411
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:44,354
Get in there.

412
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,871
I heard you're the strongest guru
in the world, Master Kar Tam.

413
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:59,228
I'm interested to see if you can withstand
the poisonous gases in my experiment room.

414
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:03,170
Let me out.

415
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,410
It works.

416
00:35:11,046 --> 00:35:13,501
Disgusting one! Get him out of here.

417
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,125
You will have the honor to test
our experiment.

418
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:23,237
Why do you not thank the general?

419
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:25,765
What a lot of bull, I'm not impressed.

420
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:27,707
Filthy little goblin.
Get in here.

421
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:52,607
How dare you disobey!
You could die for this.

422
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:59,302
Guru Kar Tam, this will not happen again.

423
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:00,710
I promise.

424
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,368
- Take him to his room.
- Yes.

425
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:06,245
Fascinated by murders?

426
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:07,806
He's only a silly old monk.

427
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:10,081
And a human being.

428
00:36:11,078 --> 00:36:12,517
Japanese had come to China...

429
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,721
to create the great economic
market of the Asian East.

430
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:19,206
This attitude
does not benefit anybody.

431
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:20,678
I believe the intent was...

432
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,565
Will it kill you to be quiet?

433
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:25,029
Any more interruptions and you go to a cell.

434
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:28,165
- Please no, I just...
- I'm giving you a little mission.

435
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:29,539
What?

436
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,134
Dr. Wai found the scripture box...

437
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:34,054
in righteous news daily office.

438
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:36,956
He told General Lone,
who will now come to Shanghai.

439
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:42,277
- And what has that to do with me?
- Bring Sicko Sam.

440
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:46,278
- He and his gangsters are notorious lowdown scum.
- We'll tell the gangsters to steal the Box...

441
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:49,893
then take it and they'll handle all the killing.
What a clever plan.

442
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:53,158
- That guru was so accurate.
- On what!?

443
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:54,565
That you're full of bull.

444
00:36:57,221 --> 00:36:58,912
Thank you for the kind words.

445
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,557
That stench.

446
00:37:30,694 --> 00:37:35,166
Why are you so late?
Got the relics? Hand them over!

447
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:53,601
And the red jade?

448
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:08,101
Damn!

449
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,377
Not a wise move.

450
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,949
Here it is its jade of blood.
Now, the money.

451
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:24,572
I'll pay up...

452
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:30,022
- I have more jobs for you.
- And what is it?

453
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:32,101
A simple job.

454
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,174
Go to the righteous daily news,
and bring me a box.

455
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:38,662
- And what's in this box?
- Mind your own business.

456
00:38:38,662 --> 00:38:42,306
Bring us this box
and your dreams will come true.

457
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:55,942
It is time to leave.
Go get your luggage.

458
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,600
No problem, I'm ready.

459
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:03,330
Where you going?
Somebody is waiting for you.

460
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,653
- Master, what is it?
- Check it.

461
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,148
Master, we are surrounded.

462
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:22,501
Looks like we won't get
the last edition out today.

463
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:25,189
Pansy, our luck is finished.

464
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:26,469
Master!

465
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:28,678
What's important is the box.

466
00:39:28,678 --> 00:39:30,750
Guard it with your life.
I'll hide.

467
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:33,637
Hold it.

468
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:42,117
Heroic one, it isn't a good time
to leave the building with anything valuable.

469
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:44,101
You could be in trouble.

470
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:47,941
Take care,
if those guys get it away from you...

471
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:49,348
you couldn’t begin to stop them.

472
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:55,487
True, so I decided to give this to you.
Take care of it for me.

473
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:03,205
I'm so embarrassed.

474
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:04,485
You're trying to trick those gangsters,

475
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,374
but those guys are no fools.

476
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:08,316
They will not be deceived so easily.

477
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:14,469
Master, they cut the electricity.

478
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,869
They're gonna storm in.
You get out, I'll handle it.

479
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:17,829
That won't work.

480
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:20,549
There's a whole gang outside.
Can you fight them all?

481
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:24,193
Let's divert their attention.
They are only interested in this.

482
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:28,581
We do it like this, we all leave
with box in our hands.

483
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:31,363
When we get out,
we run in different directions.

484
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:37,797
You're the only one
that knows where the box is, be careful.

485
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:41,125
I'm sorry, I misread you...
You're one of us!

486
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:44,741
That is not important, is it?
Time is running out, let’s go.

487
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:45,886
Let's go.

488
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:53,861
Hey, I know you'd like a mature boyfriend...

489
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:57,093
- But he already got a girlfriend.
- That doesn’t matter.

490
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:58,597
I don't care if you're both gay.

491
00:40:58,597 --> 00:41:00,549
You're hot tempered!

492
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:01,923
No time to talk.

493
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:09,861
Let's get this clear, I'm a single
man and I are interested in you.

494
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:11,558
I'm calling you, right?

495
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:13,892
- Right
- Kissing time.

496
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:19,109
Enough.
You are nearly history.

497
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,018
Are you ready?
Let's go!

498
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:26,269
Hang on a sec.

499
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:29,188
I must say something.

500
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:32,411
You know what I mean, don't you?

501
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:43,201
I can read your mind.
And you're a nice girl.

502
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,278
And you are thick as cow tongue.

503
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:53,605
That's fine, I can handle that.

504
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:55,460
Flowers grow beautiful in Kao Dun.

505
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:03,072
Kill everyone in the press office,
then search.

506
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:31,102
Here's the box.

507
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:37,755
Here's the box.

508
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,675
This way master.

509
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:57,349
Let's take a rest.
No one is chasing us.

510
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:58,949
We got lucky.

511
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,323
- Oh yeah?
- Who is there?

512
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:08,389
No one is chasing,
but someone is waiting.

513
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:11,877
- Give us the box tough kitten.
- Dream on.

514
00:43:11,877 --> 00:43:14,365
Pansy, don't do it.
You're no match for him.

515
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:19,870
Don’t kill her.

516
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:29,605
I gave you what you wanted,
now give the Box to me.

517
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:32,965
As my friend saved,
I'll tell you the truth...

518
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:34,757
The Box is dangerous
and will kill you.

519
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,251
So why hasn't it killed you.

520
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:49,188
Now, let's se how much
of this you can take!

521
00:43:55,621 --> 00:43:56,897
You'll die for this.

522
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,821
- Who are you?
- I am your conscience...

523
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:49,157
and I came here to say
that you must stop to killing all the time.

524
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:52,709
Give it up, find another job.
This is not good for your karma.

525
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:54,853
If you're not careful, in your next life...

526
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:56,675
you'll come back as a punch bag.

527
00:45:06,853 --> 00:45:08,837
No chance! This is for
your father, your mother...

528
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:10,876
your sister
and all your family.

529
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:13,917
Even with a gun you're hopeless.

530
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,434
Change profession, friend.

531
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:39,682
- Hey, Sicko, satisfied yet?
- Got more of those pens handy?

532
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:43,162
I have.
You want an autograph?

533
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:54,723
No way out, doctor.

534
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,220
So go.

535
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:14,817
Well, hi there.

536
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:20,101
You were great. Even without a
trash bin, you were able to defeat that jerk.

537
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:21,311
You are a real hero.

538
00:46:22,341 --> 00:46:27,076
My powers are yours. Passed on to you today
along with my students. Where is she?

539
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:30,628
Pansy!

540
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:32,894
Oh, my love.

541
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:36,860
I do not want to live
without you, Pansy!

542
00:46:38,053 --> 00:46:39,963
Pansy! You are alive.

543
00:46:41,348 --> 00:46:43,653
You broke my wrist.

544
00:46:43,653 --> 00:46:44,601
Really?

545
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,983
Sorry.

546
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:04,360
Know what, you won't be
able to look after it.

547
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,215
You better give it to the government.

548
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,465
Hey, Trashcan.
You saved our lives you know.

549
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:13,833
Take that thing off, and talk to us.

550
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,913
Don’t shout like that, why so angry?

551
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:18,248
If I was him, I would stay in that trashcan.

552
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,998
You loudmouth bitch, I'll teach you!

553
00:47:22,537 --> 00:47:25,799
Listen, you don't want the Box
taken by gangsters?

554
00:47:27,048 --> 00:47:28,617
Hmm you have a point there.

555
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:33,289
He does. Tell me where the
box is, I'll look after it?

556
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:35,817
I haven't thought of
getting rid of it.

557
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:39,849
I've decided that you will be
employed as my body guards from now on.

558
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:41,257
- Trashcan, I...
- Listen...

559
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:42,697
I get to call the shots around here, not you.

560
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:44,520
Sobbing again.

561
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,673
Let's go.

562
00:47:45,673 --> 00:47:47,337
Don't walk off, while I'm talking to you.

563
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:49,609
Calm down.
No need to push it.

564
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,656
General Lone arrives tomorrow,
he'll decide.

565
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:54,024
If I was 20 years younger,
I would teach...

566
00:47:54,024 --> 00:47:55,336
those two a lesson.

567
00:47:55,336 --> 00:47:58,020
- Let's go for a drink?
- Good idea.

568
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:00,839
Let's go for a drink.

569
00:48:02,601 --> 00:48:04,456
Aw... more drinking...

570
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:16,318
Sam, General arrives today.
Let's kill him at the station.

571
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:25,537
Master, look!

572
00:48:26,857 --> 00:48:30,056
We'll use the gas.
Tell the guys to prepare it.

573
00:48:30,056 --> 00:48:32,713
Too risky.
This place is full of innocent people.

574
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:33,736
I will do it.

575
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:36,489
General, this could
call for the ultimate sacrifice.

576
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:37,928
Don't state the obvious.

577
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:38,943
Follow me.

578
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:52,936
- Soldier, it's gas time.
- But the general is...

579
00:48:52,936 --> 00:48:55,391
Relax; she can take care of herself.

580
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:10,568
Trouble!

581
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:19,080
The gas.

582
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:22,821
What is this, I said not to use the gas.

583
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:36,391
General Lone!

584
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:42,367
Yu Fung!

585
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,694
Someone got the general.

586
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:56,384
Get after them.

587
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:08,009
Stop that train!

588
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:09,864
- Faster.
- You drive it.

589
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,625
Tell Pansy not to worry, I'm all right.

590
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:16,552
Now

591
00:50:17,545 --> 00:50:19,138
I am a love
when they treat me well.

592
00:50:20,712 --> 00:50:22,174
Don’t let the train pass.

593
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:28,898
No, no.

594
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:45,416
This is not beautiful, I'm inexperienced.
Can you drive?

595
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,100
I can hardly stand,
forget driving.

596
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:53,064
Out of the way!

597
00:50:54,537 --> 00:50:56,958
A pilot what's needed, I'll better invent it.

598
00:51:08,968 --> 00:51:11,870
Am I dreaming?

599
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:17,417
You better get off.
I am dying.

600
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:19,657
I got you on this train and I'll get you off it.

601
00:51:19,657 --> 00:51:21,348
I'm a responsible man, honey.

602
00:51:22,985 --> 00:51:24,676
Difficulties do not scare me.

603
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:28,929
Yu Fung, hang in there.

604
00:51:30,024 --> 00:51:33,636
You're strong and courageous,
nobody treated me like this before.

605
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:36,291
I'll treat you like this forever.

606
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:41,566
Yes, Adventure King,
now I can die.

607
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:53,479
Yu Fung, Yu Fung!

608
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,529
- Do these things work?
- Of course, it sucks off the poison.

609
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,239
Doctor, you know where Pao is?

610
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,766
The Japanese captured him.

611
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,076
That's terrible.

612
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:23,597
I'll get him out, relax.

613
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:28,272
I want to say something privately.

614
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,894
Sorry, can you leave?

615
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:39,308
Hey, doctor...

616
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,861
My intuition says that
she is not was she seems.

617
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,828
I think she's fine.

618
00:52:56,984 --> 00:53:00,632
The truth is that I am
a Japanese spy.

619
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:05,389
And I've been betrayed by my country men
they released the poison gas when I said no.

620
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:10,039
You better go and rescue Pao
before they use him ...

621
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,863
for an evil experiment.

622
00:53:11,863 --> 00:53:13,172
What is the address?

623
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,595
76 Lu Bo Road.

624
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:22,487
They’re bunch idiots,
won't even tell us where we are.

625
00:53:22,487 --> 00:53:27,096
That fool knows nothing.
No point of keeping him here, a waste of rice.

626
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:29,943
- All right, kill him.
- My thought exactly.

627
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:35,703
No pest control please.

628
00:53:35,703 --> 00:53:38,807
What is this?
It's horrible.

629
00:53:38,807 --> 00:53:41,431
Young fellow, save your breath,
that is poisonous gas.

630
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:43,543
Do not breathe for one hour
and you'll be all right.

631
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:47,095
- Stop breathing?
- Can you...

632
00:53:47,095 --> 00:53:48,077
I can not!

633
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:54,066
No time for jokes.
He's not moving, help.

634
00:54:14,871 --> 00:54:16,016
Quick, come on.

635
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:41,488
Welcome.

636
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:49,424
Is that the best you have to offer us?

637
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,080
One shot and you are dead.

638
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:55,154
It’s not loaded.

639
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,283
You got lucky today.

640
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:29,015
The dumply brothers.

641
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:30,706
You can not see me.

642
00:57:53,463 --> 00:57:58,733
Fantastic, master.
How did you do that?

643
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:03,511
It's all Tai-Chi, energy here,
energy there...

644
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:05,239
The energy increases...

645
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:09,431
and it concentrates to face the enemy.
Understood?

646
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:11,536
- Try again.
- No, let's eat.

647
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:14,000
Good idea.

648
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:31,606
Master...

649
00:58:32,696 --> 00:58:35,084
Pansy and the others have disappeared.

650
00:58:36,536 --> 00:58:37,746
Must have gone to get the Box.

651
00:58:38,743 --> 00:58:41,495
But where?
Shang-Hai is so big...

652
00:58:41,495 --> 00:58:44,593
and the very small Box
is easy to hide.

653
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:50,291
The press office.
They're all so weird in there.

654
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:53,262
The Box is very small...
Where could it be?

655
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,557
- I asked you that.
- You know?

656
00:58:57,623 --> 00:58:59,319
- I do not know.
- So get the car.

657
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:00,279
Immediately.

658
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:02,423
You need to be smart.

659
00:59:02,423 --> 00:59:03,950
I want to sit up a little.

660
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,031
You must rest.

661
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:07,308
Can you help me?

662
00:59:13,711 --> 00:59:14,758
Are you all right?

663
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:23,311
Yes, I am.

664
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:26,126
Mans intuition is no good.

665
00:59:28,463 --> 00:59:29,641
I'm sorry.

666
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:33,455
You wouldn't listen to the whispers...

667
00:59:33,455 --> 00:59:35,375
now you'll hear the screams.

668
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,487
A bit late.

669
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:40,783
Master...

670
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:43,718
Master, are you dead?
Tell me if you’re dead.

671
00:59:44,975 --> 00:59:46,095
Why are you on the floor?

672
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:49,839
Why do you never think?
You'll be joining me.

673
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:50,766
How?

674
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:13,000
Master, if you're lost,
why don't you ask?

675
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,267
We've walked all night

676
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,345
There's nobody around to ask.
We would seem suspicious.

677
01:00:16,751 --> 01:00:17,765
Get the box.

678
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:24,229
Master...

679
01:00:27,183 --> 01:00:28,328
Someone is here.

680
01:00:36,655 --> 01:00:40,079
You two fools are finished,
give me the Box.

681
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,999
Dream on.

682
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:43,428
Pansy, run away.

683
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:46,543
Master, be careful.

684
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,234
I will kill you.

685
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:55,560
Give me the box.

686
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:04,909
Give me the box.

687
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,463
Show me how it works.

688
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:11,215
I'll read the instructions.
Dry clean only, no bleach, no spin.

689
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:12,207
Shut up.

690
01:01:12,207 --> 01:01:13,516
Don’t open it.

691
01:01:38,287 --> 01:01:40,197
I'll kill you, monster.

692
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:50,821
Master.

693
01:01:54,766 --> 01:01:56,806
I've got a splitting headache!

694
01:02:14,959 --> 01:02:16,781
There's my chance, better grab it.

695
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,311
Master.

696
01:02:19,311 --> 01:02:23,055
Go and get the box or I won't be
able to face my ancestors.

697
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:29,449
Master, please, don't die.

698
01:02:33,774 --> 01:02:34,702
Pansy.

699
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:41,481
I'm very sorry.

700
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:29,099
Have you worked out,
where the Holy Scripture is hidden?

701
01:03:30,383 --> 01:03:32,106
Where is the diamond
that you promised to me?

702
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:39,304
Right, turn this.

703
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,544
Ga Yu?

704
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,275
Ga Yu gate!

705
01:03:55,076 --> 01:03:57,531
Tell the captain to go to Ga Yu gate.

706
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,540
I heard that, the one with the scripture...

707
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,140
will have an enchanted life...

708
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,060
All their dreams will come true.

709
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,004
Is it ok if I keep it then?

710
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:10,109
I'm doing this for love
to my country.

711
01:04:11,172 --> 01:04:15,588
What a pity, you can't see
the way benefiting both sides.

712
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:18,490
General, why not gain a little extra?

713
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:22,115
I am loyal to Japan.

714
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:24,319
Good for you, let's drink to it.

715
01:04:27,044 --> 01:04:28,026
All right.

716
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,644
In the opposition, I would have
made a very different decision.

717
01:04:32,644 --> 01:04:34,466
Self interest is not a crime.

718
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,308
But, it pays to be careful.

719
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:41,060
Greed can lead to an untimely death.

720
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,548
But the people are naturally greedy.

721
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,682
At least you’re honest,
and told me what's on your mind.

722
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,507
Cheers!

723
01:04:57,988 --> 01:05:00,410
You again?
How did you get here?

724
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,700
Without me, how could you
pull off this stunt?

725
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,944
Which one?

726
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:10,596
I know you know.

727
01:05:10,596 --> 01:05:11,652
I have no idea.

728
01:05:11,652 --> 01:05:13,375
- Come here.
- Yes.

729
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,380
No, damnit.

730
01:05:17,443 --> 01:05:19,779
We had an agreement.

731
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:21,028
I am the boss or not?

732
01:05:21,028 --> 01:05:23,684
You should be happy there are many of us.
You play boss to me like this!

733
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:25,604
Would you two stop it?

734
01:05:25,604 --> 01:05:27,844
Mind your own business,
it's between the two of us.

735
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:30,691
- Listen, arrest them.
- Yes.

736
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,356
- Arrest her.
- Yes.

737
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:42,211
What a shock,
we all agreed I'm in charge here.

738
01:05:42,211 --> 01:05:45,059
I was not trying to cheat,
I am an agent.

739
01:05:46,147 --> 01:05:48,057
Scumbags.

740
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:52,163
Open the door!

741
01:05:52,163 --> 01:05:55,235
Inform control:
Spy on board, we are returning.

742
01:05:55,235 --> 01:05:56,580
Yes...

743
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,787
Dry clean only, no bleach

744
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:00,097
What are you talking about?

745
01:06:01,828 --> 01:06:04,031
It’s you, don't move.

746
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:07,683
I am the commander
of this airplane, you surrender.

747
01:06:07,683 --> 01:06:10,436
That wasn't fair, they're all against me.

748
01:06:10,436 --> 01:06:12,548
Who's against you?
You, take over.

749
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:14,372
- I do not know how to fly.
- Just do it.

750
01:06:14,372 --> 01:06:15,459
It's an order!

751
01:06:15,459 --> 01:06:18,883
You pretended to be very sick,
just for my sympathy.

752
01:06:18,883 --> 01:06:22,435
I was very sick.
Just that you were a pushover.

753
01:06:22,435 --> 01:06:23,587
Pushover?

754
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:25,796
Open the door.

755
01:06:25,796 --> 01:06:27,803
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

756
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,795
Remember that night?
You lured me into that bath tub.

757
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,748
Trying to make me peep at your boobies.

758
01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:37,795
What nonsense,
I tried to keep you off!

759
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:40,675
In the truth, I tried
to please a little bit.

760
01:06:40,675 --> 01:06:42,435
Just a little bit?
I thought it was a lot.

761
01:06:42,435 --> 01:06:45,219
You are very arrogant,
it think you have the...

762
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:48,667
hots for the little girl out there.
Pervert.

763
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,955
I haven't finished.

764
01:06:53,955 --> 01:06:55,264
Nobody moves.

765
01:06:57,988 --> 01:06:59,267
Wait, don't be hasty.

766
01:06:59,267 --> 01:07:01,891
You're so beautiful,
why would he be interested in me?

767
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:04,160
Your skin is so soft and...

768
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,299
We all die together.

769
01:07:07,299 --> 01:07:10,179
- You do not have courage.
- But I have the weapon.

770
01:07:10,179 --> 01:07:12,995
I am a secret agent
and I am ready to die.

771
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,436
Good one.

772
01:07:14,436 --> 01:07:17,732
Very heroic.
Nationalism at 30.000 feet...

773
01:07:17,732 --> 01:07:19,363
such devotion to the duty.

774
01:07:19,363 --> 01:07:20,643
Listen up...

775
01:07:20,643 --> 01:07:25,443
These two are sacrificing themselves for us?
Right, let's go guys.

776
01:07:25,443 --> 01:07:26,850
Don’t be stupid.

777
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:30,308
- Adios, love bird.
- Why are you still here?

778
01:07:30,308 --> 01:07:33,763
All with the happy couple.
Have lots of children.

779
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:36,580
- With much health.
- Good luck you.

780
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,300
A marriage made in heaven.

781
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,932
Idiots, they're going to hell.

782
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:43,899
- Happy landing.
- That worse, what’s wrong with good bye.

783
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:50,841
What a devil is that?

784
01:07:54,052 --> 01:07:56,190
I'll get revenge, you won't get away.

785
01:07:57,219 --> 01:07:58,681
You're going to hell!

786
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,129
The monster.

787
01:08:06,852 --> 01:08:08,227
Do not force me.

788
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:09,572
I don't mind dying with you.

789
01:08:09,572 --> 01:08:11,427
He's speaking for himself, not me.

790
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:12,704
We'll all die.

791
01:08:17,283 --> 01:08:18,560
Give me that box.

792
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:24,291
Another lucky break, Master,
I kept it for you.

793
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,501
Cut the crap.

794
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:56,223
Save the Box.

795
01:08:57,891 --> 01:08:59,844
- Turbulence.
- I am not a good pilot.

796
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,120
I can see that.

797
01:09:07,684 --> 01:09:09,091
I am starting to learn.

798
01:09:24,387 --> 01:09:26,591
Don't panic.

799
01:09:41,923 --> 01:09:43,811
We do not have time
for romance.

800
01:09:47,075 --> 01:09:48,123
The Box.

801
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:54,904
Together.

802
01:09:59,907 --> 01:10:02,211
- You go first.
- And you?

803
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,427
There's only one parachute.

804
01:10:03,427 --> 01:10:06,051
- We go together.
- It will break.

805
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:07,393
See you later.

806
01:10:13,283 --> 01:10:17,668
Now I finally understand love.
Look at my dad...

807
01:10:17,668 --> 01:10:20,515
sacrificing his life
for the woman he loves.

808
01:10:20,515 --> 01:10:23,843
And her wanting to die with him.

809
01:10:32,068 --> 01:10:33,763
You should let me go.

810
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:35,523
The parachute can't take the weight.

811
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:36,931
This way we both die.

812
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:39,332
Better than life without you.

813
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:40,706
I am thinking...

814
01:10:42,435 --> 01:10:46,435
if this is the end for us,
then I don't mind.

815
01:10:46,435 --> 01:10:47,645
I agree.

816
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:04,377
You see?
God must be on our side.

817
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:08,701
Master...

818
01:11:09,923 --> 01:11:12,899
God must be on our side, we found the box.

819
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:14,525
I think God's gone now.

820
01:11:16,515 --> 01:11:18,108
Bad timing, Co-Pilot.

821
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,220
Come on.

822
01:11:21,859 --> 01:11:23,615
- I don't understand.
- I do.

823
01:11:38,756 --> 01:11:42,435
As we stand here,
it's the top of Ga Yu gate...

824
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:46,211
From what the sutra said,
the scripture with no words...

825
01:11:46,211 --> 01:11:48,643
is in the palace beneath the wall.

826
01:11:48,643 --> 01:11:51,491
The entrance must be
on the top of Ga Yu gate.

827
01:11:52,515 --> 01:11:54,628
The Box must be the key.

828
01:11:54,628 --> 01:11:55,740
It's the only way to enter.

829
01:11:56,867 --> 01:11:59,867
The doubt is:
Where is the door?

830
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:02,657
Search the place thoroughly.

831
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:35,677
Master, come here.

832
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,170
Put it in.

833
01:13:00,131 --> 01:13:01,408
Take it out.

834
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:46,680
Master, there's the scripture with no words.

835
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:50,467
- It is.
- Keep away.

836
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,507
Look around, it may not be that simple.

837
01:13:53,507 --> 01:13:54,555
Many people
have died here.

838
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:59,011
Taking the scripture could be difficult.

839
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:02,083
I think I give up.
This is not necessary.

840
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:05,507
Let's go, what we don't have, we won't miss.

841
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:09,085
No way, I've come this far, I won't give up.

842
01:14:10,692 --> 01:14:11,619
Careful.

843
01:14:14,307 --> 01:14:15,234
Catch it.

844
01:14:34,243 --> 01:14:36,315
I will not let you take the scripture.

845
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:42,211
Be careful...

846
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,738
She’s got the scripture.

847
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:52,222
- Give it to me.
- Catch it.

848
01:14:58,179 --> 01:15:00,121
- Die.
- You'll die.

849
01:15:07,843 --> 01:15:09,020
Evil monster.

850
01:15:31,203 --> 01:15:32,959
No advantage,
I'm out of here.

851
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,508
It won't work, I'm immortal.

852
01:16:06,211 --> 01:16:08,867
Never wanted this scripture.
A wise person would know that we could die.

853
01:16:08,867 --> 01:16:11,617
This isn't the time or place
to lay the guilt on me!

854
01:16:12,995 --> 01:16:14,339
She was rude to me.

855
01:16:14,339 --> 01:16:16,195
You women always say these things.

856
01:16:16,195 --> 01:16:17,886
Couldn't you just talk about this later?

857
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,454
Help me pull him up.

858
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:07,899
- Now what?
- Try again.

859
01:17:09,187 --> 01:17:11,260
I got the scripture, come and get it.

860
01:17:12,739 --> 01:17:14,016
Take this.

861
01:17:20,322 --> 01:17:21,664
How dare you?

862
01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:25,405
Die, die

863
01:17:26,403 --> 01:17:28,541
Die, die.

864
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:31,331
The scripture!

865
01:17:31,331 --> 01:17:32,858
Can’t hurt me.

866
01:17:38,339 --> 01:17:39,452
Run, Pansy.

867
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:08,062
Master, you take the right arm side and
the girls take his left hand side.

868
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:15,011
I can handle it!

869
01:18:15,011 --> 01:18:16,091
No chance.

870
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:23,101
The Box.

871
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:30,275
- You remember the rat?
- What?

872
01:18:30,275 --> 01:18:31,555
The rat in the press office.

873
01:18:31,555 --> 01:18:33,922
The light from the box will make him die!

874
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:37,304
Do it again.
It will make the thing die.

875
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:40,287
Don't touch the box.

876
01:18:51,778 --> 01:18:53,088
I'm coming.

877
01:18:53,987 --> 01:18:55,743
Master,
not a good idea.

878
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:04,066
You'll die.

879
01:19:05,283 --> 01:19:06,690
Hang on, Master.

880
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:16,127
Sign of what you're are thinking.
That you get me to vanish, too.

881
01:19:17,155 --> 01:19:18,300
No chance.

882
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:21,116
Monster, I will kill you.

883
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,893
The last chance.

884
01:19:41,731 --> 01:19:45,080
- These are yours or mine?
- They must be yours.

885
01:19:51,939 --> 01:19:55,011
Open the Box.
Shine the light on it.

886
01:19:55,011 --> 01:19:56,547
Don’t do it.

887
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:59,995
I can't hold it.
Hurry.

888
01:20:13,986 --> 01:20:18,595
Shine the light on it.

889
01:20:18,595 --> 01:20:21,245
Hurry, open the Box.

890
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:26,144
Open it now.

891
01:20:41,411 --> 01:20:42,491
Then what.

892
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:38,649
- What to do?
- I have no idea.

893
01:22:00,387 --> 01:22:04,381
All this is an illusion.

894
01:22:08,259 --> 01:22:12,707
I am the Monk Yuen Chong,
the scripture is not of this planet.

895
01:22:12,707 --> 01:22:14,979
You're at our power vortex.

896
01:22:14,979 --> 01:22:18,178
So I can't send you away
without a glimpse of glory.

897
01:22:18,178 --> 01:22:20,995
Does the future interest any of you?

898
01:22:20,995 --> 01:22:24,323
You bet it does.
Will I be married, Mr. Monk?

899
01:22:24,323 --> 01:22:27,868
Your destiny states, you will be married.

900
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,603
That is you!

901
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:43,425
What’s wrong with that?
We’re good together.

902
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:47,008
And I wanna see my greatest achievement.

903
01:22:55,459 --> 01:22:57,027
It's the same one.

904
01:22:57,027 --> 01:22:59,132
We should never have asked.

905
01:23:00,451 --> 01:23:02,076
Don't be sad.

906
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:08,323
Adventure King...

907
01:23:08,323 --> 01:23:11,234
aren't you interested in
what the future holds?

908
01:23:11,234 --> 01:23:14,530
The scripture had the key, we forgot why.

909
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,979
Is our greed an illusion you think?

910
01:23:18,979 --> 01:23:21,059
They are, thank God.

911
01:23:21,059 --> 01:23:22,498
Humans fear life.

912
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:25,793
So they fight it, and try to control it.

913
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:29,411
Bad actions catch up with people.

914
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:32,643
But what goes around comes around.

915
01:23:32,643 --> 01:23:37,564
If you let it, love is stronger than evil.

916
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,380
Japan surrendered.

917
01:24:10,275 --> 01:24:12,834
Love is not exclusive.

918
01:24:12,834 --> 01:24:16,643
Each human being is loved equally by God.

919
01:24:16,643 --> 01:24:21,570
In that way, humans must
learn to love each other.

920
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:25,666
This will end fear, and people will realize...

921
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:31,776
that knowing we are all one, will create peace.

922
01:24:44,739 --> 01:24:48,898
It all becomes clear,
Controlling comes out of atrocity.

923
01:24:48,898 --> 01:24:52,994
If we start trusting god,
we won't need to fear life.

924
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:55,555
After this Pao stopped working for my dad...

925
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:59,651
in the search of the truth.
Instead... he went off to raise a family

926
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:02,594
Pansy did as foretold,
and were very happy.

927
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:06,338
But my father could never settle down.
This story ends here.

928
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:09,634
But Adventure King had many more adventures.
