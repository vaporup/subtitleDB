1
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:02,021
They were heard screaming at each
other for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:05,252
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,119
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:10,021
Yeah.

5
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:13,295
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:16,029
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:21,966
Did the kid see it?

8
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,100
What?

9
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:24,735
The kid?

10
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:27,547
What kind of question's that?

11
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:33,045
We'll be real glad when we get rid of
you, Somerset. Always these questions.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,818
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

13
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,826
He's dead.
His wife killed him.

14
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:41,556
Anything else has nothing
to do with us.

15
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:51,861
Detective Somerset?

16
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,067
I'm Detective Mills.

17
00:01:57,312 --> 00:02:00,941
Just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

18
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:01,983
Look...

19
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:03,915
Mills?

20
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:08,854
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.

21
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:11,586
Not much time for
this transition thing.

22
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,927
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

23
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:16,861
Yeah.

24
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,660
Why here?

25
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:22,027
I don't follow.

26
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:24,867
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

27
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,498
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

28
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:33,945
Same reason as you. Or the reason
you had before you decided to quit.

29
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:38,051
You just met me.

30
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:41,553
Maybe I don't understand the question.

31
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,381
It's very simple.

32
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:48,790
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

33
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:53,227
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

34
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:57,739
It'd be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

35
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,803
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

36
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:06,748
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?

37
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:10,980
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.

38
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:12,748
- Not here.
- I understand.

39
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:17,259
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,
do me the favor of remembering that.

40
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,936
SE7EN

41
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:17,608
MONDAY

42
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:21,511
MONDAY

43
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:03,486
Yeah.

44
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,045
Okay.

45
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,383
Say it again?

46
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:14,493
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

47
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,232
Serpico's got to go.

48
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,742
Well, you might want
to get rid of this little...

49
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,404
crusty, this eye, Serpico.

50
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,242
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

51
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,407
Good.

52
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,193
Coffee?

53
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,037
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

54
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,872
What time was death established?

55
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,377
Like I said...

56
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,037
I didn't touch anything...

57
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,209
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

58
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,049
Wait. No one bothers
with vital signs?

59
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:12,990
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing
unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

60
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,324
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.

61
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:21,231
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up

62
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,659
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.

63
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,666
Thank you.

64
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,539
I wonder.

65
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:43,180
What was the point of the conversation
you were about to get into?

66
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:48,085
Don't know. How many times Barney Five
found dead bodies that weren't dead.

67
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,423
Drop it.

68
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:25,290
Somebody phone Guiness.
I think we've got a record here.

69
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,973
Better Homes and Gardens.

70
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,783
Spaghetti Sauce

71
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:56,554
Who said this was murder?

72
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,259
No one.

73
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:01,998
Guy's heart must be the size...

74
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,435
of a canned ham.

75
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:08,669
If this isn't a coronary...

76
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:09,835
well...

77
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:11,943
I don't know.

78
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:30,359
Whoops.

79
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,370
How about that.

80
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,442
We had this case once...

81
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:54,378
guy dead on the ground...

82
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:56,287
knife in his back.
Murder...

83
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:57,654
right?

84
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:00,820
Fuck!

85
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:05,059
Anyway, big insurance policy involved,
yeah? So the guy...

86
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,624
took the tip of the blade...

87
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:09,102
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

88
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:12,197
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...

89
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,105
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:25,615
Wait a minute.

91
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:26,712
What?

92
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,050
Got a bucket here.

93
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,253
What's in it?

94
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,295
Oh God!

95
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:41,961
Fucking vomit.

96
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:45,603
Any blood in it?

97
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:48,576
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,817
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:59,577
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,316
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,484
You girls have got forensics
waiting outside.

102
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,089
We might not fit.

103
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:08,653
There's room. Light's the problem.

104
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:10,028
How are you?

105
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,327
Det. Mills, go help the officers...

106
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:14,927
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:18,834
What?

108
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,638
And send in forensics.

109
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,690
He's dead.

110
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,629
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,204
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,529
Nope.

113
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:57,804
I did door-to-doors and walked
the beat. I did that shit...

114
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:58,973
a long time.

115
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:01,878
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:04,853
"detective".
That's the same as yours.

117
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:08,215
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:11,656
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene...

119
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:15,323
not whether you were getting
enough time on the field.

120
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,490
Hey, man...

121
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:21,896
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.

122
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:29,677
He's been dead...

123
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:32,409
a long time, and not from poison.

124
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:33,916
Oh, man.

125
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:36,078
How can you let yourself go like that?

126
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:39,521
It took 4 orderlies just
to get him on the table.

127
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:47,430
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.

128
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,592
Look. See how big this stomach is?

129
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:53,535
And the strange thing is,
it stretches.

130
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:56,767
Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

131
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:59,605
I see that, but it means
nothing to me.

132
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:02,202
Okay, he's got lines of distention...

133
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,872
across the duodenum.

134
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,575
The interior wall's ripped open.

135
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:09,709
This man ate till he burst?

136
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:14,724
He didn't really burst. Not all the
way. He was hemorrhaging internally.

137
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,625
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

138
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:20,892
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?

139
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,125
Yes and no.

140
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:26,199
What about these bruises here?

141
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,963
I haven't figured that out yet.

142
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,975
Gun pressed against his head?

143
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,476
Pressed hard enough.

144
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:34,738
Fuck, yeah.

145
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:37,741
On the front, flush with the muzzle.

146
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:43,321
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

147
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:50,754
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving. Took his time too.

148
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,764
Coroner said it could have lasted
more than 12 hours.

149
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:57,165
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort...

150
00:14:57,235 --> 00:15:00,102
and there was a point
when he passed out.

151
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:02,333
That's when the killer kicked him...

152
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:04,341
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

153
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,676
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

154
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:10,613
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this...

155
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:13,617
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.

156
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:18,489
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy
and tortured him. Simple as that.

157
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:19,819
In the grocery bags...

158
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:23,418
we found 2 receipts. So,
the killer stopped and went back...

159
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:25,019
to the supermarket.

160
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:26,924
So?

161
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:31,800
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

162
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,861
- This is beginning.
- We've got...

163
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,804
one dead guy, not three.

164
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:37,034
No motive.

165
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:40,637
Don't start that big brain of yours...

166
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:42,304
cooking on this, alright?

167
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,715
I'd like to be reassigned.

168
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,043
Whoa.

169
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,384
What are you talking about?

170
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:51,389
This can't be my last duty.

171
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,119
It'll go on and on.

172
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,220
You're retiring in 6 days.

173
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:59,321
You've left unfinished
business before.

174
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,392
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible.

175
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:06,671
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.

176
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,502
It's his first assignment.

177
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:12,567
I knew it. This is not
my first assignment, you dick.

178
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:13,839
It's too soon.

179
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:17,246
I'm here. You can say that
shit to my face. Captain?

180
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:18,510
It's too soon for you.

181
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:20,574
Captain...

182
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:22,746
Can we talk in private?

183
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,255
This is a personal thing--

184
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:26,090
Just shut up, Mills.

185
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,024
I don't have anyone else...

186
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:31,427
to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...

187
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:34,398
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

188
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:39,033
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

189
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:40,367
Give it to me.

190
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,408
I'll put you on something else.

191
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,241
Go on, Mills, just go on.

192
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:56,551
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck...

193
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:58,385
cleaning up the fat man.

194
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:05,833
TUESDAY

195
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,996
TUESDAY

196
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:13,702
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!

197
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,605
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED

198
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:18,201
Quiet down.

199
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,545
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

200
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:23,606
Quiet down.

201
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:28,720
Here's how it'll work:

202
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,884
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

203
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,295
Ask those questions in a calm, sane,
orderly fashion or I will leave.

204
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,230
Detective? Detective?

205
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,234
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

206
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:52,138
I won't discuss the details of this
investigation, so don't bother asking.

207
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:12,993
What you got for me?

208
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,591
Nothing yet, boss.

209
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:21,069
Why don't you guys go get
a coffee, huh?

210
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:26,775
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...

211
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:29,442
Eli Gould was found murdered today.

212
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:33,954
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.

213
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:40,457
That's ridiculous and offensive.

214
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:45,363
There is no conflict, and any claim
there could be is irresponsible.

215
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,963
Now hold on.

216
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:53,371
I just met with law enforcement
officials and they...

217
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:57,673
assured me that they have their
very best men on this.

218
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:00,706
This will be the very definition...

219
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,483
of swift justice.

220
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:07,721
GREED

221
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:28,835
Pardon me, George.

222
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:34,339
Somerset.

223
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,576
Come in.

224
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,352
You heard the news?

225
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,853
Nope, haven't heard.

226
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,755
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

227
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:46,261
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

228
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:49,357
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

229
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,968
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

230
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,406
Mills is heading the investigation.

231
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,977
Excuse me. Excuse me.

232
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,440
Don't do that, please?

233
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,515
Good for him.

234
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,019
What will you do...

235
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,180
with yourself out there, Somerset?

236
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,521
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

237
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,026
Don't you feel it?

238
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:21,291
Don't you feel that feeling?

239
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,691
You're not going to be a cop anymore.

240
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,530
That's the whole idea.

241
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,703
I don't think you'll leave.

242
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:32,632
Hell, you can't leave all this.

243
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:37,036
Guy's out walking his dog.

244
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:38,637
Gets attacked.

245
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,643
His watch is taken, his wallet.

246
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,049
And while he's lying...

247
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,711
on the sidewalk helpless...

248
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:48,219
his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

249
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:52,591
This happened last night
about 4 blocks from here.

250
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:54,521
I read about it.

251
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,365
I don't understand anymore.

252
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,632
It's the way it's always been.

253
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:03,571
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.

254
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,733
I don't think you can deny that.

255
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,400
Maybe I'm wrong.

256
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:12,978
The coroner sent this down for you.

257
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,084
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach...

258
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,922
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...

259
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,752
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

260
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:27,586
They were...

261
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:28,892
fed to him.

262
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,422
Lord.

263
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,264
GLUTTONY

264
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:22,213
This was found behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene.

265
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:25,210
"Long is the way

266
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:28,548
And hard, that out of hell
leads up to light."

267
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,882
It's from Milton.

268
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,056
"Paradise Lost."

269
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:33,613
Alright...

270
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:34,886
I'm confused.

271
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,394
It means that this is beginning.

272
00:23:37,462 --> 00:23:38,724
GLUTTONY

273
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,890
This was behind
the same refrigerator...

274
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:43,290
written in grease.

275
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:45,461
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

276
00:23:46,037 --> 00:23:47,299
Gluttony...

277
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:50,964
greed...

278
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,573
sloth, wrath...

279
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:57,774
pride, lust...

280
00:23:58,383 --> 00:23:59,577
and envy.

281
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,143
Seven.

282
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:02,151
Hold on.

283
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:05,053
This is not even my desk.

284
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,222
You can expect five more of these.

285
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:11,057
Wait a minute.

286
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:14,491
I can't get involved in this.

287
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:17,930
Somerset.

288
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:19,766
He wanted it.

289
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:22,601
Damn!

290
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,165
I'm all over it.

291
00:24:58,678 --> 00:24:59,645
Where to?

292
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:04,816
Far away from here.

293
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,388
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.

294
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,161
Sit where you'd like.

295
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:23,266
How's everybody?

296
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:25,828
Hiya, Smiley.

297
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:28,768
George, the cards are getting cold.

298
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:30,671
Duty calls.

299
00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:48,254
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...

300
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:50,463
I'll never understand.

301
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:53,528
All these books...

302
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,034
a world of knowledge right here...

303
00:25:56,103 --> 00:25:57,263
and what do you do?

304
00:25:58,105 --> 00:25:59,595
You play poker all night.

305
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:02,041
Hey, we got culture.

306
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:04,703
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

307
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:09,944
How's this for culture?

308
00:26:38,946 --> 00:26:40,777

Dante's Purgatory
The Canterbury Tales

313
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,265
was crimson with his blood:

314
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,380
Even children slain!

315
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:49,305
You know, Smiley...

316
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,080
you'll really miss us.

317
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,316
I just might.

WEDNESDAY

322
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,801
Fucking Dante.

323
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:59,439
Goddamn poetry-writing fatggot
piece of shit.

324
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:01,041
Fucker.

325
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,719
Good work, Officer.

326
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,501
Thank you, Lord.

327
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:32,005
Oh, oh, sorry.

328
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,415
I'll move in a second.

329
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:50,526
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.

330
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,431
Yeah?

331
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:31,104
Phone.

332
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:34,745
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

333
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:40,908
Mills.

334
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,812
Honey...

335
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,752
You okay? Something wrong?

336
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,622
You dingleberry, I told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

337
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:52,262
Yeah. Why?

338
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,332
Why?

339
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:02,334
Okay.

340
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:07,438
It's my wife.

341
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:08,972
Sorry?

342
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:11,909
She'd like to speak to you.

343
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,859
This is Detective Somerset.

344
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:28,629
Well, yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

345
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:32,635
I appreciate the offer, but...

346
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,471
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.

347
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:40,378
Yes, thank you very much.

348
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:42,706
Bye.

349
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:46,713
Honey, what...?

350
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:56,160
Well?

351
00:32:56,228 --> 00:32:57,525
Sorry?

352
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:03,232
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

353
00:33:03,302 --> 00:33:05,133
At my... How's that?

354
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:06,737
Tonight.

355
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:15,747
Hello, men.

356
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:17,077
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:21,317
That's Tracy. Tracy...

358
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:24,181
Hello.

359
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,057
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,318
Except your first name.

361
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:32,928
It's William.

362
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,931
Well, it's a good name...

363
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:37,026
William.

364
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:39,932
William, I'd like you to meet David.

365
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:43,942
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

366
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,207
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.

367
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:50,778
Aw, good dogs.

368
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:53,786
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

369
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:06,390
Smells good.

370
00:34:08,435 --> 00:34:10,733
Yeah, I mean, thank you.

371
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:13,735
Please have a seat, if you like.

372
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:17,800
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.

373
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:21,742
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

374
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:23,476
We're still unpacking.

375
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:28,646
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

376
00:34:31,057 --> 00:34:32,649
Pretty hokey, huh?

377
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:35,327
You know something?

378
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:38,421
On our first date I knew he was...

379
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:39,988
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

380
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,833
He was the funniest guy I ever met.

381
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:49,736
Really.

382
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:55,281
It's kind of rare nowadays.

383
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:57,613
I mean, that level of...

384
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:58,777
commitment.

385
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:05,024
Oh, don't worry.

386
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:07,857
I won't wear it to the dinner table.

387
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,792
No matter...

388
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:13,527
how often I see guns,
I just can't...

389
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:15,034
get used to them.

390
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:17,331
Same here.

391
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:30,310
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.

392
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:31,646
What the hell?

393
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,414
I was close once.

394
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:35,750
It just didn't happen.

395
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:37,757
It surprises me.

396
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:39,916
It really does.

397
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:42,353
Well...

398
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:47,995
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

399
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:50,336
Just ask your husband.

400
00:35:50,404 --> 00:35:51,496
Very true.

401
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,670
Very, very true.

402
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:56,501
How long have you lived here?

403
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:58,438
Too long.

404
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:03,748
How do you like it?

405
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:06,847
You know...

406
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,688
takes time. Settle in...

407
00:36:10,926 --> 00:36:12,416
it'll be good.

408
00:36:12,494 --> 00:36:14,621
Well, you get numb after awhile

409
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:18,032
There are things to any city...

410
00:36:23,772 --> 00:36:24,966
Subway.

411
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:27,467
It'll go away in a minute.

412
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:32,874
This real estate guy.

413
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:36,142
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.

414
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:40,317
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

415
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:43,051
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.

416
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:47,827
Then I start wondering why he'll only
bring us here 5 minutes at a time.

417
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,796
We found out the first night.

418
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:52,564
The soothing, relaxing...

419
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:54,899
vibrating home, huh?

420
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:04,743
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:13,855
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

422
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:18,992
I don't know why you're laughing.

423
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:24,527
Alright, already.

424
00:37:28,604 --> 00:37:30,765
He had to get into the building...

425
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,867
before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?

426
00:37:34,944 --> 00:37:38,175
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

427
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:41,614
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.

428
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:46,121
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.

429
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:49,249
Laid low till the cleaning crew left,
then had...

430
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:52,783
his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

431
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:54,126
Look.

432
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:56,995
Gould was bound, right arm free.

433
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,227
He was handed a butcher's knife.

434
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:03,104
Check out the scale.

435
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:04,434
A pound of flesh.

436
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:12,647
"One pound of flesh"

437
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:15,206
"No more no less
No cartilage...

438
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:16,478
No bone....

439
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:18,918
only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."

440
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:20,320
Didn't see it.

441
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:23,451
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".

442
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:25,654
I tell you that chair was...

443
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:28,425
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.

444
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,830
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time...

445
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:34,327
deciding which cut....

446
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:35,599
to make first.

447
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:37,605
Imagine it.

448
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:39,505
There's a gun in your face.

449
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:42,475
Which part of your body
is expendable?

450
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,842
The love handle.

451
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:47,943
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

452
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:52,651
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...

453
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:56,181
Iook through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

454
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,288
The trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

455
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:03,799
until it's an exhausted possibility.

456
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:05,835
I'll get another beer. Beer?

457
00:39:05,903 --> 00:39:07,700
Wine, please.

458
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:17,978
He's preaching.

459
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:19,877
Punishing.

460
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,877
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

461
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:27,849
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...

462
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:31,191
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...

463
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:34,959
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?

464
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,159
Yeah.

465
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:38,702
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...

466
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,264
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill
and check out all the sinners?

467
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:48,105
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.

468
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:51,546
But there pride comes first,
not gluttony.

469
00:39:51,616 --> 00:39:53,106
For now let's consider...

470
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:56,176
the books as the killer's inspiration.

471
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:59,223
The sermons were about atonement
for sin.

472
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,724
These murders are like
forced attrition.

473
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:03,283
Forced what?

474
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,558
Attrition's when you regret your sins,
but not because...

475
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:10,533
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.

476
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:15,566
No fingerprints.

477
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,073
Nope.

478
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:20,235
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.

479
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:23,075
And no witnesses of any kind.

480
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:24,808
Which I don't get...

481
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,818
because the fucker
had to get back out.

482
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,986
In any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

483
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:37,285
In rape prevention, the first thing
they teach you is never cry for help.

484
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:39,757
Always yell, "Fire!".

485
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,264
Nobody answers help.

486
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:43,358
Holler "fire," they'll come.

487
00:40:43,435 --> 00:40:45,164
That's fucked up.

488
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:48,001
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

489
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:54,341
You know what? Thank you for talking
this out, but I must sleep.

490
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:56,009
Walk the dogs.

491
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,606
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.

492
00:40:58,684 --> 00:41:02,677
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

493
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,282
Gould's wife. She was out of town
at the time.

494
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,692
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

495
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:14,790
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

496
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:25,303
What if it isn't what she has seen...

497
00:41:25,377 --> 00:41:29,609
but what she's supposed to see
but hasn't had the chance?

498
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:31,479
Yeah, okay. What?

499
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,040
I don't know.

500
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,821
But that's the one thing.

501
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:23,599
I'll sign us in.

502
00:42:24,104 --> 00:42:25,594
Must see Mrs. Gould.

503
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:33,710
Mrs. Gould?

504
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:42,413
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

505
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:44,920
I don't understand.

506
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:47,986
I need you to look at each photo...

507
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:50,122
very carefully.

508
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:53,791
Look and see if there's anything
strange or...

509
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:56,461
out of place, anything at all.

510
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,735
I don't see anything.

511
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:02,300
Please, I can't do this right now.

512
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:03,467
Okay.

513
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:06,135
It's got to be now.

514
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:08,147
There may be something we missed.

515
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:18,919
Wait.

516
00:43:18,993 --> 00:43:19,960
What?

517
00:43:20,027 --> 00:43:21,085
Here.

518
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:27,659
This painting, it's upside down.

519
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:37,502
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

520
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:39,944
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

521
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:44,509
Nothing.

522
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:47,778
There's got to be something.

523
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:01,361
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

524
00:44:05,706 --> 00:44:07,298
What the fuck is that?

525
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:10,209
Switchblade.

526
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:20,149
Goddamn it.

527
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,892
There must be something.

528
00:44:31,066 --> 00:44:33,159
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

529
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:44,045
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

530
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,477
See this, this is us.

531
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:50,912
Just wait a minute.

532
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:57,021
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:04,462
You're kidding me.

534
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,524
Call the print lab.

535
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:13,104
Oh, man.

536
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:18,044
Honestly...

537
00:45:18,113 --> 00:45:20,707
have you ever seen anything like this?

538
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,479
HELP ME

539
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:29,491
The swell pattern tells me
that they're not...

540
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,823
the victim's fingerprints.

541
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:44,071
I don't know, man.

542
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,267
I say he's whacked enough.

543
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,204
It doesn't fit.

544
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:51,673
He doesn't want to stop.

545
00:45:51,747 --> 00:45:52,839
Who knows.

546
00:45:52,915 --> 00:45:57,079
Freaks out there doing their
evil deeds they don't want to do.

547
00:45:57,153 --> 00:45:59,678
"The voices made me do it".

548
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:01,689
"Jodie Foster made me do it".

549
00:46:01,757 --> 00:46:03,224
It can take...

550
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:07,388
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to cross...

551
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:09,192
your fingers somewhere else.

552
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:15,703
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

553
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:17,534
About catching this guy.

554
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:23,637
Wish I still thought
the way you did.

555
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:28,481
Tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing?

556
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:31,250
Picking up the pieces.

557
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:37,659
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples...

558
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,821
writing everything down...

559
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,229
noting the time things happened.

560
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,659
That's all?

561
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,827
That's all.

562
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:50,670
Putting everything into neat piles
and filing it away...

563
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,733
on the off chance it'll be needed
in the courtroom.

564
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,679
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island...

565
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,914
saving them in case we get rescued.

566
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,014
Bullshit.

567
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,561
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

568
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,367
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

569
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,934
Don't try to tell me you didn't
get that rush tonight.

570
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,543
I saw you.

571
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,437
We're getting somewhere.

572
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:41,625
THURSDAY

573
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,185
THURSDAY

574
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,626
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

575
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,559
We got a winner.

576
00:47:56,774 --> 00:48:00,540
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

577
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,239
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

578
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:06,977
He's got a long history
of serious mental illnesses.

579
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,713
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

580
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,247
Somewhere along the line
they fell short.

581
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:16,816
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery
and assault, spent time...

582
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,091
in prison for the attempted rape
of a minor.

583
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:23,998
His lawyer made sure that didn't
last long. By the way...

584
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,832
the lawyer was Eli Gould,
the "greed" victim.

585
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,604
We'll stop this today,
ladies and germs.

586
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:34,168
Victor's been out of circulation for
awhile, but we've a residence for him.

587
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,770
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...

588
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:38,440
Iike our guy, does it?

589
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:39,574
You tell me.

590
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,913
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

591
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:13,274
You ever take a bullet?

592
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:16,480
Never in my thirty-four years,
knock on wood.

593
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,882
I've only taken my gun out...

594
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,483
3 times wanting to use it.

595
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:24,222
Never pulled the trigger.

596
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:25,490
Not once.

597
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:26,861
You?

598
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:31,233
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet,
but...

599
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:33,897
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

600
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,065
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

601
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,336
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,243
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

603
00:49:41,647 --> 00:49:46,414
We bust open the door looking for this
junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.

604
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:49,587
One cop got hit in the arm.

605
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:53,352
Christ, what was his name?

606
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,420
It spun him like a top... no, Well,
more, you know, more like slow motion.

607
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,425
I remember...

608
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:05,695
riding in that ambulance...

609
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:07,102
and, well...

610
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:08,605
he died right there.

611
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,201
Right there.

612
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,341
Christ, what was his fucking name?

613
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:33,783
SWAT goes before dicks.

614
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:39,021
They love this.

615
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:40,992
Police!

616
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:47,196
Clear!

617
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:13,332
Good morning, sweetheart.

618
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:17,399
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!

619
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,410
Get up, you sack of shit.

620
00:52:35,323 --> 00:52:36,483
Oh, fuck me.

621
00:52:37,092 --> 00:52:38,024
Dicks!

622
00:52:38,727 --> 00:52:40,854
You'll want to come
take a look at this.

623
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:45,358
Dicks!

624
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:53,936
Jesus.

625
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:55,203
Victor?

626
00:52:55,277 --> 00:52:57,711
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

627
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:59,440
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?

628
00:52:59,514 --> 00:53:00,879
Hearse, I'd say.

629
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:02,439
Call for forensics.

630
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:04,109
Get your people out.

631
00:53:04,185 --> 00:53:05,948
No one touches anything.

632
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:08,353
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.

633
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,622
Sloth.

634
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:24,565
Aw, man.

635
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:25,901
Goddamn.

636
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:28,740
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.

637
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:38,576
This must be the first.

638
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:39,517
Look.

639
00:53:40,322 --> 00:53:42,813
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

640
00:53:44,727 --> 00:53:46,592
I got a hair sample. I got a...

641
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:48,926
stool sample. I got piss. I got...

642
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:50,329
fingernails.

643
00:53:52,668 --> 00:53:54,067
He's laughing at us.

644
00:53:54,136 --> 00:53:56,434
You got what you deserved.

645
00:54:00,343 --> 00:54:01,776
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!

646
00:54:02,845 --> 00:54:04,176
Guns down!

647
00:54:04,246 --> 00:54:06,510
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

648
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,260
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.

649
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:31,138
We must forget our emotion.

650
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:36,201
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?

651
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:37,711
Are you listening to me?

652
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,270
Yes, I can hear you.

653
00:54:39,348 --> 00:54:41,043
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

654
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:43,881
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.

655
00:54:43,953 --> 00:54:45,318
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.

656
00:54:46,322 --> 00:54:48,347
I got a fucking right to be here.

657
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:50,255
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.

658
00:54:50,326 --> 00:54:52,260
I got your picture, man.

659
00:54:52,328 --> 00:54:54,592
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.

660
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:57,531
Detective Mills.
M-l-L-L-S. Fuck off.

661
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:59,364
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!

662
00:55:00,203 --> 00:55:02,603
How they get here so fucking quick?

663
00:55:02,672 --> 00:55:06,267
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.

664
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:08,934
Hey man, I'm sorry.

665
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:12,447
They piss me off.

666
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:13,778
It's okay.

667
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,478
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

668
00:55:23,393 --> 00:55:28,660
1 year of immobility's right, judging
by the muscle and spine deterioration.

669
00:55:28,732 --> 00:55:32,395
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

670
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:37,338
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep
the bed sores from infecting.

671
00:55:37,974 --> 00:55:42,070
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

672
00:55:42,145 --> 00:55:45,012
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

673
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:47,572
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

674
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:51,018
Doc.

675
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:55,247
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

676
00:55:56,092 --> 00:56:00,756
He'd die of shock right now if you
shone a flashlight in his eyes.

677
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:06,433
He's had as much pain and suffering as
anyone I've encountered, give or take

678
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:10,099
and he still has hell
to look forward to.

679
00:56:10,508 --> 00:56:11,770
Good night.

680
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:26,450
Hello, William.

681
00:56:26,524 --> 00:56:28,116
It's Tracy.

682
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:29,751
Tracy?

683
00:56:30,394 --> 00:56:31,452
Everything okay?

684
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:34,730
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

685
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:35,925
Where's David?

686
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,299
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

687
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,396
I'm sorry to call you like this.

688
00:56:42,473 --> 00:56:43,963
Oh, it's all right.

689
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:46,443
What can I do for you?

690
00:56:52,049 --> 00:56:54,074
I need someone to talk...

691
00:56:54,151 --> 00:56:57,086
to. Do you think you could meet me...

692
00:56:57,154 --> 00:56:59,452
somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?

693
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:01,983
I don't understand.

694
00:57:03,227 --> 00:57:06,094
I feel stupid calling, but...

695
00:57:07,398 --> 00:57:10,492
you're the only person
that I know here.

696
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:12,460
There's no one else.

697
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:14,429
If you can...

698
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:16,996
just give me a call, okay?

699
00:57:17,074 --> 00:57:18,770
I have to go now.

700
00:57:19,578 --> 00:57:20,670
Good night.

701
00:57:20,746 --> 00:57:21,770
Good night.

702
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:26,585
FRIDAY

703
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:29,179
FRIDAY

704
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,382
I mean...

705
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:35,055
you know this city so well.

706
00:57:35,961 --> 00:57:37,394
You've been here...

707
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:38,986
so long.

708
00:57:40,766 --> 00:57:42,324
It can be a hard place.

709
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:45,460
I don't know why I asked you to come.

710
00:57:47,105 --> 00:57:49,198
Why don't you talk to him about it?

711
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:51,303
Tell him how you feel.

712
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:55,478
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.

713
00:57:55,547 --> 00:57:57,310
Especially now.

714
00:57:59,284 --> 00:58:01,377
I'll get used to things...

715
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:02,647
you know?

716
00:58:02,721 --> 00:58:04,882
I wanted to talk to someone...

717
00:58:04,957 --> 00:58:07,653
who's lived here for a long time.

718
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:13,195
I mean, upstate, it's
a completely different environment.

719
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:21,634
Did David tell you that I teach
fifth grade? Well, I did.

720
00:58:23,408 --> 00:58:25,171
Yeah, he mentioned it.

721
00:58:28,413 --> 00:58:31,406
I've been going around,
looking at schools...

722
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:35,746
but the conditions here are...

723
00:58:36,155 --> 00:58:37,588
horrible.

724
00:58:39,425 --> 00:58:41,086
What about private schools?

725
00:58:43,496 --> 00:58:44,520
I don't know.

726
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:48,990
Tell me what's really bothering you.

727
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:54,205
David and I are going to have a baby.

728
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:00,438
Oh, Tracy. I...

729
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:03,548
I don't think I'm the one...

730
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:05,548
to talk to...

731
00:59:05,618 --> 00:59:08,382
- about this.
- I hate this city.

732
00:59:12,692 --> 00:59:14,717
I had a relationship once...

733
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:17,625
it was very much like a marriage.

734
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:22,125
We got pregnant.

735
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:25,530
This was a long time ago.

736
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,302
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

737
00:59:36,382 --> 00:59:40,820
Just a day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew...

738
00:59:41,488 --> 00:59:42,420
about the pregnancy.

739
00:59:44,391 --> 00:59:46,757
And I felt this fear...

740
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,158
the first time ever.

741
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:53,098
I remember thinking...

742
00:59:53,867 --> 00:59:57,166
how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

743
00:59:57,237 --> 01:00:00,172
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

744
01:00:07,848 --> 01:00:10,180
I told her I didn't want to have it.

745
01:00:12,352 --> 01:00:14,320
And over the next few weeks...

746
01:00:15,522 --> 01:00:17,183
I wore her down.

747
01:00:20,027 --> 01:00:21,961
I want to have children.

748
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,625
I can tell you now that...

749
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:31,868
I know... I mean...

750
01:00:33,774 --> 01:00:35,708
I'm positive that...

751
01:00:35,776 --> 01:00:38,472
I made the right decision.

752
01:00:38,545 --> 01:00:41,708
But not a day passes
that I don't wish...

753
01:00:41,782 --> 01:00:44,478
that I had made a different choice.

754
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:49,555
If you don't...

755
01:00:49,623 --> 01:00:50,715
keep...

756
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,223
the baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

757
01:00:57,298 --> 01:00:59,892
don't ever tell him you were pregnant.

758
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:04,563
but if you choose to have the baby...

759
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,730
then spoil that kid...

760
01:01:06,808 --> 01:01:08,571
every chance you get.

761
01:01:15,483 --> 01:01:16,541
That's...

762
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:17,744
about...

763
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:20,185
all the advice I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:01:27,328 --> 01:01:28,260
I must go.

765
01:01:29,264 --> 01:01:30,526
William.

766
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:38,936
Thank you.

767
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:48,103
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust

768
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:56,878
Victor's landlord said there was cash
in the mail box...

769
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,611
the first of every month.

770
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,381
Quote:

771
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:07,759
"l never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

772
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:11,457
in apartment 306, and nobody
ever complained about him.

773
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:13,624
The best tenant I've ever had."

774
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,066
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.

775
01:02:16,136 --> 01:02:18,104
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

776
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:19,832
Who pays the rent on time.

777
01:02:20,707 --> 01:02:22,641
I'm sick of this waiting.

778
01:02:22,709 --> 01:02:23,869
This is the job.

779
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:26,804
Why aren't we out there?

780
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,475
Why must we sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic...

781
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:31,983
does it again?

782
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:35,146
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

783
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:37,918
Come on, he's insane. Look.

784
01:02:37,991 --> 01:02:42,155
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

785
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:44,595
Yeah, rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

786
01:02:45,532 --> 01:02:46,590
How's that?

787
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:47,997
I don't think so.

788
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:51,431
His luck'll run out.

789
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:54,431
He's not depending on luck.

790
01:02:57,511 --> 01:03:01,777
We walked in there exactly 1 year
after he tied Victor to the bed.

791
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:03,611
One year to the day.

792
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:05,947
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

793
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:07,453
Oh, yes, we do.

794
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:10,284
This note he left...

795
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:12,625
his first words to us.

796
01:03:12,693 --> 01:03:15,389
"Long is the way, and Hard,
that out of hell...

797
01:03:15,463 --> 01:03:16,794
Ieads up to Light."

798
01:03:18,933 --> 01:03:20,525
Fuck him. So what?

799
01:03:20,601 --> 01:03:21,966
He's right, so far.

800
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:27,031
Imagine the will it takes to keep
a man bound for a full year.

801
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:29,542
To sever his hand and to use it...

802
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,134
to plant fingerprints.

803
01:03:31,212 --> 01:03:34,113
To insert tubes into his genitals.

804
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:37,151
This guy's methodical, exacting...

805
01:03:37,218 --> 01:03:39,482
and worst of all, patient.

806
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:41,488
He's a nutbag.

807
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:45,492
Because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

808
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,158
You got money?

809
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:53,566
I got 50. Fifty bucks.

810
01:03:53,634 --> 01:03:56,068
I propose a field trip. Come on.

811
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:02,740
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...

812
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:06,746
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating
to the 7 deadly sins.

813
01:04:06,814 --> 01:04:08,247
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

814
01:04:08,316 --> 01:04:11,342
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

815
01:04:11,419 --> 01:04:13,080
What are his interests now?

816
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:15,683
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

817
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,752
- Where are we going?
- Library.

818
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,875
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--

819
01:04:34,943 --> 01:04:36,433
Discount coupons.

820
01:04:37,346 --> 01:04:42,045
They must have had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

821
01:04:42,117 --> 01:04:45,211
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking...

822
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:46,413
we're dating.

823
01:04:47,055 --> 01:04:48,545
Give me your money.

824
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:54,318
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.

825
01:04:59,201 --> 01:05:00,896
Somerset. How you doing?

826
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,895
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.

827
01:05:03,972 --> 01:05:06,406
It's not a problem. Sit down.

828
01:05:11,713 --> 01:05:14,910
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

829
01:05:14,983 --> 01:05:18,214
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.

830
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:24,921
About an hour.

831
01:05:27,229 --> 01:05:28,925
Yep. Help yourself.

832
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:33,264
That was money well spent.

833
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:35,595
Yeah.

834
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:44,945
Alright.

835
01:05:45,014 --> 01:05:48,780
Telling you this, I'm trusting you
more than I trust most people.

836
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:51,183
Good, 'cause I might punch you.

837
01:05:52,922 --> 01:05:56,858
It's probably nothing, but even so,
it's no skin off our teeth.

838
01:05:59,896 --> 01:06:02,922
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

839
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,029
Who, stinky man?

840
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:11,638
For years, the FBl's been hooked into
the library system, keeping records.

841
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:15,542
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.

842
01:06:15,612 --> 01:06:16,977
Look.

843
01:06:17,046 --> 01:06:18,980
Certain books are flagged.

844
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:21,380
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...

845
01:06:21,784 --> 01:06:23,479
"Mein Kampf".

846
01:06:23,953 --> 01:06:28,822
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
has his library records fed to the FBl.

847
01:06:28,891 --> 01:06:31,155
Wait. How is this legal?

848
01:06:31,227 --> 01:06:34,025
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.

849
01:06:35,498 --> 01:06:39,491
You can't use the information
directly. It's just a useful guide.

850
01:06:39,902 --> 01:06:44,567
It might sound silly, but you can't
get a library card without an ID...

851
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:46,837
and a current phone bill. See?

852
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,547
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.

853
01:06:51,315 --> 01:06:53,579
If you want to know who's reading...

854
01:06:53,651 --> 01:06:57,178
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter"...

855
01:06:57,254 --> 01:06:59,745
the FBl's computers will tell us.

856
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:01,347
It could give us a name.

857
01:07:01,425 --> 01:07:04,519
Of a college kid writing
a term paper...

858
01:07:04,595 --> 01:07:06,187
on 20th-century crime.

859
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:09,196
At least you're out of the office.

860
01:07:09,266 --> 01:07:10,699
Get a haircut.

861
01:07:11,602 --> 01:07:13,035
How do you know this?

862
01:07:13,103 --> 01:07:13,933
I don't.

863
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:16,869
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

864
01:07:24,948 --> 01:07:27,280
"Divine Comedy".

865
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:31,549
"History of Catholicism" A book
called "Murderers and Madmen".

866
01:07:31,622 --> 01:07:35,114
"Modern Homicide lnvestigation".
"ln Cold Blood".

867
01:07:35,693 --> 01:07:37,786
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?

868
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:39,795
It's not what you think.

869
01:07:40,297 --> 01:07:42,288
The Marquis de Sade.

870
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,563
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

871
01:07:44,635 --> 01:07:47,229
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...

872
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:49,397
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.

873
01:07:49,473 --> 01:07:51,840
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

874
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:53,909
Is that it?

875
01:07:53,978 --> 01:07:54,808
Yep.

876
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:58,180
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

877
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,011
Whatever.

878
01:08:00,085 --> 01:08:02,815
We're sure about that name, are we?

879
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:05,253
You were, you saw it. John Doe.

880
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:07,749
You want to go back, I'll go back.

881
01:08:08,226 --> 01:08:10,592
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

882
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,923
This is crazy.

883
01:08:12,997 --> 01:08:15,090
We'll just talk to him.

884
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,926
"Excuse me, sir. Do you
happen to be a serial killer?"

885
01:08:22,507 --> 01:08:23,940
You do the talking.

886
01:08:25,043 --> 01:08:27,603
Put that silver tongue of yours
to work.

887
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,340
You've talked to my wife?

888
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,613
Retarded.

889
01:08:35,019 --> 01:08:37,010
Charlie's fucking Angels.

890
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:39,520
A name off a computer.

891
01:08:43,528 --> 01:08:44,620
Mills.

892
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,303
- You hit?
- No.

893
01:09:00,445 --> 01:09:02,380
He's going down!

894
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:20,488
Fifth floor!

895
01:09:40,653 --> 01:09:43,087
Police. Is there a back way out?

896
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:44,917
Lock your door.

897
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,024
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

898
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:16,881
Get down!

899
01:10:19,092 --> 01:10:20,491
Get the fuck down.

900
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:58,719
Goddamn it.

901
01:13:01,156 --> 01:13:03,454
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.

902
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,325
Where are you going?

903
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:47,828
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.

904
01:14:49,232 --> 01:14:51,393
What? He fucking shot at us.

905
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:52,900
You can't go in.

906
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:55,836
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.

907
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:58,739
Think about it. Think
how did we get here?

908
01:14:58,809 --> 01:15:02,336
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.

909
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:06,178
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?

910
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:10,016
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.

911
01:15:10,087 --> 01:15:12,078
Just pay attention a minute?

912
01:15:12,656 --> 01:15:16,023
With a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

913
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:18,926
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?

914
01:15:18,996 --> 01:15:22,022
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.

915
01:15:22,099 --> 01:15:25,694
We need a reason to knock on
this door.

916
01:15:26,837 --> 01:15:28,270
Think about it.

917
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,932
Okay?

918
01:15:33,777 --> 01:15:34,869
Okay, okay.

919
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:38,370
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

920
01:15:38,448 --> 01:15:40,211
When you're right, you're right.

921
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:49,156
Well...

922
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,051
no point in arguing anymore.

923
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:55,260
Unless you can fix that..

924
01:15:57,801 --> 01:15:59,735
You stupid son of a ...

925
01:16:08,045 --> 01:16:10,139
How much money we got left?

926
01:16:11,015 --> 01:16:12,607
So, yeah, I noticed...

927
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:14,049
this guy going out a lot...

928
01:16:14,118 --> 01:16:17,781
when the murders were happening,
so l...

929
01:16:18,923 --> 01:16:21,289
So you called Det. Somerset?

930
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:23,418
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy...

931
01:16:23,494 --> 01:16:26,429
was creepy and shit,
and one of the murders...

932
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:29,091
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.

933
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,426
Got everything?

934
01:16:31,502 --> 01:16:33,493
Have her sign. You must sign.

935
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:35,561
Good.

936
01:16:36,741 --> 01:16:38,003
You did good.

937
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,777
- I did what you said.
- Here.

938
01:16:40,845 --> 01:16:42,836
You get something to eat.

939
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,347
Everybody stay outside.

940
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,174
Victor.

941
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:05,357
Wild Bill's Leather

942
01:19:43,697 --> 01:19:44,959
Fuck.

943
01:19:54,575 --> 01:19:56,975
LUST

944
01:20:04,452 --> 01:20:05,510
Somerset!

945
01:20:14,795 --> 01:20:16,990
- What?
- We had him.

946
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:19,392
What are you saying?

947
01:20:19,467 --> 01:20:21,492
The fucking photographer in...

948
01:20:21,569 --> 01:20:22,661
the fucking stairs.

949
01:20:27,575 --> 01:20:29,566
We had him and we let him go.

950
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:38,180
You're sure this is him?

951
01:20:38,252 --> 01:20:40,743
Yep. Good. Get it out.

952
01:20:41,422 --> 01:20:45,859
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.

953
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:48,019
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.

954
01:20:48,095 --> 01:20:51,030
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?

955
01:20:51,098 --> 01:20:53,692
We got his money. I like it.

956
01:20:53,768 --> 01:20:56,202
Wait. You won't believe this.

957
01:20:56,271 --> 01:20:59,069
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.

958
01:20:59,141 --> 01:21:02,008
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

959
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:08,373
We could use some more men.

960
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,610
I'm doing my best.

961
01:21:10,452 --> 01:21:13,785
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here...

962
01:21:13,855 --> 01:21:17,120
and each notebook
contains about 250 pages.

963
01:21:17,192 --> 01:21:18,955
What about the killings?

964
01:21:20,195 --> 01:21:24,564
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
what a gross stage we dance on.

965
01:21:24,633 --> 01:21:26,760
What fun, dancing and fucking.

966
01:21:26,835 --> 01:21:30,464
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.

967
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:32,905
We are not what was intended."

968
01:21:32,974 --> 01:21:34,908
Wait, there's a lot more.

969
01:21:36,211 --> 01:21:39,874
"On the subway today, a man came up
to start a conversation.

970
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:44,417
He made small talk, a lonely man
talking about the weather and things.

971
01:21:44,486 --> 01:21:46,647
I tried to be pleasant...

972
01:21:46,721 --> 01:21:49,656
but my head began to hurt
from his banality.

973
01:21:49,724 --> 01:21:51,885
I almost didn't notice...

974
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,326
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

975
01:21:54,896 --> 01:21:56,830
He was not pleased...

976
01:21:57,232 --> 01:21:59,257
and I couldn't stop laughing".

977
01:22:00,669 --> 01:22:02,159
No dates.

978
01:22:02,237 --> 01:22:05,332
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

979
01:22:06,409 --> 01:22:08,400
Just his mind poured out on paper.

980
01:22:09,745 --> 01:22:11,440
Looks like a life's work.

981
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:14,950
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still...

982
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:17,577
- take 2 months.
- I know.

983
01:22:25,361 --> 01:22:27,693
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?

984
01:22:31,267 --> 01:22:32,859
People, quiet!

985
01:22:49,118 --> 01:22:50,551
I admire you.

986
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:54,986
I don't know how you found me,
but I was surprised!

987
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:59,550
I respect you law enforcement
officers more every day.

988
01:22:59,629 --> 01:23:02,223
Well, I appreciate that, John.

989
01:23:02,565 --> 01:23:04,328
- I tell you--
- No, listen:

990
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,666
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's setback.

991
01:23:08,738 --> 01:23:13,732
I just had to call and express my
admiration. Sorry I had to hurt...

992
01:23:13,809 --> 01:23:16,745
one of you, but I had
no choice, right?

993
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:22,014
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to
say more but that'd ruin the surprise.

994
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:30,251
Got it.

995
01:23:34,998 --> 01:23:36,590
Everybody back to work.

996
01:23:38,935 --> 01:23:40,197
You were right.

997
01:23:41,004 --> 01:23:42,164
He's preaching.

998
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:47,008
These murders are his sermons to us.

999
01:23:47,077 --> 01:23:49,944
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.

1000
01:23:53,116 --> 01:23:54,549
Who's the blonde?

1001
01:23:59,156 --> 01:24:00,453
Looks like a pro.

1002
01:24:00,824 --> 01:24:01,791
Maybe.

1003
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:04,226
She caught John Doe's eye.

1004
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:09,124
Wild Bills' Leather

1005
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:13,461
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?

1006
01:24:13,537 --> 01:24:15,232
- Yeah.
- This man?

1007
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:18,297
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1008
01:24:18,375 --> 01:24:22,277
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.

1009
01:24:22,346 --> 01:24:24,439
One sweet piece, actually.

1010
01:24:24,514 --> 01:24:27,245
I thought he was a performance artist.

1011
01:24:27,318 --> 01:24:29,309
You know the sort of guy that...

1012
01:24:29,387 --> 01:24:32,220
pisses in a cup on stage and then...

1013
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,723
drinks it.

1014
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:34,849
Performance art.

1015
01:24:35,193 --> 01:24:36,387
Right.

1016
01:24:39,364 --> 01:24:41,662
I think I undercharged him.

1017
01:24:41,733 --> 01:24:43,928
- You made this for him?
- I've made...

1018
01:24:44,001 --> 01:24:45,901
weirder shit than that.

1019
01:24:51,642 --> 01:24:53,132
They found the blonde.

1020
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:57,814
The picture!

1021
01:24:57,882 --> 01:24:59,281
The picture!

1022
01:25:00,651 --> 01:25:02,380
Fucking pigs.

1023
01:25:04,322 --> 01:25:07,257
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...

1024
01:25:07,325 --> 01:25:09,657
Get the fuck out of the booth.

1025
01:25:09,727 --> 01:25:11,922
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1026
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:14,664
Come on, this way.

1027
01:25:21,672 --> 01:25:25,768
- Can you do something about the music?
- We're looking for the guy.

1028
01:25:38,857 --> 01:25:42,020
You from homicide?
You better see this.

1029
01:25:52,004 --> 01:25:54,029
Get this thing off me.

1030
01:25:54,106 --> 01:25:56,131
Oh God, get it off of me.

1031
01:25:58,377 --> 01:25:59,810
Get him out of here, now!

1032
01:26:01,346 --> 01:26:03,007
I want to hear it again.

1033
01:26:03,348 --> 01:26:04,679
Tell me again.

1034
01:26:07,085 --> 01:26:10,316
You heard nothing strange,
saw nothing strange.

1035
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,627
He asked me if I was married.

1036
01:26:16,695 --> 01:26:19,186
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1037
01:26:19,264 --> 01:26:21,528
The what? What?

1038
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,194
The prostitute. Where was she?

1039
01:26:24,269 --> 01:26:26,760
Someone comes to your establishment...

1040
01:26:26,839 --> 01:26:30,775
they want to go downstairs,
get some oo-la-la. Whatever.

1041
01:26:31,276 --> 01:26:33,437
They got to come to you. Yeah?

1042
01:26:34,112 --> 01:26:35,101
Yeah.

1043
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,511
You didn't see anyone?

1044
01:26:37,349 --> 01:26:40,785
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1045
01:26:40,853 --> 01:26:45,290
Everybody that comes in there's got
to be a package under their arms.

1046
01:26:45,357 --> 01:26:48,884
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1047
01:26:48,961 --> 01:26:50,953
She was just sitting on the bed.

1048
01:26:57,971 --> 01:27:00,565
Who tied her down? You or him?

1049
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:03,074
Do you like what you do for a living?

1050
01:27:03,142 --> 01:27:05,133
All these things you see?

1051
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:08,908
No, I don't.

1052
01:27:10,383 --> 01:27:12,476
But that's life, isn't it?

1053
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:18,916
He had a gun. And...

1054
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:21,585
he made it happen.

1055
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:26,425
He made me do it.

1056
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:29,167
He put that thing on me.

1057
01:27:29,969 --> 01:27:32,665
And he made me wear it.

1058
01:27:32,739 --> 01:27:34,434
Then he...

1059
01:27:34,507 --> 01:27:36,338
told me to fuck her.

1060
01:27:38,177 --> 01:27:40,475
And I did. I fucked her.

1061
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,841
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1062
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,282
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1063
01:27:46,019 --> 01:27:48,681
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1064
01:27:49,088 --> 01:27:50,350
Fuck.

1065
01:27:53,192 --> 01:27:55,353
Oh, God. God.

1066
01:27:55,428 --> 01:27:58,295
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.

1067
01:28:16,884 --> 01:28:18,647
This won't have a happy ending.

1068
01:28:19,787 --> 01:28:22,381
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1069
01:28:25,459 --> 01:28:28,895
If we catch John Doe and he turns out
to be the devil...

1070
01:28:28,963 --> 01:28:30,954
if he's Satan himself...

1071
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:33,329
that might meet our expectations.

1072
01:28:33,968 --> 01:28:35,458
But he's not the devil.

1073
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:38,565
He's just a man.

1074
01:28:39,139 --> 01:28:40,231
You know...

1075
01:28:40,975 --> 01:28:44,741
You bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.

1076
01:28:45,579 --> 01:28:48,742
If you think you're preparing me
for hard time...

1077
01:28:48,816 --> 01:28:49,840
thanks, but...

1078
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:52,681
But you got to be a hero.

1079
01:28:53,654 --> 01:28:55,417
You want to be a champion.

1080
01:28:55,489 --> 01:28:58,583
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...

1081
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:01,924
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?

1082
01:29:01,996 --> 01:29:03,429
I want to know.

1083
01:29:08,102 --> 01:29:10,798
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.

1084
01:29:12,107 --> 01:29:13,734
Go on.

1085
01:29:16,611 --> 01:29:19,944
I don't think I can continue to live
in a place...

1086
01:29:20,015 --> 01:29:23,781
that embraces and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1087
01:29:23,852 --> 01:29:25,843
You aren't different or better.

1088
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,616
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1089
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:31,955
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1090
01:29:32,027 --> 01:29:33,961
Apathy is a solution.

1091
01:29:34,496 --> 01:29:40,401
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1092
01:29:40,468 --> 01:29:44,404
It's easier to steal what you want
than to earn it. It's easier...

1093
01:29:44,472 --> 01:29:49,068
to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.

1094
01:29:49,144 --> 01:29:54,241
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.

1095
01:29:54,315 --> 01:29:55,907
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1096
01:29:55,984 --> 01:29:59,476
No, we're talking about
everyday life here.

1097
01:29:59,554 --> 01:30:02,819
You can't afford to be this naive.

1098
01:30:02,891 --> 01:30:04,654
Fuck off.

1099
01:30:04,726 --> 01:30:06,250
See, you...

1100
01:30:06,327 --> 01:30:08,261
You should listen to yourself.

1101
01:30:08,329 --> 01:30:10,422
Yeah. You say that...

1102
01:30:10,498 --> 01:30:12,989
the problem is people don't care.

1103
01:30:13,835 --> 01:30:15,928
So, I don't care about people.

1104
01:30:16,004 --> 01:30:17,835
Nonsense. You know why?

1105
01:30:17,906 --> 01:30:19,339
You care?

1106
01:30:19,407 --> 01:30:21,272
Want to know-- Damn right.

1107
01:30:21,342 --> 01:30:22,934
You'll make a difference.

1108
01:30:23,012 --> 01:30:25,503
Whatever. The point is that...

1109
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:28,516
you're not quitting
because you believe...

1110
01:30:28,584 --> 01:30:30,518
these things you say.

1111
01:30:30,586 --> 01:30:32,281
You want to believe them...

1112
01:30:32,354 --> 01:30:33,787
because you're quitting.

1113
01:30:35,524 --> 01:30:40,461
And you want me to agree with you and
say "You're right, it's all fucked up.

1114
01:30:40,529 --> 01:30:44,693
It's a fucking mess. We should all go
live in a fucking log cabin."

1115
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:47,034
But I won't.

1116
01:30:47,803 --> 01:30:49,703
I won't say that.

1117
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,308
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1118
01:30:57,213 --> 01:30:58,043
I can't.

1119
01:31:08,457 --> 01:31:09,981
I'm going home.

1120
01:31:18,134 --> 01:31:19,328
Thank you, though.

1121
01:31:49,933 --> 01:31:51,764
I love you.

1122
01:31:52,335 --> 01:31:53,859
So much.

1123
01:32:02,012 --> 01:32:03,274
I know.

1124
01:33:03,507 --> 01:33:03,541
SUNDAY

1125
01:33:03,541 --> 01:33:05,771
SUNDAY

1126
01:33:05,843 --> 01:33:08,038
What's your emergency?

1127
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:10,704
Could you repeat that?

1128
01:33:11,949 --> 01:33:13,610
I've done it again.

1129
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:23,219
PRIDE

1130
01:33:23,794 --> 01:33:25,227
What have we got?

1131
01:33:25,296 --> 01:33:27,287
Sleeping pills.

1132
01:33:28,466 --> 01:33:30,229
Glued to one hand.

1133
01:33:30,301 --> 01:33:31,791
Telephone glued to the other.

1134
01:33:33,504 --> 01:33:34,766
You see what he did?

1135
01:33:35,706 --> 01:33:37,264
He sliced her up.

1136
01:33:37,642 --> 01:33:39,576
Then he bandaged her.

1137
01:33:39,644 --> 01:33:41,908
Call for help and you'll live.

1138
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:43,810
But you'll be disfigured.

1139
01:33:45,783 --> 01:33:48,308
Or put yourself out
of your own misery.

1140
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,582
Come on.

1141
01:33:50,655 --> 01:33:52,088
He cut off her nose.

1142
01:33:52,156 --> 01:33:53,919
To spite her face.

1143
01:33:53,991 --> 01:33:56,084
And he did it very recently.

1144
01:34:03,568 --> 01:34:04,660
Listen...

1145
01:34:05,671 --> 01:34:08,663
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1146
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:12,608
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe...

1147
01:34:12,678 --> 01:34:15,772
or he'll kill 7 and this case
will never end.

1148
01:34:15,847 --> 01:34:19,180
Don't do me any favors. Thank you,
but I got it.

1149
01:34:19,251 --> 01:34:24,120
I'm asking to be your partner a few
more days. You'd be doing me a favor.

1150
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:37,295
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.

1151
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:41,467
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.

1152
01:34:44,276 --> 01:34:45,470
Detective?

1153
01:34:47,112 --> 01:34:48,807
After this I'm gone.

1154
01:34:49,614 --> 01:34:52,344
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1155
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:56,710
You're looking for me.

1156
01:34:59,524 --> 01:35:00,616
Don't fucking move.

1157
01:35:00,692 --> 01:35:02,023
On the floor.

1158
01:35:02,094 --> 01:35:04,221
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.

1159
01:35:04,296 --> 01:35:05,490
I know you.

1160
01:35:05,564 --> 01:35:06,895
Now. Get down.

1161
01:35:07,466 --> 01:35:09,094
Get down on your stomach.

1162
01:35:09,168 --> 01:35:10,601
You piece of shit. Now!

1163
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,033
All the way. All the way...

1164
01:35:13,106 --> 01:35:14,596
fucker. Down.

1165
01:35:14,674 --> 01:35:16,039
Faster.

1166
01:35:16,109 --> 01:35:18,270
Faster, fucker. Now.

1167
01:35:18,344 --> 01:35:20,107
Nose on the ground.

1168
01:35:23,349 --> 01:35:26,443
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1169
01:35:26,519 --> 01:35:29,682
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1170
01:35:31,391 --> 01:35:32,722
Goddamn it.

1171
01:35:34,961 --> 01:35:39,557
He cuts the skin off the tips of his
fingers. That's why we couldn't...

1172
01:35:39,632 --> 01:35:41,793
find 1 print in his apartment.

1173
01:35:41,868 --> 01:35:44,132
Seems he's done that for a while.

1174
01:35:44,203 --> 01:35:46,797
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?

1175
01:35:46,873 --> 01:35:48,966
So far everything is a dead end.

1176
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:51,806
No credit history.
No employment records.

1177
01:35:51,878 --> 01:35:55,075
A 5-year old bank account
opened with cash.

1178
01:35:55,148 --> 01:35:57,480
We've tried tracing his furniture.

1179
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,245
All we know about him...

1180
01:35:59,318 --> 01:36:01,809
is that he's independently wealthy...

1181
01:36:02,388 --> 01:36:03,753
well-educated...

1182
01:36:03,823 --> 01:36:05,256
and totally insane.

1183
01:36:05,324 --> 01:36:07,758
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1184
01:36:08,361 --> 01:36:12,320
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.

1185
01:36:12,398 --> 01:36:16,596
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.

1186
01:36:16,669 --> 01:36:17,829
There he sits.

1187
01:36:17,904 --> 01:36:20,271
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1188
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,602
He's not finished.

1189
01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:24,769
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1190
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:27,437
You know what I'm saying.

1191
01:36:27,514 --> 01:36:31,507
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1192
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:33,109
He wouldn't just stop.

1193
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:35,178
So what the fuck, man?

1194
01:36:35,255 --> 01:36:38,850
He's 2 murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1195
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:41,792
We'll wait for his plea.

1196
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:45,332
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1197
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:49,860
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1198
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:54,965
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them...

1199
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:57,135
and only at 6 o'clock today.

1200
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:58,337
Why us?

1201
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,641
He says he admires you.

1202
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:03,812
It's part of the game.

1203
01:37:03,884 --> 01:37:08,150
If they don't accept this offer,
these bodies will never be found.

1204
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,850
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1205
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:13,659
We've got him.

1206
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:16,662
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1207
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:19,221
He'll get his free room and board,
cable TV.

1208
01:37:19,299 --> 01:37:23,326
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?

1209
01:37:23,403 --> 01:37:27,737
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit...

1210
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:32,178
and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.

1211
01:37:32,247 --> 01:37:33,475
I don't like it.

1212
01:37:33,548 --> 01:37:35,482
The law requires me to serve...

1213
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:39,077
my clients and their interests
as best I can.

1214
01:37:39,154 --> 01:37:41,349
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1215
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:42,912
My client informs you that...

1216
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:45,687
if you do not accept,
he'll plead insanity.

1217
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:48,027
Let him try it.

1218
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:49,924
I'd like to see it.

1219
01:37:49,998 --> 01:37:53,934
We know with the extreme nature
of these crimes I'd get him off...

1220
01:37:54,002 --> 01:37:55,435
with such a plea.

1221
01:37:55,503 --> 01:37:58,063
I won't let this conviction slide.

1222
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:02,098
If you do accept under
his specific conditions, he'll sign...

1223
01:38:02,177 --> 01:38:04,941
a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1224
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:07,576
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1225
01:38:09,184 --> 01:38:10,776
Full confession.

1226
01:38:10,852 --> 01:38:12,046
I'm in.

1227
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,951
It must be both of you.

1228
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:17,554
If he were to claim insanity...

1229
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:20,458
this conversation is admissible.

1230
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:22,955
That he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1231
01:38:23,031 --> 01:38:26,057
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.

1232
01:38:26,134 --> 01:38:29,626
The press'd love to find out
the police weren't concerned...

1233
01:38:29,704 --> 01:38:32,070
about finding and burying them.

1234
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:34,301
If in fact there are 2 more dead.

1235
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,036
The lab report came.

1236
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:38,806
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.

1237
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,408
They found blood from Doe's fingers,
blood from...

1238
01:38:42,484 --> 01:38:45,920
the woman who's face he cut off,
and blood from...

1239
01:38:45,988 --> 01:38:47,580
a third party...

1240
01:38:47,656 --> 01:38:49,487
as yet unidentified.

1241
01:38:52,895 --> 01:38:55,261
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1242
01:38:58,167 --> 01:38:59,794
Let's finish it.

1243
01:39:03,505 --> 01:39:06,531
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO flies out...

1244
01:39:06,609 --> 01:39:08,941
I want you to expect it.

1245
01:39:10,846 --> 01:39:12,108
I will.

1246
01:39:14,917 --> 01:39:19,786
If I accidently shaved off a nipple,
would it be covered by workman's comp?

1247
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,793
I suppose so.

1248
01:39:27,429 --> 01:39:30,296
If you were man enough
to file a claim...

1249
01:39:30,366 --> 01:39:33,164
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1250
01:39:34,203 --> 01:39:37,400
I keep coming home late,
my wife'll think something's up.

1251
01:39:46,448 --> 01:39:47,472
You know...

1252
01:39:48,951 --> 01:39:49,975
Yeah.

1253
01:39:56,059 --> 01:39:57,048
What?

1254
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:08,961
Will this wind hurt us?

1255
01:41:58,249 --> 01:41:59,477
Who are you, John?

1256
01:42:00,418 --> 01:42:01,851
Who are you really?

1257
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,853
What do you mean?

1258
01:42:03,921 --> 01:42:07,823
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us about yourself?

1259
01:42:07,892 --> 01:42:11,521
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1260
01:42:11,595 --> 01:42:13,426
Stay on your left up here.

1261
01:42:17,436 --> 01:42:18,630
Where are we heading?

1262
01:42:19,871 --> 01:42:21,099
You'll see.

1263
01:42:21,706 --> 01:42:24,971
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?

1264
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:27,874
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1265
01:42:27,946 --> 01:42:30,710
You've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1266
01:42:32,017 --> 01:42:34,383
Wanting people to listen...

1267
01:42:34,453 --> 01:42:35,715
you can't just...

1268
01:42:35,787 --> 01:42:38,221
tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1269
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:40,781
You have to use a sledgehammer.

1270
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:43,794
Then you'll get
their strict attention.

1271
01:42:43,862 --> 01:42:45,454
But the question is:

1272
01:42:45,931 --> 01:42:48,729
Why're you so special
that people should listen?

1273
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,290
I'm not special.

1274
01:42:51,303 --> 01:42:53,396
I've never been exceptional.

1275
01:42:54,039 --> 01:42:56,803
This is, though. What I'm doing.

1276
01:42:56,875 --> 01:42:58,035
My work.

1277
01:42:58,109 --> 01:42:59,770
Your work, John?

1278
01:42:59,845 --> 01:43:01,039
Yes.

1279
01:43:01,546 --> 01:43:04,538
See, I don't see anything special
about it, John.

1280
01:43:05,717 --> 01:43:07,116
That's not true.

1281
01:43:07,185 --> 01:43:10,985
No, it is true. And the funny
thing is, all this work...

1282
01:43:11,389 --> 01:43:15,883
in 2 months, no one'll care,
or give a shit, or even remember.

1283
01:43:16,495 --> 01:43:18,986
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1284
01:43:19,998 --> 01:43:21,761
But when this is done...

1285
01:43:23,001 --> 01:43:24,468
when it's finished...

1286
01:43:26,072 --> 01:43:27,801
it's going to be...

1287
01:43:30,676 --> 01:43:33,611
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1288
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,344
But they won't be able to deny.

1289
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:39,445
Could the freak be more vague?

1290
01:43:40,419 --> 01:43:42,080
As far as master plans go...

1291
01:43:42,755 --> 01:43:45,019
I really can't wait for you to see.

1292
01:43:45,091 --> 01:43:46,854
It's going to be something.

1293
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:50,693
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.

1294
01:43:50,763 --> 01:43:54,028
So when this thing happens,
be sure and let me know.

1295
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,567
Don't want to miss it.

1296
01:43:55,635 --> 01:43:57,296
Oh, don't worry.

1297
01:43:57,703 --> 01:43:58,965
You won't.

1298
01:44:00,873 --> 01:44:02,807
You won't miss a thing.

1299
01:44:29,569 --> 01:44:31,059
What's so exciting?

1300
01:44:32,138 --> 01:44:34,265
It's not too far now.

1301
01:44:41,481 --> 01:44:46,009
I've tried to figure something in my
head. Maybe you can help me out.

1302
01:44:47,788 --> 01:44:51,724
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are, do you know...

1303
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:53,683
that you're insane?

1304
01:44:54,428 --> 01:44:56,328
Maybe you're reading...

1305
01:44:56,396 --> 01:44:58,523
masturbating in your own feces...

1306
01:44:58,599 --> 01:45:00,590
Do you just stop and go:

1307
01:45:00,667 --> 01:45:04,262
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1308
01:45:04,338 --> 01:45:07,034
You know? Do you guys do that?

1309
01:45:07,441 --> 01:45:10,433
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1310
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:11,772
It's very comfortable.

1311
01:45:12,446 --> 01:45:15,609
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1312
01:45:16,116 --> 01:45:19,210
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1313
01:45:19,286 --> 01:45:20,446
Whatever.

1314
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,784
I don't doubt that you believe that.

1315
01:45:23,523 --> 01:45:25,548
but it seems that you're...

1316
01:45:25,626 --> 01:45:27,719
overlooking a contradiction.

1317
01:45:27,794 --> 01:45:29,193
Meaning what?

1318
01:45:30,197 --> 01:45:31,789
Glad you asked.

1319
01:45:33,467 --> 01:45:35,230
If you were chosen...

1320
01:45:35,302 --> 01:45:37,736
that is, by a higher...

1321
01:45:37,804 --> 01:45:39,738
power...

1322
01:45:39,806 --> 01:45:41,899
and if your hand was forced...

1323
01:45:42,309 --> 01:45:45,642
it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment.

1324
01:45:46,046 --> 01:45:48,572
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1325
01:45:49,651 --> 01:45:52,814
That doesn't seem to fit
with martyrdom, does it?

1326
01:45:54,322 --> 01:45:55,482
John?

1327
01:46:00,395 --> 01:46:05,162
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me...

1328
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:06,928
in a room without windows.

1329
01:46:07,802 --> 01:46:09,167
Isn't that true?

1330
01:46:09,737 --> 01:46:11,170
How'd you like to...

1331
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:14,265
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.

1332
01:46:14,342 --> 01:46:16,105
I would never.

1333
01:46:16,177 --> 01:46:18,941
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1334
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:23,107
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1335
01:46:23,184 --> 01:46:25,846
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1336
01:46:26,421 --> 01:46:29,288
I won't deny my own personal desire...

1337
01:46:29,357 --> 01:46:31,518
to turn each sin against
the sinner.

1338
01:46:32,093 --> 01:46:35,790
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1339
01:46:37,765 --> 01:46:40,461
Innocent? ls that supposed
to be funny?

1340
01:46:41,202 --> 01:46:42,863
An obese man.

1341
01:46:42,937 --> 01:46:45,462
Disgusting man who could barely stand.

1342
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:50,034
You'd point him out to your friends
so that they'd join you in mocking him.

1343
01:46:50,111 --> 01:46:54,548
If you saw him while you ate,
you couldn't finish your meal.

1344
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:58,844
Then the lawyer. You had to
secretly thank me for that.

1345
01:46:59,221 --> 01:47:02,315
This is a man who dedicated
his life...

1346
01:47:02,391 --> 01:47:07,158
to making money by lying with every
breath he could muster to keep...

1347
01:47:07,229 --> 01:47:09,163
murderers and rapists...

1348
01:47:09,231 --> 01:47:10,892
- on the streets.
- Murderers?

1349
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,030
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman...

1350
01:47:14,103 --> 01:47:17,004
so ugly inside that she
couldn't go on living...

1351
01:47:17,072 --> 01:47:19,404
if she couldn't be beautiful outside?

1352
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:23,844
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget...

1353
01:47:23,912 --> 01:47:26,710
the disease-spreading whore.

1354
01:47:28,951 --> 01:47:31,419
Only in a world this shitty...

1355
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:35,321
could you say they were innocent
and keep a straight face.

1356
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:40,022
But that's the point.

1357
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:44,593
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1358
01:47:44,666 --> 01:47:46,190
in every home and we...

1359
01:47:46,668 --> 01:47:47,600
tolerate it.

1360
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,934
We tolerate it because it's common.

1361
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:52,439
It's trivial.

1362
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:55,602
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1363
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:00,709
Well, not anymore.

1364
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:05,050
I'm setting the example.

1365
01:48:06,622 --> 01:48:08,385
And what I've done will be...

1366
01:48:08,457 --> 01:48:09,788
puzzled over...

1367
01:48:10,293 --> 01:48:11,783
and studied...

1368
01:48:12,962 --> 01:48:14,395
and followed...

1369
01:48:16,199 --> 01:48:17,393
forever.

1370
01:48:18,134 --> 01:48:19,396
Yeah.

1371
01:48:20,637 --> 01:48:21,865
Delusions of grandeur.

1372
01:48:23,973 --> 01:48:25,736
You should be thanking me.

1373
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:27,574
Why's that, John?

1374
01:48:27,644 --> 01:48:30,807
Because you'll be remembered
after this.

1375
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,816
Realize, Detective, the only reason
that I'm here now...

1376
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:36,977
is that I wanted to be.

1377
01:48:37,053 --> 01:48:39,749
No. We would have got you eventually.

1378
01:48:39,823 --> 01:48:41,256
Oh, really?

1379
01:48:41,324 --> 01:48:45,556
So what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

1380
01:48:46,062 --> 01:48:49,156
Allowing 5 "innocent" people
to die until...

1381
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:51,666
you felt like springing your trap?

1382
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:53,668
What was the indisputable...

1383
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:56,762
evidence you were going to use on me,
right before...

1384
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,503
I walked up to you and put my hands
in the air?

1385
01:49:00,577 --> 01:49:02,772
John. Calm down.

1386
01:49:02,846 --> 01:49:05,337
I remember us knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:06,249 --> 01:49:07,614
That's right.

1388
01:49:07,684 --> 01:49:11,017
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:49:15,525 --> 01:49:18,085
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1390
01:49:18,161 --> 01:49:19,856
Okay. Sit back.

1391
01:49:19,929 --> 01:49:21,955
- I spared you.
- Sit back.

1392
01:49:22,032 --> 01:49:24,523
Remember that when you
look in the mirror...

1393
01:49:24,602 --> 01:49:26,797
for the rest of your life...

1394
01:49:26,871 --> 01:49:30,363
or should I say for the rest
of what life I allow you...

1395
01:49:30,441 --> 01:49:31,806
to have.

1396
01:49:31,876 --> 01:49:33,810
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1397
01:49:33,878 --> 01:49:35,436
Shut your fucking mouth!

1398
01:49:36,947 --> 01:49:41,384
You're no messiah. You're a movie
of the week. A fucking tee-shirt...

1399
01:49:41,785 --> 01:49:43,309
at best.

1400
01:49:56,567 --> 01:49:58,899
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1401
01:49:58,969 --> 01:50:03,338
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:03,407 --> 01:50:08,003
Is that to say, John, that what
you were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:11,248 --> 01:50:14,012
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1404
01:50:16,253 --> 01:50:18,687
Do you see those high tension towers?

1405
01:50:18,756 --> 01:50:20,587
That's where we're headed.

1406
01:50:20,658 --> 01:50:23,252
I see it. 9 o'clock,
and follow that road.

1407
01:50:37,442 --> 01:50:40,275
There sure as shit is no ambush
out here.

1408
01:50:40,345 --> 01:50:42,438
No fucking nothing out here.

1409
01:50:43,281 --> 01:50:46,444
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.

1410
01:50:46,518 --> 01:50:48,611
I want you to go way up.

1411
01:50:48,687 --> 01:50:52,054
In thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.

1412
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:54,952
I'll get him.

1413
01:52:01,861 --> 01:52:03,021
Get out.

1414
01:52:03,929 --> 01:52:05,191
Slowly.

1415
01:52:05,931 --> 01:52:07,125
Stop.

1416
01:52:07,933 --> 01:52:09,195
Stay.

1417
01:52:12,371 --> 01:52:13,633
What do you got?

1418
01:52:15,207 --> 01:52:16,469
A dead dog.

1419
01:52:18,210 --> 01:52:19,939
I didn't do that.

1420
01:52:26,619 --> 01:52:27,813
What time is it?

1421
01:52:28,621 --> 01:52:29,485
Why?

1422
01:52:29,889 --> 01:52:31,288
I'd like to know.

1423
01:52:34,627 --> 01:52:35,719
7:01.

1424
01:52:38,964 --> 01:52:40,124
It's close.

1425
01:52:41,067 --> 01:52:42,329
Let's go take a look.

1426
01:52:45,971 --> 01:52:47,165
It's this way.

1427
01:53:35,622 --> 01:53:37,886
Down. Down. Down.

1428
01:53:39,626 --> 01:53:40,786
Watch him.

1429
01:53:42,362 --> 01:53:43,420
There he goes.

1430
01:53:44,531 --> 01:53:46,692
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1431
01:53:52,839 --> 01:53:55,774
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.

1432
01:54:03,383 --> 01:54:04,907
A van's coming down the road.

1433
01:54:05,318 --> 01:54:06,411
From the north.

1434
01:54:15,796 --> 01:54:19,755
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.

1435
01:54:25,573 --> 01:54:26,597
Get out!

1436
01:54:29,243 --> 01:54:30,267
Out!

1437
01:54:30,344 --> 01:54:32,505
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.

1438
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:33,842
Step away.

1439
01:54:34,582 --> 01:54:36,573
Turn around. Hands on your head.

1440
01:54:37,185 --> 01:54:38,413
What's going on?

1441
01:54:39,353 --> 01:54:40,513
Why are you here?

1442
01:54:40,588 --> 01:54:44,524
I'm delivering a package
for this guy, David.

1443
01:54:44,592 --> 01:54:45,957
Detective...

1444
01:54:46,027 --> 01:54:47,289
David Mills.

1445
01:54:54,435 --> 01:54:56,369
Get it. Slowly.

1446
01:55:09,016 --> 01:55:11,712
A guy paid me $500
to bring it out here.

1447
01:55:11,786 --> 01:55:13,981
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.

1448
01:55:14,555 --> 01:55:15,817
Put it down.

1449
01:55:16,958 --> 01:55:18,324
We got a box.

1450
01:55:18,393 --> 01:55:20,987
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.

1451
01:55:21,063 --> 01:55:22,690
Bomb squad. We got a box.

1452
01:55:22,764 --> 01:55:24,322
Face the van.

1453
01:55:25,067 --> 01:55:26,227
Hands up.

1454
01:55:33,976 --> 01:55:34,840
Turn.

1455
01:55:36,511 --> 01:55:37,842
Okay. Go.

1456
01:55:37,913 --> 01:55:39,403
Off you go. Go.

1457
01:55:41,617 --> 01:55:43,710
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1458
01:55:47,356 --> 01:55:48,789
He's headed north, along the road.

1459
01:55:48,857 --> 01:55:50,119
Have him picked up.

1460
01:55:59,801 --> 01:56:01,393
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

1461
01:56:07,976 --> 01:56:09,466
I'm going to open it.

1462
01:56:09,544 --> 01:56:12,741
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1463
01:56:32,201 --> 01:56:33,259
It's blood.

1464
01:56:33,336 --> 01:56:35,930
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.

1465
01:56:36,005 --> 01:56:39,600
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1466
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:08,794
California, stay away from here.

1467
01:57:08,871 --> 01:57:11,465
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.

1468
01:57:11,541 --> 01:57:13,600
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1469
01:57:14,544 --> 01:57:16,637
John Doe has the upper hand.

1470
01:57:18,214 --> 01:57:19,545
Here he comes.

1471
01:57:19,615 --> 01:57:21,549
- Throw your gun down!
- What?

1472
01:57:21,617 --> 01:57:23,812
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.

1473
01:57:23,886 --> 01:57:25,080
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1474
01:57:26,622 --> 01:57:28,453
Do you hear me, Detective?

1475
01:57:28,524 --> 01:57:30,185
I'm trying to tell you how much...

1476
01:57:30,259 --> 01:57:32,750
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1477
01:57:33,696 --> 01:57:34,856
What?

1478
01:57:34,931 --> 01:57:36,125
Tracy.

1479
01:57:37,033 --> 01:57:39,628
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing...

1480
01:57:39,703 --> 01:57:42,638
how easily a member of the press
can purchase...

1481
01:57:42,706 --> 01:57:44,640
information from the men
in your precinct.

1482
01:57:44,708 --> 01:57:46,539
What the fuck?

1483
01:57:46,610 --> 01:57:48,805
Throw your gun down!

1484
01:57:48,879 --> 01:57:50,870
I visited your home this morning...

1485
01:57:51,715 --> 01:57:53,376
after you left.

1486
01:57:54,218 --> 01:57:56,015
I tried to play husband.

1487
01:57:56,553 --> 01:58:00,148
I tried to taste the life
of a simple man.

1488
01:58:00,224 --> 01:58:01,486
Throw it away!

1489
01:58:01,558 --> 01:58:03,719
It didn't work out.

1490
01:58:03,794 --> 01:58:05,557
So...

1491
01:58:05,629 --> 01:58:07,563
I took a souvenir.

1492
01:58:09,233 --> 01:58:11,133
Her pretty head.

1493
01:58:15,973 --> 01:58:18,498
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.

1494
01:58:18,575 --> 01:58:19,837
What's goin' on over there?

1495
01:58:19,910 --> 01:58:21,935
Would you... Put the gun down.

1496
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:23,411
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?

1497
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:25,345
Because I envy your normal life.

1498
01:58:25,416 --> 01:58:26,576
Put the gun down, David.

1499
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:28,515
It seems that envy is my sin.

1500
01:58:28,585 --> 01:58:30,519
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.

1501
01:58:30,587 --> 01:58:32,020
What's in the fucking box?

1502
01:58:32,423 --> 01:58:34,084
He just told you.

1503
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:37,321
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!

1504
01:58:37,661 --> 01:58:40,824
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.

1505
01:58:44,902 --> 01:58:46,335
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.

1506
01:58:46,403 --> 01:58:48,598
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.

1507
01:58:48,672 --> 01:58:49,934
She's all right. You tell me.

1508
01:58:50,007 --> 01:58:51,202
Become...

1509
01:58:51,276 --> 01:58:52,368
wrath.

1510
01:58:52,444 --> 01:58:53,604
Tell me she's all right!

1511
01:58:54,179 --> 01:58:55,703
If you murder a suspect, David...

1512
01:58:57,015 --> 01:58:59,108
you just throw it all away
and he knows it.

1513
01:58:59,751 --> 01:59:01,878
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!

1514
01:59:01,953 --> 01:59:04,217
She begged for her life...

1515
01:59:04,289 --> 01:59:06,280
and for the life of the baby
inside of her.

1516
01:59:24,809 --> 01:59:26,140
He didn't know.

1517
01:59:39,991 --> 01:59:41,652
Give me the gun, David.

1518
01:59:49,667 --> 01:59:51,259
If you kill him...

1519
01:59:52,737 --> 01:59:54,102
he will win.

1520
01:59:58,409 --> 02:00:00,274
Oh God!

1521
02:00:00,345 --> 02:00:01,779
Oh God!

1522
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:12,842
Well, we'll take care of him.

1523
02:01:22,095 --> 02:01:23,858
Whatever he needs.

1524
02:01:24,998 --> 02:01:26,556
Where you gonna be?

1525
02:01:29,269 --> 02:01:30,531
Around.

1526
02:01:35,008 --> 02:01:36,441
I'll be around.

1527
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:43,112
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1528
02:01:43,183 --> 02:01:46,880
The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

1529
02:01:48,455 --> 02:01:50,548
I agree with the second part.
