1
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,398
You see how it's done?

2
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,994
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.

3
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,631
You better. The boss will chew my head
off if these cores get messed up.

4
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,392
Don't worry.

5
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,910
We're at 26 feet.

6
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,752
You let Jason operate the drill?

7
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,911
Yeah, he can handle it.

8
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,596
I didn't do anything.

9
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,752
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!

10
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,759
Forget it, Jack! It's too late!

11
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,714
You're not gonna make it!

12
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,594
Jack!

13
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,359
Jack! Give me your hand!

14
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,356
I've got you!

15
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,319
What were you thinking?

16
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,392
- What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!

17
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,676
That's what's happening!

18
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,629
We found evidence of a cataclysmic
climate shift 10,000 years ago.

19
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,669
The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores. . .

20
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,037
. . .indicates that runaway warming
pushed Earth into an ice age. . .

21
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,395
. . .which lasted two centuries.

22
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,477
I'm confused.

23
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,474
I thought you were talking about
global warming, not an ice age.

24
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,993
Yes, it is a paradox. . .

25
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,751
. . .but global warming can trigger
a cooling trend. Let me explain.

26
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,751
The Northern Hemisphere owes its
climate to the North Atlantic Current.

27
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,959
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

28
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,513
But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.

29
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,116
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs. . .

30
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,077
. . .there goes our warm climate.

31
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,792
Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?

32
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,748
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years,
maybe in 1000. But what I do know is. . .

33
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,276
. . .that if we do not act soon,
our children and grandchildren. . .

34
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,032
. . .will have to pay the price.

35
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,558
And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?

36
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,395
It would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

37
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,110
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President. . .

38
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
. . .the cost of doing nothing
could be even higher.

39
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,232
Our climate is fragile.

40
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,437
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment. . .

41
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,750
. . .the ice caps will soon disappear.

42
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,117
Professor Hall. . .

43
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,238
. . .our economy is every bit as fragile
as the environment.

44
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,234
Perhaps you should keep that in mind
before making sensationalist claims.

45
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,791
Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off. . .

46
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,030
. . .was about the size of Rhode Island.

47
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,873
Some people might call that
pretty sensational.

48
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,271
Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!

49
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,474
I'm at the Global Warming Conference
in New Delhi. . .

50
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,074
. . .where, if you can believe it,
it's snowing.

51
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,676
The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos. . .

52
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,479
. . .with numbers of homeless people
freezing to death.

53
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,073
Taxi!

54
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,755
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.

55
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,276
Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?

56
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,159
Quite. I was wondering
if I could talk to you. . .

57
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,118
. . .about your theory
on abrupt climate shift.

58
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,430
The name's Rapson. Terry Rapson.

59
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,070
Professor Rapson?
Of the Hedland Center?

60
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,312
- That's me.
- I've read your work on ocean currents.

61
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,951
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.

62
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,438
Over here.

63
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,278
Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland,
where Manchester United...

64
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,954
...leads 3- 1 over hometown Celtic.

65
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,755
We return 63 minutes into
the second half as Manchester United...

66
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,674
...looks to put the game out of reach.
Let's get back to our commentator...

67
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,592
...Donald MacFarland.

68
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,030
What? Yeah.

69
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,873
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.

70
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,349
The baby kept us awake all night.

71
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,193
- And still.
- Yeah!

72
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,352
Dennis? NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing
a temperature drop of 13 degrees.

73
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,871
- Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's. . . .

74
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,593
- Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.

75
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,352
Must have knocked it about.

76
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,434
Kick that bloody ball. Come on!

77
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,989
Come on, kick it now. Kick it!

78
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,912
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?

79
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,759
Hello, professor. How was India?

80
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,354
Oh, you know what these
scientific gatherings are.

81
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,353
All dancing girls, wine and parties.

82
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,235
The fury of Hurricane Noelani
stunned weather experts yesterday...

83
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,311
...slamming into the island chain...

84
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,233
... with a cataclysmic force
never before witnessed.

85
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,552
Meteorologists already believe this to be
the strongest hurricane ever recorded....

86
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,039
Are you gonna get that?

87
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,270
It will surely leave a wake of death....

88
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,718
- Hello?
- I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.

89
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,031
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.

90
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,158
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.

91
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,311
I don't have time to talk about this now.

92
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,199
Well, maybe you ought to make time.

93
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,234
Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away
for months and months at a time.

94
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,038
I just don 't understand.

95
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,755
I'll let him explain it. Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?

96
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,194
Sam's getting on a plane?

97
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,555
He joined
the Scholastic Decathlon Team.

98
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,157
- They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?

99
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,875
- Yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.

100
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,712
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?

101
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,110
I gotta go because I'm on call tonight.

102
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,874
Don't be late. I don't want
him taking a taxi again.

103
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,999
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.

104
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,188
This morning's weather staff meeting
has been moved to level four, room B.

105
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,718
Jack?

106
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,000
I know you're good at rubbing people
the wrong way. . .

107
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,232
. . .but why would you aggravate
the vice president?

108
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,233
Because my 17-year-old kid
knows more science than he does.

109
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,960
Your 17-year-old kid
does not control our budget.

110
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,588
- Who cares if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.

111
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,637
If Raymond Becker pulls our budget--

112
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,952
- Oh, shit!
- Wait-- Will you--? Jack.

113
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,510
Oh, my God.

114
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, the cab's already here.

115
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,911
That's okay. I'll take care of it.

116
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,354
- What are--?
- Here you go.

117
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,837
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

118
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,072
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- How can there be two sides?

119
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,835
I got every question right on the final.
Mr. Spengler failed me. . .

120
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,389
- . . .because I didn't write the solutions.
- Why not?

121
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,036
I do them in my head.

122
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,873
- Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.

123
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,713
He said if he can't do them in his head,
I'm cheating.

124
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,118
Ridiculous. How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?

125
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,715
That's what I said.

126
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,559
You did?

127
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,629
- How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?

128
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,751
Oh, yeah.

129
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,632
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.

130
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,636
I'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.

131
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,074
We'll straighten this out.

132
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,832
Hey, you can't park there.

133
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,150
- Don't worry about it.
- Sam?

134
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,278
Sam.

135
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,069
Parker, this is Houston.

136
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,879
We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.

137
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,554
It doesn 't look like you're coming back
this week.

138
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,676
Your wife's gonna give me an earful.

139
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,432
Roger that.

140
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,593
Hey, come take a look
at this storm system. It's enormous.

141
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,352
You all right?

142
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,671
He's afraid of flying.

143
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,512
I'm fine.

144
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,869
Statistically, the chance of a plane
going down because of turbulence. . .

145
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,397
. . .is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?

146
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,629
- I can't remember if it's a--
- Shut up, Brian.

147
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,153
Listen, Sam. . .

148
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,118
. . .don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.

149
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,953
They're still serving drinks.

150
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,839
It appears we're gonna have a bit of
a bumpy ride for the next few minutes.

151
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,958
Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables...

152
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,398
...and seats in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.

153
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,388
Whoa!

154
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,471
Grab it. Watch out!

155
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,519
Sam?

156
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,392
Sam.

157
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,158
Can I have my hand back?

158
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,190
I can't believe I'll be alone
with my mom.

159
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,432
Be patient with her. She's been
looking forward to this holiday.

160
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,999
I know.

161
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,157
I love you.

162
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,234
I love you too.

163
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,599
Hey.

164
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,956
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.

165
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,918
The cause of this extreme weather
remains a mystery...

166
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,516
...although some meteorologists
believe sunspots are to blame.

167
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,910
- Hundreds are missing....
- This is very odd.

168
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,470
There's a buoy registering
a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.

169
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,633
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.

170
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,553
I'll see if there are ships near
Georges Bank to get it.

171
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,712
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.

172
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,199
What?

173
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,395
- What are the odds of two buoys failing?
- Remote.

174
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,872
Make that three.

175
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,949
Just another typical day in New York
City. Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.

176
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,148
Look here, Buddha. These people,
and their cars, and their exhaust. . .

177
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,276
. . .and they're polluting the atmosphere.

178
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,910
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.

179
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,196
We're almost there.

180
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,353
- We're only two blocks away.
- Let's walk.

181
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,472
What's gotten into them?

182
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,952
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.

183
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,278
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro. . .

184
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,598
. . .defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.

185
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,559
What is his name? Time.

186
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,033
Montezuma.

187
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,794
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.

188
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,793
It's, like, Anta-something.

189
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,471
- Atahualpa?
- That's it!

190
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,392
Time's up. Correct answers, please.

191
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,798
That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.

192
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,239
Next question.

193
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,716
In what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?

194
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,392
This place is so retro, it might actually
be cool if it were on purpose.

195
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,110
Yeah, look at all these nerds.

196
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,838
Hey.

197
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,199
Hey.

198
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,751
You look beautiful.

199
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,470
Thanks. This place is incredible.

200
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,551
Do you believe this is their cafeteria?

201
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,438
You played a great first round.

202
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,478
So did you.

203
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,279
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.

204
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,431
- I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.

205
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,239
- Your school's amazing.
- Would you like a tour?

206
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,274
Sure. That'd be great.

207
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,317
Could you hold this for a sec?

208
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,110
Yeah, sure.

209
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,713
Thanks.

210
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,835
Man, you got some serious competition.

211
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,231
Please.

212
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,915
- And I'll bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.

213
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,917
- Who is it?
- Terry Rapson here.

214
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,479
Sorry to call you so early.

215
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,676
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?

216
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,710
Well, we've found
something extraordinary.

217
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,916
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.

218
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,436
You recall what you said in New Delhi
about how polar melting. . .

219
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,830
. . .might disrupt
the North Atlantic Current?

220
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,592
Yes.

221
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,439
Well. . .

222
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,913
. . .I think it's happening.

223
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,434
What do you mean?

224
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,479
One of our NOMAD buoys registered
a 13-degree drop...

225
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,473
...in surface temperature.
I've sent you an e-mail.

226
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,392
Hold on.

227
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,989
At first we thought it was a malfunction.

228
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,073
But there are four more across the
North Atlantic showing the same thing.

229
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,310
This is unbelievable.

230
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,678
You predicted it would happen.

231
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,389
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.

232
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,836
There are no forecast models
remotely capable. . .

233
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,197
. . .of plotting this scenario, except yours.

234
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,397
My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.

235
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,551
It's not a forecast model.

236
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,870
It's the closest thing we have.

237
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,559
Nothing like this has ever
happened before.

238
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,832
At least not in the last 10,000 years.

239
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:42,357
As I predicted yesterday, the swell
off Hurricane Noelani is incredible.

240
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,718
These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.

241
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,030
Shouldn't you be monitoring
the weather?

242
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,714
This is L.A. What weather?

243
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,200
Wait. What's that noise?

244
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,157
What noise?

245
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,909
Honey, I'll be right back.

246
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,708
The Coast Guard closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for....

247
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,632
- L.A. Weather Center.
- It's Tommy.

248
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,519
I'm in the middle of something, Tommy.
What do you need?

249
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,792
There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.

250
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,394
A low-pressure system along
the California coast...

251
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,199
...is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.

252
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,510
- Yeah?
- Boss, turn on The Weather Channel.

253
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,910
I think we have to issue
a tornado warning.

254
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,513
What are you talking about?

255
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,278
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess....

256
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,591
- Hold on a second.
- Conditions highly unusual for California.

257
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,308
We're building a forecast model,
we need-- What?

258
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,552
Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.

259
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,439
- Is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.

260
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,431
I'd say you've lost your mind. . .

261
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,194
. . .but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.

262
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,713
Tom, this is important.

263
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,917
What is this forecast model
you're building?

264
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,517
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall. Janet's
a hurricane specialist with NASA.

265
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,151
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have
absolutely no idea what he's up to.

266
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,120
Booker. What's going on here?

267
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,033
They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.

268
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,112
Breaking news as we prepare to go live
to Los Angeles.

269
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,068
Mixed reports are coming in about some
extreme weather occurring in the area.

270
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,710
Okay, we're now going live
to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.

271
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,358
We have live coverage now from
our Fox 11 chopper. Are you there, Bart?

272
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,671
Yes, I'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast--

273
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,798
- Bart!
- What? Oh! Oh, my God.

274
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,269
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?

275
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,829
This tornado just erased
the Hollywood sign.

276
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,151
The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.

277
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,471
Bart, what can you see? Is anyone hurt?

278
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,438
I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage.

279
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,234
And there are people down there
taking pictures.

280
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,278
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!

281
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,829
You can't stay here! Get out of here!

282
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,555
What you're seeing are
two actual tornados. . .

283
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,109
. . .striking Los Angeles
International Airport.

284
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,397
Wait. It looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.

285
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,118
- Tommy!
- Oh, my God!

286
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,191
Holy shit!

287
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,468
I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away....

288
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,916
- Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on Yucca and Vine.

289
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,072
- I'm on my way.
- You're on TV. You're in the middle of it.

290
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,630
God! Oh, my God!

291
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,431
You gotta get out of there, man.

292
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,154
That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche!

293
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,470
Oh, my God.
I hope no one was in that car.

294
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,029
For our national audience
just joining us now...

295
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,590
... we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now. Tommy?

296
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,558
If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.

297
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,075
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.

298
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,199
It's one of many tornados
that are destroying our city.

299
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,477
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.

300
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,155
It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.

301
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,434
What's happening?

302
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,353
It looks like some sort of. . .

303
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,389
. . .huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing.

304
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,636
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

305
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,832
- Yes, it is.
- What's happening?

306
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,399
I'll call you back.

307
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,353
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.

308
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,835
On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.

309
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,037
- What do you think we should do?
- Until we can figure it out. . .

310
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,270
. . .I don't think we have
much choice, sir.

311
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,876
What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.

312
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,508
Hey, man, I just got off the phone
with my mom.

313
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,468
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.

314
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,118
The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.

315
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,033
Unfortunately, the order came too late
for two planes...

316
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,078
...brought down by severe turbulence
in the Midwest.

317
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,073
- The first flight....
- So much for ""one in a billion. ""

318
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,597
All right. All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.

319
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,718
We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time. . .

320
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,316
. . .so let's get started, please. Vorsteen?

321
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,518
All our grid models are worthless.

322
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,513
I don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.

323
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,991
Canadians report tremendous circulation
moving from the Arctic.

324
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,232
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system
never before seen.

325
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,233
And Australia just saw
the strongest typhoon ever recorded.

326
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,836
- These things are interconnected?
- We have to consider the possibility.

327
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,788
The only force strong enough to affect
global weather is the sun.

328
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,549
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.

329
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,438
Solar output is normal.

330
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,593
- What about the North Atlantic Current?
- What about it?

331
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,599
I got a call last night from
Professor Rapson at the Hedland Center.

332
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,990
He thinks the current has changed.

333
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,271
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?

334
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,638
The current depends upon a balance
of salt and freshwater.

335
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,030
- We all know that.
- Yes. . .

336
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,430
. . .but no one knows
how much freshwater. . .

337
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,639
. . .has been dumped into the ocean
because of melting polar ice.

338
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,589
I think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.

339
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,160
It would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.

340
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,993
Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.

341
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,515
They've asked me to feed it
into my paleoclimate model. . .

342
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,159
. . .to track the next events.

343
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,517
Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?

344
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,514
Not just continue. Get worse.

345
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,234
I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

346
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,030
What are you gonna tell
the Administration?

347
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,031
What do you expect me to tell them?

348
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,270
The government has
to make preparations.

349
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,273
- You have a theory.
- Give me the mainframe. I'll prove it.

350
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,237
No.

351
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,831
You have 48 hours.

352
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,273
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.

353
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,238
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.

354
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,710
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

355
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,474
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.

356
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,154
Can your model factor in
storm scenarios?

357
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,437
- We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.

358
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,192
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

359
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,316
Hi, I'm Jason.

360
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,596
- Hi.
- Hi.

361
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,357
Do you have Peter's CT scan results?

362
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,988
Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20 percent.

363
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,833
- Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.

364
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,069
- Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.

365
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,798
Good.

366
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,431
Let me listen here.

367
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,914
Can you read that?

368
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,312
No, but I remember the story
from the pictures.

369
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,914
You do?

370
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,116
My mother used to read it to me.

371
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,439
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.

372
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,993
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

373
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,359
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

374
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,956
Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.

375
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,759
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.

376
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,514
Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes
for a while.

377
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,751
Call me when you get the results.

378
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,911
Frank, is he always so obsessive?

379
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,957
- Yeah.
- Yes.

380
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,353
Does he ever lighten up?

381
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,112
- Not really.
- No.

382
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,789
How long have you been working
together?

383
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,951
Well, Frank's been working with him. . .

384
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,069
. . .since the Stone Age, but I've only
had to endure two years of servitude.

385
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,873
Jack.

386
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,996
Jack, we got the results.

387
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,310
Six to eight months? That can't be.

388
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,959
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.

389
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,513
Widespread flooding has caused
numerous closures...

390
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,989
...including the Lincoln
and Holland Tunnels.

391
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,396
The plumbing in the school
is really old.

392
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,790
With this rain,
the sewage got stopped up.

393
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,393
Where are you staying?

394
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,949
They're finding a place for us
with kids here.

395
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,509
You can't get home any sooner
than tomorrow?

396
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,475
Well, look, Dad, I would if I could,
you know. It's just. . . .

397
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,350
This smell is unbearable, Dad.

398
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,431
Stop kidding around! I want you home.

399
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,192
Dad, I'll be on the train.

400
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,352
Do me a favor. Just don't worry
about me. I'll figure it out.

401
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,397
All right, son. I'll see you tomorrow.

402
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,310
Hey, Sam, guess what?

403
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,590
We got a place to stay.

404
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,834
Great.

405
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,434
So far, the terrible weather
hasn 't hit D. C...

406
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,114
...but local residents
aren 't taking chances...

407
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,750
...as people stock up for what is already
being billed as...

408
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,309
- ... the worst storm season on record.
- Better be sure.

409
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,516
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.

410
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,955
And I hope to God it's wrong.

411
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,998
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.

412
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.

413
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,997
Professor Hall has some information
I think you should look at.

414
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,879
We just got these results
from our simulation model.

415
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,110
They explain what's causing
this weather.

416
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,953
I'll read it later. I have to meet
with the director of FEMA--

417
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,394
This is very urgent.

418
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,758
Our climate is changing violently. It will
happen over the next six to eight weeks.

419
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,388
You said this wouldn't happen
for another 100 years.

420
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,120
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.

421
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,317
I wish I were, but you're aware
of what's happening everywhere.

422
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,233
We're making all the necessary
preparations for this storm.

423
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,674
What more do you expect?

424
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,549
You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.

425
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,358
Especially in the Northern states.

426
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,033
- Evacuations?
- Yes.

427
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,510
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.

428
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,553
Mr. Vice President! If we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.

429
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,277
Come on, Jack.

430
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,591
- Thanks for bringing us here.
- I couldn't let you leave New York. . .

431
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,069
. . .without seeing
the Natural History Museum.

432
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,959
Of course not. It's a fine collection
of stuffed animals.

433
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,394
Hey, guys, check this out.

434
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,711
""The body of this mammoth
was found. . .

435
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,348
. . .perfectly preserved
in the Siberian tundra. . .

436
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,834
. . .with food still in its mouth
and stomach. . .

437
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,950
. . .indicating that it froze instantly
while grazing. ""

438
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,753
It's been 24 hours now since the snow
started falling across the British Isles...

439
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,878
...and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.

440
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,713
No, no, no.
You've got to stop worrying. No, no.

441
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,509
It's fine. We've got plenty of supplies.
We're just snowed in.

442
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,189
Yeah. No, it's all right. It's all right.

443
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,316
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.

444
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,239
Yeah, I love you too. Okay, bye.

445
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,308
- Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.

446
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,357
The ferry just landed.

447
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,431
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.

448
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,990
An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter...

449
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,720
... to airlift the royal family to safety.

450
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,555
- Yeah, you think they'll come get us?
- Not likely.

451
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,512
Luckily we've got our own genny,
enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.

452
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,557
Oh, we'll be fine.

453
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,109
As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.

454
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,559
In Ireland, those remaining
in Belfast and Bambridge...

455
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,872
...have been urged to evacuate
to Dublin as soon as possible.

456
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,349
The north continues to receive
the worst of the storm...

457
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,829
...and conditions in the south
are expected to worsen.

458
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,518
We've got zero visibility.
Maintain heading and speed.

459
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,875
- What's our heading?
- 035, sir.

460
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,838
Approximately 40 kilometers
from Balmoral Castle.

461
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,514
We've lost visual contact with you.

462
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,312
- This gauge can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.

463
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,313
We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.

464
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,953
What the hell is going on?

465
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,396
The bloody fuel lines
are starting to freeze.

466
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,435
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.

467
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,637
We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.

468
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,951
Prepare for crash landing.

469
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,829
Select emergency fuel.

470
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,430
Come on, you bastard!

471
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,712
Come on!

472
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,753
What I'm about to say
is supposed to be confidential.

473
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,515
Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.

474
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,956
They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.

475
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,839
- At what temperature does--?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

476
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,228
We had to look it up.

477
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,834
The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.

478
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,515
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

479
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,513
Can you get a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?

480
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,750
We've got mountains of data. . .

481
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,549
. . .but nowhere near enough computer
power to analyze it. Can you help us?

482
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,831
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.

483
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,878
Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.

484
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,156
This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.

485
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,710
This thing looks just like a hurricane.

486
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,713
Only hurricanes don't form over land.

487
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,189
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.

488
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,999
- Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.

489
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,991
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.

490
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,913
Wow.

491
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,993
You live here?

492
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,912
Just on the weekends.

493
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,674
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so. . . .

494
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,159
Where is he?

495
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,357
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.

496
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,712
Is this you and your brother?

497
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,872
Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.

498
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,071
It's been raining like this
for three days now.

499
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,555
Come on, hurry up.

500
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,159
I'm just standing here.

501
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,068
You can't stay here.

502
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,391
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.

503
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,028
It's a mob scene here
at Grand Central Station.

504
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,149
Over half the platforms are flooded and
service has been suspended on all trains.

505
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,312
With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service...

506
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,118
... that's bad news for the....

507
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,239
Victor's coming to pick me up. You
guys want a ride to the train station?

508
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,594
Not anymore.

509
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,959
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.

510
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,590
What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.

511
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,751
The cold front moving from the Arctic...

512
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,480
...has created an enormous
storm system in Canada...

513
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,315
... which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more like a tropical hurricane....

514
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,677
I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want a ride?

515
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,957
- Where is he?
- He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.

516
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,553
If this system moves south...

517
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,995
... we could see
a wind-driven storm surge...

518
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,674
... threaten the entire
Eastern Seaboard.

519
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,194
Okay, bye.

520
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,794
Victor's stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.

521
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,997
It'll be easier to head out of town
if we meet him over there.

522
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,879
You mean walk?
No, not in this.

523
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,272
We should take the stairs.

524
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,954
We're on the top floor.

525
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,398
I guess we're walking.

526
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,831
Maybe we should just stay here.

527
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,513
I think the young lady is right.

528
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,309
No. We need to get home.

529
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,797
Hey, Cesar, come here.

530
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,958
What are you doing?

531
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,434
The wolves, they're gone.

532
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,716
Just to give you an idea
of the situation...

533
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,872
... which seems to be becoming worse
with each passing minute:

534
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,476
At the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.

535
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,837
We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out...

536
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,390
... to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.

537
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,790
Car accidents, at least 200.

538
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,192
And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.

539
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,794
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?

540
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,678
Hey.

541
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,633
That dog can't come in here.

542
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,189
Come on, man. It's pouring out there.

543
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,476
I don't care. Read the sign.

544
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,033
It's supposed to be a public library.

545
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,996
Come on, guys, this way.

546
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,118
Excuse me. Your bad.

547
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,431
Goddamn 1500-dollar
waterproof raincoat.

548
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,398
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.

549
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,993
That's because it's New York.

550
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,720
Hey! Hey!

551
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,554
- Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.

552
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,758
It's out of service.

553
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,673
- I'll give you $ 100.
- You don't have to do that.

554
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,400
No, really. $200.
I won't have it.

555
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,757
God, I love buses. This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.

556
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,868
Hello?

557
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,600
- I can't reach my driver. No signal.
- This is insane.

558
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,320
We're not gonna be able to drive.
We should go back.

559
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,756
- Yeah, I vote for that.
- Are you kidding? We have to get higher!

560
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,513
Come on.

561
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,796
Up to the library.

562
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,474
Calm down.

563
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,871
I can't understand what you're saying.

564
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,948
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.

565
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,550
The door is jammed!

566
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,834
I don't speak French!

567
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,188
Hey, where's Laura?

568
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,153
- She was just right there.
- She's right there! Right there, see?

569
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,719
What is she doing?

570
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,474
Tell them to cover their eyes.

571
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:15,197
There is a wall of water coming towards
New York City. Everybody--

572
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,275
- What?
- Her bag's in the cab. Their passports.

573
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,396
Forget about it.

574
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,630
- I'll get it for her.
- Come on.

575
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,154
Oh, my. . . .

576
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,071
Laura!

577
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,232
Laura!

578
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,031
- Sam.
- No! Brian, no!

579
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,316
Laura! Laura, look!

580
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,072
Come on. Come!

581
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,353
Come on!

582
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,079
Sam!

583
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,793
Professor.

584
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,113
Thank you.

585
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,637
- Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.

586
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,518
- He's 6 already.
- Oh.

587
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,558
No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.

588
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,757
God. I can't believe Neville's 6 already.

589
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,271
You won't believe how fast they grow.

590
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,272
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.

591
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,750
They've run the data we've sent them.

592
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,713
Here he is.

593
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,750
Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?

594
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,717
Yes. The storm's rotation. . .

595
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,873
. . .is pulling super-cooled air all the way
down from the upper troposphere.

596
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,634
But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?

597
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,918
It should. But it doesn 't.
The air's descending too rapidly.

598
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,314
Is this an isolated incident?

599
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,557
I'm afraid not.

600
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,951
We've located two supercells
in addition to the one over Scotland.

601
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,678
One over Northern Canada. . .

602
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,718
...and another one over Siberia.

603
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,440
And do we know their projected paths?

604
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,828
Yes.

605
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,117
Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren 't even close.

606
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,670
This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.

607
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,549
Here's a projection of 24 hours out.

608
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,275
This is 48 hours out.

609
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,718
And in seven to 10 days....

610
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,875
When this storm is over...

611
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,713
... we'll be in a new ice age.

612
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,397
My God.

613
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,711
Professor. . .

614
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,791
. . .it's time you got out of there.

615
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,757
I'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.

616
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,795
What can we do?

617
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,269
Save as many as you can.

618
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,239
Jack. . .

619
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,516
. . .something's happened in New York.

620
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,399
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.

621
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,518
- Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.

622
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,592
What?

623
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,557
This is the last one. Enjoy it.

624
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,199
Greedy.

625
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,635
All circuits are busy at this time.

626
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,711
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.

627
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,078
It was really brave.

628
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,949
I guess I better return her bag.

629
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,839
Sam?

630
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,311
Just tell her how you feel.

631
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,593
Yeah.

632
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,035
- Did you reach your little brother yet?
- No, there's still no service.

633
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,156
Damn cell phones.

634
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,357
Excuse me. Are there any
pay phones on the upper floors?

635
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,033
No, no, no.

636
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,156
- There are some on the mezzanine.
- Great.

637
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,232
- But I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.

638
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,789
Older payphones draw power
directly from the line.

639
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,316
There will be an emergency meeting
of all NO AA department heads....

640
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,833
Oh, God. I've been trying to reach Sam.

641
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,638
So have I.

642
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,157
I tried to call
and couldn't get you.

643
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,231
It's been a madhouse here. Come on.

644
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,796
Are you sure about this?

645
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,708
It works.

646
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,353
I love that picture.

647
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,590
Yeah, so do I.

648
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,834
Where was that taken?

649
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,274
Miami.

650
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,995
Well, where was I?
I don't remember that trip.

651
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,833
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska. . .

652
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,753
. . .doing research on your doctorate.

653
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,273
Remember what he was like
when he was that age?

654
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,876
Everything was ""one more. ""

655
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,750
One more bedtime story. One more ride
on my shoulders. ""One more, Daddy. ""

656
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,593
Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four.

657
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,239
- Sam?
- Dad!

658
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,632
- Where are you? Are you all right?
- I'm all right. We're at the Public Library.

659
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,553
- It's Mom. I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.

660
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,716
Can you call Laura and Brian's parents
and tell them we're all right?

661
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,313
Yes, of course.

662
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,590
- Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?

663
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,718
Sam?

664
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,308
What is going on out there, Dad?

665
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,516
Sam. Sam, listen to me.

666
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,079
Listen very carefully.

667
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,231
Forget what I said about heading south.

668
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,516
It's too late.
The storm is gonna get worse.

669
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:40,075
It'll turn into a massive blizzard with an
eye in the center like a huge hurricane.

670
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,512
Only the air will be so cold,
you could freeze to death in seconds.

671
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,394
Sam?

672
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,028
- Well, what should we do?
- Listen to me, son.

673
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,112
Do not go outside.

674
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,113
Burn what you can to stay warm,
and try to wait it out.

675
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,114
I will come for you. Do you
understand me? I will come for you.

676
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,314
Sam?

677
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,349
- Sam, come back!
- Sam?

678
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,877
Sam, did you hear me?

679
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,234
Did you hear me?

680
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,159
Sam?

681
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,068
- Tell me he's gonna be okay--
- He's gonna be all right.

682
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,196
He's gonna be all right,
you understand?

683
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,713
I thought you'd drowned.

684
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,916
Let's find some dry clothes for you.
Come on.

685
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,358
Where'd you store the arctic gear?

686
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,192
You can't make it to New York, Jack.

687
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,590
I've walked that far before in the snow.

688
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,078
This is not the same.

689
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,313
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.

690
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,670
I have to do this.

691
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,671
I know.

692
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,076
My hands are shak--

693
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,550
- Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.

694
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,597
Here. Come here.

695
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,912
What are you doing?

696
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,469
I'm using my body heat to warm you.

697
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,109
If we let the blood
from your arms and legs. . .

698
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,635
. . .rush back to your heart
too quickly. . .

699
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,234
. . .your heart could fail.

700
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,429
Where did you learn that?

701
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,189
Some of us were actually
paying attention in health class.

702
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,397
How are you feeling?

703
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,432
Much better.

704
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,395
Frank told me about Sam.

705
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,553
I won't try to talk you out of going,
but there's something I need first.

706
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,393
You have to explain your results
to the Administration.

707
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,313
- I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. It'll be different.

708
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,030
You're gonna brief the president directly.

709
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,591
- Is that the last of it?
- Pretty much.

710
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,273
Okay.

711
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,352
We also found this radio,
but I don't think it works.

712
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,398
Let me see it.

713
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,358
Buddha, keep quiet.

714
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,114
You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.

715
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,753
Come on, guys.

716
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,272
Oh, my God.

717
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,236
The basic rule of storms
is they continue. . .

718
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,597
. . .until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.

719
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,399
In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

720
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,318
This superstorm will last
seven to 10 days.

721
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,349
When it's over, ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

722
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,988
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.

723
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,196
The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize. . .

724
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,511
. . .with an average temperature
close to that of the last Ice Age.

725
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,637
Well, what can we do about this?

726
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,951
Head as far south as possible.

727
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,193
That is not amusing, professor.

728
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,516
Where do you suggest they go?

729
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,035
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

730
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,671
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't
flooded. Mexico would be best.

731
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,276
Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.

732
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,919
Well, we tried that approach.

733
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,392
You didn't wanna hear about the science
when it could have made a difference.

734
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,711
What exactly are you proposing,
professor?

735
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,875
Evacuate everyone south of that line.

736
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,551
What about the people in the North?

737
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,075
I'm afraid it's too late for them.

738
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,310
If they go outside. . .

739
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,357
. . .the storm will kill them.

740
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,238
At this point. . .

741
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,919
. . .their best chance is to stay inside.

742
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,030
Try to ride it out.

743
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,159
Pray.

744
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,519
What do you think he'll do?

745
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,432
I don't know.

746
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,874
Jack. . .

747
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,073
. . .thanks. . .

748
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,559
. . .and good luck.

749
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,358
You too.

750
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,351
We're all gonna need it.

751
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,751
We can't evacuate half the country. . .

752
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,798
. . .because one scientist thinks
the climate is shifting.

753
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,635
- Every minute we delay costs lives.
- And the other half of the country?

754
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,995
If Professor Hall is right
about this storm. . .

755
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,469
. . .sending troops north will
create more victims.

756
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,949
We need to save the people
we can right now.

757
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,078
We take the same approach in triage
on the battlefield.

758
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,118
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices--

759
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,078
I don't accept abandoning
half the country is necessary.

760
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,470
Maybe if you listened sooner,
it wouldn't be.

761
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,949
Bullshit. It's easy for him
to suggest this plan.

762
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,317
- He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.

763
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,956
I thought you should know before
you start questioning his motives.

764
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,032
We're going to follow Hall's plan.

765
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,679
- General.
- Sir?

766
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,037
Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate Southern states.

767
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,758
Yes, sir.

768
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,193
Vivian. . .

769
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,112
. . .get me my wife.

770
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,630
Sorry, mates,
but we're just about out of petrol.

771
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,159
Hey.

772
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,193
Is there any chance. . .

773
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,193
. . .that it'll run. . .

774
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,231
. . .on this?

775
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,913
Are you mad?

776
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,355
That's a 12-year-old Scotch.

777
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,468
Gentlemen.

778
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,430
To England.

779
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,077
To mankind.

780
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,837
To Manchester United.

781
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,588
I just. . . .

782
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,548
I just wish I could have seen
him grow up. You know?

783
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,799
The important thing is he will grow up.

784
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,318
Amen.

785
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,839
Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that.

786
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,113
Sir, I am president
of the Electronics Club. . .

787
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,475
. . .the Math Club and the Chess Club.

788
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,552
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here,
please, point him out.

789
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,673
I'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?

790
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,792
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.

791
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,633
Look, there's nobody around.

792
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,553
You know what? I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.

793
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,192
What?

794
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,352
Hey, man, there's people out there.

795
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,028
I was walking my dog.

796
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,079
There's hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.

797
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,199
Where they all going?

798
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,113
They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.

799
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,993
All right, everybody. Quiet down.

800
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,993
When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?

801
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,628
I got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.

802
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,597
They're being evacuated to the South.

803
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,239
We should get moving too.

804
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,914
The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.

805
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,197
We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.

806
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,830
Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.

807
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,353
We shouldn't go.

808
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,317
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.

809
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,074
When I talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.

810
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,912
The storm will kill anybody in it.

811
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,719
- Then you have to say something.
- I know.

812
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,074
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.

813
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,073
What? Listen, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.

814
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,753
- That's not it.
- Get ready to go.

815
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,230
If these people go outside,
they will freeze to death!

816
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,752
Okay, what is this nonsense?

817
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,435
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.

818
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,955
The people caught outside
will freeze to death.

819
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,714
- Where are you getting this?
- My dad's a climatologist.

820
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,440
- He works for the government.
- So, what do we do?

821
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,160
We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.

822
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,390
The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.

823
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,994
We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies. . . .

824
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,196
- It's a risk, yeah--
- An unnecessary risk.

825
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,554
No, no. It's not.

826
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,029
We've wasted enough time talking.
Come on.

827
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,474
Let's go.

828
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,837
- Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody--

829
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,310
This storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.

830
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,516
You're not gonna be able to survive it.

831
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,994
Believe me.

832
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,278
Sir, please just stay. Just stay.

833
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,150
Just don't. . . .

834
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,077
She's set to go.
Come on, straight to the back, guys.

835
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,196
It'll be impossible to reach each other.

836
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,920
Leave a message for me
at the embassy in Mexico City.

837
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,274
Okay, I will.

838
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,273
I love you.

839
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,795
I love you, Jack.

840
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,398
Tell Sam I love him so much.

841
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,671
God be with you.

842
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,516
- Dr. Hall?
- Yeah.

843
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,955
We haven't been able
to reach Peter's parents.

844
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,556
- I'm gonna try later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

845
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,392
I got it.

846
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,880
You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.

847
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,352
I've been watching your back for 20
years. You think I'd let you go alone?

848
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,592
And all these years I thought
I was watching your back.

849
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,478
Where are the keys?

850
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,312
In the truck.

851
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,155
Where do you think you're going?

852
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,675
Neither one of you can navigate
worth a damn.

853
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,751
Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.

854
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,957
I'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.

855
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,311
Good luck, Jack.

856
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,114
Breaking news from
the U.S.-Mexico border.

857
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,477
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border. . .

858
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,155
. . .in the light of so many U.S. refugees
who are fleeing south. . .

859
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,470
. . .in the wake of the approaching storm.

860
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,518
These people came in anticipation
of crossing into Mexico.

861
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,796
Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.

862
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,111
And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration...

863
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,716
. . .thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.

864
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,395
The scene unfolding here behind me
is one of desperation and frustration.

865
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,916
People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings...

866
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:38,471
...and they are wading across the river
illegally into Mexico.

867
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,358
Here it is.

868
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,031
This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 100 years.

869
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,232
All right.

870
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,159
- What are you doing?
- What did you think we would burn?

871
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,512
- You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.

872
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,398
You want to freeze to death?

873
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,351
I'll go get some more.

874
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,919
I'll help you.

875
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,396
I'm going with them.

876
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,995
Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?

877
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,879
Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.

878
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,948
We're not gonna last long
on M&M's and potato chips.

879
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,156
What about the garbage cans?

880
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,788
There's always something
to eat in the garbage.

881
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,280
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can't burn Nietzsche.

882
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,318
He was the most important thinker
of the 19th century.

883
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,313
Please. He was a chauvinist pig
in love with his sister.

884
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,073
He was not a chauvinist pig.

885
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,471
But he was in love with his sister.

886
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,232
Excuse me? You guys?

887
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,393
Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law
down here that we can burn.

888
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,791
After hours of uncertainty,
the traffic is now moving smoothly...

889
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,076
...from the United States into Mexico.

890
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,949
This is only possible because the
president was able to negotiate a deal...

891
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:12,318
... to forgive all Latin American debt
in exchange for opening the border.

892
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,473
Now, multitudes of American families
are feeling a rush of relief....

893
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,638
Lucy?

894
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,753
Is Peter's ambulance here?

895
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,512
No.

896
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,875
- Why?
- They've all gone.

897
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,519
- What?
- In the confusion. . .

898
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,229
. . .I don't know what happened.
People started to panic, and they left. . . .

899
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,595
- God.
- There's a policeman with a snowplow.

900
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,069
- He's waiting outside.
- God.

901
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,629
Peter can't be moved in anything
but an ambulance.

902
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,478
I called and left a message
for the county ambulance service.

903
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,319
Okay.

904
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,795
Okay, you should go,
and I'll stay and wait.

905
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,548
Lucy, no.

906
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,472
- No.
- No, you should go.

907
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,471
He's not gonna wait forever.

908
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,471
It's okay.

909
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,791
I'm sorry.

910
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,358
- It's okay.
- All right.

911
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,078
You all right?

912
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,118
Yeah, I'm fine. I just--
I cut my leg the other day.

913
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,308
Did you get a signal?

914
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,516
Yeah, for a minute.

915
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,908
And?

916
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,836
Man, this storm is everywhere.

917
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,275
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.

918
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,428
Europe is buried under
15 feet of snow. . .

919
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,194
. . .and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.

920
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,399
I mean, I don't think your dad's
gonna make it.

921
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,638
No, he'll make it.

922
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,957
He'll make it.

923
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,079
The White House has ordered
a national disaster alert...

924
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,559
...for all Northern states.

925
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,359
Continued exposure to
the approaching storm is deadly.

926
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,354
Remain indoors and take all measures to
stay warm, burning any fuel sources...

927
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,069
...until the storm is over. Roads are
impassable across New York State...

928
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,435
...as far south as Pennsylvania....

929
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,477
Where are we?

930
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,153
Looks like we're just north
of Philadelphia.

931
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,872
Look out!

932
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,712
You guys okay?

933
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,199
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

934
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,878
- Once again, roads across the....
- Sorry, boss.

935
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,075
Unpack the snowshoes.

936
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,117
We're walking from here.

937
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,319
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.

938
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,989
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.

939
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,630
Why? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.

940
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,279
Time to get up and keep moving.

941
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,159
What we should've done
is stayed in the library.

942
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,314
Okay, guys, let's get moving.

943
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,357
Wake up.

944
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,639
What are you doing?

945
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,472
Insulating.

946
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,995
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.

947
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,989
You know, you spend some years on the
streets and you learn how to keep warm.

948
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,752
Hey.

949
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,512
Thanks.

950
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,997
I got one.

951
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,151
Your favorite vacation.

952
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,671
Besides this one?

953
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,828
All right.

954
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,073
I went to Greenland with my dad on one
of his research trips a few years ago. . .

955
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,677
. . .and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.

956
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,154
And it rained constantly.

957
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,155
That sounds really boring.

958
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,669
But actually really nice, you know?

959
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,116
Just me and my dad
hanging out for 10 days.

960
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,392
Frank!

961
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,318
Are you all right?

962
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,674
I'm fine.

963
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,920
I just dropped in to do a little shopping.

964
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,713
I gotta lose this sled.

965
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,039
Hold on! We'll pull you up.

966
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,238
Jason! You've got to support
Frank's weight.

967
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,039
Okay, I'll try.

968
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,674
Okay, I think I have his weight now.

969
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,512
I'm coming to you.

970
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,188
The glass is breaking!

971
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,679
Too much weight.

972
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,919
It's not gonna hold.

973
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,514
No. No.

974
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,718
Frank. I can get you out.

975
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,393
Don't do it!

976
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,869
- No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!

977
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,277
Frank!

978
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,831
What have you got there?

979
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,989
A Gutenberg Bible.

980
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,395
It was in the rare books room.

981
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,278
You think God's gonna save you?

982
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,673
No. I don't believe in God.

983
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,880
You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.

984
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,951
I'm protecting it.

985
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,676
This Bible is the first book ever printed.

986
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:13,235
It represents the dawn
of the age of reason.

987
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,434
As far as I'm concerned, the written
word is mankind's greatest achievement.

988
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,273
You can laugh.

989
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,192
But if Western civilization is finished. . .

990
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,674
. . .I'm gonna save
at Ieast one IittIe piece of it.

991
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,950
We heard somebody was left behind.

992
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,389
- We brought an ambulance.
- Thank God.

993
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,399
Thank you so much for coming.

994
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,919
Hey.

995
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,870
Hey, are you all right?

996
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,196
You look like you have a fever
or something.

997
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,352
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.

998
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:53,439
My mind keeps going over
all those worthless decathlon facts.

999
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,195
- It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.

1000
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,716
I guess you just haven't had time
to adjust yet.

1001
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,914
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?

1002
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,228
Everything I've ever cared about,
everything I've worked for. . .

1003
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,230
. . .has all been preparation
for a future that no longer exists.

1004
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,439
I know you always thought I took
the competition too seriously.

1005
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,432
You were right.

1006
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,878
- It was all for nothing.
- No, no. I--

1007
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,833
No, I just-- I just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.

1008
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,792
Truth about what?

1009
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,911
About why I joined the team.

1010
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,910
I joined it because of you.

1011
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,873
Hey.

1012
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,272
I know.

1013
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,759
I know.

1014
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,956
- Mr. President.
- All right.

1015
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,909
I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.

1016
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,391
We're the last ones.

1017
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,753
All right.

1018
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,832
Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.

1019
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,277
We've got an urgent message
for high command.

1020
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,556
Request priority for landing zone one.

1021
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,508
Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.

1022
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,679
- Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.

1023
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,956
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.

1024
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,997
Madam Secretary.

1025
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,718
Raymond.

1026
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,029
The president's motorcade
got caught in the storm.

1027
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,438
They didn't make it.

1028
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,954
And she wouldn't wake up
this morning. I--

1029
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,475
She only had a fever.
I don't understand.

1030
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,710
She's awfully pale.

1031
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,275
None of us has had anything
real to eat in days.

1032
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,318
- It's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?

1033
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,471
- We've all been in--
- Maybe it's the flu.

1034
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,835
No, no, it's not the flu.

1035
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,837
And how do you know?

1036
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,117
Books can be good for things other
than burning. What are her symptoms?

1037
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,875
I told you that she has a fever and her--
She's got a really cold sweat.

1038
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,712
How's her pulse?

1039
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,429
- It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?

1040
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,034
Like a cut that might have
gotten infected?

1041
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,556
She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.

1042
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,799
I didn't think anything of it.

1043
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,718
Oh, my gosh.

1044
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,872
That's blood poisoning. Septicemia.

1045
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,110
She could go into septic shock.

1046
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,271
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.

1047
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,396
She needs a massive dose
of penicillin. . .

1048
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,996
. . .or a broad-spectrum
antibiotic immediately, or. . . .

1049
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,073
Or what?

1050
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,275
I've never seen anything like it.

1051
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,950
There's no point of reference.
All I can see is cloud cover.

1052
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,553
What are you doing?

1053
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,950
Taking infrared image
of thermal currents.

1054
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,671
Send to Houston, Korolev,
your weather service.

1055
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,353
I'll help you.

1056
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:44,029
Tom? Tom, wake up.
I just received some satellite images. . .

1057
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,078
. . .from the space station.
You better take a look.

1058
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,639
How big is this thing?

1059
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,756
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.

1060
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,435
And growing. The two cells
over Europe and Asia are even bigger.

1061
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,828
Good God.

1062
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,798
This one's gonna hit New York
inside an hour.

1063
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,033
Jason!

1064
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,792
Are you all right?

1065
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,958
Jason!

1066
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,437
- What are you doing?
- There's gotta be medicine on that ship.

1067
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,957
I thought you said it was too dangerous
to go outside.

1068
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,394
I know I did.

1069
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,755
Where did you find those chairs?

1070
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,359
Why?

1071
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,679
I'm going with you.

1072
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,519
Me too.

1073
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,231
Come on, damn it!

1074
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,229
- It's all in Russian. I--
- I know.

1075
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,757
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?

1076
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,435
Because it says ""penicillin""
on the bottle.

1077
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,192
Hey, wait. This is the mess hall.

1078
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,635
- We should find some food.
- We don't have time.

1079
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,634
None of us are gonna survive much
longer without food. Including Laura.

1080
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,108
Okay.

1081
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,268
- Sam, over here.
- What?

1082
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,438
Bingo.

1083
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,592
Brian?

1084
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,834
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

1085
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,791
All I did was open up the cupboard.

1086
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,914
- Well, we can use it.
- For what?

1087
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,990
Put food in it.

1088
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,271
Pull him in, Brian!

1089
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,438
You all right?

1090
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,758
My leg.

1091
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,317
Here, use this.

1092
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,517
It should be over New York by now.

1093
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,309
Satellite readings show
a temperature drop. . .

1094
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,675
. . .of 10 degrees per second.

1095
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,953
You guys. . .

1096
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,111
. . .I think we're in the eye of it.

1097
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,957
We gotta get back right now.

1098
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:05,273
Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm
gonna lure the wolves out of the room.

1099
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,670
When they leave, you lock the door.

1100
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,394
Good luck.

1101
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:15,154
- Brian, hurry.
- I need something.

1102
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,717
Come on, hurry!

1103
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,116
Brian! Brian, open the door!

1104
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,512
We have to get out of here now.

1105
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,750
Brian, get the supplies.

1106
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,478
Oh, shit. Let's go!

1107
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,314
Pull, Brian!

1108
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,076
Take the medicine to Laura.

1109
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:46,078
We're almost there. Come on!

1110
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,913
Brian! Close the door!

1111
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,870
Don't let the fire go out!

1112
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,678
What's happening?

1113
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,758
Buddha, come away from the door.

1114
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,353
Come, Buddha, come!

1115
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,674
More books! More books!

1116
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,150
How long have I been out of it?

1117
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,872
Couple hours.

1118
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,519
How do you feel?

1119
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,399
Okay. What happened?

1120
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:24,076
Well, we had to get inside in kind of
a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.

1121
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,196
I should be used to you
pushing me around.

1122
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,517
Good to have you back.

1123
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,238
What are you doing?

1124
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:42,353
The eye of the storm has passed,
and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.

1125
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,158
Shouldn't we wait one more day?

1126
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,274
Sam may not have one more day.

1127
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,789
What do you think's
gonna happen to us?

1128
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,952
What do you mean?

1129
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:08,472
I mean us. Civilization. Everybody.

1130
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,552
Mankind survived the last Ice Age.

1131
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,837
We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.

1132
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,430
All depends on whether or not
we're able to learn from our mistakes.

1133
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:27,111
I sure as hell would like a chance
to learn from mine.

1134
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,390
You did everything you could.

1135
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,356
I was thinking about Sam.

1136
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,878
Jack, you know the chances of Sam. . . .

1137
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,389
I made my son a promise.

1138
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,357
I'm going to keep it.

1139
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,873
Parker, this is Houston. Do you read?

1140
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,917
Roger, mission control. Go ahead.

1141
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,789
We've got scattered reports that the
storm is dissipating over North America.

1142
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,077
Can you confirm?

1143
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,750
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.

1144
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,873
We're over Europe right now.

1145
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,077
I can see landmass
for the first time in days.

1146
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,149
How much further is it to the library?

1147
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,072
It should be. . .

1148
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,512
. . .right here.

1149
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,551
I'm sorry, Jack.

1150
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,352
Sam?

1151
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,393
Who is that?

1152
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:37,871
My father.

1153
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,839
You made it.

1154
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,911
Of course I did.

1155
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:40,637
Mr. President.

1156
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,791
I've just received a shortwave
radio transmission from Jack Hall.

1157
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,916
He made it to New York.

1158
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:50,392
He says there are survivors.

1159
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,752
Thank you, Tom.

1160
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,233
That's. . . .

1161
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,952
That's good news.

1162
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,835
These past few weeks have left us all
with a profound sense of humility...

1163
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,151
...in the face of nature's
destructive power.

1164
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:19,835
For years, we operated under the belief
that we could continue...

1165
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,438
...consuming our planet's natural
resources without consequence.

1166
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,992
We were wrong.

1167
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,112
I was wrong.

1168
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,993
The fact that my first address to you
comes from a consulate on foreign soil...

1169
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,631
...is a testament to our changed reality.

1170
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,592
Not only Americans...

1171
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,151
...but people all around the globe
are now guests in the nations...

1172
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,993
... we once called The Third World.

1173
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:52,312
In our time of need,
they have taken us in and sheltered us.

1174
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,396
And I am deeply grateful
for their hospitality.

1175
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:21,033
We mourn the loss of a spirited leader
whose courageous order to evacuate....

1176
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:25,751
Peter? Hey, you feeling okay today?

1177
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,639
For days, we've despaired
about the fate of the people...

1178
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,030
... who are trapped in the North.

1179
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,556
Today, there is cause for hope.

1180
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,036
Only a few hours ago, I received word
that a small group of people...

1181
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:42,351
...survived in New York City
against all odds...

1182
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,239
...and in the face
of tremendous adversity.

1183
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,994
I've ordered an immediate
search-and-rescue mission...

1184
