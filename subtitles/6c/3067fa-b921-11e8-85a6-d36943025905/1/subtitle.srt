1
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,451
Watch out for the devil!

2
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,682
Yin!

3
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,753
Yin!

4
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,164
Prajna paramita!

5
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:16,967
She is here!

6
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,680
I'll take care of her, come on

7
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,183
Watch out!

8
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,515
I saw it

9
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,864
This Tree Devil is very powerful

10
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,693
Now its energy is gone!

11
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,200
Let me freeze it with
the power from my palm

12
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,565
But it will resurrect
in a hundred year's time

13
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,772
Hocus pocus!

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,576
Prajna paramita!

15
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,024
Master, we've finally
found Kwan Bo County...

16
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,864
It's just over...

17
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,800
There? Over there?

18
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,637
Look at your map

19
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,638
Hey... it's flown away

20
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,144
Where's it gone?

21
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,352
We'll get to Kwan Bo County
if we head west

22
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,224
Master, there's rain clouds coming

23
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,798
Let's find shelter

24
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,797
Alright

25
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,333
Let's go...

26
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,802
There's a place to hide

27
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,581
Buddha, please make the rain go

28
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,082
so we can get on our way

29
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,124
Master, I'm not thirsty
you drink it

30
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,617
It's bad luck!

31
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,125
Go!

32
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,091
Gentlemen!

33
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,731
I didn't even recognize the skull

34
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,443
Give me my money back!

35
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,477
He's a master swordsman!

36
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,177
The man with the money
should go on ahead!

37
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,845
Run, run!

38
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,178
It's a tragedy, tragedy!

39
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,254
Master, there's a
killer outside, he's...

40
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,014
Here?

41
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,350
Thank god I got my money back!

42
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,323
I've been saving
if those thieves took it...

43
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,789
It's a bit cold, isn't it?

44
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:16,298
Money is illusion
why kill for it?

45
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,529
Be merciful, or you will
pay for your deeds

46
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,605
Merciful?
You don't have to make a living

47
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,039
I worked hard for this money!

48
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:28,946
You want to fight?

49
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,605
Master!

50
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,750
It's only a hoe

51
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,322
Fong, dust to dust
ashes to ashes...

52
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,223
Go and bury the bodies

53
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,589
This guy's really shifty, the gold...

54
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,428
Stop talking and start working

55
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,030
I'm soaked!
Don't mind if I light a fire?

56
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,976
Master, the bodies are in pieces

57
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,512
Do I bury hands with hands
and legs with legs?

58
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,245
No, be sure to bury whole corpses

59
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,348
I'm not sure that's possible

60
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,124
Alcohol keeps out the cold
Want some?

61
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,194
Let's all get warmer

62
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,160
You stupid fool!

63
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,465
Fire! Fire

64
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,129
Master, is this how you punish him?

65
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,104
Rubbish, I'm not an arsonist!

66
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,538
I'm sorry, we all make mistakes

67
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,076
I've made you lose your shelter

68
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,373
The market is just ahead!
We're all wanderers

69
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,982
We don't bear grudges
See you later

70
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,119
I've put the bodies back
together again

71
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,118
But there's one finger left

72
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,081
With my expertise
I don't bother with fingers

73
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,725
Maybe someone else did it

74
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,192
Are there other chopped up bodies?

75
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,095
This is common fighting ground
may die...

76
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,528
Enjoy putting them back together

77
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,565
Oh! It's getting dark

78
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,969
Ghost Festival sword
and weapons for sale

79
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,935
Help! Murder!

80
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,443
You hit me! Stay there!

81
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,205
This sword is the latest style!

82
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,145
Do you think I'm buying jewelry?

83
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,441
Who hit me? Show yourself and fight!

84
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,382
Who hit someone?

85
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,022
What's happening?

86
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,555
Make way!
Police passing through, make way!

87
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,251
Police passing, make way!

88
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,895
What's going on here?

89
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,054
I don't know

90
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,530
Forget it then

91
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,328
Hey, stop staring at me!

92
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,530
It's nothing, nothing's wrong!

93
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,037
Come look at our swords, sir

94
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,765
It's Ghost Festival!

95
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,104
The human race has stooped
to new lows

96
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,769
How can we Buddhists
redeem their souls?

97
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,041
I really don't know

98
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,208
With my wisdom, I can save them

99
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,786
But my body's feeling very weak

100
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,583
Let's find an inn

101
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,554
get some food and sleep

102
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,858
Buddha meditated facing
a wall for 3 years

103
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,122
and you complain after
no food for one day

104
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,925
For penance, chant 5,000 times

105
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,192
to purity the mind

106
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,528
Right!

107
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:07,161
Look, food, let's eat
then purity my mind

108
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,433
His brain's in his stomach!

109
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,770
That cretin

110
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,913
I'll kill him for 15 dollars

111
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,682
It was only 10 dollars
last time, why more?

112
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:19,612
Because I'm a better

113
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,683
swordsman now

114
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,480
So you say, but how good?

115
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,848
Beef brisket and noodles!

116
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,954
Hey, I never ordered that

117
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,815
Are you saying I made a mistake?

118
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,627
Orders returned are charged double!

119
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,693
What do you want?

120
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,490
I told you I didn't order it!

121
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,433
It's just a misunderstanding

122
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,738
As I improve
my price will rise again

123
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,134
If you don't like it
find someone else

124
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,299
For that price
I need some sort of sample

125
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,935
You want me to show off? No problem!
You want to see sample?

126
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,450
Sir, spare us some food?

127
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,054
I bet you my head

128
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,212
No, get lost!

129
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,881
Fong

130
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,721
My sword's a bit long, I'm sorry!

131
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,693
We shouldn't stay here, let's go!

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,763
Every time I see you there's trouble

133
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,230
Brother

134
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,169
and more trouble now

135
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,038
with that lump of gold!

136
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,317
Master, there's shelter ahead

137
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,021
It's a Temple

138
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,958
Orchid Temple

139
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,625
The entrance is over there

140
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,542
They've gone inside

141
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,701
But Orchid Temple's haunted
wait till dawn

142
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,742
Yes, let's wait!

143
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,710
Dawn? What if someone else gets it?

144
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,573
Hey, you lead! Me?

145
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,364
A ghost got my fool, run!

146
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,726
Run!

147
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,815
It's a bit draughty in here, Master

148
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,179
Don't be afraid, let me tell you

149
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,980
Orchid Temple is haunted

150
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,850
What? Haunted...

151
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,152
Master, Master!

152
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,322
Fong, stop stepping on my heels

153
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,695
I just want you to
know I'm behind you

154
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,463
If you're so scared
sleep outside the door

155
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,469
It's pouring outside

156
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,082
Master, if it's really haunted...

157
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,652
I don't mind if we carry on walking

158
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,188
Fong, we have Gold Buddha
to protect us

159
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,918
No one will dare come in

160
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,857
So we won't have to worry
about it being stolen

161
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,190
We'll just stay overnight

162
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,864
Shall we satisfy the God of Hunger?

163
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,734
You beg the ghosts
to spare you some food

164
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:33,237
Funny, I've forgotten
what I've just said!

165
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,044
Who said a ghost got his foot?
Was it you?

166
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,414
No
Was it you?

167
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,112
No
He did!

168
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,224
If it got you, how come you
could run so fast?

169
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:51,989
There's a woman singing, up there

170
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,966
Sister, it's raining
so hard outside

171
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,128
I wonder how long
before they come inside

172
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,542
We're here!

173
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,252
So many men!

174
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,380
Women! They're beautiful!

175
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,428
Smells so good

176
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,957
Don't go, so beautiful!

177
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,029
Come on

178
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,194
There are more!

179
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,396
They're so ugly!

180
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,574
The one in the middle's
the prettiest

181
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,219
She's so old!

182
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,356
The one next to her's beautiful

183
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:42,800
Priestress, there are so many
I'll help Lotus

184
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,095
Alright, that way I won't
have to wait so long

185
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,511
These men're already trapped
who needs your help?

186
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,814
I thought you'd be quicker
it took you ages

187
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,927
They're already ours
so what's the rush?

188
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,027
Take your clothes off
she's coming

189
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,026
I'm taking the prettiest one

190
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,596
Hands off!

191
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,101
Your skin's so soft

192
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,101
Give me a kiss!

193
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,430
Go to hell

194
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,746
There're all kinds of games
want to try?

195
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,543
Something in the water
bit me. What is it?

196
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,912
What is it? Let's go!

197
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:20,856
What's happening?
Let's go, they're demons

198
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,709
What's that sound, Master?

199
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,607
The ghosts are out

200
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,644
What shall I do? Master

201
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,011
Watch the Gold Buddha
and stay

202
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,618
I'm going to catch the demons!

203
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,621
Don't come near me
I have a Gold Buddha

204
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,502
You're powerful
you hide even from me!

205
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,347
Show your true selves!
Stars scatter!

206
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,735
Still able to hide
it's powerful!

207
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,478
Priestess, what about that monk?

208
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,144
Don't worry!

209
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:55,191
He maybe powerful
but he's no match for me

210
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,130
We'll play with them awhile
You seduce the little monk

211
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:08,371
Priestess, let me go
I can handle him

212
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,476
You're not experienced enough

213
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:16,046
when it comes to men

214
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,309
Priestess, I know exactly
what you mean

215
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,950
You don't want her
wasting your time

216
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,421
Let me bring him back to you quickly

217
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,405
Sorry

218
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,907
I forgot your cover was damaged

219
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,546
You got all wet

220
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,511
I'll say some prayers
as penance later

221
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,122
I know you have great powers

222
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,693
If we really meet a... ghost

223
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:08,322
Please help me destroy
whatever it is

224
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,917
Buddha!

225
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,787
Oh no!

226
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,056
Help, there's a ghost!

227
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,217
A ghost chasing her?
That means she's not a ghost

228
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,758
Help!

229
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,561
Ghost!

230
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,864
Lady!

231
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:46,861
Lady!

232
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,338
There's a ghost! Ghosts!

233
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,204
I'm so afraid!

234
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,983
I'm so scared, please help me!

235
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,551
I can see flesh!
Where is the ghost?

236
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,321
Let me hide behind you!

237
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,696
Look there's something
moving over there

238
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,429
Hold me tight!

239
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,540
Your leg

240
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,302
Feel my heart
it's beating so rapidly!

241
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,967
Come on!

242
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,973
I break my vows if
I'm near a woman!

243
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,174
Let's pray together

244
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,013
it'll keep the ghosts away

245
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,123
Don't pray now
let's do something else!

246
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,263
Let me go, or I'll break my vows!

247
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,762
Did you know, you're my first man?

248
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,958
Let me help you undress

249
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,830
What? Undress?

250
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,301
Hey wait, my shoe!

251
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,565
If Master sees me like this

252
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,265
He'll never believe I was
saving your life!

253
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,875
No! I must pray

254
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,576
Where're my prayer books?

255
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,180
Where're my prayer books?

256
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,680
Fire! Come and save me!

257
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,688
How did it catch fire?

258
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,160
My clothes are on fire!

259
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,421
Take your clothes off!

260
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:24,029
Fire, help!

261
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,395
Stop undressing
They're not burning now!

262
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,267
I must, I'm afraid of fire!

263
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,671
But I'll see everything

264
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,208
Lady

265
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,517
Hey, monk... has the fire gone out?

266
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,515
It was so dangerous!

267
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,481
My clothes are all burnt, what to do?

268
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,184
Cover yourself with my robe

269
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,124
You're so kind!

270
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,490
Put it on quickly, I won't watch

271
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,394
I tripped on your clothes

272
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,001
Stop or I won't be able
to control myself!

273
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,139
I'm a bad girl
Are you as bad as me?

274
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,405
I thought you were being
chased by a ghost?

275
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,804
Ghost? Here's your ghost!
Come and get me

276
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,913
This is fun!

277
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,052
But it didn't last long!

278
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,191
Lucky I prayed in time

279
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,666
Or I would've done that
"stuff" with you

280
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,735
Hey, monk...

281
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,301
What would you have done?
Tell me

282
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,603
I said means I want...
I want means I desire...

283
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,245
I desire means I'll do...

284
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,278
If I do, I'll never stay a monk!

285
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,882
No, I must pray

286
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,451
Stop praying, help me up

287
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,319
Quick!

288
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,221
I'll help you up

289
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,325
But you promise not to
come too close

290
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,587
Damn I saw it!

291
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,393
Aren't you interested in me at all?

292
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,495
Interested? In what way?

293
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,603
All men are interested in this!

294
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,932
Don't take off my pants

295
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,539
It's strange!
Your head aches when I pray

296
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,511
You weren't being
chased by a ghost!

297
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,820
You are a ghost!

298
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,354
I'm going to get you!

299
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,273
It's really haunted
I'm scared!

300
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,610
I better run!

301
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,290
Come over here!

302
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,091
Reveal your true form!

303
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,061
You're mine

304
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,860
Reveal yourself!

305
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,798
Stupid monk, why've you
stopped praying?

306
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,700
Go, if Master returns
you'll never escape!

307
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,905
Why are you letting me go?

308
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,239
I'm giving you a
chance to reform

309
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,210
So you can reincarnate
as a good person

310
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,612
I'm evil! I'll never change

311
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,046
Hey, my robe!

312
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,586
If you want it, get it yourself!

313
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,186
It serves you right!

314
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,425
Help me, quick help me!

315
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,042
Go on, scram!

316
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,406
Waiting for me to hit you?

317
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,752
Hey, my robe!

318
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,871
Still playing games with me!

319
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,437
Master!
You appeared so suddenly!

320
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,408
Fong, what're you doing
here half naked?

321
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,045
It's too hot
I came outside to cool down

322
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,081
Hot? Where's the Gold Buddha?

323
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,878
It's inside, it'sjust fine!

324
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,545
Well, did you see anything untoward?

325
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,557
No way, not with the
Gold Buddha here

326
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,750
No ghost would dare come near

327
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,622
Even if it did
it wouldn't get away!

328
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,492
And did you find anything?

329
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,999
That demon is quite something

330
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,068
Anyway

331
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,226
we're staying
only one night

332
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,702
and leaving tomorrow
with the Gold Buddha

333
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,135
So we'd better get some rest

334
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,832
Or we'll be tired tomorrow

335
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,310
Okay...

336
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,675
I'll capture them sooner or later

337
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,977
Your senses are impure
that's why you're hot

338
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,346
Take the Gold Buddha out and pray

339
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,216
Take the Gold Buddha out?

340
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,217
Pray all night

341
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,860
in front of it

342
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,254
On my own?

343
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,794
Why, you want me to keep you company?

344
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,522
No, no!

345
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,127
Okay, let's go inside!

346
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,369
Will you stop that
If Master sees it, I've had it!

347
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,243
Fong

348
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,751
Good morning Master

349
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,818
Bring the Buddha, we're leaving

350
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,356
O kay

351
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,221
Darn, he'll find out
sooner or later

352
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,156
Please help me find
the Gold Buddha!

353
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,022
What did you say?

354
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,096
Nothing, just saying my prayers

355
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,227
Fong

356
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,862
I'm glad the Buddha's safe

357
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,405
Or there's no point in
going to Imperial Temple

358
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,735
That's right!

359
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,846
Master, if we leave like
this now

360
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,777
It's not quite right

361
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,382
Since you know Orchid Temple
is haunted

362
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,483
Shouldn't we stay

363
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,051
and get rid of the demons?

364
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,918
Sort of say in some manuscript

365
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,649
"If no one goes to hell

366
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,192
and we don't go to hell

367
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,522
Who will go to hell?"

368
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,760
You're a monk

369
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,594
and you don't know which manuscript!

370
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,333
I've always had a bad memory

371
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,734
But leaving like this
is irresponsible

372
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,171
You're right! I'll stay
and catch the demons

373
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,971
You take the Buddha
to Imperial Temple

374
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,613
Right, I'll go

375
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,551
Fong, are you alright?

376
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,683
Yes

377
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,420
after praying all night
my mind is pure

378
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,117
But my stomach is even purer

379
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,388
and now in the sun, I feel faint

380
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,259
Are you saying that...

381
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,094
You're sick?

382
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,295
I'll be fine Master
I'll overcome it

383
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,904
I'll make it

384
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,563
I'm getting there
it's getting better...

385
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,801
No it's not working...
I'm going to faint

386
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,142
I think you're hungry

387
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,145
I'll beg for food

388
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,619
My student does not
behave like a monk

389
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,619
Buddha be merciful!

390
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,887
Gold Buddha
I'd better find you today!

391
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,790
Haven't slept all night
I feel faint

392
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,434
I'll find the Buddha
and get Master to leave

393
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,762
Or when he's out

394
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:46,926
she'll come for me again

395
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,868
and it'll be another sleepless night!

396
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,507
Snake!

397
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,159
What now? Oh no!

398
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,894
I only have a day left

399
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,230
Buddha, have mercy, help Fong

400
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,000
Buddha!

401
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,437
Look this blade cuts heads
off like slicing melons

402
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,741
Really?
Let's try it on your head

403
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,875
Please be merciful
put down your knives

404
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:35,747
Get lost

405
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,387
Give me something

406
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,456
Shove off!

407
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,451
You monks
always lecturing people

408
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,822
You're ruining our business

409
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,293
Get lost!

410
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,562
Give me the money you owe me

411
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,761
I don't have any money

412
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,235
Give my money back!

413
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,033
No money?
What's all that on the ground?

414
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,197
That's my money!

415
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,308
It's mine now

416
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,375
Since when did I owe you money?

417
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,137
When you asked me to do the job

418
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,813
Whatjob?

419
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,677
I don't know you

420
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,908
Exactly, he doesn't know you!

421
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,347
The money's mine

422
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,486
I don't know him

423
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,848
Go to hell

424
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,521
Sir, how do you know
the money's yours?

425
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,261
He's right, prove it's yours
and you can have it!

426
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,329
Right, you said it
you better mean it

427
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,758
Abracadabra...

428
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,198
Rise...

429
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,436
Money, money, are you mine?

430
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,402
Ah! It's black magic!

431
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,571
Let's go!

432
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,513
You also follow Buddha
you should do good

433
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,882
Not concern yourself with money

434
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,853
How else would you get any alms?

435
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,014
I wouldn't accept that sort of money

436
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,056
No? Then leave

437
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,421
At least I earn my money

438
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,620
You wander around
begging for food

439
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,822
You're just a beggar in disguise!

440
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:01,066
Money is only illusion

441
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,967
You can't get what's not yours

442
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,210
Monk, is this your doing?

443
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,112
Mercy, Buddha is merciful

444
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,851
You're a fake, monk!
Admit your pranks!

445
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,616
There must be a way

446
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,283
to break his spell!

447
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,457
Hey, don't go! Don't go!

448
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,227
My money!

449
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,040
Another fruitless job

450
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,368
Damn monk!

451
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:44,739
It's getting dark!

452
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,751
What shall I tell Master?

453
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,078
I'll say the
snakes took it

454
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,718
How could the snakes take it?

455
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,925
Right, I'll say the
ghosts took it

456
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,860
The Gold Buddha repels ghosts
impossible!

457
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,229
I'll tell him the truth

458
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,634
That'll be Master

459
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,171
I didn't mean it Master
I just dropped it!

460
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,311
Master, actually...

461
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,138
It's you?

462
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,780
It's you again?

463
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,506
What are you doing here?

464
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,522
Darn!
Let me rest for one night okay?

465
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,624
The way you live
don't you feel like a whore?

466
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,020
Perhaps if you were human
making a living

467
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,457
But you're a ghost
why a slut too?

468
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,725
Am I a slut?

469
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,559
Anyone who strips a guy's
pants off is a slut!

470
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,706
What are you looking for?

471
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,205
The Gold Buddha...

472
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,376
I don't know where it...
The Gold Buddha?

473
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,671
Why're you getting so close?

474
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,043
I had enough fun last night!

475
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,613
It's only down there

476
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,482
Don't come so close to me!

477
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,715
You think I don't want to?

478
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,717
I can't leave till the
Gold Buddha's found

479
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:04,993
I'll help you

480
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,887
The Gold Buddha's
very powerful

481
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,088
Aren't you afraid?

482
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,858
There's no other way

483
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,764
If you don't leave
I'll have to move!

484
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,605
That's a point!

485
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,740
Let's go together!

486
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,977
Last night you surprised
me and I fell

487
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,171
I dropped the Gold Buddha
somewhere here

488
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,642
Don't step on my clothes

489
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,149
If they fall off
you'll say I was stripping

490
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,518
Where is it?

491
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,528
Snakes! I forgot to say
there're snakes here

492
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,323
Where?

493
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,090
Over there!

494
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,893
Where?

495
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,869
Stop it, my head aches!

496
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,307
I'm only praying very softly

497
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,468
Go upstairs
you're getting in the way

498
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,671
With you here
I'll never find it!

499
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,145
Go on!

500
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,614
You're right

501
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,810
Mind the snakes

502
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,218
Snakes! Lots of snakes!

503
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,695
The Gold Buddha! I found it!

504
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,941
Where is it?

505
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,510
Over there, help me

506
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,647
There're many snakes

507
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,515
I didn't tell you to kill them

508
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:46,057
How did this happen?
What will I say?

509
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,720
How can I put it back together?

510
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:55,634
I've been bitten by a snake
It hurts!

511
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,797
Help!

512
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,501
I don't want to kill you, go!

513
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,104
Are you alright?

514
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,977
I've been poisoned

515
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,344
What shall we do?

516
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,214
Suck the venom out
with your mouth

517
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,289
Please, quick

518
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,294
I can feel the venom...
I feel faint

519
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,432
Is that alright?

520
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,935
That's fine, thank you

521
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,266
It's okay, anyway your
wound isn't real

522
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,008
Then why did you swallow the blood?

523
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,441
To keep you happy

524
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:40,675
The wound isn't real
but the venom is!

525
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,344
You're right, that means...

526
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,810
I'll help you suck it out

527
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,685
No, that means mouth to mouth

528
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,717
You'll die once

529
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,293
the venom takes effect

530
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,656
Pretend I'm not a woman

531
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,559
Then who are you?

532
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,393
Pretend I'm your Master

533
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,398
He would never do this

534
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,900
Pretend I'm your mother

535
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:06,000
I've never met my mother
Try someone I've seen

536
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,841
How about him?

537
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,352
Him?

538
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,647
O kay

539
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,257
Whatever

540
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,175
What are you doing?

541
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,833
Sucking the venom

542
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,039
What did you stick in my stomach?

543
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,477
My tongue

544
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,981
Why stick your tongue
in my stomach?

545
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,017
To suck out the venom!

546
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,519
There's still some left in you

547
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,721
Really?

548
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,654
Is your heart beating rapidly?

549
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,557
Yes!

550
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,493
Does your whole body feel hot?

551
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,256
Yes

552
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,333
Do you feel sweaty
your head ache?

553
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,525
Yes

554
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,693
That's the effect
of the venom

555
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,498
We have to carry on

556
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,504
I'd rather die

557
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,633
Don't die here

558
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,005
Or you'll become

559
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,942
one of us

560
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,381
Okay, come on

561
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,754
Hang on

562
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,029
Are you ready?

563
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,241
Yes,... why didn't you stick
your tongue inside?

564
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:27,077
No! there's no venom
I was lying

565
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,517
How dare you deceive
an honest man

566
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,317
It's because of you
I dropped the Buddha

567
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,958
Look how I treat you
Is this my thanks?

568
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,320
I'm a monk!
I have rules to follow

569
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,464
You keep seducing me
You're trouble!

570
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,757
Really?

571
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,471
From what you say
isn't it a bore being a monk?

572
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:52,433
You can't do what every
man wants to do

573
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,269
Don't you feel deprived
being a monk?

574
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,549
Deprived?

575
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,083
I never had anything to lose

576
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,380
The priority is to
fix the Buddha...

577
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,955
So when Master comes
back we can leave

578
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,428
Don't set your clothes
on fire again!

579
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,960
Why're you a monk

580
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,628
if it's such hard work?

581
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,273
The first person I set
eyes on was Master

582
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,774
My first clothes
were monk's robes...

583
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,674
What else can I be
except a monk...

584
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,474
Do I have a choice?

585
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:36,583
You're grown up now
you can choose

586
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,881
I've been with Master for years

587
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,149
He's family...

588
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,417
Why'd my parents

589
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,390
leave me in a monastery

590
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,597
I'd like to know what
my parents look like...

591
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,298
So that if I ever met them...

592
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,965
I could avoid them

593
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,602
Don't fall off!
Don't fall off!

594
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,404
Your life is better
than mine was...

595
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,641
At least you have a Master!

596
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,546
No...

597
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,752
I was sold as soon
as I was born

598
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,952
Whoever bought me
became my parents

599
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,530
Finally a rich man
took me as his 2nd wife

600
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,396
I was murdered by his mistress

601
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,230
and buried here

602
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,808
That's the first time
I've told this story

603
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,605
I way lying

604
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,016
I'm glad it's a lie

605
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,151
If it were true it
would be tragic

606
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,250
So in comparison

607
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,114
you're free now

608
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,614
Not being sold again and again...

609
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:50,418
Pity you're a ghost
we could've been friends

610
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,559
Aren't we friends now?

611
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:04,701
Little monk

612
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,241
could you get close to anyone else?

613
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,145
I don't know

614
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,543
Do you think I'm beautiful?

615
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,217
I don't know

616
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,828
Oh no, Master's returned, run away!

617
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,051
Fong, what are you doing?

618
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,278
Master, I'm just repairing
the stairs...

619
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,616
Wait outside, it's almost done

620
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,723
The feeling of evil
is stronger today

621
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,533
Master, you can't go inside

622
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,229
There are snakes inside

623
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,839
Snakes?

624
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,007
My powers protect and make me
immune to venom...

625
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,771
Snakes don't come near me

626
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,449
She must be gone by now!

627
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,553
The demons are close by

628
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,457
Fong

629
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,357
Why're you holding a comb?

630
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,336
I bought it to...

631
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,872
comb my eyebrows
It looks great...

632
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,634
You want to try it?

633
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:51,307
Shave your eyebrows
and you won't need a comb

634
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,277
Where's the Gold Buddha?

635
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:07,558
It's over there Master, see it?

636
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,863
Fong, close all the windows

637
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,231
To stop the demons entering

638
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,063
Very clever, Master!

639
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,382
Thank God, Master didn't
run into her!

640
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:10,753
Fong, bring me the gold paint

641
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,021
O kay

642
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,263
Oh, it was on the table

643
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:41,715
Your gold paint

644
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,094
Oh no, it's finished, Master

645
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,223
I haven't written on
all the windows yet...

646
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,624
Bring out all our holy objects

647
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,598
Seal all the entrances

648
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,248
Oh no!

649
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,093
Fong, what is it?
Did you see something?

650
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,930
It's just that I haven't
eaten all day...

651
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,930
I'm feeling a big faint...

652
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,568
Master, let me help you

653
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,603
I found you some food

654
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,331
get it from my bag

655
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:36,668
The ghosts will come
from this direction...

656
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,781
But we've run out
of holy objects

657
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:39,813
There's a gap over there...

658
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,814
Why don't you hang it up there?

659
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,153
This is where the evil's
the strongest

660
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,050
I'll repel it

661
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,553
Master, some ghost
took your beads!

662
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:47,012
Strange, how could a ghost
take my beads?

663
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,544
I'll get rid of all of them!

664
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,521
Help!

665
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,362
Fong is in trouble!

666
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,963
Little monk!

667
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,160
You shameless demon!

668
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,115
Help! Help

669
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:25,448
Help me! Master! Help! Master!

670
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,717
Mercy shrouds the world!

671
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,194
Help me!

672
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,400
The stars will scatter!

673
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,139
Fong, listen to me...

674
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,182
Go back and bring me
my holy objects

675
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,411
Right!

676
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,757
Mercy is boundless!

677
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:21,069
Help! I'm up here!

678
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,273
I warned you not to play
with that staff

679
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,511
Help!

680
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,482
Are you alright?

681
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,321
Get it away from me!

682
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:42,097
How come you are... so cold?

683
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:49,403
Leave me alone, I have to rest...

684
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:52,098
Otherwise I won't survive
as a ghost

685
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:55,969
Right, I'll go and save Master then

686
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,206
It doesn't look like you can move

687
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,658
Have you recovered?
I must go and save Master

688
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,798
Hush!

689
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,229
It feels cold!
What's happening?

690
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,997
One of my sisters is here

691
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,034
Good. I'll ask her to help you!

692
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,838
No, we hate each other

693
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,413
If you bring her here
we'll both be in trouble

694
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:33,514
So what can we do?

695
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,648
I can smell a human

696
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,649
Let's have a look

697
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,980
Don't worry, I have the staff

698
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,417
There's no time

699
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,359
Oh, it's you!

700
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,029
Are you surprised?

701
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,033
Fooling around behind
the Priestess's back?

702
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,869
How dare you disobey her orders?

703
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,466
Why do you look so ill?

704
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,644
Maybe you're the one
fooling around!

705
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,835
Are you bitching because
you feel guilty?

706
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,416
I helped the Priestess
fight the two monks...

707
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,019
and I got wounded...

708
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,922
Come over and help me...

709
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,387
Why should I help you?...

710
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,257
You put on these airs...

711
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,523
I'm sorry, I have no time

712
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,696
What was that?

713
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,301
Someone's hiding behind me

714
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,533
Who?

715
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,076
The little monk

716
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,237
Really?

717
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,681
Trying to trick me
into helping you?

718
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:51,018
No chance!
I'd never help you!

719
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:55,528
Why don't you stay
and wait for the Priestess

720
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,630
You're so cunning...

721
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,496
Trying to delay me

722
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:04,231
from helping the Priestess...

723
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,773
I won't tall for your tricks...

724
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,640
Let's go

725
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,554
That was a bit bluff...

726
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,563
If she'd believed you
I'd be dead

727
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,930
But if we didn't hate each other...

728
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,434
You wouldn't have had to hide

729
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,164
So you change your story
as it pleases you?

730
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,671
Fong!

731
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,268
I can't take you further
I must save Master...

732
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,707
You be on your way

733
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,772
Fong

734
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,246
What?

735
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,743
I was called Lotus
when I was alive

736
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,582
Why're you telling me?
I won't be visiting you...

737
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,554
and you won't be visiting me...

738
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,850
Man and ghost can't be together...

739
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,724
and even if you were human
it'd be hopeless

740
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,025
Because monks and women
can't be together

741
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,896
Remember, be more
careful in future

742
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,129
If you meet any
other monks

743
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,672
they won't give you a chance

744
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,607
Take care of yourself!

745
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:36,224
Damn monk, think you're
the most powerful?!

746
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,731
Tree Devil, you kill innocents
and insult God...

747
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,461
I'm going to capture you

748
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:42,935
That will be your punishment

749
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:46,564
Punishment?
You mean I will reap what I sow?

750
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:50,008
Exactly!
Those are the karmic rules

751
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,238
Don't you know wicked people

752
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,780
are buried with honour

753
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,316
Their deeds enshrined
in books and songs!

754
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,587
But when dead

755
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,019
they suffer in hell

756
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,218
Hell is only as dark as
the human world

757
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,486
Only the powerful
and ruthless thrive

758
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,631
There's still time to change
your ways, bald monk!

759
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,356
I've been to hell
so I know

760
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,236
Master! Your staff!

761
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:18,034
But I used it to pin down
the other ghost!

762
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,807
The dark deep underworld arise!

763
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,150
There is no justice!

764
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,438
Master!

765
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,443
Evil will win, and never fatter!
