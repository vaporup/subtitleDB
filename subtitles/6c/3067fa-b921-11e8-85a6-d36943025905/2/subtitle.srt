1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,017
Fong, give me the Gold Buddha!

2
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:09,345
Right!

3
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,981
I forgot to tell you it's broken!

4
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:18,954
Now you tell me!

5
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,233
Master!

6
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:39,908
Fong, ride my staff
with the Buddha

7
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:41,516
Get it fixed

8
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,175
then come and save me

9
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:44,820
Master!

10
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:18,552
Master!

11
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:22,719
Fong!

12
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:26,024
Who is it?

13
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:27,390
Show yourself!

14
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:30,761
Leave quickly
the Priestess will be back soon!

15
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,034
Is it Lotus?

16
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:35,234
Follow my cloak!

17
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,972
You can't fight the Priestess

18
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,483
Don't look back
just move forward

19
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:51,445
Remember not to look back

20
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,852
Never come back!

21
00:01:57,027 --> 00:02:00,485
Never come back!

22
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,327
It's getting light

23
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:15,941
Come and look, brand new weapons

24
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:18,012
Come and look

25
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:23,745
You're from Shaolin Temple?
Special price!

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,909
I have no money

27
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:26,248
Who shall I ask?

28
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,481
We use real iron

29
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,487
I'll think about it

30
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,489
For every $10 spent
a free horseshoe!

31
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,025
I'll give you two

32
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,025
I'm only here to beg for food

33
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,857
Beg for food? Get lost!

34
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:40,802
The world's corrupt
it's hard to find honesty

35
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,863
Let me help you!

36
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,506
Little monk, this place is bad
go elsewhere

37
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:50,305
Brother, you're a blacksmith
aren't you?

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,310
Not much longer

39
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:52,743
A decent man can't survive here

40
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,940
Will you do business with me?

41
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:54,981
I don't sell weapons

42
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,085
I don't want weapons
I need repairs

43
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,851
Have a look

44
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:03,022
You crazy?

45
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:04,217
If it's seen, you'll be dead

46
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:05,622
Put it away!

47
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,556
Please help me, it's an emergency!

48
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:09,391
Is this Buddha yours
or did you steal it?

49
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,965
Do I look like a thief?

50
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:12,834
Alright then, I'll do a good deed

51
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,402
You are so kind

52
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:21,970
Thank you

53
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:28,877
I thought you were going to

54
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,019
fix the Gold Buddha?

55
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:31,517
What Gold Buddha?
I didn't see any

56
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,246
What Gold Buddha?
You just threw it in there!

57
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,220
Leave me alone

58
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:36,017
I don't want your
business, scram!

59
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:37,716
Give it back...
I need it to save someone

60
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:38,826
Give my Gold Buddha back!

61
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:39,825
Help!

62
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,930
Give it back, or I'll kill you!

63
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,195
I'm being beaten up by a monk!

64
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:47,358
I don't want trouble

65
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:48,663
but he stole my Gold Buddha

66
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:49,770
Gold?

67
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,769
Not gold, just my Buddha

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,339
Search him, maybe he's
carrying more gold

69
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,875
I'm not, I'm not...

70
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:56,740
Get him!

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,979
Get him!

72
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,183
What the hell?

73
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,618
It's the little monk!

74
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,281
It's you?
They stole something from me

75
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,058
Let's go!

76
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:13,429
Do you want me to help you?

77
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:14,961
Yes

78
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,923
Your Master owes me $10...

79
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,133
With this, it's a total of $15

80
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,669
They... they stole my Gold Buddha

81
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,466
Gold? Hang on...

82
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,938
Makes it more pricey
an extra 300

83
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:27,076
Plus a bowl of noodles

84
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,574
that's $320

85
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:30,007
But I have no money!

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,374
Good bye!

87
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:33,038
But my Master has some

88
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,616
That makes it okay!
I won't cheat you, let's go

89
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:42,550
Quickly!

90
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:43,420
Calm down!

91
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:44,924
It's them!

92
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,687
Brothers...
They're here

93
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,860
...that Gold Buddha is mine...

94
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:49,293
It should be returned
to it's rightful owner

95
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:50,262
Who says? Finders keepers

96
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,333
just because you've got a big sword

97
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:53,400
There are more of us!

98
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,730
Attack!

99
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:00,105
Let's melt it, goodbye Gold Buddha!

100
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,340
The Gold Buddha!

101
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,649
Oh no, it's melted!

102
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:16,724
You're amazing?

103
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:17,791
What's amazing?

104
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,519
Isn't it hot?

105
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,494
I wonder if it still has any powers?

106
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,965
Master is in real trouble now

107
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,570
Don't be negative
there's always a way

108
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:29,534
Little monk...

109
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:30,866
Let's go and get money
from your Master

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,007
But I haven't worked out
how to save him

111
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:33,233
That's easy

112
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,104
Hire me to help you save him

113
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:38,008
I'll give you a special
discount, 2 times $300

114
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:38,943
What do you think?

115
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:40,639
Forget it, no deal

116
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:42,409
Get out of my way!
I'll kill you!

117
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:43,745
Don't you want to
save your Master?

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,114
Of course I do

119
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:46,016
Then you have to pay me

120
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,316
But I have no money

121
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:49,480
Will you do it on credit?

122
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,183
Sure! It's a big deal

123
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,056
Wonton noodles!

124
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,457
Hey, you look like
you're starving

125
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:57,827
Have some noodles!

126
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,025
I told you I have no money

127
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,760
It's okay, I'll keep a tab

128
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:02,662
You'll have to pay up
when it reaches $1,000

129
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,350
Don't worry

130
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,493
As long as I'm around
it'll be fine

131
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:26,922
Hey, I don't even know your name

132
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,489
My name's Yin

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,827
That's quite a name

134
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,025
It was someone else's name

135
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:37,435
a high Priest

136
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,598
I begged him to take me
in as his student

137
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,811
But he said he didn't
like people

138
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:43,445
and refused to teach me!

139
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,604
You see, he's really stubborn!

140
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:57,821
Maybe if you ask again
he'll change his mind

141
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,755
He's dead now!

142
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:01,328
He was antisocial

143
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,362
so had no friends

144
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:06,164
Not even money to buy a coffin!

145
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:10,739
I've learnt my lesson
money before everything!

146
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:12,968
Why's that?

147
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,269
With money you can be
whatever you want!

148
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,947
What do you want to be?

149
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,015
A rich Yin!

150
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:23,015
And what do you want to be?

151
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,416
A good man!

152
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,682
A good man? Like my namesake?

153
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,121
Living a lonely life

154
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,818
You think good reaps good?

155
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,260
All good men end like that!

156
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,833
Someone's in trouble!

157
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,170
Don't worry, it's her!

158
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:49,611
Help, help! Open the door!

159
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,440
There's a ghost after me!

160
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,981
Hey, it's me, hey...

161
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:01,555
Ghost... help me

162
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:05,387
Hey, she's on our side...
it's me...

163
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:08,223
I've been waiting for you
it's Fong...

164
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:09,490
You can stop all
the dancing around...

165
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,258
Hey, stop it, stop it

166
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,366
Stop it?!

167
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:18,335
Who are you?

168
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,843
I'm so scared!

169
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,375
Come over here

170
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,620
I don't get it
Explain what you're doing

171
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,280
I can't, it's all a mistake

172
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,758
Something over there's moving!

173
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,140
Yes...
I know a ghost's after you

174
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:56,073
Then you must protect me!

175
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,735
I know you need protection

176
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,614
But we're not suited
to each other

177
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,520
Why?

178
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:07,349
I mean...
I don't mean you're not pretty...

179
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:11,983
To be honest...
Please don't get angry, but I...

180
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,755
I don't go for your type
that's all

181
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,428
I prefer a longer face
slight buck teeth

182
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:22,332
Maybe that much taller than me

183
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:26,872
If you know her

184
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:28,943
go and ask her to come here

185
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,540
Be careful not to
burn your clothes

186
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,547
You're so bad

187
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,279
You want a manage a trios?

188
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:43,117
You studious types are so naughty

189
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,032
Hey, come over here!

190
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,273
Lady, just hang on a moment

191
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:06,377
Wait here, I'm just going
over for a chat

192
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:08,708
What's the matter?

193
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:10,284
She's not right for you
but she is for me...

194
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:11,385
I don't want your money

195
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:13,044
I'll have her instead

196
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:14,382
No way!

197
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:16,414
What, you've undressed her?

198
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,992
No need to undress
let's do it like this!

199
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:20,661
Give that to me!

200
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,089
No, the clothes are
stuck to my hands!

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,025
I said no, I don't know her!

202
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,535
Another piece of clothing?

203
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:37,109
You don't know her
but you remove her underwear?!

204
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,872
Put it on, put it on!

205
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,276
I don't care, I want her!

206
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,280
I'm paying you instead

207
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:42,213
I don't want money!

208
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,409
I don't want money, I want her!

209
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:44,951
No!

210
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:47,519
Hey, what're you doing?

211
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,924
Hey, now about if I pay you?

212
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:52,718
Look, I'm giving
you a good deal!

213
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:54,959
Just stop it, it's been decided

214
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,357
I'm sorry Miss!

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,264
It's the first time
I've played this game!

216
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,403
I'm sorry to bother you...

217
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:04,699
Remember, long face
slight buck teeth when she smiles...

218
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:09,140
About 6 inches taller
than me, thanks!

219
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,339
What a waste
you didn't even ask her name

220
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:13,743
How can we find her again?

221
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,940
We're here to save my Master

222
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:16,278
Not do that sort of thing

223
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:17,282
If you want it so much

224
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,852
come back another time

225
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,080
Don't worry, Iwill!

226
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:23,418
Help! Help!

227
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,083
I'll go!
I'm going!

228
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:29,197
Help!

229
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,532
It's you!
Why are you back here?

230
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:40,199
I'm so glad
it's finally your turn!

231
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,308
These ghosts are beauties...

232
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:43,911
...she's even better

233
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,274
I almost mistook the
last girl for you!

234
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,415
Who was here?

235
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,345
Your sister!

236
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:50,615
Anymore sisters?

237
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:54,223
We'll be discovered here
let's go upstairs

238
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,652
Right

239
00:11:56,025 --> 00:12:00,928
There's no one else!
Going to keep here for yourself?

240
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,493
Hey. What are you doing?

241
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:08,328
What?

242
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:09,163
What are you doing?

243
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:10,032
Pretending to be intimate!

244
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:11,195
Pretending to be intimate?

245
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:13,501
He's Yin, I've employed him
to help save Master

246
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:15,234
She's Lotus

247
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,476
Hey, what are you doing?

248
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,046
Pretending to be intimate

249
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,309
You don't have to as well
stand aside and watch!

250
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:25,977
I don't trust you

251
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,479
Damn monk, if you can why can't I?

252
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:28,715
Don't use business
as an excuse for pleasure

253
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:30,518
Do you think I want this?

254
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:33,919
I'm a reluctant victim too

255
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:35,358
We're not looking
very convincing

256
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:36,327
Let's get into bed!

257
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:37,261
Into bed?

258
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,663
Into bed?
If you won't do it, I will!

259
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,803
You won't go to be! I will!

260
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:42,993
How come I can't?

261
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:47,538
Come on

262
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,480
It's better if you're on top

263
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,127
Let's make it clear
no more praying!

264
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:08,491
I'll try my best, what next?

265
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,222
Next we kiss!

266
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,952
Undaunted by the misty fog

267
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,179
Behind the mystery
is a sweet surprise

268
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,153
Dashing through the sun and moon

269
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:37,485
Dancing to the beat of the gong

270
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:42,954
Nothing can dempen my chivalry

271
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:48,600
Stop the noise
this a serious business

272
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:53,302
Nothing can stop my
will to strike again

273
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:54,875
Do you know where Master is?

274
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,841
The priestess's got him

275
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,447
but I don't know where

276
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:01,976
How can we get her to come here?

277
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,816
There's a bell on my ankle

278
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:06,352
She'll answer it
if she hers it ring

279
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,012
A bell?

280
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,485
So why don't you ring it?

281
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,528
Don't stop, or they might
suspect us, carry on!

282
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,566
Don't stick your tongue
into my stomach!

283
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,134
I won't, we'll just kiss!

284
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:22,895
That's okay!

285
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:14,011
I can't bear it

286
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,522
I'm going for a walk!

287
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,084
Hey, don't go!

288
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:20,626
I can't be bothered to watch

289
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,962
Yin, where are you going?

290
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:25,828
For a walk!

291
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,366
You can't go, stay here

292
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:28,901
Go away

293
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,437
What will I do if you go?

294
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:34,069
I can't bear watching you two

295
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,844
Young student!

296
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:41,444
Open the door
I'm so scared outside

297
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:43,084
Let me come in

298
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,251
She's so scared!

299
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,910
What's that got to do with you?
It's Butterfly!

300
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:48,249
You wait here, I'll handle her

301
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,250
Don't go, the two of us are rivals

302
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,054
Even better, then there
won't be any bickering

303
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:54,856
You're really a pain
in the neck

304
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,361
Carry on like this
and I won't pay you

305
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:57,897
Don't mention money
I haven't seen a cent yet

306
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:58,761
Where's the money? Huh?

307
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,458
Hush!

308
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:01,933
Lotus, lend me some money

309
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:04,839
so I can pay him

310
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,804
Just so I can shut him up!

311
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:09,711
I don't want money
he wants me to take it

312
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,210
I'm happy with alternatives

313
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,610
You can talk, but touch her

314
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,211
So you've got to help me

315
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:19,778
You two are trouble, I'm going

316
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:20,614
Let me protect you

317
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,882
Forget it!

318
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,561
So you got thrown out too?

319
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:31,722
No such luck

320
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,402
Those two fought over me

321
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,227
If not for the fact they've
got more friends coming

322
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,999
I would have left ages ago

323
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,540
Don't stand here, go in and help

324
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:47,346
Lady, we students love
playing games

325
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:48,881
Let's have some fun!

326
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,541
Okay!

327
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,380
I said you weren't my type

328
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,182
Don't hang around

329
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:57,848
Open up, open the door

330
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:59,756
I have no time for you

331
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:03,057
I don't believe I'm less
attractive than Lotus!

332
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:08,031
You can't force your way in!

333
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:09,296
I want you to fancy me

334
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:12,566
Seduce me, I'm easy to seduce!

335
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,205
Can't we talk a bit first?

336
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:16,571
I can't wait

337
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,714
You have no hair! You're a monk!

338
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,884
You're that old monk's student?

339
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:29,384
Fong, come up!

340
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:36,120
Demon, take my spell!

341
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,564
Soldiers of wind and fire heed
the spell is cast!

342
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:47,942
Heaven and earth move
lend me your powers!

343
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:53,642
Wow!

344
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,574
Follow her!

345
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:05,357
Damn, she's got my sword

346
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,655
You like playing games?
I'll kill you

347
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,323
Belittling me?
Let's see who wins!

348
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:17,038
Little monk, I've been waiting
for you to save your Master

349
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:19,140
I was wondering who
you'd find to help you

350
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,400
and you get a midget

351
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:21,907
with a giant's sword

352
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,204
You want to amuse me
so I die happy?

353
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,244
Old witch

354
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:27,405
careful you'll die laughing

355
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,943
Do something quickly!

356
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,745
I haven't begun my chanting yet

357
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:32,683
Don't scare me

358
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,049
It's too late to look for a spell now!
Shut up!

359
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:37,686
Let's bet

360
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,065
Yin, chop this side first

361
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:55,040
Chop...

362
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:02,115
They keep multiplying
cast any old spell

363
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,115
What spell?
I can't even open my manuscript

364
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:05,514
I'm going!

365
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,249
Trying to escape?

366
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,725
You coward!

367
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,163
I'll help you get away
Lotus!

368
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:31,404
Come on!

369
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:35,643
I almost missed you two

370
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,616
Bastard, you ran away
you've no loyalty

371
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,755
I was sacrificing myself
to distract her

372
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:42,413
But she didn't fall for it
what can I do?

373
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:44,024
So that means I get
sacrificed instead?

374
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:48,623
Stop arguing
Let's get out of Orchid Temple

375
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,328
Let's hide

376
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,811
I can't let the
Priestess see me here

377
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:06,777
We'll work together

378
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,211
and distract him!

379
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:10,480
Hey, catch!

380
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:17,024
Going to fight me with
your little games?

381
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,327
My little games will kill you

382
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,132
Is that all you're capable of?

383
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,626
That wasn't for real

384
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:29,100
but my next move is!

385
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,771
Miraculous armour, go!

386
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,873
You decide to change
your clothes now?

387
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:41,304
I'm off

388
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,883
Trying to trick her again?

389
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,321
Let's go!

390
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,735
Priestess, you've been wounded!

391
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:04,733
How could we let him get away!

392
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,972
Did he think he could hurt me?

393
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:22,487
You won't get me!

394
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:23,716
Keep running away like that

395
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:24,859
and even if you save me...

396
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:26,289
I'll die of fright!

397
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,362
This is strategy
do you understand?

398
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,758
At least you could
have warned me

399
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:31,729
I'm saving you and all
you do is complain...

400
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,562
You still owe me money
where's the money?

401
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:38,332
Lotus

402
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:42,009
I mentioned borrowing
some money, I...

403
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,941
Not now, I've got to be
careful when I get back

404
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,139
Why don't you leave
Orchid Temple with us?

405
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:49,648
Your situation's dangerous;
don't go back...

406
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,149
Why not leave with us?

407
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,878
You can be a ghost anywhere

408
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:56,024
No, I'm used to this

409
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,748
I suffered before

410
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:00,486
I prefer living day by day

411
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:02,095
Not like you

412
00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:03,731
not knowing what tomorrow will bring

413
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:04,888
It doesn't matter not knowing

414
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:07,228
Don't try and change my mind!

415
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:08,426
Here I live well and dress well

416
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:10,196
I'm not related to you

417
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,932
What place do I have
following you around?

418
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,434
I can't talk anyone
I have to go

419
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:17,840
Forget about me

420
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:24,676
She said we don't know
where we're going

421
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,616
She's right

422
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:28,552
Let's take care of ourselves first

423
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,021
That means we forget about her

424
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,092
You said it

425
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,711
Jade, is the Priestess back yet?

426
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,647
The Priestess?

427
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:59,753
No

428
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:02,687
Then start combing my hair

429
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:05,850
If she comes back
say I never went out

430
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,802
What's wrong?

431
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,532
Nothing...
I'll miss you

432
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,974
In two days I'll marry
the Mountain Devil

433
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:29,641
Whatever happens
you're always my sister

434
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,882
I'll talk to the Priestess

435
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:35,250
someone else can marry him

436
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,449
Then we can stay together

437
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:52,236
Lotus, I really love you

438
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:53,066
I believed

439
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:54,174
that when you went out

440
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,777
you were a good girl

441
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:59,345
Tell me where they are hiding?

442
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:02,915
Priestess, forgive me
I was wrong

443
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:05,383
Forgive you?

444
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:10,422
Tell me, how should I punish her?

445
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:12,617
Jade, you tell me

446
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:19,093
Why don't we, don't we...

447
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:21,828
Marry her to the Mountain Devil

448
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,097
Jade, you?

449
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:28,369
Sold when you're alive
and sold when you're dead

450
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:31,137
That Demon has many concubines

451
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,144
You'll suffer!

452
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:37,582
You betrayed me!
Cut off her hair

453
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:47,090
What a waste of beautiful hair

454
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,730
I've spent so much
time combing it

455
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:51,866
What a waste!

456
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,831
Scissors!

457
00:24:59,141 --> 00:25:03,134
Jade, didn't you just
call me your sister?

458
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:05,542
You knew the Priestess
was hiding here

459
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,272
Why did you betray me?

460
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:10,043
For her own good

461
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:11,310
I'm going to scratch your face!

462
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,380
Priestess, please forgive me!

463
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:19,917
Please forgive Lotus!

464
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,924
Jade...

465
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,003
Sister...

466
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:31,901
Don't worry, I'll marry
in your place

467
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:34,133
Crocodile tears

468
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:38,104
But I won't let you get away

469
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,908
Let who get away?
Come here!

470
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:42,514
You're sisters!

471
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:44,879
You'll both marry the Mountain Devil

472
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:46,486
Scratch her face!

473
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,087
Priestess, don't...

474
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,088
Won't you forgive me?

475
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,228
You want me to really
damage your face?

476
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:57,024
I want her face
scratched to hell

477
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:57,722
Is this it?

478
00:25:57,899 --> 00:25:58,888
Yes!

479
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,432
Come on!

480
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,671
I'm one of you!

481
00:26:10,312 --> 00:26:11,540
Who are you?

482
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:12,880
Lotus?

483
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:14,379
Run away!

484
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,913
Don't be afraid, Buddha'll protect
us, good will win

485
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,587
You better let her go!

486
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:20,449
Hands off!

487
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,021
Or I'll blow you up

488
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,157
I'll come back and fight later

489
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:24,314
Come back!

490
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,019
I'm going to eat him first

491
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:32,064
You can lick me
but no kissing!

492
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,898
Did I save the wrong girl?

493
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,939
You'd better turn
over a new leaf

494
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,202
I will!

495
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,972
I better take you back
you can't be tamed!

496
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:51,652
I'm back!

497
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:54,681
I'm off!

498
00:26:58,593 --> 00:26:59,787
Sister, run!

499
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,429
Jade!

500
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:04,793
Jade!

501
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,938
You witch, still dare to call
my fighting 'games'?

502
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,599
Next time I'll blow up your nest!

503
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:17,374
Jade!

504
00:27:17,546 --> 00:27:19,343
We're far away from it now

505
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,845
It doesn't matter how far we go

506
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:22,449
Why?

507
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:23,811
What are you two up to back there?

508
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:27,079
My urn of ashes is in
the hands of the Priestess

509
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:29,746
Under the 1,000 year old tree
at daybreak...

510
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,620
My soul will have to return there

511
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:32,885
I promise you I'll find
your urn of ashes

512
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:33,891
Don't depend on me to help

513
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:34,824
Concentrate on flying!

514
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:36,395
Be careful!

515
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:42,568
What did you just say?

516
00:27:42,737 --> 00:27:44,068
You're going to back out now?

517
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:47,572
I do one thing, something else
happens, it never ends

518
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:48,902
So what?

519
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:50,169
I'll never be able to
work out my payment!

520
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:52,108
Add you stupidity
plus my naivete and intelligence

521
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,008
You should also add

522
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:54,409
your greediness and heartlessness

523
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,675
In the end you're
justjealous of me!

524
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:57,045
Jealous of you?

525
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,413
You two are always
in an hot embrace

526
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:00,214
I never get a chance!

527
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,152
I don't know what type of monk
you are, but I'm also human

528
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:05,122
I need love too!

529
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:06,658
I'm only doing this
to save someone

530
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:10,025
Stop fighting!
The Priestess isn't easy to handle

531
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,795
I don't think
I'll ever get away

532
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:17,299
Fong, just pretend this
never happened

533
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,302
I'll go by myself!

534
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:21,840
Stop putting it on
I won't help you

535
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,500
If you're going
to help him, move!

536
00:28:23,678 --> 00:28:24,975
Even if he begs me
I won't go

537
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:26,944
But if you beg me
I may consider it

538
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,207
Well, take your time then

539
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:29,782
Hey!

540
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:31,316
Fong, what're you going to do?

541
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:33,477
Get your urn of ashes
then save Master

542
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,459
That would be suicide!

543
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:42,563
Give yourself a break

544
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:44,422
It's none of your business!

545
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,006
Look what you've done to me

546
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:55,439
If not for you I wouldn't
be in this mess

547
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:57,841
I saved you, and you're blaming me?

548
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:01,176
You can't fight me
how can you help me?

549
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,591
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid

550
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:36,642
It's getting light
I can't stop you

551
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:40,313
No one'll help me
I'll have to help myself

552
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,723
Take care

553
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,520
I knew I'd find you!

554
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,898
So many urns!
How to find hers?

555
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,866
Let's look together

556
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,472
I don't need your help
I can't afford you

557
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,276
The likely ones go on this side

558
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,383
I wonder which one
contains Lotus's ashes?

559
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:44,813
None of your business!

560
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:48,618
Smart ass!

561
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,314
This might be

562
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,759
Or, this could be too

563
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,368
It's so big!
Lotus wasn't so fat

564
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:03,202
It goes on that side

565
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:13,480
How am I going to
carry all of these?

566
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:18,549
Want me to get

567
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,347
a horse and cart?

568
00:31:20,522 --> 00:31:22,285
Forget it, I can't afford it

569
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,551
Just for you, I won't charge

570
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:29,058
Abracadabra, show the way!

571
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,401
Look and see if it's in that urn

572
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:43,869
It really is Lotus!
We found it!

573
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:47,409
Put it away then!

574
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,274
Tree Devil, how dare you
belittle me!

575
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:51,578
I'm going to burn you up

576
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:53,084
Then let's see what you can do?

577
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:03,857
The old monk!

578
00:32:04,032 --> 00:32:05,795
I've found your Master

579
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,932
Bring him down please!

580
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,161
Okay!

581
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,439
How is he?

582
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:12,766
I can't tell!

583
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:18,672
His eyes are swollen

584
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:27,555
Master!

585
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,256
Move your Master
I'm going to burn the tree

586
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:34,788
It's raining
let's get out of the rain

587
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:37,056
If it doesn't stop
raining, we'll run

588
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:47,574
I'm angry we didn't
burn that old witch!

589
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:54,107
Master
Are your alright, Master!

590
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:02,047
Master, your eyes!

591
00:33:02,223 --> 00:33:03,690
Fong!

592
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,416
You finally made it

593
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,827
Fong, someone else is here
who is it?

594
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,194
It's me sir

595
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,027
The nice young man

596
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:16,830
you met at the market

597
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:18,029
Good, you decided to change

598
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:21,437
your ways, and join us

599
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:22,871
Yes

600
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,773
I'm not as greedy as you think

601
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,551
We should be safe here

602
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,997
There's an inn over there
we can rest awhile

603
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:45,154
Okay!

604
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,300
Wait!

605
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:47,025
Why?

606
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,635
What's the matter, Master?

607
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,178
They're here!

608
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:04,613
Who is?

609
00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:06,276
Those filthy ones!

610
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:08,319
What filthy ones?

611
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:13,994
Fong!

612
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:16,490
Lotus, it's Lotus!

613
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:17,858
Lotus!

614
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:18,623
I'll take care of her

615
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,994
Don't Master
she helped us

616
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:20,998
She's on our side!

617
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:21,692
Really?

618
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,962
Lotus, I found your urn of ashes

619
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:24,331
Hold on, there's another one

620
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:27,236
Fong...

621
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:36,811
Don't believe her
she's a fake!

622
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:44,449
Fong, don't believe her
I'm the real one

623
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,124
Which one's real?

624
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,192
How do I know?

625
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:48,556
Which is the real one, Master?

626
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,288
How should I know?

627
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:57,763
Fong, don't believe her, Fong...

628
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:08,141
Reveal yourself!

629
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,084
Stupid monk!

630
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:12,883
It's the Tree Devil!

631
00:35:13,054 --> 00:35:14,180
Lotus

632
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:17,150
Fong!

633
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,451
Fong!

634
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:26,598
How come we're still
in Orchid Temple?

635
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:27,700
We never managed to escape

636
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:29,200
the Tree Devil's grasp!

637
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,429
I know where Fong is
You must go quickly

638
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,600
Of course you know where he is!

639
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:36,368
You lied to us from
the beginning

640
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:38,205
Now you're trying to trap us

641
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,814
My soul's always been
with my urn of ashes

642
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:43,780
Like you, I was set up
by the Priestess

643
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:45,613
Rubbish, you expect me
to believe you?

644
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:46,719
I'm going to break your urn

645
00:35:46,888 --> 00:35:49,516
and disperse your spirit
so you won't do more harm

646
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:52,852
I never lied to you

647
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,860
You think I let the Tree
Devil take Fong on purpose?

648
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:59,431
Yin, don't you believe me?

649
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,567
Demon, I'm going to destroy you

650
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:07,139
Master, let's get the old one
and let this one go

651
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,339
Go!

652
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,774
Go on!

653
00:36:14,248 --> 00:36:17,376
Fong is in Orchid Temple
go and save him

654
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:25,152
Let's go

655
00:36:30,598 --> 00:36:31,860
You dropped your abacus

656
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:35,302
Forget it, I'll never make
money on this job

657
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,300
Let's go and save Fong

658
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:37,438
Right

659
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,294
Master, the devil hurt by you...

660
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:10,562
...is now recovering.

661
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:18,910
Fong!

662
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,342
Fong, where is he?

663
00:37:20,515 --> 00:37:22,278
Over there!

664
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,884
Can't you see
he's hanging up there

665
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:39,627
Little monk, I'm going to
suck your energy

666
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:42,668
Then I'll sell you to
the Mountain Devil

667
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:44,600
You'll never be able
to reincarnate

668
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:47,138
and you'll rot in hell!

669
00:37:49,577 --> 00:37:51,169
Butterfly...

670
00:37:52,714 --> 00:37:55,376
You can't even handle this monk
you're useless

671
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,417
Priestess, I can do it!

672
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,678
I'll seduce him, just you watch!

673
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:18,830
Lotus!

674
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,172
How dare you come back!

675
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,139
Priestess, I'll finish her off

676
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:26,109
No, I came for forgiveness...

677
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:27,938
I brought the other
two back with me

678
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,311
They're hiding behind the grass

679
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:32,943
Damn her, she's sold us out

680
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,254
You witch, how dare you betray us

681
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:41,327
I should've destroyed your urn!

682
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:45,830
The underworld is invincible!

683
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:57,174
Abandon law and order!

684
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,839
Heaven and earth move
lend your powers!

685
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:02,346
Stars scatter
...sword fly!

686
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,352
Cover the skies!

687
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,059
Oh my gold!

688
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:16,695
I'll hold them back!

689
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:20,730
The light of Buddha shines!

690
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:24,596
Butterfly!

691
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,203
Priestess, help me!

692
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,745
You're wounded, you're useless now

693
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:36,010
I need your energy

694
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:43,922
You old Tree Devil
you devour your own people!

695
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,956
No matter how powerful you are

696
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:48,459
Or that you're in human form
you're still a demon

697
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:52,698
Go to hell, take my spell

698
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:56,359
Soldiers of wind and fire
show your power

699
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:03,908
Why did you betray
my Master and Yin?

700
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:06,638
How else could I distract
the Priestess and save you?

701
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:11,708
My manuscript!

702
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:13,285
Stars scatter!

703
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:17,823
Heaven and earth move
lend your power

704
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:27,931
The Mountain Devil...

705
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:32,267
The Mountain Devil will
come, run quickly

706
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:34,706
You go first!

707
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:36,343
Butterfly!

708
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:38,709
Fong!

709
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,040
Come on, Lotus

710
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:41,511
Butterfly!

711
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:46,011
You were right
leave with the monk

712
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,580
At least you won't
end up like this

713
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,418
I was wrong too!
I shouldn't trust them!

714
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:54,561
Otherwise, I won't be
a wandering ghost!

715
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:57,630
Quick, help me!

716
00:40:57,798 --> 00:40:59,663
Butterfly...
Help me!

717
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,802
Butterfly!

718
00:41:03,604 --> 00:41:08,041
Let's go Lotus! Come on!

719
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:09,676
Come with your Master!

720
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,843
We can't get away like this
step on my cloak!

721
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,482
Onto my cloak

722
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,593
Master, wait for Lotus

723
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:35,201
She's a demon
don't be seduced by her

724
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:36,859
Fong!

725
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:40,662
Lotus, quickly, Lotus!

726
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:42,001
Fong!

727
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:47,511
Lotus!

728
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:57,720
Fong!

729
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,189
Fong!

730
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:02,255
Lotus?

731
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,789
Lotus

732
00:42:06,968 --> 00:42:08,902
Fong, I'm over here!

733
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,565
Lotus, your urn of ashes!

734
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,303
Old monk, your student is down here...

735
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:18,809
Don't you go back to save him?

736
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:22,107
Soldiers of fire and wind

737
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,654
come, come, come

738
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:29,820
Buddha be merciful

739
00:42:36,497 --> 00:42:37,486
Master!

740
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:39,526
Come on up

741
00:42:49,877 --> 00:42:55,907
You kill the tree devil
and I bring you all to hell

742
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,241
Mountain devil is coming!

743
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:04,588
Thank you for saving me sir

744
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:06,454
I was only trying to save my student

745
00:43:06,727 --> 00:43:08,354
Master, Lotus is really...

746
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:10,861
Forget it, there's one
hour before daybreak

747
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:12,966
Once it's light we'll be fine

748
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:21,506
Come to hell with me, you can't escape!

749
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:26,036
Master, we won't make it!

750
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,841
Yin, let's break
a path through it

751
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:33,281
Right! Heaven and earth move

752
00:43:33,454 --> 00:43:35,149
Lend your powers
The light of Buddha!

753
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,253
We won't make it

754
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:41,794
I'll use all my life
force to fight it

755
00:43:46,634 --> 00:43:47,726
Come on!

756
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:21,897
Fong, is it light yet?

757
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:23,560
Not yet, Master

758
00:44:23,737 --> 00:44:24,761
He's made the skies dark

759
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:26,372
we're in his clutches

760
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,871
You take care of the monk
I'll distract him

761
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:28,770
You're no match for them

762
00:44:28,943 --> 00:44:30,069
I'll find a way

763
00:44:30,244 --> 00:44:31,404
Yin!

764
00:44:31,745 --> 00:44:32,643
Mountain Devil

765
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:34,576
I've destroyed your
bastard sister

766
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:36,648
Are you afraid to show yourself?

767
00:44:36,817 --> 00:44:37,909
I'll destroy you!

768
00:44:38,085 --> 00:44:40,144
The spell exerts itself!

769
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:48,984
Here I come!

770
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:53,858
He's gone!

771
00:44:56,036 --> 00:44:57,264
What can you do?

772
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,682
Master
Fong.

773
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:17,153
Your body'll hold the
Gold Buddha's energy

774
00:45:17,324 --> 00:45:20,452
I'll send you above the clouds
to absorb the sun's rays

775
00:45:20,628 --> 00:45:21,754
Master, you'll bleed to death!

776
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:23,590
Concentrate!

777
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:36,673
Master, Master

778
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:37,708
Are you alright, Master!

779
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:38,970
Let me go!

780
00:45:39,146 --> 00:45:40,113
You'll die if you go up there!

781
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:42,112
If I don't, you'll all die

782
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:47,479
Monk, if I don't come back

783
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:50,488
Please bury my urn of
ashes properly for me

784
00:45:51,058 --> 00:45:55,188
Lotus, we're all depending on you

785
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,754
Lotus!

786
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:02,534
Lotus

787
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:04,834
We keep trying to be apart

788
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:07,030
Yet we end up together!

789
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:10,440
But where we're going
is not for you

790
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:13,143
I know why I've to go
don't worry!

791
00:46:14,348 --> 00:46:15,576
What're you doing?

792
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:17,842
I'm afraid I might let go of you

793
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,357
Untie yourself!

794
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,556
If I let go, you'll fall down!

795
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:32,289
Take care of yourself first!

796
00:47:03,964 --> 00:47:05,795
My eyes!

797
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:47,000
The sun!

798
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:02,387
I'm out of breath!

799
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:29,142
Wow! I fell so far
and I'm not hurt!

800
00:48:29,316 --> 00:48:31,409
Lotus

801
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:33,109
Hey, help me out!

802
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:35,882
This is what I get for being kind!

803
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:41,560
Lotus... Lotus!

804
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:42,991
Lotus!

805
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:45,358
Lotus!

806
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,660
Lotus!

807
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:53,572
It's a shame your spirit
is dispersed

808
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:55,834
Is this what one gets
for being kind

809
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:58,409
I hope good will come
to you in the end

810
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:00,069
Fong

811
00:49:05,085 --> 00:49:07,519
Lotus, Lotus

812
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:09,849
I thought I'd never
see you again!

813
00:49:12,393 --> 00:49:13,655
Take my urn of ashes with you

814
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:16,057
and I'll leave here too

815
00:49:16,864 --> 00:49:18,627
Who are you talking to?

816
00:49:22,703 --> 00:49:24,500
All that is left is
this red ribbon!

817
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,434
You mean her spirit dispersed?

818
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:28,700
Yes!

819
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,089
I must go now
hope we meet again

820
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,390
We've got to go too
bye for now

821
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:51,194
Good bye

822
00:49:55,335 --> 00:49:57,098
Let's go, Master

823
00:49:57,838 --> 00:49:59,738
Fong, why're you walking so fast?

824
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:04,868
I can't find Lotus's urn of ashes!

825
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:07,036
Really?

826
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:11,610
Lotus, let's get to know
each other better

827
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:18,017
You reap what you sow
stealing is wrong

828
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:20,752
I put the ashes inside my gourd

829
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:24,125
Fong!

830
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:29,096
Fong!

831
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:32,634
I'll find you wherever
you're gone!

832
00:50:33,373 --> 00:50:35,102
Fong, where are you taking me?

833
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:41,569
The demon said
there's no heaven

834
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:43,141
Is that true?

835
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:44,579
Stop talking and do something

836
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:45,945
Help me up!

837
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,552
Sure!
