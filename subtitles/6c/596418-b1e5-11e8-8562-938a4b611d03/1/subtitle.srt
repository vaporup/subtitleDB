1
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,593
My name is Kenji.

2
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,470
This could be me three hours from now.

3
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,919
Why do I want to kill myself?

4
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,149
I don't know...

5
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,030
I wouldn't kill myself for the same
reasons as other suicidal people.

6
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,676
Money problems...

7
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,193
Broken heart...

8
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,113
Hopelessness...

9
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,200
No, not me.

10
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,191
Many books say "Death is relaxing."

11
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,438
Did you know that?

12
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,555
No need to follow the latest trends...

13
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,552
No need to keep pace
with the rest of the world...

14
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,756
No more e-mail...

15
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,195
No more telephone...

16
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,471
It'll be like taking a nap...

17
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,269
Before waking up refreshed
and ready to begin your next life.

18
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,432
That's what they say.

19
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,195
"This is bliss."

20
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,710
Surprised!

21
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,389
Present.

22
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,075
But don't open it, it's mine.

23
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,037
Nice place...big...Not bad.

24
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,037
Sorry I didn't warn you I was coming.
I had a bit of an emergency.

25
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,868
Got any ice?

26
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,436
You don't have a TV?

27
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,990
How can you live without a TV?

28
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,031
You can't just read, you'll go crazy.

29
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,112
I can buy you a TV, and DVD too.

30
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,239
It's fucking hot!

31
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,198
Is the traffic in Bangkok always this bad?

32
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,953
Took me almost two hours to get here.

33
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,431
Can't believe you don't have a TV!

34
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,800
Suicide again?

35
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,432
Hanging yourself this time?

36
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,198
It's too hot!

37
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,113
I need a shower.

38
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,717
This heat can kill you.

39
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,516
Why bother with suicide?

40
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:55,831
"Black Lizard", by Yukio Mishima

41
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:16,430
"Out jogging. Don't answerthe phone."

42
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,196
"This is bliss."

43
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,949
Kenji,

44
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,395
Tea is getting cold.

45
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,114
Thank you.

46
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,753
I got to find a way to go back to Japan.

47
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,520
If not Japan, maybe Brazil.

48
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,788
Japan is better, fuck overseas.

49
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,678
But here you have a brother.

50
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,715
Yeah, the crazy one.

51
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,236
He reads too much.

52
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,317
You can't go back to Japan.

53
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,994
Boss will kill you.

54
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,235
But I've been with him a long time.

55
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,278
He's just in a bad mood.

56
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,710
A bad mood?

57
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,191
Yes.

58
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,918
You fucked his daughter!

59
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,910
If you fucked my daughter,

60
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:08,631
I'd cut your dick off
and stuff it in your mouth!

61
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,037
Really?

62
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,113
You've seen too many yakuza movies.

63
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,749
Kenji.

64
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,513
Ready to go home?

65
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,750
Yes.

66
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,877
Kenji.

67
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,797
This is the form forthe public.

68
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,792
This one is for staff.

69
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,871
Sorry.

70
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,512
Thank you very much.

71
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,751
Kenji.

72
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,508
I'm making sushi at home tonight.
Are you free?

73
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,797
I'm allergic to fish.

74
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,393
Sorry.

75
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,278
Thank you very much.

76
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,878
Nid?

77
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,229
Have you seen Nid?

78
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,880
She's somewhere here.

79
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,358
Nid!

80
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,278
Nid!

81
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,879
What?

82
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,076
Let's go home.

83
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,310
I can't.

84
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,155
Let's go home.

85
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,592
My client's still here.

86
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,271
I have to talk to you.

87
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,237
About what?

88
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,910
"The Last Lizard"

89
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,594
Are you Japanese?

90
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,749
Are you from Japan?

91
00:16:49,640 --> 00:17:03,429
Japan...Japan... Japanese... speak?

92
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,397
Stop fucking with the radio.

93
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,831
Nid...stop it!

94
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,835
Are you crazy?

95
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,639
Take your headphones off.

96
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,597
What the fuck...

97
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,471
Did you fuck Jon?

98
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,310
Who told you that?

99
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,715
Did you fuck him?

100
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,669
Jon told me everything today.

101
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,829
What?

102
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,388
What did that dickhead tell you?

103
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,994
Yeah, he's a dickhead. He's shit!

104
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,753
So why did you have
to go fuck a shit like that?

105
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,913
You couldn't leave him alone
because he's my shit, right?

106
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,717
Jon's such a dickhead.

107
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,475
Don't know why you care
so much about him.

108
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:35,517
I...know...Japanese. I...Japanese...

109
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,949
Getting off here?

110
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,436
Listen, Jon started it, not me.

111
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,477
That's not the point.

112
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,552
The point is you're my sister.

113
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:10,269
He's probably got his dick in some
other bitch's pussy right now.

114
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,791
Get out!

115
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,996
Out!

116
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,839
"The lizard wakes up
and finds he's the last lizard alive.

117
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,631
His family and friends are all gone.

118
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,079
Those he didn't like,

119
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,518
those who picked on him in school,
are also gone.

120
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,997
The lizard is all alone.

121
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,474
He misses his family and friends.

122
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,635
Even his enemies.

123
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,509
It's better being with your enemies
than being alone.

124
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,112
That's what he thought.

125
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,550
Staring at the sunset, he thinks.

126
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,189
"What is the point in living...

127
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,832
If I don't have anyone to talk to?"

128
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,069
But even that thought
doesn't mean anything...

129
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,199
when you're the last lizard."

130
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,591
Nid!

131
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,918
Your car is in the parking
lot out front.

132
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,110
You know my crazy brother.

133
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,790
Make yourself at home.

134
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,390
We have a lot to catch up on, Buddy.

135
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,552
Ice, ice, ice!

136
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,949
Is this a house or a library?

137
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,396
Damn -- no ashtray.

138
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,712
Cool place.

139
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,676
You moved here for girls?

140
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,599
Or boys?

141
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,472
Thanks...l'll wait till it's cold.

142
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,757
Damn it!

143
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,838
No! No! Don't kill me!

144
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,158
-Kenji, aren't you going home?
-Yes.

145
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,270
This is your bag?

146
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,988
The cop thought it's mine.
He took it into my carthen.

147
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,793
I've found your card inside.

148
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,998
So I came here to give it back.

149
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,752
Kenji, are you coming?

150
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,400
You go first.

151
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,593
Did you see a book?

152
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,235
What book?

153
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,831
No. Nothing.

154
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,469
Are you okay?

155
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,028
I gotta go.

156
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,237
Yes, me too.

157
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,273
Thank you for dinner.

158
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,636
Thank you.

159
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,271
You go home now?

160
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,199
I'm not sure.

161
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,918
You go karaoke?

162
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,834
I cannot sing.

163
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,315
You go for girl?

164
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,359
Can I go to your house?

165
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,235
My home...very far.

166
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,876
Good.

167
00:34:32,280 --> 00:35:11,999
Thai national anthem

168
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,551
Sa-wat-dee Krap.

169
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,471
What?

170
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,952
Sa-wat-dee Krap.

171
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,996
You can speak Thai?

172
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,040
O-hayo Go-zai-masu.

173
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,635
Want some pizza?

174
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,993
Not hungry? Beer?

175
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,677
My name is Kenji.

176
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,639
I know.
I saw the name card in your bag.

177
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,029
My name's Noi.

178
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,633
Noi...Nice to meet you.

179
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,439
Nice to meet you too.

180
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,313
What is your sister's name?

181
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,475
You eat.

182
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,708
Thank you.

183
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,714
Japanese lesson.

184
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,997
No eat.

185
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,353
What are you staring at?

186
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,197
Are you washing dishes? Don't do that.

187
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,238
Do you want to go home?
I can drop you.

188
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,838
I - drive - you - home.

189
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,117
Can I stay here today?

190
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,710
You sure?

191
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,477
Don't burn my house down.

192
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,788
What?

193
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,155
Nothing.

194
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,675
My sister's name -- Nid

195
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:58,236
I am home...

196
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,152
Hello.

197
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,277
Hello.

198
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,269
Who are you?

199
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,751
Who the fuck are you?

200
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,716
Hello.

201
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,674
What? Does Noi in?

202
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,398
What are you doing there?

203
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,232
Get Noi on the phone...Noi! Noi!

204
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,959
-Hallo.
-What's a fucking Hello!

205
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,273
Get me Noi.

206
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,396
All right.

207
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,675
Sorry. I'm sorry.
-Who're you? Can you hear me?

208
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,194
Hello? Hello?

209
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,754
What are you doing?

210
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,274
How dare you come in here?

211
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,115
Get out!

212
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,032
Get the fuck out!

213
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,792
Get out of my house!

214
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,348
I'm sorry.

215
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,113
Why did you leave me, Nid?

216
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,591
I'm scared...I don't want to be alone.

217
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,669
Hey, did you see a Japanese guy?

218
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,348
What are you doing?

219
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,388
I'm sorry.

220
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,474
I bought you some sushi.

221
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,232
Sushi?

222
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,834
Fucking expensive.

223
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,630
I'm sorry.

224
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,355
Okay, I know you're sorry.

225
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,593
I cannot eat fish. I get sick...

226
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,192
You don't speak much Thai, right?

227
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,435
Thank you.

228
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,188
What can you say?

229
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,479
Good luck.

230
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,072
Some more?

231
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,549
I don't want.

232
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,592
Thank you.

233
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,478
I thought you didn't want any more.

234
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,396
More Thai.

235
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,034
Too expensive.

236
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,469
I'm full.

237
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,429
Then stop eating.

238
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,069
Never mind.

239
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,953
No problem.

240
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:34,635
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...5...5

241
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,557
You are very pretty.

242
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,829
More.

243
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,473
Thank you.

244
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,397
You say that a lot, huh.

245
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,190
I'm studying Japanese.

246
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,078
Really?

247
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,755
I'm going to Japan.

248
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,912
Where in Japan?

249
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,513
Osaka.

250
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,631
Osaka!

251
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,477
When?

252
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,394
Soon...Monday.

253
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,199
This Monday?

254
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,518
Why you go there?

255
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,034
What?

256
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:48,195
What're you doing in Osaka?

257
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,759
Work.

258
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,719
Work? What kind of work?

259
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,832
Same work I do here.

260
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,037
I'm from Osaka.

261
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,992
Really?

262
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,911
You speak Japanese well.

263
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,558
No...

264
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,358
When you want to go home?

265
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,196
You go to hospital?

266
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,235
Hospital?

267
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,072
For your sister?

268
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,151
No.

269
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,637
Hello...

270
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,951
No. Nothing...

271
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:58,036
Just a friend. Friend, understand?

272
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,075
No, don't come. I'm going out.

273
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,158
Why do I have to tell you everything?
This is my life!

274
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,029
If you want to talk shit,
don't call anymore.

275
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,670
No go home?

276
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,712
This house is very dirty.

277
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,999
You want to stay, stay.

278
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,470
Go to hell.

279
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,914
1,375 Baht.

280
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,909
Why am I cleaning the house
when I'm leaving in a few days?

281
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,712
I knew it...

282
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:01,033
The bitch blew me off this morning.

283
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,475
This is beautiful.

284
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,994
Why you not go home?

285
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,719
It smells too bad.

286
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,911
What?

287
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,360
My house smells bad.

288
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,998
Smell bad? Why?

289
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,431
Two dead people inside.

290
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,555
We should clean your house then.

291
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,997
It sounds great...around here.

292
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,397
No. It's boring!

293
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,630
You have sister?

294
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,991
Brother.

295
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,072
In Osaka?

296
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,071
Dead.

297
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,991
We are same. My sister's dead too.

298
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,079
You miss your sister?

299
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,393
Sometimes.

300
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,630
You miss your brother?

301
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,030
No, not really.

302
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,318
Did you fart?

303
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,958
Fart?

304
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,355
Fart?

305
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,590
You fart?

306
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,476
You fart?

307
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,915
Not me!

308
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,788
That hurts...

309
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,428
Let's go home.

310
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,948
Hey--Jap boy.

311
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,512
Hey--Jap boy.

312
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,637
Are you upstairs?

313
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,394
Jap boy.

314
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,072
Nid, I'm sorry.

315
01:06:50,224 --> 01:06:53,102
Thanks for cleaning the house.

316
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:54,902
What?

317
01:06:56,464 --> 01:06:59,024
Thank you very much.

318
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:01,141
You're welcome.

319
01:07:01,224 --> 01:07:03,943
Tomorrow we'll do the laundry.

320
01:07:09,184 --> 01:07:11,778
Bon appetite.

321
01:07:21,824 --> 01:07:24,213
You no go home?

322
01:07:26,464 --> 01:07:28,739
Can I stay here more?

323
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:34,813
Do what you want. I leave here soon.

324
01:07:54,424 --> 01:07:57,496
Tonight you sleep in bedroom.

325
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:58,733
And you?

326
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,860
I sleep here, in sofa.

327
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:03,504
No. I sleep here.

328
01:08:03,744 --> 01:08:06,304
You sleep in the bedroom.

329
01:08:16,904 --> 01:08:19,418
You can sleep in my sister's bed.

330
01:08:19,504 --> 01:08:21,176
What?

331
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:25,542
You can sleep in my sister bed.

332
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:32,856
That jerk did!

333
01:08:49,704 --> 01:08:51,342
Are you married?

334
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:52,937
No.

335
01:08:53,024 --> 01:08:54,662
You have girlfriend?

336
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:56,496
No.

337
01:08:57,824 --> 01:08:59,576
Are you gay?

338
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:04,775
You masturbate a lot?

339
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:06,538
What?

340
01:09:06,624 --> 01:09:11,459
You masturbate a lot?

341
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:21,100
Let's go out.

342
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:22,936
Where?

343
01:10:39,184 --> 01:10:41,254
Shut up old man!

344
01:11:31,824 --> 01:11:38,093
Hey, come sit here.

345
01:13:11,744 --> 01:13:15,783
You saw my book, in the bag?

346
01:13:15,864 --> 01:13:17,775
What?

347
01:13:18,984 --> 01:13:24,980
Two days ago, my book...in my bag.

348
01:13:25,064 --> 01:13:27,532
What book?

What do you want?

I don't miss you.

361
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:23,653
But what if I miss you?

362
01:17:24,184 --> 01:17:25,776
Go fuck yourself, then.

363

I told you; don't be rude!

367

This'll teach you some manners.

368
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:19,817
So, this is your new fuck?

I give you my car.

375
01:20:48,624 --> 01:20:50,376
Why?

376
01:20:51,544 --> 01:20:54,661

I give you license too.

381
01:21:27,344 --> 01:21:30,142
You look strange.
It doesn't look like you.

01:26:56,664 --> 01:26:58,894
I'm not sure.

406
01:27:21,224 --> 01:27:23,897
Goodbye Nid.

Everybody is sad.

"This is bliss."

462
01:42:58,864 --> 01:43:02,095
Noi, someone's here to see you.
