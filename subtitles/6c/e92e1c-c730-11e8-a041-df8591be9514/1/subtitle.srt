1
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,567
MagnaVolt.
The final word in auto security.

2
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,529
No embarrassing alarm noise,
no need to trouble the police...

3
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,997
...and it won't even
run down your battery.

4
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,500
{y:i}Magna Volt.

5
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,545
{y:i}Lethal response.

6
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,675
{y:i}On the international scene, the Amazon
{y:i}nuclear power facility has blown its stack...

7
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:36,388
...irradiating the world's largest rain forest.
Environmentalists call it a disaster.

8
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,599
But don't they always?

9
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,685
In national news,
Attorney General Marcos today...

10
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:46,815
...approved the ED 209 combat unit
for deployment in five American cities...

11
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,068
...despite widespread complaints
of malfunction.

12
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,737
The surgeon general is dead.

13
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:56,074
Gunned down 20 minutes ago by a militant
addict of the deadly designer drug Nuke.

14
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:00,412
The greatest health threat
facing our nation.

15
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,793
Nuke.

16
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,380
The most addictive narcotic
in history.

17
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,758
A plague that...

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,641
Nuke! Nuke!

19
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,523
This station has just received
this transmission from Cain...

20
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,692
...convicted murderer
and leader of the Nuke cult.

21
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,152
The people want paradise.

22
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,782
And they will have it.

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,244
{y:i}The assassination is the latest
{y:i}act of terrorism by Cain...

24
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:45,082
{y:i}... following the bombing
{y:i}of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.

25
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,920
After the latest breakdown in negotiations,
Detroit's police returned to the picket line...

26
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,674
...demanding better terms from
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

27
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,719
...the corporation contracted by the city
to run the police department.

28
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:02,307
OCP cut our salaries 40 percent
and canceled our pensions.

29
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,143
Now they refuse to even talk to us.

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,479
God knows why,
but they want this strike.

31
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,519
What happened?

32
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,967
Get up!

33
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,555
- Hold him!
- You put my eye out, you bitches!

34
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,724
Shut up, you fuckhead!

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,269
- You're breaking my fucking arm!
- Hurry!

36
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,233
Look at this. What a nasty man.

37
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,278
Night's made. Let's pay Papa
and get us what we need.

38
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,239
Nuke me, baby!

39
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,285
- I'll kill you bitches!
- He's up! Come on!

40
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,502
- You're shit with a timer, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

41
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,597
I'll take out an army with this shit!

42
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,477
Let's load up
and get the hell out of here!

43
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,821
Where's the bullets for this gun, man?

44
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,866
Third drawer, bottom.

45
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,799
We should've brought a truck!

46
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,516
I really like this gun, man.

47
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,185
Just take it and get out.

48
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,686
Thanks.

49
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,151
- I don't believe this!
- What?

50
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,070
- It's the cops, man.
- Cops are on strike, stupid.

51
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,239
Can't you hear that?

52
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,835
- See. What did I tell you?
- I'll fix him.

53
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,016
Did you see that? We got him!

54
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:35,187
- Beautiful. Come on, man. Let's move it.
- No. One more!

55
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,399
Nice shit, man.

56
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,027
Fucking cops!

57
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,416
Peace officer.

58
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,919
Think it over, creep.

59
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,560
Nuke.

60
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,063
It's not mine, man.

61
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,483
Where is it made?

62
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,737
It's not mine, man. I told you! I'm clean!

63
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,284
Where is it made?

64
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,788
I don't know, man!
All I know is where I get it!

65
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,891
Freeze.

66
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,936
Nobody move. This is a bust.

67
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,833
Ladies, stay down.

68
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,816
Somebody! Open the fridge, damn it!

69
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,195
Come on!

70
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,262
Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?

71
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,232
{y:i}Can't shoot a kid...

72
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,568
{y:i}Throw it home, Dad!

73
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,956
Shut up!

74
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:14,419
Drop it or the little shit's dead!
I'll blow its fucking head off, man!

75
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,255
Lewis...

76
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,257
...hang it up.

77
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,766
Now, no shit from either one of you!

78
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,977
- And don't try to follow me!
- We won't.

79
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,645
The baby's going with me!

80
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,648
I'll kill it, man. I'll do it. I'll fucking kill it!

81
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,067
We can't have that.

82
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,832
Nice shooting.

83
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,879
See you, Jimmy.

84
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,147
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

85
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,061
Don't do it! No! Stop... Stop it, Alex!

86
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,380
{y:i}OCP defines you as a machine...

87
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,844
...that utilizes some living tissue.
You understand that.

88
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,929
Yes.

89
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,434
And so do you
consider yourself human?

90
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,605
I require an answer.

91
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,317
Stop tape.

92
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,447
You have any idea what you're doing
to that poor woman?

93
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,492
Take a look at her file.

94
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,077
Go on.

95
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:57,249
Officer, Mrs. Murphy
is bringing suit against OCP.

96
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,043
My name is Tom Delaney.
I'm representing her.

97
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,422
Up to a few months ago,
she wouldn't leave her bedroom.

98
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,425
Then there were hypnotists
and harmonic treatments.

99
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,554
Then you pull this shit!
Driving past her house day after day.

100
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:14,224
Spying on her. Trying to make her
think her husband is still alive.

101
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,227
She's barely started
to accept the loss.

102
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,731
- You're ripping her to pieces.
- And for what?

103
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,151
Do you think you could ever be
a husband to her?

104
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,946
I mean, what can you offer her?

105
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,157
Companionship?

106
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,619
Love?

107
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,705
A man's love?

108
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,764
No.

109
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,100
Roll tape.

110
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,774
Are you Alex Murphy?

111
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,778
No.

112
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,279
Are you human?

113
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,949
No.

114
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,701
You are simply a machine.

115
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,121
I am...

116
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,374
...a machine.

117
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,417
Nothing more.

118
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,837
Nothing more.

119
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,551
That'll do it. Stop tape.

120
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,516
Now, you stay there.
All right, go get her.

121
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,853
Let's be decent about this.
Give them some privacy.

122
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,897
I don't have a problem with that.

123
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,661
Alex?

124
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,039
Don't you know me?

125
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,753
Don't you remember me?

126
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,383
Alex, it doesn't matter
what they've done to you...

127
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,553
Touch me.

128
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,439
It's cold.

129
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,275
They made this...

130
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,236
...to honor him.

131
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:19,827
- No, l...
- Your husband is dead.

132
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,081
I don't know you.

133
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,485
Why is this happening?

134
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,463
I thought all communication systems
were the same.

135
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,800
I tried to save the company
a few bucks.

136
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:21,513
It took two days to download specs
from Cleveland.

137
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,267
I lost the account.

138
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,377
It hardly befits my dignity
to have to come to you, Johnson.

139
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,214
Sorry for the slight inconvenience,
Your Honor.

140
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,633
Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight.

141
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,843
Not when you're mayor of a major city!

142
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,639
When will you start paying the cops
so they'll go back to work?

143
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,557
We're not a charity.

144
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,976
The city owes us over $37 million.

145
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,647
- You'll have to cut us some slack.
- A deadline's a deadline. Sorry.

146
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,274
How are we supposed to raise
that kind of money?

147
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,151
You aren't.

148
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,280
- What the hell is he talking about?
- We don't expect you to pay.

149
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,699
Let me refer you to our contract.

150
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,036
"In the event of default...

151
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:30,916
...OCP shall have the uncontested right
of foreclosure on all city assets."

152
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,962
You signed this.

153
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,923
We miss one payment,
and you can foreclose?

154
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,925
We can and we will.

155
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,469
We're taking Detroit private.

156
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,222
So you deliberately undermined
our credit.

157
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,599
That was the easy part.

158
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,936
And you engineered the police strike.

159
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,313
You want Detroit to tear itself apart...

160
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,483
...so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation!

161
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,694
Do you know how many people
are dying?

162
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,112
You're murderers!

163
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,198
I'd advise you to say nothing further.
It might be...

164
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,616
...actionable.

165
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,368
It's bullshit!

166
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,705
- Bullshit, you senile, old bastard!
- All right, calm down.

167
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,957
- We better get out of here.
- I'm okay!

168
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,209
- Calm down. We better leave.
- I'm calm.

169
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,503
- Calm down. Easy.
- I'm okay.

170
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,005
All right, good.

171
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:21,175
- I'm in control. Everything is fine. It's okay.
- Relax.

172
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,302
I'm fine.

173
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,429
One last thing, gentlemen.

174
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,264
We will sue your asses.

175
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,308
Give it your best shot.

176
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:33,187
Fuck you, you old, senile bastard!
This is bullshit!

177
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,980
Fuck you!

178
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,691
- This is bullshit!
- Calm down.

179
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:45,491
I've been very patient, Johnson.
Five months.

180
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,452
- Who's that?
- That's Dr. Juliette Faxx.

181
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,163
Just moved up to head the
Attitude Adjustment team.

182
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,292
Five months. Ninety million dollars!

183
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:01,173
- I want to see some results.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you what we have.

184
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,594
{y:i}OCP pioneered cyborg technology.

185
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,430
{y:i}And now we take
{y:i}a quantum leap forward.

186
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,849
{y:i}State-of-the-art
{y:i}destructive capabilities...

187
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:15,771
{y:i}... commanded by a unique combination
{y:i}of software and organic systems.

188
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:18,357
{y:i}In every way,
{y:i}an improvement over the original.

189
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:23,070
{y:i}It gives me great pleasure
{y:i}to introduce to you, Robocop 2.

190
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,834
{y:i}You are under arrest.

191
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,587
{y:i}Stop or I'll shoot.

192
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:44,258
{y:i}Stop or I'll shoot.

193
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:57,187
{y:i}OCP is proud to present the future
{y:i}of urban pacification:

194
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,022
{y:i}Robocop 2.

195
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,751
Ninety million.

196
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,047
They all go crazy.

197
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,592
Robots with emotional problems.

198
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,219
No, sir, not robots, cyborgs.

199
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:33,640
Cybernetic organisms. We use living human
tissue and that's our whole problem.

200
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,894
The candidates were all fine men,
respected police officers.

201
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,021
I reviewed their files myself.

202
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:43,650
Sir, police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes.

203
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,445
They're a physical bunch.
They're macho, body-proud.

204
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:50,073
Stripped of all that it's no wonder
they become suicidal.

205
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,451
Our one success was a cop.

206
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,078
Well, yes, Mr. Johnson. Alex Murphy.

207
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:58,207
Top of his class,
devout Irish Catholic, family man.

208
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,543
Everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty.

209
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,545
That's probably what kept him alive.

210
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:07,466
With due respect, Dr. Faxx,
your area of expertise is psychology.

211
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,967
Not robotics.

212
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,262
There's no harm in hearing
the young lady out, is there?

213
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:13,639
No, sir.

214
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,768
Thank you, sir. I believe that Murphy's case
was unusual but not unique.

215
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:22,439
We can find someone else, someone
to whom the prospect might even be...

216
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,982
...desirable.

217
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,320
I've never met anyone who wanted
to be a robot.

218
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:32,449
It would require a screening process,
one I'd would be happy to supervise.

219
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,284
The cost would be negligible.

220
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:38,956
It would be a shame
to waste all the work that's been done.

221
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,958
It certainly would.

222
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,126
Go to it. Report to me directly.

223
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,838
Yes, sir.

224
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,758
You could learn a thing or two
from that girl, Johnson.

225
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,431
- Not for me!

226
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,686
Decent pay to decent cops!

227
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,861
Union's got a list!
We ain't forgetting who you are!

228
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,529
One at a time!

229
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,368
Please, one at a time.

230
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,416
Don't you know
what's going on out here?

231
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,336
It's the best we can do!

232
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,798
Hello, ladies!

233
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,805
They won't be fucking
with any more cops!

234
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,516
They won't be fucking
with nobody, man!

235
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,015
Hob. That's him.

236
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:23,810
Thank you.

237
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,399
Nuke me!

238
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,322
Go ahead. Take two.

239
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,367
There's plenty of Nuke to go around.

240
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,620
I've lost him.

241
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,580
You haven't been around in a while.

242
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,916
Go ahead. This one's on me.

243
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,460
Five degrees south-southwest.

244
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,838
There's the little darling.

245
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,422
Good eyes, Murphy.

246
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,675
Good as money can buy.

247
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,593
Ferdy, you got out.

248
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,137
Well, I'll tell Cain, okay?

249
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,984
Better have something
to give me this time, officer.

250
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:18,365
One cop per car.
Okay, these are the routes.

251
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,034
Three cars.

252
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,995
- One cop per car?
- That's right.

253
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:27,457
Sitting ducks. We set up three
snipers and that's all it takes.

254
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,378
- Pay the man.
- All right.

255
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,796
Thank you.

256
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,090
- You didn't count it.
- That's all right.

257
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,301
You should really count it, you know.

258
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:38,844
It's okay.

259
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,055
Give him something
to help him with his conscience.

260
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,644
No, that's all right. I don't really want it.

261
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,147
Come on, Duffy. I know you need it.

262
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,543
Isn't this a school day?

263
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,300
Cops!

264
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,554
Oh, shit!

265
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,772
Oh, no.

266
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,792
Freeze!

267
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,045
Turn around. Put your hands up.

268
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,728
Shit.

269
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,787
Officer Duffy, have a seat.

270
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,754
You look a little out of breath, bitch.

271
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:45,637
- You sold us out, Officer Duffy.
- What are you talking about, Murph?

272
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:48,515
Where is Cain?

273
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,351
I don't know any Cain.

274
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,606
Where is Cain?

275
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,150
I don't know.

276
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,576
Where is Cain?!

277
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,204
I told you, I don't know!

278
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,771
Where?

279
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:38,482
River Rouge. The old sludge plant.

280
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,027
You're a rotten cop.

281
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,826
Go.

282
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:50,275
- You.
- You want me?

283
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:52,110
Dead or alive.

284
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,322
Then one of us must die.

285
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,783
Dead, then.

286
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,392
Jesus...

287
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,602
...had days like this.

288
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,523
Hounded and attacked like a criminal.

289
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,943
But like him, I don't blame you.

290
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,696
They program you, and you do it.

291
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:41,076
- I will kill you.
- Oh, you just tried.

292
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:43,954
And...

293
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:45,455
...I forgive you.

294
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,030
Why'd you stop? You got it cracked.

295
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,406
I'm tired.

296
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,409
They say he's got a brain.
I want to see it.

297
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,709
You think it was me that beat you?

298
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,878
It wasn't.

299
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:16,755
It was this.

300
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:34,898
It's too tough.

301
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,484
Try here at the joint.

302
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:44,658
Yeah!

303
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:50,789
Look at that!

304
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,509
Come on. Cut it out.

305
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:07,431
How's it taste?

306
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:21,195
What the hell's going on?!

307
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,281
Man, just look at him.

308
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,202
Christ, he's been stripped.

309
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:44,927
Let's not get carried away here.
We're talking about a piece of equipment.

310
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,346
Don't tell me he can't suffer.

311
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,640
Just look at him.

312
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,351
It's electrical.

313
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,228
Bullshit.

314
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:57,356
I know every inch of him.
Every circuit.

315
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,525
Every living nerve.

316
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:03,654
His pain centers are alive.
They're lit up like Christmas trees.

317
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:06,698
The back-up generator's
just making him twitch.

318
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,408
He's suffering.

319
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,494
How long can he last?

320
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,371
No way of knowing.

321
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,207
Got him on minimal life support.

322
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,419
Keeping the brain going
with microshocks.

323
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:25,259
- It's damn tricky. He could go anytime.
- Move. Move!

324
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,345
What's happening in here?

325
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:33,016
OCP is happening. These bastards
won't lift a finger to help him.

326
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:36,061
This unit needs
millions of dollars in parts.

327
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:40,232
You can't expect authorization for that
kind of cash overnight. Be reasonable.

328
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,192
If you don't fix him, it's murder.

329
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:45,195
Settle down. I'm doing you
a favor by talking to you.

330
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,949
You son of a bitch. He's in hell.

331
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,620
Fix him!

332
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,623
We'll be in touch.

333
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,925
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest!

334
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:09,094
Did you see their faces?

335
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:12,389
"We're gonna throw away
the key, Duffy."

336
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,602
The cops didn't give you trouble,
did they?

337
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,522
The usual shit from Reed.
They'll never prove anything.

338
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,274
Hey, want some?

339
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:25,861
Hey, I'm a minor.
Don't want to break any laws.

340
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:28,447
Here, you take it.

341
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,949
God, I just love you guys!

342
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,122
What happened?

343
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,374
Hey, where we going?

344
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:43,086
Hey, come on, guys.
This isn't funny, man.

345
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:44,963
Oh, God, my head.

346
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:48,342
My head is killing me.

347
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,303
Hey, man. What's?

348
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:54,932
Hey, Cain! Hey, it's good to see you.

349
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:56,725
Thanks for getting me out.

350
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,854
- I can't get up.
- You noticed that one.

351
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,566
- Cain, I don't know what the kid told you...
- You told them, Duffy.

352
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,069
- You told them where we were.
- That's not true.

353
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:11,990
- We know all about it, Duffy.
- You think you're the only cop we have?

354
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,245
Oh, shit!

355
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:19,081
Cain. Cain, come on.
Man, I'm begging you, man!

356
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:21,583
Look, I'll do anything!

357
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,753
Okay. You're kidding, right?
Yeah, you're just kidding.

358
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:29,007
You scared me.
You taught me a lesson, man.

359
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,427
I'd never fuck with you,
because I really love you guys.

360
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,596
- I really do!
- Shut up!

361
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:39,059
I've been loyal. I know shit
that I still haven't even told you, Cain!

362
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:43,564
You deserve this, Duffy.
Cain might have been killed.

363
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,065
Okay. Okay.

364
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,943
Maybe you ought to have the kid leave.

365
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:52,406
- Why?
- What do you mean, "have the kid leave"?

366
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,244
That's a good touch. That's a good touch.
"Have the kid leave."

367
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:01,915
That's good. "Have the kid leave." Why?

368
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,170
Come on. It's over.

369
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:09,756
Come on, Cain! Come on, man.
What are you doing?

370
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:12,968
Come on!

371
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:30,611
You said you were
just gonna scare him!

372
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,779
Doesn't he look scared?

373
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,250
I can't believe you'd do this.

374
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:48,420
It hardly matters what you believe,
Mr. Schenk.

375
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:51,381
But these are criminals.
They're maniacs.

376
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,593
You're giving premature
value judgments.

377
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,389
All right, it may be true.
The subjects are socially misaligned.

378
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:02,518
Socially misaligned?
These are death row inmates!

379
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:06,271
And of no use to society. We need a
subject who'll welcome the power...

380
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,315
...the virtual immortality we offer.

381
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:12,277
Now, I really think this is a good place
to start looking.

382
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:18,075
- You're out of your mind.
- Is that your professional opinion?

383
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,119
Yes, goddamn it, it is! Yes!

384
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:25,707
And you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg.

385
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,751
We'd dearly miss you here.

386
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,297
You're the one that's gonna be
out of a job.

387
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,843
I'm going to take this directly
to Johnson.

388
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:40,681
He's just been waiting for an excuse
to get you fired.

389
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:50,232
Good morning, sir.

390
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,777
I'm sorry to bother you this early.

391
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:56,655
You seem agitated.

392
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,074
Frankly, I'm shocked.

393
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,160
Mr. Schenk just called.

394
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,997
Dr. Faxx has begun screening
candidates for the Robocop 2 project...

395
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,834
So I understand. It's very exciting.

396
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:12,004
She's screening psychotics, sir.
Murderers.

397
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:15,090
We aren't planning to build a toy,
Johnson.

398
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:16,675
Faxx knows what she's doing.

399
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:20,637
She's keeping Robocop offline.
It's a public-relations disaster.

400
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:24,683
You've got to learn to look
at the larger picture. The foreclosure.

401
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,977
You must know how important
that is to us.

402
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:30,981
With Robocop out of commission, the
chaos down there will increase...

403
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,859
...and the odds the city will fall
into our hands.

404
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:38,655
But a competent executive would find a way
to deal with the corporate image problem.

405
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:41,408
Couldn't agree with you more,
Mr. Johnson.

406
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,620
Fortunately, I have found a way.

407
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:48,332
Yes, Ms. Faxx and I have
already discussed it.

408
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:53,212
I know you'll help
to implement her ideas.

409
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:55,255
Of course, sir. Whatever I can do.

410
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,673
Anything else?

411
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:59,927
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

412
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,804
Don't forget your shoes
on the way out.

413
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:38,465
He's my patient and critical.
I must stay with him.

414
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,467
We'll let you know when we need you.

415
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:43,720
Nobody on your staff has my experience
with him. You need me.

416
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,389
We don't need anybody.

417
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:48,809
"We." Who the hell are "we"?
You're a lawyer who knows nothing!

418
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,728
You're exactly this far
from getting fired, babe.

419
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:54,106
Shyster!

420
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:56,942
He's one of mine.

421
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,653
I want him back on his feet.

422
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:03,448
Maybe he will be,
or maybe we'll just sell the parts for scrap.

423
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,325
That's up to us.

424
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,870
You see, Robocop's off warranty.

425
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,292
Robocop's command program...

426
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,837
...his set of directives...

427
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:21,300
It determines his behavior.
It's time to update the program...

428
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:25,137
...and I would like to hear
from each one of you.

429
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,473
It's about time they asked us.

430
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,727
We're getting a lot of heat
from parents' groups.

431
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:34,146
Personally, I don't blame them.
I'm a parent.

432
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:36,440
All that destructive behavior.

433
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,651
He's become a role model
for our children.

434
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,404
- Now, what are we teaching them?
- You have a point.

435
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:45,824
If he talked things out with people
instead of firing that gun.

436
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,828
Couldn't he take a little time
to address environmental issues?

437
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,079
What was that?

438
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,624
He could speak out
on environmental issues.

439
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,292
Don't see any reason why not.

440
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,085
For all the shooting he does...

441
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:00,506
...l've never once seen him take the time
to do anything nice...

442
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:05,093
...like visit an orphanage.
- You're absolutely right.

443
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,803
Or help a cat out of a tree...

444
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,681
...or go door to door collecting
for the Red Cross...

445
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,520
...or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some Cub Scouts.

446
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:20,025
Why, Mr. Johnson, that is wonderful.
Thank you so much.

447
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:28,450
- It's no good. The program isn't uploading.
- He's resisting.

448
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:29,868
There's too much data.

449
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:34,206
- No, it's him. Leave him to me, Schenk.
- I can't... It's not going to work!

450
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:37,334
You're wasting valuable time.

451
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,379
- Don't resist us.
- Let me up.

452
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,840
I must go.

453
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,009
Go where?

454
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:51,765
Do what? Go dancing? Fall in love?
What is it you think you are?

455
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,976
Alex Murphy.

456
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:56,979
That's a delusion.

457
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:01,150
It's a glitch in your system.
Alex Murphy is dead.

458
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,903
Take away the metal and wires,
you're just a couple chunks on a table.

459
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,156
You're not even a corpse.

460
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:10,951
What are you?

461
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:14,830
Respond.

462
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:19,501
I am Officer Alex Murphy...

463
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,253
...Detroit Police Department.

464
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,921
That won't do.

465
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,722
What are you?

466
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:38,061
Robocop. Crime Prevention Unit.

467
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,897
OCP.

468
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:42,733
Better. Much better.

469
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:47,905
I type it. You think it.

470
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:51,492
You type it. I think it.

471
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:54,912
What a wonderful opportunity
you represent.

472
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:57,873
Psychotherapy, it's such a...

473
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:03,212
It's a slow, clumsy practice.
But with you this is so simple.

474
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,130
Direct.

475
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,680
You're lucky.

476
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:17,726
We can do in moments with you what
would take years with a human patient.

477
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:21,188
I'm really very lucky.

478
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:25,609
You're free. You're free from doubt.
Free from having to make painful choices.

479
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,488
I am free.

480
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:32,157
He's ready.

481
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,369
Uploading command program.

482
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:42,084
I am so glad we had this chance
to dialogue.

483
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:56,098
Look at you. It's like you're brand-new.

484
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,683
Thank you. Thank you.

485
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,893
You really had us worried there, Murphy.

486
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:01,436
I'm touched.

487
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,313
Get this guy.

488
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:05,566
He's touched.

489
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:10,571
That's enough. All of you,
back to your posts. Come on. Let's go.

490
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:15,784
How you feeling, Murphy?

491
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:19,496
I'm just fine, Warren.
Thank you for asking.

492
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,874
Let's get you downstairs.

493
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,460
I want to see what those amateurs
at OCP screwed up.

494
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:29,006
Pity. It's a beautiful morning.

495
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:31,300
Shame to waste it.

496
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,470
- Ready for duty, partner?
- You betcha.

497
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,140
- Let's go.
- Nothing I'd rather do.

498
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:41,935
He sounds terrific.

499
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,645
Something's wrong.

500
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,257
Harder!

501
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:27,898
It's Robo!
Everybody out the back door!

502
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,528
- It's locked!
- It won't open!

503
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,159
Murph, wake up, will you?

504
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,044
Good morning.

505
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,134
Come on, take him out.

506
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,392
I think we should talk.

507
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,356
What's with you, Murph?

508
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,074
- Where'd they go?
- "Where'd they go?"

509
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:23,537
They're still here,
the little bastards!

510
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:26,832
Hands up! Let's go! Everybody up!

511
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,918
Move it. Up against the wall.

512
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,087
Let's go.

513
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:43,265
Hands on top of your heads.
Nobody move.

514
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:46,059
You are under arrest.

515
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,604
You have the right to remain silent.

516
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:52,274
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

517
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:55,235
...in a court of law.
- He's dead, Murphy.

518
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:58,489
- You have the right...
- You're reading Miranda to a corpse!

519
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:06,455
I'm having trouble.

520
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,841
Oh, my.

521
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:21,553
This isn't very nice.

522
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,766
Though you may think
you're having fun now...

523
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:29,269
...you only hurt the one you love.

524
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,523
Think of Mom and Dad.

525
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:35,067
What kind of lesson are
you teaching them?

526
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,487
And now, a word on nutrition.

527
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:40,697
Shit! He's fucked up!

528
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,451
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

529
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:45,953
Let's go!

530
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,663
The point is...

531
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:50,249
...we all have to work.

532
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,751
I haven't finished.

533
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:56,213
Hit the gas, Murphy.

534
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,675
The posted limit is 35.

535
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:02,261
We should set an example, Anne.

536
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,933
Your hair looks lovely that way.

537
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,894
It's OCP. They did something to you.

538
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,563
I'm fine.

539
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,361
Isn't the moon wonderful tonight?

540
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:21,530
It's still daytime.

541
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,032
It's the thought that counts.

542
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:28,245
Oh, Jesus, we're heading back
to the station. That's all there is to it.

543
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,512
What the hell are you doing?!

544
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:47,806
Waste makes haste...

545
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,976
...for time is fleeting.

546
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:55,063
A rolling stone is won'th
two in the bush.

547
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:57,483
Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck!

548
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:03,197
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

549
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:04,865
You're nuts!

550
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,580
Murphy, come on, let's go.

551
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:14,958
Come on!

552
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,425
Back!

553
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,852
Thank you for not smoking.

554
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,198
Well, there it is. It's OCP.

555
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:48,408
They screwed him up.

556
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:51,078
He must be going out of his mind.

557
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,705
It's not as if he can just say no.

558
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:58,919
They put all this nonsense
into his brain. He has to obey.

559
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,004
Take them out, all of them!

560
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:03,715
Can't be done,
not with this equipment.

561
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:07,052
Are you saying there's no way?
I can't believe that.

562
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:10,389
Sure, there are ways.
You can pull his cranial circuits.

563
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,891
Which would shut down
his life-support.

564
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:16,311
You could run a few thousand volts
through him.

565
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:18,564
Probably kill him.
