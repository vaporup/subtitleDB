1
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:09,092
Well, there it is. It's OCP.

2
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,294
They screwed him up.

3
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:13,967
He must be going out of his mind.

4
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,607
It's not as if he can just say no.

5
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:21,805
They put all this nonsense
into his brain. He has to obey.

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,916
Take them out, all of them!

7
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:26,609
Can't be done,
not with this equipment.

8
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:29,948
Are you saying there's no way?
I can't believe that.

9
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:33,286
Sure, there are ways.
You can pull his cranial circuits.

10
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,792
Which would shut down
his life-support.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,227
You could run a few thousand volts
through him.

12
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,463
Probably kill him.

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,273
I'll get some help!

14
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,985
- Get him inside!
- Come on, move it!

15
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,282
- Come on!
- Don't touch him, he's hot!

16
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,049
Use your jackets.

17
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:54,454
Why'd he do that?

18
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,425
Fried himself to get rid
of OCP's crazy commands.

19
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,529
- Nice and easy.
- He weighs a ton.

20
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,266
Out of the way! Move out!

21
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,109
- Think he's alive?
- I don't know. He's pretty hot.

22
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:18,579
Put me down.

23
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,751
All right. Come on, stand him up.

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,831
Are we cops?

25
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,771
What's bugging you, Murph?

26
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,569
Cain.

27
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:47,913
Cain's bugging me.

28
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:51,545
We have only just begun, my flock.

29
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:54,482
Soon we will expand from city to city.

30
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:57,122
The rich and poor alike
will know a paradise...

31
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,293
...for every moment of their lives.

32
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:03,658
This is a Nuke for every mood.

33
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,455
We'll offer the opportunity...

34
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:09,294
...to control every aspect
of their emotional lives.

35
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,971
Here with the white noise
and black thunder...

36
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:15,630
...and the red ramrod
and the blue velvet.

37
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:18,572
Frank. The blue velvet.

38
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,610
I think it's ready, sir.

39
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,448
Thank you, Frank.

40
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:43,663
Frank. The Benzedrine's
got my teeth wiggling.

41
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,929
Cut it with scopolamine.

42
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:48,737
- Five mils per.
- Yes, sir.

43
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,344
Made in America.

44
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:56,345
Yeah. We're gonna make that
mean something again.

45
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,147
- Hey! Cops!
- What?

46
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:04,653
Cops!

47
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:08,558
And they ain't carrying
no picket signs!

48
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,290
They're going to kick somebody's ass!

49
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,078
Give me your hand, goddamn it!

50
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,117
Christ!

51
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,623
Fuck.

52
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,726
Fuck!

53
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,061
Get out!

54
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,198
Bomb! Get down!

55
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,611
You son of a bitch!

56
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,928
Five hundred million in cash.
Nuke money seized by police.

57
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:55,130
But State Attorney Sphincter won't let
the bankrupt city government touch it.

58
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:59,501
Coming up next, threats from the police
union and cheers from the public...

59
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:04,115
...as Metro-North cops go back to work
and apprehend the Nuke lord, Cain...

60
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,615
...who may not live to stand trial.

61
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:14,357
They say 20 seconds
in the California sunshine...

62
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,488
...is too much these days...

63
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,230
...ever since we lost the ozone layer.

64
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:25,427
But that was before Sunblock 5000.

65
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,864
Just apply a pint...

66
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,770
...to your body...

67
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:34,175
...and you're good for hours.

68
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:37,907
See you by the pool.

69
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,417
<i>Sunblock 5000.</i>

70
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:51,027
<i>Protection for the new age.</i>

71
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,755
Subject is violently antisocial...

72
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:57,459
...given to delusions of godhood.

73
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,362
And he's hopelessly addicted
to narcotics.

74
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,033
Which offers us a simple
and infallible method...

75
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:08,544
...of insuring his obedience.

76
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,220
You're perfect.

77
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:20,248
I must have you.

78
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:27,356
What are you talking about?
It's like you don't even care!

79
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,502
- Just do what I say, Angie!
- He'd want us to come for him!

80
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:34,264
Forget about it! It's not gonna happen!
I'm through arguing with you!

81
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:38,808
I'm not asking permission! Cain is
in the hospital, and we're getting him.

82
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:42,607
You've really thought this out, haven't you?
What about the cops?

83
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,248
We've got guns!

84
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,147
- Damn it, Hob, Cain needs us!
- Fuck Cain!

85
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:52,182
- He'd kill you if he heard you.
- He's not gonna kill anybody!

86
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:55,486
- Shit, he's probably dead already.
- You just shut the hell up!

87
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:59,461
You mouth off like that again,
and it's no more Nuke for you, bitch.

88
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,226
Damn it, Hob, you know that's not fair.

89
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:05,969
Now, come on.

90
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:09,707
- It's been a bad time.
- Sure has. You're really hurting.

91
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,642
Yeah, so I'm hurting.

92
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:14,404
You're gonna get the shakes soon, Angie.

93
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,378
You got it bad.

94
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:20,051
You little bastard.

95
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,581
You just do what I tell you
from now on, Angie.

96
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,590
Start the motor and drive.

97
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,160
He'll kill you.

98
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,101
He'll kill us both.

99
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,764
Fuck him.

100
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,088
Oh, you're a mess.

101
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,759
I got good news for you.

102
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:05,193
You're going to have a chance
for immortality.

103
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:09,294
As long as nothing happens
to that lovely brain.

104
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,478
Dr. Weltman? It's Faxx.

105
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,581
I'm afraid we lost our patient.

106
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,310
Yeah, he just expired.

107
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:31,112
Contact the organ harvest team. We've got
six minutes before the brain's useless.

108
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,594
Night.

109
00:13:56,783 --> 00:14:00,048
Come on. Let's move it.
We've only got five minutes.

110
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:02,719
Lock it up.

111
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,363
Move the screen in closer.
I can't read it.

112
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,101
- How'd we get this one?
- Well, Faxx found him.

113
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,971
He volunteered.

114
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:21,902
Volunteered?

115
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,769
Big-hearted guy.

116
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,501
Yeah, it's not the heart
we're after, though.

117
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:32,215
Speaking of hearts, how's Ilene?

118
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,613
Christ, does everybody know?

119
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:01,104
All right, hold your breath.

120
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,975
Showtime.

121
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,783
It's nice and clean in here.
There's no damage.

122
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,455
Here we go.

123
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:15,924
Easy.

124
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:20,530
We got it. Here it comes.

125
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,301
- Thing of beauty.
- Excellent.

126
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:26,631
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm hungry.

127
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,578
Thank you!

128
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,013
Yes!

129
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,777
Spider Baby Stalirski!

130
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:52,480
He's come out for Detroit,
and now you come out for him.

131
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,889
The lines are open,
waiting for your pledge.

132
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,029
If you want an honest government...

133
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,788
<i>...that works for you...</i>

134
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,266
<i>...I'm asking you to dig deep
into your pockets.</i>

135
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:08,405
<i>I'm asking you to give...</i>

136
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:11,473
<i>...whatever you can spare!</i>

137
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,304
Where does that put us?

138
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,175
Hi. Yes, ma'am.

139
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:22,251
Hello! This is Mayor Kuzak!

140
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:25,490
<i>Could you turn down your set, please?</i>

141
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,090
Your Honor...

142
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:34,464
...I have some very good news for you.

143
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,691
I think...

144
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:39,200
...the city is saved.

145
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,106
Now...

146
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:45,072
...you listen very carefully.

147
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,947
It's no bluff.
Someone's shown up to bail the city out.

148
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:52,049
- A rival corporation.
- The mayor isn't saying.

149
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:55,880
And whoever it is is taking great
pains to keep their identity secret.

150
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:59,888
They're paying in cash and they're not
moving the money through the banks.

151
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:02,458
Thank you, councilman.

152
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,857
That will be all.

153
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,629
You know, once you guys take over...

154
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:12,770
Your services to OCP
will be rewarded.

155
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,867
If the city can pay,
we'll be humiliated.

156
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,571
It's worse than that. We've shifted
80 percent of our resources...

157
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,978
...to the urban pacification plan.

158
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:31,020
If we can't foreclose, public confidence
in OCP will plummet, so will our stock.

159
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,552
Sir?

160
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,289
If I may?

161
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:36,324
There's another option.

162
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:41,357
We certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor.

163
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:44,897
It all depends how far
we're willing to go.

164
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:48,898
If anything went wrong...

165
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:51,036
As I said, sir...

166
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,508
...it all depends how far
we're willing to go.

167
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:57,274
We have no legal recourse.

168
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,084
There must be no witnesses.

169
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:11,729
You've gone too far! Give me...

170
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:13,495
Your blood pressure.

171
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,363
Get me fired if you want to.
You're not bringing illegal drugs to my lab!

172
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,700
I'll do worse than get you fired.
Now leave me alone!

173
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,008
Such terrible pain.

174
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,851
You don't remember me.

175
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,324
But you do remember this, don't you?

176
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:52,671
And we have it.
All the Nuke you'll ever need.

177
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,410
Not so fast.

178
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,547
I need you to do something
for me first.

179
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,519
Then the pain stops.

180
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,621
Good boy.

181
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:33,871
I don't like this. I think we'd better
get out of here while we can.

182
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,842
I know what I'm doing.

183
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:09,140
If you have any cash,
put it in your shorts.

184
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:11,407
That's just plain rude.

185
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,355
I wonder if any of you could help me.

186
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,556
I'm looking for a Mr. Hob.

187
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,029
So...

188
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,197
...how much you need?

189
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:34,637
Money, I mean.

190
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:37,968
Well, our current debt to OCP is...

191
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:43,112
$37,480,911 dollars.

192
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,813
Guess you're in some pretty deep shit.

193
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,112
We need all the help we can get,
young man.

194
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:50,949
Tell you what. Put me down for 50,
just to make sure.

195
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:55,093
- 50 cents, 50 dollars. That's cute.
- Don't be a queer.

196
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:57,492
Fifty million.

197
00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:00,187
This is bullshit.
Let's get out of here.

198
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,356
Good God.

199
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,523
Gentlemen?

200
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:37,630
Well, will 50 do it?

201
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:43,132
Oh, yes. That'll do it.

202
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:45,742
- Don't you guys think that'll do it?
- Yeah.

203
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:48,880
Fifty mil. That will do it.

204
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:51,912
- That'll do it.
- These people are criminals!

205
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:53,482
Why do you have to label people?

206
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:55,882
- I hate labels!
- You shut up.

207
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,567
We cannot capitulate
in the war on crime.

208
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:29,170
I'd be voted out of office.
I don't think anyone wants that.

209
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,341
War on crime is fine with us.

210
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:34,240
It's business we're talking about here.

211
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:36,776
Do you have any idea
how many people we employ?

212
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,347
No. I never thought
about it like that.

213
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:41,643
Sharp kid.

214
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,247
So...

215
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,444
...your war on crime...

216
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:47,317
...you want to win it or what?

217
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:50,750
We're the only chance you have.

218
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,724
Listen to him.

219
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:54,658
He's got it all worked out.

220
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:02,837
Why do people do crimes?

221
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:07,973
- Why? Drugs. People do drugs.
- Because they want drugs.

222
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:10,510
The kind that cost too much.

223
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:14,047
Nuke gives high quality
at a cheap price.

224
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,549
If you get off our backs,
we'll make it cheaper.

225
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:17,742
And safer.

226
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:20,320
We don't shove our shit
down anybody's throat.

227
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:24,085
And we don't advertise it
like they do with cigarettes or booze.

228
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:26,125
So leave us alone...

229
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,127
...and anybody who wants it gets it.

230
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:33,293
So no more crimes.

231
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:37,198
You get to be the mayor
who cleaned up Detroit.

232
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,512
He's got a point.

233
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,379
Don't you think he's got a point?

234
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,554
Yeah, he's got a point.

235
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:58,527
What the hell is that?

236
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:09,800
Get out!

237
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:16,839
Marv, are...?

238
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,401
Cain.

239
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,442
Oh, wow.

240
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:06,078
You look great.

241
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:07,541
It'll take some getting used to...

242
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:12,471
...but it'll be great, Cain.

243
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,558
Lie still.

244
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,665
- I'm cold.
- You are going into shock.

245
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:27,769
I will call for a medical emergency unit.

246
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:30,341
Wait. No.

247
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:33,945
Don't leave me.

248
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:38,744
I won't leave you.

249
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:45,656
Who did this?

250
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:47,625
It was big.

251
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:50,562
Bigger than you.

252
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:52,829
It was Cain.

253
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:56,639
I'm gonna die.

254
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:01,566
You know what that's like, don't you?

255
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,236
It really sucks.

256
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:13,078
Yes.

257
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:38,004
<i>Thirteen dead in what appears
to be a Nuke money massacre.</i>

258
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:41,274
<i>Among the victims,
two city councilmen.</i>

259
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:44,647
<i>Was the city trying to strike a deal
with the drug lords?</i>

260
00:33:44,854 --> 00:33:47,914
No comment!
I said, I have no comment!

261
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:50,058
No comments on these allegations.

262
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,252
These were men
who served this city tirelessly.

263
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:57,661
However, I make a promise
to the people of Detroit City...

264
00:33:57,867 --> 00:34:01,064
...that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly!

265
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,068
But, Mr. Mayor, what about...?

266
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:05,764
I'm sorry. No more questions.

267
00:34:05,975 --> 00:34:08,000
<i>Our own Mayor Kuzak.</i>

268
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:09,872
<i>Now let's go live to Jess.</i>

269
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,107
And here it is, the Civic Centrum, OCP's
100-story gift to the Motor City.

270
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:18,311
While debate continues
over OCP's hostile takeover...

271
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:21,082
...there's no denying
the mood down here is festive.

272
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:24,749
Citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope...

273
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:29,125
...that OCP will make good on its
promise of a better life in Detroit.

274
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:31,357
- Press!
- Sorry, folks, media only.

275
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:33,729
TV and press only.
You'll have to step back.

276
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:43,740
There he is!

277
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,346
Can OCP bring industry
back to Detroit?

278
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:55,115
Does OCP own the city?
Will you hold elections?

279
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:58,590
- Do we become OCP employees?
- Why not go to City Hall?

280
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:00,285
Just a minute.

281
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,695
I'll answer that, young lady.

282
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:07,495
City Hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption.

283
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,898
You get that?

284
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:13,008
This magnificent structure will be the seat
of leadership for the new Detroit.

285
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:16,441
And what better place
for a clean, fresh start?

286
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:19,672
And so, people of the press...

287
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:21,577
...city officials...

288
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,981
...in a few minutes
Omni Consumer Products...

289
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:27,952
...and the troubled city of Detroit...

290
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:31,957
...will join in a bold new venture.

291
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:34,152
Now I'd like to explain...

292
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:36,229
...just what this will mean.

293
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:39,094
Sometimes we just
have to start over...

294
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,633
...from scratch...

295
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,668
...to make things right.

296
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:46,506
And that's exactly
what we're going to do.

297
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:49,277
We're going to build
a brand-new city...

298
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,743
...where Detroit now stands.

299
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:53,882
An example...

300
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,710
...to the world.

301
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:17,900
My friends...

302
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:21,305
...welcome to our city
as it should be.

303
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:25,378
And as it will be,
in the hands of responsible...

304
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:27,776
...private enterprise.

305
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:30,942
And a special welcome...

306
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:34,487
...to Mayor Kuzak
and the outgoing administration.

307
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,590
We're not going anywhere.

308
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:38,590
Your Honor.

309
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:44,057
You'll have to tear down a lot
of houses to make that.

310
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:45,996
I mean, take away their homes!

311
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:49,228
We're going to raise towers
of glass and steel.

312
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:53,205
Every citizen will have a living unit,
safe, secure, and clean.

313
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:54,876
Now, please take your seat.

314
00:36:55,077 --> 00:36:57,204
Won't be much room for neighborhoods.

315
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:59,574
Not like the kind we all grew up in.

316
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:02,774
Today neighborhoods are places
where bad things happen.

317
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,180
Don't be nostalgic.

318
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:07,447
What about democracy?
Nobody elected you.

319
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:10,023
Anyone can buy OCP stock...

320
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:12,786
...and own a piece of our city.

321
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:15,993
What could be more democratic
than that?

322
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,659
There's a lot of people in this town
that can't afford to buy your stock!

323
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,031
And they won't let you
get away with this.

324
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:25,407
You haven't been following the polls.

325
00:37:27,176 --> 00:37:28,734
Sit down.

326
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:32,914
Sit down, mayor.

327
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:38,979
About a year ago
we gave this city Robocop.

328
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:41,486
I think he's worked out pretty well.

329
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,989
But things have become
rougher out there.

330
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:47,128
And now we need
a law enforcement unit...

331
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,594
...able to meet the enemy
on his own ground...

332
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:52,597
...and carrying enough firepower...

333
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:55,202
...to get the job done.

334
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:02,001
Ladies and gentlemen...

335
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:03,940
...with great pleasure...

336
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,770
...I give you...

337
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:08,143
...Robocop 2.

338
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:20,128
- Those bastards are maniacs!
- What's the matter?

339
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:23,230
I can't believe it.
It was them! They sent it!

340
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:24,865
Sent what?

341
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,629
Nothing.

342
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:29,202
There going to be a big call
for this unit.

343
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:31,566
And we'll make him right here in Detroit.

344
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:34,709
That means jobs
we can all be proud of.

345
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,038
And make "Made in America"...

346
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:39,578
...mean something again.

347
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:44,644
This single container...

348
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:47,982
...holds enough Nuke
to addict a city block.

349
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:51,255
A hundred of these
are produced every day...

350
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:52,860
...and sent to sweatshops...

351
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:55,997
...where urban slaves
prepare this poison...

352
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:59,224
...for our friends, our loved ones,
our children.

353
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:00,959
Now, I say...

354
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,435
...it's high time
we put an end to this plague.

355
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,736
Robocop 2 will seek out
every laboratory...

356
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:12,108
...every dealer,
and rid our city of Nuke.

357
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:17,682
Yes.

358
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:21,050
Things will be a lot quieter
with this boy around.

359
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:39,070
- What's wrong with him?
- It's nothing.

360
00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:41,766
- Nothing at all.
- Turn him off.

361
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:44,106
I can't.

362
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:46,577
Cain! Let's step outside.

363
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:52,344
You! Get out of here!
You're obsolete!

364
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,113
That thing is a killer!

365
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,748
- It's not even armed! It's harmless!
- It's a killer, and I saw it!

366
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:16,343
- Take her out of here! Now!
- Let me go!

367
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:39,957
Behave yourselves!

368
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:31,577
- What's the deal here?
- Christ knows. Sounds like a war in there.

369
00:42:45,294 --> 00:42:48,161
You're coming with me, Cain.

370
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:48,472
There he is!

371
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:03,689
- All right, get back!
- Are you jealous of the replacement?

372
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:57,082
This could look bad for OCP, Johnson.

373
00:45:57,686 --> 00:46:00,484
Scramble the best spin team we have.

374
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:12,627
Ammo! Ammo!

375
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:34,271
Get down!

376
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,266
Hold your fire!

377
00:47:57,873 --> 00:48:00,433
Hold your fire, damn it!

378
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:24,097
Let's get him out of here.

379
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:29,734
Watch his neck. He's hurt bad. Easy.

380
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:37,339
Shit!

381
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:40,070
I gotta get back.

382
00:48:40,282 --> 00:48:42,307
Move it back! Move it back!

383
00:48:57,533 --> 00:48:59,933
Let's give him what he wants.

384
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:01,951
Goodbye.

385
00:51:34,156 --> 00:51:36,488
It's serious trouble.
So many dead and wounded.

386
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:38,683
There won't be trouble from the dead.

387
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:41,055
They'll have relatives. They always do.

388
00:51:41,263 --> 00:51:44,232
- It'll be a feeding frenzy.
- It's only money.

389
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,458
- What about criminal proceedings?
- Well...

390
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:50,502
...we're looking at major indictments, sir.
Prison terms.

391
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:53,300
- What about me?
- You know we'll do whatever we can.

392
00:51:53,508 --> 00:51:55,339
- That's not good enough.
- Sir?

393
00:51:55,544 --> 00:51:57,808
What if this was the work
of one individual?

394
00:51:57,979 --> 00:52:01,915
A person who had her own agenda, wasn't
in sync with the goals of our company?

395
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:04,847
Well, that usually works.

396
00:52:05,354 --> 00:52:07,788
A woman who was not a team player.

397
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:10,583
Who violated our trust.

398
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:14,023
Easy, easy.

399
00:52:14,529 --> 00:52:16,019
Well...

400
00:52:16,231 --> 00:52:18,665
...we'd need some evidence
to support that.

401
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:21,598
Sir, whether it exists or not,
I know I can find it.

402
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:24,795
She did choose the brain, sir.

403
00:52:26,308 --> 00:52:28,538
- Good thinking.
- Sir.

404
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:30,871
Thank God you're all right.

405
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,378
I was worried. I thought
it was going to hurt you.

406
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,642
It's over. It's all over.

407
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:39,509
I failed you.

408
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:43,555
Don't be hard on yourself.
Everything's going to be all right.

409
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:50,324
Johnson, that business
we were talking about.

410
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:52,399
Get right on it.

411
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:58,072
Yes, sir.

412
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:05,704
Just look at what they've done.
They are criminals.

413
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:08,645
OCP won't own this city for long.
And I'll see to that.

414
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,216
I'll take it to the streets
and the people.

415
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,785
What has it come to?

416
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:15,650
Businessmen can buy our rights
like stock?

417
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:17,916
You don't realize what we're losing!

418
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:21,990
- Right here, sir!
- Give us a statement!

419
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:25,894
Dozens are dead.
Is this your idea of a better life?

420
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:29,935
- Was this an experiment of some kind?
- He was crazy. How did it happen?

421
00:53:30,138 --> 00:53:34,040
- Did you build it to take control?
- How do you account for this disaster?

422
00:53:34,242 --> 00:53:37,405
Will OCP make reparations
to the victims?

423
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,614
That son of a bitch
is getting away with it.

424
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:42,681
We can't even touch him.

425
00:53:44,186 --> 00:53:45,949
Patience, Lewis.

426
00:53:47,522 --> 00:53:49,422
We're only human.
