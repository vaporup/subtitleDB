1
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,280
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,481
So, what do you want to hack for, Bickle?
I can't sleep nights.

3
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:39,281
- There's porno theaters for that.
- I know. I tried that.

4
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,879
So what do you do now?

5
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,780
Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

6
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,879
Figured if I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

7
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,479
Wanna work uptown nights,
South Bronx, Harlem?

8
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,779
- I'll work anytime, anywhere.
- Will you work Jewish holidays?
Anytime, anywhere.

9
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:03,379
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

10
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,378
<i>- Give me one cab.
- How's your driving record?</i>

11
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,578
It's clean, real clean, like my conscience.

12
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:14,779
Are you gonna break my chops?
Got trouble with guys like you
breaking my chops.

13
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,579
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches. Understand?

14
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,978
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.

15
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,577
- Physical?
- Clean.

16
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:26,377
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

17
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:27,977
Education?

18
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:29,777
Some.

19
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,377
<i>Here, there, you know.
Hey, Horowitz!</i>

20
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:37,577
Military record?

21
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,677
Honorable discharge...

22
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:42,076
May 1973.

23
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:45,176
- Were you in the army?
- Marines.

24
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,976
I was in the Marines, too.

25
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:54,677
So what is it? You need an extra job?

26
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:58,475
Are you moonlighting?

27
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:03,275
I just want to work long hours.
What's moonlighting?

28
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:08,775
Look, just fill out these forms and
check back tomorrow when the shift breaks.

29
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,274
<i>O'Brien, please step up.</i>

30
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:15,675
Take the car out to 58th Street, please,
'cause it's crowded on 57th.

31
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:28,574
All right, I'm coming down there.

32
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:30,074
Let's go.

33
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,871
<i>May 10.</i>

34
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,771
<i>Thank God for the rain
which has helped wash away...</i>

35
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:18,970
<i>the garbage and trash off the sidewalks.</i>

36
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,070
<i>I'm working long hours now.</i>

37
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,271
<i>6:00 in the afternoon
to 6:00 in the morning...</i>

38
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,171
<i>sometimes even 8:00 in the morning.</i>

39
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,070
<i>Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.</i>

40
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,470
<i>It's a long hustle, but it keeps me real busy.</i>

41
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,070
<i>I can take in $300, $350 a week...</i>

42
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,870
<i>sometimes even more
when I do it off the meter.</i>

43
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:05,269
<i>All the animals come out at night.</i>

44
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,468
<i>Whores, skunk pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.</i>

45
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:13,668
<i>Sick, venal.</i>

46
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:21,368
<i>Someday a real rain'll come
and wash this scum off the streets.</i>

47
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:33,066
<i>I go all over. I take people to the Bronx,
Brooklyn, I take them to Harlem.</i>

48
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,766
<i>I don't care. Don't make no difference to me.</i>

49
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:40,166
<i>It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.</i>

50
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,866
<i>Don't make no difference to me.
Driver, 48th and 6th please.</i>

51
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:47,266
Man, you're a gorgeous, brown,
beautiful little girl.

52
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:55,566
- I can't afford to get stopped anywhere.
- No, we wouldn't want that to happen.

53
00:06:55,866 --> 00:07:01,164
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
if you do the right things.
You got a way.

54
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,865
Yeah, now you're talking.

55
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,265
Driver, hurry up, will you?

56
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:12,064
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

57
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:49,362
<i>Each night when I return the cab
to the garage...</i>

58
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:52,762
<i>I have to clean the come off the back seat.</i>

59
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:59,562
<i>Some nights I clean out the blood.</i>

60
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,259
Can I help you?

61
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,160
Yeah, what's your name?

62
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,259
- My name is Travis.
- That's nice. What can I do for you?

63
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,460
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

64
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,358
Give me a break.
You can tell me what your name is.
I'm not gonna do anything.

65
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:55,258
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to, I'm just asking...

66
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,658
- Troy!
- All right, okay.

67
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,957
Can I have a chuckles there?

68
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:08,958
You have any jujubes? They last longer.
I'd like to get some.

69
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:11,358
What you see is what we got.

70
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,658
I'll take these.

71
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,457
Coca-Cola.

72
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:29,156
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

73
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:32,856
$1.85.

74
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:58,455
<i>Twelve hours of work, and I still can't sleep.</i>

75
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,555
<i>Damn!</i>

76
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:02,955
<i>The days go on and on.</i>

77
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,554
<i>They don't end.</i>

78
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:09,454
<i>All my life needed
was a sense of some place to go.</i>

79
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:14,454
<i>I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.</i>

80
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:19,254
<i>I believe that someone should become
a person like other people.</i>

81
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:25,654
<i>I first saw her at Palantine Campaign
Headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.</i>

82
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:28,854
<i>She was wearing a white dress.</i>

83
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,753
<i>She appeared like an angel.</i>

84
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:34,353
<i>Out of this filthy mess...</i>

85
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:36,753
<i>she is alone.</i>

86
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,052
<i>They cannot...</i>

87
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,852
<i>touch her.</i>

88
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:58,651
Yes, well...

89
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:03,051
you delivered two boxes.
I think it's a total of 5,000 campaign buttons.

90
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:07,751
Now, on all the ones we had before,
our slogan is "We are the people"...

91
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:12,051
and "are" is underlined.
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

92
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:14,550
That reads "We are the people."

93
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,051
Well, I think there's a difference.

94
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:20,849
"We are the people" is not the same as
"We are the people."

95
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,850
Let's not fight.

96
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,350
Look, we'll make it real simple.

97
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,049
We don't pay for the buttons.
We throw the buttons away, all right?

98
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:32,950
Come here a minute.

99
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:35,849
What?

100
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:48,049
This canvas report is ready. If Andy okays it,
send copies to headquarters...

101
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,249
I got to get that New York Times
article Xeroxed. That has to be...

102
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:53,849
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget. Look...

103
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:56,547
We have to emphasize
the Mandatory Welfare Program.

104
00:11:56,647 --> 00:12:00,247
- That's the issue that should be pushed.
- First push the man, then the issue.

105
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:05,048
Sen. Palantine is a dynamic man.
An intelligent, interesting, fresh...

106
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:08,348
- You forgot sexy.
- I did not forget sexy.

107
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:11,347
Listen to yourself.
You sound like you're selling mouthwash.

108
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:15,247
- We are selling mouthwash.
- Are we authorized to do that?
Very funny.

109
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:18,647
We can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

110
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:21,247
My uncle's in jail because of that.

111
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:25,747
It's not really jail.
Living with his wife, anything would be jail.

112
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:28,246
- Look over there.
- I love you.

113
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,646
- Notice anything?
- No.

114
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,746
- Put your glasses on.
- Okay. Just a minute.

115
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:37,445
- All right.
- That taxi driver's been staring at us.

116
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:50,344
- What taxi driver?
- That one. The one that's sitting there.

117
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:54,445
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know, but it feels like a long time.

118
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,644
- Does he bother you?
- No.

119
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:59,345
You really mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

120
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,645
- You're quick. You're really quick.
- I try to be real quick.

121
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,345
Tell you what.
I'll play the male in this relationship.

122
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:08,944
- I'll go out...
- Good luck.
And tell him to move.

123
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:13,743
- And I don't need good luck. Thank you.
- Yes, you do. You just think you don't.

124
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:25,742
You're blocking our doorway.
You think you might wanna move the cab?

125
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,936
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

126
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:13,337
lipstick, rouge.
Not rouge. "Blush-on" they call it.

127
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:17,637
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah. It's blush-on.

128
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,436
- Travis!
- Wiz.

129
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:25,036
That's blush-on. My wife uses it.

130
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:28,036
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

131
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:33,236
A cup of coffee, please.
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it, you know.

132
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:35,535
Then perfume, the spray kind.

133
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,435
Get this.
In the middle of the Triborough bridge...

134
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:41,735
and this woman is beautiful,
she changes her pantyhose.

135
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:43,434
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:46,634
- What did you do?
- I threw the meter, you know.

137
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:51,434
I jump in the backseat, whip it out,
and I say, "You know what this is?"

138
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:56,135
She says, "It's love." I'm gonna
fuck her brains out. She goes wild.

139
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:59,335
And she said, "It's the greatest
single experience of my life."

140
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:03,134
She gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

141
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:06,834
Travis, you know Doughboy, Charlie T?

142
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,733
Hey, Travis, got change for a nickel?

143
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,433
We call him Doughboy
'cause he'll do anything for a buck.

144
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:17,633
So, how's it hanging?

145
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,132
What's that?

146
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:30,432
I just heard on the radio some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

147
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:34,132
- Stickup?
- No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.

148
00:16:34,232 --> 00:16:38,432
- Cut half his ear off.
- Where?
They said 122nd Street.

149
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,432
Fucking Mau Mau land.

150
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:47,730
You run all over town, don't you?

151
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,730
Travis?

152
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,131
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

153
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:04,730
I mean,
you handled some pretty rough customers.
Yeah, I have.

154
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,130
- You carry a piece?
- No.

155
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,029
- You need one?
- No.

156
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,130
If you ever need one, I know a fellow
who can get you a real nice deal.

157
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,030
Lots of shit around.

158
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,630
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

159
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,029
But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.

160
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:35,628
I'm gonna go do my dirt.

161
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:38,428
Travis.

162
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:41,528
Look.

163
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,928
A piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

164
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:47,128
Dig the symbols.

165
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:50,828
"F-4-0-5-4-3-4"

166
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:53,728
The watermark.

167
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:55,827
There's one person.

168
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:59,627
There's two persons,
and there's three persons.

169
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:02,026
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

170
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:06,226
Why don't you take it? If you can sell it,
you give me half of what you got.

171
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,226
I don't want it.

172
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:11,326
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

173
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,626
- I'm terribly sorry.
- What now?

174
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:32,526
- Nothing!
- That's very cute. Thank you.

175
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:35,125
Hey, you want to see something?

176
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:38,724
Wait. I just typed,
"You want to see something?"

177
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:42,124
- What?
- lf you had...

178
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:47,224
these three fingers missing on this hand
and that hand missing on that hand...

179
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:52,623
how would you light a match?
- I wouldn't light a match.
- Go ahead, give it a try.

180
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:58,124
Well, I don't think I could do it.
No?

181
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:01,524
It's gonna be difficult. I'll give it a try.

182
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,023
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

183
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:16,222
Just a minute.

184
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:25,021
I can't do it.

185
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:29,622
- The guy at the newsstand can do it.
- I don't work at a newsstand.

186
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:32,622
- He's probably Italian.
- No.

187
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,421
- You sure he's not Italian?
- He's black.

188
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,822
If he had been Italian,
he might have been a thief.

189
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:39,221
They do that.
The mob does that a lot of times.

190
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,121
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

191
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,921
I'll tell you something else.
It's like a joke, but true.

192
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:48,021
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

193
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,520
- Apparently it's symbolic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

194
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,420
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.

195
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,720
You got to catch a pigeon.
A canary, you can walk into a pet store.

196
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,120
As long as you pay for it, boom.

197
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,119
Kill it right there. Put it on anyone you want.
Doesn't matter.

198
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:32,017
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you over here.

199
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:35,217
I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind.

200
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:41,018
Why do you feel that
you have to volunteer to me?

201
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:45,117
Because I think you are
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

202
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:50,718
Thanks. But what do you think of Palantine?

203
00:20:56,617 --> 00:21:00,916
Charles Palantine, the man you're
volunteering to help elect President.

204
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:04,916
I'm sure he'll make a good president.
I don't know his policies...

205
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:07,515
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

206
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:11,215
- You want to canvass?
- I'll canvass.

207
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:13,915
How do you feel about
the Senator's stand on welfare?

208
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:18,615
I don't know the Senator's stand on welfare,
but I'm sure it's a good stand.

209
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:21,215
- Are you sure of that?
- Yeah.

210
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:26,815
We all work together here full-time,
day and night.

211
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:30,215
If you would step over there,
I'm sure the gentleman will sign you up.

212
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:33,715
I drive a taxi at night, so it's hard for me...

213
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,114
to work in the day.

214
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:43,213
Then what exactly do you want?
Would you like to come
have some coffee and pie with me?

215
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:44,714
Why?

216
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:47,313
Why? I'll tell you why.

217
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:50,713
I think you're a lonely person.

218
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:54,814
I drive by this place a lot,
and I see you here.
I see a lot of people around you...

219
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:59,613
and I see all these phones
and stuff on your desk.
That means nothing.

220
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:05,513
Then I came inside and met you...
I saw in your eyes,
I saw the way you carried yourself...

221
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:07,913
that you're not a happy person.

222
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:13,513
I think you need something.
If you want to call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

223
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:16,912
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

224
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,112
What do you say?

225
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:34,511
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

226
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:42,811
Five minutes. That's all.
Just outside, right around here.

227
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,811
I'm there to protect you.

228
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,109
Come on. Just take a little break.

229
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,309
I have a break at 4:00, and if you're here...
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

230
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:03,409
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

231
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:06,709
- All right. 4:00 p. m?
- Right.

232
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:12,608
- Outside, in the front?
- Yes.
Okay. My name is Travis. Betsy?

233
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:15,508
- Travis.
- Yeah.

234
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,409
I appreciate this, Betsy.

235
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:35,607
<i>May 26, 4:00 p.m.</i>

236
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,907
<i>I took Betsy to Child's Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.</i>

237
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:44,706
<i>I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.</i>

238
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:47,706
<i>I think that was a good selection.</i>

239
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:52,207
<i>Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.
But she could've had anything she wanted.</i>

240
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:58,506
15,000 volunteers in New York alone
is not bad...
but, Christ, the organizational problems.

241
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:02,406
I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

242
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:07,105
I got to get organized.
You know, little things
like my apartment, my possessions.

243
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:12,405
I should get a sign saying,
"One of these days I'll get organezized."

244
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:15,605
- You mean organized?
- "Organeziezd."

245
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:18,705
Organeziezd. It's a joke.

246
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:22,505
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

247
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:27,104
You mean organezized
like those office signs that say "thimk."

248
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,505
Do you like the place you work in?

249
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:40,604
We've got some good people
working for us...
and I think Palantine's got a good chance.

250
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:46,303
You know, you have beautiful eyes.

251
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:55,802
- Do you like the guy you work with?
- He's okay.

252
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:00,503
Yeah, but do you like him?

253
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:03,203
He's funny, and he's very good at his job.
He's okay.

254
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:08,102
- Though he does have a few problems.
- I would say he has quite a few problems.

255
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:11,802
His energy seems to go in the wrong places.

256
00:25:12,502 --> 00:25:15,202
When I walked in
and saw you two sitting there...

257
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:19,901
I could tell by the way you both related
there was no connection whatsoever.

258
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,601
And I felt when I walked in
that there was something between us.

259
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,601
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

260
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:29,201
So that gave me the right
to come in and talk to you.

261
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:32,501
Otherwise, I never would have felt
I had the right to talk to you...

262
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:36,600
or say anything to you.
I never would have had the courage
to talk to you.

263
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,000
With him, I felt there was nothing,
and I could sense it.

264
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,900
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

265
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,000
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

266
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
- Where are you from?
- Upstate.

267
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,499
That fellow you work with, I don't like him.

268
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,899
Not that I don't like him.
I just think he's silly.

269
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,999
I don't think he respects you.

270
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:12,498
I don't believe I've ever met anyone
quite like you.

271
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:27,298
You wanna go to a movie with me?

272
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:32,797
- I have to go back to work.
- I don't mean now. Like another time?

273
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,796
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

274
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:44,996
- What?
- That song.

275
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:49,596
By Kris Kristofferson.

276
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:54,596
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

277
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:58,496
He's a prophet and a pusher.

278
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:02,696
Partly truth, partly fiction.
A walking contradiction.

279
00:27:04,596 --> 00:27:08,296
- You saying that about me?
- Who else would I be talking about?

280
00:27:08,396 --> 00:27:10,894
I'm no pusher. I never have pushed.

281
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:15,495
No, just the part about the contradictions.
You are that.

282
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,892
<i>I called Betsy again at her office,
and she said...</i>

283
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:52,492
<i>maybe we'd go to a movie
after she gets off work tomorrow.</i>

284
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:55,092
<i>That's my day off. At first she hesitated.</i>

285
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:58,492
<i>But I called her again and then she agreed.</i>

286
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:04,191
<i>Betsy. No, Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name again.</i>

287
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:07,491
<i>Damn. I got to remember stuff like that.</i>

288
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:20,391
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

289
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,191
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

290
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,590
until things start coming in from California.

291
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,890
This is just making me nervous.
We should have waited for the limo.

292
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,990
I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind going
to California without preparing right.

293
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:36,690
- That's gonna get us in trouble.
- Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?

294
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,790
Yes, I am.

295
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,390
I'm one of your biggest supporters.

296
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:48,090
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
that they have to vote for you.
Why, thank you...

297
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:50,489
Travis.

298
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:53,889
I'm sure you're gonna win, sir.
Everybody I know is gonna vote for you.

299
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:56,589
In fact, I was gonna put one
of your stickers in my taxi.

300
00:28:56,589 --> 00:29:00,288
But the company said it was against
their policy, they don't know anything.

301
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:02,888
- They're a bunch of jerks.
- Let me tell you something...

302
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:05,988
I have learned more about America
from riding in taxi cabs...

303
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,688
than in all the limos in the country.

304
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:11,888
- Yeah?
- That's true.

305
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:15,387
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

306
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:19,788
What is the one thing about this country
that bugs you the most?

307
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:24,687
Well, I don't know.
I don't follow political issues that closely.

308
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:27,987
There must be something.

309
00:29:30,488 --> 00:29:32,887
Whatever it is,
you should clean up this city here...

310
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:37,386
because this city is like an open sewer,
it's full of filth and scum.

311
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:42,986
Sometimes I can hardly take it.
Whoever becomes the President
should just...

312
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:45,786
really clean it up, know what I mean?

313
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:49,386
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

314
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:52,786
It's like, they just never go away, you know.

315
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:57,085
The President should just
clean up this whole mess here.

316
00:29:57,185 --> 00:30:00,385
He should flush it right down
the fucking toilet.

317
00:30:08,385 --> 00:30:10,985
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

318
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,284
But it's not gonna be easy.

319
00:30:13,384 --> 00:30:17,084
- We'll have to make some radical changes.
- Damn straight.

320
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,784
- Here you go, Travis. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

321
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:27,884
- Nice talking to you, Travis.
- Nice talking to you, sir.

322
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:32,183
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.
Thank you.

323
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:57,681
Come on, man. Get me out of here, all right?

324
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:01,981
Come on!

325
00:31:02,982 --> 00:31:07,281
Come on, baby. This is a real drag.
Don't make no scene.

326
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:12,882
You wanna get busted?
What's up, bitch, be cool!

327
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,080
Don't start no trouble.

328
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:28,180
Cabbie, forget about this. It's nothing.
Be cool, bitch.

329
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:24,077
Get your ass out of here.

330
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,772
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

331
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:40,872
- Did you have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.
Got a present for you.

332
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:48,372
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

333
00:33:56,971 --> 00:34:00,871
Why'd you do that?
What else am I gonna do with my money?

334
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:04,271
I wish you would've listened to this.

335
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:07,271
I would've, except my record player
doesn't work now.

336
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,671
Your stereo's broken? How can you
stand it? I couldn't live without music.

337
00:34:11,671 --> 00:34:15,471
I don't follow music too much.
But I would really like to. I really would.

338
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:18,671
- Then you haven't heard this record yet.
- No.

339
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:24,170
But I was thinking, maybe we could listen
to it on your record player.

340
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:28,370
Now going back to 40 years of Chick Webb.

341
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:47,669
- You've got to be kidding.
- Why?

342
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,669
This is a dirty movie.

343
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:53,068
No, this is a movie that...

344
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:56,568
a lot of couples come to,
all kinds of couples go here.

345
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:00,369
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I see them all the time.

346
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:05,867
Come on.

347
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:46,464
Excuse me!

348
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:48,165
Shut the fuck up.

349
00:35:48,465 --> 00:35:51,565
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.
Why?

350
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:55,364
I don't know why I came in here.
I don't like these movies.

351
00:35:55,564 --> 00:35:58,664
I didn't know you'd feel that way
about this movie.

352
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:01,864
- I don't know much about movies...
- This the only kind you go to?

353
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,865
Yeah, I come. This is not so bad.

354
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:09,364
Taking me to this place is about
as exciting as you saying, "Let's fuck."

355
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:16,664
There are other places,
plenty of other movies I can take you to.

356
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:21,362
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you to other places.
We're just different.

357
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,163
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

358
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:27,462
- I've got to go now.
- I wanna talk to you.

359
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:29,863
- I have to go.
- Wait a second.

360
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:30,962
Taxi!

361
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:35,362
Can't I talk to you at least?
Won't you talk to me? I didn't know...

362
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:38,462
- Look, won't you take the record?
- I've already got it.

363
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:41,362
But, please. I bought it for you, Betsy.

364
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:43,862
Thanks. Now I've got two. Let's go.

365
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:45,362
Can I call you?

366
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:48,962
Jesus Christ. I got a taxi.

367
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:57,360
Hello, Betsy. Hi, it's Travis.

368
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,660
How you doing?
Listen, I'm sorry about the other night.

369
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,660
I didn't know that's how you felt about it.

370
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:13,560
I didn't know that was the way you felt.
I would've taken you somewhere else.

371
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,860
Are you feeling better or...

372
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,960
Maybe you had a virus or something,
24-hour virus.

373
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,260
It can happen. Yeah.

374
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:31,958
You've been working hard.
I know it's... Yeah...

375
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:33,159
Okay.

376
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:38,158
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

377
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:41,258
in the next few days or something?

378
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:49,158
How about just a cup of coffee?
I could come by the headquarters.
We could...

379
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,658
Okay.

380
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:58,058
Did you get my flowers in the...

381
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:03,458
You didn't get them? I sent some flowers...

382
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:11,056
Yeah, okay.

383
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,556
Can I call you again tomorrow
or the next day?

384
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:18,556
Okay. No, I'm gonna... Yeah, sure, okay.

385
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:20,656
So long.

386
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:26,155
<i>I tried several times to call her,
but after the first call...</i>

387
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:29,455
<i>she wouldn't come to the phone any longer.</i>

388
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:31,756
<i>I also sent flowers, but with no luck.</i>

389
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:34,756
<i>The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.</i>

390
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:39,155
<i>The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.</i>

391
00:38:40,055 --> 00:38:42,655
<i>I shouldn't complain, though.</i>

392
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:45,055
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

393
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:48,455
<i>You're only as healthy as you feel.</i>

394
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:51,954
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

395
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:56,754
<i>as you feel.</i>

396
00:39:03,654 --> 00:39:05,453
Thank you very much.

397
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:09,754
Let's not have any trouble, okay?

398
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:13,254
What? Why won't you talk to me,
or answer my calls when I call?

399
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:16,253
- You think I don't know you're here?
- Let's not have trouble.

400
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,953
- Please leave.
- Get your hands off me.

401
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:19,954
- Okay, then leave.
- Know that I know.

402
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:24,052
Let's not have any trouble. Please.
This is no place to do this.

403
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,352
- Get your hands off me!
- Okay, just leave.

404
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:29,352
- Take them off!
- All right! Just leave now. Come on.

405
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:33,352
You're in a hell, and you're gonna die
in a hell like the rest of them!

406
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:38,052
- There's a cop across the street.
- You're like them.
I'm calling the cop. Officer!

407
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:47,951
Look. Don't come around here
because I'll call the police!

408
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,952
<i>I realize now how much
she's just like the others.</i>

409
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:55,351
<i>Cold and distant.
And many people are like that.</i>

410
00:39:55,752 --> 00:39:58,750
<i>Women for sure. They're like a union.</i>

411
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,250
Cab!

412
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:12,649
Pull over to the curb over there.

413
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:17,350
No, don't...

414
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,349
The fucking meter. What are you doing?
What are you doing with the meter?

415
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:25,249
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

416
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:28,449
Put the meter back, let the numbers go on.

417
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:33,249
I don't care what I have to pay.
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

418
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:35,148
Put it down.

419
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:38,548
That's right. Put it down.

420
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:47,747
Why are you writing?
Don't write! Put the thing down. Just sit.

421
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:54,147
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over to the curb."

422
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:57,647
We've pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

423
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,347
We're gonna sit.

424
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:22,346
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

425
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:27,846
The light, the window
up there on the second floor.

426
00:41:30,145 --> 00:41:33,445
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

427
00:41:34,545 --> 00:41:37,345
The light up in the window, second story.

428
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:41,445
What, are you blind?

429
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:43,345
Do you see the light?

430
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:46,545
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

431
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:51,443
See the woman in the window?

432
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,443
Do you see the woman in the window?

433
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:58,743
Yeah.

434
00:41:58,943 --> 00:42:00,943
You see the woman. Good.

435
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:04,443
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

436
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,643
But that's not my apartment.

437
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:14,343
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there?

438
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:19,143
You wouldn't know. I'm just saying...
But you know who lives there?

439
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:22,743
A nigger lives there. How do you like that?

440
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:32,342
I'm gonna kill her.

441
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:39,541
There's nothing else. I'm just gonna kill her.
What do you think of that?

442
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:44,241
I said, what do you think of that?

443
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,940
Don't answer.

444
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:48,841
You don't have to answer everything.

445
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,341
I'm gonna kill her with a.44 magnum pistol.

446
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,840
I have a.44 magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

447
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,340
Did you ever see what a.44 magnum
would do to a woman's face?

448
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,940
It'll fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

449
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,839
That's what it can do to her face.

450
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,039
Did you see what it can do
to a woman's pussy? That you should see.

451
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:19,439
You should see what a.44 magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

452
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:27,838
What's that?

453
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,039
I know you must think I'm...

454
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:33,838
You must think I'm pretty sick or something.

455
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:37,937
Right? You think I'm pretty sick?

456
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:44,937
Right? I bet you really think I'm sick.

457
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,837
You think I'm sick?

458
00:43:57,437 --> 00:44:00,937
You don't have to answer that.
I'm paying for the ride.

459
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:06,036
I picked up this midget.
He was very well dressed.

460
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:11,537
Italian suit. Good-looking.
Had a beautiful tall blonde.
A lady midget?

461
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:14,435
No, the guy was a midget.
The blonde was the lady.

462
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:17,235
- I got it.
- Those midgets are funny.

463
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:21,235
- Sometimes I like to hold a midget.
- Yeah?

464
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:24,935
They're funny. They always want
to sit in the front seat.

465
00:44:25,935 --> 00:44:29,435
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

466
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:35,134
They're wearing these rhinestone t-shirts.
They start arguing.

467
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:39,134
They start yelling.
The other says, "You bitch!"
And starts beating him on the head.

468
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:42,934
I say, "Look, I don't care what you do
in the privacy of your own home..."

469
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:44,235
"...behind closed doors."

470
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:48,234
"This is an American free country.
We've got a pursuit of happiness thing."

471
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:53,933
"You're consenting. You're adult.
But in my fucking cab..."

472
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:56,333
"...don't go busting heads."
You know what I mean?

473
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:59,533
"God loves you. Do what you want."
Tell them to go to California.

474
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:04,032
In California, when two fags split up,
one's got to pay the other alimony.

475
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:10,232
Not bad. They're way ahead out there.
You know what I mean? California.

476
00:45:10,632 --> 00:45:12,833
I tell them to get out of the fucking cab.

477
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:17,232
One time I saw a cop chasing this guy
with one leg. He was on crutches.

478
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,832
The cop?

479
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:22,533
No, the dude that he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

480
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:25,532
Hey, Travis. You got that five you owe me?

481
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:30,731
The man is loaded.

482
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,030
I'd be broke tonight if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio at Kennedy.

483
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,230
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach. Tipped me $5.

484
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:42,930
Where's the action around?

485
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,131
It's pretty slow.

486
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,431
I'm shoving on.

487
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:49,830
Wait.

488
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,730
Can I talk to you for a second?
Bye, killer.

489
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,830
Ninety-nine.

490
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:19,028
You can have all you want.
Don't be hitting on me!

491
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,929
You better take your ass out, boy!

492
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:31,928
- Yeah?
- I know you and I ain't talked too much.

493
00:46:32,428 --> 00:46:35,328
But I figured you've been around a lot.
So you could...

494
00:46:35,428 --> 00:46:38,428
Shoot, that's why they call me the "Wizard."

495
00:46:40,126 --> 00:46:42,127
It's just that I got a...

496
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:45,527
- I got a...
- Things got you down?

497
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:48,627
- Yeah.
- It happens to the best of us.

498
00:46:49,826 --> 00:46:51,927
Yeah, it got me real down.

499
00:46:58,126 --> 00:47:02,826
I just want to go out
and really do something.

500
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:07,826
Taxi life, you mean?

501
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:10,926
Yeah, well...

502
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:13,126
No, it's...

503
00:47:14,826 --> 00:47:16,225
I don't know.

504
00:47:18,324 --> 00:47:20,225
I just wanna go out...

505
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:22,624
and really...

506
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:25,824
I really wanna...

507
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:28,824
I got some bad ideas in my head. I just...

508
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,024
Look at it this way.

509
00:47:34,424 --> 00:47:37,424
A man takes a job, you know.

510
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:40,324
And that job...

511
00:47:40,723 --> 00:47:42,524
I mean, like that...

512
00:47:42,624 --> 00:47:44,623
That becomes what he is.

513
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:46,424
Like...

514
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:54,422
you do a thing and that's what you are.
Like, I've been a cabbie for 17 years.

515
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:59,123
Ten years at night.
I still don't own my own cab.
You know why?

516
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:03,522
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

517
00:48:04,622 --> 00:48:08,022
To be on the night shift
driving somebody else's cab.

518
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:09,522
You understand?

519
00:48:09,622 --> 00:48:13,122
I mean, you get a job, you become the job.

520
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:17,522
One guy lives in Brooklyn.
One guy lives in Sutton Place.

521
00:48:17,522 --> 00:48:20,322
You got a lawyer. Another guy's a doctor.

522
00:48:20,322 --> 00:48:23,121
Another guy dies. Another guy gets well.

523
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:25,322
People are born.

524
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:27,422
I envy you, your youth.

525
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:30,620
Go on, get laid.

526
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,520
Get drunk. Do anything.

527
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:38,920
Because you got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

528
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,220
More or less.

529
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,620
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

530
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,220
It's not Bertrand Russell.
What do you want? I'm a cabbie.
What do I know?

531
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:01,019
I don't even know
what the fuck you're talking about.
Maybe I don't know either.

532
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,819
Don't worry so much.

533
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,319
Relax, killer. You're gonna be all right.
I know. I've seen a lot of people, and...

534
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,218
- I know.
- Okay.

535
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,918
Thanks, man.

536
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:18,818
I guess...

537
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:23,617
Yeah, you're all right.

538
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:46,916
<i>What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the up and coming primary?</i>

539
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:49,216
<i>Mr. Goodwin is a fine man.</i>

540
00:49:49,316 --> 00:49:52,515
<i>I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...</i>

541
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:55,415
<i>to our opponent in the other party.</i>

542
00:49:55,515 --> 00:49:59,115
<i>I think that my programs
are better defined than his.</i>

543
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:03,115
<i>They're more imaginative,
and I have a better chance of winning.</i>

544
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:08,615
<i>I think it's academic, though, because
he's not gonna win the primary. I am.</i>

545
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,915
<i>One more thing I'd like to ask,
and that's about your campaign.</i>

546
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:14,216
<i>How do you feel your campaign's going?</i>

547
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:17,616
<i>When we came up with our slogan,
"We are the people"...</i>

548
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:20,714
<i>when I said, "Let the people rule"...</i>

549
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:23,214
<i>I felt I was being
somewhat overly optimistic.</i>

550
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:27,114
<i>I must tell you that I'm more optimistic
now than ever before.</i>

551
00:50:27,114 --> 00:50:30,813
<i>The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.</i>

552
00:50:31,213 --> 00:50:35,814
<i>The people are beginning to rule.
I feel it as the crowds swell.</i>

553
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:40,014
<i>I know it will continue through the primary,
it will continue in Miami...</i>

554
00:50:40,114 --> 00:50:45,013
<i>and I know it will rise
to an unprecedented swell in November.</i>

555
00:52:12,408 --> 00:52:16,008
Bitch, goddamn! I'll blow her face off!
I'll kill her, god damn it!

556
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:20,307
Damn! If I get my hands on her,
I'll kill her! Goddamn motherfucker!

557
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:23,007
I swear I'll kill that fucking bitch!

558
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:27,007
If I get my hands on her, I'll kill her!
Hey, Sport.

559
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:29,607
I'll kill her! Damn it!

560
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:32,907
- This guy keeps following.
- Don't look at him.

561
00:52:49,005 --> 00:52:50,405
Hey, guys.

562
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:55,805
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

563
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:11,304
<i>Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.</i>

564
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,105
<i>In bars, in cars.</i>

565
00:53:14,804 --> 00:53:17,504
<i>Sidewalks, stores, everywhere.</i>

566
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:20,505
<i>There's no escape.</i>

567
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:22,704
<i>I'm God's lonely man.</i>

568
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,403
<i>June 8.</i>

569
00:53:29,003 --> 00:53:31,303
<i>My life has taken another turn again.</i>

570
00:53:31,703 --> 00:53:34,803
<i>The days move along with regularity,
over and over.</i>

571
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:40,202
<i>One day indistinguishable from the next.
A long continuous chain.</i>

572
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:42,803
<i>Then suddenly...</i>

573
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:44,803
<i>there is change.</i>

574
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:04,301
Hey, Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.
How you doing, Travis?

575
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:32,300
- You got a.44 magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.
That's all right. I got money.

576
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,400
It's a real monster.

577
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,899
It will stop a car at 100 yards.
Put a round right through the engine block.

578
00:54:50,398 --> 00:54:51,799
Here you go.

579
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:54,899
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

580
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,698
Look at that.

581
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,698
That's a beauty.

582
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,698
I could sell this gun
to some jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

583
00:55:13,197 --> 00:55:16,497
But I deal high quality goods
to the right people.

584
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:19,197
How about that?

585
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:22,596
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

586
00:55:22,696 --> 00:55:25,397
In which case for you, I'd recommend...

587
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:27,497
.38 snub-nose.

588
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:30,497
Look at this.

589
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:37,296
Look at that. That's a beautiful little gun.
It's nickel-plated, snub-nose.

590
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:42,496
Otherwise the same as a service revolver.
That'll stop anything that moves.

591
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:46,496
A magnum, they use that in Africa
for killing elephants.

592
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:48,796
That.38, that's a fine gun.

593
00:55:54,794 --> 00:55:57,195
Some of these guns are like toys.

594
00:55:57,195 --> 00:55:58,494
That.38...

595
00:55:58,694 --> 00:56:00,695
you go and hammer nails with it all day...

596
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:04,294
come back and it'll cut dead center
on target every time.

597
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:07,994
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

598
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:12,994
You interested in an automatic?

599
00:56:13,295 --> 00:56:16,494
It's a colt.25 automatic. It's a nice little gun.

600
00:56:17,094 --> 00:56:21,194
It's a beautiful little gun. Holds six shots
in the clip, one shot in the chamber.

601
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,194
That's if you're dumb enough
to put a round in the chamber.

602
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:28,393
Here, look at this. A.380 Walther.

603
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:31,493
Holds eight shots in the clip.

604
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:34,292
That's a nice gun.

605
00:56:34,693 --> 00:56:37,692
That's a beautiful little gun. Look at that.

606
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:44,492
During World War II,
they used this gun to replace the P-38.

607
00:56:45,793 --> 00:56:47,892
Just given out to officers.

608
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:55,892
Isn't that a little honey?

609
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:07,691
- How much for everything?
- All together.

610
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,390
Only a jackass would carry that cannon
in the streets like that. Here.

611
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:16,490
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

612
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:17,791
$40.

613
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,290
$350 for the magnum, $250 for the.38...

614
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:26,190
$125 for the.25, $150 for the.380.

615
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:29,890
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

616
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,390
How about dope? Grass, hash, coke...

617
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,090
mescaline, downers, Nembutal,
toluol, chloral hydrates?

618
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:41,288
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- I'm not interested in that stuff.

619
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:44,288
I can get you crystal meth, nitrous oxide.

620
00:57:44,388 --> 00:57:48,488
I can get you a brand-new Cadillac
with a pink slip for $2,000.

621
00:57:57,388 --> 00:57:58,888
<i>June 29.</i>

622
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:02,987
<i>I got to get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.</i>

623
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:05,488
<i>Too much abuse has gone on for too long.</i>

624
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:10,287
<i>From now on it'll be 50 pushups
each morning, 50 pull-ups.</i>

625
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:15,786
<i>There will be no more pills, no more
bad food, no more destroyers of my body.</i>

626
00:58:16,586 --> 00:58:21,487
<i>From now on it'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be tight.</i>

627
00:58:37,686 --> 00:58:41,485
<i>Look at the size of that. Oh, yeah.</i>

628
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,685
<i>It looks so good.</i>

629
00:58:50,086 --> 00:58:54,084
<i>It's getting harder and harder.
It's throbbing now.</i>

630
00:58:55,984 --> 00:59:00,084
<i>The idea had been growing in my brain
for some time.</i>

631
00:59:00,984 --> 00:59:06,484
<i>True force. All the king's men
cannot put it back together again.</i>

632
01:01:08,077 --> 01:01:12,077
Where do get more of these?
Where do you think?
Back at the headquarters.

633
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:15,877
Go all the way back there to get to town.
- Come on.
- All right. It'll work.

634
01:01:15,977 --> 01:01:18,775
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- It's not. I've done this 100 times.

635
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:21,076
- You've done this before?
- Yes. Don't worry.

636
01:01:21,176 --> 01:01:25,275
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.
Betsy?

637
01:01:27,576 --> 01:01:28,575
What?

638
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:31,175
Betsy. Come here.

639
01:02:30,273 --> 01:02:33,071
You're a Secret Service man, aren't you?

640
01:02:34,972 --> 01:02:37,172
Just waiting for the Senator.

641
01:02:37,872 --> 01:02:40,171
You're waiting for the Senator?

642
01:02:43,871 --> 01:02:45,971
That's a very good answer.

643
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,772
Shit, man.

644
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:52,671
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.

645
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:57,471
No. The reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man...

646
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:00,071
I won't say anything, because I...

647
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:07,370
I saw some suspicious looking people
over there.

648
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:10,270
- You did?
- They were right over there.

649
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:17,269
They were just here. I...

650
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:22,769
They were very, very...

651
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:24,869
- Suspicious?
- Yeah.

652
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:29,469
Where'd they go?

653
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:34,769
Is it hard to get to be in the Secret Service?
Why?

654
01:03:34,969 --> 01:03:39,269
I was just curious,
'cause I think I'd be good at it.
I'm very observant.

655
01:03:40,168 --> 01:03:42,269
I was in the Marine Corps.

656
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:45,068
I'm good with crowds.

657
01:03:47,467 --> 01:03:51,667
I notice there's a little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

658
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,467
- Sort of.
- Signal.

659
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:56,267
A secret signal for the Secret Service.

660
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:05,666
What kind of guns you guys carry?
.38s?.45s?.357 magnums?

661
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:07,567
Something bigger maybe?

662
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:12,166
Look, if you're really interested,
if you give me your name and address...

663
01:04:12,566 --> 01:04:16,466
we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

664
01:04:18,566 --> 01:04:20,967
- You will?
- Sure.
Okay.

665
01:04:21,865 --> 01:04:23,065
Why not?

666
01:04:26,865 --> 01:04:28,565
My name is Henry...

667
01:04:30,265 --> 01:04:32,265
Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

668
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:38,965
154 Hopper Avenue.

669
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:42,265
- Hopper.
- Yeah.

670
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,964
Like a rabbit. Hip, hop.

671
01:04:50,664 --> 01:04:52,465
Fairlawn, New Jersey.

672
01:04:55,564 --> 01:04:59,063
- Is there a zip code with that, Henry?
- Yeah. 610452.

673
01:05:02,163 --> 01:05:04,363
- Okay.
- That's six digits.

674
01:05:06,863 --> 01:05:08,663
61045.

675
01:05:10,463 --> 01:05:11,463
Okay.

676
01:05:12,462 --> 01:05:15,163
I was thinking of my telephone number.

677
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:19,762
I've got it all, Henry,
we'll get all the stuff right out to you.

678
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:23,162
Thanks a lot. Great. Hell. Jesus.

679
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:25,762
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

680
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:29,762
You have to be careful
living around a place like this.
Bye.

681
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:38,961
Damn it.

682
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,159
Faster than you, you fucking son of a...

683
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,659
I saw you coming, you fucking shit-heel.

684
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:21,659
I'm standing here. You make the move.

685
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:25,559
It's your move.

686
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:30,858
Don't try it, you fuck.

687
01:06:37,558 --> 01:06:39,258
You talking to me?

688
01:06:49,557 --> 01:06:53,357
Then who the hell else are you talking to?
You talking to me?

689
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:55,456
I'm the only one here.

690
01:06:57,357 --> 01:07:00,357
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

691
01:07:01,057 --> 01:07:02,256
Oh, yeah?

692
01:07:04,856 --> 01:07:05,856
Okay.

693
01:07:13,556 --> 01:07:16,056
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

694
01:07:16,256 --> 01:07:20,855
<i>Here is a man
who would not take it anymore.
Who would not let...</i>

695
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:24,554
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

696
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:28,154
<i>Here is a man
who would not take it anymore.</i>

697
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:33,055
<i>A man who stood up against the scum,
the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.</i>

698
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:35,654
<i>Here is someone who stood up.</i>

699
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:38,654
<i>Here is...</i>

700
01:07:43,354 --> 01:07:44,754
You're dead.

701
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:27,452
Yeah, man?

702
01:08:27,452 --> 01:08:31,251
Shut your mouth. Give me the cash
out of the drawer. Come on.

703
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:33,452
Let's go. Give me the goddamn cash.

704
01:08:33,552 --> 01:08:36,852
- Don't shoot. I'm getting it.
- Stop taking so long. Come on.

705
01:08:37,252 --> 01:08:39,751
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

706
01:08:39,851 --> 01:08:41,850
- This all you got? Get the rest.
- That's it.

707
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,450
- I don't have any more.
- Give me the rest of the cash.

708
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,150
- That's all I got.
- Give me more.

709
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,950
- I got no money.
- Reach in your sock. You got more bread.

710
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:52,750
- That's it, man.
- Give me the rest of the fucking bread.

711
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,650
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

712
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:05,750
Shit, man.

713
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:11,750
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

714
01:09:17,248 --> 01:09:21,848
Listen, I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

715
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:27,248
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

716
01:09:27,348 --> 01:09:29,848
- Can I give you some money?
- No. Just get out of here.

717
01:09:29,848 --> 01:09:32,647
No, man. I'll take care of it. Go ahead.

718
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:40,948
That's the fifth motherfucker this year.
You wanna buy that little dope?

719
01:11:24,941 --> 01:11:28,141
<i>Walt Whitman, that great American poet...</i>

720
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:34,441
<i>spoke for all of us when he said:
"I am the man. I suffered. I was there."</i>

721
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:38,141
<i>Today I say to you, we are the people.</i>

722
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:41,540
<i>We suffered. We were there.</i>

723
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:47,639
<i>We, the people, suffered in Vietnam.</i>

724
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,239
<i>We, the people, suffered,
we still suffer from unemployment...</i>

725
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:56,639
<i>inflation, crime and corruption.</i>

726
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:02,239
<i>"Dear Father and Mother."</i>

727
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,239
<i>"July is the month I remember
which brings..."</i>

728
01:12:05,339 --> 01:12:07,839
<i>"...not only your wedding anniversary...</i>

729
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:11,239
<i>"...but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday."</i>

730
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:14,539
<i>"I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates..."</i>

731
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:18,438
<i>"...but I hope this card
will take care of them all."</i>

732
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:22,137
<i>"I'm sorry again
I cannot send you my address..."</i>

733
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,838
<i>"...like I promised to last year."</i>

734
01:12:24,838 --> 01:12:27,638
<i>"But the sensitive nature of my work
for the government..."</i>

735
01:12:27,738 --> 01:12:30,037
<i>"...demands utmost secrecy."</i>

736
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:34,137
<i>"I know you will understand."</i>

737
01:12:34,237 --> 01:12:37,137
<i>"I am healthy and well,
and making lots of money."</i>

738
01:12:37,137 --> 01:12:39,537
<i>"I have been going with a girl
for several months..."</i>

739
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:42,637
<i>"...and I know you would be proud
if you could see her."</i>

740
01:12:42,637 --> 01:12:46,337
<i>"Here name is Betsy,
but I can tell you no more than that."</i>

741
01:12:46,837 --> 01:12:49,237
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

742
01:12:50,637 --> 01:12:53,337
Come on, let's go. Move it.

743
01:12:53,637 --> 01:12:59,135
<i>No more will we, the people...
bear the burden of suffering for the few.</i>

744
01:13:00,036 --> 01:13:03,536
<i>No more will we fight the wars of the few...</i>

745
01:13:03,636 --> 01:13:05,935
<i>to the harm of the many.</i>

746
01:13:09,435 --> 01:13:13,434
<i>"I hope this card finds you all well
as it does me."</i>

747
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:16,834
<i>"I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me."</i>

748
01:13:17,235 --> 01:13:20,935
<i>"One day there'll be a knock on the door,
and it'll be me."</i>

749
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:23,334
<i>"Love, Travis."</i>

750
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,234
<i>- Don't you have some idea?
- I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

751
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:34,133
<i>- Don't you have some idea?
- I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

752
01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:37,833
<i>But you must know that the reason
I didn't marry him...</i>

753
01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:42,533
<i>is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.</i>

754
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:49,333
<i>Now, he's getting a divorce anyway, and...</i>

755
01:13:52,132 --> 01:13:54,933
<i>Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.</i>

756
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,632
<i>I do love him.</i>

757
01:14:04,033 --> 01:14:06,132
<i>What about us, June?</i>

758
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:09,131
<i>Our marriage?</i>

759
01:14:11,731 --> 01:14:14,132
<i>You've got to know
that our marriage wasn't legal.</i>

760
01:14:14,132 --> 01:14:17,031
<i>In the eyes of God, we are married.</i>

761
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:23,631
<i>Brock, please don't do this to me.</i>

762
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:28,030
<i>I love him...</i>

763
01:14:36,331 --> 01:14:37,430
Damn!

764
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:40,630
Goddamn!

765
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:18,528
Are you trying to get rid of me?

766
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:24,926
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

767
01:15:28,126 --> 01:15:30,827
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

768
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:33,927
All right. You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

769
01:15:34,027 --> 01:15:37,027
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

770
01:15:41,226 --> 01:15:44,426
Is your name Matthew? I want some action.

771
01:15:45,026 --> 01:15:46,427
Officer...

772
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:51,326
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

773
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:54,126
You gonna bust me for nothing, man?

774
01:15:54,226 --> 01:15:55,826
I'm not a cop.

775
01:15:56,626 --> 01:15:59,725
- I ain't no cop.
- Then why ask me for action?

776
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,624
Because she sent me over.

777
01:16:06,025 --> 01:16:11,024
I suppose that ain't a.38
you got in your sock.
.38? No.

778
01:16:12,225 --> 01:16:13,824
I'm clean, man.

779
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,724
- Shit. You're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

780
01:16:18,124 --> 01:16:19,524
That's nice.

781
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:25,224
It's all right.
$15, 15 minutes. $25, half an hour.

782
01:16:27,024 --> 01:16:28,124
Shit.

783
01:16:29,023 --> 01:16:30,424
Cowboy, huh?

784
01:16:32,024 --> 01:16:36,022
I once had a horse in Coney Island.
She got hit by a car.

785
01:16:38,822 --> 01:16:40,623
Take it or leave it.

786
01:16:40,823 --> 01:16:44,123
If you wanna save yourself some money,
don't fuck her.

787
01:16:44,223 --> 01:16:46,122
'Cause you'll be back every night
for more.

788
01:16:46,122 --> 01:16:50,623
She's twelve-and-a-half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

789
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:52,322
You can do anything with her...

790
01:16:52,422 --> 01:16:56,122
come on her, fuck her in the mouth,
fuck her in the ass, come on her face.

791
01:16:56,222 --> 01:16:59,622
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

792
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:04,122
But no rough stuff. All right?

793
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:11,721
All right, I'll take it.

794
01:17:11,921 --> 01:17:14,620
Hey, man! Take out no money over here.

795
01:17:15,621 --> 01:17:20,021
You gonna fuck me?
You're gonna fuck her.
You give her the money.

796
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,520
Catch you later, copper.

797
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,420
- What did you say?
- See you later, copper.

798
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,620
I'm no cop, man.

799
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,420
If you are, it's entrapment already.

800
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,519
I'm hip.

801
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,520
Buddy, you don't look hip.

802
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:48,919
Go ahead, have yourself a good time.

803
01:17:57,818 --> 01:17:59,618
You're a funny guy.

804
01:18:02,818 --> 01:18:05,018
But looks aren't everything.

805
01:18:05,318 --> 01:18:07,418
Go ahead, have a good time.

806
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:14,318
You're a funny guy.

807
01:18:56,615 --> 01:18:58,716
The room will cost you $10.

808
01:19:11,714 --> 01:19:13,514
I'm timing you, too.

809
01:19:32,613 --> 01:19:33,813
Come on.

810
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:46,112
Are you really twelve-and-a-half?

811
01:19:47,712 --> 01:19:51,411
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

812
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:57,112
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

813
01:20:01,211 --> 01:20:02,812
How old are you?

814
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:06,812
You don't want to tell me?

815
01:20:06,812 --> 01:20:09,612
- What's your name?
- Easy.

816
01:20:10,211 --> 01:20:15,410
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.
But what's your real name?

817
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:19,510
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?

818
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:24,710
Iris.

819
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:30,009
What's wrong with that? That's a nice name.
That's what you think.

820
01:20:36,909 --> 01:20:40,409
No, don't do that. Don't you remember me?

821
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:44,709
Remember when you got into a taxi?
It was a checker taxi.

822
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:49,409
You got in and that guy Matthew came by
and he said he wanted to take you away.

823
01:20:49,608 --> 01:20:51,408
He pulled you away.

824
01:20:52,808 --> 01:20:54,908
No, I don't remember that.

825
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:58,407
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

826
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:01,907
That's all right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

827
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:05,407
We better make it or Sport will get mad.
How do you wanna make it?

828
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:09,907
I don't want to make it. Who's Sport?
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

829
01:21:15,207 --> 01:21:17,308
Want to make it like this?

830
01:21:23,307 --> 01:21:26,606
Listen, I...
Can't you understand something?

831
01:21:26,706 --> 01:21:30,306
You're the one who came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

832
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:32,306
I must have been stoned.

833
01:21:32,406 --> 01:21:35,806
What do you mean? They drug you?
Come off it, man.

834
01:21:37,305 --> 01:21:39,106
What are you doing?

835
01:21:39,406 --> 01:21:41,405
Don't you wanna make it?

836
01:21:44,705 --> 01:21:47,705
No, I don't wanna make it. I wanna help you.

837
01:21:47,805 --> 01:21:49,605
Well, I can help you.

838
01:21:54,005 --> 01:21:57,405
Damn, man! Goddamn it!

839
01:22:01,805 --> 01:22:04,904
Shit, man!
What the hell's the matter with you?

840
01:22:06,103 --> 01:22:10,604
You don't have to make it, mister.
Goddamn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

841
01:22:12,503 --> 01:22:15,104
Can't you understand why I came here?

842
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:17,804
I think I understand.

843
01:22:19,703 --> 01:22:24,003
I tried to get into your cab one night,
and now you wanna take me away.

844
01:22:25,403 --> 01:22:26,703
Is that it?

845
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:29,003
Yeah, but don't you want to go?

846
01:22:29,203 --> 01:22:33,203
I can leave anytime I want to.
Then what about that one night?

847
01:22:35,102 --> 01:22:36,903
Look, I was stoned.

848
01:22:39,502 --> 01:22:41,701
That's why they stopped me.

849
01:22:43,602 --> 01:22:46,702
When I'm not stoned,
I got no place else to go.

850
01:22:47,901 --> 01:22:52,201
So they just protect me from myself.

851
01:22:58,301 --> 01:23:00,701
No. I don't know.

852
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:06,101
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

853
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,201
Look, I understand.

854
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:12,001
And it means something, really.

855
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:19,699
Look, can I see you again?
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

856
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:23,799
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

857
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:29,199
All right. How about breakfast tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, when?
- I get up at about 1:00.

858
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:35,598
Well, I got a thing...

859
01:23:35,598 --> 01:23:40,299
Come on, do you want to or not?
Yeah, I want... Okay, all right. 1:00.

860
01:23:42,298 --> 01:23:43,899
See you tomorrow.

861
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:48,099
Iris, my name is Travis.

862
01:23:49,098 --> 01:23:50,899
Thanks a lot, Travis.

863
01:23:52,997 --> 01:23:55,697
So long, Iris. See you tomorrow.

864
01:23:57,598 --> 01:23:58,997
Sweet Iris.

865
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,096
This is yours.

866
01:24:25,597 --> 01:24:27,196
Spend it right.

867
01:24:32,696 --> 01:24:36,095
- Come back anytime, cowboy.
- I will.

868
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:58,095
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

869
01:24:58,395 --> 01:25:02,194
I mean, they hate me.
Why do you think I split in the first place?

870
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:06,893
There ain't nothing there.
Yeah, but you can't live like this. It's a hell.

871
01:25:07,293 --> 01:25:09,393
A girl should live at home.

872
01:25:10,093 --> 01:25:13,993
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
What do you mean, women's lib?

873
01:25:14,093 --> 01:25:17,093
You're a young girl.
You should be home now.

874
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:21,192
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys, going to school.

875
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:24,792
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- God, are you square.

876
01:25:24,992 --> 01:25:29,292
Hey, I'm not square.
You're the one that's square.
You're full of shit, man.

877
01:25:29,392 --> 01:25:32,692
What are you talking about?
You walk out with those fucking creeps...

878
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:37,992
lowlifes and degenerates out on the street
and you sell your little pussy for nothing...

879
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:41,692
for some lowlife pimp
who stands in a hole?

880
01:25:43,691 --> 01:25:46,791
I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

881
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:50,891
I don't screw and fuck with a bunch
of killers and junkies the way you do.

882
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:53,191
You call that being hip?

883
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,791
What world you from?

884
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:04,390
- Who's a killer?
- Sport's a killer, that's who's a killer.

885
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,590
- Sport never killed nobody.
- He killed somebody.

886
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,691
- He's a Libra.
- He's a what?

887
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:12,090
I'm a Libra, too.
That's why we get along so well.

888
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,790
He looks like a killer to me.

889
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:20,689
I think that Cancers make the best lovers...

890
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:25,488
but, God, my whole family are earth signs.
He's also a dope shooter.

891
01:26:25,988 --> 01:26:29,588
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

892
01:26:29,588 --> 01:26:33,489
Didn't you ever try looking
at your own eyeballs in the mirror?

893
01:26:38,488 --> 01:26:41,189
So what are you gonna do
about Sport and that old bastard?

894
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:43,188
- When?
- When you leave.

895
01:26:46,688 --> 01:26:49,388
- I don't know. Just leave them.
- You're just gonna leave?

896
01:26:49,488 --> 01:26:54,287
- They've got plenty of other girls.
- You just can't do that. What will you do?

897
01:26:56,287 --> 01:27:00,387
- What do you want me to do, call the cops?
- Cops don't do nothing. You know that.

898
01:27:00,886 --> 01:27:04,786
Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up
or anything like that once.

899
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:08,286
But you can't allow him
to do the same to other girls.

900
01:27:08,386 --> 01:27:12,787
You can't allow him to do that.
He's the lowest kind of person in the world.

901
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:16,487
Somebody's got to do something to him.
He's the scum of the earth.

902
01:27:16,587 --> 01:27:20,286
He's the worst sucking scum...

903
01:27:20,286 --> 01:27:22,186
I have ever seen.

904
01:27:24,486 --> 01:27:26,986
You know what he told me about you?

905
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:33,284
He's calling you names.
He called you a little piece of chicken.

906
01:27:34,685 --> 01:27:36,884
He doesn't mean that.

907
01:27:39,584 --> 01:27:42,784
I'll move up to one
of them communes in Vermont.

908
01:27:47,584 --> 01:27:52,084
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know, you know?
I saw...

909
01:27:53,384 --> 01:27:56,884
some pictures once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

910
01:27:56,884 --> 01:28:02,183
Why don't you come
to the commune with me?
What, come to the commune with you? No.

911
01:28:02,984 --> 01:28:04,184
Why not?

912
01:28:06,184 --> 01:28:08,483
I don't go to places like that.

913
01:28:09,382 --> 01:28:12,782
- Come on, why not?
- I don't get along with people like that.

914
01:28:12,882 --> 01:28:14,982
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

915
01:28:14,982 --> 01:28:18,382
That's it, you're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

916
01:28:19,182 --> 01:28:21,382
Besides, I got to stay here.

917
01:28:21,782 --> 01:28:26,582
- Come on, why?
- I got something very important to do.
What's so important?

918
01:28:28,082 --> 01:28:30,581
Doing something for the government.

919
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:33,581
The cab thing is just part-time.

920
01:28:34,582 --> 01:28:36,082
Are you a narc?

921
01:28:38,782 --> 01:28:41,482
- Do I look like a narc?
- Yeah.

922
01:28:43,082 --> 01:28:44,481
I am a narc.

923
01:28:45,881 --> 01:28:48,981
God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me.

924
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,980
Sure you don't wanna come with me?

925
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,280
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you the money to go.

926
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:03,080
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, I want you to take it.

927
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:06,179
I don't want you to take anything from them.

928
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:07,880
And I wanna do it.

929
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:11,380
I don't have anything better to do
with my money.

930
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:15,080
I might be going away for a while.

931
01:29:40,678 --> 01:29:43,378
You're just a little tense, that's all.

932
01:29:44,177 --> 01:29:46,678
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

933
01:29:46,978 --> 01:29:50,078
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

934
01:29:50,078 --> 01:29:54,077
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

935
01:29:55,777 --> 01:30:01,076
You never spend any time with me anymore.
I've got to attend to business, baby.

936
01:30:02,576 --> 01:30:04,776
You miss your man, don't you?

937
01:30:06,376 --> 01:30:09,276
I don't like to be away from you, either.

938
01:30:10,075 --> 01:30:12,376
You know how I feel about you.

939
01:30:13,675 --> 01:30:15,276
I depend on you.

940
01:30:17,976 --> 01:30:19,975
I'd be lost without you.

941
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,975
Don't you ever forget that.

942
01:30:32,575 --> 01:30:34,375
How much I need you.

943
01:30:37,074 --> 01:30:38,673
Come to me, baby.

944
01:30:48,973 --> 01:30:50,574
Let me hold you.

945
01:30:57,474 --> 01:31:01,073
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

946
01:31:06,173 --> 01:31:10,273
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

947
01:31:15,772 --> 01:31:18,072
That every woman everywhere...

948
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:23,172
had a man that loves her like I love you.

949
01:31:27,371 --> 01:31:30,171
God, it's good so close.

950
01:31:42,671 --> 01:31:47,271
You know, at times like this,
I know I'm a lucky man.

951
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:53,670
Touching a woman
who wants me and needs me.

952
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:02,769
Yeah, it's only you that keeps me together.

953
01:33:35,664 --> 01:33:39,563
<i>Now I see it clearly.
My whole life is pointed in one direction.</i>

954
01:33:39,963 --> 01:33:41,863
<i>I see that now.</i>

955
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:45,663
<i>There never has been any choice for me.</i>

956
01:34:20,861 --> 01:34:24,261
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the next president of the United States...</i>

957
01:34:24,361 --> 01:34:26,761
<i>Senator Charles Palantine.</i>

958
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:34,361
<i>Thank you, Tom.</i>

959
01:34:35,261 --> 01:34:36,860
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

960
01:34:37,061 --> 01:34:41,161
<i>we are met today at a crossroads:
Columbus Circle.</i>

961
01:34:41,861 --> 01:34:44,261
<i>This is no ordinary place.</i>

962
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:47,060
<i>It is a place where many roads...</i>

963
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,660
<i>and many lives intersect.</i>

964
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:53,059
<i>It is appropriate that we meet here today...</i>

965
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:56,159
<i>because these are not ordinary times.</i>

966
01:34:56,659 --> 01:35:00,159
<i>We meet at a crossroads in history.</i>

967
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:05,158
<i>For far too long,
the wrong roads have been taken.</i>

968
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:08,258
<i>The wrong roads have led us into war...</i>

969
01:35:08,258 --> 01:35:12,358
<i>into poverty, into unemployment
and inflation.</i>

970
01:35:13,459 --> 01:35:17,658
<i>Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.</i>

971
01:35:20,858 --> 01:35:25,058
<i>No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.</i>

972
01:35:33,357 --> 01:35:38,157
<i>Now, I would lie to you if I told you
the new roads would be easy.</i>

973
01:35:38,357 --> 01:35:40,556
<i>They will not be easy.</i>

974
01:35:40,656 --> 01:35:44,356
<i>Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.</i>

975
01:35:44,456 --> 01:35:46,856
<i>We, the people, know that.</i>

976
01:35:50,356 --> 01:35:54,656
<i>And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.</i>

977
01:35:55,757 --> 01:35:59,956
<i>Today I say to you,
we are the people, you and I...</i>

978
01:36:00,056 --> 01:36:03,256
<i>and it is time to let the people rule.</i>

979
01:36:03,356 --> 01:36:04,955
<i>Thank you.</i>

980
01:36:20,955 --> 01:36:23,354
All right, let him go, pull back.

981
01:36:28,254 --> 01:36:29,554
Palantine!

982
01:36:38,154 --> 01:36:39,454
Thank you.

983
01:36:44,652 --> 01:36:46,653
Over there. Get that man.

984
01:36:48,352 --> 01:36:50,053
Give him some air!

985
01:36:50,453 --> 01:36:52,653
Give him some air, will you?

986
01:36:52,953 --> 01:36:55,452
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

987
01:36:55,652 --> 01:36:57,152
Where was he?

988
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:26,450
- What's happening?
- How you doing?
Got the money?

989
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,650
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

990
01:38:16,048 --> 01:38:18,148
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

991
01:38:18,248 --> 01:38:20,347
Okay, my man. How are you?

992
01:38:21,848 --> 01:38:24,748
- Where do I know you from?
- I don't know.

993
01:38:25,048 --> 01:38:27,747
How's everything in the pimp business?

994
01:38:28,348 --> 01:38:31,646
- Do I know you?
- No. Do I know you?

995
01:38:32,647 --> 01:38:36,147
- Get out of here. Come on, get lost.
- Do I know you?

996
01:38:38,446 --> 01:38:39,746
How's Iris?

997
01:38:40,046 --> 01:38:41,546
You know, Iris.

998
01:38:41,746 --> 01:38:44,046
I don't know nobody named Iris.

999
01:38:44,646 --> 01:38:47,246
Iris. Come on, get out of here, man.

1000
01:38:47,246 --> 01:38:51,846
You don't know anybody
by the name of Iris?
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1001
01:38:52,545 --> 01:38:53,546
No?

1002
01:38:53,646 --> 01:38:56,245
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1003
01:38:56,245 --> 01:38:59,245
Do me a favor.
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1004
01:39:00,746 --> 01:39:02,245
You got a gun?

1005
01:39:03,746 --> 01:39:06,845
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1006
01:39:07,045 --> 01:39:08,544
Suck on this.

1007
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,040
You crazy son of a bitch!

1008
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:28,839
Fucking son of a bitch, you! I'll kill you!

1009
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:35,139
I'll fucking kill you!

1010
01:40:35,139 --> 01:40:37,740
Crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1011
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:59,138
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1012
01:40:59,838 --> 01:41:03,238
You crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1013
01:41:10,237 --> 01:41:11,337
Stop!

1014
01:41:24,137 --> 01:41:26,038
No! Don't shoot him!

1015
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:10,721
<i>"Dear Mr. Bickle...
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were..."</i>

1016
01:46:10,821 --> 01:46:14,121
<i>"...to hear that you are well and recuperating."</i>

1017
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:17,220
<i>"We tried to visit you at the hospital..."</i>

1018
01:46:17,521 --> 01:46:22,720
<i>"...when we were in New York to pick up Iris.
But you were still in a coma."</i>

1019
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:28,219
<i>"There is no way we can repay you
for returning our Iris to us."</i>

1020
01:46:28,919 --> 01:46:33,719
<i>"We thought we had lost her,
and now our lives are full again."</i>

1021
01:46:34,418 --> 01:46:36,019
<i>"Needless to say..."</i>

1022
01:46:36,019 --> 01:46:40,019
<i>"...you are something of a hero
around this household."</i>

1023
01:46:41,318 --> 01:46:44,818
<i>"I'm sure you want to know about Iris."</i>

1024
01:46:45,018 --> 01:46:48,418
<i>"She's back in school and working hard."</i>

1025
01:46:49,018 --> 01:46:53,918
<i>"The transition has been very hard for her,
as you can well imagine."</i>

1026
01:46:54,418 --> 01:47:00,118
<i>"But we have taken steps to see...
she has never cause to run away again."</i>

1027
01:47:01,518 --> 01:47:05,117
<i>"In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I..."</i>

1028
01:47:05,217 --> 01:47:09,716
<i>"...would like to again thank you
from the bottom of our hearts."</i>

1029
01:47:10,016 --> 01:47:14,016
<i>"Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again..."</i>

1030
01:47:14,216 --> 01:47:17,716
<i>"...to thank you in person, or we surely would."</i>

1031
01:47:18,417 --> 01:47:21,417
<i>"But if you should ever come
to Pittsburgh..."</i>

1032
01:47:21,517 --> 01:47:25,916
<i>"...you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home."</i>

1033
01:47:26,316 --> 01:47:28,416
<i>"Our deepest thanks."</i>

1034
01:47:28,616 --> 01:47:30,916
<i>"Burt and Ivy Steensma."</i>

1035
01:47:32,816 --> 01:47:35,515
This guy Eddie, the owner-operator,
comes up and says:

1036
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:39,115
"I want to swap tires."
I said, "These are new tires."

1037
01:47:39,115 --> 01:47:44,215
"Why don't you throw in something else,
like your wife?"
His wife was Miss New Jersey 1957.

1038
01:47:44,215 --> 01:47:48,514
That's why the fleet has no spares.
Doughboy, wizard, killer.

1039
01:47:49,014 --> 01:47:51,414
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1040
01:47:52,014 --> 01:47:53,915
Travis, you got a fare.

1041
01:47:55,514 --> 01:47:56,514
Shit.

1042
01:47:58,014 --> 01:48:00,515
- See you later.
- See you, Travis.

1043
01:48:21,913 --> 01:48:23,412
Hello, Travis.

1044
01:48:25,112 --> 01:48:26,312
Hello.

1045
01:48:47,212 --> 01:48:49,811
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1046
01:48:51,212 --> 01:48:54,311
Yeah. Won't be long now. Seventeen days.

1047
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:57,110
I hope he wins.

1048
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:14,409
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1049
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:19,710
It was nothing, really. I got over that.

1050
01:49:22,209 --> 01:49:24,709
Papers always blow these things up.

1051
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:29,309
Just a little stiffness, that's all.

1052
01:50:13,706 --> 01:50:15,306
How much was it?

1053
01:50:24,506 --> 01:50:25,705
So long.
