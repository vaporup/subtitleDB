1
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:28,639
It's on.

2
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:33,840
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

3
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,813
What is that?
You look like a panda with that eye.

4
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:41,683
Well, you have a retro-style TV as a head.

5
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,118
Wha... What the hell are we doing here?

6
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:49,424
I don't know.
I don't remember anything at all.

7
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,090
Aren't you cold?
I want some clothes.

8
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,463
Really?

9
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:55,798
I'm hungry too.

10
00:00:58,339 --> 00:00:58,930
I...

11
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:38,404
Criminals have appeared.
Criminals have appeared.

12
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,575
The police will arrive in one minute.
Do not interfere with the suspects.

13
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,641
- We need a car.
- Leave it to me.

14
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,912
Hey!

15
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,306
This is the police!
Slow that vehicle down!

16
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:13,372
Ah! They're here, Pandy! Speed up!
I'll cause a distraction!

17
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,476
We're so powerful!

18
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,654
We must surely have been assassins
before our memories were erased!

19
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,519
- Retro, look.
- What, Pandy?

20
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:07,487
That's the moon, I think.
It's got a huge bite taken out of it.

21
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,926
It's good to be violent to people.

22
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:26,735
In order to protect the public peace,

23
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:30,614
we charge you with trespassing,
theft, violence, assault,

24
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:34,415
possession of illegal firearms
and much more.

25
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:38,424
Therefore you will be imprisoned in DL,
the prison on the surface of the moon.

26
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:41,518
Imprisoned in DL,
the prison on the surface of the moon.

27
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:55,705
Hey! What are you doing?

28
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,343
There once was a field with one tall tree.

29
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:35,542
There were many leaves on that tree.

30
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:39,518
A lot of caterpillars
made their meals there.

31
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:44,982
In the morning, to the sun...
In the evening, to the moon...

32
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:48,152
The tree was so tall,
it seemed to reach those heights.

33
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,461
"I always looked at that,"
the working ants said to the caterpillars.

34
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,694
"Hey, you!"

35
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,439
"If you're always looking up,
won't your necks get tired?"

36
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:06,138
"That's why your bodies are so stretched out,
because you're always looking up."

37
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:10,606
Whoa! What is this?
I can't move!

38
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:15,317
I can't move! Aah!
Let me out, assholes!

39
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,822
Does it really matter?

40
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,255
It sucks!

41
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,958
Let me go!

42
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,590
Are you listening?

43
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,464
Hey, let me out!

44
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:38,667
It's time to eat!

45
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,349
Wow. There are so many in here.

46
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,390
- Hey! Come back!
- You too!

47
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,055
Ow!

48
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,568
What is this place?

49
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:07,004
Even if you don't want to eat, you should.
You won't get any more after this.

50
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:09,872
Your TV is nice.

51
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,715
So is your dick!

52
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:41,571
It's time to shit!

53
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,576
- Shit?
- Shit.

54
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,179
I really don't want to right now.

55
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,649
- It'll come out anyway.
- Huh?

56
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,715
This music won't make it come out.

57
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,282
- It'll come out.
- It won't.

58
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,260
- It'll come out.
- It won't come out!

59
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:11,292
Something is sucking...
It's sucking it out!

60
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,032
Relax.

61
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,341
What a weird feeling.
It was gross, but it felt good.

62
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,747
Will you let me put it in too?

63
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,685
Coming!

64
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:36,360
Hey! Prisoner number 931!

65
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,758
9- 3-1!

66
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:39,491
Huh?

67
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,228
You! You shat too much!

68
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:44,668
Look! Your tube is all backed up!

69
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,667
It really stinks!
Your head is useless!

70
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:52,371
Your personality is disgusting!
I sentence you to death!

71
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,072
777!

72
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:05,246
Wow!

73
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:08,192
You're all just damaged clones!

74
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:13,759
You aren't worth as much as shit!
Shit! Understand?

75
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:17,395
Now slide out like shit!
Shit! Assholes!

76
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:20,201
Shit, I'm done.

77
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:42,259
It's best not to piss off
Three-Six and Three-Seven.

78
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:44,991
Their heads and bodies
are built differently from ours.

79
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:50,191
Don't misunderstand anything they say.

80
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,036
We're all genetic mistakes,
and they treat us like guinea pigs.

81
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:57,902
I see. I'm a clone.

82
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:01,079
There's nobody here who isn't a clone.

83
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:03,481
It's okay.

84
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,715
If we die today, tomorrow there will be
another batch of clones just like us.

85
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,450
It's okay to die anytime.

86
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,559
Are you okay?

87
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:22,727
Heh! I'm a doctor!

88
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:26,637
I made so many mistakes during surgery
that lots of people died, so they sent me here.

89
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,003
How about you?

90
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,941
Me? I lost my memory,
so I have no idea.

91
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:34,276
I woke up naked outside on a street.

92
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,781
You can't remember anything at all?

93
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:40,820
Well, I do remember one thing.

94
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,151
It's probably from a child's book.

95
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:46,488
It's a story about caterpillars
looking up at tree leaves.

96
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,427
Then some working ants
said to the caterpillars:

97
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:53,159
"Hey, you! If you're always looking up,
won't your necks get tired?"

98
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:57,430
Your bodies are so stretched out
because you're always looking up.

99
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:01,297
If you stretch too much, you'll break.

100
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,774
I'll sew you back together.

101
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,338
We won't need anesthesia...

102
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:16,714
Wow!

103
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,588
If you don't quit daydreaming,
you'll be next!

104
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,924
They're really messed up.
I won't let that happen to me.

105
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:29,864
It's called the "mutation gene,"
which is pretty easy to say.

106
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:32,370
They illegally tamper
with the body's appearance genes

107
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,703
so that we become ugly mutants.

108
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,971
They can do what they want because
nobody in the sky cares what happens.

109
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:44,483
If we had a fight, who'd be stronger?
Shit! Shit! Shit!

110
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,109
What's wrong with you?

111
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:54,950
Warden, today we took eight samples,
had 15 deaths,

112
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:59,124
three copies and five breakdowns.

113
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,888
I'm getting bored.

114
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,331
Quit it.

115
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:43,004
What are you doing?
There's nothing we can do in this position.

116
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,135
We have those holes
for shitting, remember?

117
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:50,746
Idiot!

118
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,050
Wrong!

119
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:59,455
Sorry!

120
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:04,552
How did we know how to do that?

121
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,186
Whatever.

122
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:11,187
That was incredible!
That was amazing sex!

123
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,960
How did you know
how to get out of your shackles?

124
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:16,798
- I don't know.
- Please take us with you!

125
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,098
Ah, okay.

126
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,790
Boss! Master! Mother!

127
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,589
General! Mistress! Brother!

128
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:47,490
Boss! It was you
who gave us our freedom.

129
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:51,298
We would be honored
to dedicate our lives to you.

130
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:54,101
Now give us your instructions.

131
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,876
What are you talking about?

132
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,241
A master with no memory.

133
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:03,544
No! That sex you had was amazing!

134
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:09,885
You snapped our shackles with such ease!
You were born to be our leader!

135
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:12,220
Your capabilities as a leader
are as big as my dick!

136
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:16,388
Oh, yeah! We must have been yakuza
before we lost our memories!

137
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:17,953
Hmm... maybe so.

138
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:22,400
That's definitely it! We did a lot of bad things,
so they eventually caught us!

139
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,767
We are pretty villainous.

140
00:15:24,838 --> 00:15:26,931
All right!
We've solved the mystery!

141
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,997
But I don't think that's totally right...

142
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:33,940
Listen up! Since I'm the boss,
you will do anything I want you to!

143
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,709
It's up to me whether you live or die!

144
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:39,581
- I'll do anything I want, as much as I want!
- That's it?

145
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:45,515
Okay, first we have go to the port
and get a ship.

146
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:49,923
Prison break! Prison break!

147
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,727
What the hell?

148
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:58,068
Here you go!

149
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:08,746
Warden! Well, Big Sister,
the show has begun.

150
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:11,443
Now for chapter one...

151
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:21,222
Boss! Is this the right way? Here!

152
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:24,320
Uh... it's fine if it's close.

153
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,728
Our boss always knows!

154
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:33,633
What the hell is this?
Get the fuck out of the way, jerkoff!

155
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:38,643
Huh? Won't the elite clone overseer
please let us pass?

156
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:09,925
They're coming out
like machine gun bullets.

157
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:13,558
It never ends!

158
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:16,996
We have to get out of this place now!

159
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,334
Okay, everyone! Let's run!

160
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,573
Hold on to the back of this bike!

161
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:27,473
Aw! The Boss is the only one
who gets to ride!

162
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:36,188
Ow! Ah! Geh!
Boss, my face is burning!

163
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:45,087
- Boss, it's too narrow!
- Deal with it!

164
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,665
- What is this?
- It's a passage for cargo.

165
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:02,681
Okay. If we take this passageway straight,
we'll go right to the port!

166
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:08,317
Aren't you a little late?
Your next opponent is waiting.

167
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:13,682
What's going on?

168
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,695
- It's huge!
- And so smooth.

169
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:26,862
Wow, Boss!
A robot! A robot!

170
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:29,334
Run! Run!

171
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:40,278
It's here! Run!

172
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:43,015
It's going to eat us!

173
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:57,759
I'll take care of it!

174
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:04,275
Chinko!

175
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:05,376
Yeah!

176
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:08,438
Give me your dick!

177
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,708
Ready!

178
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:15,080
Where do I put it in?
Is the ass okay?

179
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,746
That's not what I meant!

180
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,184
In that vent!

181
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:23,285
Darn!

182
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:36,573
It's narrower than before, Boss!

183
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,738
I can't take it!

184
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,904
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

185
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,743
It feels good to be squeezed!

186
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:26,084
It's incredible that
the armory was in there!

187
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,820
How did you know
it was there, Boss?

188
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,361
I don't know!

189
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,627
I'm good with this.

190
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:39,627
They're rather tough.

191
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:43,673
They're very energetic
for being in cold sleep for years.

192
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:45,176
But now it gets serious.

193
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,745
Let's see if you can get us there!

194
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:00,915
Sergeant, are you okay?

195
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:23,807
A train!

196
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:26,818
- A train! A train!
- This will definitely take us to the port!

197
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:29,880
Get on! Get on! Hurry up!

198
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:33,458
Departure!

199
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:38,455
Pandy!

200
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:56,376
Pandy!

201
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,158
Scumbag, eat this!

202
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:31,472
How's it going?

203
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,314
Boss! Can we really
reach the port this way?

204
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:35,820
Absolutely!

205
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:37,446
Definitely.

206
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:48,059
Why? Why do we know so many things?
Like where the armory was.

207
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:52,867
We must have been to this prison before.

208
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:54,906
Before we lost our memories.

209
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:03,338
Well, we were Yakuza, after all!
We must have been put away here.

210
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:35,241
Oh, Heaven, please forgive us
for our violent words and actions.

211
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:37,646
It's pretty late for that now.

212
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:39,685
Well, let's kill them all!

213
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,950
Big Sister, it's Chapter 3.

214
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,785
Get ready to stand by.

215
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:46,916
I'm ready.

216
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:58,669
Cheers!

217
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,470
What the hell?

218
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,774
Next to the armory
was a liquor storage room!

219
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,678
Hey! Is there a doctor here?

220
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:11,341
I'm a doctor.

221
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:18,651
She said she felt bad,
and suddenly started puking.

222
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,625
Her belly is so big!
She's pregnant!

223
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:23,924
Yay! Yahoo! Congratulations!

224
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:26,760
It was so sudden.
When did this happen?

225
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:29,426
- If you think back a little...
- Huh? Me?

226
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,927
That was just a little while ago!

227
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:35,405
- So he came inside her?
- I envy him!

228
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:39,638
It could be a very good thing!
Your child carried the mutation gene.

229
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:41,873
The mutation gene is very powerful.

230
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:43,778
- What is that?
- You don't know?

231
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,282
I don't know.

232
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:48,712
- You really don't remember anything at all.
- No.

233
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:52,121
Let me explain then. Our past!

234
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:53,283
Yay!

235
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,758
In fact...

236
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:00,889
I'm a secret agent?

237
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:01,898
A spy?

238
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:05,494
I don't know for sure,
but that's what it seemed like.

239
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:08,199
You both were here years ago.

240
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:14,611
And for some reason the warden
made you do secret work for the prison.

241
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:20,145
That all ended one day years ago.
That day, I...

242
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:21,413
A secret agent!

243
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:25,116
Yay! The boss is a spy! A spy!

244
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:26,123
Ow!

245
00:27:26,192 --> 00:27:29,491
What? Your red eye is throbbing, isn't it?

246
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:30,620
Something is nearby...

247
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:33,995
You're having a reaction...
It's those two for sure.

248
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:38,594
The children of the mutation gene,
the last of the living weapon experiments.

249
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:41,435
Three-Six and Three-Seven.

250
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:45,034
The Grim Reaper is obsessed with you two.

251
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:46,567
Huh?

252
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:04,618
What the...

253
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:07,257
- This isn't the way to the port!
- What?

254
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,995
We're heading
in the opposite direction of the port!

255
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:11,764
Stop the train!

256
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:15,472
- Can't you put on the brakes?
- Do something!

257
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:17,703
Pandy!

258
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,175
- It's them.
- Them?

259
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,812
Band together!

260
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,078
Now you will all die!

261
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:32,214
This is revenge for the Sergeant!
Fire! Fire!

262
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:35,626
You'll never hit me!

263
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:39,954
That's impossible!

264
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,890
You don't listen.

265
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,079
I told you I'd kill you all!
Your stupid little bullets have no effect on me!

266
00:29:05,658 --> 00:29:09,219
You do a good job.
Now let's get it on for real.

267
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:10,819
Boss is a spy! A spy!

268
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:14,591
We seem to have
some things in common,

269
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,931
but it doesn't look like
we're going to be able to talk.

270
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:19,527
If we don't kill you
then we will surely die.

271
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:38,782
I'll get your panties off!

272
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,751
I love your panties.

273
00:30:06,986 --> 00:30:09,045
- Boss!
- Are you all right?

274
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,081
Now do a line dance!

275
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:19,157
You lower yourself to that level.
It's dirty!

276
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:25,901
- Where are we?
- The factory.

277
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:27,603
What the...

278
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:30,942
This is the prison's secret work...

279
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:37,111
using genetic engineering to illegally create
living weapons through the mutation gene.

280
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:39,707
Through black market dealing with armies,

281
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:43,380
the warden supported
a very good life for himself.

282
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:48,483
Eight years ago, there was a terrible incident
in the factory with the mutation gene.

283
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,054
You happened to be there at the accident,
and the gene was lodged in your eye.

284
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:56,898
I remember now. I was reading a book
to someone after her father was gone.

285
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:59,597
The sad caterpillars in the children's book.

286
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:02,436
When they grow up
they can fly up to the leaves.

287
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:06,501
They have to eat a lot
until their green skin is broken open.

288
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:09,877
She thinks I killed her father.
She's revised history.

289
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:11,807
So it's revenge.

290
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:16,378
So I want you to kill
that trouble-making creature!

291
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:17,752
That filthy whore!

292
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:20,519
Wait! I can't do that for you!

293
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:26,597
So you're still alive, Doctor Yabu.
Now die!

294
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,761
Is that all of them?

295
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,041
Boss!

296
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,079
So strong! That's power!
No chance to win...

297
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:55,251
Shit! With my size and rigidity,
we will not be beaten!

298
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:56,555
Yes!

299
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:06,996
The robot got hacked?

300
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,597
But we can't keep
our honored guest waiting.

301
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:11,870
Eh? Still? Again?

302
00:32:13,512 --> 00:32:15,537
Now pray to God!

303
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,913
My God is drilling into your head!
Now you pray!

304
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:36,992
Your blessings are gone, clone scum!

305
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:01,221
It exploded?

306
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,261
Don't kill her!

307
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:43,723
Don't kill her...

308
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:46,031
Don't kill her...

309
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,346
You're too late.

310
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:42,552
It takes you a long time to remember,
doesn't it?

311
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:48,430
Hey, have you ever believed things for years
and were suddenly shocked to realize

312
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,958
that you completely had the wrong impression
or totally misunderstood them?

313
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:57,976
Never! You're playing with me.
I've never made a mistake.

314
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:00,908
You got your stubbornness
from your father.

315
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:03,413
It's been eight long years.

316
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,609
Am I in time?

317
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,446
What's happening?

318
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:15,391
It looks like we were
in cold sleep for years.

319
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,360
Huh? Really?

320
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,289
So that's why we can't remember anything.

321
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:24,699
Eight years ago there was
a violent incident at this factory.

322
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,639
We escaped, but the capsule malfunctioned
and made an emergency landing on Earth.

323
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,573
I don't get it at all.

324
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,809
Well, no point in talking about the details.

325
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,017
But it is funny.
You and I were fighting over your father.

326
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,545
Huh? So she's your ex-boyfriend's daughter?

327
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:45,981
You slut!

328
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:50,988
That was years ago,
but I remember it like it was yesterday.

329
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:55,261
It was yesterday to me.
Doesn't matter. I don't care.

330
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:58,667
Now give me the mutation genes
in your right eye.

331
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:03,504
They're really Papa's, after all.
If I get them I can complete his plan.

332
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:06,473
No way. N-O.

333
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:09,637
Well, let's fight then, shall we?

334
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:13,446
This body I got from Papa
will help me kill you and take that eye.

335
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,978
I have to warn you first:

336
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:19,023
I couldn't care less
about that perverted old freak.

337
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,082
I don't care what you did
for those years either.

338
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:25,191
You're being selfish as usual.

339
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:28,664
Still the same idiot opponent.
Sorry, but I won't let you get me.

340
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:33,868
I don't want to do this.
I really just want to sleep. See ya.

341
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,997
Hey! You seem like you're mad,
but are you okay?

342
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:40,943
I can't see out of my right eye.
My belly hurts really bad too.

343
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:42,537
You need to get out of here.

344
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:43,239
Huh?

345
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:52,516
This is a reversal for you.
There's no reason for us to have to fight.

346
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:56,055
Very well. I'll give you a reason.

347
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:20,417
It's reacting!

348
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:25,289
The power is far beyond our expectations!

349
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:27,518
I really want it now!

350
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:49,745
Having to work for it
makes me happy!

351
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,975
How's this?
Things change over the years.

352
00:39:04,923 --> 00:39:06,151
Not bad.

353
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:24,205
What is it? Are you hungry?
Is it the grippe?

354
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:29,672
Uh, belly? A baby?

355
00:39:29,748 --> 00:39:33,445
Of course.
It's the child of a mutation gene carrier.

356
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:35,452
That's the best material!

357
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:43,017
You don't need that right eye anymore.

358
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:46,586
All of the genes are being pulled
into that baby in your belly.

359
00:39:46,665 --> 00:39:50,567
This is the completion of the plan
that Papa created and I have kept alive.

360
00:39:52,437 --> 00:39:54,496
Goodbye, Big Sister.

361
00:40:04,883 --> 00:40:07,818
Huh? What the hell?
I don't have a body!

362
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:10,754
Madam...

363
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,221
Madam...

364
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,520
What is up with you?
You survived.

365
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:17,153
I see you did too, in that special form.

366
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:19,129
- What do you mean?
- Look!

367
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:22,598
- It's glowing!
- Pandy?

368
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,528
Madam...

369
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:58,159
Mother...

370
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:01,905
Retro, you survived?

371
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:04,635
Yeah, but if you don't get me surgery
for my body...

372
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:07,405
Isn't there something that you can use
instead for the time being?

373
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:15,683
- Eaten...
- Nothing I see shocks me anymore.

374
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,399
Papa!

375
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:41,345
She wants to follow the children's book.

376
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:45,850
"The huge caterpillar grew
into an even larger butterfly."

377
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:49,944
Well, it's not great,
but this will do for my body.

378
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:51,079
It fits you.

379
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:54,455
I can't do anything with this.

380
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:58,724
What in the hell...?
That thing is bigger now!

381
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:04,294
Well, as usual,
it's not that I feel no responsibility.

382
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:08,305
Hurry up and let's get the hell out of here!

383
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,904
Mother!

384
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:13,301
Mama!

385
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:19,149
I think the only way to do it is to jump
it in its mouth and set off an explosion.

386
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:22,277
Isn't that a good way
for all of us to die too?

387
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:25,050
Mama...

388
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:28,516
Papa...

389
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:07,253
- Are you okay, Pandy?
- It's no good. I'm too weak.

390
00:43:07,332 --> 00:43:11,530
Hey! Hey!
There's no atmosphere around us!

391
00:43:11,603 --> 00:43:12,763
Wait!

392
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:17,501
I don't really understand any of this,
but son, we can't let you go alone.

393
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:21,740
Papa...

394
00:44:28,146 --> 00:44:31,479
It's really sad.
We just had a baby and all.

395
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:36,348
He went from conception to birth
to old age to death in one day.

396
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:37,820
I don't really feel anything.

397
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,983
Look. Now the Moon
is even more worm-eaten.

398
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,786
I wonder what we really are.

399
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:52,227
I know what happened years ago,
but I still can't remember it myself.

400
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:56,698
Were we really spies or just bad guys

401
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:58,765
or clones or what?

402
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:01,209
Does it really matter?

403
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:10,216
It doesn't really matter, does it?

404
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,263
We're away from the surface of the Moon.
Hull integrity has been compromised!

405
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,460
We've entered Earth's atmosphere!

406
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:28,704
Wah! Crap! Crap!
Where is the firefighting equipment?

407
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:32,710
Emergency procedures initiated.
Emergency procedures initiated.

408
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:35,337
Automatic cold-sleep system engaged.
