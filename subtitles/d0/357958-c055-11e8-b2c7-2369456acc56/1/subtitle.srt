17
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,914
So what? I like it.

18
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,185

It's pretty. That pink flower dress.

20
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,363
Hey you!

21
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,596
- Ji-hoon!
- Ji-hoon!

22
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:55,265
Hey?

23
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,945

30

To pretty darlings I can't have enough

31
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,187
I enchant them with my magic

32
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,595
and they get excited

33
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,255
Love is magic.

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,023
You know it's a trick

35
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,086
but having you believe
in it anyway.

36
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,370
Asshole.

37
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,942
When the magic is over,

38
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,345
I just get ready for
the next performance.

39
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,577
But why the face?

40
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:13,042
Why not make a career out of it?
You'll do quite well.

41
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,515
Look! The light is coming in this way.

42
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,018
Then you see shades

43
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,418
here and here,

44
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,682
under the chest.

45
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,355
And...

46
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,415
Stoop down little bit!

47
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,687
And it's dark right here.

48
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,589
Look at his stomach!

49
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,528
Don't you guys have the feel for it?

50
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,192
He must be getting a hard-on.

51
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,525
Ms. Koo,

52
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,596
could you caress me too?
Please baby...

53
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,442
Why don't you draw with your mouth!

54
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,243
I guess she was doing him
with her mouth.

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,908
Then

56
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,417
Then what?

57
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,350
The guy couldn't stand
and came in her mouth. Ha ha.

58
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,690
So what happened?

59
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,191
She swallowed it alright.

60
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,194
Swallowed what?

61
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,023
You know.

62
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,701
Hey, people can eat just about anything.

63
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,916
Could you open your mouth?

64
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,417
Ah...

65
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,266
It's all done.
Time for gargling.

66
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,350
Hey, Doc!

67
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,081
I keep bleeding...

68
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,079
What's wrong?

69
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,019
I'll be damned.

70
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,359
The pain is gone.

71
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,272
Yes?

72
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,410
I'm sorry. I'll be there in a minute.

73
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,021
Ah, it was you.

74
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,090
I'll move the car right away.

75
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,688
Where did it go?

76
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,197
I swear it was right here.

77
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,101
It was right here...

78
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,108
Ah, you naughty thing was there.

79
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,178
I'll get to it right away.

80
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,186
I guess I can store your number?

81
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,581
"Let's meet.
I can make you scream my name."

82
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,082
"I gotta see your junior first.
Take your clothes off."

83
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,430
Never been second best in my life!

84
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,441
Ha, do you like what you see, girl?

85
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,019
You freaking pervert. Fuck.

86
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,250
So you're a ninja turtle this time?

87
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:29,198
How come you're home so early?

88
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,436
Boning women not going so well?

89
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,439
There are two kinds of women.

90
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,101
The ones you can get into pants
with a single try

91
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,043
and the ones that require more effort.

92
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,677
No such girls you can't have.

93
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,024
What's going on?
Treating me to dinner all of sudden?

94
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,529
Why not?

95
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,930
A friendly gesture from a good friend.

96
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,697
You must have a favor to ask.
What is it?

97
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,202
Why don't you open it?

98
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:17,914
Joon-seok.

99
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,417
I don't want to leave anything
to regret anymore.

100
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,511
I don't want you to think
I'm just your friend either.

101
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,921
I can no longer hide
what I'm feeling.

102
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,258
I don't look too shabby,

103
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,027
make good money,

104
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,035
and have good personality too.

105
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,435
Turned you off little bit?

106
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,445
I've thought about this
for a long time.

107
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,680
Doctor?

108
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,251
Yes.

109
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:04,523
I heard kissing is great for
preventing tooth decay. Is it true?

110
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,192
That's true.

111
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:15,373
Then your kiss much be
a better tonic.

112
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,081
Aren't we going too fast?

113
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,516
So we'll have time
for a prequel and a sequel.

114
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:44,034
Korean candid cameras...

115
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,264
Now, that's the real thing.

116
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,602

118
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,944
I don't care if they film me.

119
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,913
Wanna do it for real.

120
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,177
Great picture quality.
Oh, yeah~

121
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,202
What the fuck?

122
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,418
Hold on.

123
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,929
I'm busy man.
Call me later.

124
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,430
Where are you now?

125
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,091
Me? Well...

126
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,203
You're at a motel, right?

127
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,932
Get your fat ass out now.

128
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,202
I'm about to come...

129
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,209
You got caught by a candid camera!

130
00:12:59,211 --> 00:12:59,939
What.

131
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,677
Candid camera! Don't you get it?

132
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,417
That's me, right?

133
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,690
Damn it... I'm fucked...

134
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,526
Why don't we go to the police?

135
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,697
Do you want to see me
royally screwed?

136
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,064
Why don't we hang a poster?

137
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,598
The Candid Camera
Magician Woo Ji-hoon.

138
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,684
Doing this looking at me
in action...

139
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,526
Ah, I just blew my nose...

140
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,599
This is not cool, you beast.
Blew your nose!

141
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,106
What? Are you a freaking elephant?

142
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,110
Wait a second...
What if your partner goes to the police?

143
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,083
You don't even know who she is.

144
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,037
- Who is it?
- An upperclassman from a school circle.

145
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,538
Why now all of sudden?

146
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,368
He said he's been interested in me
for a long time.

147
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,104
Seven years?

148
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,543
Are you sure he's not a stalker?
What a turnoff.

149
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,010
No.

150
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,916
There were plenty of girls
going after him.

151
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,517
What does he do?

152
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,351
He's a plastic surgeon.

153
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,352
Girl! Hold onto him tight!

154
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,019
Don't ever let go!

155
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,586
Didn't you just say?
He was a turnoff?

156
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,261
Whoever makes more than
10K a month is a great catch.

157
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,599
I envy you, you bitch.

158
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,541
But? I'm not sure.

159
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,442
You want to teach
when you're an old hag?

160
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,376
Don't play hard-to-get
and get on it.

161
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,682
If he wants to drink with you,
get drunk.

162
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,411
If he takes you to a hotel,
go along like you don't know anything.

163
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,685
Give him what you have to give him.
Then get him on a leash!

164
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,418
Your life won't be the same.
Got it?

165
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,257
You slut...

166
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,194
Ladies.

167
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,096
This place is hot!

168
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,100
Two sexy men are looking for a date.

169
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,602
If they aren't, we won't
come here again.

170
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,533
The ones who are taken want more.

171
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,911
What!

172
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,250
- Hey, you!
- Teacher...

173
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,709
Ha~ Always tastes great.
Come on!

174
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,036
- Pardon?
- I said drink up.

175
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,679
Bottoms up!

176
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,515
Oh you cutey.

177
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,185
Already know how to drink.

178
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:42,700
You kiddo with an old man's face.
And a clubbing stud.

179
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,198
Life is good!

180
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,268
I think you're past the age for clubbing.

181
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,111
I know how badly
you wanna fool around at your age.

182
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,243
Look at you and
your wind-blown hair.

183
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,182
We both have nothing to be proud about.
Let's let it lie.

184
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,190
- Okay?
- Yes.

185
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,096
Just eat your noodles boy.

186
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,437
Ah~ It's good.

187
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,508
You have a death wish,
don't you?

188
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,085
Sweetie...

189
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,420
Why?

190
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,423
Hold on.

191
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,082
Hello?

192
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,258
Your homepage is quiet.

193
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,269
I guess no one saw it yet.

194
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,348
You're something. You can't possibly
remember all those chicks, can you?

195
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,010
Shut up.

196
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,079
What was the name?

197
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,346
Tae-hee?

198
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,184
No...

199
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,530
Soo-jin?

200
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,257
Bora? I'm going nuts...

201
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,608
Sleeping already?

202
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,111
Sleeping already?

203
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,020
Let's break up!

204
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,088
Hey,

205
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,100
high school?

206
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,368
That high school!

207
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:34,697
What?

208
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,431
Remember I did a performance
at a high school festival last year?

209
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,712
That teacher!

210
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,078
I thought it was all over?

211
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:50,248
I really was a fool back then.

212
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,083
Hey?
What are you doing!

213
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,593
Hold still. I'm sorry, Seon-hee.
You're something...

214
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,933
- Seon-hee.
- What?!

215
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,200
Why did he come to see you?

216
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,366
He wants us to go out again.

217
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,675
After a year?

218
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,906
Said he kept thinking about me.

219
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,248
That sound so romantic~

220
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,686
Romantic my ass.

221
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,686
Are you going to see him again?

222
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,917
Do you think I'm on drugs?
No way.

223
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:34,362
Why not?
So romantic.

224
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,697
An old love has returned.

225
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,699
Hee-won, why don't you
grow up.

226
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,602
There's only one reason men
seek their old love.

227
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,110
When he can't control
his sexual drive,

228
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,271
Doesn't earn enough
and doesn't have women around her.

229
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,249
That's when they look for old love.
Why? 'Cause it's so easy.

230
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,683
How convenient!

231
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,019
Don't believe it...

232
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,040
- Going to the Classroom #8, right?
- Yeah.

233
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,942
Ms. Kim, you don't have
a class now?

234
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,242
What are you gonna say?

235
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,515
It's been a while...
How have you been?

236
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,350
By the way,

237
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,360
you know we're in
a candid camera. Crap.

238
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,934
Hee-soo.

239
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,204
It's Hee-won.

240
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,177
I guess you don't know yet?

241
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,011
Don't know what?

242
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,412
Never mind. Ignorance is bliss.

243
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:44,088
No, wait.
You have the right to know.

244
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,262
Listen hard to what
I'm about to say.

245
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,930
Few days ago...

246
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,942
I saw a porno on the internet...

247
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,376
And...

248
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,342
You horny asshole.

249
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,180
Why don't you do it to yourself?

250
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,410
What are you saying!
We're on film!

251
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,419
What?

252
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,083
Have you seen the candid camera?

253
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,354
I don't. You pervert!

254
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,522
Listen.

255
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,193
You and I,

256
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,933
in a motel...

257
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,025
We got caught!

258
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,039
What? Talk to me.

259
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,938
We're on film!

260
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,375
You and I doing it.

261
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,008
Do you think I'll be lying?
About this?

262
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,082
I think you're certifiably crazy.

263
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,185
Do you have a better idea?

264
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,697
We can't get a laptop right away.

265
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,531
Internet cafe doesn't work either.

266
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,592
It's safest this way.

267
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,933
If this is a practical joke,
you'll get it.

268
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,089
Enough. Turn it off.

269
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,198
- Hee-won.
- Seen enough. Turn it off!

270
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,108
- Hey, you know.
- This...

271
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,915
You got this from the internet?

272
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,418
Yes.

273
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,014
Talk to me.

274
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,350
Let go.

275
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,694
Not sure if it's appropriate to talk

276
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,197
about this now...

277
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,529
You're home...

278
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,206
This isn't my home.

279
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,010
Hey, where are you going?

280
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,917
Hee-soo!

281
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,421
I mean, Hee-won!

282
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,517
I'll take you home! Hey!

283
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,426
Hey, Woo Ji-hoon!

284
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,933
What a surprise?

285
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,571
Ah? So this is where you live...

286
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:28,176
Hee-won, why don't you come down?
For some fruits? Where is she?

287
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,431
Hey

288
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,700
Someone is here looking for you.

289
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,574
Who is it?

290
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,910
A girl.

291
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,416
Tell her I'm not here.

292
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,577
Already told her you were here.

293
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,583
You moron.

294
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,189
She looks familiar.

295
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,606
Let's go to the police.

296
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,181
- I said no.
- I meant for our marriage registration.

297
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:30,680
What?

298
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,008
Don't care if we get a divorce afterwards.
Let's get married first.

299
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,348
How can we get married?
Over something so trivial?

300
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,682
Trivial?

301
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,582
I mean?

302
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:46,027
- You and I take care of this quietly...
- Why don't we kill ourselves?

303
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,201
Then, why don't
we get the bastards?

304
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,362
Who?

305
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,535
The assholes who filmed us.
You're something...

306
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:06,248
- Should we get married?
- Let's get the crooks.

307
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,252
- But no police whatsoever.
- Same here.

308
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,083
What do we do now?

309
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,679
Remember when it was?

310
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,085
Don't know.
Let's look for the motel.

311
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,524
Motel?

312
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,190
- Do you know how many times we went to a motel?
- 17 times.

313
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,931
- What's that?
- It's my diary.

314
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,269
Didn't record in detail
but we'll know the area.

315
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,536
You mean to look through
all motels in the area?

316
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,271
Better than nothing.

317
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,673
Anyway, why did you write down?
All that?

318
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,079
Wanna die?

319
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,245
Car?
7 times...

320
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,187
Fewer than I thought.

321
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,089
Took out the car sex.

322
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,923
When do you think we were filmed?

323
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,521
I don't think it was the first one.

324
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,194
Of course not.
'Cause the first was a rape.

325
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,040
You have a way with words?

326
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,442
So where do we start?

327
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,543
Electronics Land.

328
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,421
You have a hidden camera
detector, right?

329
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:28,360
1GHz detection.
Success rate 99.9%. DJX2!

330
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,267
I'll take it.

331
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:35,366
Are people taking a lot of
candid camera films nowadays?

332
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,275
Don't mention it. It's crazy.

333
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,905
Some men do it for keeps.

334
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,421
- Sure it isn't you who filmed it?
- Hey, that's not funny...

335
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,185
In times like these,
we should trust each other.

336
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,422
We were lovers once you know...

337
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,194
Lovers my ass. Pay for it!

338
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,531
Don't worry.
I won't jump you.

339
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,444
Why don't we begin...

340
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,526
Seeing it for the first time?

341
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,690
Just get to it!

342
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,926
Nothing?

343
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,363
Let's go check out the next one.

344
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,369
Hey, we were here less than 5 minutes.

345
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,597
We don't have much time.

346
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:51,197
If we leave now,
people will look at me funny.

347
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,538
Why?

348
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,013
Are you done already?

349
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,348
What's up? Come on out now.

350
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,419
Please come often. He he...

351
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,682
Yo!

352
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,253
What are you thinking?
Would you hide the camera there?

353
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,258
Candid cameras live for the bed

354
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,022
where they have the best view of the bed.

355
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:49,089
Dresser! Ceiling! Next to a TV!

356
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,259
You should look into places like these.

357
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,029
If you're so smart, why did we get filmed?

358
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,253
It's free.

359
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,250
Want one?

360
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,195
- See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? Again?

361
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,593
And the day after.

362
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,697
You and I need to work...

363
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,207
Okay.

364
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,371
See you.

365
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,918
I'm home.

366
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,090
Heung-pyo is here again?

367
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,422
Hey, you pigs!

368
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,194
You're home?

369
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,601
Are you home, sister-in-law?

370
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,539
What sister-in-law?
Whose sister-in-law am I?

371
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,043
Keep this door open or you'll die!

372
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,412
- Wow, it looks so tasty...
- I'm glad.

373
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,244
- Thanks a lot, Mother.
- Take your time.

374
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,184
- Do you like sea food soup?
- Of course I do, Father.

375
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,189
- Try this too.
- Thank you.

376
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,024
Do you like me better or that silly guy?

377
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,587
He's good as our family now.

378
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,256
Watch what you say.

379
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,925
Our family?

380
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,435
We settled on their wedding date.

381
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,369
- Hee-won...
- Sister-in-law.

382
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,443
What's the hurry?
Did you get knocked up?

383
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,182
Watch what you say.
You're an older sister.

384
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,013
I'll be happy if you went out
and got yourself knocked up.

385
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,347
Me?

386
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,914
Seriously?

387
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,084
Do you even have a man
to do that with?

388
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,593
Of course I do.

389
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,689
Then bring him home!

390
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,408
Do you love our daughter?

391
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,016
No.

392
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:28,525
Then why are you trying to marry her?

393
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,356
You know,

394
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,521
we're stars on the internet.

395
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,191
Do you think I'm happy doing this?

396
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:41,432
Thank you for taking care of
our daughter... really.

397
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,374
Thank you

398
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,276
You know, I'll try.
But don't you expect too much.

399
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,013
You're welcome

400
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,418
You really are the best cook.
You're just saying it.

401
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,087
Hello

402
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,356
Hey, you gotta cover me.

403
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,593
Men are supposed to
pay for these kinds of things.

404
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,429
Who doesn't know that?
I'm out of money.

405
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,358
Hey! Constipation?!

406
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,941
What are you doing?

407
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,241
Need to ask you a favor.

408
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,508
What is it?

409
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,244
Can you go and get me a tampon?

410
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,348
Hey, you!

411
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,427
Was it good for you too?

412
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,202
Coming here without money?

413
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,674
No, you got it wrong.

414
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,179
He isn't talking to me.
What a funny guy.

415
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,016
Did you love it?

416
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,412
- This guy is a pervert!
- Are you happy?!

417
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,928
Koo Hee-won.

418
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,199
Thanks.

419
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,100
What did I do wrong in my last life...

420
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,246
You keep your mouth shut.

421
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,517
Too tired to talk.

422
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,426
Joon-seok?

423
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,929
Today?

424
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,204
I'm not feeling so well.

425
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,439
A friend of mine came to
my house and...

426
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,080
Where am I?

427
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,006
Where would I be?

428
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:20,080
Take a guess?

429
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:28,091
Why don't you take a guess.

430
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,700
- That girl...
- When were we supposed to meet?

431
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,705
What time is it now? Ah...

432
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,578
You seem worried.

433
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,518
No, I'm not.

434
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,349
Because of me?

435
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,023
Joon-seok?

436
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,418
I guess I popped
the question too suddenly?

437
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,427
That's not it...

438
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,594
I'm ready for your answer,
whatever it may be.

439
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,371
I waited 7 years.
But you just started.

440
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,705
Take your time.

441
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,514
Great night

442
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,431
Hold on. Wait.

443
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,368
Let's turn off the light first.

444
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,433
Get in, get in! Hurry!

445
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,535
- Hurry!
- What's wrong with you?

446
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,182
I'm sorry. It's not happening today.

447
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,528
Are you sure it was Choon-cheon?

448
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,434
We were dressed light. I'm sure.

449
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,543
Wasn't it time of the month for you?

450
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,505
- What does it say?
- What says what?

451
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,349
Your diary.

452
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,079
It must say something about me.

453
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,349
It says you're a playboy.
Happy now?

454
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:18,595
- Say it! Don't take it out on the car!
- Let's just get something to eat.

455
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,680
Still doing that?

456
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,679
I know what you're gonna say.
So don't.

457
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:37,581
If you don't eat that,
you'll wrinkle up real fast.

458
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,353
You're worried about me.
What an honor.

459
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:47,090
Why order seafood spaghetti
if you don't eat seafood?

460
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,030
That's the way I like it.
Leave me alone.

461
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,194
Why don't you order Jajang Noodle
and just eat noodles then?

462
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,103
You moron.
It's pronounced Jajang Noodle.

463
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,606
Jambon Noodle is Jambon
Noodle then?

464
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,435
Can't you be more childish?

465
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,350
You remember exactly
where it was?

466
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,423
Don't worry.

467
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,687
There is only one motel.

468
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,095
You said there was only one?

469
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,598
Where did they all come from?

470
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,600
No way we can find it.

471
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,340
Follow me.

472
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,347
I had to drag you there before.
Now you lead the way.

473
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,092
What are you doing?
Let's go check the next one.

474
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,429
Slow down, girl.

475
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,434
This was the ninth motel.

476
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:02,699
It's 5 o'clock already.
Gotta get back home before midnight.

477
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,273
There's no way we'll find it this way.

478
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,040
It's not gonna work.

479
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,911
Do you want to find it or not?

480
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,016
I'm not saying I don't want to...

481
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,915
Get off your butt now!

482
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:21,023
Alright. I'll go. You're killing me...

483
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:22,922
Hurry up!

484
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,437
- Sweetie.
- Hold on.

485
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,029
Wait?

486
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,207
I just can't do it.

487
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,243
Making it hard on me again.

488
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,340
- Move it, mister!
- Okay, okay. I'm coming.

489
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,578
Driving me nuts.

490
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,910
Walk faster.

491
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,259
Again? Give me a break.
I'm exhausted.

492
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,921
Exhausted for what?

493
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,258
You don't have to do anything.

494
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,196
Hurry up!

495
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,929
Okay, let's go inside...

496
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,916
This one isn't it either,
don't you think?

497
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,521
Let's go back.
It's getting too late.

498
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,097
Seeing again tomorrow?

499
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,428
Sure.

500
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,595
Then what?

501
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,700
Say what you wanna say.

502
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,276
Alright!

503
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,672
Say we found the motel.

504
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,415
Then what?

505
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,580
Hooray, we found them?
The end.

506
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:04,924
That's it?

507
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,032
Nothing's gonna change.

508
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,033
Two years max. We hope it doesn't
blow up for the next two years.

509
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,369
Should be fine afterwards.

510
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,534
Time cures all,

511
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,441
as people say.

512
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,174
What if it blows up?

513
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,581
And our families and friends find out?

514
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,086
I lose my teaching job

515
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:34,588
and can't get married either.
Then what?

516
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,182
That's your life.
What do you want me to do?

517
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,523
What did you say?

518
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,529
It's not my fault.

519
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,428
I can't be clearer about that.

520
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,101
We're already strangers.

521
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,343
What's wrong with her today?

522
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,089
What's the matter?

523
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,527
Hey, you have one too.

524
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,589
- I need to drive.
- Just call for a driver.

525
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:24,203
What?

526
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,936
She clings on you?

527
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,042
Who?

528
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,012
The girl on the candid camera.

529
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,343
She's not the kind.

530
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,242
What? Do you pity her now?

531
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,580
Man, it's not like you.

532
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,181
You won't bet an eyelash
even if the girl got pregnant.

533
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,358
What I'm saying is!

534
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,590
You two slept because you liked
each other.

535
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,258
It's no one's fault.

536
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,269
Anything happens
and girls blame guys.

537
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,934
Let's get down to it.
Did you film it?

538
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,203
Did you rape her?
Men are there for the taking?

539
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:04,008
Are we a prey?
Why is it all our fault?

540
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:06,674
That's true, isn't it?

541
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,078
Right?

542
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,244
Right?

543
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,921
You got old for nothing.
You're not a man.

544
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,085
What?

545
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,096
If I may, you did nothing right.

546
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,359
You were lucky you got filmed
only once.

547
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,425
It should've been thousands.

548
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,096
Women are there for the taking?

549
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:33,370
Are they a prey?
Why can't you leave them alone?

550
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,076
I think you've had enough.

551
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,011
The fucker now wants me
to stop drinking?

552
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,677
He made me drink before?
Holy shit...

553
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:46,685
What?

554
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,357
Don't you have pity on her?

555
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,518
All she did wrong
was falling in love with you.

556
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,928
You dumped her and hurt her.
Now she's on film. Her life is ruined...

557
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,091
What the hell are you doing?

558
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,102
You seduce a girl you don't even love
and then dump her.

559
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,935
You're a man so you don't care
if you're on film. Life is great for you.

560
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,005
Hee-won...

561
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,178
Hee-won!

562
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,248
Where the hell are you now?

563
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,202
Hey, it's Woo Ji-hoon.

564
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,268
Where are we going?
I want to dance.

565
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,903
Hey! Hey!!

566
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:47,575
Run, your horsey.

567
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:49,677
Out of the way.

568
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,186
Hold still.
We're getting soaked.

569
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,248
Woo Ji-hoon!

570
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,521
Where did you just touch me?

571
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,358
Your butt.

572
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,694
Don't you dare!

573
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,525
Stop it, please.

574
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,528
What are you looking at?

575
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,597
Do you know me?

576
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,608
You're making a scene.

577
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:18,579
An internet star, Koo Hee-won!

578
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,082
Let's go somewhere
and get some rest.

579
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,677
To a motel? That sounds great!

580
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,083
What the...

581
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,260
Hee-won.

582
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,020
I'm scared...

583
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,532
Of what?

584
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,363
Of people.

585
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,514
Just pop in any movie.

586
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,605
Two American coffees.

587
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,179
Drink it up.

588
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,585
Thanks.

589
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,026
What are we gonna do now?

590
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:45,527
Plastic surgery?

591
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,354
You don't need to.

592
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,366
Just erase your makeup
and no one will notice you.

593
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,026
Drop dead!

594
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:57,100
Don't you worry.
No one notices us.

595
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,437
Just beware of those around us.

596
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,034
Once they get to know,
it's gonna be one big headache.

597
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,506
Do you have people around you
who watch porno often?

598
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,413
My students.

599
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,581
You must be worried.

600
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,088
Let's go the other way.

601
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,591
Hee-won!

602
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,523
Hee-won!

603
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:21,590
Seon-hee!

604
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,928
You girl. Hee-won!

605
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,199
Hurry up and go wash yourself.

606
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,274
I've heard so much about you.

607
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,175
Yes?

608
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,078
You're a plastic surgeon,
aren't you?

609
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:43,175
- Seon-hee, actually...
- Doctor, my complex is here.

610
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,016
Putting it up just a little.

611
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,079
- How much would that be?
- Seon-hee.

612
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:52,927
Why are you sitting next to me?

613
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:54,519
- Get over there.
- That's okay.

614
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,032
Be yourself, girl.

615
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,431
Go on.

616
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:05,603
Now that's better...
You two look so great together.

617
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,269
Sorry I haven't introduced myself.

618
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:12,075
I'm Lee Seon-hee,
her colleague at school.

619
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,012
Got it...

620
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,416
Yes, but I am...

621
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,247
When are you getting married?

622
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,252
Seon-hee!

623
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,422
Darling!

624
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:22,684
Sorry, I'm late.

625
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,257
- Sit here.
- Thanks.

626
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,355
We had a company?

627
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,522
Let me introduce them.
You know Hee-won, right?

628
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,691
- Hello.
- Hello.

629
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,198
- Like I heard, you're great-looking.
- Thanks.

630
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,262
This is her husband-to-be.

631
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,365
Is that so? Nice to meet you.
I'm Kim Jae-jong.

632
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,034
Nice to meet you.

633
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,244
Don't they look great together?

634
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,906
Sure.

635
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:50,180
But they look familiar somehow...

636
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,916
It's because they look great together.

637
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,252
I guess so...

638
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:22,345
Don't you get near me ever again.

639
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:40,199
Don't you worry. I'll fix you up.
I'm a plastic surgeon for God's sake.

640
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,008
Right turn at the next intersection.

641
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,014
Where are we going? Tell me.

642
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,080
See a motel there?

643
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,416
At this hour?

644
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,028
Get ready for a surprise.

645
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,362
- Daddy.
- Yes.

646
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,101
Why don't you introduce yourself?
It's my Dad.

647
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,608
Glad to see you?

648
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,915
But, what's the money for?

649
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:35,017
Ah, I didn't get a present for you...

650
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,023
It's an allowance for you, Father!

651
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,084
Do you have a death wish or what?

652
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,263
What I meant was...

653
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:18,425
When a car is moving
and someone pops in front of it...

654
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,699
You little assholes...

655
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,307
You need an allowance, don't you?

656
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:32,007
I'll take care of it.
How much do you need?

657
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,249
Was it good for you too?

658
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,085
Help!

659
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:44,020
Does this make sense?

660
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:47,585
In a law-abiding country,
two high school punks beat up a citizen

661
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,359
in front of a motel in broad daylight? Huh?

662
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,596
What the hell are you looking at?

663
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,103
Still no idea what you got yourself into?

664
00:57:56,206 --> 00:58:00,438
Why don't you calm down?
They're still kids.

665
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:03,671
Kids? Look at their scary faces.

666
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,677
- These guys are punks.
- Well...

667
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,076
I'll have them put away to prison.
No settlement.

668
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:12,348
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

669
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,356
Are they your students?

670
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,697
What would you like to do?

671
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,698
Let's let it lie.

672
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:35,443
Can't you see my face?

673
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:39,242
They're punks.
Attacked me without provocation.

674
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,408
Why is it unprovoked!

675
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,418
You stay quiet.

676
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,078
Is that so?

677
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,351
Let me hear it.

678
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:53,361
Ms. Koo, I'm really disappointed.

679
00:58:54,597 --> 00:59:00,263
I saw it all with my own eyes.

680
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,429
What are you saying?

681
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,367
That asshole!

682
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:07,937
With our teacher!

683
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:09,206
In a motel!

684
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,678
That's enough!

685
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,579
We don't care and what's it to you?

686
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,577
Sir, I'll settle.

687
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:19,416
Pardon?

688
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:23,253
They're still kids.
I can let this pass by as an adult.

689
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,030
I saw them go into a motel together!

690
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,429
Hey! That motel!?

691
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:33,366
With my own eyes!

692
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,937
You mean us going into a motel?

693
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,703
Nothing else?

694
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,580
Saw nothing else, right? Right?

695
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:49,345
Hey kiddo. Your teacher can't
have a boyfriend all her life?

696
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,681
Are you gonna take care of her?

697
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,516
When people are in love,
they can go to such places.

698
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,026
That's not a bad thing to do.

699
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,359
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

700
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,695
This fucker is an asshole!

701
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,265
He went into a motel
with a different woman today.

702
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,358
Hey!

703
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,430
I wasn't there to...

704
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,203
Her father owns that motel.

705
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,209
It's her home.

706
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,338
Moron. Try a better excuse.

707
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,916
Shit, it's true.

708
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,352
Her father owns a motel.
I was surprised too.

709
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:31,353
I let them go because
I'm such a great guy.

710
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,592
Can't you be gentle?

711
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,027
If this leaves a mark...

712
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:40,035
Let me off at a nearby subway station.

713
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,367
Why? I'll drive you home.

714
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,099
No.

715
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,266
What's the matter?

716
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,610
What a great life you're having.

717
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,340
Are you still after skirts?

718
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,681
Not worried about the film, are you?

719
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,408
I'm going nuts.

720
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,182
Her father owns a motel. I'm serious.

721
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,019
Let me off here.

722
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,252
- I'll take you home.
- No, I said I don't want to.

723
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,526
Alright. Get off then.

724
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,429
Why aren't you getting off?

725
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,430
How can you tell me to get off for real?

726
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:34,589
I know it now

727
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:39,924
Your heart towards me.

728
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:45,365
My spirit which was dead,

729
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,097
I want to forget...

730
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:52,541
I'm but a lost sheep

731
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:57,068
in front of you...

732
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,245
Everyone was so good, weren't they?

733
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,582
- Yes, they were really good.
- Yes, they were.

734
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,349
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes.

735
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,186
What should we eat?

736
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,689
Woo Ji-hoon!

737
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,704
Aren't we running into
each other too often?

738
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:13,411
Didn't know she had
such famous friend.

739
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,082
You flatter me.

740
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,024
It's a small performance.

741
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,935
Does he perform magic for you?

742
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,438
Yes, sometimes.

743
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:37,170
You don't still do that car key trick,
do you?

744
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:46,678
It's chicken as you ordered.
Enjoy your meal.

745
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,517
- It's seafood spaghetti. Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

746
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:54,192
Can you take out seafood for me?

747
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:58,523
I guess you don't eat seafood.

748
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:02,535
Sure, my pleasure.

749
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:09,267
I heard you were a plastic surgeon?

750
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,902
Yes.

751
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,338
Great then.

752
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,179
Why don't you have him
take out a spot?

753
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,516
You have this huge spot
on your butt.

754
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:23,525
It's so big I thought
it was a birthmark.

755
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,096
You know

756
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,034
when we were kids,

757
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,700
we used to bath together,
like between close families.

758
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:42,036
Isn't it?

759
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,079
It's funny. Our families were like that.

760
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,245
Hyeon-joo,
don't you have a spot to take out?

761
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,011
What were you guys to each other?

762
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,247
Just friends.

763
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,420
I can't believe you.

764
01:04:56,425 --> 01:05:00,361
Hey, right there.
To the right. Little bit more.

765
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:04,024
To the right, I said! Come on.

766
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,440
It really is great.

767
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,358
When are you gonna do
your performance here?

768
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,087
If I want to, so can I.

769
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:38,097
You only do yours
at high schools.

770
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:42,531
Hey, this guy is doing it here
cause he got connections.

771
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,266
He's worse than me.

772
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,676
Why don't we go see it?

773
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,239
You go by yourself.

774
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,519
You small-minded man.
You must be blood type A.

775
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,521
- Go away!
- No!

776
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,524
- It's hot.
- Tough it out then.

777
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,024
He must think he's a prince
or something.

778
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:18,538
That's a disease,
looking at yourself and smiling.

779
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,273
Are you gonna hit me or what?

780
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,605
You should be on a run.

781
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,348
Five!

782
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,078
- Hey, we aren't kids.
- Four!

783
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,347
- Do you beat women too?
- Break up with him now.

784
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,514
- Three!
- He's driving me nuts.

785
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,251
Two!

786
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,519
Are you a gangster?

787
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,352
Shit!

788
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,531
I had a great time today.

789
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,541
Same here. Why don't you go in.

790
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,044
Drive safely.

791
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,413
Hee-won...

792
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,082
Is that guy a close friend of yours?

793
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,414
Who?

794
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,921
That magician friend.

795
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,084
No...

796
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,260
We are just friends, you know...

797
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,089
Let's get on

798
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,433
with our marriage.

799
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,519
Hello.

800
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,579
What are you doing?

801
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,692
Nothing. Why?

802
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,690
Why?

803
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,198
Does your girlfriend know?

804
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:56,693
Know what?

805
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,600
The candid camera.

806
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,377
She doesn't.

807
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:06,572
If she finds out,
will she still be in love with you?

808
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,082
I don't know.

809
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,176
If...

810
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:16,423
your girlfriend did it,
would you be understanding?

811
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,191
You'll probably get angry, right?

812
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:38,406
Lie still for two years,
and will everything be okay for real?

813
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,678
Aren't you gonna be on the edge?

814
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:49,013
Whoever you meet,

815
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,087
for the rest of your life...

816
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:59,360
What's wrong?
Anything happened?

817
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:02,199
- Hee-won.
- Sorry. I'm talking nonsense.

818
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,602
Bye...

819
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:22,515
Hee-won,

820
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,252
what are you doing tomorrow evening?

821
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,588
What's going on?

822
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,033
It's crazy, changing the repertoire
on the performance day.

823
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,037
You know how dangerous it is.

824
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,369
Why should I be worried when I have
such a capable manager in you?

825
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,200
I believe in you.

826
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,257
Just like everyone else,
I fall in love, lose love,

827
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,923
and cry at times.

828
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,363
What I'm about to show you is magic

829
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:06,925
by a man who almost
lost the woman he loves.

830
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,247
Thank you.

831
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:54,345
I'm going to need help
from the audience on this one.

832
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:55,685
Hopefully,

833
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:59,917
it's the most beautiful woman
in the audience.

834
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:19,932
What are you doing?

835
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,433
Where am I?

836
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:27,436
What are you doing?
You were to do this alone.

837
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,941
Hey, is this thing safe?

838
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:32,070
Not sure if it can handle
your weight.

839
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,409
Hold on tight.

840
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:36,915
Oh my God!

841
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,020
All set?

842
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,422
Yes, they're up on the stage.

843
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:25,422
You're now big time.
Doing a performance at such location.

844
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,195
Why? Was it touching?

845
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:31,262
Touching my ass.
It was all a planned trick.

846
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,008
Try it.

847
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,692
How did you do it?

848
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,083
It's a present.

849
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,920
You con artist.

850
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:00,085
Drink up.

851
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,574
Always like that when drunk...

852
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:25,517
You left it behind.

853
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:28,916
Come again.

854
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:41,932
You know Hee-won well, right?
Have you heard the rumor?

855
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:45,529
I'm sending you an email.
Check it out to make sure.

856
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,701
There are pictures too?
My Lord...

857
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,251
<i>It reads, "My 26th Birthday"</i>

858
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:48,600
Aren't you going to class?

859
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,364
Sure I am.

860
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,099
I'll get going.

861
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,082
Congratulations.

862
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:31,536
It's so pretty.

863
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:41,905
It's too small.

864
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,680
You don't know
your girlfriend's foot size?

865
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:50,686
And who gives shoes
as a present to his lover?

866
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:52,586
It's all superstition.

867
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,254
Then, I can run away
from you with these on?

868
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:57,522
Alright. I'll get you something else.

869
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,265
Why don't we test it?

870
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,537
Whether we break up or not...

871
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,071
Now we can never break up,
right?

872
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,094
Quiet?

873
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,369
It's arts theory today, right?

874
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,238
Killer body.

875
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:22,179
Big boobs?

876
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:32,025
Let me see it too.

877
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,924
No. It's my turn.

878
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:35,256
She's pretending nothing happened.

879
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:37,024
She's got some nerves.

880
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:45,198
But she does have a killer body.

881
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:52,671
Hand me the file. You promised.

882
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,907
I need to go to the teachers' office.

883
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,084
What the fuck?

884
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,090
You did that?

885
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:59,196
You crazy asshole.

886
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:03,909
You motherfucker!!

887
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:06,674
- You did it, didn't you, you dumbass.
- What?

888
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,405
- Why?
- Why? You bastards!

889
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:11,678
Because of you guys!

890
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:30,036
There's a strange rumor

891
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:33,096
going about.

892
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,374
Is it true?

893
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:39,513
What are you saying?

894
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:42,071
Whether it's true or not,

895
01:28:42,183 --> 01:28:44,242
it'd probably be the same.

896
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:47,520
Don't know what.

897
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:50,523
He broke class and beat us.

898
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:54,186
- Don't know who he is.
- Let me take that.

899
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:57,925
Hello, yes.

900
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:00,023
This guy is a total wacko.

901
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:04,098
He broke everything here.

902
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:05,263
Yes,

903
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:07,938
I'm the victim.

904
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:11,170
Hello? Hello?

905
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:14,237
What's all this crap?
I told you he beat me.

906
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,176
Don't want to hear all that.

907
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,083
What?

908
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:23,420
Got it.

909
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:27,357
Why don't you come
to the scene and we'll talk.

910
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,430
Sir, look.

911
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:35,931
Why don't you come on over.

912
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,703
We'll hold onto him.

913
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,699
Cops are on the way.

914
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,913
Get ready for jail, asshole.

915
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,680
You stupid fuckers.

916
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:09,355
The phone is turned off
and you're being transferred...

917
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:13,923
What's up?!

918
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:15,694
Are you alright?

919
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:17,427
Man, this is bad.

920
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:21,370
Who am I? Who's the Big Daddy?
Told you I was gonna get them.

921
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:22,534
You did? You're the man!

922
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:26,510
Oops, Sorry...

923
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:36,418
Were you going to keep it
under the wraps for good?

924
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:44,354
Did you expect me
to be so understanding?

925
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:49,202
Is that how you think of me?

926
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:53,599
You

927
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:59,241
toyed with me.

928
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,267
What's going on not picking up?

929
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,177
Do you know where I am?

930
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:33,406
I'm in a hospital.

931
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:35,675
Where should I start?

932
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:40,584
When you get this message,
pay me a visit to the hospital.

933
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:54,695
We were in love.

934
01:32:57,538 --> 01:33:01,941
We were in love

935
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:07,905
just like others.

936
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:25,359
This number is not in service.
Please check again...

937
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:32,437
You brought my clothes, right?

938
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,371
It's in a shopping bag...

939
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:42,071
Where's my car key?

940
01:33:45,186 --> 01:33:46,175
Here.

941
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,522
Where are you doing?

942
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:37,427
Hee-won!

943
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:48,204
Hee-won!

944
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:51,673
Hee-won!

945
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:20,596
If

946
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,069
I met Hee-won that day,

947
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:26,677
what would have I said?

948
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,013
That I love her?
That we get married?

949
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:35,018
I'm sorry?

950
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:38,180
Perhaps

951
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:41,593
I might not have been able to
say anything.

952
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:48,695
But it's not important

953
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:51,264
what I'd have said or not.

954
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:06,683
How would've

955
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:09,916
Hee-won replied?

956
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:28,440
I said you don't draw
with your mouth!

957
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:46,419
Alright sir. I'll get to it.

958
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:04,073
How can I help you?

959
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:06,237
The woman who was just here...

960
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:08,406
She just left.

961
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:12,178
Do you know what she was here for?

962
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:14,915
For a wedding dress.

963
01:38:15,022 --> 01:38:15,681
Got it

964
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:20,526
Not sure if it's appropriate to ask this...

965
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:25,087
When is the wedding date...

966
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:43,265
Hey,

967
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:45,233
Hey,

968
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:46,902
Woo Ji-hoon.

969
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,686
Hee-won!

970
01:40:39,099 --> 01:40:41,192
You were funny back there,
don't you agree?

971
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:58,580
So much better to make
a fool out of myself than...

972
01:42:07,087 --> 01:42:09,248
I don't deserve to say this.

973
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:14,251
But I missed you.

974
01:43:50,924 --> 01:43:53,518
- Ready?
- Of course.

975
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,920
Nothing here, is there?

976
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:42,365
- Hold on.
- Why?

977
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:00,519
Remember this clothe?

978
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:02,918
Sure.

979
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:05,931
The dress you bought me
when we first met.

980
01:45:08,201 --> 01:45:10,260
It does look pretty on you.

981
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:44,697
Hello.
Could you move your car?

982
01:45:44,938 --> 01:45:47,930
I'm sorry.

983
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:49,440
Hold on.

984
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:57,581
I'm sorry.

985
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,174
Can you move the car now?

986
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,516
Hold on.

987
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:09,595
I think I lost the key.

988
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:12,426
Have you seen mine?

989
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:15,695
Mister, I'm really in a hurry.

990
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:20,100
Got it. Don't wrinkle
your pretty face...

991
01:46:22,109 --> 01:46:25,340
Here they are.

992
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:31,073
What do you think you're doing,
you shorty!

993
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:33,243
I mean...

994
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:34,581
What a day.

995
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:38,516
Hey, girl!

996
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:41,584
- Just move your car!
- Sure...

997
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:56,369
Why? You don't have a room?

998
01:47:47,027 --> 01:47:47,686
We've met before,

999
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:50,693
haven't we?
