2
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
My name is Richard.

3
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
So what else do you need to know?

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,280
Stuff about my family or where l'm from?

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,920
None of that matters.

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,680
Not once you cross the ocean
and cut yourself loose,...

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,760
..looking for something more beautiful,
something more exciting,...

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,760
..and yes, I admit,
something more dangerous.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,800
So after 18 hours in the back of an airplane,...

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,280
..three dumb movies, two plastic meals,
six beers and absolutely no sleep,...

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,240
..l finally touch down...

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,720
- Hey, you! How about you?
- ..in Bangkok.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,520
Do you want to go to the waterfall?
Floating market!

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,640
1,500$. Cheap for you! Come on! Hey!

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Hey! Do you need somewhere to stay?

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,040
- l'll find my own place, thanks.
- What you want, man?

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,360
And this is it. Bangkok.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Good-time city.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
Gateway to Southeast Asia.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,280
Where dollars and Deutschmarks get turned
into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,760
Good time! Boy! Girl! Fucking!
No problem!

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,720
- This is where the hungry come to feed.
- You wanna drink snake blood?

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
Wait a minute. Did you say snake blood?

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Oh, yeah!

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,160
- No, thanks.
- What is wrong with snake blood?

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,080
- l just... don't like the idea.
- Maybe you're scared.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,880
- Afraid of something new.
- l just don't like the idea.

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,760
Like every tourist!

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
You want it all be safe.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Just like America!

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,680
So never refuse an invitation.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,240
Never resist the unfamiliar.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Never fail to be polite.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,280
Gentlemen,...

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
..that was excellent.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
And never outstay your welcome.

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,400
Just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
And if it hurts,...

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
..it's probably worth it.

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,120
Hey.

41
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
- Good evening.
- Hi.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,440
- Can l get a room, please?
- Yes.

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
(TV)

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
The only downeris,
everyone's got the same idea.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,880
We all travel thousands of miles...

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,000
..just to watch TV and check into somewhere
with all the comforts of home.

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
And you gotta ask yourself,...

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,880
We'll have this place cleaned up
in ajiffy, so don't you worry!

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
..what is the point of that?

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,960
(TV: bombs exploding)

51
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
(drops wash bag)

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,720
(Richard nervously clears his throat)

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
- Et voila!
- Thank you.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
Bonsoir.

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,360
Bonsoir.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,040
Good night.

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,120
And as for travelling alone,...

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,920
..fuck it!

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
lf that's the way it has to be,
then that's the way it is.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
(rhythmic bumping)

61
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,560
(man and woman groaning with pleasure)

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,320
(Scottish accent) Everybody happy?!

63
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,600
Everybody having a good time, eh?

64
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Fuck you! Fuck you!

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
(woman) Please shut up, OK?

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
(man) Bastard parasites!

67
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,440
Viruses!

68
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
That's fuckin' great! Cancers!

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Bastard cancers!

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,760
(martial arts cry)

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,640
(man) He! Tu vas fermer ta putain de gueule?!

72
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,240
(man) A big, chunky Charlie
that's eatin' up the whole fuckin' world!

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,160
- (bang)
- Hey!

74
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
(knocking) Hey, you!

75
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,120
- You got anything to smoke?
- No, l don't have anything to smoke!

76
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
That's no problem, pal, cos, er...

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,120
(sniffs) ..l've got loads of the fuckin' stuff.

78
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
- (thud)
- (man grunts)

79
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
(bottles clink)

80
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,040
Do ya understand what l'm sayin'?

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah.

82
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
No, you don't.

83
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,560
No, you're right. l don't.

84
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
(loudly) Ahh, that's better!

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
(softly) Thanks.

86
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,800
lt was the beach. You understand?

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,840
The beach. lt was too...

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,320
..beautiful. Too much input, too much...
sensation. l try to keep it under control,...

89
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,400
..but it just keeps spilling out
and spilling out and spilling out.

90
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
You see, erm...

91
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
..she's on an island.

92
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,320
And the island is... is perfect.

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,480
l mean... l mean, real perfection here.

94
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,880
l'm not just talking about... ''Oh, that's nice.''

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
lt's the real fuckin' deal, OK?

96
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
lt's perfect.

97
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,240
See, it's like a... a lagoon.

98
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Ya know, a tidal... lagoon.

99
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
See, it's sealed in by cliffs.

100
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,320
Totally fuckin' secret, totally fuckin'...

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
..forbidden.

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,360
And nobody can ever, ever,...

103
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
..ever, ever go there. Ever.

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
But a few people went,...

105
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,320
..once upon a time.

106
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,360
Men and women with ideals.
You understand?

107
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,640
l'm not just talking about the usual...
travellin' fuckin' wanks.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Do you believe in that place?

109
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,520
No.

110
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,880
But l guess you're gonna tell me
that l should, right?

111
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
lt does not fuckin' matter
what l think any more.

112
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
lt's up to you.

113
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,400
ldeals, eh?

114
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,600
We were just fuckin' parasites!

115
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,080
The big, chunky Charlie!

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
See, l was the one...

117
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
..that was trying to find the cure.
Procurer ofthe cure.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
l said to them ''You've got to leave.''

119
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,720
''You've got to leave this place.''

120
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,440
But they would not listen.

121
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,920
No offence an' all, but...

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,520
..you're fucked in the head, right?

123
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
(both snigger)

124
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Here, Richard.

125
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
lt's been nice knowin' you, man.

126
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Yeah. You, too.

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
(thud)

128
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
(electricity crackles)

129
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,120
Be careful! Electric... Electricity!

130
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,120
- Ma'am! Ma'am! (makes buzzing sound)
- Chill, man!

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,240
No worry!

132
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
(electricity crackles)

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,040
Hey! Man.

134
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
There is a letter for you.

135
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,000
A what?

136
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,880
Letter on your door.

137
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
No fuckin' way!

138
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,200
Do you...

139
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
- Hello?
- (knocks on door)

140
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
You hope...

141
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,760
..and you dream,...

142
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,560
..but you neverbelieve that
something's gonna happen for you.

143
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Not like it does in the movies.

144
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
And when it actually does,...

145
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
..you want it to feel different.

146
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,960
More visceral.

147
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,400
More real.

148
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
l was waiting for it to hit me.

149
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
But itjust wouldn'thappen.

150
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
(man) The name of Mr.Daffy Duck.

151
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Birthplace: Never Never Land.

152
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Gonna fuck up all the paperwork.

153
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
The police were pissed because he was
travelling under a false passport.

154
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Go ahead, sign the statement.

155
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,000
lt's OK.

156
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,200
lt just say he cut his wrists -
already dead when you found him.

157
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,400
But they didn'task me about the map, so...

158
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,000
No problem.

159
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,960
..l didn't tell 'em.

160
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
You have a nice day.

161
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,800
Good luck!

162
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Excuse me.

163
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Look... l mean,...

164
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,440
..this island may not actually even exist.

165
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,160
Even if it does, l don't know
if we can get there or not.

166
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,000
l just wondered if you wanted
to come with me.

167
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
That's all.

168
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
(Song ''Woozy'' by Faithless)

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(nervous sigh)

170
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,560
Hey! You wanna take a hike?

171
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Uh... a-a trip, a journey?

172
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
With y-your girlfriend and me?

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,200
l mean, the two of you and me. Together.

174
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,760
- l-l'm talking about the secret isla-...
- Hi.

175
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,120
Hi.

176
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,520
l just feel like everyone tries
to do something different, but...

177
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
..you always wind up doing the same thing.

178
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,520
l realised that l had absolutely no idea
of how l was gonna get there.

179
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,200
But Etienne...

180
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,640
l mean, l have to hand it
to the guy. He was great.

181
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,320
l mean, he organised
the whole thing - tickets,...

182
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,640
..timetables, the whole damn trip.

183
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,680
Bangkok to Surat Thani.
Surat Thani to Na Thon.

184
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Na Thon to Chaweng.

185
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,080
500 miles in 24 hours,...

186
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,560
..at less than 400 baht.

187
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
Trust me, that's a very good deal.

188
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,040
We were headed for the great unknown.

189
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,040
But to get there, we had to follow
the regular tourist trail.

190
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Song A little less pushin'
and shovin'

191
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,440
Song Take it easy

192
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,760
Song You could even gets leazy

193
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Song Come around

194
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,360
Song Watch a movie

195
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,960
Song With the sound down

196
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Song Andget woozy...

197
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,680
lt's arranged. Tomorrow morning. 1800 baht.

198
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,560
Ah, great man! Nice work!

199
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,520
There is one problem.
He will not take us to the island.

200
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,080
lt's in the national park
and it's forbidden to go there. But...

201
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,040
..we are allowed to travel to this one
to stay for one night.

202
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,240
Yeah... No, see, that's the wrong one.

203
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Yeah, l know that.

204
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,640
Right. But how do we get
from there to there?

205
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,400
- We swim.
- We swim?

206
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,960
Yeah. We leave our rucksacks
on this island and then we swim.

207
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,000
- You can swim, can't you, Richard?
- Of course l can swim.

208
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,400
- So no problem.
- So h-how far is it, though?

209
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
l don't know. One or two kilometres.

210
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,600
- Cool. Cool... Not far at all(!)
- Stop it, Richard. lt will be worth it.

211
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,560
An adventure. And just... the three of us.

212
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,920
(thunderclap)

213
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,600
Uh-oh.

214
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,440
(mocks Etienne's accent) ''Can you swim?''

215
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,120
''l can swim! Oh, yeah! l am French and
l have the beautiful girlfriend, too! Huh!''

216
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Great(!)

217
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,520
- Goddammit!
- (man) Locked out, huh?

218
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Yeah.

219
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
- (youth) Lost your key?
- Uh-huh.

220
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
- (man) Bummer!
- Yeah, bummer!

221
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,720
So, uh... you wanna
grab a beer or somethin'?

222
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
(thunderclap)

223
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,960
- You're better off without her.
- Sammy, how the fuck would you know?!

224
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
You've never even met her!

225
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,480
l'm just tryin' to help the guy
through the dark times.

226
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,160
- lt's not a problem.
- You see, Zeph?

227
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,400
- lt's not a problem.
- Change the fuckin' subject.

228
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,760
All right. Let's talk about how you spend
an hour in front ofthe mirror every day.

229
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, that's nice(!) You know this guy?
He likes to wipe his ass with tree leaves.

230
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,360
He thinks he's some sort of
jungle commando.

231
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,120
- Whatever.
- (Zeph) l swear to God!

232
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
- (Sammy) Whatever.
- Damn!

233
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,080
l presume...

234
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,200
..you know the story
of the Kentucky fried mouse.

235
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,920
Yeah.

236
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Woman bites into a chicken leg...

237
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,320
..and it turns out to be, uh... a mouse.

238
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,680
Right?

239
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
lt's an urban myth.

240
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,960
Exactly. lt always happened
to a friend of a friend of someone else.

241
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,760
- So?
- So,...

242
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,040
..l guess there's this urban myth
goin' around here at the moment.

243
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,760
lt's about a beach.

244
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

245
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,760
And this beach is... perfect, man.

246
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
lt's on an island, right?

247
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,480
Hidden from the sea.

248
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Now, imagine. You got...

249
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,840
..pure white sand.

250
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Crystal-clear water.

251
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,960
- Palm trees.
- (Sammy) Yeah, with coconuts and shit!

252
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,320
Yo, tell him the best part, dawg.

253
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Plus...

254
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
..enough dope, Richard,...

255
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,200
..to smoke all day, every day...

256
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,440
- ..for the rest ofyour goddamn life!
- Yeah! Mad weed!

257
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,800
(Zeph) Only a few people know exactly where
it is, and they keep it absolutely secret.

258
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,800
No one's actually ever met
any ofthese people.

259
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
Exactly. lt's a Kentucky fried mouse!

260
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Hm!

261
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,120
Although, if l had a key to a place like that,...

262
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,520
..l'd keep it to myself cos... you don't want
every fuckin' asshole in Thailand...

263
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,320
..turnin' up! Boo-boo!

264
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,560
(Sammy) Yeah, yeah.

265
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
So whaddaya think
about that story, Richard?

266
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
lt's good.

267
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
lt's a good story.

268
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,800
Hey, you! l got your key!

269
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,920
Now, l know it wasn'ta part of the plan,...

270
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
..but lmade a decision
to leave a copy ofthe map.

271
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,040
l'm not gonna sayit was
the best decision l evermade.

272
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,360
l told myself that spreading news
is a part ofa traveller's nature.

273
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,760
But ifl was being completely honest,...

274
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,880
..l was just like everybody else:

275
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,000
..shit-scared of the great unknown.

276
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Desperate to take
a little piece of home with me.

277
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,840
- (Etienne) Richard?
- Are you ready?

278
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Yeah, yeah. l'm coming.

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Let's go.

Feel dead

284

287
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,080
Chut! Etienne will be angry if l wake him.

288
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,400
He thinks l waste time,
taking photographs ofthe sky.

289
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
Oh...

290
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,400
(shutter clicks)

291
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,760
- l think so, too.
- Yeah?

292
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Have a look.

293
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,920
One night, l will get the perfect photograph.

294
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,280
Hi!

295
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Whoa!

296
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
You realise that,...

297
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
..in the eternity of space,...

298
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,280
..there's probably a planet out there, right,...

299
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
..just like this one,...

300
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,520
..where another you...

301
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,200
..is photographing back down towards us.

302
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,480
l mean, essentially, you are photographing
yourself in a parallel universe.

303
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
lncredible.

304
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Yeah...

305
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,240
There are infinite worlds out there, ya know?

306
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,640
Where anything you want to happen...

307
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,360
..does happen.

308
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Richard, do you know something?

309
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,480
Hm?

310
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,360
This is just the kind of pretentious bullshit...

311
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,200
..Americans always say to French girls...
so they can sleep with them.

312
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
God! Sorry.

313
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,280
l thought l was doin' pretty good.

314
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
lt's just the sky, Richard. Let's try.

315
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Yeah.

316
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280

..quatre.

319
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,000
(Richard) When you develop
an infatuation for someone,...

320
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,440
..you always fiinda reason to believe
that this is exactly the person foryou.

321
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,680
lt doesn't need to be a good reason.

322
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,880
Taking photographs of the night sky,
for example.

323
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Now, in the long run,...

324
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,720
..that's just the kind of dumb, irritating habit
that would cause you to split up.

325
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,960
But in the haze of infatuation,...

326
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,400
..it'sjust what you've been searching for
all these years.

327
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,080
- (Etienne) One kilometre.
- (Francoise) Two.

328
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,920
- (Etienne) Richard?
- l don't know. l'm American.

329
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,080
- So?
- We think in miles, not kilometres.

330
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,560
OK. So how many miles do you think it is?

331
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
l don't know.
But it looks like a long way away.

332
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,760
lf it's too far, we're gonna drown.

333
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,600
But ifwe don't try,
we'll never know, right?

334
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,320
Right.

335
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,400
- Are you guys all right?
- (Etienne) Yeah, we're OK.

339
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
l think we're about halfway.

340
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,920
Oh, fuck! Richard!

341
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
- (Etienne) Fuck!
- What?

342
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,360
l saw a fin!

343
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,320

- (Etienne) No, no, no!

344

A fin!

OK, a shark fin?

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,240
l don't know. Just a fin.
Over there, about 100 metres.

347
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,440
- Well, was it big?
- Yes.

348
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,560
What the fuck do you expect me
to do about it?!

349
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
Nothing! l just thought you should know.

350
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
To be honest, l'd rather you hadn't told me!

351
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,240
- OK, l'm sorry.

353
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,240
Francoise! Francoise! She's gone!

354
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh, my God!

355
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,680
- Oh, my God! OK, what happened?

356
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
She was pulled under!

Oh, fuck! lt's her bag!

360
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,840
OK. Was there a shark?
Did you see a shark, Etienne?

- Who?

375
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, fuck off!

376
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,440

Argh! Agh!

399
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Sure, we should've turnedback.

400
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
But l wasn'tgoing to.

401
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Not now.

402
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,360

..it's paradise.''

405
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,440
lf we take this down,
it should lead us all the way.

406
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Come on!

407
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
(Richard) Oh, God!

408
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,560
Putain de merde!

409
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
(Etienne) Well?

411
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,080
How am l supposed to know?
Do l have to decide everything?

412
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,160
- We'll jump.
- Fuck! You wanted to be in command!

413
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,040
l only took command because
you lost your nerve, French boy!

414
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah. And look where you've taken us!

415
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680

(Etienne) All right, l will.

418
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,440
- There. We climb down there.
- We can jump.

419
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,480
Francoise! Look... We're not gonna jump!

420
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,560
All right? So just can it!
And as for climbing down there,...

421
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,880
..that is just...

422
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,640
..an asshole suggestion!

423
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,880
- Calling me an asshole?
- Yeah. And that's just the start of it.

424
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,640
- All right, fuckface, let's do it!

425
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,520

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,400
Come on, guys! lt's OK!

428
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,640
lt's not dangerous! Come on!

429
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,080
Drop the bags down! Come on!

430
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,960
All right. So we'll jump.

431
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,480

00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

437
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,480

Congratulations!

442
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,560
Took me the best part of an hour
to work up the balls to do that.

443
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,200
Mind you, l was on my own, so you have to
make allowances. Ya know what l mean?

444
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,240
l think maybe you'd better meet up with Sal.

445
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,120
Jesus Christ! We're fuckin' here!

446
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,320
Do ya realise that?

447
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Don't you go anywhere!

448
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,760
All right.

449
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
You're doin' well.

450
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,080
- Ciao! Sonja! A que si?
- Hi.

451
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
(man) Noisy kitchen!

452
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,480
How are ya doin'?

453
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,360
- What's for dinner?
- One guess. Fish.

454
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,400
l don't know what we expected.

455
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,960
People living in a cave,
maybe even a few guys in tents.

456
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,240
Gregorio!

457
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,240
But nothing like this.

458
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,280
- How are you, Keaty?
- Don't smoke 'em!

459
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,920
lt was like we arrivedinto a lost world.

460
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,760
A full-scale community of travellers - not just
passing through, but actually living here.

461
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
l suddenly became aware...

462
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,120
..that we weren't even invited.

463
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,840
- (Richard) The guy who drew it?
- Daffy.

464
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,880
Yeah... Yeah. He's dead.

465
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,080
(man) What? No way!

466
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,840
Yeah. He cut his wrists open
in a hotel room on the Khao San Road.

467
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,920
- You have seen this?!
- Well, l came afterwards.

468
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,120
Well, that's sad news.

469
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,960
He was... one of the founders
of our community.

470
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,600
Oh.

471
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
But he became depressed.

472
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,160
(woman) Crazy.

473
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,160
The police didn't know what to do with
the body, so l guess they'll incinerate him.

474
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Do you think he gave a map to anybody else?

475
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
l-l... No, l don't think so.

476
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,360
And you. Have you
shown this map to anybody?

477
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
No.

478
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
No.

479
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
No.

480
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,600
Good.

481
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,720

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,440
But it wasn't a big deal. l mean,
there wasn't any ideology or shit like that.

530
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,440
lt was just a beach resort...
for people who don't like beach resorts.

531
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
..some of us build.

532
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,080
Even paradise takes a little shaping.

533
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,160
For years, they kept this place a secret.

534
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,440
They didn't need to tell anyone.
They were practically self-sufficient.

535
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,480
They just had to sail back once in a while
to trade a little marijuana and buy some rice.

536
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,400
We grow our own, so no stealing
from the farmers on the other side.

537
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,800
And do they know that you're living here?

538
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,160
Oh, yeah. But they keep to their side
and we don't trespass on their turf.

539
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,000
A couple of years ago, they said that we
could stay, but nobody else should come.

540
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,080
- Which kind of suits us as well.
- So you was lucky, ya know.

541
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,560
Very lucky.

542
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,280
There was Keaty, who only cared
about two things.

543
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Thank you, Lord,...

544
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,200
..for the twin pillars of civilisation:

545
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,560
..Christianity...

546
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,280
..and cricket.

547
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,880
There were the Swedes:

548
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
..Christo, Sten and Karl.

549
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
We like fishing.

550
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,400
- And in the winter, we like skiing.
- Yeah!

551
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,520
Of course, in Thailand, there is no skiing.

552
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,000
(Christo) We wait, OK?

553
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,280
We wait for the fish to come.

554
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,000
Get it?

555
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,800
- Shit! No way!
- (Etienne) Whoo!

556
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,960
And l said to thee ''l shall provide!''

557
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,680
Yeah!

558
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,640
- Stop it.
- What?

559
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,080
Our resident chefwas known as Unhygenix.

560
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,680
Let's cook!

561
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,920
On account ofhis obsession with soap.

562
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Fish, fish, fish!

563
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
Still l smell offish!

564
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,360
There was a range ofsporting
and leisure activities to suitall tastes.

565
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Etienne is good at soccer.

566
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,360
Ya know, l could do that if l wanted to.

567
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,200
- l just don't want to.
- What are you talking about?

568
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,520
- Making conversation.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

569
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
- Here?
- Anywhere.

570
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,880
No. Why?

571
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,760
Just making conversation.

572
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
- (cheering)
- Whoo!

573
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,000
Right arm over wicket. Three balls remaining.
ls there anyone who still doesn't understand?

574
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,320
The only person l didn'tlike was Sal's
boyfriend, Bugs - our on-island carpenter.

575
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Hey, Richard! Can you do this?

576
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,360
Can you make anything?

577
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,520
A man should have a talent in his hands.

578
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,760
- Here we go, people!
- (whooping)

579
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,560
Surprise!

580
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,280
So every communityhas its rituals.

581
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,560
Well, ours was simple:
the last one to arrive tattoos the next.

582
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
lt fuckin' hurts, OK?

583
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,200
What did he say? (screams)

584
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,760
(laughter and cheering)

585
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,880
Agh!

586
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,400
Andy, bring yours closer.

587
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
(Etienne) Come on, Richard!

588
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,600
Ohhhh, God!

589
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,240
(cheering)

590
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,600
Ohh, God!

591
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Ohh, Jesus!

592
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,800
(Richard) That fuckin' hurt!

593
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,880
(cheering)

594
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,080
All in all, this really was paradise.

595
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
Except for one thing.

596
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Desire is desire,...

597
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,120
..wherever you go.

598
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
The sun will not bleach it,...

599
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,680
..nor the tide wash itaway.

600
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Francoise.

601
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,760
One: she's just teasin' ya.

602
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,240
(Richard) What are you talking about?

603
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,280
Two: you don't speak French.

604
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Three: he speaks French.

605
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,760
ln fact, even better than that, four:

606
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
..he is French.

607
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,840
Five: he's much better at football -
sorry, soccer - than you.

608
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,080
And six: you're a bit strange, Rich.

609
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,880
Some girls like that in a man, but not
the sort of girls you wanna be with.

610
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,400
- ls that right?
- Come on, your last girlfriend chucked ya.

611
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,600
- lt was not my fault!
- And seven: look at your thumbs, man!

612
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,360
- They're well-defined.
- What does that mean?

613
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
You play a lot of video games!

614
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,080
That is a powerful index of incompatibility.

615
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,880
Why do l get the feeling
you're trying to tell me something?

616
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,320
You haven't a hope - not a bleedin'
chicken's chance in Thailand.

617
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,720
- Know what l mean?
- Thank you.

618
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,200
So, enjoy the beach and cut the bullshit.

619
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,400
- (softly) Thank you very much.
- lt's my pleasure!

620
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,520
(Gregorio) No, you cannot... No!

621
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,960
No! No, leave me!

622
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,960
- Leave me!
- (woman) Hey! That's my bed!

623
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,920
- l can deal with it!
- l don't want you to deal with it!

624
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,880
(Bugs) lt won't take a minute.

625
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,760
Really, no! No, l must go to mainland!

626
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,440
l'm sick. l've got to. Sal!

627
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,040
What's this? You want to go
to the mainland to see a dentist?

628
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,800
- Yes.
- lt's out ofthe question.

629
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,760
(laughter)

630
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Come on!

631
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
lt'll be fun.

632
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,480
(woman) Be brave.

633
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
(Sal) How's it going, Richard?

634
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,240
Fine. Fine.

635
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,680
- Are you OK with this?
- Yeah.

636
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,120
l mean, we have a secret here, right?

637
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,720
Sometimes people need to
take a little pain to keep it that way.

638
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,280
Excellent.

639
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
Excellent attitude.

640
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,880
No problem.

641
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,720
- (Gregorio screams)
- (Bugs) Oh, shit!

642
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,640
(laughter)

643
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,680
- Good work!
- (Gregorio sobs)

644
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,520
- Kill the pain, boy.
- (Gregorio gasps)

645
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
(jeering)

646
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,760
Take a drink.

647
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
(Song ''Pure Shores'' by All Saints)

648
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,080
(laughs weakly)

649
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
(Francoise) Richard.

650
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,920
Yeah?

651
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,280
Would you like to come
to the beach with me?

652
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,560
Sure. Yeah.

653
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
Are you happy, Richard?

654
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,840
Happy?

655
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah.

656
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,080
Yeah... Yeah, l-l guess.

657
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,720
l mean, the beach, ya know, it's just perfect.

658
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Do you think that l ignore you?

659
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,560
No.

660
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,440
But l do.

661
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,240
lt's because l'm with Etienne.
lt's difficult for me to spend time with you.

662
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,360
l don't suppose that there's any...
you know, special reason that you should.

663
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,080
- Spend time with me, that is.
- Of course there is.

664
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,680
l like you.

665
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,160
A lot.

666
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,960
Have you... Have you
told this to Etienne? Or...

667
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
No.

668
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,320
lt's our secret.

669
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,480
OK.

670
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,480
Look! There! The plankton. Shrimps.

671
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,600
When they're disturbed, they glow.

672
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,680
Come on!

673
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,520
Song l'm coming, not drowning
Swimming closer to you

674
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,280
"l'm moving"

675
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,360
"l feel it"

676
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,680
"l'm coming, not drowning"

677
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
"l'm moving, l feel it"

678
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,840
"l'm coming, not drowning"

679
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,720
"l'm moving, l'm coming"

680
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
"Can you hear what l hear?"

681
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
"lt's callingyou, my dear..."

682
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,920
(Richard) Thatnight, we promised ourselves,
and we honestly believed,...

683
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
..that no one would everknow.

684
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,800
- l wanna talk.
- About what?

685
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,440
About you and Francoise.

686
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,680
Whaddaya mean... me and Francoise?

687
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
l mean, Richard,...

688
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,840
- ..that l want her to be happy.
- Yeah.

689
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
l mean, of course.

690
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,200
- We all do, right?
- Shut up!

691
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,360
Please shut the fuck up.

692
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
And if happy is with you,...

693
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,880
..then l will not stand in her way.

694
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,640
Etienne, man, l...

695
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,120
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- Fuck you, Richard! l know!

696
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,120
OK? l know!

697
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,160
Everybody knows!

698
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,840
(thunderclap)

699
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,520
(Christo) The problem is seeing the fish.

700
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,560
With the heavy rain and the bad light,...

701
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,240
..it's very difficult to catch them.

702
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,720
lt can last for days.

703
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,360
Sometimes...

704
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
..we get really hungry.

705
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,040
Gimme that.

706
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,120
Richard!

707
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,840
Richard! Richard!

708
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,600
Come out!

709
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
l can't hear you!

710
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,840
(thunder)

711
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,920
And you can't hear me.

712
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,880
- Shark!
- Come!

713
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,960
Shark!

714
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,200
Ohh!

715
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,560
- All right, all right.
- (cheering)

716
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
All right, all right, all right!

717
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,280
Shh!

718
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,720
Now before l start, there's just
a couple ofthings you have to remember.

719
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,680
Number one: you have to remain calm.

720
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,760
Right?

721
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,960
And number two: you have to show no fear.

722
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,560
- Teach it, teach it.
- Because the sharks...

723
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,480
You see, the sharks, they can sense that fear.

724
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,640
Just as easily as they can sense blood.

725
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And so it wentforme.

726
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
Just as lknewit would.

727
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,160
Just as nature had ordained.

728
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,680
lts... jaw wide open.

729
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:02,960
Row upon row ofthese razor-sharp teeth
glinting underwater like... jagged diamonds.

730
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,120
lt's tail fin sweeping back and forth
as it surged in for the kill.

731
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,760
l swear to God,...

732
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,280
..my whole life
flashed before my eyes.

733
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,560
Really.

734
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,400
l had nothing left to offer
except for pure reflex.

735
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,000
Pure reflex...

736
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,000
..and mankind's basic drive forsurvival
that somehow...

737
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,960
..shouts ''No! l will not die today!''

738
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,560
- Yes!
- Whoo!

739
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,320
At that instant, lknew
it was either the shark orme.

740
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,560
The shark knewit.

741
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,640
l knewit.

742
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,760
But jeez... God!

743
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,240
It's nothin' personal, right? It's just
the way the world works. lt's nature.

744
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,120
But... if I remember correctly,...

745
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,040
..in that last glimmer of its eyes,...

746
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,560
..there was a moment between us...

747
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,720
..where it said ''Hey, Richard, man.''

748
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,360
''Enjoy your dinner.''

749
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,440
(whooping andlaughter)

750
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,000
(cheering)

751
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,040
Strange thing, killing a shark,
isn't it, Richard?

752
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,760
lt's just a big fish, Bugs.

753
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,760
Just a big fish?

754
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,480
Yeah, maybe! Maybe when it's just a baby
and it hasn't really learned to kill yet.

755
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
Then maybe it's just a big fish.

756
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,480
But when it's a great white angry mother
with the taste of blood on its tongue,...

757
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,640
..now that's a different story.

758
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,680
Oh, God! Jeez... (chuckles)

759
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,760
l'm sorry, Bugs. ls itjust me?

760
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,560
Or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired?

761
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,720
Maybe we can hear your very different
and, l'm sure, very interesting story...

762
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,600
- ..some other time, huh?
- ...

763
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,400
Very interesting, Keaty!

764
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,280
Vrlo interesantno.

765
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,560
Molto interessante!

766
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,960
- Good night, young lovers.
- (chuckles) Shut up!

767
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,720
For a while, we were untouchable
in our happiness.

768
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
All right! Everybody!

769
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,400
- (chatter continues)
- Quiet!

770
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,000
We have a situation. lt's not a disaster.
But as some of you may have heard,...

771
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,120
..a couple of sacks of rice have
become contaminated by a fungus.

772
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,440
- Yeah.
- lt's cos we keep it in that shack.

773
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,120
- How many more times must this happen?
- Rice run!

774
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,000
Which means that...

775
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,200
..someone will have to come
to Ko Pha-Ngan to buy more rice.

776
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,160
So don't all volunteer at once(!)

777
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,040
Richard.

778
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,200
Yeah?

779
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,640
Are you gonna come
to Ko Pha-Ngan with me?

780
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,680
- l don't know. l mean...
- l'll go with you.

781
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,040
Don't worry, Bugs. Richard's gonna come.

782
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,840
Am l?

783
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,200
- Who thinks Richard should come?
- Absolutely.

784
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,880
All right. Then l'll go
to Ko Pha-Ngan with you.

785
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,320
(murmurs and cheers ofapproval)

786
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,440
So, Richard,...

787
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,880
..l want toothpaste and...
and a toothbrush, yeah?

788
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Right.

789
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,120
Uh... a new pair of swim trunks
and a new hat.

790
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,240

00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,280

792

Make it 40 condoms.

793
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,480
And a bottle of vodka.

794
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,960
- (woman) Six bars of chocolate.
- Uh... Fuck!

795
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,400
Four boxes of tampons. Assorted sizes.

796
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,120
Smell it. lt's a part of me.

797
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,440
I am becoming a fish, Richard.

798
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,720
Ordinary soap for ordinary people
is a waste of time.

799
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,000
l need something toxic,
something industrial. OK?

800
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,000
OK.

801
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,160
A tin of beef curry. Yummy.

802
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,760
- Yummy.

..The Daily Telegraph.

805
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,560
lt's just for the cricket, ya know.

806
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,640
Oh.

807
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,680
- Please, fill this bag with a soft bog roll.
- Soft bog roll?

808
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,200

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,720
Oh-hoh! Ow! Oh... OK...

816
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,240
When you get to Ko Pha-Ngan,
keep your hands to yourself...

817
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,600
- ..and your dick in your pants.
- (groans)

818
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,680
Agh... (gasps)

819
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,960
Oh! Shit!

820
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,640
(softly) Oh, shit!

821
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,480
l'd been looking forward
to air conditioning and coldbeer,...

822

..but when we got to Ko Pha-Ngan,...

823
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,600
..ljust wanted to leave again.

824
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,600
ln one moment, l understood more clearly
than ever why we were so special,...

825
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,800
..why we kept oursecret.

826
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,600
Because ifwe didn't,...

827
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,200
..sooner or later, they'd turn it into this.

828
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,920
Cancers.

829
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,160
Parasites.

830
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,760
Eating up the whole fuckin' world.

831
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,760

Maybe... maybe a year, even.

834
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,440
Yeah, really.

835
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,160
What?

836
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,440

Things are different.

837
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,520

838
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,760

What are you talking about, man?

860
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,080
No, listen to me. There's no beach.

- l can't believe we're seeing you, dude!
- No beach?

862
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,640
Yeah. No, seriously, the map thing?
lt was fake.

863
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,520
- lt was like you said: it was a story.
- (Zeph) Right(!)

864
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,480
No! lt's... it's a myth. Really. lt doesn't exist.

865
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,040
- C'mon...
- The map was a fake. Understand?

866
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,640
You wouldn't be

(Sal) And they saw the map?

874
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,360
- Mm-hm.
- Do they have a copy?

875
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,080
No.

876
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,280
OK.

877
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,360
Well, we can relax for a bit.

878
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,000
l doubt they have it in them
to get there anyway. But, Richard,...

879
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,280
..l don't think we should tell anybody.

880
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,480
OK? l think we should
keep it between you and l.

881
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,080
Thanks.

882
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Don't mention it.

883
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,000
Phew!

884
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,800
- (thumping dance music)
- (yells)

885
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,880
Well, l'm going to go and play...

886
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,360
..a couple of games of pool with Sumet.

887
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,600
Sumet!

888
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,680
Snook?

889
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,080
So why don't you go...

890
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,680
..and warm the bed?

891
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
(speaks Thai)

892
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,400
(panting)

893
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,200
(Richard) Come on! Mm!

894
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,280
(Sal moans)

895
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,760
Sal?

896
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,520
- Sal?
- Mm-hm?

897
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,640
l just have a question.

898
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
lt was very nice.

899
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,840
No. That's not it.

900
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,240
lt's about Bugs.

901
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,440
OK...

902
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,440
lt's like this.

903
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,520
Bugs is my boyfriend.

904
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,040
My partner.

905
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,320
OK?

906
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,400
And you... are someone l just had sex with.

907
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,840
- All right?
- That... that's fine.

908
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,880
- That's absolutely fine.
- Good.

909
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,360
Now get some sleep. l may wish to
have sex again before we eat breakfast.

910
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
lt was a deal.

911
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,000
She wouldn't tell anyone about the map.

912
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,680
l had paid for her silence
and bought my ticket back.

913
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,760
But l didn't even wanna think
about the real price.

914
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,040
(Keaty) All right, Rich, we're ready!

915
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,120
OK.

916
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,320
- Got it, Keaty?
- Yeah! No probs!

917
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,520
- (woman) Richard!
- (Richard) Problem solved. Here's the bleach.

918
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,360
We got the make-up remover.
l have two of 'em.

919
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,680
(woman) Oh...

920
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,600
- Extra! Extra!
- Oh, Richard, man, l love you!

921
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,280
(woman) Man, this is gonna last me...

922
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,360
Oh, great! You're lovely.

923
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,520
- Did you get batteries?
- Right here.

924
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Yes!

925
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,400
- (man) Song l can see my baby! Whoo-hoo!
- Sten, that's all for you. Christo...

926
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,800
Hey, Ricardo!

927
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,880
- Grazie!
- One tin of beef curry?

928
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,800
One... disposable camera.

929
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,800
lt's not as good as the one you left behind,
but... what the hell, right?

930
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,040
No, it doesn't matter. l like it.

931
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,120
What's wrong?

932
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,600
- How was it?
- The rice run? Fine.

933
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,200
No problem.

934
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,280
l mean, being with Sal.

935
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,000
Fine. l mean... we got along OK.

936
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,640
Some people say she's attracted to you.

937
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,920
Shit! l... l really wouldn't have noticed that.

938
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,560
- Nothing happened?
- No! Of course not!

939
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
You promise?

940
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,720
l was so happy to be back...

941
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,480
..that l couldn'tbear to spoil the moment.

942
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,560
Yes.

943
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,640
Yes, l promise.

944
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,120
l missed you.

945
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,560
OK, come on, everybody! Come on, please!

946
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,400
Come on... please.

947
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,040
All together. Close together.

948
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,120
Please!

949
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,440
OK, close together.

950
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,640
OK. Stand back a little bit.

951
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,720
OK...

952
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,200
So, one... two... three!

953
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,760
(cheer)

954
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,560
(Richard) So I started just where I left off.

955
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,880
lt was almost like my trip
to Ko Pha-Ngan never happened.

956
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Almost.

957
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,360
(Song)

958
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,800
- Agh!
- You'll be all right!

959
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,560
Argh!

960
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,280
Tsk!

961
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,360
(scream)

962
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,320
(scream echoes)

963
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,320
(woman screams hysterically)

964
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,440
(man) Shark!

965
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,000
Shark!

966
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,080
Shaaark!

967
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,600
- He's dead.
- Shut up! He's fuckin' not dead!

968
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,680
(sobs)

969
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,760
(gasps in pain)

970
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,560
My... my...

971
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,640
My leg!

972
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,360
My leg!

973
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,000
(gasps in pain)

974
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,520
(Christo yells in pain)

975
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,960
We can take you to a hospital,
all right? We can do that.

976
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:09,960
But when you're there, you mustn't
tell anybody where this happened.

977
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,040
We have to keep our secret.

978
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,960
- Lakaren maste komma hit!
- What's he saying?

979
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,280
He says that we are to
bring help here for him.

980
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,360
He won't go near the water.

981
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,440
l understand that, but we can't
bring anybody here. We can't do that.

982
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,800
- Bring help! You've gotta bring help!
- We can't, Christo!

983
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,160
You have to go. Or you stay here
and take your chances.

984
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,200
- Anyone disagree?
- Karl... varharhantmed Sten?

985
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,520
(Etienne) What is he saying?

986
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,360
He wants to know
what happened to his friend.

987
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:53,440
(Keaty) We are gathered here today
to say a last respect to Sten.

988
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,840
May God take your soul.

989
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,000
- And you will rest forever in peace, mate.
- (man snivels)

990
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,080
We'll miss ya.

991
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,920
Jag alskar digfrom Christo and me.

992
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,000
Riposati in pace...

993
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,000
..from Lorenzo.

994
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,440
(Guitar plays ''Redemption Song'')

995
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,680
(woman sobs)

996
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,160
"Old pirates, yes, they rob I"

997
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,560
"Sold l to the merchant ships"

998
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,200
"Minutes after they took l"

999
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,960
"From the bottomless pit"

1000
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,920
"And my hand was made strong"

1001
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,960
"By the hand of the Almighty"

1002
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:04,480
"We forward in this generation"

1003
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,480
"Triumphantly"

1004
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,520
"Won't you help to sing"

1005
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,800
(all) "These songs of freedom?"

1006
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,240
"Cos all l ever had"

1007
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,360
"Redemption song"

1008
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,800
"Redemption song"

1009
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,960
(whimpers in pain)

1010
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
Argh! (sobs)

1011
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,480
After the funeral,
we all tried to getback to normal.

1012
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,440
- (Christo cries out)
- Butitjust didn'tseem right.

1013
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,000
''..no steadyjob.''

1014
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,080
- ltbecame clear the problem was Christo.
- (Christo cries out)

1015
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,280
Shut up!

1016
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,000
You see, in a shark attack,
or any othermajor tragedy, lguess,...

1017
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,360
..the important thing is to get eaten and die,...

1018
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,880
..in which case there's a funeral
and somebody makes a speech...

1019
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,560
..and everybody says
what a good guy you were.

1020
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,640
Or get better,...

1021
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,120
..in which case everyone can forget about it.

1022
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,600
- (man) l can't take this.
- (woman) Christo, please!

1023
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:23,000
- (Christo cries out)
- ''..every two or three autumns.''

1024
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,400
(woman) Great atmosphere(!)

1025
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,440
- Getbetter or die.
- (Christo moans)

1026
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,040
lt's the hanging around in between
that really pisses people off.

1027
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,120
Listen to me. You can't do this.

1028
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,200
This is disgusting!

1029
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,200
Take him back!

1030
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,440
- OK, just here.
- Fucking animals!

1031
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,240
What are you doing this for? Huh?

1032
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,400
Tell me!

1033
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,600
How can you do this?

1034
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,600
Richard!

1035
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,800
Fucking bastards!

1036
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,400
Bastards!

1037
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,400
lt wouldbe a lot easier to condemn
our behaviour if it hadn't been so effective.

1038
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,440
But out of sight...

1039
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,520
..really was out of mind.

1040
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,600
Once he was gone,...

1041
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,680
..we felt a whole lot better.

1042
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,080
On the beach, it's easy to turn yourback,...

1043
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,560
..but not always so easy to forget.

1044
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,920
Pay them in dollars, fuck their daughters,
and turn it into Wonderland, Richard!

1045
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,320
(whispers) Richard. Come with me.

1046
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,400
(Sal) ls that, or is that not,...

1047
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,560
..a map she's holding?

1048
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,720
And did you,...

1049
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,800
..or did you not,...

1050
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,320
..make that copy?

1051
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,120
You know, the lying doesn't bother me.

1052
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,720
But that map...

1053
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,240
..is trouble!

1054
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,920
The farmers, right? You remember,
those men with guns?

1055
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
They said to us, they told us...

1056
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,880
..''No more people.''

1057
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,680
And now it looks like we're
handing out fucking tour guides!

1058
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,600
Sal. l mean...

1059
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,040
We could explain, right?
l mean, we could tell 'em it was Daffy.

1060
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,920
We could explain?!

1061
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,880
l want you up here every day
until those people come.

1062
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,320
- Here?
- Yes, here.

1063
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,360
l want you to get the map back.

1064
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,960
OK? Whatever happens,
you get the map back.

1065
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,360
W-Wait! Sal!

1066
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,240
- Sal, they could be there for weeks!
- That's right.

1067
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,480
- And you'll be here, waiting for them.
- What am l supposed to do when they come?

1068
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,120
Get the map!!

1069
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:41,440
You drew it! You handed it out!
Now you get it back and turn them away!

1070
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,000
Sal! Sal!

1071
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,400
Are you gonna tell'em what else l did?

1072
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,640
Now this was truly a pain in the ass.

1073
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,200
I didn't want these people
to come here anymore than Sal did.

1074
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,720
But what exactly did she expect me to do?

1075
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,800
Chase them away? Threaten them?
l mean, with what?

1076
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,840
By the time these kids gothere,
l'd probably have starved to death.

1077
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,120
(movement)

1078
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,160
Sal?

1079
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,360
- Sal, is that you? Get that light outta...
- You're a pig!

1080
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,560
Dammit! What the fuck was that for?
There's nothing l can do!

1081
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,440
- l have to stay up here!
- Not that, OK?

1082
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,120
- What is it, then?
- You and Sal in Ko Pha-Ngan.

1083
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,040
Oh, that.

1084
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,760
Yeah, that! She has told everyone!

1085
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,840
And me, l'm the last one to find out!

1086
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,560
At least she believes in honesty. Not like you.

1087
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,240
l mean, Francoise, l...

1088
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,360
What... what can l say?

1089
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,680
Nothing. There's nothing you can say.

1090
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,720
Thank you(!)

1091
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,560
Thank you for making my life just perfect(!)

1092
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,960
Super(!)

1093
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,480
God...

1094
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,560
..dammit!

1095
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,040
Shit!

1096
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,400
You are such an idiot!

1097
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,400
Even though l knew it would happen...
l was crushed.

1098
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,280
And l guess l deserved it.

1099
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,360
l coulda given her
all the excuses she wanted,...

1100
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,800
..but it wouldn'thave made any difference.

1101
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,520
Great(!) Great(!)

1102
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,920
At fiirst, l thoughtl was gonna die up here,...

1103
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,320
..that my entire world was gonna end.

1104
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,720
But it didn't.

1105
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,080
In fact... pretty soon, I found that there were
plenty of other things to keep me occupied.

1106
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,960
And before I knew it,...

1107
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,640
..I found that love, like grief,...

1108
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,280
..tends to fade away...

1109
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,280
..and be replaced by something more exciting.

1110
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,840
And life up on the hill turned out
to be a big improvement.

1111
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,320
I mean, up here, I could do what ever I wanted.

1112
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:34,000
There was no fishing duty, no gardening shit,
no hassle from Bugs or Etienne or Francoise.

1113
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,080
l was playing my own game now.

1114
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,400
And I had absolutely no reason to go back.

1115
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,040
(Song "On Your Own: Crouch
End Broadway Mix" by Blur)

1116
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,880
OK, so l was just foolin'around.

1117
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,400
But the longer I stayed away from
the community,... the less I missed them.

1118
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,240
And I found new players.

1119
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,760
Even if they didn't know it yet.

1120
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,720
This forest was my territory.

1121
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,600
Retrieving the map,... my mission.

1122
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
And these,...

1123
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,680
..my defenders.

1124
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,720
I was the only one with the overview...

1125
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,680
..of how it all fitted together.

1126
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,120
The island.

1127
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,040
Me.

1128
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,400
Them.

1129
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,120
The invaders.

1130
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,920
All connected.

1131
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,720
All playing the same game.

1132
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,800
(birds chatter)

1133
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,880
And at the centre of it all,...

1134
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,440
..one man:

1135
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,880
..Daffy.

1136
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,760
(helicopter)

1137
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,480
lnside!

1138
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,680
Take a look, Richard!

1139
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,480
Viruses, Richard!

1140
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,880
Cancers!

1141
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,920
The big, chunky Charlie's
eating up the whole world! Out there!

1142
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,560
Down on the beach! Down on
the street! Pay them in dollars...

1143
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,760
..and fuck their daughters!

1144
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,400
lt starts with four!

1145
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,000
Four! But they multiply! They multiply!

1146
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,440
lt's time to stop them!

1147
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,800
Year zero, kiddo!

1148
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,360
Year zero!

1149
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,800
Are you with me or against me?

1150
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
l'm with ya all the way, Daffy!

1151
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,320
Ye-ea-ah! Yeah! Yeah!

1152
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,040
(door opens)

1153
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,040
Richard?

1154
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,400
Yeah...

1155
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,480
Where you been, man?!

1156
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,640
What are you doing, sitting in the dark?

1157
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,480
Improving my night vision.

1158
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,560
What for, mate?

1159
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,680
You know who l think about a lot?

1160
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,440
l have no idea.

1161
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,840
Daffy.

1162
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,520
Daffy?

1163
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,000
Uh-huh.

1164
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,840
l admire him.

1165
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,240
You hardly knew him.

1166
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,960
True...

1167
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,600
But he had a certain style.

1168
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,560
- Come here!
- (grunts)

1169
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,560
Fucking come here!

1170
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,840
Yes! They're talking about you.

1171
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:17,920
- (Bugs) You're moaning, that's all.
- (Gregorio) l'm not moaning.

1172
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
- l need to find out what his problem is.
- (Bugs) Do you think l like the guy?

1173
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,960
- (woman) What does he do all day?
- (Gregorio) He does no work in garden.

1174
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,520
But he steals our food. l'm sure of it.

1175
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,400
You hear what they're saying?

1176
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,280
ldle, sponging, useless prick!

1177
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,720
(Keaty) Now, get your fucking act together.

1178
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,800
You can't run around in the dark
not talking to nobody.

1179
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:43,360
What do you think you're playing at, man?
What's happened to you?

1180
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,520
You was all right.
Just a couple of weeks ago, you was fine.

1181
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,440
And now, what the fuck is going on?

1182
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,520
Look at you!

1183
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,600
And you're talking about Daffy?!

1184
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,400
Daffy was a nutter, right?
He went out there and he lost it. He's gone!

1185
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,480
Richard!

1186
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Richard!

1187
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,120
Do you hear what l'm saying to you?

1188
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,680
Don't lose it like him. Do ya understand?

1189
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,360
Don't go there! Stay with us.
Come back, Rich!

1190
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,800
These are good people.
They don't talk about people all the time.

1191
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,080
They're talking about you
because you're fucked up!

1192
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,760
(echoing whispers)

1193
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,640
..too much sensation.

1194
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,360
..got outta control.

1195
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:44,040
(Sal's voice echoes) And now it looks like
we're handing out fucking tourguides!

1196
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,920
Mushroom, Richard?

1197
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,920
No, thank you, Daffy.

1198
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,600
l don't need any help
to see the writing on the wall.

1199
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,120
- l'm very glad to hear that, Richard.
- Gotta keep my head clear.

1200
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,680
- Getting closer, any day now.
- Year zero?

1201
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,760
That's the spirit, kiddo.

1202
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,800
You know somethin'?

1203
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,360
You led the way, Daffy.

1204
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,720
You showed me the truth.

1205
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,360
But it doesn't matter what lthink
any more. lt's up to you now.

1206
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,200
l won't let you down.

1207
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,000
Hey, Richard.

1208
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,080
No offence but, erm...

1209
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,240
..you're fucked in the head, man.

1210
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,880
(helicopter)

1211
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,800
lt's been really nice knowing you, Daffy.

1212
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,800
(echoing whispers)

1213
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:08,480
(Richard) We're on patrol in the Delta.
Search and destroy.

1214
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,040
(echoing whispers)

1215
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,120
We're notmaking any contact.

1216
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,520
(echoing whispers continue)

1217
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:24,760
- This lieutenant, he says to me...
- (lieutenant) Get out there and draw their fiire!

1218
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:29,960
- (Richard) lt's never gonna happen, sir.
- (lieutenant) Are you refusing an order, son?

1219
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:34,840
- (Richard) It looks that way, sir.
- (lieutenant) "It looks that way, sir"?!

1220
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,440
(echoing giggles)

1221
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,280
(Richard) Then my M-16 just went off, man.

1222
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,680

01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,400
(screaming)

1394
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,600
(woman whimpers)

1395
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,680
(relieved snort)

1396
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,920
(laughs)

1397
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
(Richard giggles hysterically)

1398
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,200
No! No...

1399
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,200
No! No!

1400
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,280
(panicked shouting)

1401
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,440
C'mon, hold on to me.

1402
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,680
(sobs)

1403
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,080
(farmers shout commands in Thai)

1404
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,320
Game over.

1405
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,840
But she was never gonna leave.

1406
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,080
She believed in it all
way too much to ever change.

1407
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,160
So that's exactly where we lefther.

1408
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,680
"We sailed to the seven seas"

1409
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:00,480
"Searching for the missing key"

1410
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,160
"Unlocking you"

1411
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,800
"The world's harmony"

1412
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:14,680
"We climbed the highest mountain range"

1413
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,440
"Then we took the longest day..."

1414
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,520
And as for the rest of us,...

1415
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:25,840
..we carried away our sins and made our way
back to wherever it was we called home,...

1416
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,920
..to pick up the pieces
of whatever was waiting.

1417
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:40,880
Of course, you can never forget
what you've done.

1418
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,960
But we adapt.

1419
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,000
We carry on.

1420
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,960
"The heat and rhythm in the rivers run"

1421
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,680
"And blinding faith in the desert sun"

1422
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,040
"Hear them today"

1423
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:04,240
"Play all as one"

1424
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:11,480
"Distant voices sang the far-off sky"

1425
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,800
"Led us to that elusive prize"

1426
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:26,600
- Can l get you anything?
- No, thanks.

1427
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,960
And me?

1428
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,600
I still believe in paradise.

1429
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,600
But now, atleast I know
it's not some place you can look for.

1430
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,960
Because it's not where you go,...

1431
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:44,360
..it's how you feel for a moment in your life
when you're a part of something.

1432
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,680
And if you find that moment,...

1433
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,760
..it lasts for ever.

1434
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,280
(Song "Lonely Soul" by UNKLE
featuring Richard Ashcroft)

1435
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:00,400

"Yeah, yeah"

1439
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:31,160
"I believe there's a time and a place"

1440
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:36,840
"To let your minds reflect
Get out of this place"

1441
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:41,560
"I believe there's a day and a place"

1442
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:46,840
"That we will go to
and I know you wanna share"

1443
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:52,920
"There's no secret to living
There's no secret to living"

1444
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,960
"Justkeep on walking"

1445
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:03,000
"There's no secret to dying
There's no secret to dying"

1446

"Just keep on flying"

1447
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:16,600
"l'm gonna die in a place
that don't know my name"

1448
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:25,840
"l'm gonna die in a space
that don't hold my name"

1449
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:34,760
"Oooh-ooh"

1450
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:36,680
"Walking in the cold"

1451
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:44,040
