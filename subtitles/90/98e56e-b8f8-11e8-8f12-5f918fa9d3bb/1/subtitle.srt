1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,671
Look over there!

2
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,913
Is this all?

3
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,475
It's what the boss gave me.

4
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,870
It should be more.

5
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,918
Let's go, it's late!

6
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,877
Osvaldo, let's go hunting?

7
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,228
Sure.

8
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,197
He dreamed.

9
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,270
Yes, he dreamed again.

10
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,869
Never leave him on his own,

11
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,350
be watchful.

12
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,788
Let's go.

13
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,477
Bring us something to eat.
Okay!

14
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,358
Going hunting again?
We'll have success today!

15
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,356
You're incapable!

16
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,473
Indians!

17
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,397
Get out of here!

18
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,230
Sooner or later |'|| shoot you!

19
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,590
Look, a macaw!

20
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,238
Don't miss him.

21
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,276
He ran off.

22
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,476
I'll go tell the others.

23
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,713
Now you'll go
where you can feel good.

24
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,877
Let's go back.

25
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,636
Put her in face-down.

26
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,630
Angué is here, I feel him.

27
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,193
| return your things to you.

28
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,678
Your bracelet,
telephone, clothes, shoes.

29
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,631
I don't want your things around,
that's the end of it.

30
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,750
You wouldn't listen to me.

31
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,032
You were always stubborn,
but now you're alone.

32
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,633
I don't want your things anymore.

33
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,153
Now get out of here,
you'll be left alone.

34
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,996
I don't want to live here anymore.

35
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,914
Get moving, burn everything!

36
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,590
Hurry!

37
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,873
NATIVE RESERVE
PROTECTED AREA

38
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,235
Osvaldo dreamed about Elma,
he knew she'd hang herself.

39
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,832
Who's Osvaldo?

40
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,519
Lia's son.

41
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,554
Then I have to teach him
to be a shaman.

42
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,472
We can't keep living on the Reserve.

43
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,714
We must return to our land,
to our tekohé.

44
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,436
Or else we'll all die.

45
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,278
FORBIDDEN TO SELL ALCOHOL
TO NATIVES

46
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,756
Another two cases of suicide
on the Dourados Native Reserve.

47
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,270
The bodies of two adolescent
natives were found in the forest.

48
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,552
Steves, turn that shit down!

49
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,429
I'm no Indian!

50
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,676
Chew your change.

51
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,311
Nadio, how's it goin'?

52
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,033
Hello, Dimas.

53
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,233
Hello.

54
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,997
What do you need today?

55
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,998
I brought a list.

56
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,474
I'm not extending credit
to you anymore,

57
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,156
you already owe me,
you're fooling with me.

58
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,992
You don't have all that money.

59
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,670
I'll leave you
the horse and carriage.

60
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,239
What are they worth?
Two thousand.

61
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,035
Two thousand? They're worth
one thousand at most.

62
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,996
That's not even a horse.

63
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,071
One thousand, okay?

64
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,797
Let's make it one thousand.

65
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,678
And I'll offer you a drink.

66
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,592
Dimas,

67
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,951
I need a ride.

68
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,670
A ride to where?

69
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,999
Steves!

70
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,317
Two sacks of flour, three of rice...

71
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,670
Oil, yerba mate...

72
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,836
Let's go,
I'm not waiting any more.

73
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,310
Let's stop here.

74
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,713
Here?
Yes.

75
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,671
But this is Moreira's land.

76
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,271
This is Moreira's land,
come on, I'll take you back.

77
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,232
We're staying here.

78
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,350
I'll take you back.

79
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,757
It's here.

80
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,870
This is our tekohé,

81
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,547
our ancestors are buried here.

82
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,356
We're staying here.

83
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,033
We'll starve here.

84
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,038
No one will starve, we'll hunt,
you'll have to learn.

85
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,956
I'm not going in the forest,
Angué is there.

86
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,757
It used to be all forest here.

87
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,157
All forest.

88
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,747
What are those people doing there?

89
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,472
I don't know.

90
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,638
Give them an inch
and they take a whole yard.

91
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,036
It starts like this and then
becomes a never-ending problem.

92
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,998
Tie it.

93
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:09,390
Someone‘s coming.

94
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,310
How are you doing?
Fine.

95
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,511
Who's Nadio?
I am.

96
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,550
You?

97
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,478
My name's Tito.

98
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,989
I'm very tired.
So?

99
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,031
I heard you were setting up camp,
I've come to stay.

100
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,196
To stay?
Yeah.

101
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,159
Think we'll be here long?
I don't know.

102
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,435
The sun's setting.

103
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,270
It'll be dark soon.

104
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,630
That's him.

105
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,678
Is it true
you dream what happens later?

106
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,394
Yes.

107
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,194
Then you can be a shaman like me,

108
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,354
but you have to start now
on the right path.

109
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,552
You have to learn
to recognize the good voices

110
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,911
and defend yourself
from Angué, the evil spirit.

111
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,869
You must take the maraca now,

112
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,957
always caress and play it,

113
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,151
it'll defend you.

114
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,277
Give me the maraca.

115
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,231
This is your maraca.

116
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,830
You have to sing and pray.

117
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,713
You have to play it all the time.

118
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,590
Louder!

119
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,155
Nadio, he's dreaming again.

120
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,231
Wake him up.

121
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,918
Osvaldo...

122
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,795
Go get some water.

123
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,035
Go away!

124
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,233
Neo!

125
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,711
It's full of shit here.

126
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:19,393
I clean,
but the birds keep shitting.

127
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:22,113
If they keep shitting,
you keep cleaning.

128
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,319
Have you got any left?
Yes.

129
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,590
The lighter too?
I have everything.

130
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,357
Let's go.

131
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,551
What are you doing here?

132
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,716
What are you doing here yourself?

133
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,957
What's that?
This?

134
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,839
It's a cell phone
to talk with Nhanderu.

135
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,476
A cell phone...

136
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:44,473
Go talk to your god somewhere else,
we want to swim.

137
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,314
Did you come to the river to pray

138
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,352
or to screw that little girl
with the crooked legs?

139
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,558
Let's go.

140
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,758
Let's go!

141
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:03,390
Look at that.

142
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,834
They're already bringing water in.

143
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,715
We can't let that happen.

144
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,950
You have to be a scarecrow,
you gotta scare them.

145
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,790
My bag!

146
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,632
You bastard!
You'll starve here.

147
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,437
They're coming!

148
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,550
Here they are, it's them!

149
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,268
Sit down here.

150
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:04,677
Look at this bottle, you must
be as transparent as this.

151
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,235
As you prepare to become a shaman,

152
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,113
you mustn't touch any woman.

153
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,389
|'|| teach you secret prayers,

154
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,274
very powerful prayers that can kill.

155
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,155
Tuiuiu.

156
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:40,834
Blue Arara.

157
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,148
Gaviéo de penacho.

158
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:13,235
Did you tell them
the Indians here eat people?

159
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,074
They cut them in little pieces
and roast them on the fire.

160
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,195
Maria, must I call your father?

161
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,593
Can't we have
a moment's peace here?

162
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:31,077
What's going on?

163
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,511
Cut this foolishness.

164
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:36,358
Get out.

165
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,833
Lia!

166
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:56,996
Talk to the white man,
he has something in his belt.

167
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,038
Let him come,
he won't hurt us,

168
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,950
it's just a gun,

169
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,551
don't be afraid.

170
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,553
Hi.

171
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,191
What are you doing here?

172
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,879
I don't have any water.

173
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,312
Go to the river.

174
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,510
I can't leave my post.

175
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,836
I'm not giving you any.

176
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,438
Come here.

177
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,036
What do you do with that gun?
Jerk-offs?

178
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:21,712
Do you shoot jerk-offs
with your gun?

179
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,511
You jerk-off!

180
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,992
Nadio!

181
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,560
Tito, where's Nadio?

182
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,954
Are things okay?
Things are okay.

183
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:17,753
There's work at Fazenda Santa Rita,
I'll take you there free.

184
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:20,588
How many days?
Ten.

185
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,348
Too many.

186
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,195
Just ten days, come on.

187
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,555
No one's going,
the women can't be left alone.

188
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,915
I'll go.

189
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,354
Go, take your things

190
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,278
and don't come back.

191
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,193
Let's go, Tito.

192
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,394
Mami!

193
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,152
There's a woman in Dourados
looking for a housemaid, how about it?

194
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,318
Have it your way.

195
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,393
But stop coming to me
asking for credit

196
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,160
and telling me
you've no money for food!

197
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,156
Want work?

198
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,308
Don't show up at the store!

199
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,156
Help me!

200
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,355
Grab hold!

201
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,995
Where did this meat come from?
It's payment for work.

202
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,590
Show me the brand.

203
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:11,517
Show it to me!

204
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:24,755
What are you doing here?

205
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,548
You can't camp out here.

206
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,354
Your place is in the Reserve!

207
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,956
Why don't you go back
to the Reserve? That's your place.

208
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,275
What are you doing here?

209
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,873
You'll just cause problems,
why are you here?

210
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,958
Give it to her.

211
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,433
Here, Lia.

212
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,998
You're learning,
you can't eat that meat!

213
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,316
You mustn't eat it!

214
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:51,951
It can hurt you,
you must sing, you must pray.

215
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,195
What do | eat then?

216
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:57,152
Go hunting!
Kill other animals.

217
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,070
There's nothing left to hunt.

218
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,637
The jaguar attacks us,
but he's our brother.

219
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:10,275
The cobra attacks us,
but he too is our brother.

220
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,035
The cow occupies our land,
he's our enemy.

221
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,028
You mustn't eat it!

222
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,836
I don't know, you find a way.

223
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,755
I'm not a lawyer, you are.

224
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,478
They're camping right outside
my property and I can't do anything?

225
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,310
I'll wait for news.

226
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:47,356
Continue, it's very nice.

227
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,677
No.
Why not?

228
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:52,875
You can't watch.

229
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,351
Now you can continue.

230
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,229
You killed the cow, didn't you?

231
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,273
Don't worry,
my father has lots of them.

232
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,990
What's your name?
Maria.

233
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:47,238
Where are you going?

234
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,636
To the man with the long nose.
His dick is long, not his nose!

235
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:52,477
The man with the long dick!

236
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,911
Would you like some water?

237
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,794
Do you have any cookies
for the children?

238
00:44:20,439 --> 00:44:22,191
Yes, I do.

239
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:38,719
Want a piece?
Yes.

240
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:11,310
Do you eat people?

241
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,999
Don't you ever wash?
You stink of cheese!

242
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,671
Lovely Indian!

243
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:13,435
Put it there in the earth.

244
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,111
Get out of here!

245
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,991
You can't stay here.

246
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,316
Leave.
Out!

247
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,870
Come on, out.

248
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,509
Be careful, stay away from that.

249
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:17,830
You'll get sick.

250
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,832
There are no marks
of either jaguar or cobra.

251
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,668
But it can't be hoof-and-mouth.

252
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,992
So what is it?

253
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:03,230
The curse of the Indians.

254
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:08,227
I saw arrows stuck in the ground.

255
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,550
It's the shaman.

256
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:08,637
Look at him.

257
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:10,594
I told him to wash,
his dick is full of lice.

258
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,638
What are you doing here?

259
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,159
We're getting water.

260
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:18,190
Go away!

261
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:21,590
Here comes butt beautiful!

262
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,873
He's coming to you!
No, to you!

263
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:30,237
Careful, he's always straight up.

264
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,997
Everything straight up
comes down sooner or later.

265
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:37,272
He'll get here with his dick out.

266
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,070
You have to get out of here now!

267
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:46,076
Listen to him, the grouch.

268
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,237
You're always asking for water,
now help me carry it.

269
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:55,069
Now sing for us.
I'm not going to sing.

270
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,589
Come on, sing!
No!

271
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,518
If you leave, |'|| sing.

272
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,951
You scared the animal off.

273
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:25,911
What was it?

274
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,831
It was my lunch.

275
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:32,151
What was it?

276
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,919
A macaw.

277
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,990
What do you pray at the river?

278
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:40,877
I pray...

279
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,954
I pray to Nhanderu

280
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:46,434
to be able to see people's future.

281
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,713
If I pray a lot,
I can also break your scooter.

282
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,478
Why break my scooter?

283
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,557
If I want to, I can.

284
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,511
Is it hard to ride a scooter?

285
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,158
Will you teach me?

286
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:11,152
Get on.

287
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:20,510
Behave yourself!

288
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,120
This is how you accelerate,

289
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:33,870
push this and change gear
and then let up slowly, understand?

290
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,191
Want to try?
Okay.

291
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,958
Slowly.

292
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,153
Neo!

293
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,518
Listen to me,
take them this money

294
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:31,031
and tell them there's work
with tourists next week.

295
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,351
But on one condition,
that they go back to the Reserve.

296
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:37,435
It won't do, even for transport.

297
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,869
How much is that?
Three hundred.

298
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,516
What did you bring today?

299
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:03,311
Rice and beans.

300
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,039
No meat, right?
What more could you want?

301
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:12,152
You're not staying with me tonight?

302
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,634
Too bad!

303
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,115
You can't even screw, you fag!

304
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,391
Ask your sister!

305
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:28,590
How's it going?
Fine.

306
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,794
The boss sends this money
and says she'll give you more.

307
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:35,868
There's more work for you.

308
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,036
But you have to leave here
and go back to the Reserve.

309
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,151
What does she say?

310
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,113
She brought us money,
but we have to leave.

311
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,715
Why don't you come live with us?

312
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,077
What do | tell the boss?

313
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,914
Did she give you the money?
Yes.

314
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:26,950
Give it to me, I have to buy
many things, more people are coming.

315
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:29,593
I won't, we have to buy food.

316
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,069
There is a lot to eat in the forest.

317
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:35,111
That's not true,
there's nothing there, just Angué.

318
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,436
Don't think about Angué, the dead
are dead, think of the living.

319
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,995
I won't give it to you, go hunting,
we need the money for food!

320
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,110
I won't give it to you.

321
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:00,475
Mami, I came to help you.

322
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:02,957
Here.

323
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,794
Why did you come?
To help you!

324
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,431
Why did you stop?

325
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,911
Put the water down.
Why?

326
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,439
Put it down.

327
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:27,869
Take my hand.

328
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:29,871
Why 7

329
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,998
I want to be with you.

330
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:36,077
You're too young for me.

331
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:37,678
But I want you.

332
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,634
You're too young.

333
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,438
Mami, I love you.

334
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,278
Me too,
but you're too young for me.

335
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:47,951
We can't.

336
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,188
Papa, Mami doesn't want
to stay with me.

337
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,514
You're too young for her.

338
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,275
But I'll grow.

339
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,796
I'm going to marry her.

340
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:56,437
Come here everybody!

341
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,791
Tito!
Come, I have to talk to you.

342
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,469
Osvaldo, come on.
Nadio!

343
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:19,314
There's good work
at the Fazenda Irajé.

344
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,670
Twenty reais a day, plus meals.

345
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,558
And I'll take you for free.

346
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:27,557
No one's coming, this is
the center of the movement.

347
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,112
How many days of work?

348
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:32,390
Five, one hundred reais,
plus meals, let's go!

349
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:36,548
Let's go to work,
there's nothing left to eat.

350
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,231
No one's leaving.

351
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,875
I'm going to break your truck.

352
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:52,349
Let's go to work.

353
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,395
Get in, come on.

354
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:59,114
You go too.

355
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,709
Let's go!

356
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,598
Off to work!

357
00:58:06,279 --> 00:58:10,158
I'm not going to work, the shaman
ordered me to pray and sing.

358
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,397
Let's go!

359
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,156
Don't go!

360
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,279
Come on!

361
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,039
Come on.

362
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:03,433
Think I'm an idiot?

363
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,190
What the fuck were you thinking
sending money to the Indians?

364
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,595
Do you think by giving them money
they'll leave?

365
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:10,708
I'm working.

366
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,229
You have to understand...

367
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,237
You have to understand that...

368
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,400
You know nothing
about how things work here.

369
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,989
You're a foreigner
who just got here.

370
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,237
The next time you speak to me
like that, I'm leaving, clear?

371
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,716
Don't butt into my affairs,
I know how to resolve things.

372
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,351
She went and got an Indian woman
to work here...

373
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:41,950
Who's making all this ruckus?

374
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,069
I don't want to hear
those shit songs.

375
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:50,191
Shut your mouths.

376
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:30,708
What are those?
We're making braids for children.

377
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:32,468
What's your name?

378
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:34,032
Jessica.

379
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,113
What did you bring?

380
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,309
This.

381
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,471
Is this all you brought?

382
01:06:07,279 --> 01:06:09,998
So many days of work
and this is all you bring?

383
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:11,996
You didn't say you were going.

384
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,235
You were very drunk that day.

385
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,678
The center of the movement is here,
you know that.

386
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:21,075
You did what you wanted and
sold yourself to the fazendeiro.

387
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:23,394
Ireneu, aren't you ashamed?

388
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:27,914
You have obligations

389
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:30,510
and you don't obey.

390
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:33,512
Now I want you to leave.

391
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,151
Take this and eat it.

392
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:46,470
You're too hard on your son.

393
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,073
Speak to him more kindly,
he'll take your place someday.

394
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,074
Lia...

395
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,032
I want to say something.

396
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:26,754
What?

397
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,633
I want to be with you.
No, I don't want you.

398
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,630
Why not?
I don't like you.

399
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,475
I'm alone and so are you...

400
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:36,636
But I don't want you.

401
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:39,196
Why not?

402
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,997
I want you.

403
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:45,672
Come on.

404
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,840
You'll die old and alone!

405
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,197
Ireneu... You used to go hunting
and now you won't anymore.

406
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,155
You followed your friends,

407
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,429
you worked in the fields

408
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:16,587
and you sold out
to the fazendeiro.

409
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:21,189
You did this to yourself

410
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:23,151
because you wanted to.

411
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:26,237
No one made you do it.

412
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:55,309
But that's enough now!

413
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,277
|'|| forget you and leave you.

414
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,878
You were my son, my family,

415
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:06,073
but now I want
nothing more to do with you.

416
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,508
I leave you alone, I'm going.

417
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,316
Don't cry, let's leave
or Angué will enter you.

418
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,836
Haven't you ever seen a woman?

419
01:16:02,919 --> 01:16:04,875
Man of the beautiful click!

420
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,598
Lovely Indian!

421
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,711
Long click!

422
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,556
Big click man!

423
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:24,035
Tasty man.

424
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,030
Beautiful man.

425
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,591
Tasty click...

426
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,635
You really have a big one!

427
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,798
Tasty man.

428
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:19,632
Come out!

429
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,467
Out!

430
01:20:39,879 --> 01:20:41,710
This way!

431
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,630
Come this way!

432
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,439
They're talking about
the land in Brasilia,

433
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:06,199
the courts have
to resolve the problem.

434
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,272
As for you, Nadio,

435
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,279
don't let your people
enter in other cultivated fields.

436
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,436
And particularly
not in the residences.

437
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,316
Moreira will commit himself

438
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,034
to keeping his people
from entering this occupied area.

439
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:23,553
If any one of you
does anything foolish,

440
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,479
I'll be forced
to call the federal police.

441
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,717
I don't want justice violated,
okay?

442
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,836
With all due respect,
Mr. Attorney,

443
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,278
I don't see
how you can talk of justice

444
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,590
when this land has been invaded,

445
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,519
a land duly recorded
at the land office.

446
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,710
We don't need papers,

447
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:48,628
I don't understand them
and I don't even care.

448
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:52,070
We are here.

449
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,757
The land is ours.

450
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,518
We no longer have the forest,
we no longer have

451
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,676
anything to survive on.

452
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,916
We're here
and we're staying here.

453
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:13,990
This land...

454
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:18,988
My father arrived here
more than sixty years ago.

455
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,110
That's three generations.

456
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,918
I was born here.

457
01:23:26,519 --> 01:23:28,396
My daughter grew up here.

458
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,951
| work this land
from dawn to dusk,

459
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,909
so that it gives fruit.

460
01:23:37,599 --> 01:23:39,510
| sow nourishment

461
01:23:40,039 --> 01:23:41,791
so that people can eat.

462
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,194
Stay here until Moreira leaves.

463
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,510
Look here...

464
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:47,473
This story pains me deeply.

465
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,472
The only way
to eliminate this anthill

466
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,988
is to find the queen and kill her.

467
01:24:58,839 --> 01:25:01,797
If anything happens
to any of those Indians,

468
01:24:58,839 --> 01:25:01,399
the suspicion of everyone
would fall on me.

469
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:12,908
Moreira,
if you don't uproot this evil,

470
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:16,634
what's happening in your fazenda
will happen in all the others.

471
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,636
Third hut, he's sleeping.

472
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,759
Is that you, Nadio?

473
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,709
No! They'll kill me!

474
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:58,867
Why so many suitcases?
Please...

475
01:29:05,959 --> 01:29:09,156
I'll be gone a while,
three or four months.

476
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,035
Until things get straightened out.

477
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,515
You're the ones who killed Nadio!

478
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,240
You're the ones responsible!

479
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,316
You too, Maria, you're cursed,
you're a whore!

480
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,672
A bitch!

481
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,477
Cowards!
And now you run off!

482
01:29:41,879 --> 01:29:46,191
You bastard!
You killed him!

483
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,156
You wretches!

484
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,553
Get out, fast.

485
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:10,671
I'm not afraid of you!

486
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,239
Or you either!

487
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,750
Put that gun down!

488
01:30:15,919 --> 01:30:17,511
Get out or I'll kill you.

489
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,829
Shoot me in the face then!

490
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,554
Big ears man!
Get out!

491
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,990
You have to do something,

492
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,669
when your boss comes back,

493
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,800
tell him I'll take him

494
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,275
and cut his head off!

495
01:32:27,559 --> 01:32:29,914
I won, you lost.
