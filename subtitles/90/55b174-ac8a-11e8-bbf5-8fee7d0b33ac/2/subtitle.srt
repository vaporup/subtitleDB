1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,600
The Ping River

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,300
You're sure this Jahalang is
son of the North Ho House of Yu?

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,900
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,300
Tai Yang Lake

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,300
Perhaps I should pay
Shao Xing a visit.

6
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,100
Splendid work, everyone!

7
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,800
A toast!

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,500
To victory!

9
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,300
Got that Mongol bitch
on your mind, Jahalang?

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,400
If not, mind if I take her
to my bedroom tonight?

11
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
You're requested at a meeting
in Lady Jin's room.

12
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,300
What kind of meeting is this?

13
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,400
Take a seat.

14
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Since neither of us like being
in crowds,

15
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,200
Let us celebrate on our own.

16
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,400
If this is what you called me for
I'm leaving now.

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
There's something I want to know.

18
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,900
Jahalang, I know you well.

19
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,500
Now that you've fulfilled your aim,

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,900
the coming fight
will have no meaning for you.

21
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,100
Now what will you fight for?

22
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,800
The 'trophy' in the lady's chambers?

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,400
Or perhaps you could fight for me?

24
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,700
Not for you.

25
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,100
You shouldn't be outside yet.

26
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,500
You play very well.

27
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,900
I'm not that good.

28
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,800
Uncle plays much better...

29
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,700
You mean the man who saved me?

30
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,900
Alisu! Tell me who he is!
How can I see him?

31
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,900
He sometimes comes
to the cave behind the house.

32
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
He's there now...

33
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you for taking care of him.
You have quite a fate, Jinha.

34
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,800
A father who can't reveal
his face or voice to his own son.

35
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Let me speak to him!

36
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,900
This must be fate, too.

37
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
My name is Namgung Sung.

38
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,100
I am grateful to you
for saving my life,

39
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
but I dare ask another favor of you.

40
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,900
Take me as your apprentice, Master!

41
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,800
I must take revenge on
a man called Jahalang.

42
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Get out.

43
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Sullie...

44
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Get out.

45
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm not the one you used to know.

46
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,100
What do you want me to do?

47
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,300
Everything ended the day
you came to me as a killer.

48
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,900
Sung is alive.

49
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,800
Once we take the Nan Xi River,

50
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,200
we'll never have to see
another Mongol in this land.

51
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,000
Jahalang, once again
we trust in your skill.

52
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
Call in Yeo Jin.

53
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Once again, I put my faith
in you for this mission.

54
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,900
Remember each of your duties.

55
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,100
Welcome, Marshal Heo.

56
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,000
Greetings. I came to bring you news.

57
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,000
What is it?

58
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Is it true you are interested
in the Mongol girl?

59
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,900
If so, it's such a tragedy.
She's dead.

60
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,200
A great fire swept through her room.

61
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,100
Everything is burned. You can't even
distinguish the bones.

62
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,600
I can't believe you came.

63
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,100
Did you do this?
l wanted you so much!

64
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,800
Come away with me.
I'll abandon everything.

65
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,900
You... All I need is you.

66
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,900
You're the first to remain standing
after being poisoned with Mihon.

67
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Seize him!

68
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
What did you say?

69
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,100
He crept in at night
to kill Jo, Baek Seung,

70
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,600
but was caught and executed.

71
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,800
The Mongols must have paid him off.

72
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,100
That's ridiculous.
Do you continue to side with him?

73
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's be frank.
I'll talk to the governor.

74
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,300
Now that the Ten Swordsmen
have no marshal,

75
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,000
we'll need a new one...

76
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,900
What do you think?

77
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
Not bad.

78
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,400
You're smart.

79
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,400
You must follow the current
to make your way in life!

80
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,100
I just lost my chief.

81
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,400
How can I trust a scoundrel
like Jo, Baek Seung?

82
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
Do as you please.

83
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,100
No one on earth can save you now!

84
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,900
If you wish to stay alive,

85
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
tell me where you keep
the Bichun Secrets!

86
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,400
So you were after the Secrets?

87
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,600
Why else would I take in
a Koryo like you?

88
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,800
It's not in his room.

89
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Then go after his Koryo friend!

90
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,300
If Jahalang doesn't have it
then he probably does.

91
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
You know the place, don't you?
Yes, sir!

92
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,400
Sajune, go with them!
Make sure it's done properly.

93
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,300
That's all the information you have?

94
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,800
He's alive but
you don't know where he is?

95
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,400
It's difficult, since
it's in Qing Chen Bang.
I'll look into it again.

96
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,400
No, I'll go myself.

97
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
What's going on?

98
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Run, quick!
Sir!

99
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,200
Remember, Sung!
You're of Koryo blood!

100
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,400
You must guard the master's
Bichun Secrets!... Alisu!

101
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Brother!

102
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,800
You're awake.

103
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,100
Good thing I came when I did,

104
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,500
but you're something else.

105
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,200
Alone against three men!

106
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,300
Brother...

107
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,100
You should leave now, sir.
No need to stay for long in Shao Xing.

108
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,500
Do you think it's true
that Jo has killed Jahalang?

109
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
People have coveted
the Secrets for a long time.

110
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,500
I'm sorry, Lai.

111
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,400
I must leave to finish some task.

112
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,700
Please take care of yourself.

113
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,900
This is for Yu, Jinha!

114
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,600
It's remarkable that
he's still alive.

115
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
The poison has spread
throughout his body.

116
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,000
That's enough, you may go.
My lady, it's too late to cure him.

117
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,600
You could get infected yourself.

118
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,900
That is none of your concern.

119
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,800
I wasn't able to
cure you completely.

120
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,800
If you use your sword before
regaining your strength,

121
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,200
the effects of the poison
will recur.

122
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Please... wait until you recover.

123
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
They were hiding in a cave.

124
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Brother!

125
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Kill them!

126
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,800
Uncle! Uncle...

127
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,700
What did you call him?

128
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Uncle? That's a lie!

129
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,800
That's Jahalang! Not my Master!

130
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,200
My master isn't a murderer!
Please stop it!

131
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,300
You shouldn't treat him that way!

132
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,100
He...

133
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,400
He's your father!

134
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
The area is in chaos.

135
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
We must do something, quickly.

136
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,200
You've found the Mongols?
Yes, sir.

137
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,100
Get the girl first,
in the name of revenge.

138
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,300
And Jahalang?

139
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,500
Once we have the girl,
he's as good as ours.

140
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,500
If all goes well, you will be
our next governor, my lord.

141
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,700
Are you awake?

142
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,200
Lady Sullie has killed
Jo, Baek Seung.

143
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,800
She's staying in the house
behind Yu Hua Pagoda.

144
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,300
You should rest.

145
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Changlyong...

146
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,600
Thank you.

147
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,100
Look closely, Namgung Sung!

148
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
This is your master's true identity.

149
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,300
What are you waiting for?

150
00:30:53,300 --> 00:31:00,800
Tell me. Did you do it to
punish my mother?

151
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,200
Your mother did nothing wrong.

152
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,800
I didn't understand the world then.

153
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,200
Listen to me well.

154
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,400
You are Namgung Sung!

155
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,000
Do you understand?

156
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Follow me.

157
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,800
You shouldn't have come.

158
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,900
What do you mean?

159
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,800
I am your husband
and you are my wife!

160
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,700
We've lived together for 10 years!

161
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,900
You don't understand...

162
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,300
Why I made up my mind to live.

163
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,600
Sung is not your son.

164
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,400
I wanted to mix his bloodline
with the House of Namgung.

165
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,500
Because I hated my father...

166
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,600
and I hated you.

167
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,900
I knew that.

168
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,600
I thought that I deserved it.

169
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll never forget his eyes when
I pushed him toward the cliff,

170
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,400
out of selfish desire
to have you for my own.

171
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,300
I never thought I'd be able
to speak of it...

172
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm not sure about you,
but I was happy.

173
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Come back as my wife, Sullie...

174
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,000
I'd rather you killed me.

175
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Then we'd both be free of Jinha.

176
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,800
I wonder about the bond
between you two.

177
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,500
If there's such a thing as fate,
that must be it.

178
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,000
I wanted to say thank you.

179
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,600
Sung!

180
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,500
It's been a long time, Jinha.

181
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,900
Let's not stand on ceremony,
shall we?

182
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,400
If I die, take care of Sullie.
Sullie is your wife!

183
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,600
Lift up your sword.

184
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,000
Lift your sword
and attack me, Jinha!

185
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Now we can remain friends.

186
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,700
Welcome.

187
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,500
Jahalang's end is near, my lord!

188
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,000
You should see them, sir.
No need.

189
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,000
I've ordered the men to stand by.

190
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:35,400
It's a personal matter.
We'll part ways here.

191
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,300
I can't do that.
That's an order, Changlyong!

192
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,400
Yes, sir.

193
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,100
Take care.

194
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,600
Where is Jinha now?

195
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,800
He left.
Where did he go?

196
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,600
He's looking for a place to die.

197
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,300
Go back!

198
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,700
Go back!

199
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Go back!

200
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,300
What about Sung?

201
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,400
Who'll take care of him?

202
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,700
I'm sorry.

203
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,400
I'm leaving you again...

204
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,800
Sullie...

205
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,500
Sung...
Take care of Sung...

206
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,100
My name is Sullie. Sullie.
And you?

207
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,900
Jinha.
