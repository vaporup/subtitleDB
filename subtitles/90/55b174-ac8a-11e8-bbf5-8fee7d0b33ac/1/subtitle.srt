controlled China, but anti-Yuan

00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,181
Mother!

15
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,696
My name is Sullie. Sullie.

16
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,736
And you?
Jinha.

17
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,467
My name is Sullie. Sullie.

18
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,743
And you?
Jinha.

19
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,326
Here. From today, you can
practice with a real sword.

20
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,065
My father is finally coming.

21
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,678
But what's the use?

22
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,050
Mother is so sick...

23
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:49,814
Whatever may happen
stay with me always.

24
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,299
You said I start with
the sword today?

25
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,246
Out of the way!

26
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,643
Insolence!

27
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,019
Leave him. We must press on.
Yes, General.

28
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,249
A fine-featured lad.

29
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,223
What is your name?

30
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,498
I... I'm of lowly birth
and have no family name.

31
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,366
My name is Jinha, sir.

32
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,268
Father, we should go now.
We should be at her deathbed.

33
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,199
Jinha, bring me some water.

34
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,774
We're going to Shao Xing.

35
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,785
Mother's body isn't even cold yet.

36
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,483
I'll ask the officials to
take care of the funeral.

37
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,122
I'm not leaving.
You're my daughter.

38
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,264
You go with me.

39
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,629
I don't want to!

40
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,201
Let go of me!

41
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,098
Let go!
Sullie!

42
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,773
Sullie!
Jinha!

43
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,886
Brother!

44
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,253
Don't!

45
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,550
If he dies, so do l!

46
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,771
Jinha! Jinha!

47
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,571
I'm sorry.

48
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,713
I have to leave.

49
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,047
I won't leave you.

50
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:12,787
Listen! Every full-moon day, I'll wait
at Yu Hua Pagoda in Shao Xing.

51
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,052
You have to remember.
Yu Hua Pagoda!

52
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,443
Shao Xing. Taruga Manor.

53
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,526
Young lord, just as I heard
you do carry a joke too far.

54
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:53,895
But isn't it so?

55
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,334
I can't find any serviceable women.

56
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,964
No beauties like Yi, Su Yon of old...

57
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,073
Did it cost too much for you to get
beauties like that, General?

58
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:16,885
My lord.

59
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:41,243
What's the matter? Drink up!

60
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,216
Ah, do you lack music?

61
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,703
Who dares interrupt my music?

62
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,651
Quite pretty for a Mongol's servant.

63
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,019
What's your name?

64
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,687
A proud one, aren't you?

65
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,427
Don't you want to change your lot?

66
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,872
Quiet!

67
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,112
You should have slapped him
some more while you were at it!

68
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:29,248
Fool! No one in Shao Xing can survive
after provoking a Namgung lord!

69
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,887
Why don't you just crush them
like the House of Yu in North Ho?

70
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,753
Shut up!

71
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,220
Why should descendants of the
great Mongols kowtowto that
kind of Han scoundrel?

72
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,193
I said shut up!

73
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:46,364
Do not mention the Namgung lords
or the House of Yu ever again!

74
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,973
It's been six months already.

75
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,906
Let's leave for Shao Xing now.

76
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,906
Forget about Sullie!

77
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,410
Uncle!

78
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,046
Once you perfect
the Bichun Secret Arts,

79
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,213
there are things that you must do.

80
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,086
I will go to Shao Xing
with or without you.

81
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,483
You almost got yourself killed!

82
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,827
Would Sullie even look at you?

83
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,728
She may be a concubine's child,

84
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,289
but she's the daughter of a rich
and powerful Mongol general!

85
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,727
Wealth and glory are
stretched out before her.

86
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,030
Look at yourself!

87
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,168
You have nothing!
Stop it!

88
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,589
We had a hard time finding you.

89
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,127
Give us the Bichun Secrets!

90
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,332
You'll have to kill me if you want
even a glimpse of it.

91
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,546
Uncle!

92
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,318
Jinha...

93
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,915
Uncle!

94
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,071
You must be exhausted.

95
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,841
Why did you insist on coming here?

96
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,478
There is something I must show you.

97
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,036
This was once the greatest manor
in North Ho.

98
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,229
The great House of Yu.

99
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:21,004
The master swordsman Yu, Jangok
was neither a Mongol nor a Han.

100
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,806
He was from Koryo (ancient Korea),
a Koryo.

101
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:31,953
He was a hostage from Koryo
the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

102
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:40,396
His wife Yi, Suyon, a Koryo woman
was the greatest beauty in North Ho.

103
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:46,869
The bloody murders were said to be
a strike against anti-Yuan forces.

104
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:55,838
But actually they were after
the ultimate Secrets held by Yu.

105
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,546
Master Yu!
Go, quickly!

106
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,884
Master Yu!

107
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,160
Most tragic of all was Mistress Yi.

108
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,105
After a desperate escape,

109
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,110
she had to abandon the last Yu heir.

110
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,109
And tragically...

111
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,413
Why are you saying this, Uncle?

112
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,429
Young Master! I am not your uncle.

113
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:26,569
I'm Master Yu's swordman, Kwakjung.

114
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:37,072
Once you perfect
the Bichun Secret Arts,

115
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,414
you must revenge your parents

116
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,815
so that they can rest in peace.

117
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:54,289
I only regret that I cannot
reveal who the enemy is...

118
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:03,332
Forgive my disloyalty over the years.

119
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,214
Uncle!

120
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,192
Uncle!

121
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,829
Uncle!

122
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,623
I heard you come here
every full-moon day.

123
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,630
If you're going back soon
why not join me?

124
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,778
I must wait here until sunset.

125
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,125
What do you mean?

126
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,554
Refuse his proposal of marriage?
He's not my man.

127
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,194
I won't let you behave like a child
as you did in Shan Mei!

128
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,034
Is it the Bichun Secrets
you're after?

129
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:09,251
How about we stand-ins
fight with each other?

130
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,743
Thank you.

131
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,345
I hope I wasn't interfering.

132
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,609
I am Namgung Junkwang.

133
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,816
What is your name, great swordman?
Jinha.

134
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,088
I am Yu, Jinha.

135
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,033
Brother Yu, you remind me of someone.

136
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,367
Someone no longer of this world.

137
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,034
I myself have only seen her portrait.

138
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,707
Yi, Suyon of the old House
of Yu in North Ho.

139
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,349
When I was a boy
she was my first love.

140
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,155
You don't talk much, Brother Yu.

141
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,859
You seem to have traveled a lot.
Tell me some stories of the world.

142
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,763
Have you ever loved a woman
such that it drove you mad?

143
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,004
I adored her at first sight.

144
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,276
After a lifetime of wandering
a light has come to brighten my life.

145
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,810
I knew it the moment I saw her.

146
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,713
Does she love you, too?

147
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,158
I will make her love me.

148
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,392
Show this when you visit me
and you will be served courteously.

149
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,694
Be sure to drop by once
your business is finished.

150
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,100
I would like to hear
more of the world from you.

151
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,368
So you will.

152
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,834
Excuse me, can you tell me
where Taruga Manor is?

153
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,500
I think it's on the main street.

154
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,580
And the Namgung lord's manor?

155
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,576
Those two houses...
you must be going to the wedding!

156
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,378
A wedding?

157
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,884
You haven't heard?
It's the talk of the town!

158
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,819
Lord Namgung's only son is

159
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:41,090
marrying the daughter of
General Taruga's concubine.

160
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,931
What a great distinction
for a concubine's daughter!

161
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,251
Where do you think you're going?

162
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,389
Have you forgotten that young
Lord Namgung is coming today?

163
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:13,855
That is none of my concern.
You will see to him courteously!

164
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,416
This was not my decision.

165
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,821
Is accepting me so difficult?

166
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:50,128
My lord, you and I are worlds apart.

167
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,995
Please do not mock me.

168
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,704
I never thought to beg
for love in such a manner.

169
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,203
Please accept my proposal.

170
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:20,162
Are you sure this Yu, Jinha is
of the North Ho House of Yu?
Yes!

171
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,165
I should have recognized him
in Shan Mei.

172
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:29,171
But I'll end his life yet.
He defeated the men I sent.

173
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,537
He used the Bichun Secrets.
Shut up!

174
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:37,874
Do you think he knows
about the Yu Manor incident?

175
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:46,718
Don't worry. If we dispose of him
and gain the Bichun Secrets
we will rule supreme.

176
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,821
Isn't that so, my dear in-law?

177
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,339
So this was the
Yu Hua Pagoda promise?

178
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,116
Defeat me.

179
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,816
Jinha

180
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,947
Take good care of her.

181
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,808
Search everywhere!
Yes, sir!

182
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,981
Young lord, this is
not a place for you to be.

183
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,157
My betrothed is missing!

184
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,125
Who is the scoundrel?

185
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,026
I've told you several times
you've misunderstood.

186
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,191
Tell me who the scoundrel is!

187
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,565
The son of the ruined North Ho Yu's.
His name is Jinha.

188
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,033
He has taken my daughter
as vengeance, no doubt.

189
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:05,243
You mean the scoundrel
is Yu, Jinha?

190
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,324
Jinha!

191
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,116
Father will kill you! Run!
My lady!

192
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,412
Let go of me!
You're not different from them!

193
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,686
You're the one who should
atone for your crime, Father!

194
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,857
Wasn't it enough to destroy
the House of Yu in North Ho?

195
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,019
Now you want to kill Jinha, too?
Quiet!

196
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,073
Our fates are ill-crossed.

197
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,508
The General seems to want
the Bichun Secrets.

198
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:15,981
But not l. I can't endure
another man in her heart.

199
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,579
Defeat me. Then you can live.

200
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,227
If you are at a disadvantage
jump to the side.

201
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,595
We'll shoot arrows.

202
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,132
I don't want to fight you.

203
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,660
Sullie doesn't love you.

204
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,830
I will marry him.

205
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,841
Are you going to Ping River?

206
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,209
What did you say?

207
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,686
I said, are you going to Ping River?

208
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,455
Yes.

209
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,922
It'll take a while this time
I'm worried about you.

210
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:12,567
I don't know how Shao Xing
got so infested with assassins.

211
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,729
The other day, an imperial envoy
was killed in the street.

212
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,274
Mongolians are afraid to
go out at night.

213
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:26,476
Don't worry about me.
Just have a good trip.

214
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,385
I'll come back as soon as possible.

215
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,680
Don't change the subject
Lord Namgung!

216
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:09,416
Do you think the Namgungs who
were favored by the Emperor
will be left unscathed?

217
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,687
I haven't lived to this age
without learning that much.

218
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:19,400
But I cannot invest in
war funds again.

219
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:25,368
There is nothing left for Mongol
glory but to withdraw from
history's foreground

220
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,909
and go back to the prairie.

221
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,776
Merchants don't trust any rulers.

222
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,818
We only believe in
the ruling principles of life.

223
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:48,828
Since you're here
why don't you see your daughter?

224
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,767
Still no news from Lai?

225
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:00,569
None after a sighting
at the Tai Yang Lake battle.

226
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,840
I'm leaving. Say goodbye
to Lord Namgung for me.

227
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,694
You must be stronger than ever now
and live undaunted!

228
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,058
Forget about the
other half of your blood...

229
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,058
We won't see each other again...

230
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:39,091
You've grown old, General.

231
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,189
Do it!

232
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,650
Let's escape, Mother.

233
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,681
Let's escape somehow,

234
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,894
and go to Ping River
where Father is.

235
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,623
I'm going to revenge myself
on that killer, whatever it takes.

236
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,572
We've secured all of
Namgung's estate.

237
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,275
And, sir, this...

238
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,818
We found it in the storage room.

239
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,546
We saw the title
Yi, Suyon of the House of Yu.

240
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,619
It seems to be
your mother's portrait, sir.

241
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,427
You're dismissed.

242
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,224
Mother! Mother!

243
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:24,229
Go, quickly! Go, right now!

244
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,327
I said go!

245
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:59,064
Are you so undisciplined
that you fumble over a trifle?

246
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:04,869
You're the one who let the
Mongol girl stay in her room!

247
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,241
I should be entitled to that much.

248
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,350
And the child?

249
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,425
The boys are after him
so don't worry about the brat.

250
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,965
Brother, he's awake!

251
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,929
Where am l?

252
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:44,671
Who are you?

253
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,277
The wound isn't deep.

254
01:00:55,652 --> 01:01:00,248
Jinha... what about Sung?

255
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,651
I beg you. Let him live!

256
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,658
He is everything to me,

257
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,364
the only reason I kept living...
Enough!

258
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,269
Stop it!

259
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,703
Jinha, please...

260
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:30,151
He's our son, yours and mine!

261
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,608
Long years as a powerful man's wife

262
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,508
has made you this cunning, hasn't it?

263
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,898
The Ping River
