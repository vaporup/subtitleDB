1
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,598
Lord Ganesh!

2
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,033
Lord Ganesh!

3
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,736
Lord Ganesh!

4
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,465
Lord Ganesh!

5
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,938
Lord Ganesh!

6
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,532
Lord Ganesh!

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,042
Lord Ganesh!

8
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,677
Lord Ganesh!

9
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,621
Shambu, we've got the
license for the salt factory.

10
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,018
Go tell Master Sir, run along...

11
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,492
Hello Landlord! Greetings Landlord!

12
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,934
Master Sir's here!
- Hello, master.

13
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,708
Greetings Master!
- Bless me, Master.

14
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,477
Hello Mr. Landlord!

15
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,980
What's the matter Sir?

16
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,477
They seem to
honouring you more than ever!

17
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,451
Oh... what are you saying?!

18
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,023
Sister, Viju's here.

19
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,166
Viju, go for it!

20
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,510
Very good! Very good!

21
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,643
Go for it.
- Master... Sir, look!

22
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,184
Suhasini.
- What?

23
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,126
Very good!

24
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,741
Surya, this isn't enough.

25
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,613
It's enough for you.

26
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,182
Surya, everyone has a
right over this money.

27
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,653
It must be distributed equally.

28
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,685
Smartass! You take your share...

29
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,851
Don't worry about the others.

30
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,626
Don't be a hero!

31
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,197
I insist, equal distribution!

32
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,560
Get lost!

33
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,127
Equal distribution, you wish!

34
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,566
Let's go.

35
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,230
Surya...

36
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,019
Vijay, stop. What are you doing?

37
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,586
Vijay... I said stop.

38
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,888
Father, that is our money...
- Vijay

39
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,154
Vijay, you don't have to cry...

40
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,826
Then what do you want me to do?

41
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,203
Beg and plead to people?

42
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,830
No, you shouldn't do that either.

43
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,965
So you want me to
live like a coward then?

44
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,139
I broke the pot, and he
took away all the money.

45
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,177
Is this what your Gita preaches?

46
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,644
If I see him around,
I'll punch his face.

47
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,813
And then what will happen?

48
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,588
He will punch your face, then
you'll punch him back again...

49
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,624
and then he'll punch you back.

50
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,592
And it will never end.

51
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,659
"An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind..."

52
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,233
...Mahatma Gandhi once said...

53
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,305
Mahatma Gandhi wasn't born in Mandwa!

54
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,273
My son has a lot of
anger inside of him.

55
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,038
You only preach to me.

56
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,839
Why don't you tell the others?

57
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,178
Because you are my son.

58
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,911
Come...

59
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,047
come now.

60
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,394
It isn't wrong to
care about the world...

61
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,161
but before the world
comes your own family.

62
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,364
And this is why I'm
looking out for my family.

63
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,031
I'm not telling you
to be a coward, Vijay.

64
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,039
It is important to have power...

65
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,109
the question is how you use it.

66
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,309
The weak can't say that they
have forgiven the powerful.

67
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,187
For that, the weak must
themselves become powerful.

68
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,725
Then whether or not to
forgive is up to you.

69
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,926
If you do forgive, you
will be hailed as great.

70
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,390
If not...

71
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,327
then you will be nothing.

72
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,867
And till you become powerful,
you get beaten up everyday.

73
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,128
Says who?

74
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,771
Keep reciting the verse with me.

75
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,933
I've done it a million times, father.

76
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,941
So what? Do it once more.

77
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,944
I derive my strength from this.

78
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,910
You shall too.

79
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,313
There you stand, a tall tree

80
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,382
You are well-laden and tall

81
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,753
But don't ever ask
for even a little shade

82
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,091
On the path of fire

83
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,160
On the path of fire

84
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,929
On the path of fire

85
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,000
You will never tire

86
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,341
you will never rest

87
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,737
You...
- Father...

88
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,179
You will never look back

89
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,178
Take an oath

90
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,784
Take an oath

91
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:09,980
Take an oath

92
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,755
Take an oath

93
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,118
On the path of fire

94
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,987
On the path of fire

95
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,356
On the path of fire

96
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,356
Life is but a great scene

97
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,367
Life is but a great scene

98
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,334
That man is walking on

99
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,429
That man is walking on

100
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,273
With tears and sweat

101
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,868
Soaked in blood

102
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,139
Soaked in blood

103
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,275
On the path of fire

104
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,476
On the path of fire

105
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,945
On the path of fire

106
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,061
You have ruled over
Mandwa for years Sir.

107
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,100
Earlier, you were the king and
the people were your subjects.

108
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,397
The Master is becoming the king now.

109
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,299
Do something sir...

110
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,772
or even you will
become one of the subjects.

111
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,442
School textbooks are growing
more important than our Registers.

112
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,246
When does Kancha get here?

113
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,919
Tomorrow morning.

114
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,242
Hey baldie!

115
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,074
Hey baldie!

116
00:10:53,586 --> 00:11:02,358
No... no... I don't want mirrors...

117
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,356
No... I don't want mirrors.

118
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,126
Kancha! - I don't want mirrors.
- Kancha! - I don't want. - Kancha!

119
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,501
No, Kancha my son... My child.

120
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,511
Father... everyone looks at
me and calls me a ghost!

121
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,610
Father, do I...
do I look like a ghost?

122
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,350
Don't worry.

123
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,585
You are but my own father.

124
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:39,926
But then what's a father, a mother,
a brother or a sister?

125
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,033
What did you get with you...

126
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,334
and what will you take back?

127
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,274
Only one will survive...

128
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,942
the supreme...

129
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,712
and all powerful...

130
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,181
Kancha...

131
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,094
You should have held
up for a while longer.

132
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,632
I would have been dead. Sir...

133
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,361
Here's your share... 600 only.

134
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,561
Take it.

135
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,262
600.
- 600.

136
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,299
Now it's his turn sir...

137
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,438
now your turn... yours... yours. Come.
- Go for it!

138
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,240
Two hundred...

139
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,547
three hundred...
- Three hundred...

140
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,353
four hundred...

141
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,150
Sir...

142
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,256
Sir... he will die...

143
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,733
Sir... He will die...

144
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,229
Sir... he will die...

145
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,738
Sir, what are you doing?
- I don't want.

146
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,200
Sir... he will die...

147
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,301
What are you doing?

148
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,671
Sir... Sir... Sir...

149
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,574
Sir... he will die...

150
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,675
Sir... he will die...

151
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,348
Master...

152
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,704
Life is a lot more
precious than this game, Kancha.

153
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,232
Life is submerged underwater Master...

154
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,702
it's begging and pleading.

155
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,514
Because today life means...

156
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,378
money...

157
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,317
money...

158
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,353
Sniff it Master...

159
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,094
you'll know what bliss means.

160
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,295
You've stepped into Mandwa
after a long time Kancha.

161
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,728
Let Mandwa respect you properly.

162
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,202
What respect are you talking about,
Master? I would've...

163
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,499
...taken it in my arms.
- Sir...

164
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,234
But the earth has heated up Master...

165
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,469
embracing her would be fatal.

166
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,842
Do you understand
what I mean by fatal...

167
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,175
an illness...

168
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,744
destruction...

169
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,379
disease.

170
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,256
And this disease will spread Master...

171
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,417
in front of your very eyes,
it will spread.

172
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,789
Brothers...

173
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,101
I've come here to
repay my loyalty to Mandwa.

174
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,670
I will set up a salt factory here...

175
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,174
Factory!

176
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,574
Our salt will sell outside...

177
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,110
It will command unheard of prices...

178
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,843
and we will earn unforeseen revenues.
- Fantastic!

179
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,847
But for that...

180
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,350
I need your land on lease.

181
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,187
Lease.
- Lease. - What's lease?!

182
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,318
I mean loan!
- Loan. - Loan.

183
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,261
Loan!

184
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,895
I mean it will be on loan with me.

185
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,362
The profits of the land are yours...

186
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,835
the revenue is yours...

187
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,210
only the factory is mine,
and the money it makes is mine.

188
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,506
What do you say?

189
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,674
We accept!

190
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,344
We accept!

191
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,656
Do you have faith in your Master?

192
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,200
Yes, we do.

193
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:41,204
Then promise you won't
loan your lands to Kancha.

194
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,208
Oh rain come to me,

195
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,836
I shall give you a bribe.

196
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,673
The bribe you have accepted,

197
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,250
the storm has arrived.

198
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,415
He's taking your land on
lease for a hundred years.

199
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,855
Which one you will
live that long to see...

200
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,859
...what he actually
does with your land?

201
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,428
When it rains...

202
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,764
the land of Mandwa sprouts a plant...

203
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,559
coca!

204
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,832
Our own salt factory is
enough for Mandwa's progress.

205
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,700
We shall be both the owners
and the workers of that factory.

206
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,802
All it'll take is a little
patience and hard work...

207
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,640
From Coca, Cocaine is made...

208
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,210
whose taste causes a
man to forget himself...

209
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,787
whose smell makes a man feel
like he's flying in the sky...

210
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,425
it sells in the outside
markets for millions...

211
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,459
and it's been here all along...

212
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,367
yet you dimwits couldn't see it.

213
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,397
So tell Kancha that you
won't give him your land.

214
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,906
We won't!

215
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,671
Landlord, Sir...

216
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,003
the Master is conducting a meeting
with the villagers under the tree.

217
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,679
Master...

218
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,848
Master...

219
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,026
Surya said you wanted to see me.

220
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,294
Master...

221
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,937
I remember switching the lights off...

222
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,041
Suhasini, I'll be right back.

223
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,511
What's the matter?
Where are you going?

224
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,310
I guess I left the school lights on.

225
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,647
Viju, go along with your father.

226
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,012
Father, wait for me.

227
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,693
Soorti.

228
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,701
Father...

229
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,809
Wait here.

230
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,614
Bindiya...

231
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,048
Bindiya...

232
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,516
Bindiya... What happened?

233
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,918
What happened?

234
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,853
How did this happen?

235
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,054
Bindiya...

236
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,589
Tell me, how did this happen?

237
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,761
Vijay...

238
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,928
why are you still there?

239
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,369
Get your mother, quick!

240
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,965
Hurry up!

241
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,668
Yes... tell me...

242
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,376
How did this happen?

243
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,040
Bindiya... open your eyes.

244
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,110
Uncle...

245
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,909
something happened to
Bindiya in school...

246
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,479
Listen to me...

247
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,677
Don't spare him!

248
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,875
Mother...

249
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,418
Mother, something
happened to Bindiya in school...

250
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,815
Father, has called you.

251
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,787
Mother!

252
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,051
Viju...

253
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,019
Bindiya...

254
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,655
Where is Bindiya?

255
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,755
Bindiya. Bindiya.
- Master, where is she?

256
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,659
There is Bindiya.

257
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,429
Bindiya...
- Bindiya...

258
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,634
Bindiya, how did this happen?

259
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:34,865
Bindiya, what happened?

260
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,770
Bindiya! What happened?

261
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,706
Speak up, dear. What happened?

262
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,471
Why did you come here? Who called you?

263
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,606
Answer, who called you here?

264
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,976
What happened?
- What happened, my dear?

265
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,051
Master...
- Master...

266
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,082
Master...

267
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,416
what did you do to this little girl?

268
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,785
I didn't do anything...

269
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,885
Master, Bindiya is
pointing towards you.

270
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,528
Bindiya...

271
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,532
Bindiya...

272
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,030
Master, how could you?

273
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,198
Darn you!
- Wait!

274
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,500
Have you lost it? - Of course!
You are the Master's disciple!

275
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,171
Listen to me...

276
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,606
So... Master, what did you do?

277
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,841
Speak up?
- What are you insinuating?

278
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,474
What did you do to her?

279
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,212
Will you at least listen to me.

280
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:27,515
Darn you, master! How
could you do this, Master?

281
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,860
Viju... be careful, my dear...

282
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,996
You killed our daughter!

283
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,563
Kill him...

284
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,963
What are you...
- You killed our daughter!

285
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,036
Kill him.
- Wait...

286
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,865
Wait...

287
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,539
Wait...

288
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,673
Step back, I say.

289
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,007
Step back...

290
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,529
Mother...

291
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,097
Go to your father...

292
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,272
Go to your father.

293
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,198
Father...

294
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,942
Son.
- Let my father go...

295
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,838
Father...

296
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,332
You see, Vijay...

297
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,338
your father has committed a grave sin!

298
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,975
He doesn't deserve to live!

299
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,135
He is the scum of our village...
- No!

300
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,678
Father!

301
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,839
You will pay for it, Master!

302
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,883
Your ghost will hang from the tree!

303
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,850
Kill him!
- Father!

304
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,180
All of us honoured your father...

305
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,849
and he has put our honour to shame...

306
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,323
today we will kill your father!

307
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,190
We'll kill him and
hang him from this tree!

308
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,320
Hang him on the banyan tree.

309
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,728
Father!

310
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:05,269
A little jolt on the path of
Mandwa's progress and well-being.

311
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,104
Father...

312
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,441
Father...

313
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,384
Father...

314
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,691
Father...

315
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,132
What did you get with you...

316
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,033
and what will you take back?

317
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,906
There's no need to worry...

318
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,100
and no need to be afraid of anyone...

319
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,808
Who can kill you?

320
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,778
The soul is neither born nor dies.

321
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:53,121
The soul is neither born nor dies.

322
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:58,922
The soul is neither born nor dies.

323
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:04,299
The soul is neither born nor dies.

324
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:10,169
The soul is neither born nor dies.

325
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,472
Father...

326
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,908
Father!

327
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,410
Father!

328
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,147
Father!

329
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,821
Dead!

330
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,424
The master is dead!

331
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,053
Farewell Master!

332
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,998
Father!

333
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,832
Father!

334
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,464
Father!

335
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,239
He got what he deserved.
- The master is dead!

336
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,049
Father!

337
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,077
Nobody will give wood for his pyre.

338
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,949
Let him hang here.

339
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,821
Master, you won't
even have a cremation!

340
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,523
Let him rot.

341
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,852
Mandwa has been rid of this demon.

342
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,521
Vultures

343
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,957
Leave him hanging...

344
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,432
Nobody will give wood for his pyre.

345
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,182
Mother... Mother, what happened?

346
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,014
Mother... Mother, what happened?

347
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,854
Tell me, mother. Mother!

348
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,453
Mother, say something!

349
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,497
Mother, what is it?

350
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,154
What happened, mother?

351
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,465
I don't know what's
happening to my mother...

352
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,866
Please help!

353
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,335
Get lost kid!

354
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,429
It's time for business, so scram!

355
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,266
Somebody help my mother!

356
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,434
Get lost!

357
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,304
What the...

358
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,074
I don't know what's
happening to my mother...

359
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,483
She is in pain... I
don't know what's happening!

360
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,051
Where is your mother?
- There!

361
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,355
Mother... are you alright?

362
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,552
Is my mother alright?

363
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,320
She will be okay, right?

364
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,054
She is having labor pain.

365
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,889
Kali what are you staring at?
Hurry up and get Ashatai!

366
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,398
Oh God!

367
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,496
What happened, Lachi?

368
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,936
Nothing yet, but something sure will!

369
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,302
Take a look!
- Mother!

370
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,466
What are you crying for?

371
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,133
Take him away from here.

372
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,338
Take him away... go!

373
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,242
Dulari, we need cover!

374
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,680
Vijay!
- Mother!

375
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,144
All of you, what are you
staring at? Come fast!

376
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,518
Take a deep breath, my dear...

377
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,231
Mother!

378
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,931
Step back.

379
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,208
Go away.

380
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,040
You have a sister.

381
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,112
Here...

382
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,053
be careful.

383
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,519
What about my mother?

384
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,094
You mother is fine.

385
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,254
Mummy's boy!

386
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,713
Not like this!

387
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,077
This is how you tie it.

388
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,181
This is the problem with new people.

389
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,617
See how it's done.

390
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:34,002
Help! Help!

391
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,186
Get us out of here!

392
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,492
Get us out of here!

393
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,295
Take a look at this
fine specimen, gentlemen.

394
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,493
Leave me!

395
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,729
Fresh as a rose.

396
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,465
She is mine!
- I want her.

397
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,538
I guarantee everything about her.

398
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,201
By the grace of Allah, if
you treat and feed her well...

399
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,640
in a year she will blossom.

400
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,809
May I have the bids...

401
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,282
Thirty thousand!

402
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,448
Thirty thousand!

403
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,752
Forty thousand!

404
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,258
Forty thousand!

405
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,828
Lala bhai, sixty thousand!

406
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,461
Sixty thousand!
Sixty thousand, once...

407
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,759
Sixty thousand, twice... Sold!

408
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,065
Sold!

409
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,169
No!

410
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,231
Where is the stuff from?

411
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:14,731
Afghanistan.

412
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,581
Let me ask again...

413
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,553
where is the stuff from?

414
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,694
How does it matter?
It's genuine stuff.

415
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,491
Where are you growing it?

416
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,496
I want to sell my stuff in Mumbai.

417
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,427
State your demand.

418
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,468
I never liked hide and seek.

419
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,767
Whether the girl is of
eleven or sixteen...

420
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,270
I buy her.

421
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:02,880
The catch is I
should know her real age.

422
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:05,881
Now listen...

423
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,717
very carefully...

424
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,757
The fact is, Kancha...

425
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,597
I don't seem to like your face.

426
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,859
It's not because you are ugly.

427
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,771
I've seen worse.

428
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,604
But your face is disgusting...

429
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,900
disgusting.

430
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,704
And another thing...

431
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,939
business is conducted among equals.

432
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,708
Equals.

433
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,744
Kancha...

434
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,319
who 15 years ago, was merely a
small time crook in Mumbai...

435
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,221
nobody knows who his mother was...

436
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,454
probably is a bastard, probably not...

437
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,530
but the Police have a
picture in their record...

438
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,457
which is nothing like your face now.

439
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,469
Kancha, leave Mumbai or else...

440
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,902
Bloody Joker!

441
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,969
Joker!

442
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,476
I'm letting you go.

443
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,850
Today is my younger son's birthday.

444
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,251
Don't come again tomorrow.

445
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,449
Tomorrow it isn't his birthday.

446
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,756
Viju...

447
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,730
my mother has sent this.

448
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,561
You got your cut.

449
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,497
Now get lost.

450
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,836
Where is Tatya?

451
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,007
No. Don't do that.

452
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,908
No. Spare me.

453
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,018
My children are very small...

454
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,881
Kancha paid you to kill me...

455
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:47,750
and you accepted!

456
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,784
You accepted!

457
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,954
This bastard took money to kill me.

458
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:54,990
- Suleman! - Yes?

459
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,868
I heard they eat dog
meat in some country...

460
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,561
So have I, bhai...

461
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,902
This dog accepted money to kill me.

462
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm sure he has a large heart...

463
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,606
Let's rip it out and sell it.

464
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,945
We'll get a good price.

465
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,024
You...

466
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,497
Who are you?

467
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,968
Vijay.
- Vijay?

468
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,339
Never saw you before.

469
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,939
How could you, if I wasn't here?

470
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,044
Smartass, huh?

471
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,974
Hey...

472
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:47,876
and who are you?

473
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,816
She is my daughter.

474
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,547
Oh...

475
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,891
she's all grown up and
I haven't noticed...

476
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,685
that's a wonder!

477
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,468
Those whores aren't going to testify.

478
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,061
Lala has cut their tongue.

479
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,700
But there is a twelve year old boy...

480
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,769
he was present at that time.

481
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,039
Then get him to testify.

482
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,944
Come on and don't you dare lie.

483
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,454
Tell us everything you saw
that day, just speak the truth.

484
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,451
Take it easy.

485
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,686
How old are you?

486
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,122
Twelve.

487
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,523
What's your name?

488
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,691
Vijay.

489
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,863
Don't be afraid.

490
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,035
Look carefully...

491
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,937
was it one of them?

492
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,764
It is important to have power...

493
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,537
the question is how you use it.

494
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,470
Don't be afraid... say it.

495
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,102
No.

496
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,539
The Police is with you,
don't be afraid.

497
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,011
No.

498
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,047
Vijay, this is Rauf Lala.

499
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,523
He killed Tatya in broad daylight.

500
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,087
I said it is none of them.

501
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,525
Don't lie, Vijay.

502
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,962
A child's words are the
voice of God, Inspector.

503
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,534
Who can go against that?

504
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,700
So... can I leave?

505
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,500
Come on.

506
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,697
See you.

507
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,554
I want Mandwa...

508
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,683
back.

509
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,224
Everybody fears Lala...

510
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,790
And one day everybody will fear me.

511
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,931
And that very fear will
help us return to Mandwa.

512
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,694
We won't live here anymore.

513
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,799
We will go away.

514
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,770
To a place where you won't
get these wild thoughts.

515
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,502
I'm scared, Vijay.

516
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,145
Scared for you and
your sister Shiksha.

517
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,708
Do you hear what I'm saying?

518
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,914
Viju... Viju, Shinde
is looking for you.

519
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,488
He wants to know why you
refused to identify Lala.

520
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,650
He is beating up my mother.

521
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,125
Viju, please come.

522
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,696
You whore...

523
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,563
where are you hiding the boy?

524
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:59,201
Because of what that boy did,
I had to face a lot of flak.

525
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,506
Get lost.

526
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,204
You know who I am, don't you?

527
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:15,955
Bloody rascal...

528
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,156
I've been looking all over for you.

529
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:29,964
Viju, don't...

530
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,234
Look at him...
threatening me with a gun.

531
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,605
Viju, the gun will go off!

532
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:37,840
He is only a child, let him go.

533
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,579
You want to shoot me?

534
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,913
Go ahead.

535
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,150
Shoot... what's wrong?

536
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,086
You will pay for this.

537
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,316
You will pay.

538
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,183
You want to shoot me...

539
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,192
you little prick!

540
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,966
Hey, this is not a toy gun.

541
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:07,906
Son, give me the gun. Give it to me.

542
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,074
Vijay, throw the gun away.

543
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,916
Throw the gun away.

544
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,202
Take a look, Lala bhai...

545
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,677
this is nice and fresh.

546
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,270
Let me see...

547
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,677
okay, cut it.

548
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,044
I want another one.

549
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,045
Look over there... Yusuf...

550
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,846
Woman trafficking
has gone up in Mumbai.

551
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,650
Additional commissioner, Mr. Gaitonde.
Are the Mumbai police sleeping?

552
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,849
Speak in turns.

553
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,425
Rauf Lala is connected
to almost every gang war.

554
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,230
Sir, don't you have
any evidence against him?

555
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,695
The police department is aware that...

556
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,364
...under the guise
of Alif Meat Export...

557
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,170
Rauf Lala smuggles
drugs and traffics women.

558
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,911
But he gets wind of our
action before we can make a move.

559
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,305
And if somebody dares to
give witness against him...

560
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,308
he doesn't survive.

561
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,344
This reflects the
failure of our system that...

562
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,012
a small time trader
has become the mafia...

563
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,024
...and rules over the
biggest slum in Asia.

564
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,193
By getting the unemployed...

565
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,263
...and the homeless to work
for his illegal activities...

566
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,797
Lala has provided them a job
and a roof over their head.

567
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,867
In return he has bought
their unflinching loyalty.

568
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,969
And they are willing to
lay down their life for him.

569
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,832
There is another name
connected to the gang wars.

570
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,030
Kancha.

571
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:20,007
The police has been successful
in keeping Kancha out from Mumbai.

572
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,078
So where does Kancha
run his operations from?

573
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,849
Across the coast to the south
west of Mumbai is an island.

574
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,476
Mandwa.

575
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,877
That is his empire.

576
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,251
He runs Mandwa like
Hitler's concentration camp.

577
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,415
Kancha is in Mandwa but...

578
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:39,986
his roots have penetrated the system
here a lot deeper than Rauf Lala.

579
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,429
Five years ago the Mumbai
police carried out a raid on Mandwa.

580
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,299
Scores of innocent
residents died in the cross firing.

581
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:52,364
And we had a tough time facing
the Human Rights Commission.

582
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,738
Kancha still harbors
an unfinished dream...

583
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,203
Mumbai.

584
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,972
But as long as I am alive,
I won't let him have it.

585
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,047
Who is Vijay?

586
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,418
Is this a joke, Gaitonde?

587
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,888
I'm sorry but this is his
only official photograph...

588
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,050
...in the police records.

589
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,318
Vijay Chauhan.

590
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,489
He has become a force to
reckon with in the last ten years.

591
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,522
He is Rauf Lala's right
hand and is very shrewd.

592
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,265
15 years ago, Rauf Lala had
bailed him out in connection...

593
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,066
...with the killing
of a sub-inspector.

594
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,532
That was my case.

595
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,106
Since then the police hasn't
found any evidence against him.

596
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,772
Getting someone to give witness
against him has become a joke.

597
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,251
Everything he earns goes
into a charitable trust.

598
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,248
The trust operates a
number of ambulances in Mumbai.

599
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,446
Vijay Chauhan...

600
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:39,981
He looks simple...

601
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,352
but is the most complicated of all.

602
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,315
At an age when he
should've been playing with toys...

603
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,827
...he learned to play
with guns and bullets.

604
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,888
It was as if he were at
war with law and order.

605
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,068
He leads a very low profile life...

606
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:57,332
and lives in a small
room in Dongri chawl.

607
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,545
Everything he earns, he gives away...

608
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,540
It's like he doesn't earn
money but earns people instead.

609
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,513
But his sights are set
on an unknown goal...

610
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,315
Something that only he knows.

611
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,547
Something that he wants to achieve...

612
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,150
at any cost.

613
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,671
Viju go for it!

614
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,367
Lift here...

615
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,532
A little higher... slowly...

616
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:13,567
How's it looking?!

617
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,070
Babban...

618
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,271
wait, wait...

619
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,439
like this...

620
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,182
You look just like Madhuri Dixit.

621
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,615
Yeah right!

622
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:33,255
Move it. Madhuri Dixit, right!

623
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,263
She is my darling Kaali.

624
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,999
You look so much like Silk Smita...

625
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,400
Silk Smita!

626
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,366
Oh my Kaali!

627
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,098
Why are you talking about her, Laxmi?

628
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,299
I'm happy to be Kaali.

629
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,467
Kaali Gawde.

630
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,635
Take a look at my staff.

631
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,343
Come on, stand in a line.

632
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,705
One... two... three... four.

633
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,447
Viju, over here!

634
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,210
They are imported.

635
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,054
Got them from Singapore...

636
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,213
pure Chinese!

637
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,088
What do they call you at home?

638
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,552
Chabeeli.
- Hey... she speaks Nepali!

639
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,292
Darn you! Shut up!

640
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,690
They live in Nepal, but
they are pure Chinese.

641
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,098
Say you are Chinese.

642
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,431
I am Chinese... but I live in Nepal.

643
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,629
See that?

644
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,102
Laughter channel,
let's have some claps.

645
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,404
Why are you here?

646
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,572
You have to cut the ribbon.

647
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,148
Ruby, clear this crowd.

648
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,341
Come on...

649
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,676
Here, take this.

650
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,753
- Lqbal bhai! -
You're late, lqbal bhai.

651
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,146
Okay, go in...

652
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,347
be careful of the ribbon.

653
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,659
The camera should
focus on me... a close-up.

654
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,056
Okay?

655
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,095
Let all of Dongri know that...

656
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,064
a Chinese Beauty Parlour should
be like Kaali's and no one else.

657
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,695
I should be all over cable TV.

658
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,497
I've taken the onus of
making Dongri beautiful.

659
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,673
You cut the ribbon!

660
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,633
I have yet to give my speech.

661
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,273
Rupees four thousand...

662
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,044
five hundred, sixty one.

663
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,346
First day collection.

664
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,357
And this is your share.

665
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,261
You helped me with the finance.

666
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,334
And no friendship in business.

667
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,537
What can I say, Viju...

668
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,236
I swear...

669
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,845
I've been dreaming
about this all my life.

670
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,410
To make others beautiful...

671
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,342
and look beautiful too.

672
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:39,313
I'll deck myself up in such a
way that people won't stop staring.

673
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:43,453
And they'll say, "Isn't that Kaali,
who owns the parlor?"

674
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,252
Tell me...

675
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,554
am I not shining bright?

676
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,731
So bright, I can feel it out here.

677
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,191
Groucho!

678
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,426
Oh, yes give me this.

679
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,206
What?

680
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:08,778
My wedding fund.

681
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,554
Only if I start saving now can I...

682
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,554
I mean there are so many things...

683
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,285
clothes, jewelry...

684
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,794
You've gone so quiet, it's as if
I got you in a Police encounter.

685
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,823
What's wrong?

686
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,560
Nothing.

687
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,605
I'm sorry, Viju.

688
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,176
Sorry.

689
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,384
I said too much.

690
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,552
I remember everything...

691
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,455
I understand everything.

692
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,462
You don't want to get married but...

693
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,696
what can I do?

694
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,700
Sometimes,
unknowingly I end up dreaming.

695
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:51,782
But don't worry about me.

696
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:55,816
I'm fine, just the way I am.

697
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:14,635
Hello, Viju sir.

698
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,675
Hello, Viju sir.
- Hello

699
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:24,445
You wanted to see me?

700
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,385
Yes, come in.

701
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,387
I'm retiring this year.

702
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,763
But I don't have to tell you
that I won't go away empty handed.

703
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,506
Yesterday there was
an encounter in Kurla.

704
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,998
We shot dead six.

705
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,712
Four from Shantaram's gang and...

706
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:50,871
two from Rauf Lala's.

707
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,312
How is mother?

708
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:56,710
Don't you know?

709
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:58,912
I know.

710
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,284
If you know then why...

711
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,051
Tomorrow Shiksha will turn 15.

712
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,555
And I'm still the same old Vijay...

713
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:12,966
who came to this city 15 years ago.

714
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,327
Along with your
mother and unborn sister.

715
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,303
Who then left you and went away.

716
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,571
Who don't live with you.

717
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,869
You look at them from afar and...

718
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:24,435
try to console yourself
that you also have a family.

719
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:28,675
But you still haven't worked
up the courage to meet them.

720
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,083
To gain something, you have
give something up, Gaitonde sir.

721
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,946
What do you want to achieve?

722
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,386
Tell me!

723
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:37,985
They are your family.

724
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,088
Don't you feel like meeting them?

725
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,827
Can I leave?

726
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,555
Shiksha, hurry up or you'll be late.

727
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:08,749
Yes, mother.

728
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,684
Come on...

729
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:23,767
Come on... hurry up. - Mother, I
think I'm forgetting something.

730
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,932
No, you are not.

731
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,508
I think I'm forgetting something.

732
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,975
No, you are not, now come on.

733
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:46,994
Mother I've forgotten my bottle.

734
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:48,789
There you are!

735
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,097
I've been waiting
since morning for this.

736
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,596
And finally it's here.

737
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:56,797
Who has sent this?

738
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,106
Who has sent this?

739
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,148
Who has sent this?

740
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,181
Tell me, please!

741
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,986
Who has sent this?

742
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,917
I... I don't know.

743
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,591
I just work at the store.

744
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,456
I don't know.

745
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,961
Mother, who sends
this for me every year?

746
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:29,900
Why are you here?

747
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:35,872
I don't want your world
to influence my daughter.

748
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,104
He was my father too!

749
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,909
How dare you take his name!

750
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,847
You think I'll forget
everything if I don't take his name?

751
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,043
What are you going to do?

752
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,643
You want another dead body?

753
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,016
Because of which you are
bent on making this world hell?

754
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,590
This world is hell, mother.

755
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:49,816
Without power...

756
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,524
If your father were alive...

757
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:52,754
But he isn't!

758
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,655
And it is such people who killed him.

759
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,831
They don't deserve to live.

760
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,798
They will have to die.

761
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,003
Will that bring your father back?

762
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,165
At least I will be
able to die in peace.

763
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:52,314
"Hum away."

764
00:55:54,284 --> 00:56:01,690
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

765
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:12,128
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

766
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:17,262
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

767
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:22,140
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

768
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:27,011
"Get rid of all the disappointments."

769
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:32,712
"Blow out the evening
candle and enjoy the night."

770
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:37,724
"You didn't learn
but I have taught you."

771
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:42,729
"The potent remedy
that I have tested."

772
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:47,700
"Just let go of all the
tears and pain and have a blast."

773
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:57,769
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

774
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:32,342
The burden you are carrying."

775
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:37,851
"Let me carry it and
lighten your burden."

776
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:43,151
"All the pain that
leaves you sleepless."

777
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:48,356
"Go throw all of them in the fire."

778
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:53,293
"There is more of
sorrow in your life."

779
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:58,372
"We'll bribe and get an
extra dose of happiness."

780
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:03,445
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

781
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:11,050
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

782
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:48,322
"When you make a long face,
even the sun begins to set."

783
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:53,293
"When you smile, the moon
starts to illuminate radiantly."

784
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:59,057
"When you are silent,
life seems unmelodious."

785
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:04,231
"When you talk, it's
like music to my ears."

786
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,277
"Why are you holding it all inside?"

787
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:17,046
"Come on. Pour your heart
out to me. Hum away. Hum away."

788
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:24,457
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

789
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,859
"Hum away."Hum away. Hum this
song." Where is he going? Viju.

790
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:34,136
"I'll let my hair down and enjoy."

791
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:39,875
"I'll borrow some peace from you."

792
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:44,571
"I've learnt what you've taught me."

793
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:49,576
"I too have tried that potent remedy."

794
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:54,822
"I have let go of all the
tears and pain and had a blast."

795
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:59,861
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

796
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:04,990
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

797
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:15,032
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

798
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:25,110
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

799
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,555
According to unidentified sources...

800
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:35,596
Rauf Lala carried out these
attacks because a drug deal fell apart.

801
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,601
Sir, what information does the
police have about these killings?

802
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,395
Their names are Karthik and Ramesh.

803
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:43,597
They work for Shantaram...

804
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,300
who actually looks after
Kancha's business in Mumbai.

805
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,772
The very same Kancha who has
challenged Rauf Lala and...

806
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,376
wants to control the
drug market in Mumbai.

807
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,677
Home Secretary Borkar,
when will Kancha be arrested?

808
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,547
Now, listen to me, you are
moving away from the main point.

809
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:00,113
Right now, Kancha isn't our target.

810
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,281
Rauf Lala is.

811
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,449
Rauf Lala who conducts
the drugs business...

812
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,356
...behind a cloak of
public activities.

813
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,289
We have to rid this evil
called drugs from our society.

814
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,433
Sooner or later, we will do it.

815
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:12,659
Get him to stop.

816
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,167
Nothing... nothing Azhar

817
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,362
Idiot!

818
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,469
Borkar, that bastard!

819
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,039
Kancha's slave.

820
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,203
Nothing's wrong, I'll be right back.

821
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,679
Salaam, Lala bhai.

822
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,581
Everything alright, Tony?

823
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,086
Alright?

824
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,357
How many years have we
been doing business together?

825
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,552
What's the matter?

826
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,393
For the first time, we are
going back empty handed.

827
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,094
Your little boy over here
is quoting sky high prices.

828
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,670
You won't get this
quality anywhere in Mumbai!

829
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,700
And you will have to pay a price.

830
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,103
Take it easy, Mazhar.

831
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,641
You take it easy!

832
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,407
Don't talk to me like that!

833
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,439
The price remains the same.

834
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:00,807
Alright, Lala bhai.

835
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:03,479
We'll see you after the 20th.

836
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,081
Father, these bastards...

837
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,352
You don't do drugs
while conducting a deal.

838
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:14,554
Never!

839
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,255
Once that's over you
can do hash or cocaine...

840
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:18,424
I don't care.

841
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,270
We lost this deal.

842
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,240
Father, I know for a fact that...

843
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,707
Tony has already made a deal for the
cocaine he wants to get from us...

844
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,575
and now he doesn't have the cocaine.

845
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:33,373
So?

846
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:36,444
He said the 20th...

847
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,616
which means he will
get the cocaine by then.

848
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:41,748
He isn't buying from us.

849
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,259
So then, who else can give
him cheap cocaine in Mumbai?

850
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,522
Maybe an outsider...

851
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,392
Kancha.

852
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:54,261
That means Mandwa.

853
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:58,903
100 percent pure cocaine
and a lot cheaper than us.

854
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,769
Gaitonde has covered
every nook and corner.

855
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,743
He won't let Kancha's
stuff land in Mumbai.

856
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,144
I'm sure there's a place.

857
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,684
I know someone who can tell us.

858
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:13,913
See you later.

859
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:22,424
What are you doing?

860
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,227
What are you doing?

861
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,698
Save me!

862
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,230
I'll fall.

863
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:35,510
Remember anything?
- I can't hear you.

864
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,738
Are you trying to kill me?

865
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,339
Do you remember?

866
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,313
I don't know anything.

867
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:47,254
Who will look after my Pappu?

868
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:52,918
What will happen to my Pappu?

869
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,287
Now do you remember?

870
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,263
Trust me, I don't know anything.

871
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,768
I am done for.

872
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,796
Help me...

873
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,703
Are you trying to kill me?

874
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,537
Wait!

875
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,735
I'll tell you.

876
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,743
Where is Kancha's stuff landing?

877
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:19,616
At Home Secretary
Borkar's home in Goa.

878
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,254
Don't ask me who I am, Gaitonde sir...

879
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,667
but I have news you could use.

880
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,566
Everything good at the factory?

881
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,399
Borkar sir, all good, thanks to you.

882
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,770
You don't need to thank me.

883
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,242
I'm only a public servant.

884
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,438
I'll be right back.

885
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,013
Where's the torch?

886
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,483
Go away from here, quick!

887
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,742
Hey! Inspector!

888
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,339
Hurry up. Hurry up.

889
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,731
Isn't this a lot?

890
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,657
Borkar...

891
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:45,869
you won't get a better opportunity
to prove your loyalty to Kancha.

892
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,200
Come on.

893
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,244
Come on quick!

894
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,208
Hurry up!

895
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,114
If you could help me
with a few bottles of feni.

896
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,277
I have to go all the
way back to Mumbai.

897
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:01,881
You want me to call Kancha?

898
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,356
Okay, okay... Borkar.

899
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,140
It really is very hot today.

900
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:40,724
You...

901
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,055
What are you doing here?

902
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,297
I'm here as a guest.

903
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:46,766
Where's your hospitality?

904
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:48,761
I'll show you...

905
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,271
Don't waste time. Gaitonde
will be here any minute...

906
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,371
with his entire force.

907
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,343
Gaitonde?

908
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:06,779
What's he doing here?

909
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,358
The Home Secretary of Maharashtra
is having a ball of a time in Goa!

910
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,891
You like to party in style, Borkar...

911
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:19,397
Music, dance, booze...

912
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:21,828
and cocaine!

913
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,029
What...

914
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:24,197
what are you talking about?

915
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,039
Shantaram has left and...

916
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,376
Gaitonde is outside.

917
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,076
He will come in any minute now.

918
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:45,220
Here he gets his
hands on the cocaine...

919
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,854
...and there your
Government collapses.

920
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,161
What... what do you want?

921
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,334
Now listen...

922
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:03,402
carefully.

923
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,982
Gaitonde...

924
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,894
what is the meaning of this?

925
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,087
There's cocaine here, sir.

926
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,128
We have information.

927
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,323
Cocaine?

928
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,525
Have you lost it?

929
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,233
You do know you could lose yourjob.

930
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,769
That's precisely why I'm
here with a search warrant.

931
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:30,930
I got it over night.

932
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,132
Guess you weren't informed.

933
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,335
Come on.

934
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,913
Open it!
- No, no...

935
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,958
there's just some old stuff in here.

936
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,119
Actually... actually... some of
my personal things are here.

937
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:54,320
I said open it!

938
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,331
There's nothing here.

939
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:03,833
Happy?

940
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:08,142
You've crossed your
limit this time, Gaitonde.

941
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,208
I'm the Home Secretary of Maharashtra.

942
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,177
You got a search warrant for my house?

943
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:16,080
I'm going to get you fired
or else I'll change my name.

944
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,349
He's going to kill me...

945
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,218
Kancha is going to kill me.

946
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,087
I have to do something...

947
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,926
or Kancha is going to kill me!

948
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,392
I got it.

949
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,062
I'll kill Gaitonde.

950
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,397
Have you lost it?

951
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,269
If you kill Gaitonde...

952
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,003
the entire police
force will be on your tail.

953
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,080
His record is so clean,
even I won't be able to help.

954
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,377
If you want to kill someone...

955
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:52,979
kill Vijay.

956
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,119
Hello.

957
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:01,924
You remind me of my father.

958
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,091
He would say...

959
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,569
"The weak can't say that they
have forgiven the powerful."

960
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,271
"For that, the weak must
themselves become powerful."

961
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:21,144
Today begins my
crusade to become powerful.

962
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,111
What are you trying to say?

963
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:25,345
Hello...

964
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:27,346
Hello... Vijay?

965
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,683
Let me go...

966
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,498
Let me go...

967
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,070
The more you suffer...

968
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,706
the closer will your death be.

969
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,199
Let me go...

970
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,008
I'll die!

971
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,341
Let me go...

972
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,672
You let me live...
- Leave me.

973
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,374
And I'll let you go!

974
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,575
Let me go.

975
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,419
There, I let you go.

976
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,060
Now, ask why.

977
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,256
No.

978
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,097
Ask!

979
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,428
W... Why?

980
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,096
Because I don't want
Rauf Lala's charity.

981
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,671
I want all of Mumbai.

982
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:30,637
And, you can help me with that...

983
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:33,442
you and your Kancha.

984
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,451
Be prepared to prove
your loyalty to me...

985
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,587
I've spared your life.

986
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,162
And tell Kancha that...

987
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:52,525
a year later, stuff from Mandwa
will be sold throughout Mumbai!

988
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,568
We'll decide on the profit,
when we meet.

989
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,233
Agreed?

990
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,306
I suggest you drink less.

991
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:14,382
By defeating Kancha, Vijay has
once again upheld my position.

992
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,550
And so, this gathering here is
witness to my proclamation that...

993
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,753
from today you can ask
me for anything, anytime.

994
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,394
I present you with the
territories of Bakri Adda and Dongri...

995
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,134
and I announce that...

996
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,830
from now on the people pledge
their loyalty and support to you.

997
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:33,070
May Allah bless you with
strength to defend it.

998
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,075
So be it!

999
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:38,203
So be it!

1000
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,508
So be it!

1001
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,550
There's yet another reason to rejoice.

1002
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,278
I've decided that...

1003
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,687
my son, Mazhar will wed Mr.
Qureshi's daughter Saayra.

1004
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:50,850
Congratulations!

1005
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,526
The ceremony will be held
on the 3rd of next month.

1006
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,286
There will be a feast.
- Congratulations!

1007
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,228
Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

1008
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:58,591
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1009
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,346
Father...
- Yes?

1010
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,814
Those areas were rightfully mine!

1011
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:16,643
So?

1012
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:18,816
I should've got those.

1013
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,479
And you will get them.

1014
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,150
But you need to
control your addiction.

1015
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:25,685
What do you mean?

1016
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,421
Do you see that crowd?

1017
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,422
He has earned it.

1018
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:30,824
With his own hands.

1019
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,592
So, it belongs to him.

1020
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:34,528
You are mine.

1021
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:35,795
My own blood.

1022
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,364
So, you belong to me.

1023
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:39,465
I still don't get it.

1024
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,539
Let him rule.

1025
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:43,370
The throne belongs to you.

1026
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,439
When you feel the time is right...

1027
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,176
take over it.

1028
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:50,777
What about Vijay?

1029
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:55,617
Who can tell what will happen next...

1030
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:00,556
whether Vijay will live or die...

1031
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,661
Lala bhai, your shoes.

1032
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,603
Whose shoes are these?

1033
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:13,832
These aren't mine...

1034
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:21,841
Vijay!

1035
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:33,385
Yes, father?

1036
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:37,192
Son, I think you wore
my shoes unknowingly.

1037
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,266
I'm really sorry, they looked the same.
- No. It's okay. - So I messed up.

1038
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,429
How could you not?!

1039
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:46,499
Mazhar!

1040
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,637
Hey! Vijay!

1041
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:56,215
Catch him. Vijay. Come on.

1042
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,377
Get the car. Hurry up.

1043
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,483
My dear, be strong.

1044
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,451
Allah is great.

1045
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,559
Boss. Boss.
- Out of the way!

1046
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,225
Move. Move.

1047
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:16,797
Please wait here.

1048
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,668
Please move out of the way.

1049
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:19,900
Doctor...

1050
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:21,966
he is the reason I'm still alive!

1051
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,540
When you bring him out,
I want him alive!

1052
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:25,905
What's his condition?

1053
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,572
He's alive, sir. He will survive.

1054
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:28,943
Any information? About the shooter?

1055
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:30,610
Nothing, sir.

1056
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,645
But there's something you should know.

1057
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,748
What is it, Doctor?

1058
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:37,722
You are still over here?
Please wait over there.

1059
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,987
He is our patient. Let us do our work.

1060
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,592
Who do you think you're talking to?

1061
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:43,858
He is talking to you.

1062
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:46,829
To all of you!

1063
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,430
I want this corridor
to be cleared right now!

1064
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,568
You think there's a circus here?

1065
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:55,568
Take it easy.

1066
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,332
Doctor, how's he doing now?

1067
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:21,627
He is better now.

1068
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:27,935
Doctor, give me a minute.

1069
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:29,469
Okay.

1070
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:35,709
What are you trying to do?

1071
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,416
What do you mean?

1072
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,612
Let me explain...

1073
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,548
You were shot with a.22 bore.

1074
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:46,323
Shot from an ordinary
gun from the front...

1075
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,460
that too on the shoulder!

1076
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,522
What are you getting at?

1077
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,624
Assasins don't use a.22 bore weapon.

1078
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,561
Especially...

1079
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,502
when their target is Vijay Chauhan!

1080
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,332
Their target was Mazhar.

1081
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,479
That thought can impress Rauf Lala.

1082
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,638
Not me.

1083
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,545
You weren't shot at.
You've been kept alive.

1084
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,114
And the questions is... why?

1085
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:16,448
Gaitonde sir, I don't
understand what you're trying to say.

1086
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,051
We got an empty whiskey
bottle from that building.

1087
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,655
We have taken the fingerprints and...

1088
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,630
it will take us no longer than a
week to identify the fingerprints.

1089
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,602
Make the most of this time.

1090
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,738
Hey... what about my sherwani?

1091
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:42,975
Where is my sherwani?

1092
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,143
I got it made myself.

1093
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:45,545
You'll look like a star.

1094
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:46,712
A hero!

1095
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,113
Right?

1096
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,382
You're the hero, in my eyes.

1097
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:52,985
Trust me...

1098
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,889
I'm indebted to you, brother.

1099
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:59,094
Now, I don't have two but three sons.

1100
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:03,764
And together you
will rule over Mumbai.

1101
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,499
Okay? - Sure.

1102
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,837
But one of us is to
be sacrificed today.

1103
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,541
Of course!

1104
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:11,571
The groom!

1105
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:14,847
Lala bhai, the guests have arrived.

1106
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,042
They are asking for you.

1107
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,486
Okay... tell Yusuf
to get the car ready.

1108
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:21,914
Vijay, get Mazhar
dressed and bring him.

1109
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,581
I'll take Azhar along. Come on.

1110
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,194
And don't be late. The
guests have arrived.

1111
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:31,760
See how good it will look on you.

1112
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,193
Bhai, the next sherwani will be yours!

1113
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:39,899
Mazhar bhai, call for you.

1114
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,033
He won't take any
calls today. You answer it.

1115
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:43,873
He has the information.
About the shooter.

1116
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,037
What?

1117
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,444
He says... he'll only talk to you.

1118
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:47,981
Well then, give me the phone.

1119
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:52,612
Yes?

1120
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,692
Bastard!

1121
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:08,499
Mazhar!

1122
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,904
Shantaram shot you that day.

1123
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,997
On Kancha's orders.
- Shantaram?

1124
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:15,906
Yes! The bastard is alone
at his factory right now.

1125
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:17,802
Mazhar, wait. I'll go.

1126
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:20,473
I won't get married
until I shoot him dead.

1127
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:21,708
It's your wedding today, Mazhar!

1128
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:22,909
I swear on Allah...

1129
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:25,881
until I see his body,
I won't get married.

1130
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,079
Mazhar!

1131
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:06,060
"You have the magnificence and
grandness that befits an emperor."

1132
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:10,154
"You have the magnificence and
grandness that befits an emperor."

1133
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:14,929
"You are the chosen one."

1134
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:19,166
"You are the chosen one."

1135
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:23,802
"You can turn mud into
gold with a mere touch."

1136
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:28,008
"The enemy stands no chance
when you wield your sword."

1137
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:32,610
"God has bestowed you with His grace."

1138
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:37,021
"Even the angels bow down to you."

1139
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:41,289
"You are the messiah and the savior."

1140
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:45,930
"Whatever you saw becomes the law."

1141
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,770
Come. Get in.

1142
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:53,671
Bastard!

1143
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,711
Bastard!

1144
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:05,749
Let's get out of here.

1145
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:33,771
"The heavenly sight is
before your eyes today."

1146
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:38,080
"The apple of your eye is
your shadow. Your reflection."

1147
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:42,714
"Everyone has
blessings for him today."

1148
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:47,056
"He is the successor to
the throne of your kingdom."

1149
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,634
"May ever loss be
slower than your victory."

1150
01:22:56,738 --> 01:23:01,072
"Destiny is nothing but a toy to you."

1151
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:05,704
"The enemy stands no chance
when you wield your sword."

1152
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:09,944
"You are the messiah and the savior."

1153
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:14,283
"Even the angels bow down to you."

1154
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:18,826
"You are the messiah and the savior."

1155
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:23,864
"Whatever you saw becomes
the law. Glory to Allah."

1156
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:59,194
"No common man is common."

1157
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,861
"And no one's a king."

1158
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:06,435
"I am the emperor..."

1159
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:10,168
"...only because you've
accepted me as your king."

1160
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:21,915
"No common man is common."

1161
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:25,487
"And no one's a king."

1162
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:47,811
Brother...

1163
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,912
brother, the gun...

1164
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,099
Bastard!

1165
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,938
Son of a bitch!

1166
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,545
Father called you his 'Son' today.

1167
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,011
My suspicion was right.

1168
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,822
You had your sights
on father's empire.

1169
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,952
Shoot me...

1170
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:37,428
Shoot me or I will kill you!

1171
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:38,794
Shoot!

1172
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:39,992
Shoot me...

1173
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,011
He's gone!

1174
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,910
"Stick those strong shoulders out."

1175
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,848
"They are God's own children."

1176
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,818
"The lines on their palms..."

1177
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:02,515
"...are the maps of your worlds."

1178
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,115
"Life takes a new
course at every step."

1179
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,126
"This is what I believe."

1180
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:08,991
"Those two mean the world to me."

1181
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,190
"Stick those strong shoulders out."

1182
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:15,827
"They are God's own children."

1183
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:19,029
"The lines on their palms..."

1184
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:22,132
"...are the maps of your worlds."

1185
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:27,004
The first pillar of Rauf
Lala's empire has collapsed.

1186
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:35,287
Hey...

1187
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:37,490
what are you doing?

1188
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:45,031
Leaving an empty
bottle at a crime scene...

1189
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:47,559
is even worse.

1190
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:49,102
What do you mean?

1191
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,262
I mean...

1192
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:55,167
I don't need Rauf
Lala to get to Kancha...

1193
01:26:56,978 --> 01:26:58,070
and now...

1194
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,006
not even you.

1195
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:06,451
"Glory to Allah! Glory to Allah!"

1196
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:09,182
"Glory to Allah! Glory to Allah!"

1197
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:34,132
Shantaram was Kancha's
right-hand man, sir.

1198
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:35,334
My question is...

1199
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,343
with Kancha running
his empire in Mandwa...

1200
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,413
doesn't the Mumbai
police have any power to...

1201
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:44,315
I believe, Home Secretary Borkar
is better equipped to answer that.

1202
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,486
Once we have his orders...

1203
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,554
we will attack Mandwa.

1204
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:51,021
Listen...

1205
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:54,489
for some reason, the permission
hasn't been given all this while...

1206
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:57,587
The last time police attacked Mandwa,
some innocent civilians were...

1207
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,564
Just for the sake of a
few civilian lives...

1208
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,192
we cannot put the whole
of Mumbai in jeopardy.

1209
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:04,228
I want your permission.

1210
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:08,407
I promise, I will give the
permission on a priority basis.

1211
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,374
We want results, not empty promises!

1212
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,105
Listen...
- We don't want to listen.

1213
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:13,271
Mr. Gaitonde...

1214
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:15,379
we want you to
comment on this, please.

1215
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:17,277
Well, we have some leads...

1216
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:20,684
and it seems that due
to these gang wars...

1217
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,747
the underworld is shaken up.

1218
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,556
As we speak Rauf Lala is in the ICCU.

1219
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:25,717
Can we expect that...

1220
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,688
Lala's rule of terror is over now?

1221
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,628
Who do you think is next
in line to be the heir?

1222
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:34,259
Considering Rauf Lala's son,
Azhar's mental health...

1223
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,098
there is only one obvious choice...

1224
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:38,163
Vijay Chauhan!

1225
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,237
I guess you've heard my name...

1226
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:23,206
Kancha.

1227
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:32,577
I have.

1228
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:34,416
I'm sure you've also heard...

1229
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,888
What did you get with you
and what will you take back.

1230
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:41,759
Impressive, my
reputation precedes me...

1231
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:45,358
So, what will you take back?

1232
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:48,493
I shall give...

1233
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:50,629
something...

1234
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:52,263
to you.

1235
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:53,465
What do you mean?

1236
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,435
We'll talk when we meet.

1237
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:58,304
Well, I can't come to Mumbai.

1238
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:01,906
I'll come to Mandwa.

1239
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:04,441
Even after you killed Shantaram?

1240
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:07,350
You don't need minnows
in the long run, Kancha.

1241
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:10,650
Very true... Very true.

1242
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:12,818
Come then...

1243
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:16,388
we'll prepare ourselves to honour you.

1244
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,523
Mandwa awaits you.

1245
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:41,513
Surya...

1246
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:44,323
Vijay Chauhan is coming to Mandwa.

1247
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:45,717
Really?

1248
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,785
After having killed Shantaram?

1249
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:51,465
Shantaram's are meant to die.

1250
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,298
What do you mean?

1251
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,763
Vijay could've worked
out a deal on the phone.

1252
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,732
Why would he want to
come here for that?

1253
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:05,311
That's what I'm asking, Kancha sir.

1254
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,548
You asking amounts to nothing...

1255
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:18,356
you good-for-nothing.

1256
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,663
It's I who should ask.

1257
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:25,293
Right?

1258
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:29,566
It's I who should ask...

1259
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:36,504
It's I who should ask...

1260
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:24,448
There was a school there...

1261
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,353
and a master as well.

1262
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:30,548
Master...

1263
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:32,617
Bindiya!

1264
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:33,952
Bindya what happened?

1265
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:36,426
Why are you still there?

1266
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:37,690
Get your mother, quick!

1267
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,370
Kancha is waiting...

1268
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,498
let's go.

1269
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,496
Vijay!

1270
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:35,714
Viju!

1271
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:45,929
That is the Master's house.

1272
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:50,900
His son broke my nose.

1273
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:53,034
So I burnt down his house.

1274
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:54,771
Tit for tat.

1275
01:36:57,578 --> 01:36:59,944
I set fire to the house.

1276
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,979
Kancha is waiting...

1277
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,078
Let's go...

1278
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:24,101
He doesn't deserve to live!

1279
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:26,230
He is the scum of our village... Scum!

1280
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:29,839
Master! Your ghost
will hang from the tree...

1281
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:32,805
Mandva has been rid of a monster.

1282
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:42,821
Nobody will give wood for his pyre.

1283
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:47,083
He won't even find a place in hell!

1284
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:51,089
Master, you won't
even have a cremation!

1285
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:52,927
Let him rot.

1286
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:55,593
A man like him should be
treated like this only!

1287
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:22,653
Kancha sir!

1288
01:39:09,076 --> 01:39:10,566
Father!

1289
01:39:14,982 --> 01:39:16,779
Father!

1290
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:41,961
Silky siren. Silky siren!

1291
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:03,288
"My eyes are so full of venom."

1292
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:07,119
"My wink kills.
Darn this dainty waist of mine."

1293
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:09,195
"Can kill a millions with a jerk."

1294
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:19,837
"My eyes are so full of venom."

1295
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:22,841
"My wink kills.
Darn this dainty waist of mine."

1296
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:24,911
"Can kill a millions with a jerk."

1297
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:30,012
"Have come here for change
for thousands of rupees."

1298
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:35,284
"Have come to light cigarettes and
cigars with the fire of my body."

1299
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:38,552
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1300
01:41:38,859 --> 01:41:40,884
"After downing a peg or two."

1301
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:43,963
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1302
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,259
"After downing a peg or two."

1303
01:41:46,366 --> 01:41:49,233
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1304
01:41:49,336 --> 01:41:51,531
"After downing a peg or two."

1305
01:41:51,638 --> 01:41:54,471
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1306
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:57,169
"After downing a peg or two."

1307
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,923
You remind me of someone...

1308
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:15,553
Who?

1309
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:17,027
I can't tell...

1310
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:18,888
but you definitely
remind me of someone.

1311
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:23,960
Why did you kill Mazhar?

1312
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:27,367
Shantaram killed Mazhar.

1313
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:31,307
And, why did you kill Shantaram?

1314
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,307
To get in touch with you.

1315
01:42:35,249 --> 01:42:36,409
And if I were to kill you...

1316
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:38,109
right now? Then?

1317
01:42:38,619 --> 01:42:40,109
Then you'll never get Mumbai.

1318
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:42,554
You carry Mumbai in your pockets?

1319
01:42:47,394 --> 01:42:48,486
No, in my shoes.

1320
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:13,645
"I'll go crazy in the jungle today."

1321
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:16,218
"I'll play with hungry lions."

1322
01:43:16,323 --> 01:43:19,087
"I'll carry burning coal..."

1323
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,922
"...on my butter like palms."

1324
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:24,393
"I am the fish of the
deep waters, darling."

1325
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:26,966
"I have roamed
different sea and shores."

1326
01:43:27,067 --> 01:43:31,470
"I have lost to your stare today."

1327
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:34,606
"My charisma kills."

1328
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:37,272
"But it appears to be sweet."

1329
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:39,136
"My charisma kills."

1330
01:43:39,246 --> 01:43:40,372
"But it appears to be sweet."

1331
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,142
"I'll serve it for you
with love. Come, get it.

1332
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,309
"This is just a trailer."

1333
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:48,013
"I have come to show
the entire movie."

1334
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:53,125
"Have come to light cigarettes and
cigars with the fire of my body."

1335
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:56,458
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1336
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:58,531
"After downing a peg or two."

1337
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:01,692
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1338
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:04,061
"After downing a peg or two."

1339
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:07,163
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1340
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:09,299
"After downing a peg or two."

1341
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:12,435
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1342
01:44:12,546 --> 01:44:16,414
"After downing a peg or two."

1343
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:47,175
"Fun has come visiting
this barren neighborhood."

1344
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,545
"So very interesting is your face."

1345
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:52,346
"Your colors have
colored my intentions."

1346
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:54,352
"It is deep and will not fade away."

1347
01:44:55,188 --> 01:44:57,713
"My beauty is like the butter knife."

1348
01:44:57,824 --> 01:45:00,224
"Cuts through all the curtains."

1349
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:03,228
"My nights are Ionely."

1350
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:05,059
"I will share them with you."

1351
01:45:05,265 --> 01:45:08,098
"My words are a signal."

1352
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:10,770
"In them lies the game."

1353
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,767
"My words are a signal.
In them lies the game."

1354
01:45:14,074 --> 01:45:16,508
"Break open the
treasure and plunder it."

1355
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:21,411
"I have come to heal your
wounds by kissing them."

1356
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:26,651
"Have come to light cigarettes and
cigars with the fire of my body."

1357
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:30,211
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1358
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,121
"After downing a peg or two."

1359
01:45:32,225 --> 01:45:33,385
"Here comes the silky siren."

1360
01:45:36,563 --> 01:45:40,522
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1361
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:42,625
"After downing a peg or two."

1362
01:45:42,736 --> 01:45:45,762
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1363
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:48,466
"After downing a peg or two."

1364
01:45:49,409 --> 01:45:51,673
A nobody from the
chawls of Dongri is here...

1365
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:58,577
to sell Mumbai to me.

1366
01:46:02,723 --> 01:46:04,588
There must be
something you want in return.

1367
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:09,687
What?

1368
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:14,792
Mandwa.

1369
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:19,439
You've asked Ravan for his Lanka.

1370
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:35,546
Wait!

1371
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:46,591
If you had asked for anything else...

1372
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:51,137
you would find how generous Kancha is.

1373
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:56,301
Come on.

1374
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:08,312
Come on.

1375
01:47:18,532 --> 01:47:20,432
If you are through
with the welcome parade...

1376
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:22,628
can we get down to business?

1377
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,296
There's definitely
something about you.

1378
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:30,603
You know I can't kill you.

1379
01:47:31,578 --> 01:47:33,375
At least not now.

1380
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:36,439
No weaknesses...

1381
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:38,581
no troubles...

1382
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:43,184
No relationships
tugging at the heart...

1383
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:49,226
finally I get who you remind me of...

1384
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:52,691
Myself.

1385
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:56,361
Then it's agreed.

1386
01:47:57,437 --> 01:47:58,734
Mumbai is mine.

1387
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,931
Because Rauf Lala isn't there.

1388
01:48:03,276 --> 01:48:04,641
His empire is no more.

1389
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:06,739
Who is still there?

1390
01:48:08,682 --> 01:48:10,206
Oh yes, Gaitonde.

1391
01:48:11,785 --> 01:48:13,946
I want Gaitonde dead.

1392
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:20,225
And I'll give Mandwa to you as a gift.

1393
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,385
Kancha sir...

1394
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:30,900
The deal is done, Vijay.

1395
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:32,266
Congratulations!

1396
01:48:32,372 --> 01:48:33,430
Congratulations, Vijay!

1397
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:37,935
Deal is final.

1398
01:48:38,044 --> 01:48:40,342
Surya, our deal is done.

1399
01:48:51,324 --> 01:48:52,655
We have a deal, Vijay.

1400
01:48:54,561 --> 01:48:55,687
Congratulations!

1401
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:59,262
Take this away!

1402
01:48:59,432 --> 01:49:00,797
Lala isn't cripple!

1403
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:02,425
Greetings Lala bhai...

1404
01:49:03,336 --> 01:49:04,462
Lala bhai...

1405
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:07,465
the night Mazhar was shot
another body was found there.

1406
01:49:08,008 --> 01:49:09,373
Shantaram's.

1407
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:14,379
Where is that bastard Vijay?

1408
01:49:15,015 --> 01:49:16,915
He's gone to Mandwa to meet Kancha.

1409
01:49:31,698 --> 01:49:36,294
Falling into such deep sleep
can be injurious to health.

1410
01:49:37,971 --> 01:49:39,871
You didn't tell me
that you have a sister.

1411
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,437
Your father has
regained consciousness.

1412
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:52,512
Lathi charge!

1413
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:56,052
It's an emergency, sir.

1414
01:49:56,356 --> 01:49:57,516
I need the orders.

1415
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:02,588
I will need to call for a
cabinet meeting, it will take time.

1416
01:50:02,696 --> 01:50:03,822
You calm down Gaitonde...

1417
01:50:06,866 --> 01:50:09,596
Sir, more than two thousand
people are gathered there...

1418
01:50:09,703 --> 01:50:11,000
to watch the girl being sold.

1419
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:13,504
I need your permission to open fire...

1420
01:50:15,075 --> 01:50:16,337
sir...

1421
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:17,501
Viju bhai...

1422
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:18,976
Rauf Lala has taken
Shiksha to Imamwada.

1423
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:20,546
Even the Police can't get through.

1424
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:23,774
Where is Laxmi?

1425
01:50:25,352 --> 01:50:26,410
Let you go?

1426
01:50:26,519 --> 01:50:28,043
I'll display you before the market.

1427
01:50:28,355 --> 01:50:29,447
Stand up!

1428
01:50:29,556 --> 01:50:32,389
Only then will my
son's soul rest in peace.

1429
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:35,825
Vijay, help. - That Vijay
will beg and plead before me!

1430
01:50:38,098 --> 01:50:40,396
Leave me!

1431
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:43,628
Stand here!

1432
01:50:43,737 --> 01:50:44,795
Gentlemen!

1433
01:50:44,904 --> 01:50:46,804
This is the finest quality!

1434
01:50:46,906 --> 01:50:49,101
Leave me!
- And I demand a price to match.

1435
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:51,377
Gorgeous face...

1436
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:52,945
Complete in every way.

1437
01:50:53,046 --> 01:50:56,106
Uncle...
- May I have the bids, gentlemen!

1438
01:51:12,098 --> 01:51:14,828
Lala bhai... one hundred thousand.

1439
01:51:14,934 --> 01:51:17,562
Two hundred thousand!

1440
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,798
Gentlemen, this stuff
deserves more than that!

1441
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,835
Look at her glow...

1442
01:51:21,941 --> 01:51:23,966
Look at her color. Look at
the radiance she exudes.

1443
01:51:24,077 --> 01:51:26,375
And innocence demands a price!

1444
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:53,931
Lala bhai, five hundred thousand.

1445
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:55,098
Five hundred thousand!

1446
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,470
Five hundred thousand!

1447
01:51:56,576 --> 01:51:58,168
Now that's something!
Five hundred thousand!

1448
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:00,072
Five hundred thousand, going once...

1449
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:03,448
Going twice...
- No.

1450
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:08,621
Going thrice.

1451
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:17,530
No. Leave me.
- Lala fell for your ugly face!

1452
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:19,825
I'm sure you won't
even leave the bones.

1453
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:21,558
Come, take your winning!

1454
01:52:21,868 --> 01:52:23,028
Here...

1455
01:52:23,203 --> 01:52:24,465
Shut up!

1456
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:25,629
Stand here!

1457
01:52:26,272 --> 01:52:28,001
Amazing Lala bhai...

1458
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:30,133
No, please, let me go!

1459
01:52:30,243 --> 01:52:33,701
This time you've got
something exceptional.

1460
01:52:33,813 --> 01:52:35,974
Enjoy! Have fun!

1461
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:47,184
No.

1462
01:52:50,163 --> 01:52:51,494
Khalid, fire!

1463
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:11,144
Let me go, please!

1464
01:53:11,985 --> 01:53:13,213
Please, leave me.

1465
01:53:13,753 --> 01:53:17,655
No, brother! Let me go...

1466
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:26,155
Please, leave me.

1467
01:53:28,668 --> 01:53:30,636
Father!

1468
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:37,202
Don't call me father, you bastard!

1469
01:53:38,945 --> 01:53:40,173
Lala is my name!

1470
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,142
Rauf Lala.

1471
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:47,613
And Rauf Lala never leaves the
market without selling the girl.

1472
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:50,719
Let the bidding start again!

1473
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:57,787
I said, step back.

1474
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:00,030
Come on, step back.

1475
01:54:09,075 --> 01:54:10,702
Bloody son of a bitch...

1476
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:13,244
you'll never forget that...

1477
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:18,140
for a moment I made
you go through hell.

1478
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:19,741
Give my girl back!

1479
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:57,752
Worthless... traitor!

1480
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:24,240
An object like this
doesn't Hit the market everyday.

1481
01:55:24,951 --> 01:55:26,816
If I squeeze her...

1482
01:55:27,253 --> 01:55:29,983
a sweet scent will ooze out from her.

1483
01:55:30,356 --> 01:55:32,847
Sweet scent will ooze out.

1484
01:55:33,259 --> 01:55:38,253
Dear. I'll make a
scent out of this girl.

1485
01:55:56,382 --> 01:55:57,508
Vijay...

1486
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:00,351
Vijay, let him go.

1487
01:56:00,453 --> 01:56:04,014
If I weren't mourning for my son...

1488
01:56:04,891 --> 01:56:07,291
I swear, I would have
taken her to bed myself.

1489
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:14,425
Vijay...

1490
01:56:15,368 --> 01:56:17,268
Mother!

1491
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:19,802
Vijay, stop!

1492
01:56:23,142 --> 01:56:24,200
Mother!

1493
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:25,368
Shiksha!

1494
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,109
Vijay, let him go!

1495
01:56:31,317 --> 01:56:32,841
Vijay, don't!

1496
01:56:32,952 --> 01:56:34,180
Mother, how do you know him?

1497
01:56:34,287 --> 01:56:35,549
Vijay, let him go!

1498
01:56:36,889 --> 01:56:37,947
Mother, who is he?

1499
01:56:38,057 --> 01:56:39,115
Vijay, let him go!

1500
01:56:39,225 --> 01:56:40,317
Mother...

1501
01:56:53,506 --> 01:56:54,905
Mother, who is he?

1502
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:56,976
Tell me. Why don't you say something?

1503
01:56:57,076 --> 01:56:59,476
Mother, who is he? Tell me.

1504
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:02,207
Mother... Answer me!
- He is your brother!

1505
01:57:12,058 --> 01:57:13,184
He is your brother!

1506
01:58:13,052 --> 01:58:14,246
Hurry up.

1507
01:58:16,355 --> 01:58:19,381
And bring two packets of
Nikhar dye. Dark black.

1508
01:58:22,228 --> 01:58:23,354
Shiksha?

1509
01:58:28,568 --> 01:58:31,162
Shiksha, what are you doing here?

1510
01:58:33,873 --> 01:58:35,135
Are you here to see Vijay?

1511
01:58:38,077 --> 01:58:39,135
Wait here.

1512
01:58:39,479 --> 01:58:41,572
Pappu, come here.

1513
01:58:42,882 --> 01:58:45,476
Tell Vijay, his sister Shiksha
is here. Repeat what I said.

1514
01:58:45,585 --> 01:58:47,485
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1515
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:48,952
Go, come on go!

1516
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:52,515
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1517
01:58:52,625 --> 01:58:54,855
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1518
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:56,986
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1519
01:58:57,096 --> 01:58:59,064
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1520
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:01,599
Tell Vijay, his sister
Shiksha is here... Tell Vijay...

1521
01:59:02,235 --> 01:59:03,998
Vijay's sister Shiksha is here?

1522
01:59:04,103 --> 01:59:07,561
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1523
01:59:07,673 --> 01:59:10,437
Shiksha is here.
- Shiksha is here

1524
01:59:11,377 --> 01:59:12,435
What happened?

1525
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:13,876
Vijay's sister Shiksha is here?

1526
01:59:14,013 --> 01:59:16,208
Ashatai, Vijay's
sister Shiksha is here?

1527
01:59:21,454 --> 01:59:24,014
Look at how all of
them are staring at you?

1528
01:59:27,927 --> 01:59:28,985
Hey...

1529
01:59:29,328 --> 01:59:30,556
...don't be afraid.

1530
01:59:30,663 --> 01:59:32,290
They are all Viju's family.

1531
01:59:32,398 --> 01:59:34,298
Come out. This is my mother.

1532
01:59:36,969 --> 01:59:38,561
Are you really Viju's sister?

1533
01:59:39,105 --> 01:59:40,299
Isn't your name, Shiksha?

1534
01:59:40,406 --> 01:59:42,271
Of course, she really is our Shiksha.

1535
01:59:45,678 --> 01:59:47,543
Do you know it is in these
very hands that you were born?

1536
01:59:47,647 --> 01:59:49,114
She looks exactly like Viju
- I am...

1537
01:59:49,215 --> 01:59:51,115
I am Ashatai.
- She has come from a school.

1538
01:59:51,217 --> 01:59:53,117
You remember, don't you?
- Oh come on Ashatai!

1539
01:59:53,219 --> 01:59:54,277
How will she know?

1540
01:59:54,387 --> 01:59:55,445
Why won't she?

1541
01:59:55,955 --> 01:59:57,252
This is the same lamp post.

1542
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:59,515
I... I am Lachi, remember?

1543
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:00,990
Mother, please!

1544
02:00:01,093 --> 02:00:02,560
You remember, right?

1545
02:00:02,662 --> 02:00:05,187
There, she remembers.

1546
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:09,327
Viju is here...

1547
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:47,666
"There is still somewhere..."

1548
02:00:47,773 --> 02:00:53,575
...some life left in me."

1549
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:59,644
"I see a new ray of hope."

1550
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:06,491
"This tells me I am still alive."

1551
02:01:07,126 --> 02:01:13,292
"A crushed wish lies
buried in this moment."

1552
02:01:13,532 --> 02:01:20,131
"Where had this moment been?"

1553
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:26,178
"It's right in front of
me now. Let me feel it."

1554
02:01:26,379 --> 02:01:32,443
"Do I die or live a little?"

1555
02:01:32,752 --> 02:01:39,089
"Do I embrace the
happiness or shed tears?"

1556
02:01:39,325 --> 02:01:45,389
"Do I die or live a little?"

1557
02:02:37,316 --> 02:02:43,482
"A body that was
scorching in the sun...

1558
02:02:44,156 --> 02:02:49,184
...has found a shade."

1559
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:56,625
"As if an miffed child..."

1560
02:02:57,169 --> 02:03:02,573
...has got his smile back."

1561
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:08,780
"This is somewhat like
my heart feels now."

1562
02:03:09,415 --> 02:03:16,116
"Feels like my old
wounds have healed."

1563
02:03:22,762 --> 02:03:29,167
"Where had this moment been?"

1564
02:03:29,268 --> 02:03:35,503
"It's right in front of
me now. Let me feel it."

1565
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:41,876
"Do I die or live a little?"

1566
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:48,446
"Do I embrace the
happiness or shed tears?"

1567
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:55,159
"Do I die or live a little?"

1568
02:03:55,261 --> 02:04:01,496
"Do I embrace the
happiness or shed tears?"

1569
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:07,766
"Do I die or live a little?"

1570
02:04:09,975 --> 02:04:11,340
Take care.

1571
02:04:13,746 --> 02:04:14,872
Brother, see you.

1572
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:16,242
When can we meet next?

1573
02:04:16,749 --> 02:04:18,478
Anytime you want to.

1574
02:04:18,918 --> 02:04:20,886
Day after tomorrow after school.
- Ok.

1575
02:04:21,387 --> 02:04:22,445
Here... - Bye Kaali.

1576
02:04:22,688 --> 02:04:23,746
Bye.

1577
02:04:23,856 --> 02:04:24,914
Take this as well.

1578
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,349
You have everything, don't you?

1579
02:04:33,532 --> 02:04:34,624
Shiksha...

1580
02:04:35,334 --> 02:04:36,926
tell him he should stay for dinner.

1581
02:04:37,403 --> 02:04:38,495
I already ate.

1582
02:04:38,904 --> 02:04:39,962
Tell him...

1583
02:04:40,773 --> 02:04:42,400
I know that he hasn't eaten yet.

1584
02:05:04,563 --> 02:05:05,689
Begin.

1585
02:05:06,899 --> 02:05:08,230
And you?

1586
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:09,392
I'll eat later.

1587
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:20,878
Brother, you shouldn't
have water while eating.

1588
02:05:22,681 --> 02:05:23,739
Why not?

1589
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:25,809
What will happen?

1590
02:05:26,886 --> 02:05:28,012
Is it an insult to food?

1591
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:29,947
It's a blessing...

1592
02:05:30,656 --> 02:05:31,884
that you remember
some things at least...

1593
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:38,421
Brother... tell me
something about our father.

1594
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:39,589
Shiksha!

1595
02:05:39,999 --> 02:05:41,591
You shouldn't talk while eating.

1596
02:05:47,506 --> 02:05:49,303
What do you want to know?

1597
02:05:49,408 --> 02:05:50,466
Every little thing!

1598
02:05:50,576 --> 02:05:53,477
Whenever I ask mother,
all she says is...

1599
02:05:53,579 --> 02:05:55,444
father was a teacher in Mandwa.

1600
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:57,539
And we moved to Mumbai
after he passed away.

1601
02:05:58,751 --> 02:06:00,582
And...
- That's it!

1602
02:06:00,686 --> 02:06:02,779
Shiksha! Stop talking and eat

1603
02:06:10,429 --> 02:06:12,761
She is only asking about her father.

1604
02:06:14,066 --> 02:06:15,431
It's not a sin.

1605
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:24,740
Our father was a self-respecting man.

1606
02:06:27,446 --> 02:06:28,708
He was against stealing.

1607
02:06:30,816 --> 02:06:32,340
He was against dishonesty.

1608
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:35,948
"Fulfill your Karma...

1609
02:06:37,022 --> 02:06:38,580
don't worry about the reward."

1610
02:06:41,493 --> 02:06:43,927
Life is but a great scene...
- Life is but a great scene.

1611
02:06:45,364 --> 02:06:46,797
That man is walking on

1612
02:06:46,899 --> 02:06:48,332
That man is walking on

1613
02:06:48,934 --> 02:06:52,597
With tears and sweat...
- With tears and sweat

1614
02:06:53,772 --> 02:06:55,364
Soaked in blood
- Soaked in blood

1615
02:06:55,474 --> 02:06:56,736
Soaked in blood
- Soaked in blood

1616
02:07:00,846 --> 02:07:02,438
And that's how he died.

1617
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:05,912
With tears and sweat.

1618
02:07:07,553 --> 02:07:08,645
Soaked in blood.

1619
02:07:09,588 --> 02:07:10,714
Soaked in blood.

1620
02:07:11,557 --> 02:07:13,650
I called you here only to eat.

1621
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,928
And I'm talking about the
man who taught me to eat.

1622
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:18,087
Viju...

1623
02:07:23,135 --> 02:07:24,796
People spat on him and walked away.

1624
02:07:26,038 --> 02:07:27,369
They said...

1625
02:07:28,007 --> 02:07:30,441
"Master Dinanath's
life was worthless...

1626
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:32,909
and his death a waste."

1627
02:07:35,714 --> 02:07:36,874
The one who walked the path of fire...

1628
02:07:37,683 --> 02:07:39,548
didn't even get fire for his pyre.

1629
02:07:39,852 --> 02:07:40,910
Stop it!

1630
02:07:42,488 --> 02:07:43,546
Stop it!

1631
02:07:45,524 --> 02:07:46,650
Stop it!

1632
02:07:47,459 --> 02:07:50,428
The only reason I am alive is
to one day honour his death.

1633
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:54,458
And for last 15 years the
only thing mother has said is...

1634
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,725
stop it, stop it...

1635
02:07:59,605 --> 02:08:00,902
Get out of my house!

1636
02:09:05,738 --> 02:09:06,796
Viju...

1637
02:09:09,842 --> 02:09:12,868
Viju, your mother loves you a lot.

1638
02:09:12,978 --> 02:09:14,639
She just doesn't know how to show it.

1639
02:09:17,449 --> 02:09:19,349
My whole life has gone by, Kaali.

1640
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:23,418
And she hasn't been able
to show her affection yet.

1641
02:09:33,932 --> 02:09:35,058
After all these years...

1642
02:09:36,702 --> 02:09:40,103
if she would just give me a hug...

1643
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:47,676
Look at this, Kaali...

1644
02:09:48,981 --> 02:09:50,346
this is my mother's
love that I hunger for...

1645
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:53,747
the last fifteen years...

1646
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,314
...fifteen years.

1647
02:09:57,156 --> 02:10:03,254
"A pain lies hidden in this moment."

1648
02:10:03,362 --> 02:10:09,790
"Where had this moment been?"

1649
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:32,219
This time the attack
won't be like in the past.

1650
02:10:32,391 --> 02:10:34,086
A special division has been deputed.

1651
02:10:34,226 --> 02:10:35,784
Gaitonde will come here himself.
- Of course.

1652
02:10:35,894 --> 02:10:39,261
He has taken the oath of getting rid
of the drug mafia before retiring.

1653
02:10:39,965 --> 02:10:41,262
Nobody can stop him now.

1654
02:10:41,767 --> 02:10:43,359
We only have time till
the Ganesh festival.

1655
02:10:43,468 --> 02:10:44,833
The Ganesh festival!

1656
02:10:45,137 --> 02:10:46,798
Praise Lord Ganesh.

1657
02:10:49,341 --> 02:10:52,401
But what role is the great
Ganpati essaying in this Mahabharat.

1658
02:10:54,413 --> 02:10:56,176
Viju... Viju...

1659
02:10:56,348 --> 02:10:58,748
there's someone here to see you.

1660
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:00,751
Who is it?

1661
02:11:12,397 --> 02:11:13,728
What are you doing here?

1662
02:11:15,901 --> 02:11:19,803
Kancha sir thought
you could use my help.

1663
02:11:20,873 --> 02:11:22,204
And I'm here to help you.

1664
02:11:23,175 --> 02:11:24,267
Listen...

1665
02:11:24,843 --> 02:11:29,109
We have to kill Gaitonde...

1666
02:11:29,214 --> 02:11:33,378
...before the Ganesh festival.

1667
02:11:34,319 --> 02:11:35,445
Get it?

1668
02:11:40,292 --> 02:11:42,817
Listen, there's
someone here to see you.

1669
02:11:51,536 --> 02:11:52,867
How are you?

1670
02:11:53,939 --> 02:11:56,271
Forget about Kancha, sir...

1671
02:11:57,776 --> 02:11:59,141
or he will have you killed.

1672
02:12:02,948 --> 02:12:05,348
And he has hired you
to do fulfill this task?

1673
02:12:07,986 --> 02:12:09,214
Aren't you afraid?

1674
02:12:09,988 --> 02:12:11,046
You have a family...

1675
02:12:11,156 --> 02:12:13,283
The day I accepted
the police uniform...

1676
02:12:13,392 --> 02:12:15,087
I let go of fear.

1677
02:12:15,527 --> 02:12:19,827
But I am pleased to see
that you still feel afraid.

1678
02:12:20,999 --> 02:12:22,432
Even though it's for someone else.

1679
02:12:25,837 --> 02:12:27,270
Come now, the pooja is about to begin.

1680
02:12:42,487 --> 02:12:43,818
Kancha sir...

1681
02:12:44,323 --> 02:12:45,790
Viju won't kill Gaitonde.

1682
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,823
I saw him leave Gaitonde's house.

1683
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:50,524
Shall I kill him?

1684
02:12:50,829 --> 02:12:52,456
Shall I kill him?

1685
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:09,907
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1686
02:13:10,015 --> 02:13:11,346
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1687
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:13,111
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1688
02:13:13,218 --> 02:13:14,845
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1689
02:13:14,953 --> 02:13:17,922
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1690
02:13:18,023 --> 02:13:21,117
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1691
02:13:21,226 --> 02:13:24,923
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1692
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:30,332
"Anyone who has You in his
heart has fire in his belly."

1693
02:13:31,169 --> 02:13:37,904
"He doesn't care how it
starts and how it ends."

1694
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:44,279
"The sky and earth call out
and rid him of any evil eye."

1695
02:13:44,383 --> 02:13:50,549
"Ever fear fears the one..."

1696
02:13:50,655 --> 02:13:56,321
"...you protect. Hail Lord Ganesh."

1697
02:13:56,428 --> 02:13:59,488
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1698
02:13:59,598 --> 02:14:02,863
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1699
02:14:02,968 --> 02:14:06,597
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1700
02:14:53,085 --> 02:14:56,680
"The reward for your reverence."

1701
02:14:57,322 --> 02:15:00,086
"Anyone who earns it is wealthy."

1702
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:06,920
"Lord, the one who
is unknown to you..."

1703
02:15:07,032 --> 02:15:09,500
...is like a boat without the sail."

1704
02:15:10,235 --> 02:15:12,669
"The rat is your vehicle as such.
You protect everyone."

1705
02:15:13,338 --> 02:15:20,301
"Sins have never been
able to stand up to you."

1706
02:15:20,412 --> 02:15:26,942
"He makes his own destiny."

1707
02:15:27,052 --> 02:15:35,050
"The one who devotes himself to you."

1708
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:38,960
"The one by whom you stand."

1709
02:15:39,064 --> 02:15:42,090
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1710
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:46,000
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1711
02:15:55,113 --> 02:15:57,604
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1712
02:15:57,716 --> 02:16:00,310
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1713
02:16:02,187 --> 02:16:06,351
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1714
02:16:07,759 --> 02:16:09,454
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1715
02:16:51,136 --> 02:16:54,128
Name... Vijay Chauhan.

1716
02:16:59,411 --> 02:17:03,814
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan...

1717
02:17:04,816 --> 02:17:06,181
full name.

1718
02:17:10,188 --> 02:17:11,519
Father's name...

1719
02:17:12,257 --> 02:17:13,724
Master...

1720
02:17:13,825 --> 02:17:15,156
Dinanath...

1721
02:17:16,728 --> 02:17:18,127
Chauhan!

1722
02:17:19,598 --> 02:17:20,724
From...

1723
02:17:22,434 --> 02:17:23,594
Village Mandwa.

1724
02:17:38,550 --> 02:17:41,781
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1725
02:18:34,005 --> 02:18:36,473
Sir, I want to see Mr. Gaitonde.

1726
02:18:36,574 --> 02:18:37,871
He is very busy.

1727
02:18:37,976 --> 02:18:39,443
I'm Vijay Chauhan's mother...

1728
02:18:39,544 --> 02:18:40,670
Suhasini Chauhan.

1729
02:18:40,779 --> 02:18:41,905
Look...

1730
02:18:42,013 --> 02:18:44,607
Iook, that's Surya from our village.

1731
02:18:44,716 --> 02:18:45,842
From Mandwa.

1732
02:18:46,985 --> 02:18:48,953
That's why it is
critical I see Mr. Gaitonde.

1733
02:18:49,054 --> 02:18:51,579
Alright, I'll inform him.

1734
02:18:52,157 --> 02:18:54,887
Yes... His mother's
name is Suhasini Chauhan.

1735
02:18:54,993 --> 02:18:57,723
She is the wife of some
Master Dinanath Chauhan.

1736
02:18:57,829 --> 02:18:58,921
She is from your village...

1737
02:18:59,030 --> 02:19:00,122
Mandwa.

1738
02:19:00,699 --> 02:19:01,757
Kancha sir?

1739
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,766
Kancha sir? Can your hear me?

1740
02:19:06,204 --> 02:19:07,466
Can your hear me?

1741
02:19:07,872 --> 02:19:09,464
Vijay Chauhan...

1742
02:19:11,109 --> 02:19:13,600
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan...

1743
02:19:15,914 --> 02:19:18,815
Vijay... Dinanath Chauhan...

1744
02:19:18,917 --> 02:19:19,975
He will kill us.

1745
02:19:20,218 --> 02:19:21,549
He will kill us.

1746
02:19:21,653 --> 02:19:23,518
Kill us all.

1747
02:19:23,621 --> 02:19:24,849
He will kill all of us.

1748
02:19:24,956 --> 02:19:26,651
Remember... we had killed his father?

1749
02:19:26,758 --> 02:19:27,816
We?

1750
02:19:29,594 --> 02:19:31,892
What are you capable
of killing, father?

1751
02:19:33,031 --> 02:19:34,555
You relax, father.

1752
02:19:35,667 --> 02:19:37,430
Save me...

1753
02:19:37,535 --> 02:19:39,127
Just relax, will you.

1754
02:19:40,905 --> 02:19:43,806
Now I shall write the
19th chapter of this story.

1755
02:19:45,643 --> 02:19:47,770
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan...

1756
02:19:49,647 --> 02:19:50,875
must die.

1757
02:19:56,688 --> 02:19:58,121
If people near and far...
if people who are dead...

1758
02:19:58,223 --> 02:20:00,589
the undead... and I, myself,
have cast an evil eye on you.

1759
02:20:00,692 --> 02:20:04,025
Lord, please take the evil away.

1760
02:20:06,131 --> 02:20:08,656
Viju, who cast a black eye on you!

1761
02:20:08,767 --> 02:20:09,927
Take a deep breath.

1762
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:13,733
Go bring something
to offer Gaitonde sir.

1763
02:20:14,272 --> 02:20:15,534
Quick... hurry up.

1764
02:20:22,947 --> 02:20:25,939
I'm sure Surya's body
reminds you of your childhood.

1765
02:20:31,189 --> 02:20:33,987
For the past 15 years I was
taking an aim in the dark...

1766
02:20:34,092 --> 02:20:35,821
and who would've guessed
that the bulls-eye was Mandwa!

1767
02:20:36,661 --> 02:20:37,889
Vijay Chauhan...

1768
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:40,925
a village teacher's son...

1769
02:20:41,032 --> 02:20:43,000
wants to become the ruler
of the Mumbai underworld.

1770
02:20:43,101 --> 02:20:44,193
But why?

1771
02:20:44,302 --> 02:20:45,701
To carry on his charitable activities?

1772
02:20:46,671 --> 02:20:49,037
Surya's body gave away a
lot of clues about you.

1773
02:20:50,809 --> 02:20:52,640
Ruaf Lala was merely a facilitator.

1774
02:20:53,144 --> 02:20:55,874
Your real goal was Kancha...

1775
02:20:55,980 --> 02:20:57,038
Kancha!

1776
02:20:58,283 --> 02:20:59,841
You did save my life...

1777
02:21:00,218 --> 02:21:01,810
but by getting rid of Surya...

1778
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:03,888
...you have wrecked the
fine balance of time itself.

1779
02:21:04,956 --> 02:21:06,218
Kancha won't remain silent.

1780
02:21:07,759 --> 02:21:08,885
More people are set to die.

1781
02:21:09,828 --> 02:21:11,261
It is enough, Vijay!

1782
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:14,595
You saved my life, that's why...

1783
02:21:14,699 --> 02:21:15,791
In this lifetime, the onus
of repaying your debt...

1784
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:17,026
...is entirely mine, Gaitonde sir.

1785
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:20,895
You'll have to wait
for another lifetime.

1786
02:21:58,743 --> 02:22:00,176
Gaitonde sir left?

1787
02:22:03,815 --> 02:22:05,009
Even I should leave.

1788
02:22:06,317 --> 02:22:07,944
There's a lot of work to be done.

1789
02:22:08,086 --> 02:22:10,020
To top it all,
Sushila left early today.

1790
02:22:10,822 --> 02:22:11,880
Kaali...

1791
02:22:12,023 --> 02:22:14,355
There's work to be done, I
have to shut the parlour.

1792
02:22:14,659 --> 02:22:15,819
Kaali...

1793
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:23,765
Kaali...

1794
02:22:28,806 --> 02:22:30,068
Kaali!

1795
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:37,914
I know the time has come...

1796
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:40,115
for you to leave.

1797
02:22:44,022 --> 02:22:45,216
I get it.

1798
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:47,682
And I won't stop you.

1799
02:22:48,893 --> 02:22:51,885
Don't you worry about anything.

1800
02:22:52,730 --> 02:22:54,698
I'll take care of
everything in your absence.

1801
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:58,998
You can even stop worrying
about your mother and Shiksha.

1802
02:22:59,103 --> 02:23:02,095
I'll look after Shiksha's
education and even get her married.

1803
02:23:02,774 --> 02:23:04,674
I'll take care of day to day things.

1804
02:23:04,776 --> 02:23:06,266
The beauty parlour is there and...

1805
02:23:06,377 --> 02:23:09,369
...I've sort of figured how
to manage the business.

1806
02:23:09,714 --> 02:23:10,772
Go...

1807
02:23:10,882 --> 02:23:12,008
just go...

1808
02:23:18,756 --> 02:23:19,916
Viju.

1809
02:23:21,993 --> 02:23:25,429
I know the place you're going to...

1810
02:23:26,798 --> 02:23:28,993
has your death waiting for you.

1811
02:23:31,402 --> 02:23:33,063
Your mother can see it.

1812
02:23:33,171 --> 02:23:35,435
Gaitonde sir can see it.

1813
02:23:37,342 --> 02:23:38,969
But from where I see it...

1814
02:23:40,845 --> 02:23:42,142
there is nothing...

1815
02:23:44,482 --> 02:23:45,972
but you.

1816
02:23:48,419 --> 02:23:49,818
Only you.

1817
02:23:55,426 --> 02:23:56,791
Therefore...

1818
02:23:57,395 --> 02:24:00,159
the way my life is
and however it is...

1819
02:24:01,099 --> 02:24:02,361
I am fine with it.

1820
02:24:03,968 --> 02:24:06,937
But for now, let me go.

1821
02:24:08,306 --> 02:24:11,002
Please let me go.

1822
02:24:14,779 --> 02:24:15,973
Kaali, wait.

1823
02:24:36,267 --> 02:24:37,359
What?

1824
02:24:37,935 --> 02:24:39,197
Well, this is my wedding fund...

1825
02:24:41,105 --> 02:24:44,871
let's add your fund and
mine and see how much it is...

1826
02:25:12,503 --> 02:25:24,472
"The stars and moon..."

1827
02:25:24,916 --> 02:25:32,880
"...that were always
missing from my sky."

1828
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:46,835
"You've changed the
course of the clouds."

1829
02:25:46,938 --> 02:25:54,242
"All of them have returned today."

1830
02:26:11,329 --> 02:26:18,826
"My beloved."

1831
02:27:35,513 --> 02:27:37,037
Viju...

1832
02:27:45,523 --> 02:27:46,683
Kaali...

1833
02:27:50,127 --> 02:27:51,287
Kaali...

1834
02:27:58,369 --> 02:27:59,495
Kaali...

1835
02:28:01,372 --> 02:28:03,237
Please forgive me, Viju...

1836
02:28:04,141 --> 02:28:05,369
Don't go...

1837
02:28:06,377 --> 02:28:07,810
Please don't go...

1838
02:28:09,146 --> 02:28:10,773
I lived my entire life...

1839
02:28:12,783 --> 02:28:15,149
in this one moment.

1840
02:28:29,767 --> 02:28:31,291
Viju...

1841
02:28:55,426 --> 02:28:56,620
Where is my umbrella?

1842
02:28:56,727 --> 02:28:59,252
Kancha sir, Vijay
Chauhan is still alive.

1843
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:04,527
Vijay Chauhan is alive?

1844
02:29:04,869 --> 02:29:06,666
Vijay Chauhan is still alive?

1845
02:29:06,771 --> 02:29:07,863
You...

1846
02:29:08,172 --> 02:29:10,367
you killed his father.

1847
02:29:10,474 --> 02:29:11,566
Now...

1848
02:29:11,709 --> 02:29:13,233
now he will kill your father.

1849
02:29:13,411 --> 02:29:14,844
And he will kill you too.

1850
02:29:14,946 --> 02:29:16,470
Kill you too!

1851
02:29:16,614 --> 02:29:18,514
He won't spare anyone.

1852
02:29:18,616 --> 02:29:19,810
He'll kill everyone.
He will kill everyone.

1853
02:29:19,917 --> 02:29:22,511
He won't spare anyone.

1854
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:25,521
He won't spare anyone.

1855
02:29:25,656 --> 02:29:28,386
He won't spare anyone.

1856
02:29:52,216 --> 02:29:53,444
Kancha sir...

1857
02:29:56,854 --> 02:29:57,946
Kancha sir...

1858
02:29:58,289 --> 02:30:00,348
We found an abandoned
boat near the coast.

1859
02:30:04,428 --> 02:30:06,862
So Lord Ram has set foot on Lanka.

1860
02:30:08,299 --> 02:30:09,561
Go and check if...

1861
02:30:09,734 --> 02:30:11,668
he has also brought an army along.

1862
02:30:11,769 --> 02:30:12,861
Yes sir.

1863
02:30:12,970 --> 02:30:14,961
Come on move it.

1864
02:30:17,908 --> 02:30:19,933
Go quickly and look there.

1865
02:30:21,479 --> 02:30:23,879
Run!

1866
02:30:24,015 --> 02:30:26,643
Kancha sir, there has
been a big blast there!

1867
02:30:26,784 --> 02:30:28,308
Run, save your lives!

1868
02:30:46,303 --> 02:30:49,238
Kancha sir, Mandwa is burning!

1869
02:30:49,373 --> 02:30:51,671
Run, save your lives!

1870
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:00,841
Your Lanka is burning, Kancha.

1871
02:31:13,864 --> 02:31:16,992
Now go and recreate
a new one from hell.

1872
02:31:30,014 --> 02:31:32,710
You've kept me waiting
a long time, O Lord.

1873
02:31:33,350 --> 02:31:34,874
My eyes have grown weary.

1874
02:32:03,347 --> 02:32:05,645
I'm such an idiot.

1875
02:32:06,383 --> 02:32:11,013
For fifteen years, I've wondered
why the banyan tree withered away.

1876
02:32:12,656 --> 02:32:16,353
It's because I hung your father on it.

1877
02:32:26,036 --> 02:32:28,971
Your father's face
reflects in your eyes.

1878
02:32:29,073 --> 02:32:31,837
Your father, he
wanted to change Mandwa.

1879
02:32:32,042 --> 02:32:34,567
He couldn't.

1880
02:32:37,815 --> 02:32:39,806
But I did.

1881
02:32:40,451 --> 02:32:42,851
In fact, you should be grateful to me.

1882
02:32:42,953 --> 02:32:45,046
What are you doing, my son?

1883
02:32:45,156 --> 02:32:46,646
I told you...

1884
02:32:46,757 --> 02:32:48,122
he will kill.

1885
02:32:48,425 --> 02:32:49,653
If he gets up, he will kill.

1886
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:51,921
Kancha, I told you.

1887
02:32:52,062 --> 02:32:53,689
I told you so!

1888
02:34:01,765 --> 02:34:03,255
You are nothing like me.

1889
02:34:04,101 --> 02:34:05,466
How I wish you were!

1890
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:08,700
No fear, no desire...

1891
02:34:09,006 --> 02:34:11,065
no attachments...

1892
02:34:11,442 --> 02:34:14,411
Just pure bliss.

1893
02:34:26,857 --> 02:34:31,419
But you have attachments and desires.

1894
02:34:31,895 --> 02:34:33,089
Some affection... in you...

1895
02:34:33,230 --> 02:34:35,130
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.

1896
02:34:47,311 --> 02:34:48,369
Brother...

1897
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:49,878
Vijay! Vijay!

1898
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:51,106
Vijay!

1899
02:34:56,053 --> 02:34:57,179
Brother!

1900
02:34:57,288 --> 02:34:58,414
Vijay!

1901
02:35:07,364 --> 02:35:09,798
It's a good thing you
didn't burn my mansion.

1902
02:35:10,301 --> 02:35:12,861
Otherwise just as you've
been mourning for your father...

1903
02:35:13,070 --> 02:35:15,231
you would be mourning for
your mother and sister as well.

1904
02:35:22,846 --> 02:35:24,074
Viju!

1905
02:35:24,281 --> 02:35:25,509
Master's wife?

1906
02:35:25,816 --> 02:35:27,249
Hey, she's the master's wife!

1907
02:35:27,384 --> 02:35:28,908
The master's wife!

1908
02:35:29,019 --> 02:35:30,111
Let me go!

1909
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:31,312
Mother...

1910
02:35:32,489 --> 02:35:33,956
Vijay...

1911
02:35:35,225 --> 02:35:37,352
He is Vijay, the master's son.

1912
02:35:39,430 --> 02:35:41,489
Vengeance after fifteen years.

1913
02:35:41,598 --> 02:35:43,031
Brother!

1914
02:35:43,133 --> 02:35:44,794
And this eerie calm...

1915
02:35:44,902 --> 02:35:46,130
Brother!

1916
02:35:47,538 --> 02:35:51,804
That seems to say a
violent storm is brewing.

1917
02:35:51,942 --> 02:35:54,467
Kancha, spare him.

1918
02:35:54,578 --> 02:35:57,445
The universe is about to explode,
Vijay Chauhan.

1919
02:35:58,082 --> 02:36:00,380
And you will be born again.

1920
02:36:00,551 --> 02:36:04,885
But for that you must
allow death to embrace you.

1921
02:36:09,927 --> 02:36:12,953
No. No. Spare him.

1922
02:36:13,630 --> 02:36:15,894
Somebody help him.

1923
02:36:17,201 --> 02:36:19,328
Somebody please help my son.

1924
02:36:21,939 --> 02:36:23,964
Why are you asking
them for help, mother?

1925
02:36:25,509 --> 02:36:29,468
That night they said nothing
when my father was killed.

1926
02:36:31,081 --> 02:36:32,548
What do you expect them to say now?

1927
02:36:36,153 --> 02:36:37,586
They won't say a word.

1928
02:36:38,288 --> 02:36:41,052
Because they have chosen the devil.

1929
02:36:42,192 --> 02:36:46,856
Now the devil is their
god and also their ruler.

1930
02:36:47,598 --> 02:36:49,532
They have no one else but me.

1931
02:36:50,234 --> 02:36:53,567
So let me fulfill my Karma.

1932
02:36:55,973 --> 02:36:57,270
Brother!

1933
02:36:58,041 --> 02:36:59,372
Viju!

1934
02:37:24,268 --> 02:37:26,293
Save your breath...

1935
02:37:27,538 --> 02:37:29,631
we have to go to the banyan tree.

1936
02:37:46,623 --> 02:37:49,922
Let my brother go!

1937
02:37:56,700 --> 02:37:58,691
Viju...

1938
02:40:16,773 --> 02:40:18,502
Go beat him up!

1939
02:40:18,609 --> 02:40:20,099
Kill them!

1940
02:40:20,210 --> 02:40:22,770
Kill all of them!

1941
02:40:27,751 --> 02:40:30,652
Kill all of them!

1942
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:35,280
Kill all of them!

1943
02:42:45,322 --> 02:42:47,790
And till you become powerful,
you get beaten up everyday.

1944
02:42:49,526 --> 02:42:50,720
Says who?

1945
02:42:50,827 --> 02:42:52,624
Keep reciting the verse with me.

1946
02:42:52,863 --> 02:42:54,854
I derive my strength from this.

1947
02:42:54,965 --> 02:42:56,728
You shall too.

1948
02:42:59,836 --> 02:43:02,566
There you stand, a tall tree

1949
02:43:04,341 --> 02:43:07,242
You are well-laden and tall

1950
02:43:11,381 --> 02:43:16,250
But don't ever ask
for even a little shade

1951
02:43:18,588 --> 02:43:20,215
Don't ever ask

1952
02:43:24,461 --> 02:43:26,224
You will never tire

1953
02:43:27,964 --> 02:43:29,932
you will never rest

1954
02:43:34,838 --> 02:43:36,772
You will never look back

1955
02:43:38,441 --> 02:43:39,738
Take an oath

1956
02:43:40,944 --> 02:43:42,434
Take an oath

1957
02:43:42,979 --> 02:43:44,378
Take an oath

1958
02:43:46,316 --> 02:43:48,580
Life is but a great scene

1959
02:43:51,822 --> 02:43:54,347
That man is walking on

1960
02:43:55,358 --> 02:43:57,826
With tears and sweat

1961
02:43:59,996 --> 02:44:02,260
Soaked in blood

1962
02:44:02,899 --> 02:44:04,764
Soaked in blood

1963
02:44:06,503 --> 02:44:08,471
Soaked in blood

1964
02:44:09,539 --> 02:44:11,632
On the path of fire

1965
02:44:14,477 --> 02:44:16,638
On the path of fire

1966
02:44:20,684 --> 02:44:23,016
On the path of fire

1967
02:44:52,082 --> 02:44:54,812
Father!

1968
02:45:21,912 --> 02:45:23,072
Viju...

1969
02:45:26,683 --> 02:45:30,016
Viju...

1970
02:45:37,527 --> 02:45:38,926
Mother...

1971
02:45:45,902 --> 02:45:47,130
Brother...

1972
02:45:50,674 --> 02:45:52,699
Mother, I did the right thing?

1973
02:45:55,712 --> 02:45:59,842
Mother, I did the
right thing, didn't I?

1974
02:46:04,421 --> 02:46:08,482
I shall pray to the Lord
that in my next birth...

1975
02:46:08,992 --> 02:46:10,823
I want to be your mother again!

1976
02:46:18,201 --> 02:46:19,725
Brother...

1977
02:46:24,641 --> 02:46:25,801
Brother...

1978
02:46:27,911 --> 02:46:29,105
Mother...

1979
02:47:26,736 --> 02:47:28,601
The path of fire

1980
02:47:29,606 --> 02:47:31,699
The path of fire

1981
02:47:32,942 --> 02:47:35,206
The path of fire
