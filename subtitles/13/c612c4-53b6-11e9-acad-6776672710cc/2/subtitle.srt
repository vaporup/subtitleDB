1
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:05,504
You needed a second sacrifice

2
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:07,373
to claim another reward

3
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:09,104
to bring you within 10 paces

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,513
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow

5
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,586
had never met Sky

6
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:16,846
they instantly understood

7
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:19,490
the reason for his defeat

8
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,796
How far am I from the bookshelves?

9
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:37,500
About 10 paces

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,775
10 paces is fine

11
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,121
I need one of you to help me

12
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:27,959
Please decide between yourselves

13
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,827
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning

14
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:44,935
How swift thy sword!

15
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,679
True

16
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:49,580
Sky was a superior warrior

17
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:52,651
He willingly gave his life to this man

18
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,716
He can kill the King

19
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,418
We must proceed

20
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:05,263
That means we will die

21
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,600
Then we die together

22
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:30,581
You were one step ahead of me

23
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,467
Did I hurt you too much?

24
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,204
I should be the one who fights him

25
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:00,210
I want you to live

26
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:04,280
If you died, how could I live?

27
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:10,278
You will live on, promise me

28
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,761
Say it!

29
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:32,835
All right

30
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:43,618
Moon is on her way

31
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,121
I had better go

32
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,620
I am Nameless,
Prefect of Leng Meng County

33
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:36,425
Please allow me to fight this assassin

34
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,598
She is on His Majesty's most wanted list

35
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,637
Now she's here, I will arrest her

36
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,932
The assassin and I have an agreement

37
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:45,835
to fight one on one

38
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:47,078
Should I be unable to defeat her

39
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,578
please apprehend her

40
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:51,447
Your permission is sought

41
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:34,657
Draw your sword!

42
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:07,719
Hail! Hail! Hail!

43
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:09,825
Make your move!

44
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:13,287
Hail! Hail! Hail!

45
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,824
I die willingly

46
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:18,002
Make your move

47
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:26,243
Hail! Hail! Hail!

48
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:35,347
Hail! Hail! Hail!

49
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,588
Hail! Hail! Hail!

50
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:48,723
Hail! Hail! Hail!

51
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:45,180
How swift thy sword!

52
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:05,397
What are you here for?

53
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,568
For what you once said.

54
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:13,006
"I will fight the one
who harms Flying Snow"

55
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:16,073
Please draw your sword

56
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,351
Thank you

57
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:33,926
I believe you and
Broken Sword also fought

58
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:38,001
but rather it was

59
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:43,502
A fight to honor Flying Snow.

60
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:55,785
My master wishes you to have his sword

61
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:01,930
Why?

62
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,864
He and she are bound in life and death

63
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:09,767
They will never part,
nor will their swords

64
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:21,714
It is his dying wish

65
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:23,552
that you take his sword for your mission

66
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:01,858
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

67
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:04,494
sacrificed themselves

68
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,129
so you can be within 10 paces of me

69
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,856
All three gave you their lives

70
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:13,128
The best of friends could not give more

71
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,071
Therefore you are

72
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,707
the most dangerous assassin of all

73
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:31,555
How did you uncover my plan?

74
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:33,821
The flames of these candles

75
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:37,190
are disturbed by your murderous intent

76
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,627
All of you

77
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,137
are willing to die for a cause

78
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,371
I'm ashamed to say
I am not that committed

79
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,568
Your Majesty has seen through our plan

80
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:59,081
If I had realised this sooner

81
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:03,918
I wouldn't have allowed you so close

82
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:07,488
A citizen of Qin would not do this

83
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:08,819
Who are you?

84
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:10,654
A man of Zhao

85
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,527
Your Qin soldiers killed my family

86
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,098
I wandered into Qin

87
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,757
and was adopted

88
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:19,629
I discovered my real identity
10 years ago

89
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:21,938
and set my heart on this plan

90
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,235
You've come to avenge Zhao

91
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,839
I see

92
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,343
I would like to know

93
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,918
if your special skill has a name

94
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:35,550
As Your Majesty guessed

95
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,387
there is only one crucial move

96
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:38,622
What is that?

97
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:40,624
"Death within 10 Paces."

98
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:43,984
"Death within 10 Paces." A good name!

99
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:45,821
All my guards are 100 paces away

100
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,294
outside the palace

101
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:50,627
You are within 10 paces

102
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:52,692
It would seem

103
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:56,796
that today I am doomed

104
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:06,143
But I sense your hesitation

105
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,209
Your Majesty is perceptive

106
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:11,021
However

107
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,420
you too have underestimated someone.

108
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:16,321
Who?

109
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:17,926
Broken Sword

110
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,837
I needed to prove to them

111
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,371
that my sword was fast and accurate

112
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:16,881
Within 10 paces

113
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:19,055
my sword strikes with surgical precision

114
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:21,688
If it enters at precise pressure points

115
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:24,885
it will not cause any fatal injury

116
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,293
If one of you would take a blow

117
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:31,059
before witnesses, we can fool the King

118
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:36,134
Such a blow is hardly child's play

119
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,208
How is Sky now?

120
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:39,871
Fully recovered

121
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,476
His trust in your sword
was extraordinary

122
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,010
The King's security is impenetrable

123
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:46,945
There was no other way

124
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:49,785
His Imperial Guards were useless

125
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:53,724
He should have died three years ago.

126
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:54,958
What went wrong?

127
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,294
I abandoned the plan

128
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:06,066
The King must not be killed

129
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:07,970
He said that?

130
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:08,729
Yes

131
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,929
Why?

132
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:11,539
I also asked him

133
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:12,900
What did he say?

134
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:15,136
He would not explain that day

135
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,146
Broken Sword is the strongest
of the three

136
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,611
He and I are probably equal in skills

137
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:28,984
What he told me later

138
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:31,729
greatly unsettled me

139
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:34,258
While I'm alive

140
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,358
I'll stop you assassinating the King

141
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,667
I will help you

142
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:45,535
He let the opportunity go by

143
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:48,911
This time, we must succeed

144
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:51,478
See you tomorrow at the Qin camp

145
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,687
Please do me a favor

146
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,627
Help me fight Broken Sword!

147
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:16,203
Master!

148
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,878
What are you waiting for?

149
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:27,944
Although I had agreed to help her

150
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:31,046
attack from behind is dishonorable

151
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,881
so I couldn't draw my sword

152
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:35,587
But we both knew

153
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:37,485
if we did not stop Broken Sword

154
00:22:38,463 --> 00:22:40,090
we would never succeed

155
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:32,831
Moon, don't!

156
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:37,107
You're no match for him. Stop

157
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:03,104
I knew this would happen

158
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,838
You can't stop me now

159
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:09,908
Even wounded, I will still stop you

160
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:13,315
Then I will kill you!

161
00:25:20,825 --> 00:25:22,520
Did I hurt him too much?

162
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:24,786
Your special medicine

163
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,787
should heal his wounds in a day

164
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:29,958
Have you delivered it?

165
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:33,036
I tended to the wound myself

166
00:25:33,804 --> 00:25:36,534
After the battle, take my sword

167
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:38,208
and follow Nameless to see the King

168
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:39,576
Yes

169
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:42,074
They won't treat a servant harshly

170
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,848
If the assassination succeeds

171
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,217
wave a red flag on your return

172
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:50,218
If it fails, a yellow one

173
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,685
If something happens to you

174
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,414
any message will be useless

175
00:25:57,628 --> 00:25:59,289
I will smile from Heaven

176
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:01,598
if I see a red flag

177
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:07,421
How is Flying Snow?

178
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:09,023
She is resting

179
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:15,170
She doesn't know I've come

180
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:18,170
You said you'd stop me

181
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:20,209
Please abandon the mission

182
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:21,906
You know I am a man of Zhao

183
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,246
So am I

184
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:25,148
Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao?

185
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,550
Yes

186
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:28,615
Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao?

187
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:29,951
Yes

188
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:32,086
Who are you trying to defend?

189
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:33,787
You call yourself a man of Zhao?

190
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:41,997
Flying Snow has asked me that too

191
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:46,796
When we first met

192
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:49,530
I was living a carefree life

193
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:58,277
I fell in love with her after our first fight

194
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:01,443
She's the daughter of a Zhao general

195
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:04,184
who died in battle against Qin

196
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,215
She inherited his sword

197
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:08,953
I knew she would avenge her father

198
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,922
I promised to help her

199
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,333
Calligraphy and swordplay

200
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:18,926
share the same principles

201
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:21,497
We did calligraphy to
inspire our swordplay

202
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:22,773
and to heighten our powers

203
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:27,073
She knew I'd drifted since childhood

204
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:30,144
calling no place home

205
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:31,675
Once we'd killed the King, she said

206
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:34,908
she would take me to her home

207
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:37,950
There'd be no more swordsmen

208
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,547
only a man

209
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,814
and a woman

210
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:11,680
The essence of calligraphy
is from the soul

211
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:13,389
Swordsmanship is the same

212
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:16,285
Both aspire to truth and simplicity

213
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:18,921
Gradually I recognised a greater cause

214
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:28,004
Three years ago we perfected our skills

215
00:29:28,672 --> 00:29:30,299
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead

216
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,267
Together, we stormed the palace

217
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:14,119
She asked why I had abandoned the mission

218
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:17,186
I told her the King must not be killed

219
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:20,561
That is what calligraphy taught me

220
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,261
I didn't kill the King

221
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:25,762
After that she refused to talk to me

222
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:33,539
Please abandon your plan

223
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:34,703
No

224
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:37,278
Was your sword forged in hatred?

225
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:38,640
Yes

226
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,978
For 10 years, it has never tired

227
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,713
I can't stop now

228
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:46,513
How can I dissuade you?

229
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:48,354
Only by killing me

230
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:50,184
Are you that determined?

231
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:51,895
Yes

232
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:54,991
Allow me to convey my conviction

233
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:57,964
in three words

234
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:43,144
These words express my mind

235
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:45,571
Please consider

236
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:57,894
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless

237
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:00,155
Flying Snow and I will never part

238
00:36:00,397 --> 00:36:01,796
nor will our swords

239
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:17,837
Master Nameless

240
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:20,079
although I am just a humble servant

241
00:36:20,751 --> 00:36:22,480
allow me to say a few words

242
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:26,613
I've been with my master since
I was eight

243
00:36:27,124 --> 00:36:28,785
He taught me martial arts

244
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:30,821
and how to be a decent person

245
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:33,225
Whatever my master does

246
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,920
is for a good reason

247
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:37,999
The words he has given you

248
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:40,499
carry a deep meaning

249
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:48,575
This will be the Iast thing
I can do for my master

250
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:53,847
Master Nameless, please take his advice

251
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:08,225
Why did you want to do that?

252
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:10,229
I wanted to follow the
example of my master

253
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:13,129
and to persuade you with my life

254
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:15,771
You're still young
Life is precious

255
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:18,668
If you must die
you should die for a greater cause

256
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:24,707
Be on your way

257
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:27,473
I will remember
what should be remembered

258
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:48,092
What were the words he wrote?

259
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:49,772
"All under Heaven."

260
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,805
All under Heaven...

261
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,168
Broken Sword said

262
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,877
"The people
have suffered years of warfare

263
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,478
"Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos

264
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,784
"by uniting all under Heaven."

265
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:06,220
He asked me to abandon the assassination

266
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,718
for the greater good of all

267
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,787
He said, one person's suffering
is nothing

268
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:15,294
compared to the suffering of many

269
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:18,095
The rivalry of Zhao and Qin is trivial

270
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:22,027
compared to the greater cause

271
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,578
The person who really understands me

272
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:31,372
is my most feared enemy

273
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:38,648
Alone, I have endured so much criticism

274
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:42,552
So many attempts on my life

275
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:45,193
No one understands my intentions

276
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,762
Even my court officials

277
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:51,467
see me as a tyrant

278
00:38:54,104 --> 00:38:57,073
But I never imagined

279
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,367
that Broken Sword, my arch-enemy

280
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:02,077
would truly understand

281
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,449
and appreciate my real motives

282
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:19,885
I would like to know

283
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:23,662
how you mean to kill me
without your sword?

284
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:25,427
By capturing yours!

285
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:41,284
This sword has protected me

286
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:42,918
through all my battles

287
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:46,916
Having found a true confidant
in Broken Sword

288
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,956
if I die, I am content with my life

289
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,353
Let "All under Heaven"

290
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:56,890
guide your decision

291
00:42:02,392 --> 00:42:03,757
It's just dawned on me!

292
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:05,653
This scroll of Broken Sword's

293
00:42:05,862 --> 00:42:07,853
isn't about sword technique

294
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:10,464
but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal

295
00:42:11,034 --> 00:42:14,003
Swordsmanship's first achievement

296
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:15,670
is the unity of man and sword

297
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,830
Once this unity is attained

298
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:20,271
even a blade of grass can be a weapon

299
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:22,174
The second achievement is when

300
00:42:22,345 --> 00:42:26,111
the sword exists in one's heart

301
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,807
when absent from one's hand
One can strike an enemy at 100 paces

302
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:31,043
even with bare hands

303
00:42:31,988 --> 00:42:33,819
Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement

304
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:38,350
is the absence of the sword
in both hand and heart

305
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:39,855
The swordsman is at peace

306
00:42:40,063 --> 00:42:41,257
with the rest of the world

307
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:44,524
He vows not to kill

308
00:42:45,235 --> 00:42:46,998
and to bring peace to mankind

309
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:17,694
Your Majesty,
your visions have convinced me

310
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,201
that you are committed to the highest ideal

311
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:24,640
of ultimate swordsmanship

312
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:28,170
Therefore I cannot kill you

313
00:43:31,214 --> 00:43:34,149
Remember those who gave their lives

314
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:37,319
for the highest ideal: peace.

315
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:17,273
No more killing
Nameless went within 10 paces of the King

316
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:20,675
He could not have missed

317
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:24,346
There is only one explanation

318
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:26,348
He must have abandoned the mission

319
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:29,891
What did you say to him?

320
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:31,892
I wrote three words

321
00:46:32,695 --> 00:46:33,684
What words?

322
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:35,959
"All under Heaven."

323
00:46:39,102 --> 00:46:40,626
That is all you care about!

324
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,734
And you

325
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:44,905
I don't believe you

326
00:46:45,174 --> 00:46:46,436
How can I convince you?

327
00:46:55,151 --> 00:46:56,118
Draw your sword

328
00:46:58,788 --> 00:46:59,880
You've misled Nameless

329
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:02,914
You've ruined Sky
and the Kingdom of Zhao

330
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,326
Draw!

331
00:47:08,264 --> 00:47:10,095
When we first met...

332
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:13,500
I had to prove myself to convince you

333
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:18,170
What can I do this time?

334
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:20,200
Just draw your sword!

335
00:48:47,296 --> 00:48:48,820
Why didn't you fend off my sword?

336
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:51,766
So that you'd believe me

337
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:01,967
I always wanted to go home with you

338
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,050
Sadly, it won't happen now

339
00:49:14,257 --> 00:49:15,747
Take good care of yourself

340
00:49:29,906 --> 00:49:31,464
Why didn't you defend yourself?

341
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:42,049
Why didn't you defend yourself?

342
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,762
Why didn't you?

343
00:51:06,936 --> 00:51:09,234
No more drifting, no more roaming

344
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:17,779
I'm taking you home now

345
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:21,882
Our home

346
00:52:37,193 --> 00:52:38,751
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

347
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:42,021
Permission to execute?

348
00:52:43,065 --> 00:52:44,464
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

349
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:47,928
Permission to execute?

350
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,782
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty

351
00:53:10,993 --> 00:53:12,324
Show no mercy!

352
00:53:12,495 --> 00:53:16,056
This is the law of Qin!

353
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:20,798
To conquer all under Heaven

354
00:53:21,003 --> 00:53:23,062
the law must be enforced

355
00:53:23,306 --> 00:53:25,866
Set an example for the world!

356
00:53:27,877 --> 00:53:30,437
Execute him! Execute him!

357
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:32,045
Execute him!

358
00:53:35,351 --> 00:53:37,751
Execute him! Execute him!

359
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,410
Execute him!

360
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:50,032
Execute him!

361
00:55:11,514 --> 00:55:15,416
Hail! Hail! Hail!

362
00:55:18,854 --> 00:55:30,231
Hail! Hail! Hail!
