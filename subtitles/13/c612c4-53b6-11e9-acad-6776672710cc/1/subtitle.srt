1
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:30,000
HERO

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,990
Two thousand years ago..
during the Warring States period,
China was divided into seven Kingdoms.

3
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:41,711
For years they battled for supremacy
while the people suffered.

4
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:48,221
The King of Qin was the most ruthless
in his efforts to conquer the land
and unify all under heaven.

5
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:53,889
He was regarded as a common threat
by the other six Kingdoms.

6
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,337
The annals of Chinese history
are abound with tales of the assassins
sent to kill the great King.

7
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:03,515
This is one of the legends...

8
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,252
I was orphaned at an early age

9
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,121
I had no name,
so people called me Nameless

10
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,457
Being a nobody,
I studied swordsmanship

11
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:57,762
After 10 years of practice

12
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:59,902
I acquired a unique skill

13
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,735
The King of Qin has summoned me

14
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:06,533
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom

15
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,308
By order of His MaJesty

16
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:49,610
we have brought the mighty warrior

17
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:13,237
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

18
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:16,202
the three assassins from Zhao

19
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:19,006
have sought His MaJesty's life
for 10 years

20
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:22,514
His MaJesty has known no peace

21
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:25,381
To the astonishment of all

22
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:29,321
a mighty warrior of Qin
has smashed them

23
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,594
His MaJesty can finally sleep at night!

24
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,527
We reJoice for our King!

25
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,327
This warrior sent from Heaven

26
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,537
has exterminated the assassins

27
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,557
Summon the warrior!

28
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:48,027
Remain 100 paces from His MaJesty

29
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:51,729
Or you will be executed.
Never forget that

30
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:28,334
No one is allowed
within 100 paces of me

31
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:29,670
Do you know why?

32
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,545
To guard against assassins

33
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,317
Yes. That's why I am confined
in this armor

34
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:39,455
You have removed a great peril for me

35
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:41,818
How should I reward you?

36
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,589
My service was for Qin, not for a reward

37
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,858
Achievements must be rewarded

38
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:55,994
Sky's silver spear...

39
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,338
wounded many of my brave warriors

40
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,070
Announce my edict!

41
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,472
By order of His MaJesty

42
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:09,982
he who kills Sky
will receive gold and land

43
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,484
and be allowed to drink

44
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,121
within 20 paces of His MaJesty

45
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:37,177
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin

46
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,847
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County

47
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:43,042
A County Prefect over 10 square miles!

48
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:46,414
Surely the lowest-ranking official in Qin

49
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,782
How did you defeat such opponents?

50
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,386
I took them on one by one

51
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:54,555
Tell me the details

52
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,090
Does Your MaJesty know

53
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,630
Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?

54
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:00,335
Yes, I do

55
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:03,436
And that they hadn't spoken
for three years?

56
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,138
For three years? Why?

57
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,277
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky

58
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,075
Broken Sword never forgave her

59
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,780
Why haven't I heard this before?

60
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:18,446
I went to great lengths to uncover it

61
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:22,090
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword

62
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,050
I first needed to eliminate Sky

63
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,330
I have an idea of what you planned

64
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,998
Your MaJesty is wise

65
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,627
What did you use to defeat Sky?

66
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:34,994
The sword

67
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:40,130
I must arrest criminals in my county

68
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,433
On the fifth day of the sixth month

69
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,177
Sky attended a chess house

70
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:45,639
I had learnt he enJoyed playing chess

71
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:48,678
and listening to music there

72
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:10,898
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace

73
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,638
We are here to arrest you!

74
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:17,544
Identify yourself by showing your spear

75
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:10,456
Halt!

76
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:22,097
What can a minor official do?

77
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,272
This is my territory

78
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:25,741
So?

79
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,908
You are on the King's most wanted list

80
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,674
I am placing you under arrest

81
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:09,636
Old man, please play one more tune

82
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,033
Martial arts and music are different

83
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,973
but they share the same principle

84
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:42,236
Both stress attaining a supreme state

85
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,579
Sky and I faced each other
for a long time

86
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:49,682
Neither of us moved

87
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:54,579
We fought the battle in our minds

88
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,359
How swift thy sword!

89
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:52,661
I thought I knew everything
about my Kingdom

90
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,530
I didn't know that Leng Meng County

91
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,001
held a talent like yours

92
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,137
Broken Sword

93
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:07,977
Flying Snow

94
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,617
By order of His MaJesty!

95
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,480
Flying Snow and Broken Sword

96
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,280
have teamed up for assassination

97
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,015
He who kills either of them

98
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,888
will receive gold and land

99
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,187
and be allowed to drink

100
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,024
within 10 paces of His MaJesty

101
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:43,718
Three years ago, Flying Snow

102
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:46,352
stormed the palace with Broken Sword

103
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:50,219
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them

104
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:55,430
I've since emptied the palace

105
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:58,122
so assassins cannot hide

106
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,696
Was your sword swifter
than theirs combined?

107
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:02,899
No

108
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,842
How did you do it, then?

109
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,154
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao

110
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,789
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao

111
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:25,553
I learned they were hiding

112
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:28,358
in a calligraphy school

113
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:31,461
under the names Highcliff and Springbrook

114
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:32,798
Rumor had it

115
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,936
the Qin army would attack that day

116
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,500
Most of the townspeople had fled

117
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,701
Only the school's students remained

118
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,043
Why have you come at such a time?

119
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:45,270
Who are you?

120
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,478
I'm from Yi County
in the Kingdom of Zhao

121
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,013
My father's dying wish

122
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,148
was for one of your scrolls

123
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:56,788
I fear this may be our school's last day

124
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,857
Which calligrapher do you seek?

125
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,790
I respectfully request Master Highcliff

126
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,430
Highcliff was Broken Sword

127
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,258
Legend said his skill as a swordsman

128
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,767
was rooted in his calligraphy

129
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,969
So I had my concerns

130
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,504
I needed to find out if it was true

131
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,404
What do you want written?

132
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,774
"Sword."

133
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:24,842
You are fond of the sword?

134
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,356
It was my father's dying wish

135
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:40,761
What size scroll?

136
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:42,926
Eight feet

137
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,840
For that size I will need red ink

138
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,735
My master has asked me

139
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,510
to borrow some red ink

140
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,910
My master wants to borrow some red ink

141
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,457
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

142
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,357
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink

143
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:15,931
Tell him to come himself

144
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,584
Could I have some red ink?

145
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,032
The character "sword"
was still being written

146
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,872
when Your MaJesty's troops

147
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,099
arrived at the city gates

148
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,947
Draw!

149
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:56,092
Your MaJesty's army is invincible

150
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:57,731
not only because it is brave

151
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,833
but also because of its archery

152
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,934
with a greater range than any other army

153
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:07,939
The Qin archers are like artillery

154
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,578
intimidating the enemy

155
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,859
Hail! Hail! Hail!

156
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:11,238
Please remember

157
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,298
their arrows might destroy our town

158
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:18,274
and topple our Kingdom

159
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,179
but they can never
obliterate our culture

160
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:23,877
Today

161
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:28,589
you will learn the essence of our culture

162
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,886
Hail! Hail! Hail!

163
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:21,375
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

164
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,578
They drew strength from their calligraphy

165
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:26,406
What was so difficult about "sword"?

166
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,243
There are 19 different ways to write it

167
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,917
I asked Broken Sword

168
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:34,021
for a 20th way

169
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:35,278
Both calligraphy and swordplay

170
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,855
rely on one's strength and spirit

171
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:39,082
The 20th style would reveal

172
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:42,353
the essence of his swordsmanship

173
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:45,566
How odd to write it in 19 ways

174
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:47,492
It makes the written language

175
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,300
impossible to comprehend

176
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:53,073
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms

177
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:54,740
and all the northern tribes

178
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,470
I will eradicate this problem

179
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,805
by mandating one style of writing

180
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:01,448
Wouldn't that be ideal?

181
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,742
Your MaJesty won't stop
at the six Kingdoms?

182
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,749
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

183
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:09,647
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands

184
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:12,789
and establish a great empire

185
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:18,364
Hail! Hail! Hail!

186
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,266
Master Springbrook

187
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:00,868
Why are you going outside?

188
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,503
To fend off the arrows

189
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,903
You aren't needed. Stay inside

190
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:08,414
The Qin archers are powerful

191
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:10,584
You alone may not stop them

192
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:45,919
Hail! Hail! Hail!

193
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,099
You are good

194
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,038
You are even better

195
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:45,971
You didn't come here for calligraphy

196
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:48,740
Who are you?

197
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:52,644
I've travelled here to deliver an item

198
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,583
Please meet me in the library at midnight

199
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:06,250
Great calligraphy

200
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:07,750
Great swordplay

201
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,290
You didn't even see my swordplay

202
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:13,229
I couldn't have written without it

203
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:15,627
At midnight

204
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,998
meet me in the library

205
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,374
Several hundred thousand Qin troops

206
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:25,135
were readying for the next onslaught

207
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:28,648
I studied the character all night

208
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,649
trying to unlock the secret of his skills

209
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,391
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

210
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,331
But it's Just an ordinary word

211
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:53,536
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar

212
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,570
One must comprehend their true essence

213
00:29:57,612 --> 00:29:58,772
Did you discover it?

214
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,342
It eluded me

215
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:04,550
So how did you challenge them?

216
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:08,615
Although they hadn't spoken in three
years They spied on each other

217
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:10,313
At midnight

218
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,790
Broken Sword would peek into
Flying Snow's room

219
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,032
At 2 o'clock in the morning

220
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,466
she would spy on Broken Sword

221
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,307
What strange behaviour

222
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:37,051
I was surprised too

223
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:41,016
So I used Sky's silver
spear to get to them

224
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:52,026
Sky died by your sword?

225
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,232
Yes

226
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,967
Who are you? Why are you here?

227
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,839
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin

228
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,839
I have a message from Sky

229
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:04,209
Go on

230
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:05,376
He said he had lived a life

231
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:08,413
without responsibilities or commitments

232
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,550
He cared for only one person

233
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:12,751
Who?

234
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,179
Flying Snow

235
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,435
Sky was certain she'd avenge his death

236
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,180
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp

237
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,316
You can leave now

238
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,027
Go!

239
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,068
I know you saw us!

240
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,633
Let me tell you

241
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,139
we've been together for three years

242
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:01,748
I let you see us on purpose!

243
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:06,419
I no longer care about you at all!

244
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:55,460
We were both very foolish

245
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:36,499
I just wanted you to care about me

246
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,472
I'm not going to fight you

247
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:16,674
Go away!

248
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:25,217
I will kill you in honor of my master!

249
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:57,772
You ask to die. I will help you.

250
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,558
Why do you laugh?

251
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:05,026
What you did last night was stupid

252
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,471
My plan proved successful

253
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,703
When Flying Snow was fighting me

254
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,845
she was disturbed and disoriented

255
00:43:57,317 --> 00:43:59,182
I defeated her easily

256
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,265
I never imagined supreme warriors

257
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,233
Iike Broken Sword and Flying Snow

258
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,235
allowing their emotions
to be a liability

259
00:44:37,224 --> 00:44:40,660
It sounds as if you did divide them

260
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:41,790
Yes

261
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:43,323
In that case, they must have been

262
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,499
petty and narrow-minded

263
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:47,656
True

264
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,597
Your story sounds logical

265
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,863
But

266
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:54,973
you have underestimated one person.

267
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,206
Who?

268
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,144
Me

269
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,515
Would you like my impression of them?

270
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,082
Three years ago they stormed the palace

271
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:09,353
I was impressed

272
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:11,950
by their valor and dignity

273
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:13,955
Their character could not be petty

274
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,226
So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie

275
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:19,024
Their betrayal of one another is a lie

276
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,200
The story you Just told is a lie!

277
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:28,669
Except for one thing

278
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,611
Sky did know one of you

279
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,804
Who?

280
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:37,309
You

281
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:41,381
I surmise you two were old friends

282
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:45,957
And Sky's defeat has only one explanation

283
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,149
What's that?

284
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,658
He permitted it

285
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,562
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact

286
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:02,674
using my men as witnesses

287
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:04,935
That was not hard to arrange

288
00:46:05,145 --> 00:46:07,409
The hardest part was to persuade Sky

289
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:08,912
to put his life in your hands

290
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,915
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky

291
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,850
He died willingly under your sword

292
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:18,418
Such devotion deserves true respect

293
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:20,191
He was the first to sacrifice himself

294
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,260
for your mission

295
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:27,156
Sky was proud

296
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,062
He saw himself as an unrivalled fighter

297
00:46:29,236 --> 00:46:31,966
What convinced him you could succeed

298
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:33,606
where he had failed?

299
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:38,767
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years

300
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:41,205
with one goal, my assassination

301
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:44,009
You have a great skill
that few can counter

302
00:46:54,628 --> 00:46:58,029
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me

303
00:46:58,198 --> 00:47:00,996
So why seek out
Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

304
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:04,436
I surmise that your skill

305
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:06,573
requires you to come within 10 paces
