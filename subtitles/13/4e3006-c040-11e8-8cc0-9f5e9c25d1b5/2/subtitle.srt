1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,540
Stop, you are not capable
to defeat them.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,460
Brother Koo, are we going to
take her along with us?

3
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,860
Cut the crap.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,460
Those who are hurt by
Asia the Invincible,

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,460
Are all our friends.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,260
We can't defeat them by kung-fu,
let's use the cannon.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,420
If you do so, we will die together.

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,740
A part of this ship has been...

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,340
destroyed by Asia the Invincible.

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,340
If we try to attack each other
by the cannon...

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,300
the ship will be sunned,
all of us will die.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,220
Brother Koo,
the cannon has no blast wire.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,620
Save your crocodile tears,
this ship can't stay any longer.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,660
As we just want to survive.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,540
Give us Snow, then we'll let you go.

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,180
Right, Highlanders are Highlanders,
Hans are Hans.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,620
We're of different world.

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,140
Give us Snow, then we'll let you go.

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,900
Have you forgotten...

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,100
how Snow treated you?

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,100
For this sinner.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,700
Don't you think
it's worth dying with us?

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,260
Ching, don't let the wind
extinguish the fire.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,700
Sir, this ship has run aground,

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,100
if we delay anymore,
we will be sunk with this ship.

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,460
Ling, in such as emergency,

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,180
how can you talk like this?

28
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,300
What do you mean?

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,540
No, I don't want to die like this.

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,420
You have internal conflicts
among yourselves.

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,300
You are not as united as us.

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,060
Sir, I don't want to rescuer her.

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,620
Please let me go!

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,060
To betray us at such critical moment?
You are not my subordinate.

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,420
Go now.

36
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,620
Thank you, Sir!

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,580
Come and join us.

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,420
He knew our drawbacks.

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,500
So I have to do so,
please forgive me.

40
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,700
Ching, in order to save an enemy.

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,620
We have to kill our man,

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,140
What's that are we going
to rescue or kill?

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,780
Brother Koo, what's the matter?

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,380
Brother Koo. You...

45
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,820
I think, your valves are closed
by a supreme kung-fu master.

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,180
The blood is flowing backward.

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
You are seriously hurt,
you are dying!

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,020
Yes, I am hurt by
Asia the Invincible.

49
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,860
We are dying too.

50
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,900
Since you cannot protect yourself,
why should you save me?

51
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,300
It's me who leaded him here.

52
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,060
I have to bear all responsibilities.

53
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,300
When the sun rises from the East.

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,980
That'll be the end of your life.

55
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,780
That's why...

56
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,460
I time the time left.

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,540
The noise.

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,060
Shit, it's the Spanish warship.

59
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,620
The Spanish warship is approaching.

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,580
Where is it?

61
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,140
They come for...

62
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,140
Asia the Invincible.

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,180
We hand the flag
of our Sun Moon Sect.

64
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,700
They will shoot us
once they see the flag!

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,580
Don't listen to him,
don't listen to him.

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,180
What are you waiting?

67
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,340
Lower the sail.
Face them with the cannon.

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,300
You are the courtier of the gov't,
don't cheat me with such trick.

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,220
Why should I cheat you?

70
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,540
- Ching, lower the sail.
- Don't move!

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,340
Or I will fire you!

72
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,180
Ching, go now.

73
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,180
Ching, it's peaceful around.

74
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Luckily we haven't met
another warship.

75
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,620
Brother Koo,

76
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,820
when will this woman leave us?

77
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,980
Just throw me into the sea.

78
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,700
Brother Koo.

79
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,900
Stop helping me.

80
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
Will you call me dog again?

81
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,620
Unless you take off this dog's clothe,
or you'll be dog forever.

82
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,220
Go on insulting me if you feel great.

83
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,500
Hold it.

84
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,940
Stop thinking anything nonsense,
Asia the Invincible will not come back.

85
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,900
I know you must hate him.

86
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,620
I am just worrying about him.

87
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,820
He is fooled by fate,
he can't escape.

88
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,820
If I were Asia the Invincible.

89
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,180
I won't leave you.

90
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,780
Ching, when will we reach the camps?

91
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,980
According to the speed
of the current.

92
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,140
We can reach the camps after 6 hours.

93
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,700
Wear it, I am Asia the Invincible.

94
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,820
Boss, she sings better than you.

95
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,980
Give way!

96
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,220
Damn you, where do you come from?

97
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,580
Do you want to take
the bread out of our mouths?

98
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,220
Are you the one
who gives order here?

99
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,500
You want to challenge me?

100
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,220
Not necessary, tonight,
I will listen to you.

101
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,620
Where are the pretty girls?

102
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,780
Stop bothering me.

103
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,380
Are your boss looking for me?

104
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,060
I do want it, so what?

105
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,540
You are not qualified to touch me.

106
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,540
Damn it!

107
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,900
Do you think that you are protected,
so you don't even respect me!

108
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,260
I tell you, we wanderers are nasty.

109
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,580
Today, you are the boss,
tomorrow I will be the boss.

110
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,460
She is sick, let me serve your boss.

111
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,700
Get up.

112
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,420
Breathless? He is breathless.

113
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,980
Kidding?

114
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,660
Gut up, wake up.

115
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,820
How are you, Master?

116
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,060
How are you, Master?

117
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,060
Mo Yan Lu Choung.

118
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,540
Mo Yan Lu Choung.

119
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,620
If you want to take them away,

120
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,980
gamble with me.

121
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,100
If you win, you may take them away.

122
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,300
I think you two
are great kung-fu masters.

123
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,380
But, this is such a small bet.

124
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,460
Why not make it bigger?

125
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,780
What?

126
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,340
The winner can take us away,

127
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,100
The bet is too simple.

128
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,700
Why not cut the legs
off from the loser?

129
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,780
You want to add
a pair of legs for gambling?

130
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,860
What? Are you scared?

131
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,340
Okay. I won't give it a damn.

132
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,580
Just go ahead.

133
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,420
it depends on fate.

134
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,940
What do you want to bet?

135
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,020
Big or small?

136
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,620
Small!

137
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,140
How about you?

138
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,100
Big!

139
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,220
Fine!

140
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,500
No need to open it. I am the winner.

141
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,980
I have to open it.

142
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,020
The dead won't argue with me.

143
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,060
I am still here.

144
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,340
The loser should pay his legs.

145
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,100
Open, 4,5,6. Big.

146
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,980
You lost.

147
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Don't offend him.

148
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,060
Cut your legs off.

149
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,540
How dare you!

150
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,700
General Mo Yan Lu Chong,
we will follow you.

151
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,980
Please let her go.

152
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,620
She doesn't know the rules.

153
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,900
All of you go back,
take her to see me tonight.

154
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,300
Yes.

155
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,460
General...

156
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,620
Mo Yan Lu Chong.

157
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,620
Don't think that
it's an ordinary bet.

158
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,820
Some one will come to take your legs.

159
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,100
Go.

160
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,700
I haven't known your name yet.

161
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,100
I am the same as you,
we have no names.

162
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,500
The people are heartless
and they claimed me heartless.

163
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,660
I am sorry to drag you down.

164
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,540
I should have to thank you.

165
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,860
It's you who let me know that.

166
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,580
It's painful to be
an ordinary people.

167
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,540
Who are you?

168
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,460
Me?

169
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,420
About the answer of it...
I do want to know too

170
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,500
Help yourself!

171
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,540
Mo Yan Lu Chong, long time no see.

172
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,460
Asia the Invincible, here you are.

173
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,740
After you had visited
the Black Cliff 3 years ago.

174
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,540
I wrote to Japan
to check which generation...

175
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,180
you are of the
Mo Yan Lu Chong Family.

176
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,460
Asia the Invincible,
you are very smart.

177
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,380
Oh! How come?

178
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,820
I had told you...

179
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
that someone would
come for your legs.

180
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,340
You've known my background already.

181
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,580
Right! Because all the troops of the
real Mo Yan Lu Chong were destroyed.

182
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,860
Since the 4th generation of...

183
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,500
Mo Yan Lu Chong Family has been
taken over by Liu Seng already.

184
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,140
Watch my Mo Yan Sword.

185
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,940
Cut!

186
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,940
Ninja Disappearance!

187
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,180
- It's your real face.
- Thunder Bomb!

188
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,500
Ninjas come out!

189
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,940
Poison liquid.

190
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,700
You're also a great Kung-fu master.

191
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,980
Why do you pretend
to be Mo Yan Lu Chong?

192
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,340
What a pity! Actually,
you are a miserable as I do.

193
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,140
You dare not show others
your real face.

194
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,620
Sir, are you alright?

195
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,460
I'm fine, go out.

196
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,500
Yes.

197
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,700
"Commander of Ming Dynasty Navy"

198
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,820
Why there isn't any guard?

199
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,180
Go in and take a look!

200
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,980
I've caught it, I've caught it!
it is still yelling!

201
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Here comes Officer Koo.

202
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,900
Where is Officer Tin?

203
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,820
Officer Tin? He hasn't waken up yet.

204
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,660
Still haven't got up
to inspect the military affairs yet.

205
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,100
Being navy officers of Ming Dynasty,
all of you are badly disciplined.

206
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,180
You come here to settle the riot.

207
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,260
You are such a mess.
How can you fight with the enemas?

208
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,940
Keep on insulting.

209
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,220
I don't mind giving a lecture
to your damn soldiers.

210
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,900
How would you tackle
your foes when they come?

211
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,900
Yes Sir.

212
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,740
Greet. It's great!

213
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,140
- Brother Koo.
- Brother Kai Wan.

214
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,460
Brother Koo.

215
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,260
Your camp is loosely guarded,

216
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,060
don't you afraid of
any attack from the foes?

217
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,180
How come! There are so many foes.

218
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,740
All of us just want to live.

219
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,380
Not many people like fighting.

220
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,740
Brother Kai Wan.

221
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,380
May I know your good name?

222
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,820
Get us 2 jars of Kaoliang, hurry up.

223
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,540
Coming, don't be in such a hurry.
Making you drunk.

224
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,460
Get us the main course.

225
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,700
Get me some more wine.

226
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,500
There are many advantages
of being a soldier.

227
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,820
When you hunt, you will get
supply of guns from the Court.

228
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:26,940
There are chefs from the Court
who take care of our meals.

229
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,580
I treasure my fortune,

230
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,780
so I enjoy sharing nice things
with my bosom friends.

231
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,740
come, have a cup of wine with us.

232
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,260
Brother Kai Wan.

233
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,740
You bastard.

234
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,540
How adore you scold me?

235
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,700
General...

236
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,660
There is something wrong
in the Western yard.

237
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,980
- What's happening?
- No information right now.

238
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,220
- Assembly!
- General!

239
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,940
General.
Here comes Asia the Invincible.

240
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,220
All our soldiers have been injured.

241
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,500
General, Asia the Invincible
is so cruel that,

242
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,740
the soldiers of our two battalions
were seriously injured.

243
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,500
So powerful? Let me handle him.

244
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,980
- The force of Battalion 7 follow me.
- Yes, Sir.

245
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,140
it is the one in red.

246
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,380
I want to compete with you.

247
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,260
Move faster. Protect His Excellency.

248
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,180
Protect His Excellency.

249
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,700
Brother Koo.

250
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,380
Chin, if something
happened unexpectedly,.

251
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,260
You would have to leave here at once.

252
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,940
Brother Kai wan.

253
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,220
Officer Koo,
which part you've got hurt?

254
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,300
Brother Kai Wan, cheer up...

255
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Brother Kai Wan...

256
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:29,340
It's funny. It's really very funny.

257
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,820
Our camp is the happiest one.

258
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,300
We haven't enjoyed
such a game for a long time.

259
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,180
It's rare for us having visitors.

260
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,060
Brother Koo, it's a funny game.

261
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm afraid that you have never
got such a chance to play.

262
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,420
Brother Koo, don't you believe
there is Asia the Invincible?

263
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,980
Of course, there is an
Asia the Invincible.

264
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,820
Call our Asia the Invincible out.

265
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,380
Asia the Invincible...

266
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,780
Asia the Invincible?

267
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,060
See, our Asia the Invincible
is not so bad.

268
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,940
Officer Tin and all officers!

269
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,420
Asia the Invincible,

270
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,860
the most prominent among
the brothels of the 13 provinces.

271
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,820
They're all bought by me.

272
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,020
Asia the Invincible is just a name.

273
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,460
I can call myself
Asia the Invincible too.

274
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,620
Come on, call one.

275
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,740
Versatility, a full unity
of the world of martial arts.

276
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,460
Hurrah, General Tin!

277
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,300
Sing a song, with bureaucratic tone

278
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:47,220
"Versatility, a full unity
of the world of martial arts,"

279
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,700
"Asia the Invincible."

280
00:22:50,820 --> 00:23:03,060
"Hurrah! Hurrah, General Tin!"

281
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,340
Sing like this, then I will leave
a good reputation for generations

282
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,860
I also know the Kung-fu of
Asia the Invincible's flying needles.

283
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,540
Let me show you.

284
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,420
Bingo!

285
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,260
Good! I'm great!

286
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,660
- Snow!
- What?

287
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,740
Tin.

288
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,060
I just want to check her wound.

289
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,700
She is my woman.

290
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,220
I won't let anyone touch her.

291
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,980
Yes, it's not decent
to fool other's wife.

292
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,540
She is seriously hurt.

293
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,500
Here is not a good place,

294
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,140
you had better
take a rest in my camp.

295
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,940
It's not convenient for us
to stay in the camp with you.

296
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,380
Not easy?

297
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,980
Let me go out,
so you can sleep with her.

298
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,180
- Man!
- Yes.

299
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,860
- Take these two guests for a rest.
- Yes.

300
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,980
it seems to me that
I can only sleep...

301
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,860
with my Asia the invincible tonight.

302
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,380
Am I your woman?

303
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,060
Light more!

304
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,020
It's funny!

305
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,580
How wonderful is it.

306
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,740
Give me the wine.

307
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,700
Oh shit! Asia the Invincible?

308
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,420
Versatility, a full unity
of the world of Martial Arts!

309
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,700
Unbeaten! General Tin!

310
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,660
Brother Koo.

311
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,060
Brother Kai Wan, something a
gentleman should do but something not.

312
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,180
We should not argue for a woman!

313
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,940
We can do nothing
once get involved in a war.

314
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,860
Koo, you said I was your woman.

315
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,780
Now, how can you settle it?

316
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,300
Well... Take care of yourself.

317
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,620
He asked me to take care of myself.

318
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,540
We'll, let's take care.
Go to the camp now.

319
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,100
Okay.

320
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,860
But I've to dress up as
Asia the Invincible first.

321
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,060
You want to be Asia the Invincible?
Good!

322
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,860
I've stop your valve remotely.

323
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,100
I don't want you to pretend
to Asia the invincible anymore,

324
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,620
so I must take you away.

325
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,860
You lie down so quickly!
My dear Asia the Invincible!

326
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,260
Bingo!

327
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,860
Dismiss!

328
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,020
- Bingo!
- Dismiss.

329
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,220
Bingo!

330
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,260
Shit! You're touched
my laughing valve!

331
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,540
Watch out!

332
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,540
Go away!

333
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Can't you see that I am
playing games with General Tin?

334
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,100
Help me.

335
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,300
Dismiss!

336
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,420
Bingo!

337
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,540
Your laughing valve
is attacked again.

338
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,940
Brother Tin, Brother Tin, hold on.

339
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,540
It's nonsense,
let's play something else.

340
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,060
You listen,
we'll play something else.

341
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,420
We'll rehearse the declaration of
war on Asia the Invincible tomorrow.

342
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,500
But you'd better call me
Asia the Invincible now.

343
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,860
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts! Come on!

344
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,780
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts!

345
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,820
Unbeaten! Asia the Invincible!

346
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,220
Officer Koo, Hurrah! Hurrah!

347
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,220
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts.

348
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,100
Unbeaten! Asia the Invincible!

349
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,660
Officer Koo, Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

350
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,780
We can't escape from the war.

351
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,860
Even we're going to die. I want to
die by the side of Asia the Invincible.

352
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
Thank you for let me go.

353
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,300
Snow, you go and look for
Asia the Invincible now.

354
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,100
But, I don't want to
see you again in the battlefield.

355
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,540
What's the matter?

356
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,100
Chin, are you crazy?

357
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,340
I don't want you to become
another Asia the invincible.

358
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,340
When I am lonely.

359
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,060
I hope a fried to accompany me.

360
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,940
We can get him back to Black Cliff.

361
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,620
Then we should
find ways to defeat her.

362
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,580
The Spanish, are you still
looking for the Sacred Scroll?

363
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,860
Who are you?

364
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,740
Do you know
where's the Sacred Scroll?

365
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,460
You've asked the correct person!
I am Asia the Invincible.

366
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,740
Asia the Invincible?

367
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,500
You are powerful because of this?

368
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,780
Your science. Is shit.

369
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,940
Armour?

370
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,900
What power did your God give you?

371
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,460
This is our holy cup.

372
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,100
Your God is useless!

373
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,540
Kneel down!

374
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,740
Your Bible should be re-written.

375
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,180
From now on.

376
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,820
The God mentioned
in your western Bible...

377
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,420
Should be re-written
as Asia the Invincible.

378
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,260
Come on, let's in prayer.

379
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:17,540
Holy Asia the Invincible,
Holy Asia the Invincible.

380
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,980
Hand the flag of the
Sun Moon Sect at the bow.

381
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,660
- Keep on temping Asia the Invincible.
- Yes, Sir!

382
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,620
Anything special?

383
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,940
Nothing.

384
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,740
General Mo Yan Lu Chong, Liu Seng

385
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,940
And all other Japanese ninjas.

386
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,180
We are get ready to fight.

387
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,980
Let's go!

388
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Today, I want to show you something,

389
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,420
which you've never seen before,
that's my real face.

390
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,020
Look!

391
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Are you surprised?

392
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,940
Can you imagine the
invincible General Mo Yan Lu Chong,

393
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,740
is a hooker in the camp
of the wanderers?

394
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,980
You must be having some bad feeling.

395
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,020
Since you have been
deceived for a long time.

396
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,780
You don't know...

397
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,060
who is the master behind.

398
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,500
Let me tell you.

399
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,460
The real name of Mo Yan Lu Chong
is Asia the Invincible.

400
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,420
I have got the military order.

401
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,260
Who goes against me should be killed.

402
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,780
Attention.

403
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,420
Let's go ahead.
We'll join with the Spanish warship...

404
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,660
to unite the world.

405
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,540
Since the people can't forget me.

406
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,980
I'll lead the troops
to declare war again.

407
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,100
I will change my name to
"Asia and Europe the Invincible".

408
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,140
- Raise the banner.
- Yes!

409
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,180
"Asia and Europe the invincible"

410
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,460
Sir, a warship is found ahead.

411
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,180
This is the Mo Yan
warship of the Japanese.

412
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,580
Sir,

413
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,940
the Japanese and the Spanish warship

414
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,500
raised their banners.

415
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,100
They declare war on us.

416
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,180
What?

417
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,460
It's strange, why do the
Japanese and the Spanish...

418
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,260
declare war on us?

419
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,220
Raise our flag and declare war.

420
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,420
"Koo"

421
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,860
Fire.

422
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,300
Report, Koo's banner is hanging on
the warship of Ming Dynasty.

423
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,020
Fire to them to show our trench!
Declare war now.

424
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,700
Koo's banner.

425
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,060
It's Koo!

426
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,660
Instruct the Spanish warship
to attack the warship of Ming Dynasty.

427
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,780
- Check the ship!
- Yes!

428
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,500
Koo, you are great!

429
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,980
Fine, let's sink into the water.

430
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,380
Sir,

431
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,020
the Japanese ship
disappears suddenly.

432
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,460
It's a submarine.

433
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,500
Bet there is much undercurrent here.

434
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,620
If they sail below the sea,

435
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,820
their route will be hindered.

436
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,620
That's what I want.

437
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,660
Pour the paint into the water
to disturb their view.

438
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,700
Yes. Execute now!

439
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,940
Sir, our route is hindered
by the submerged rocks.

440
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,580
The Ming Dynasty Navy
poured the paints into the sea.

441
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Visibility is poor, we can't move.

442
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,820
You want to trap us
at the bottom of the sea?

443
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,620
Fine, bomb the submerged rocks
with the mine.

444
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,900
Yes.

445
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,260
Report, the Spanish warship
is approaching us in full speed.

446
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,180
it seems that they want to crash
against us, please give instruction.

447
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
- Lower the sail.
- Lower the sail in full speed.

448
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,980
Yes!

449
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,460
Lower the sail.

450
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,620
Get ready the war.

451
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,940
Koo, you have been
exhausted in the fighting.

452
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,980
Asia the Invincible
hasn't shown up yet.

453
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,180
Chin, I tell you.

454
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,500
The wish of everybody,

455
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,220
is to meet the strongest enemy
before his death.

456
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,500
If he were the leader of the enemy.

457
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,980
It's too early to say
who'll be the winner.

458
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,940
Report,
the body of the ship is damaged.

459
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,460
We'd emerge from the sea at once.

460
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,420
Koo must be waiting for me.

461
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,300
Well, let's go up.

462
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,820
Asia the Invincible!

463
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,860
Focus the top of their sail.

464
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,540
Asia the Invincible,
you show up eventually.

465
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,860
Get ready the cannon!

466
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,780
Asia the Invincible?

467
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,500
But you are not better than me
at leading the troops.

468
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,380
You've got the magic power
from "Sacred Scroll".

469
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,260
Although this is
your personal achievement,

470
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,220
it can't make you
achieve great success.

471
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,940
That's why your troops didn't attack,

472
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,060
but were destroyed
at the Black Cliff.

473
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Bull shit!

474
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,380
My failure was caused
by my foe whom I admired.

475
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,500
I didn't want to hurt him,

476
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,140
thus I pretended that
I was kill Dundee the cliff.

477
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,140
Last time, you could escape
because of the "Sacred Scroll".

478
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,380
Now, the history is repeated.

479
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,380
If you had not had the luck
to adopt the "Sacred Scroll",

480
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,340
you'd not have escaped
from my attack.

481
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,540
You're qualified to be
a great martial arts master only.

482
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,900
But being a king or a great general,

483
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,380
You are not qualified
to be named a sassier the Invincible.

484
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,020
I want to be king, I have to recruit
a great general first.

485
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,620
I want you to be my general,
so I will show you my power.

486
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,220
If I had practiced the Sacred Scroll.

487
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,700
You'd not have defeated me.

488
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,900
Anyway, our fight
should have been over.

489
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,660
You're wrong!
Our fight has not been over yet.

490
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,420
Give it to me.

491
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,460
It's too easy to defeat you.

492
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,100
Your 14 valves
are both live and dead.

493
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,060
Let me open your closed valves.

494
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,860
Your Kung fu will be improved greatly,

495
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,100
so you are able to fight with me.

496
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,940
Koo, watch it.

497
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,740
Snow, I said...

498
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,900
I didn't hope to see you
in the battlefield again.

499
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,740
I want to see Asia the Invincible.

500
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,380
Snow!

501
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,980
Snow, I will save you.

502
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,340
Only Asia the invincible can save me.

503
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,580
Snow, come back to me now.

504
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,860
Holy Master.

505
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,620
Do you think it's worth doing it?

506
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,620
I have waited for this moment.

507
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,980
I know you come for me.

508
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,260
Koo, get lost.

509
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,860
Koo, return Snow to me.

510
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,420
I won't return her to you.

511
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,740
Come to get her yourself.

512
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,140
Asia the Invincible,
you are always alone.

513
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,860
Why do you follow me?

514
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,100
Don't go!

515
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,580
Snow, no matter how,

516
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,340
I have to take you back.

517
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,500
But what a pity that,
you could never hear what he said.

518
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,540
Otherwise, you'd be very happy.

519
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,980
Hand her to me.

520
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,860
Asia the Invincible,
it's useless for anything you said.

521
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,420
She could never hear you.

522
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,180
You are lying!

523
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,420
You have never trusted anybody.

524
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,220
You've made it.

525
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,700
But you have got no one
to stay with you.

526
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,940
Asia the Invincible, you always
want to search for yourself.

527
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,780
Actually, what you have done,

528
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,700
either good or bad, that's you.

529
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,300
I don't need you to tell me.

530
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,140
What a pity that, you are always
making remedy to what you've lost.

531
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,940
But, you never treasure
the things you've gained.

532
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,780
I want you to lose
what you have gained.

533
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,660
Well, but I want her back now.

534
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:10,100
Snow. Let's start
from the very beginning.

535
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,020
Asia the Invincible.
