1
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,938
Report to Holy Master,

2
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:58,298
the Government is allied with the
Dutch Navy. They come to attack us.

3
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:00,938
Treat them the bomb.

4
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:06,938
How dare you!

5
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:12,618
Asia the Invincible
gathered 30,000 soldiers.

6
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,058
They are ready to fight to the North.

7
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:17,938
it seems that,
he is planning to rebel.

8
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:23,938
'To unite the world of martial arts.'

9
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:27,018
'Long life to the Sun moon Sect.'

10
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:32,978
Long life to our Holy Master,
Asia the Invincible.

11
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:36,098
Holy Master,

12
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:38,698
Wu is leading some swordsmen
to the Black Cliff.

13
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:40,898
They are approaching the palace.

14
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:44,578
They can do nothing to me!

15
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:45,818
They are here.

16
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:50,658
Kill Asia the Invincible.

17
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,618
Wu.

18
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:09,978
They killing Hook.

19
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:17,298
Watch my needles.

20
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,338
Ling!

21
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:43,458
Essence absorbing stance!

22
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:19,018
- I won't give you any shelter.
- Watch my Wonder Swords.

23
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:22,778
Who will you save first?

24
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,218
Asia the Invincible.

25
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,298
I will never tell you.

26
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:36,658
I want you to remember me
and regret for your whole life.

27
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,818
"Ming Dynasty, Wan Li Year 33"

28
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:34,338
That's the flag of
Asia the Invincible.

29
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:36,258
In the past,

30
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,618
The demon and his army
were destroyed here.

31
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:50,058
Yes, how can you imagine that
after his death,

32
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:54,698
the Black Cliff is still full of
arrogant and haunted atmosphere.

33
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,178
I can feel...
Asia the Invincible hasn't died.

34
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:08,018
This must be the Black Cliff.

35
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:10,658
Right, according to the report
of the Chinese officers,

36
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:14,618
This sailing route is leading
to the Black Cliff.

37
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:19,298
Officer Koo, isn't it
the base of Asia the Invincible?

38
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:20,978
General Golida,

39
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,938
Asia the Invincible
sank the Dutch warship...

40
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:25,978
right here?

41
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,258
Is Asia the Invincible
that horrible...

42
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:30,578
as you have mentioned?

43
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,418
The world of Han's martial arts
is hard to predict and understand.

44
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,018
There are many rumors in the world,
no matter they are true or not.

45
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,138
I do want to learn about it.

46
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:02,178
Brother Koo, we are ordered
to lead the Spanish here,

47
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,618
The purpose is to find the goods
from the sunken Dutch ship.

48
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,738
Why should we go up
to the Black Cliff?

49
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:11,298
I think Golida's intention is not
only the stuff from the sunken ship.

50
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,138
What are they doing?

51
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,858
They are having a sacrifice.

52
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:23,338
I believe they're scared of the evil
and would like to drive it away.

53
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:25,218
If they are so scared,
why do they still insist to go up?

54
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:28,818
yes, should we ask them why?

55
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:32,618
Golida said he was curious
about the Black Cliff.

56
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,178
In fact, me too.

57
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:39,058
Asia the Invincible was a name
of astonishment in the past.

58
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,058
Here, the Black Cliff, is his base.

59
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:45,938
Curious? What made you curious?

60
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:47,978
- Chin, Ling.
- Yes Sir.

61
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,618
You stay behind, I am going up first.

62
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,498
Woo, he can fly!

63
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:01,058
This is some sort of kung-fu
in our world of martial arts.

64
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,338
What is the world of martial arts?

65
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,698
it isn't a name of a place.

66
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,978
We called the place where swordsmen
gather the "World of Martial Arts."

67
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,898
So what is the place
where swordsmen gather?

68
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:15,978
Well, the place where
swordsmen live...

69
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,058
That's the place where
the swordsmen living around.

70
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:20,458
We just call it
the world of martial arts.

71
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:22,418
We are far behind, let's go.

72
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:24,898
Do you understand
what he has mentioned?

73
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:28,218
You are good at Han's dialects.
Don't you understand?

74
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:30,018
Sure I do.

75
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:33,618
Okay, let's go to
the world of martial arts.

76
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:50,098
The Notorious Evil:
Asia the Invincible.

77
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,218
Wu!

78
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:53,738
Who?

79
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:12,458
Asia the Invincible, if your soul
wants to see me, come out.

80
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:20,538
But you are already dead.

81
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:25,378
Why should you mention
the history again?

82
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:35,338
Stay calm,
there is something strange.

83
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:40,098
This is a land of souls
and evil spirits.

84
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:44,658
It's not wise of the living people
to visit here. You'd better leave.

85
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:47,738
Who are you? Human or devil?

86
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:16,858
Don't get mad, don't shoot.

87
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:36,138
The Black Cliff hasn't been
so busy for a long time.

88
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:40,458
I am the warden of this Holy Altar
for 3 generations.

89
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:44,098
I have seen the ups and downs
of the masters.

90
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:47,458
Asia the Invincible
misleader our Sect,

91
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,018
death is his only end!

92
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:53,898
You mean Asia Invincible is dead?

93
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:57,858
What? Hasn't he died?

94
00:10:58,138 --> 00:11:00,378
Don't be afraid.

95
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,858
Impossible!

96
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,658
His corpse fell down
to the cliff together...

97
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:06,658
with his powerful kung-fu.

98
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,698
Just over there.

99
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,258
Would you take me there?

100
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:22,858
Go.

101
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:38,978
This is the grave of
Asia the Invincible.

102
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:43,218
Asia the Invincible.

103
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:48,658
Asia the Invincible!

104
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,258
Thank God,
this demon is locked right here.

105
00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:58,418
I can't totally believe
that he is dead,

106
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:00,018
Why?

107
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:03,018
The only way to prove
he is dead or not,

108
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,538
I to look at his corpse.

109
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:08,338
Brother Koo,
do you want to dig his grave?

110
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,418
Maybe there is nothing inside.

111
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,618
Let me do it.

112
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:21,698
General Golida.

113
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,418
look at the corpse,

114
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:46,138
these are what left
by the notorious demon.

115
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:50,538
What he has left the world
is a notorious name.

116
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:54,178
The Notorious Demon:
Asia the Invincible.

117
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:02,138
What are you looking for?

118
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:03,658
I've spent great effort,

119
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,258
come here from afar,
only for one thing.

120
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:06,098
Don't stop me.

121
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,138
What are you searching?

122
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:09,098
His Sacred Scroll

123
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:10,698
If this is his dead body

124
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:12,298
I've heard that his mysterious
kung-fu came from the Sacred Scroll.

125
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,018
General Golida,

126
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:17,338
I am ordered to take you here
for the sunken ship.

127
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,978
But not for the Sacred Scroll.

128
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:25,218
You fool!
If I didn't use this excuse,

129
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:28,258
Your Majesty wouldn't
have been deceived.

130
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:30,218
And you wouldn't
have taken me here...

131
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:31,818
to find the thing I wanted

132
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,818
Koo.

133
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,578
You got mysterious Kung-fu,
I got science.

134
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:50,538
Asia the Invincible is a legend.

135
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:52,978
Now, he was buried underground.

136
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:56,218
We Hans have a saying,
"Respect the Heroes".

137
00:13:56,338 --> 00:13:58,178
Even you don't respect him,

138
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,218
you'd give him some face.

139
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,698
You can't insult his skeleton.

140
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,658
We sail for treasure
is the funniest thing.

141
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,218
You can't even explain clearly
what the world of martial arts is!

142
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,058
If I can't get the Sacred Scroll,
it will be with you.

143
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:12,258
Golida,

144
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:14,458
if I let you touch the body
of Asia the Invincible,

145
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:17,218
Koo will have
a notorious name forever.

146
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,418
Get lost.

147
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,618
You have science,
I have mysterious Kung-fu.

148
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:37,978
You do despise the warden
of the Sun Moon Sect!

149
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,138
Take it back!

150
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:45,778
Follow me.

151
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:50,858
Let's go for Koo.

152
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,138
Thank you for saving my life.

153
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:03,178
A courtier tried hard
to protect a grave.

154
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,058
You are appreciated.

155
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:13,018
- Wine can stop pain.
- Thank you!

156
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:19,738
Not many people in the world
appreciate good win.

157
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:22,098
But I won't believe your identity.

158
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:26,698
Because I can tell,
you are Asia the Invincible.

159
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:29,938
What made you suspect me
to be Asia the Invincible?

160
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:33,498
I know pretty well about
the history of the Sun Moon Sect.

161
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:34,778
Since you are the warden,
and you have great power,

162
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:36,698
Asia the Invincible and Wu had
many severe fights among themselves.

163
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,298
They won't allow you,
such a guy to stay in his Sect.

164
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:39,578
Besides,
you're so skilled in kung-fu.

165
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:41,178
Why you are not renowned?

166
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:43,258
So, Asia the Invincible
is still alive.

167
00:15:43,698 --> 00:15:45,018
You are Asia the Invincible!

168
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,738
If I were Asia the Invincible,

169
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,658
then you would not leave here alive.

170
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,058
I won't mind being killed,

171
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:51,938
that's my wish!

172
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:58,058
Don't you feel regret
to see Asia the Invincible?

173
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,618
Why should I regret
if my wish come true.

174
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:04,978
Okay, I will make
your wish come true.

175
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:21,218
Koo, 14 of your valves
has been closed by me,

176
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:22,818
you're dying.

177
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:26,578
Just because I have found out
you're Asia the Invincible?

178
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,018
That's what I presumed.

179
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:32,298
Asia the Invincible,
since you want to kill me.

180
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:34,498
You should keep your promise.

181
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:37,778
Let me see your real face.

182
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,218
Does if worth?

183
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:42,218
It's the fact, why do you
still ask this silly question?

184
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:44,058
Fine!

185
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:59,058
Koo, does it worth
dying for a glance of me?

186
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:01,298
Sure!

187
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:05,898
- Your are the big fool of the world!
- Wait!

188
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:07,818
Are you scared?

189
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:09,058
Don't you think no one knows...

190
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,418
you are hiding at the Black Cliff?

191
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:11,498
Do you know how many
Asia the Invincible...

192
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,338
are there in the world?

193
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:15,978
Although you hide yourself,

194
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,138
there're still many
Asia the Invincible.

195
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:20,058
Bull shit!

196
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,938
You close my valves, because
you don't want me to die so quickly!

197
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,618
You cunning guy, I want you
to feed the fishes with your body.

198
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:55,818
Are there many fake
Asia the Invincible?

199
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:57,898
Right, after you missing,

200
00:17:58,018 --> 00:17:59,818
Many people tried to rule
over the world in the name of you.

201
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,618
Although you feel regret
under the Black Cliff,

202
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:05,898
Many Asia the Invincible
are still fighting for power.

203
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:08,658
You didn't kill, but many
innocent people died because of you.

204
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:19,298
What a troubled world.

205
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,698
Koo, since my name
is still a disaster.

206
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,258
Take me to stop the
fake Asia the Invincible.

207
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:46,458
I can do that,
but you must promise me.

208
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,538
Never kill again.

209
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:53,298
Good!

210
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,578
If you disclose my identity,

211
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:01,338
I'll kill not only
the innocent people, but you too.

212
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:08,218
Let's go for the
fake Asia the Invincible.

213
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,018
A ship is coming!

214
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:26,578
Be alert!

215
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,578
Be alert!

216
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:37,018
Report to our Holy Master.

217
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:38,818
We've discover that
a ship is approaching us.

218
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:09,218
Mo Yan Lu Chong.
Are your goods ready?

219
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:11,338
I have brought you the gold.

220
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,018
30000 guns, 100 cannons,

221
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,698
8000 baskets of gunpowder.

222
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:22,458
Our ship is dangerous under the sun.

223
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:24,298
If not cool it with water.

224
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:26,858
Our ship will explode any time.

225
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:29,698
Mo Yan Lu Chong,

226
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:31,778
you know sound transmission too.

227
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,738
But you are exaggerating.

228
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:37,018
How can you cool
such a big ship with water?

229
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,698
Asia the Invincible, but you are
more exaggerating than me.

230
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,978
My ship left Japan 8 years ago.

231
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:45,338
But I am always well informed

232
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,058
According to the report of my ninjas.

233
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:49,618
Asia the invincible died
4 months ago...

234
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,458
at the Black Cliff.

235
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:53,658
If this is the fact,

236
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,618
you are not Asia the Invincible.

237
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:58,458
It's lousy trick!

238
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:02,778
The Japanese ninja!

239
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:22,018
How can you fool me?

240
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:23,498
Raise.

241
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:31,298
I, Mo Yan Lo Chong is coming.

242
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,418
I will let your fellows
to fight with you.

243
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:39,538
Watch my sword!

244
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:44,858
- Come here.
- Master!

245
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,338
Try my Iron Balls.

246
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,138
Watch out!

247
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,338
A Japanese ninja is nothing special.

248
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:50,058
I sank down into the sea.

249
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:17,338
Turn to the East,
get ready the cannon.

250
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:20,858
Fire!

251
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:33,818
Dai, I want you tonight.

252
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:51,338
The opium is the tribute
from Ryukyu Islands.

253
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:56,018
Such precious thing should be
shared with our Holy Master.

254
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,058
Holy Master.

255
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:22,898
I haven't slept with you since
you've been my concubine,

256
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,458
do you know why?

257
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:26,218
I don't know.

258
00:27:26,338 --> 00:27:27,858
I suspect that you are a man.

259
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:33,058
look, he is the betrayer!

260
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:35,458
The Japanese ninja...

261
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:38,418
is really great!

262
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:52,138
When did you find out I am a ninja?

263
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:53,338
Because when you looked at me.

264
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,498
Your eyes are different
from other concubines.

265
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,978
But why don't you
take action earlier?

266
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:01,258
I want you to tell me
how to trace Mo Yan Lu Chong.

267
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:48,778
Pigeon!

268
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,218
I need this to find Mo Yan Lu Chong.

269
00:28:59,178 --> 00:28:59,858
What are you crying?

270
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:02,218
The one you loved
is right in front of you.

271
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:10,258
But, how about my lover?
Where are you?

272
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:29,178
Koo, you are quite good at flying.

273
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:31,578
You are still capable
to follow me after an hour.

274
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:33,938
But still I can't get ahead of you.

275
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:37,938
Do you want to?

276
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:06,578
The universe is endless,
the stars are bright.

277
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:12,618
The sun rises from the East,
I an the Invincible!

278
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:18,138
The universe is endless,
the stars are bright.

279
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:24,298
The sun rises from the East,
I an the Invincible!

280
00:30:24,418 --> 00:30:27,218
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible.

281
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:30,698
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible.

282
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:33,138
Please honor me
the light of thousand generations.

283
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,778
Please honor me
the light of thousand generations.

284
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,538
Asia the Invincible
is just a normal guy.

285
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:42,218
Somehow he is worshipped as God.

286
00:30:42,418 --> 00:30:45,298
People do not really understand
Asia the Invincible.

287
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,938
They don't need to understand
Asia the Invincible.

288
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:53,058
They only want...

289
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:57,738
Asia the Invincible, our Holy Master.

290
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:01,498
Burn me to death!

291
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:05,058
I am willing to die for you!
Hurry up.

292
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:07,018
Oh, Blood Sacrifice.

293
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:09,458
Hurry up!

294
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:17,258
Who are you? Why are you here?

295
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:19,178
What you are worshipping,

296
00:31:19,258 --> 00:31:21,778
Is in fact the origin of evils.

297
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:25,178
Do you know it?
Why do you worship him?

298
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:27,978
Who are you?

299
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:29,818
You can't insult our Holy Master.

300
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:31,418
Holy Master?

301
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:37,298
You abuse the name of Asia the
Invincible to fool these Highlanders.

302
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,178
Do you want to offend him?

303
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,378
I an designated by
Asia the Invincible!

304
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,898
I rule over them according
to the will of Asia the Invincible.

305
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,618
Bull shit!

306
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,098
You haven't seen the
real Asia the Invincible.

307
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:51,418
You will be punished.

308
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:54,178
Only me who can communicate
with Asia the Invincible.

309
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:57,898
If you insult me, you are
insulting Asia the invincible.

310
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,258
Do you know who I am?

311
00:31:59,338 --> 00:32:00,658
Tell me, who are you?

312
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:02,178
Who exactly are you?

313
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:05,298
How dare you talk to me like that!

314
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:13,978
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible!

315
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,978
What power has Asia the Invincible
evincible given you?

316
00:32:17,178 --> 00:32:19,578
There are continuous
disasters in Highland.

317
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:21,258
The government is oppressing us.

318
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:23,698
Only Asia the Invincible
can protect us.

319
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:28,618
Foolish! I will kill those
who keep on worshipping me.

320
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:32,058
Because I am the real
Asia the Invincible.

321
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:34,178
Bull shit!

322
00:32:35,418 --> 00:32:37,178
You believe the fake one
but not the true one.

323
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:48,738
Now you should
believe in what I said?

324
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:51,098
We can't surrender, I want to
devote my heart to the Holy Master!

325
00:32:51,218 --> 00:32:52,458
We can't surrender!

326
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:54,658
If you want to devote your heart,
dig it out now.

327
00:32:55,698 --> 00:32:58,018
No one can affect our love
towards the Holy Master.

328
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:04,578
Who suspects, who is going
against Asia the Invincible!

329
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:07,658
Do you see our strength now?

330
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,058
You want Asia the Invincible,

331
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,178
I will give you Asia the Invincible.

332
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,418
Give me your hearts.

333
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:25,778
Stop murdering!

334
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,818
Asia the Invincible! You promised me
that you wouldn't kill.

335
00:33:38,178 --> 00:33:40,698
What the hell are you? It's the
business of the Highlanders.

336
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,698
There is nothing to do
with the government officials.

337
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:47,258
I had said, who disclose me,
who should be killed.

338
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:48,738
It's you who disclose yourself,

339
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,098
not me.

340
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:52,898
If you want to kill me,
not a reason is needed!

341
00:34:03,098 --> 00:34:05,538
I want the whole world
to hate Asia the Invincible.

342
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:07,258
I want to slaughter...

343
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:09,618
those fake Asia the Invincible!

344
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,618
Is this the logo
of the Sun Moon Sect?

345
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:05,818
I am the government officials,
who dares cuff me?

346
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,178
Shut up!

347
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:10,298
Tell me how many government
officials are there?

348
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:12,658
Tell me, so I will keep you
a complete corpse.

349
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,298
Asia the Invincible?

350
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:25,058
Another Asia the Invincible.

351
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:26,658
How dare a little dog tease me?

352
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:29,778
I want to make your mouth shut,
let's see how you laugh again!

353
00:35:34,378 --> 00:35:36,098
I think you wouldn't mind
somebody tease you.

354
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,618
The real Asia the Invincible
doesn't want to admit his identity.

355
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,298
And you, try every means to claim
yourselves to be Asia the Invincible.

356
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:44,458
I don't know you real identity.

357
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:48,298
But, the kung-fu of Asia the
Invincible came from the Sacred Scroll.

358
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:49,018
Show us the Sacred Scroll...

359
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:51,418
to prove yourself the
real Asia the invincible.

360
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:55,058
You fat-headed, since there are
so many fake Asia the Invincible.

361
00:35:55,218 --> 00:35:57,258
There will be fake Sacred Scroll!

362
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:04,818
Let's see how long can you stand.

363
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:08,298
broken!

364
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,618
- Brother Ko.
- Officer Koo!

365
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:24,378
You are here!

366
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:27,258
We were caught
when hiding form the Spanish.

367
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:29,058
look!

368
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:33,938
- The Navy of Ming Dynasty!
- The arms of our government.

369
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:38,338
Right!
We bought these from the navy...

370
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:39,618
who stole the arms from their camps.

371
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:42,458
That's why it will soon be
the end of your dynasty soon.

372
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:43,698
I know your warships are coming...

373
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:45,378
South to go against us.

374
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:46,778
During our fight.

375
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:48,218
I will hang you up.

376
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:50,498
Let's wait and
see your dog face then!

377
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:04,178
It's useless,
we've tried this before.

378
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,858
This is our chance to survive.

379
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:20,978
Stay back.

380
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:31,218
Don't move, once they are in a mess.

381
00:37:31,298 --> 00:37:34,058
The nearby navy camp
will hear the explosion.

382
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:36,258
At that moment,

383
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:39,738
we can get rid of all
fake Asia the Invincible.

384
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:51,618
How smart is your fat-head.

385
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:55,698
Officer, is that your trick?

386
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:58,378
You want to keep my life not because
you want me to cover you.

387
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:01,458
Because you want to know where is
the real Asia the Invincible.

388
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:04,098
You are afraid that
he will show up anytime.

389
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:10,858
Why did you say
that's the real Asia the Invincible?

390
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:13,978
It's useless to kill them!

391
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:17,138
It's not necessary for me
to tell you, he will show up soon.

392
00:38:19,178 --> 00:38:20,618
Don't worry, he will come to you.

393
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:22,978
You are so anxious
to know he is real or not.

394
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:31,658
Sure your purpose is to find out
the real Asia the Invincible.

395
00:38:32,258 --> 00:38:34,018
Have you waited him for a long time?

396
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:49,138
They are not
at the front of the ship.

397
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,698
Report to our Holy Master.

398
00:38:50,818 --> 00:38:53,338
We've searched everywhere, but we
can't locate the sound of the flute.

399
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:56,298
We can't tell
where the sound comes from.

400
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:12,218
It's always like he finds others.

401
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:14,378
No one could find him out.

402
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:16,338
Here he comes.

403
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:19,298
It's we who leaded him here,

404
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:23,378
how can we send him back?

405
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,778
Raise the logo of our Sun Moon Sect.
Greet our honorable guest.

406
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:47,898
You return finally.

407
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:58,778
- Snow!
- I can hear you calling my name.

408
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:02,138
My coming here is not for you.

409
00:40:02,218 --> 00:40:03,458
Then why did you come?

410
00:40:03,578 --> 00:40:05,338
I came here for burying everything.

411
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:14,218
Forget Asia the Invincible.

412
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,138
The ship ran aground.

413
00:40:30,618 --> 00:40:32,338
Sir, the gate of the prison
is ruined.

414
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:34,218
Okay, rush out!

415
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:46,138
Go to the head of the ship now.

416
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:53,698
To stop Asia the Invincible
destroying this ship again.

417
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:56,058
Catch it.

418
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:57,898
Take it back!

419
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:20,378
Asia the Invincible.

420
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:33,858
Holy Master.

421
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:36,618
Koo,

422
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:38,898
I have killed many
fake Asia the Invincible.

423
00:41:38,978 --> 00:41:40,938
Asia the Invincible,
you are always superior.

424
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,418
But this is your Sun Moon Sect.

425
00:41:42,538 --> 00:41:44,458
Stop another massacre please.

426
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:48,018
Koo, I want you to see how I return
to the world of martial arts.

427
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,498
And I want you to see my massacre
in the world of martial arts.

428
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:56,258
I am wrong. My holy Master

429
00:41:56,658 --> 00:42:00,378
I lead the Sect in the name of you.

430
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:02,618
Because I am waiting for your return.

431
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:06,738
To let you lead us again,
and establish our own kingdom.

432
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:09,058
On your knees.

433
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:12,498
On your knees. Hurry up.

434
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:16,338
He is the real Asia the Invincible.

435
00:42:19,818 --> 00:42:24,618
Snow, let bygones be bygones.

436
00:42:24,698 --> 00:42:28,098
Master, I won't
let you leave me again.

437
00:42:28,258 --> 00:42:29,778
I am a notorious demon.

438
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:31,658
I will go my own way.

439
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:35,978
Whenever you go, I will follow you.

440
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:38,018
You want to bother me?

441
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,338
If you want to follow me,
I will break your legs and hands.

442
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:46,578
Stop.

443
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:51,738
Just leave,
what do you want to proof?

444
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:54,698
None of your business.

445
00:43:13,538 --> 00:43:18,218
You are my woman indeed.
You don't scare of death!

446
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:23,218
Death is not horrible. It's really
a great pain for one to live alone.

447
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:24,658
Okay, I will leave you,
the rubbish to be alive.

448
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:26,578
I want you to be painful forever.

449
00:43:30,418 --> 00:43:32,338
Why do you hurt
the one who cares for you?

450
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:35,258
I don't need others concern,

451
00:43:35,618 --> 00:43:37,858
what I want is the hatred of yours.

452
00:43:39,938 --> 00:43:43,378
On your knees.
He is the real Asia the Invincible.

453
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:47,738
The powerful Su Moon Sect.

454
00:43:47,898 --> 00:43:50,938
To unite the world.

455
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:55,418
Long life to our Holy Master.

456
00:43:57,338 --> 00:44:01,298
Asia the Invincible,
the Sun Moon Sect.

457
00:44:01,578 --> 00:44:03,938
Those who are longing for my return,
I tell you!

458
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,018
History can be changed!

459
00:44:12,938 --> 00:44:15,458
Is Asia the Invincible so horrible!

460
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:20,098
This disaster will begin
from this ship.

461
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:22,818
And it will spread over
the whole world of martial arts.

462
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:31,498
Why do you still trust in
Asia the invincible?

463
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:33,658
he had abandoned you.

464
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:38,538
You'd better stop the wandering life.

465
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:40,978
Why don't you surrender
and join our court?

466
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:44,018
How ridiculous!
We always rule ourselves.

467
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:47,098
Who do you think you are? Damn it.

468
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,458
If not for Snow.

469
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:50,258
Our Holy Master won't abandon us.

470
00:44:50,378 --> 00:44:51,218
That's right!

471
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:54,098
Snow, you deceived us.

472
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:56,498
You are the sinner of our Sect.

473
00:44:56,578 --> 00:44:58,538
Snow, you sinner!

474
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,258
What else do you want to say?

475
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:02,618
Speak up!

476
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:04,418
I have made a deadly sin.

477
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,498
Kill her!

478
00:45:06,978 --> 00:45:08,898
Ching, protect Snow.

479
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:10,538
Kill that 3 damn officers too.

480
00:45:10,618 --> 00:45:12,098
Hang them to death and air dried them.

481
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:13,658
Right, that's a good idea.

482
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:15,418
Send the 3 damn officers to hell!

483
00:45:15,538 --> 00:45:17,138
Execute the law of our Sect.

484
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:31,858
Brother Koo, save Snow now.
