1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,753
"Honesty and Justice for all"

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,114
Court in session!

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,557
They look innocent, but in reality
they may be that vicious Iron Monkey!

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,595
Confess now!

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,433
- Who stole the seal?
- Hand it over!

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,114
Don't act so innocent in front of me.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,589
Your Excellency, I think...

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,956
I'm a kind-hearted official.
I love my citizens.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,679
But you can't be soft
with these guys!

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,120
He sounds familiar to me.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,749
You always say that.
It proves you come from the same class.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,193
You won't confess?

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,430
Then I must teach you a lesson.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,671
Very wise. Give them a warning.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,318
Fox!

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,795
I know it's you.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,997
Give Governor Cheng 30 lashes!

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,030
Sir, it's an order. I can't help it.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,439
Go ahead!

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,837
Enough! Enough!
I have an idea, sir, please...

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,353
Tell me, then.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,909
Get lost!

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,992
Your Excellency,
I hope these documents are sufficient.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,591
You're smart to come up with
this idea in such a short time.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,148
Come here, come on.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,719
Again, Your Excellency?

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,555
Sir...

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,838
It's a shame to see a smart guy
like you wasting away in this place.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,194
Thank you, sir.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,589
I'll deploy you to another province.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,877
- Choose for yourself.
- Choose myself?

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,518
I'll choose a wealthy place.

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,759
I'm going to be rich!

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,511
It's worth being hit.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,319
You return first
and organise my trip.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,549
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,077
- Governor Cheng.
- Yes, sir.

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,840
Open the stores and donate the food
to the public. This will look good.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,717
I'll report to the Emperor.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,033
Thank you, sir.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,634
Go on, open the stores
and hand out the food.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,559
Hurry up.

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,675
Put the food on the cart.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,511
Quickly, we must deliver it.

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,871
Next month, I'll be moving to Canton.
Would you give me some advice, sir?

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,235
As an officer you've observed four
righteous rules and four witty rules.

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,151
The four righteous rules are

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,712
to repay for merits,
to flatter, to liase and to ally.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,069
Anyone who is skilled in applying
these rules will be prosperous.

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,117
And the four witty rules?

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,751
To create discord, to reprobate,
to frame and to set others up.

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,037
How wise you are.
You have my greatest respect.

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,077
You've already learnt how to flatter.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,559
I didn't mean to.

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,399
Just remember
politics is like a dream.

56
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,472
Don't take it too seriously
and you'll be fine.

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,075
Then you'll live long and prosper.

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,553
Prepare the sedan chair
for His Excellency.

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,478
Chiretta, good for blood.

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,879
Ginseng for respiration.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,872
Crocodile to cure catarrh.
Lizard to treat poisoning.

62
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,916
Tin-tsi... tin-tsi...

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,753
You fool! Don't hit me, Dad!

64
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,713
Dad.

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,348
Stick out your tongue.

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,278
Come on, stick out your tongue.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,592
A slight fever.

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,277
Dr Yang isn't here.
I'll give you some medicine.

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,352
If the fever doesn't subside,
come and see Dr Yang.

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,998
Thank you, Miss Ho.

71
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,835
I've borrowed the pills
to raise money for my trip.

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,388
I must save my dad.
I'll repay you in the future.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,955
Thank you.

74
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,672
Thank you for watching.

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,954
Ladies and gentlemen,

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,157
my father and I were separated
and I need money to get home.

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,550
I've no choice but to sell
our secret family life-saving pill.

78
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,675
30 cents each.

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,193
Little master, you helped us before,
now we'll help you.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,998
Get lost!

81
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,038
Your dad hurt us before, kid.
Now it's our turn to hurt you.

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,997
Honest people don't do
sneaky things.

83
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,196
- I'm Wong Fei-hung. And you?
- Chiu Tin Pa.

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,918
Run Wong Fei-hung!

85
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,474
After him!

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,031
Make way!

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,069
You piece of shit!
Bullying a small boy.

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,395
You have no future.

89
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,080
Your mother would rather
have a bun than you.

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,832
- Nice moves. Well done!
- Thank you.

91
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,354
Watch out, hot water!

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,233
Watch out yourself!

93
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,436
You ruined my stuff.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,839
You little bastard!

95
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,389
Turn around.

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,628
Give me that.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
Boss, I'll pay for the damages.

98
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,278
- Enough?
- More than enough.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,915
Too much.

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,796
How come my kung fu is so good?

101
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,194
Wong Fei-hung, you are great...

102
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,793
Do you take students?

103
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,758
I'm not qualified to teach you.
Put me down.

104
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,759
Shut up!

105
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,953
Who is Wong Fei-hung?

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,075
That's me.

107
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,479
That's him.

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,152
A dragon? A worm, more like!

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,753
Call someone bigger than you.

110
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,150
I'm this big. If you want me
to be bigger, wait a few years.

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,754
Challenge me?
I specialise in taming small kids.

112
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,068
You're so powerful.

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,311
If I catch you, you will suffer.

114
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,998
Come and get me. You can't keep up.

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,357
Let's go for a run.

116
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
You're like a lump of wood.
Can't you keep up?

117
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,309
If I can't beat you, I'll retire.

118
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,233
I beat you. Retire.

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,636
He's really retired so quickly?

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,673
That was easy.

121
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,078
- Little worm.
- Crazy nut, another nasty show?

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,036
I've got thick skin.

123
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,796
- Stop talking to him.
- Shut up! He was lucky. Get lost.

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,073
Who hit me?

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,628
A stone.

126
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,918
Fei-hung, get up.

127
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,674
Come on.

128
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,478
Why did you sneak away?

129
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,710
I'm sorry, Auntie.
I wanted to find my dad.

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,189
I'll think of a way. Let's go.

131
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,319
"The Emperor's Royal Officers"

132
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,872
Welcome, Your Excellency.

133
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,599
Summon the Governor.

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,955
Summon the Governor!

135
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,719
Summon me?
Is the investigator back again?

136
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,791
Where does this monk come from?

137
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,668
You dare sit in my chair?
Take him away and close down the temple.

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,513
Why don't you come to greet
the investigator?

139
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,478
You're the investigator?!

140
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,675
Another one.

141
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,194
This time I've got to see
your royal seal.

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,753
My rule is to kill
before investigating.

143
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,755
Is that another note
from Iron Monkey?

144
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,034
We've no money left.

145
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,270
He is the real one.

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,633
Your Excellency.

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,074
So you'll serve me now?

148
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,872
Yes, sir! Wash all the dishes
and prepare a banquet.

149
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,109
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,476
His Excellency would like
some chicken and shark fin.

151
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,556
Of course, of course.

152
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,559
The rod is blind,
it sweeps away all injustice.

153
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,474
Strong force
that switches north and south.

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,553
Fei-hung, your turn.

155
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,354
Seek the way.

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,869
Fisherman's Paddle!

157
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,359
Double Flight from the Sea!

158
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,393
Old Branches on the Ground!

159
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,959
Open Both Up and Down!

160
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,995
Rod that Calms the Central!

161
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,516
- Is he your first apprentice?
- You are the first.

162
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,397
He is your junior.

163
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,074
His dad will fight with you
sooner or later.

164
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,515
I really hope he doesn't come.

165
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,919
If you lose...

166
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
That's why I'm teaching him
how to use the rod.

167
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,351
At least I get a follower.

168
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,997
Come on, Fei-hung.

169
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,389
Dad!

170
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,949
They should meet each other.

171
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,553
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

172
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,153
Still in one piece.

173
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,318
Dad, don't worry.
A man should be dignified.

174
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,675
Fei-hung hasn't made you lose face.

175
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,993
Good. I'm glad you've grown up.
My worries are over.

176
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,348
Thank you for saving my son Fei-hung.

177
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,555
My pleasure.

178
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,629
Please...

179
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,835
Help yourselves.

180
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,633
I heard there were some refugees
coming into town.

181
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,597
Iron Monkey will be around then.

182
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,876
Fei-hung, take this.

183
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Fei-hung! No.

184
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,559
You can't eat roast duck, you're ill.
Let go.

185
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,593
From my diagnosis
he shouldn't eat so much.

186
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,432
You have it, Dr Yang.

187
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,193
You don't need a special diet
with my medicines.

188
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,034
It's better to be safe than sorry.

189
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,953
The Po Chi Lam Clinic prescription
is quite effective.

190
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,237
Fei-hung is still young, his stomach
is too weak to take such greasy food.

191
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,790
Brother Wong, you'd not put it
this way. But there is a basic law.

192
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,034
Since he's just recovered, he has no
appetite. This will give him one.

193
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,714
It doesn't matter what he eats,
as long as he does.

194
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,869
Not at all.

195
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,957
You'll never finish your meal
if you keep arguing.

196
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,995
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,997
"The Government House of Chekiang"

198
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,870
It's nice to be so relaxed about things.
You still have your women...

199
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,356
I'd love to be a monk like you.

200
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,719
What a waste of my talent.

201
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,670
Goodbye sweet ladies.

202
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,190
The dream has faded.

203
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,669
I must get some money
to buy an officer's post.

204
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,349
My last prayers, I can't believe
I have to bury you here.

205
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,079
Bless me
that I won't be tortured in future.

206
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,869
After I've buried you,
I'll have to sell myself.

207
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,397
Protect my future descendants from
such suffering as I've experienced.

208
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,837
You don't have to sell yourself.

209
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,639
Take this money
and bury your husband.

210
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,109
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,758
Dead monkey, I'll bury you!

212
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,349
It's a trap.

213
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,115
Right.

214
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,237
A rich city merchant hired us.

215
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,198
You'd better surrender,
Iron Monkey, or else.

216
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,990
You impostors!

217
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,993
I'll remove your mask.

218
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,833
You bastards.

219
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,195
You're even worse
than those greedy officers.

220
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,359
The Virgin's Sword Stance.

221
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,079
How can you call yourself a virgin?

222
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,476
You're so ugly,
you look more like a pig!

223
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,479
Lo Han's Double-Edged Sword!

224
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,793
You don't know one side
of the sword from the other!

225
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,269
Take your hands off!

226
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,119
Why don't you leave?
You call yourselves martial artists?

227
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,391
You have to beat me too
before you leave.

228
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,752
Shaolin King Kong Palm.

229
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,068
Your kung fu is good.
You even recognise my Shaolin King Kong Palm.

230
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,308
It's nothing special.

231
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,472
Then try my Nothing Special move.

232
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,876
You can't escape from me.

233
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,275
Iron Monkey?

234
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,639
Shaolin Palm?

235
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,709
The Flying Monk?

236
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,115
Right,
I'm the master of the Flying Monk.

237
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,509
Monk, you rebelled against Shaolin.

238
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,194
It was you who burnt
the Shaolin Temple.

239
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,400
There are no rules. Human beings
die for fortune. Birds die for feed!

240
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,479
Preach to your dead colleagues.

241
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,274
How dare you challenge me.

242
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,828
- Tell me your name.
- Wong Kei-ying.

243
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,469
Wong Kei-ying, your kung fu
is like nothing I've seen before.

244
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,039
You're right.

245
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,915
No Shadow Kick, the Wong family move.

246
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,719
King Kong Palm!

247
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,314
You don't know when to give up.
I might as well finish you off!

248
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,198
Wind and Thunder King Kong Palm!

249
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,839
Lo Han Palm!

250
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,150
Once you've felt my King Kong Palm,
you've no chance of survival.

251
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,039
Are you OK?

252
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,112
Where are you hurt?

253
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,478
Get the needles for me.

254
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,034
I was hit by the King Kong Palm.

255
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,590
Release the poisoned blood first,
then give me the antidote.

256
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,878
Release the blood.

257
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,108
Take down the list of medicines now.

258
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,909
One centipede.

259
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,193
The tail of a scorpion.

260
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,032
The gall of a bear.

261
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,758
One viper.

262
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,158
One lizard...

263
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,756
Big brother, wake up!
Any other medicines?

264
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,592
Wake up.

265
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,079
Dr Yang!

266
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,438
Dad, are you OK?

267
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,035
Fei-hung, dad is hurt,
get Dr Yang now.

268
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,713
Who is he?

269
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,512
Iron Monkey?!

270
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,719
Dad!

271
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,189
- What are you doing, Fei-hung?
- Stop, Dad, he isn't Iron Monkey.

272
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,589
How dare you contradict your father.

273
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,835
Master Wong.

274
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,549
Is Dr Yang Iron Monkey?

275
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,789
Dad!

276
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,193
I just want to inspect
Dr Yang's wound.

277
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,759
Silly boy!

278
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,190
Miss Orchid, please get up.

279
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,556
King Kong Palm?!

280
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,594
Fight poison with poison.
It's a valuable treatment.

281
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,830
What an excellent doctor he is.

282
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,353
- Fei-hung, get a pen and ink ready.
- Yes, Dad.

283
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,434
There are no norms and no rules

284
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,159
You are trapped in a corner

285
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,310
There is nowhere to run

286
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,149
- Gold can't change
- Gold can't change

287
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,708
- Sad for blood
- Sad for blood

288
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,436
Release the blood
and revitalise the soul

289
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,274
A curse that would put you to death

290
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,715
- Emergency aid
- Emergency aid

291
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,758
- One chance for life
- One chance for life

292
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,871
The only way out is death

293
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,955
Hurry up! Cure him.

294
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,629
Dad!

295
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,029
Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying
are both hurt.

296
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,954
Check all the clinics.
Arrest all those who are hurt!

297
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,473
Yes, sir!

298
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,477
Such medicines can cure
all sorts of illnesses.

299
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,676
Po Chi Lam Clinic
is really prestigious.

300
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,149
To cure poison
with poisonous insects.

301
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,076
The impact of your clinic on medicine
in the future will be enormous.

302
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,709
However, will you take me to court?

303
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,751
I can't right now,
but you will be arrested one day.

304
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,955
Take my advice and mend your ways.

305
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,034
My father was a righteous officer
when Wei Zhou was deposed.

306
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,113
His colleagues were greedy
and stole food.

307
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,191
My father was killed because of them.

308
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,829
How can the officers save others
when they can't even save themselves?

309
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,917
You can even buy an officer's post.

310
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,194
If there were fewer greedy officers
in the world,

311
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,670
we wouldn't need Iron Monkey.

312
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,078
- Who is it?
- Master Fox.

313
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,035
- Where is Dr Yang?
- He is out.

314
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,998
- Where is Wong Fei-hung?
- He's with Dr Yang.

315
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,718
Damn it!

316
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,834
The investigator wants them arrested.

317
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,319
Why?

318
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,632
Tell them to leave immediately.

319
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,429
Master Wong...

320
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,873
I heard.

321
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,432
I can't imagine
they're going to arrest me.

322
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,955
Dad, let's leave now.

323
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,990
Fei-hung, you can't follow me,
it's very dangerous.

324
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,392
Go back to Fushan by yourself.

325
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,510
If I don't return...

326
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,752
you take care of yourself.

327
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,478
Yes, Dad.

328
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
Fei-hung,
a man should be as strong as steel.

329
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,155
I understand.

330
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,549
A man should shed blood, not tears.

331
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,435
- Do you understand?
- Don't worry, Dad.

332
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,917
Dr Yang, please look after my dad.

333
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,474
If anything happens,
please let me know.

334
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,039
Of course.

335
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,510
Dad, don't worry about me.

336
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,395
Fei-hung,
have you forgotten my words already?

337
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,708
Don't cry!

338
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,552
Repeat what I said before.

339
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,395
A man should be as strong as steel.
A man should shed blood, not tears.

340
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,679
Master Wong,
I'll show you the back way out.

341
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,230
- We'll find a safe hiding place.
- Fine.

342
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,994
Dad.

343
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,439
Don't worry,
I'll take care of Fei-hung.

344
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,838
Fei-hung, go inside. I'll answer it.

345
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,639
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

346
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,914
Open up!

347
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,271
A girl! A pretty girl.

348
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,875
What do you want? Aren't you monks
ashamed of yourselves?

349
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,033
A monk still needs pretty girls.

350
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,556
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Do you want our lives to be empty?

351
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,358
The Tum Ma move?!

352
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,711
She knows kung fu.
There's something strange about this clinic.

353
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,834
Stranger than you?

354
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,913
I'll show you!

355
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,874
Ether powder.

356
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,199
We got her.

357
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,590
Look at that face.
She's so attractive.

358
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,672
Let's listen to her screams.

359
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,591
We'll do our best to entertain you.
I guarantee a pleasant surprise.

360
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,793
We'll help ourselves.

361
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,908
See how nervous she is.
She must be very anxious.

362
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,030
Relax, this won't take long.

363
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,358
Go to hell you bastard monks!

364
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,997
Monks aren't monks,
officers aren't officers. Bullshit!

365
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,152
You little bastard,
do you want to die?

366
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,673
Auntie, leave now!

367
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,393
Do you want to go in?

368
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,708
Carry the Bow and Shoot the Moon!

369
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,029
Monkey's Rod!

370
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,557
Double Flight from the Sea!

371
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,232
Fisherman's Paddle!

372
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,788
What are you reciting?

373
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,313
Too many stances.

374
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,671
Don't let his stances put you off.

375
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,399
Rod that Sweeps Away all Injustice!

376
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,078
Very powerful.

377
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,876
Strong Force
that Switches North and South!

378
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,635
Don't let him recite. No more!

379
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,835
Over the Top...

380
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,269
Under the Earth!

381
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,713
Stop for a minute.

382
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,033
I don't think so.

383
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,394
Let's see you dance.

384
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,279
Left, right, left, right,
left, right. Halt!

385
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,314
Golden Snake Goes Into the Hole,
Golden Snake Comes Out of the Hole!

386
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,879
Back to the start.

387
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,468
Old witch!
Are you trying to scare the ghosts?

388
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,957
Then you can be a ghost.

389
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,828
No Shadow Kick!

390
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,589
Iron Monkey is Buddha.

391
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,558
The gold which he gave us
can't be spent frivolously.

392
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,200
If we spend it all
there won't be any more.

393
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,033
Dr Yang, Master Wong,
dinner is ready. Let's eat.

394
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,189
Thank you.

395
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,271
There are only two bowls.
What about you?

396
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,078
We have a big abalone.

397
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,751
Don't lie to us.

398
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,513
We'll have the big abalone,
you take the rice.

399
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,876
Well, we'll share
these bowls of rice.

400
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,155
We've already eaten. Here.

401
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,798
I don't even like rice.

402
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,160
- We've eaten. Here.
- I don't like rice.

403
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,912
Miss Ho is here.

404
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,072
Big brother, Fei-hung's been arrested
by the soldiers.

405
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,593
What?

406
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,193
What's wrong with you?

407
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,838
Orchid, Orchid!

408
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,357
It must be the monks. Orchid!

409
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,273
She seems to be suffering
from ether poisoning. Orchid!

410
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,428
Wake her up first.

411
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,350
Wong Fei-hung,
tell us where your father is.

412
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,797
Your dad is here.
Greet him now. Damn baldy!

413
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,756
Tough guy, I'll teach you
a lesson you won't forget.

414
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,673
Wait! If we kill him,
we'll never find Wong Kei-ying.

415
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,432
You're a traitor!

416
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,475
How dare you beat me,
the head of security!

417
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,238
Master Fox!

418
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,999
Master Fox!

419
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,558
Look out!

420
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,317
Hin Hung, let Wong Fei-hung go.

421
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,753
You're not the Iron Monkey I met.

422
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,353
Iron Monkey is Iron Monkey.

423
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,589
Hin Hung, prepare to meet your death!

424
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,393
Iron Monkey is here.

425
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,833
Catch Fei-hung!

426
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,432
The Flying Sleeves!

427
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,029
Come here!

428
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,188
Wong Kei-ying or Iron Monkey,
you still have to die!

429
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,793
Kill them both!

430
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,548
Go to hell!

431
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,954
See the Dart!

432
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,472
- You can't save him now.
- Have pity.

433
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,952
You've come to help.

434
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,918
You must all be in the same gang!

435
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,234
Call yourself a kung fu master?
You're useless!

436
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,549
Don't block my way.

437
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,233
Be gone!

438
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,953
Take Fei-hung away.

439
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,315
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

440
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,075
Take him away.

441
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,392
Flying Sleeves?
What happened to Shaolin Palm?

442
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,556
You didn't die from my palm?
You're tough, huh?

443
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,473
You are an investigator
yet you yourself are underhand.

444
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,915
You are a disgrace
to your profession!

445
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,513
Let's fight, then!

446
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,515
Hurry up!

447
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,268
Stay where you are!

448
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,352
I'll be a laughing stock
if I let you bastards escape!

449
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,437
Old traitor, let's see how many
stances you can resist.

450
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,274
You joined forces with Iron Monkey
and brought shame on our school.

451
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,749
You have no right
to call me a traitor.

452
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,151
Stop pretending to be so righteous.
If it weren't for bastards like you,

453
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,435
there wouldn't be
a need for Iron Monkey!

454
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,958
Flying Sleeves!

455
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,189
Come here!

456
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,033
The Fifth Brother's Rod!

457
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,039
Old traitor!

458
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,155
Come on.

459
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,712
Shaolin King Kong Palm!

460
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,756
- No Shadow Kick!
- Flying Leg!

461
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,354
I'm coming! Damn you, baldy!

462
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,036
Fei-hung, don't!
It's too dangerous.

463
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,513
Up the poles.

464
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,876
Hey! It's burning. Get down.

465
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,519
The fire is burning the poles.

466
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,756
Dad! Iron Monkey! Run!

467
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,355
Hin Hung, I can't defeat you on
the ground, but your balance is bad.

468
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,796
- I'll beat you on the poles.
- Well, come on then.

469
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,999
Let me take your place.

470
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,149
Watch out!

471
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,629
Off the poles.

472
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,119
Not good enough.

473
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,838
Attack the lower part. I'll go first.

474
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,989
No Shadow Kick!

475
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,315
Hit him!

476
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,275
King Kong Falls!

477
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,152
You're no better.

478
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,639
Shaolin King Kong Palm!

479
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,755
Iron Monkey, catch!

480
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,637
Monkey Hangs on the Dried Tree!

481
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,997
Push him down! The monk is losing.

482
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,755
Not so easy!

483
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,871
A Thousand Hand Move!

484
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,633
Kick him off!

485
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,675
Hit him!

486
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,989
Fall down!

487
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,988
It's hooked.

488
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,196
When the wooden poles burn,
we'll have to fight in the fire.

489
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,039
Down, dog!

490
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,029
Stay where you are.
A return for you, monk!

491
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,031
I'll sweep away all the poles.

492
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,359
Iron Monkey, over here!

493
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,678
There's only one pole left,
you're going to fall!

494
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,274
It's going!

495
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,835
Stand at the two ends.

496
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,873
You can't stand properly.

497
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,515
Don't worry about us.

498
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,794
The pole under your feet
won't last much longer.

499
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,711
You'll be buried in this sea of fire.

500
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,390
Kick the pole and push me across.

501
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,828
- The door is open.
- One pole to the sky.

502
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,789
Monk, we tricked you.
One pole to the sea!

503
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,516
You are totally wicked.
Down to the fire!

504
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,912
- Hurry up! Throw the rod here.
- OK!

505
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,439
Catch!

506
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,549
Dad.

507
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,593
I'm fine.

508
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,877
I thought
I was never going to see you again.

509
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,315
Why doesn't anybody care about me?

510
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,914
Don't just stand there, leave now.

511
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,115
Go!

512
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,756
"Train Station"

513
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,039
Master Wong, who knows
when we'll meet again?

514
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,475
Dr Yang, Miss Ho, why don't you come
to Fushan to visit us?

515
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,788
Auntie, you must come.

516
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,518
Master Wong, I'm sorry I'm late.

517
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,239
Ah, you've come to see us off
though you're so busy.

518
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,630
Don't mention it.
I'm busy catching Iron Monkey.

519
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,438
Another new officer is coming.

520
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,317
I hope he is a good one.

521
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,031
Well, we must say goodbye.
Fei-hung, let's go.

522
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,355
Take care.
