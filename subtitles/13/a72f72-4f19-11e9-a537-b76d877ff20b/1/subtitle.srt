"Tea house"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,791
"Iron Monkey"

3
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,639
It's so cold,
how can the refugees stand it?

4
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,188
There's been lots of natural
disasters recently.

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,111
And even more corrupt officials.

6
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,159
Another arrives today.
He's well known for his evil ways.

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,993
Do you think Iron Monkey will appear?

8
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,314
"The Government House of Chekiang"

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,749
Follow me... this way.

10
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,675
Please have some dim sum first.
Masters, the midnight snack is ready.

11
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,548
Enough! Not while we're listening
for any movement on the roof.

12
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,473
Masters, help yourselves.

13
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,671
"Honesty and Justice for all"

14
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,715
If the food isn't on time,
forget it.

15
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,951
Clumsy fool. Leave us!
We're trying to catch Iron Monkey.

16
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,753
I heard the monks were brought
from the Shaolin Temple.

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,989
Who knows?

18
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,877
Let's have a midnight snack.

19
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,790
Stop squashing me, you girls.

20
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,356
Don't keep climbing
in and out of bed.

21
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,318
Do you want Iron Monkey
to know my treasure is down there?

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,595
- Come out!
- I just want my share.

23
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,831
Do you really want
to divide it up now?

24
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,319
Quick, hide!

25
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,389
Sir.

26
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,550
It's the head of security, Fox.

27
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,313
I've got abalone and ginseng soup
for you and your wives.

28
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,391
Do you think now is the time?

29
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,074
Don't touch it
or I'll deduct half a year's salary!

30
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,149
I wouldn't dare.

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,195
On the roof!

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,392
There's something happening up there!
Shoot!

33
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,271
Not even a bird can get in.

34
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,511
If Iron Monkey comes,
we'll turn him into a hedgehog!

35
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,069
It is Iron Monkey!

36
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,269
Master.

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,951
Stand to, men! Stand to!

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,633
Stay calm.

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,555
There are too many of you.
Get out of the way!

40
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,838
Master, it's us.

41
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,639
Get out of the way, you men!

42
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,348
Catch him!

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,793
You men stay put.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,273
He wants to lead us into a trap.
Stay at your posts.

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,588
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,077
You can't escape this time,
Iron Monkey.

47
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,195
You aren't monks!

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,234
- You dare mock us Shaolin?
- To hell with Shaolin.

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,231
You call yourselves Shaolin monks?

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,758
I'll teach you impostors a lesson!

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,512
Good always triumphs over evil!

52
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,797
You call yourself good?
Aiding corruption is never good.

53
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,597
You know it's wrong, so don't do it!

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,758
He got in!

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,998
Honey, help me escape
and I'll give you your share.

56
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,958
- It's too late now!
- Go to hell!

57
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,317
Officer Cheng, set the trap off!

58
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,750
I am too cunning, you can't beat me!

59
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,872
See you later!

60
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,829
Lower the net!
You're a lucky man, sir.

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,276
You said the net was impenetrable!
Go and take a look!

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,436
- Go and check the roof.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,828
Shaolin!

64
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,110
- Be careful.
- It's very high.

65
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,159
Damned Iron Monkey.
I'm not going to buy a coffin

66
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,312
before I spend all this money.
I'll thank my lucky stars.

67
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,189
Your Excellency,

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,431
I've posted guards everywhere,
I don't think he'll get in again.

69
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,355
What is this?

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,274
Shark fin? I told you not to eat it!

71
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,918
- No, sir.
- Deduct your salary.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,399
I broke the bowl accidentally...

73
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,710
Your Excellency,
there's no sign of him.

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,792
Everyone will be deducted a month's
salary to go to a reward.

75
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,030
If you can't catch him,
the money is mine!

76
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,155
Damn you all, fools!

77
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,992
What company are you from?

78
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,672
Fox, you're smart, don't blink.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,433
Your Excellency, Iron Monkey!

80
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,988
Thank you for your donation
to the flood appeal.

81
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,556
Thank you for your jewels,
your donation to the disaster.

82
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,074
Because of your kind donation,
I won't kill you.

83
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,516
You've already taken my life!

84
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,312
Iron Monkey is wanted again.

85
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,311
Let's see if this officer
can get him.

86
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,710
Mr Fox, those who haven't been caught
by the government must thank God.

87
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,472
If he's caught, then we'll thank God.

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,838
This is a little gift
sent to you by my master.

89
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,718
He intends to make
the Islamic Temple into a brothel.

90
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,997
When the application is submitted,

91
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,719
perhaps His Excellency
would look on it favourably.

92
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,997
Say, we can make money together.
How could we make a deal without you?

93
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,273
His Excellency is in a bad mood.
I have to bargain with him directly.

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,557
Take the gifts back or I won't be
able to repay it if any is lost.

95
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,595
Iron...

96
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,314
Don't mention the name,
it's bad luck.

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,676
One month of our salary has been deducted.

98
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,830
We have to pay our own medical bills.

99
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,195
Thank you for the money,
which solves our problem.

100
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,633
Come and thank Mr Chan.

101
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,073
Thank you.

102
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,678
"Pa Cho Hall"

103
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,552
- Old man, is your throat sore?
- Yes.

104
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,474
- Do you also have diarrhoea?
- Yes.

105
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,755
All right, give me your hand.

106
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,070
What's wrong with me, Doctor?

107
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,596
You are sexually overactive.
Your kidney is weak.

108
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,390
You are always eating shark's fin
and ginseng. Such food makes you hot.

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,675
You are too weak
to afford such nutritious foods.

110
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,035
How can nutritious foods
cause illness?

111
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,315
How is this possible?
What should I do, Doctor?

112
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,153
I'm telling you the truth.
It's making you weak.

113
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,275
One hundred dollars.

114
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,839
One hundred dollars!

115
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,673
I don't have that much, Doctor.

116
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,515
Don't worry, old man.
You can go, I won't take a penny from you.

117
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,353
Thank you.

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,955
Why is he free
and yet you charge me so much?

119
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,438
You're a rich man,
so your medicine is expensive.

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,956
If you can't afford it,
I'll prescribe cheaper medicines for you.

121
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,473
I not afford it? Pay him.

122
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,792
You really do cure him.

123
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,229
Thank you.

124
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,548
You're looking better.

125
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,790
- Doctor Yang.
- Master Fox.

126
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,314
Good business.
So many patients in your clinic.

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,994
You are such a versatile doctor.

128
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,073
Most of them come from Hoi Ning.
They have the plague as well as flooding.

129
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,799
They've been walking for three days.

130
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,632
What? The plague?

131
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,878
It's horrible!

132
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,554
Oh, here's Miss Orchid.

133
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,191
Obstipantia, disinfectants,
check the herb list, don't make any mistakes.

134
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,316
It's as busy as a restaurant in here.

135
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,435
Miss Orchid.

136
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,431
Master Fox. What's wrong with you?

137
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,354
Nothing. You're getting rich
from such a prosperous business.

138
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,953
I heard Iron Monkey was arrested,
is that true?

139
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,713
I got him in my Pallium Stance.
He couldn't move.

140
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,031
I gave him another severe blow
before he could do anything.

141
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,034
That's what happened to him?

142
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,838
Yeah, that's what happened.

143
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,115
That's great
that you caught Iron Monkey.

144
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,910
So many of my colleagues
had been hurt,

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,992
I gave him a chance to mend his ways
and I let him go.

146
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,789
Master Fox, every time you set a trap
to catch Iron Monkey,

147
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,429
you always let him go free.
You're giving him too many chances.

148
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,311
I guess I owe him.

149
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,392
He appeared two years ago
when I was transferred to this town.

150
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,313
One day I'll tear his mask off!

151
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,308
Master Fox,
if you feel the heat, let go.

152
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,789
So hot...!

153
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,509
What's wrong with a light touch?
Were you the hooker from the brothel?

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,034
We're a little short of girls.
Come and join us.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,235
Get lost!

156
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,309
How dare you!

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,590
How dare you be so rude here!
Find your hookers elsewhere.

158
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,151
Are you Master Fox?
We are friends, please forgive...

159
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,360
This clinic is under my protection.
No vulgar behaviour is allowed here!

160
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,351
Master Fox, show me some respect.

161
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,034
If you do,
I'll give you 100 pieces of gold.

162
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,798
How dare you bribe me so openly!
Take him to the cells!

163
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,836
How dare you! I'll sue you...

164
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,196
You won't even get to see
the governor without my say so.

165
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,508
Go!

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,355
"Chinese Herbs Cure Disease"

167
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,919
Thank you, Master Fox.

168
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,716
Master Fox, take this medicine
for your fellow soldiers.

169
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,873
Apply it to their wounds twice daily
and they'll be cured in 3-4 days.

170
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,190
- Thank you.
- Take care.

171
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,112
The new officer is coming,

172
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,112
I'm sure Iron Monkey will come
and make trouble.

173
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,792
I hope he doesn't appear again.

174
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,632
Master Fox, be careful.

175
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,157
- Good morning, Dr Yang.
- Good morning.

176
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,355
Mr Fox... Are you thinking
he may be Iron Monkey?

177
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,070
Everyone seems to be Iron Monkey in my eyes.

178
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,998
"Pa Cho Hall"

179
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,078
Cook it for longer, then the abalone
will taste much better.

180
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,676
You're lying, that's not abalone,
it's just some tree bark.

181
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,318
A monkey screeching?

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,037
It's real gold!
Iron Monkey has come to save us.

183
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,236
Give it to me. I'm in charge.

184
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,114
Who threw that?

185
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,872
It's Iron Monkey.

186
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,598
He's too greedy.

187
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,912
I'm not greedy. Let's share it
amongst us. Thank you, Iron Monkey.

188
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,033
It's so cold...
The building's falling down!

189
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,918
No, it's gold,
it must be Iron Monkey.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,638
Thank you, Iron Monkey.

191
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,954
What's up? Work harder!

192
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,909
All these refugees are so cheap.
I'll get some strong men tomorrow instead!

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,150
Work harder or do you want a beating?

194
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,595
We haven't eaten all day.

195
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,433
Right, my dog's hungry too!

196
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,634
Don't expect any pity.
I'll employ someone else tomorrow!

197
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,754
A dead rat!

198
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,431
Who's there? Who threw that?

199
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,078
Bullying kids, revolting!

200
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,193
Iron Monkey really exists!
Iron Monkey the Merciful.

201
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,111
Iron Monkey?

202
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,797
Let me help you.

203
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,440
You still come out
in this axful weather.

204
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,040
The new officer, Cheng Pak Fong
arrests people for no reason.

205
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,712
He is beating the people up.

206
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,433
I will visit him tomorrow
and teach him a lesson.

207
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,834
Vegetables and tofu for every meal.

208
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,036
It's so boring, Master!

209
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,998
Are you really so poor you have to
take up an official post?

210
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,470
If we can't find the money,
we wouldn't even have this to eat.

211
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,156
I may as well go back to the brothel.

212
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,109
It's hard work supporting
all of my nine mistresses.

213
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,990
OK, I'll open the storeroom
and sell it all. Then we can leave.

214
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,594
Make sure you get a good price,
then we'll leave.

215
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,238
All you think about is food.

216
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,605
Boy, come here.

217
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,045
Sir, I don't have any money left.

218
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,548
Your salary is worthless.
Follow me to the storeroom.

219
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,915
Sir, it is a letter from the capital.

220
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,995
Sir, is it a good position?

221
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,154
The State Governor is coming
to investigate me.

222
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,390
If Iron Monkey appears,
then we're in trouble.

223
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,153
Why are you still standing there?

224
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,676
Arrest Iron Monkey. Arrest anyone
who's remotely connected to him!

225
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,715
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,351
"Huang the Invincible's
Last Apprentice"

227
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,238
- What move are you practising?
- The Monkey's Palm.

228
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,435
- Really?
- Yes.

229
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,511
- Right, let's go.
- Why?

230
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,477
You said the word 'monkey'.

231
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,074
The word monkey brings trouble.
Take the sign down.

232
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,833
Arrest those whose name is Monkey.
Still want to run away?

233
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,231
You look like a monkey,
take him away.

234
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,073
Sir, since when is a sneeze
an offence?

235
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,469
You act like a monkey. Take him away!

236
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,391
Monkey and date powder!

237
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,595
What are you selling?

238
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,113
Don't mention the word monkey.

239
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,155
Look for yourself.

240
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,437
You won't even say what you're selling?
You must be scared.

241
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,475
Take him away!

242
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,351
- Hold on tight.
- Yes, Dad.

243
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,475
Dad.

244
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,712
Fei-hung, you're old enough
to walk on your own now!

245
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,994
Recite the herb list.

246
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,992
Chiretta, good for blood.
Ginseng, good for respiration.

247
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,312
Crocodile, to cure catarrh.
Lizard to treat poisoning. Tin-tsi...

248
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,351
Tin-tsi...

249
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,236
To cure swelling, you fool.

250
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,959
Tin-tsi to cure swelling, you fool.

251
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,955
- Boss.
- Master, Wong.

252
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,474
The herbs are all ready.

253
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,075
I'm going back to Fushan tomorrow.
Please send them to my lodgings.

254
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,559
No problem.

255
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,677
That's all you've made
from a whole day's work?

256
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,196
Do you think this is a charity house?
If you have nothing, you must steal.

257
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,918
Watch yourselves.

258
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,635
Who did that?

259
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,269
Fei-hung, honest people
don't do such sneaky things.

260
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,395
Shoot at me?

261
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,950
Go back to the inn
and practise foot work for two hours.

262
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,309
Go pick his pocket.

263
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,275
What are you doing picking pockets
at your age?

264
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,316
I'll never do it again, sir.

265
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,358
I'll let you go this time,
but you'd better not do it again.

266
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,115
You are lucky.
I have to practise for two hours.

267
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,951
What's wrong with practising?

268
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,758
What's so bad about stealing?

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,479
Is it good to teach you a lesson?

270
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,759
- He could be Iron Monkey.
- I think you're right.

271
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,114
Dad.

272
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,472
Stop! You're disturbing the peace.
Come with us.

273
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,788
He stole my stuff.

274
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,475
I didn't see that,
but I did see you fight. This way.

275
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,317
Why are they only arresting them?

276
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,993
"Honesty and Justice for all"

277
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,479
Don't act so pitifully!

278
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,757
Behind your ignorant faces,

279
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,196
any one of you may be
the terrible Iron Monkey.

280
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,350
Speak up! Show yourself!

281
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,678
Be sensible.
I'll release anyone who speaks up.

282
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,390
I'll release those who give me
any information about Iron Monkey.

283
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,479
Speak out!

284
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,637
Sir, there's a monkey
flashing his backside at you.

285
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,118
How dare you disgrace this court
like this!

286
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,590
I hate indecency! Take him away
and punish him severely!

287
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,320
Sir, you will be eating
monkey's brain tonight.

288
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,231
Don't tell my mistresses.

289
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,556
If no one confesses,
you will all be fined 50 dollars.

290
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,392
50 dollars? Is that all?

291
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,708
What do you expect?

292
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,918
Under the circumstances,
each of you are fined 500 dollars!

293
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,273
If you can't pay,
it's the brand for you!

294
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,072
Where are you now, Iron Monkey?

295
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,232
If you were a real hero,
you would come out.

296
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,154
You look pissed off.

297
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,555
Execute!

298
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,999
Dad! You can't do this
without any proof, Your Excellency.

299
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,071
How dare you!

300
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,515
He presumes to tell you
how to govern, sir.

301
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,357
How dare you be so rude to me at such
a young age. Give him 30 lashes!

302
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,878
He is just a child, sir.

303
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,838
If you plead for him,
you will be suspect.

304
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,514
Your Excellency, he is too young.
He can't take it.

305
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,639
If he wants to escape the punishment,
he has to pay, otherwise punish him!

306
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,029
Don't move!

307
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,839
Your Excellency, you are punishing
the innocent, Iron Monkey's here.

308
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,957
If it wasn't for my cunning,
you'd never have come out during the day.

309
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,270
You're trapped! Positions, gun troop!

310
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,154
Kill him!

311
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,953
He's gone outside! Go after him!

312
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,270
If this is how you behave,
you'd best resign!

313
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,149
Your eyebrows! They're gone!

314
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,710
What? They brought me good luck.
Now I'm going to be unlucky.

315
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,519
Iron Monkey,
I arrest you to save the innocent.

316
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,915
Who are you?

317
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,991
- You're good.
- So are you.

318
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,079
My foot.

319
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,035
It's so exciting.
They're such good kung fu masters.

320
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,951
- Put the ladders up.
- Yes, sir!

321
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,875
It's a kid.

322
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,311
- Fei-hung, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

323
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,479
You're a great fighter, hero.

324
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,358
- My father's well known in...
- Boy. He has such a big mouth.

325
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,635
He is as powerful as Iron Monkey.

326
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,914
Sir, Iron Monkey was here,
so we're proved innocent.

327
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,194
May we leave now?

328
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,317
No! You could well be his partner.

329
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,234
No one will be released
until he is caught.

330
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,435
Very wise, sir.

331
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,229
Let us go. Show mercy, please, sir.

332
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,473
Sir, if I, Wong Kei-ying,

333
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,950
take responsibility for catching
Iron Monkey, will you let them go?

334
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,759
- Wong Kei-ying from Canton?
- Yes, sir.

335
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,989
Nice to meet you.

336
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,310
Wong Kei-ying is very famous.

337
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,914
More famous than me?

338
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,356
Wong Kei-ying,
I'll show mercy this time.

339
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,989
Arrest Iron Monkey
before seven days are up.

340
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,117
I will keep your son here
in the meantime.

341
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,077
You're detaining my son?

342
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,912
Your belongings too!

343
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,675
With your son in jail,
you won't escape.

344
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,795
Court adjourned!

345
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,835
- Are you going alone?
- I'll arrest Iron Monkey soon.

346
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,916
Don't worry, I'll look after him.

347
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,035
Thank you.

348
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,513
Set them free.

349
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,276
He's helping arrest Iron Monkey?

350
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,759
What a bastard!

351
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,917
Come this way.
The noodles are delicious.

352
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,279
Another bowl of noodles.
I'm sure you'll enjoy such delicious noodles.

353
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,195
Noodles, please.

354
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,319
Are you Wong Kei-ying
who fought Iron Monkey?

355
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,355
I am.

356
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,591
Shame on you.
I won't sell you anything. Go!

357
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,994
- Why?
- Ask the fortune teller.

358
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,468
Why?

359
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,313
Can I have two buns, please?

360
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,595
I won't sell you anything, bastard.

361
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,113
Who are you calling a bastard?

362
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,393
I'll pay.

363
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,995
I won't sell it to you.
If you want it, you'll have to steal it.

364
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,035
I'll take my money.

365
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,669
Thief! Wong Kei-ying is a thief!
He's robbing my money! Thief!

366
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,472
Bastard!

367
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,396
Do you want a bun? Five cents each.

368
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,595
So expensive?

369
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,638
It's not expensive.
I'm risking my life to sell to you.

370
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,274
I quit! I'm sorry.

371
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,197
Hot buns.

372
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,157
I'll take 20 buns.

373
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,229
Thanks.

374
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,357
They can't tell right from wrong.

375
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,596
Honest people don't do sneaky things.

376
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,952
Except this time.

377
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,316
Luckily Fei-hung isn't around.

378
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,994
That fell on the ground,
are you sure you want to eat it, my friend?

379
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,396
I'm so hungry, I haven't eaten in two days.
I don't care if it's dirty.

380
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,711
I don't know why,
but they refuse to sell me food here.

381
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,030
You seem to be a stranger here.

382
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,908
Don't eat that.

383
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,514
- Come and have some soup.
- Soup?

384
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,953
Sorry about my stomach.
I'm so hungry. If it had been rice...

385
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,115
You are so slow.

386
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,395
You are too slow at frying.
When can I eat?

387
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,550
I'm sorry, Master Wong,
I'm a bit slow.

388
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,552
- Not at all.
- Be patient, it will be ready soon.

389
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,154
Master Wong,

390
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,475
we grow a special kind of chilli,
which we call sweating, it's so hot.

391
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,675
Even a little makes your nose run.
You must try some later.

392
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,675
Water.

393
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,039
Are you thirsty?

394
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,078
Don't drink water, there's the soup.

395
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,996
I wasn't thirsty, I was just cleaning
my mouth so the soup tastes better.

396
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,072
Remember to wear an apron the next
time you want to clean your mouth.

397
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,390
Let me help you, Miss Ho.

398
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,074
I can prepare some dishes
from home for you.

399
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,519
Golden chicken, it smells delicious!
Master Wong, you are a great cook.

400
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,714
My wife passed away a while ago,
so I do all the housework myself.

401
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,918
Master Wong, we are honoured
to have you cooking for us.

402
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,560
It's only Cantonese food,
please try some.

403
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,837
Well, let us Northerners
and Southerners sit down together.

404
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,071
Let me make some Northern
speciality noodles for you.

405
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,592
The first slice, God's blessing.

406
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,715
The second slice,
no more natural disasters.

407
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,394
The third, peace and prosperity.

408
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,391
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

409
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,278
The wine brings friends together.

410
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,396
To all the friends we've known.

411
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,515
Cheers.

412
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,079
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

413
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,310
Master Wong, what is worrying you?

414
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,630
I am thinking of my son.

415
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,631
I have all this great food here.

416
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,599
But my son is behind bars and I don't
know if he's eaten at all.

417
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,194
I don't know if anyone
is looking after him.

418
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,000
Dr Yang,
have you heard of Iron Monkey?

419
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,518
Yes, I've heard the talk.
Do you want to find him?

420
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,477
If I catch him,
I'll chop his head off!

421
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,073
Is he your enemy?

422
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,436
The governor is keeping my son
in jail until I arrest Iron Monkey.

423
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,354
If I can't catch him,
my son and I can never go back to Fushan.

424
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,112
Both the good and bad are against us.

425
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,636
- What's your son's name?
- Wong Fei-hung.

426
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,039
Wong Fei-hung.

427
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,678
I won't bother you any further.

428
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,070
The quicker I catch Iron Monkey,
the quicker I see my son.

429
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,155
Dr Yang, Miss Ho,
I'll repay you one day.

430
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,151
See you soon.

431
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,633
Master Wong,
knock on the door when you are tired.

432
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,995
We stay up quite late.

433
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,473
- Thank you.
- Take care.

434
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,475
- Orchid...
- I know, you're going for the boy.

435
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,677
The officers won't look after him.

436
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,676
Take the medicine box. It will help.

437
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,554
I'm thirsty, some water, please.

438
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,471
Shut up!

439
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,870
Why does this child sleep
the whole day long?

440
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,157
Is he OK?
Does he need to see a doctor?

441
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,708
Whoever loses has to drink.

442
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,949
Master Fox...

443
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,029
Open the gate.

444
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,032
Wong Fei-hung, you have a visitor.

445
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,759
His forehead is hot and his mouth
is dry, Dr Yang. I think he is sick.

446
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,398
He can't stay here any more.

447
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,153
It's lucky we discovered it now.
Many people have caught the plague.

448
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,434
The plague?

449
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,397
It's not that bad, don't panic.

450
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,472
We're not panicking,
we're just afraid.

451
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,189
The investigator will arrive
in the next two days.

452
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,233
I can't take care of him.

453
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,599
Master Fox, conditions here are appalling.
Let him stay in my house.

454
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,199
Sorry to trouble you.

455
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,748
Don't start anything
or I'll punish you!

456
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,595
We won't cause any trouble.
We're happy you're moving him.

457
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,793
Dad's umbrella.

458
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,078
Master Wong!

459
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,832
- Come over for a midnight snack.
- OK.

460
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,635
Having a hotpot on the roof
makes it taste even nicer.

461
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,551
I've never done it before.

462
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,032
- Help yourself.
- All right.

463
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,271
Master Fox,
thank you for looking after my son.

464
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,909
Master Wong,
if you can't catch Iron Monkey on time,

465
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,436
I'll work something out
so you and your son can leave.

466
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,636
Don't worry.

467
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,278
But you might get in trouble.

468
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,079
I may be a bad official,
but I can protect myself.

469
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,912
A hero should be respected.

470
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,675
Hero?

471
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,634
People hold thieves up as heroes.

472
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,311
In fact,
we are all just water in the pot,

473
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,436
heated by the burning fire.

474
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,159
If the fire keeps burning,
the water will dry up.

475
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,193
Who can put out the fire?

476
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,314
When will we get good officials?

477
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,838
Damn it! Who's blocking the chimney?

478
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,789
Iron Monkey?

479
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,678
Hey! Wait for me!

480
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,074
Which one of you is Iron Monkey?

481
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,638
I am Master Fox,
you are under arrest.

482
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,831
Kidnap a woman? A rapist?

483
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,553
- The Shaolin Palm?
- You practise Shaolin kung fu.

484
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,030
- So what?
- Are you Shaolin apprentices?

485
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,109
A monk?

486
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,073
No Shadow Kick!

487
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,548
- The Super Eagle's Claw!
- Your master is the monk, Hin Hung.

488
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,200
You are a Shaolin rebel.

489
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,155
Dad, look out.

490
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,391
Here comes Iron Monkey.
Be careful.

491
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,469
Fei-hung.

492
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,995
It's you.

493
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,878
Tell Dad I'm OK.

494
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,000
The old one
worries about the young one.

495
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,869
The young one
worries about the old one.

496
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,834
Such a caring father and son.

497
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,114
I know who you are.

498
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,398
What did he say?

499
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,994
Ask him when he wakes up.

500
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,873
Difficult to distinguish you

501
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,589
A face of weariness

502
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,714
It's difficult to predict my fate

503
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,673
Orchid, Peony,
come and greet the guests.

504
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,238
My son.

505
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,033
My son.

506
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,359
It's time to see clients again.
It's been nine months. Get ready.

507
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,154
How dare you stab me!

508
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,559
Bitch!

509
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,032
I want to redeem Miss Ho.

510
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,951
Take the three gold pieces.

511
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,229
Willows and flowers follow the wind

512
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,279
A doctor cares
for patients from all parts

513
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,113
Maybe for the fulfilment
of our commitment

514
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,999
Count the fortune of your life

515
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,994
You go that way and you go that way.

516
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,117
How can you mess up
in the Governor's house?

517
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,555
Shit! Where is the Governor?

518
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,959
Hold it...

519
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,996
You want to see His Excellency.
Do you have an appointment?

520
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,188
Idiot!
Does the investigator need one?

521
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,511
Use the royal fan
to hit these bastards.

522
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,750
The royal fan?

523
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,308
Looks like this place
hasn't changed much.

524
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,756
I didn't see you on my last patrol.

525
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,672
- Are you new?
- I've been here two years now.

526
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,151
Did you check his identification?

527
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,117
I didn't dare, I'm only a junior.

528
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,952
Stop moving. I'm getting all wet!

529
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,031
Give me a kiss.

530
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,955
Turn your head.

531
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,876
How can I fix it
while you move about so much?

532
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,713
Do a good job for me.

533
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,749
Who are you?

534
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,149
You knew I was coming.

535
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,230
Look at the time.
How can you play in such a way?

536
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,634
Your Excellency.

537
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,189
Get the documents.
Come and see me once you are dressed.

538
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,269
Yes, sir.

539
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,791
I'm a busy man. Don't waste my time.

540
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,239
The royal fan?

541
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,634
Isn't that the royal fan?

542
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,837
I had the pleasure
of being hit with it.

543
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,957
Have you seen his royal seal?

544
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,031
I'm only a junior, I dared not ask.

545
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,795
Idiot. Help me get dressed.

546
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,076
How can you be Governor?
These documents are a mess!

547
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,753
Please forgive me, sir.

548
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,273
- Pick them up.
- Yes, sir.

549
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,950
May I see the royal seal?

550
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,591
You can't have done this job long.
Don't you know who I am?

551
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,515
Bring me my briefcase.

552
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,430
Where are my papers?

553
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,749
What's this?

554
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,878
Iron Monkey?!

555
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,633
Iron Monkey? What is it?

556
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,517
He is a notorious criminal.

557
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,239
He commits all sorts
of horrible crimes.

558
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,478
This is ridiculous!

559
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,835
I didn't blame you
for not keeping the peace,

560
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,070
but how can you allow thieves
in this house?

561
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,151
How can you be Governor?

562
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,434
Please forgive me.

563
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,318
How can my official seal
turn into a monkey?
