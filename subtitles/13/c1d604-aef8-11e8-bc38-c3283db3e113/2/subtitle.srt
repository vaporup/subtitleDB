1
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,682
At exactly 5:30, you will enter
the Net World cybercafe

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,694
As usual, most computers will
be occupied at that hour...

3
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:21,363
and the seat at the entrance
will be vacant

4
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,025
That's the seat you must take

5
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:27,699
You will at once go to the
website of Universal Bank

6
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:30,240
Without losing time,
you will get to work

7
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:36,747
By that time you will be in
the eyes of a few special people.

8
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:42,753
From my computer, I will keep
track as to where you're going

9
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:57,768
To go to the Current Account page
from the bank's home-page...

10
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:01,937
you'll have to type in the password.
The password is magic:3259

11
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:08,144
That's it. What happens next,
you very well know, Jai

12
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:10,807
All the best.

13
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:16,821
I love you, Neha.

14
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:29,158
ACP Suresh Chauhan. Let's go

15
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:49,546
Anna...?
- Yes, Jayant?

16
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,886
Switch on the news, Anna. The
internet guy's been caught

17
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:55,989
The godamn... - The cops caught
him only this evening

18
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,825
No one would imagine he's a crook.
Such a young pisser

19
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:03,828
Switch it on...
- I am, I am

20
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:08,832
This arrest proves that it's no
difficult task for the Mumbai police...

21
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,876
to track down a hi-tech criminal

22
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:16,881
This youth who staked a claim to
a huge booty of 5.5 billion...

23
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,213
will be presented
in court tomorrow..

24
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:21,878
..surprisingly such crimes
are on the rise

25
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:22,886
Get lost!

26
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:38,903
Get out of my way!
- Anna!

27
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:42,930
Cricket! They've made a stadium
out of my compound!

28
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:48,941
Give that to me. I'll
play cricket now

29
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:54,953
These guys will now give up our
profession and turn cricketers!

30
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:59,219
Whom did I ask to handle the case
of the computer hacking thief?

31
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,883
Me, Anna

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,894
You, you...!

33
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:06,897
all play, no work!

34
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,894
Die!

35
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:17,242
Cricket he plays!

36
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:25,943
The cops found him before you. And
you've been playing cricket!

37
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:32,952
Now listen! That cur won't be
presented in court tomorrow

38
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:35,289
He's coming here! You get that?

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,294
Yes, Anna. I do

40
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,957
Go ahead and bowl. Go on

41
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,967
Toss it up again

42
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,950
C'mon! Move it!

43
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,953
Move it!

44
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:12,957
He has arrived.

45
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,293
Move.

46
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,958
Go back side.

47
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:22,006
Move a side.

48
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:59,009
Come on, come with me.

49
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,680
Come.. drag him along.

50
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:14,021
Push this wretch inside.

51
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,037
Let me go!

52
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:48,086
Where do you think you're
going? Come on! - Let go of me.

53
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,695
Don't shoot! Don't!

54
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:44,148
C'mon, everyone get in. We
need to go back to the station.

55
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,105
Neha.. Neha.. I .. that..!

56
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:10,140
What are you doing here, Jai?

57
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:16,146
The cops. They're after me!
Anna's guys tried to kill me!

58
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:03,425
Well? Why are you surprised?

59
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:08,332
Didn't you take me by surprise too?
By forcing yourself on me?

60
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,162
Believe me, Neha.

61
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:14,963
I've never done such a thing,
Neha. I can even die for you!

62
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,903
I love you, Neha. I really love you.

63
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:23,180
I was so surprised when
I got to know..

64
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:25,875
..that you had swallowed
sleeping pills for Neha!

65
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,236
You weren't put to sleep...

66
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:54,605
but our luck surely woke up

67
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:00,215
Here you are. It'll open up
your brains and your heart

68
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,209
No?

69
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:05,211
Cheers!

70
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,226
We were hopelessly trapped

71
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:20,429
And suddenly, I met you outside the
Gurudwara after my fast was complete.

72
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,570
You wanted to die for Neha anyway

73
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,442
So we thought we'd turn
your death into..

74
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,275
..an opportunity of
life for ourselves

75
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:33,077
Don't take it badly, okay?

76
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,284
I hope you'll understand
that I've done..

77
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:37,287
..all this only for
the sake of my love

78
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:43,291
After all, you're a lover too

79
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:49,794
And God always helps lovers.
So He saved you for our sake

80
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:55,405
You have no idea what you have
done for a couple in love, Jai

81
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:01,605
Police!

82
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:05,277
Open the door!

83
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:10,619
Would I put to you trouble, if it was
so easy to escape from the police?

84
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:19,886
No. To be honest, you haven't been
wise in running away from the police

85
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,632
Jai, I am sorry.

86
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:27,296
You've done so much for us

87
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,801
So that door remains shut, as
long as we finish our drinks

88
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,510
So go on. Save your life

89
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,346
Police!

90
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,520
Open the door! Open it!

91
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:06,410
Yes, officer? - We're looking for a
man called Jai. Has someone come here?

92
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:10,405
I haven't seen anyone, no

93
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,482
Sorry to disturb you.

94
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,417
Poor boy

95
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,486
Gone blind? - Stop there...

96
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,986
What's going on? - I haven't
done anything. Listen to me...

97
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:57,020
Why are you pulling out the gun?
I haven't done anything, I say!

98
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,427
Let go of the gun! Let go, I say!

99
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:10,602
Get him! He shot me
and is trying to escape.

100
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,442
Catch hold of him.

101
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,540
I love you, Jai.

102
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:24,346
I can't believe someone
can love me so much

103
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,550
I owe them 60 million

104
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:35,357
Promise me, that you
will not rob the bank

105
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:41,064
Why talk about dying? Our
lives have just begun

106
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,559
Sorry, Jai.

107
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:44,351
'The one I loved, I have found'

108
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:51,693
'I've found peace, but
I've lost my heart'

109
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:59,231
'Your charms...'

110
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:06,666
'have bowled me over, my love'

111
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:14,011
'I have found the one I loved'

112
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:21,184
'I have found my peace,
but I've lost my heart'

113
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,856
'Your charms...'

114
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:36,062
'have bowled me over, my love'

115
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:39,093
'The kohl in your eyes drives me
crazy. Your beauty drives me mad'

116
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:48,143
'It's your gaze that guides
me through the ways of love'

117
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:57,753
'Let me sway, let me kiss
you, here's our chance'

118
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:06,561
'I'm sure you don't know...'

119
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:13,768
'this is the kick you
get out of my love'

120
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:09,987
'Hold me to your lips, my love.
Quench the thirst of your heart'

121
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:19,334
'In roses, we live. There's
not a thorn in sight'

122
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:24,836
'My desire for you
awakens an ache..'

123
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:28,002
'you're the one who
lights up my breath'

124
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:37,054
'The hues of love...'

125
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:44,387
'shakes up the world'

126
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:05,882
Two months later.

127
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:45,947
You got the 60 million?

128
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:54,120
Hello! - Congratulations
on a new life, Neha

129
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:58,961
Vikram...
- What happened?

130
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,967
It's Jai!

131
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:05,969
There's no one, Neha

132
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,314
Believe me Vikram,
it was a call from Jai!

133
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:16,349
Jai's dead. Dead. It's two
months since he died

134
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:22,351
Hey... relax, honey. Go to sleep

135
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,038
Vikram, could you give
me the towel please?

136
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:21,407
Thanks.

137
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:41,896
Keep with it you forever. Remember,
I'm always with you

138
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,148
Vikram, open the door

139
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:57,680
Happy anniversary, my love.

140
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:00,148
You almost killed me!
- Why?

141
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,148
C'mon, let's go, celebrate!

142
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,155
It's exactly four
years since we met

143
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:15,329
I didn't even realise how time flew
by, while I've been in love with you

144
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:21,367
The dress I kept upstairs,
did you change it?

145
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,498
Me...? No, I didn't

146
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:29,338
The ring? The towel? Did you...?
- What are you talking about, Neha?

147
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:33,709
I was out.
- He's gotten into the house!

148
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:36,275
Sweetheart, not a soul
knows we're here

149
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:39,387
It was his call last night.
And the ring..

150
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:41,220
..and the dress was
given to me by Jai!

151
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,750
I am telling you,
Jai is still alive.

152
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:45,759
He's not dead. He's not dead!

153
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:53,225
Relax! Relax!

154
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:55,398
Nothing can happen to you,
so long as I'm alive

155
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:28,236
Love you!

156
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,634
I've lost again.
- Again...?

157
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,274
So you want more money?

158
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:36,441
How much?
- So much

159
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,282
Good luck. - Thank you.

160
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:03,299
I need 60 million rupees

161
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:09,401
I desperately need 60 million.
Neha's in deep trouble, sir!

162
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:13,612
The underworld will kidnap her if
she doesn't have 60 million, sir

163
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:17,081
You're a large-hearted man, sir...
- Now listen to me, you sonofa...

164
00:26:17,354 --> 00:26:20,289
No, I don't want to listen to
anything. Just save my Neha, sir

165
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:23,787
I need 60 million, sir. When shall
I come to collect the money?

166
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:29,094
That's the problem.
I know you won't show up

167
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:32,795
Once. Just once, show
yourself to me...

168
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,302
and I'll solve all your problems

169
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:53,083
Honey...

170
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,950
we've reached home

171
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:10,967
I lost a big amount

172
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:12,965
You are angry, no?

173
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:15,034
No, it's all right.

174
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:17,505
I love you. - I love you, too.

175
00:27:58,355 --> 00:28:01,415
Where are you going?
- I'll just switch on the light

176
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:33,084
Well? Scared, are you?

177
00:28:33,424 --> 00:28:38,885
They fear, who have malicious
intent. You forgot so soon?

178
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:43,096
I have loved you like crazy.

179
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:46,096
Now I am going to
hate you like crazy.

180
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,753
You take so long to
open the door? - Hey, dude.

181
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:15,595
Clothes, and the works! There's
nothing more to shop for

182
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:20,092
I tell you something.

183
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,104
If you stay here any longer,
I'm gonna die of jealousy

184
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:25,436
Shut up.

185
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:26,703
Have you eaten?

186
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,269
Yeah, thanks.

187
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:31,605
Get ready soon, we're going
to the Rain Forest Café

188
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:35,880
Count me out.
- Your friend is strange

189
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:37,887
He's always refusing

190
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:41,655
No wonder he turned down
a lovely lady like you

191
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,487
What lovely? I'm plain stupid.

192
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,754
Had I not seen Vikram
and Neha at the mall...

193
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,821
I wouldn't have informed
Govind kaka

194
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:52,164
And you wouldn't have taken the
trouble and come here all the way

195
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,668
At least you'd have forgotten
that fraud of a girl

196
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,270
It is unbelievable.

197
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:59,274
You escaped the Indian police,
wasted your lifetime's savings...

198
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:02,278
got seriously injured, hid inside
the cargo space of a ship...

199
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:04,313
and journeyed for two whole months

200
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:07,109
You even defeated death
to fight with life, buddy

201
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:11,152
Man, this is a true
love story. - Love story?

202
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,424
Every love story has two names.

203
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:22,359
But mine has only one

204
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:26,163
Mine.

205
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:30,501
And I have pledged that name
to ruin and destroy her.

206
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:34,176
This is no love story.

207
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:37,178
This is a hate story.

208
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:42,545
Thank God that you are enjoying.

209
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:57,229
May I come with you?

210
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:02,617
Hello! - So, freak? - You..!?

211
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:06,359
Well? Does it hurt?

212
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:11,095
Had I wished, you'd have
found Neha's corpse

213
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,363
What do you want? Come
to the bloody point.

214
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,102
My life.
- What if I refuse?

215
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:17,367
What if Neha dies?

216
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:21,041
Do as I tell you. It's
in your interest

217
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:28,551
All right, Jai. Finally
you've defeated me

218
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:32,586
What am I to do?
- That what you did to me before

219
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:36,958
Confess to your crime
at the police station

220
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:41,587
Tell them that you are
the hacker, not I

221
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:44,496
How long can you use me as a shield
to save yourself from the cops?

222
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:49,637
The longer you talk, the sooner
I can trace you, swine

223
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,436
Go on

224
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:56,177
You started the game, I'll finish it

225
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:02,585
And yes... I'm not paying
you for this. Get it?

226
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,756
Yes, I get it

227
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:11,758
I got you. - Good.

228
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,435
Got you!

229
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,631
We've made a terrible
mistake, Vikram

230
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,769
We chose the wrong guy for this job

231
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:31,441
He won't spare us. He's going to
chase us till we breathe our last

232
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:37,479
He won't let us live,
Vikram. He won't

233
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:42,819
He won't let us live
only if he lives

234
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:52,166
Jai, this time I get you...
you're dead

235
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,888
Phoning me, eh?

236
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:29,501
You will whistle, eh?

237
00:35:42,152 --> 00:35:44,120
You'll enter our house, huh?

238
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:19,712
Last time, you landed in a hospital

239
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:25,886
Tonight, you are going
to the crematorium.

240
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:52,880
Found Jai?

241
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,655
Yes

242
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,955
Where's he?
- In the car

243
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:20,970
Babu Anna, 'your' computer hacker
is in Cape Town, alive

244
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:24,971
Is it? - I have sent him
to Elizabeth Hospital

245
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:26,681
He's all yours now

246
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,698
Congratulations on starting
afresh, Neha

247
00:39:24,874 --> 00:39:27,866
It's my duty to take care of
you as long as I breathe

248
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:32,708
I was madly in love with you.
Now I'm going to die for you

249
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:36,749
Have you found the 60 million?

250
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:57,862
Honey...

251
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,703
have soup

252
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,764
Drink? - No.

253
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:35,774
Are you ok?

254
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:37,773
Sure?

255
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:44,817
I'll get a sweater

256
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,890
No! NO!!!

257
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:44,299
Help!

258
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:51,169
Somebody help me!

259
00:43:01,024 --> 00:43:03,618
Jai, you are making a grave mistake

260
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:07,753
Have you gone mad?
- Yes, I have.

261
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:11,126
I went mad the moment you
stepped into my life

262
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,367
You looked at me, I went wild

263
00:43:17,574 --> 00:43:19,769
You spurned me, I
went mad with disappointment.

264
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:24,305
You accepted me,
I went mad with joy

265
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:28,414
And now I'm completely deranged

266
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:31,185
I can do anything with
you right now

267
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:35,524
But I won't do that, because
I'm not like you

268
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,188
You wanted my life, didn't you?

269
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:48,435
You should've asked me just once.
I'd have given it up with a smile

270
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:55,968
Help! Help! - Shut up!

271
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,977
Look at me!

272
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:01,975
You've ruined my life!

273
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:08,020
No! I'm not going to cry for you!

274
00:44:08,424 --> 00:44:12,360
Treacherous woman! Forget love.
I will not even cuss you

275
00:44:13,196 --> 00:44:15,528
No expletive can ever define you

276
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:20,026
C'mon.. come.

277
00:44:26,442 --> 00:44:28,034
Let me go

278
00:44:31,247 --> 00:44:34,080
Open the door, please

279
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:55,766
You have a table for Jai Malhotra?

280
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:57,100
Yeah, over there.

281
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:09,084
Sit

282
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,423
No fuming, please

283
00:45:19,696 --> 00:45:21,823
Anger is bad for health

284
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:26,900
Especially for Neha's health

285
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:31,437
Swine!
- Did I ask your name?

286
00:45:35,278 --> 00:45:37,109
Drink it up

287
00:45:37,313 --> 00:45:39,838
It'll cool down your heart and mind

288
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,108
Shut up!

289
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:48,150
Where is she?

290
00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:51,156
Still alive

291
00:45:51,828 --> 00:45:55,594
But after two hours... can't say

292
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:58,099
Should something happen to her...

293
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:03,768
What do you want?
- Your arrest

294
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:06,104
Confess to your crime

295
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:08,107
I agree

296
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:11,103
Good boy.

297
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:14,746
When will you surrender?
- When will you release Neha?

298
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:17,309
Surrender, and I'll let Neha go

299
00:46:17,487 --> 00:46:20,422
Let Neha go, and I'll surrender

300
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:28,826
I want to meet her one last
time, before I surrender

301
00:46:32,502 --> 00:46:33,560
Ok.

302
00:47:01,564 --> 00:47:04,158
She's inside

303
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,884
My mind is ruined waiting
in these ruins

304
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:27,221
Welcome

305
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,223
I'll settle this for good.
The final time.

306
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,227
Babu Anna? Here!?
- Come on

307
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:40,229
Hey, wait.

308
00:47:41,637 --> 00:47:43,229
Ok.

309
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:46,236
Hot stuff! Really

310
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,575
You make me feel like
I'm watching a movie

311
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:04,723
Let alone steal, one would
even kill for her

312
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:08,560
What kind of a man do you need?

313
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,028
Tell me. What do you see in a man?

314
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,231
I'd tell you only if you were a man

315
00:48:13,402 --> 00:48:15,233
What daring! What guts!

316
00:48:16,672 --> 00:48:18,230
Just like these guys? Right?

317
00:48:20,977 --> 00:48:23,969
If she falls she'll go wasted, no?

318
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:36,784
As soon as I traced the hospital,
I put my men on guard

319
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:39,288
But he vanished.

320
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:44,294
I came here all the way from India,
still no trace of him

321
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:48,969
But somehow my white dogs here..

322
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:53,097
sniffed this slink out

323
00:48:55,411 --> 00:48:57,242
You look different on TV.

324
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:01,280
Fiddling with the computer
you tried to fiddle with me

325
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:05,753
Tell me, how will you
return my money?

326
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:08,446
On-line transfer? Or cash?

327
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:09,785
I don't have the money

328
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:10,951
Then?

329
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:13,621
He has the money. He's the hacker.
- He's raving

330
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:17,029
No, it's the truth. He stole
the money and set me up

331
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:19,295
He is lying. - I am not
lying, I am telling the truth.

332
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:21,302
Stop raving.
- I'm not raving

333
00:49:22,705 --> 00:49:26,505
Mustn't fight in a foreign country

334
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:29,577
Brings our country to disrepute

335
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:32,808
You didn't steal the money?
- No

336
00:49:34,684 --> 00:49:36,618
Then you are of no use to me

337
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,956
Listen to me... if you kill me, you
will never get your money back

338
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:45,357
Because he'll thrust the
blame on me. - Right

339
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:48,554
So I'll blow him up

340
00:49:48,698 --> 00:49:52,361
No, not him. With him
goes your money too

341
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:59,097
Then there's only one
way out. The fish!

342
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:00,635
No wait.

343
00:50:00,843 --> 00:50:04,301
If you kill her, he'll
seal his lips forever

344
00:50:04,613 --> 00:50:07,104
Then am I to blow myself up?

345
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:11,319
To hell with the money!

346
00:50:12,955 --> 00:50:13,887
No!

347
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:16,356
Babu Anna! He's right

348
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:21,359
I'm the hacker

349
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:24,365
You are on track now

350
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:26,364
Come with me

351
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,106
See... everything is
set. Get cracking

352
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:48,480
Goodness! It goes over my head

353
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:53,759
During my time, it was simple.
Loot at gunpoint

354
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:55,828
Very easy

355
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,483
Processing will take around 5-7
minutes. In the meantime...

356
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,482
I'd like to fix him

357
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:26,552
Scoundrels! You conned me

358
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:29,550
You swallowed my money! I'll
make you puke it all now

359
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:33,560
Bloody dogs!

360
00:52:33,896 --> 00:52:35,557
I'm not sparing you!

361
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:40,566
I'll carve you! I'll finish you off

362
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:04,556
Thanks - What thanks?
I saved you only..

363
00:53:04,627 --> 00:53:07,357
..because your life means
freedom to me. Come now.

364
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:09,558
You'll die

365
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:11,566
Let's see

366
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:47,792
Stay down there, you will live

367
00:54:31,213 --> 00:54:33,181
Stay right there! If you
get up this time...

368
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:35,848
I'll dispatch you

369
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,642
I want my life back!

370
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,637
Give me my life back.

371
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:09,317
Neha and you ruined my life

372
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:13,682
I will kill you.

373
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,689
You will send me to jail, eh?

374
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:19,858
The two of you made
a mockery of my love

375
00:55:29,038 --> 00:55:34,704
Kill him, Vikram. Finish him off!

376
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:11,746
You are finished.

377
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:16,916
You have two or at the
most five minutes on you.

378
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:24,351
Don't be mean, Vikram. Poor thing.

379
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,751
You forgot? Last time
too we thought the same

380
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,264
Why did you return? Who needs you?

381
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,364
True. How long will this go on?

382
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,568
I keep the strike, while
you keep losing

383
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,311
You are such a loser, Jai.

384
00:56:46,415 --> 00:56:48,440
Actually, he's not
at fault, Vikram

385
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:54,044
He loves me so dearly that
it's hard to just quit

386
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:58,916
Besides, he did all
this for my sake

387
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:00,751
So sweet of him, no?

388
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:02,763
But you know what?

389
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:05,266
I feel nothing for you

390
00:57:06,835 --> 00:57:08,769
No love...

391
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:10,768
neither empathy...

392
00:57:11,273 --> 00:57:12,763
nor mercy

393
00:57:14,843 --> 00:57:16,777
I am sorry, Jai.

394
00:57:29,425 --> 00:57:32,553
Feel nothing? Do you
even have a heart?

395
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:40,827
You keep the strike,
while I keep losing

396
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:47,365
Let's try that one last time. Let's
see who strikes and who dies

397
00:58:04,493 --> 00:58:05,824
No! Neha! No!

398
00:58:09,164 --> 00:58:10,825
My love...

399
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:24,467
The slut deserved it

400
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:28,507
Yesterday she left me,
today she deserted you

401
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:31,843
But I must say...

402
00:58:33,155 --> 00:58:34,884
she left after settling our scores

403
00:58:36,158 --> 00:58:40,151
Yesterday, I had love. No money

404
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:45,429
Today, you have money. No love

405
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,408
5.5 billion is your stake...

406
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:57,838
but every day you will remember me

407
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,843
Enjoy!

408
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:36,084
At a time when the world buckles
under treachery, corruption...

409
00:59:36,184 --> 00:59:37,947
communal disharmony and greed..

410
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,351
..philanthropy and humanity
still survives somewhere

411
00:59:39,555 --> 00:59:42,547
Which has been proved
by a mysterious angel

412
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:45,115
This mysterious person has
donated nearly 5 billion...

413
00:59:45,193 --> 00:59:48,685
to the Missionaries
of Charity in Mumbai

414
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:53,133
In an exclusive interview, the
Chief Minister told Zee News that...

415
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:57,570
the country needs such compassionate
and benevolent citizens...

416
00:59:57,906 --> 01:00:01,069
who, unhesitatingly perform their
duties towards the society...

417
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:04,635
by staying low profile and
have no political motives

418
01:00:05,113 --> 01:00:08,344
Though nobody knows who the
magnanimous person is...

419
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:12,547
one thing is certain. He will
receive the blessings of millions
