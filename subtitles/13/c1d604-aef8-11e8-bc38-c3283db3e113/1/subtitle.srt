00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,632
Welcome to Zee News.

2
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,793
A look at the top story of the day.

3
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:14,640
The Mumbai police are on
the horns of a dilemma...

4
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:20,647
because of an unusual bank robbery.
An internet hacker has succeeded...

5
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:26,175
in siphoning off 5.5 billion
rupees from two bank accounts

6
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:28,687
According to our sources,
both companies belong...

7
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:31,691
to the underworld don
of Mumbai, Babu Anna...

8
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,694
who uses the companies as a front
for his illegal activities

9
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:37,697
What remains to be seen
is whether the police..

10
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:41,701
..get the internet
mastermind first..

11
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,705
..or the don who finds himself
swindled out of his savings

12
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:39,753
Damn it!

13
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:41,260
What happened to Anna?

14
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:53,762
A match... a match!

15
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:01,207
Light it up! Set me
on fire! Light it up!

16
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,749
No, Anna...
- Finish me!

17
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,755
I'm a dog! A mad dog! A cur!

18
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,084
Babu Anna's money gets robbed!
Babu Anna's!

19
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:20,097
All right if he's robbed it. But
where's he going to spend it?

20
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,102
On his family, Anna.
- Family...?

21
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,765
No way! Who could he
have in his family?

22
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,775
His father, his mother...
- Carve his father out

23
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:35,281
Burn his mother alive! And hack
his brother to tiny pieces!

24
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:36,940
As for his sister...

25
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:42,318
set Yeda Yadav after her! Look
at how I hit out at him!

26
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:48,325
When I hit him, forget
touching my money...

27
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,829
that swine won't even
be able to sniff at it!

28
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:53,332
I want that dog here!

29
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,337
Girish! Your responsibility.
I want that dog here!

30
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:00,771
You get that?
- Right on, Anna

31
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:09,805
Yes sir. Six computer experts have
been busy tracing him all night, sir

32
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:13,944
Can't say for sure... yes, I'll
report first to you, sir

33
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,791
Chavan, what's happening on
the internet robbery case?

34
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:21,483
It's taking a bit of time,
sir. The systems...

35
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:22,995
Don't give me excuses.

36
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,827
The pressure's mounting
every minute

37
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,164
Find out who he is and
where he is holed up!

38
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,885
'My eyes...'

39
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:23,216
'seek her...'

40
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,386
'everywhere I look'

41
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:37,893
'One day, she will
come right upto me'

42
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:45,241
'Her charms have made
a romantic out of me'

43
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:53,078
'She's the one who appears in my
dreams and makes them rosier'

44
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:56,950
'She hasn't a clue,
she's ignorant...'

45
00:07:57,024 --> 00:08:01,051
'how bowled over
I am by her charms'

46
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:56,972
'Never before have
I experienced this'

47
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:03,922
'I have no idea how it all happened'

48
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:12,454
'My obsession is nothing but the
effect of your love, sweetheart'

49
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:09,419
'She must've never have
seen someone as crazy'

50
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:17,089
'It's this fancyfree nature of mine
that shall win her over some day'

51
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:25,099
'I've never seen such a romance, nor
have I seen someone as crazy'

52
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:29,108
'In your heart is now my dwelling'

53
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:32,771
'Somewhere, some day...'

54
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:41,151
'I will find my heart-throb'

55
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,150
How much?
- 3 rupees

56
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:17,150
Keep the change.

57
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:49,886
Let me go.
- Let you go?

58
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:51,514
After you give me your licence

59
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,559
That girl ahead will go away.
- Girl?

60
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:55,561
Had heard about the
wife and the other one.

61
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,392
But first time I am hearing about
the ahead one and the behind one.

62
00:11:57,564 --> 00:12:00,829
You have a bike. So why
do you need a babe?

63
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,335
You youngsters are real flirts

64
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:08,497
She is the one. I am telling you,
it is absolutely amazing.

65
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,668
And that cop sprang there!

66
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,176
The girl I could only dream
of was actually there!

67
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:15,839
Right there in front
of me! I mean...

68
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,883
I mean.. - What the heck.
- You know Sonia..

69
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:21,216
I'm sure she'd have recognised
me too, if she had seen me

70
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:26,555
She'd have felt just as I felt! I'm
telling you, I can't believe it!

71
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,218
That I have found her.
She is the one!

72
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:30,889
I want to meet her, talk to her...
- Stupid!

73
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:33,228
You haven't told me about the
car deal. What happened..

74
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,234
..about the BMW and Mercedes?

75
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:36,894
Oh yes, that was finalised
last night.

76
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,234
That too in 2.5 million.. cash!

77
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,900
Forget all that! You're
not listening, Sonia!

78
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:43,408
I have found her.

79
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:46,241
She's in this very city! I
saw her in flesh and blood!

80
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:49,578
I want to meet her. Talk to her.

81
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:51,913
But these cops are
really too much.

82
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:54,246
Hey, just listen to me.

83
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:58,290
My wait has actually come to an end.
How I wish I could meet her once

84
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,220
Guess what, Jai? Dad asked
me to marry that guy..

85
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:04,889
..again and I turned him down

86
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:08,230
Only because I happen
to be waiting...

87
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:12,237
for this stupid boy
to propose to me!

88
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,239
You did right. Excellent!

89
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:18,243
You.. - Hey.. ok, relax.

90
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:22,241
Shut up and listen
carefully, you stupid.

91
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:28,276
There's no one else in your
life. There's only me

92
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:37,296
Sonia is my best friend.

93
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:40,623
But my heart's bowled over by her

94
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:56,315
I love you, Jai!

95
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:41,854
Hang on!

96
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,862
Jai... what happened?

97
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,370
Hello, brother.
- Hello, son. How're you doing?

98
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:33,036
Very well. Tell me, sir..

99
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:34,375
Which Gurudwara is this
procession coming from?

100
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:37,382
The Singh Sabha Gurudwara.
- Sat Sri Akal

101
00:15:55,502 --> 00:16:00,701
Lord, my pledge of 40 days'
fast comes to an end today

102
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:04,710
Heed my prayer, Lord.
Please grant me my wish

103
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,758
Please wear them.
- But...

104
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:28,926
Go on. I'm doing service.
- Service?

105
00:16:29,102 --> 00:16:32,435
Yes. I'm doing service
with a wish...

106
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,770
that I find the one I love

107
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:37,104
How sweet!

108
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:39,441
You will surely find her

109
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:42,447
Because the wish you seek with
a true heart, is always granted

110
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,776
Wear your footwear

111
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,775
Are you Neha?
- Yes

112
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:30,489
Neha madam...?

113
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:33,498
Who's been sending this...?
- I don't know

114
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,509
Oh God!

115
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,513
Now look...

116
00:18:02,562 --> 00:18:05,497
You? Is it from the Gurudwara?

117
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:11,503
Oh no! Not from the Gurudwara!
- So then...?

118
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,833
Believe me, I've never done
a thing like this ever before

119
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:19,839
But I'm not afraid to do it

120
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,846
They fear, who have
malicious intentions

121
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,510
I love you, Neha.

122
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:32,222
That's exactly how I reacted when
I saw you in person 3 days ago

123
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,884
And I fell in love with you

124
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,554
And then I saw you in a
salwar-kameez for the first time...

125
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,565
See..? I still can't control myself

126
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,067
Look, you aren't...?
- I know, I know

127
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:47,072
It isn't easy for a girl to
make a decision so quickly

128
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,075
You need time, isn't it?
No problem, I'll wait

129
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:56,075
But just two hours, okay? Because
I can't wait any longer

130
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:58,616
See you two hours later then

131
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,619
China Love!

132
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:03,884
You will come and put
your arms around me...

133
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:05,515
and say that you love me.

134
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:13,560
Ok, bye! You are so beautiful! Bye.

135
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:28,575
Have a really good time tonight.
Keep this party going at China Love.

136
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,247
She is coming.
- Who?

137
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:39,620
Neha

138
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,958
Today, I professed my love to her.
- Then?

139
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,632
I gave her time to think.
All of two hours

140
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,635
Two hours! Wow!

141
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:53,638
I know it's too short a notice,
but I can't help it

142
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:56,300
I can't live more than two
hours without her. Sonia...

143
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:57,968
I'm sure she'll come

144
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:02,971
She will give me a hug and
say that she loves me

145
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,978
Whatever!

146
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:57,759
'I...'

147
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:00,099
'you...'

148
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,701
'love...'

149
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:04,709
'and the rising desires'

150
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:06,701
'And love starts now!'

151
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:11,374
'Come to me, my love'

152
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:12,712
'That's right.'

153
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,423
'I, you, romance, love...'

154
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:25,260
'and the rising desires!
Come to me, my love'

155
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:26,764
'Sweetheart...'

156
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,097
'what have you done?'

157
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:34,273
'I've given my heart to you'

158
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,109
'With those gazes and sweet words
you've stolen my heart away'

159
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:52,817
'Come my love, let's shake a leg.'

160
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:55,887
'I am...'

161
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:57,889
'lost...'

162
00:22:57,957 --> 00:22:59,891
'in your love'

163
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:05,159
'So lost...'

164
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,827
'that I care...'

165
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,163
'for none else'

166
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:14,332
'When my anklets chime, he
pines... it's inebriating'

167
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:18,844
'Come my love, let's shake a leg.'

168
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,890
'My heart...'

169
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,552
'throbs...'

170
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,892
'as desires...'

171
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,897
'well up'

172
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:17,231
'I'd die for you...'

173
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:19,396
'my love'

174
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,906
'You are the girl of my
dreams, you invade..

175
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,908
..my heart... love is a delight'

176
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:28,913
'Come my love, let's shake a leg.'

177
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:35,283
'I...'

178
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:38,289
'you...'

179
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,291
'love...'

180
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,224
'and the rising...
- desires'

181
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:44,957
'Love..'

182
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:46,965
'..starts now.'

183
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,961
'Come to me, my love'

184
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:50,969
'Sweetheart...'

185
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:52,965
'what have you done?'

186
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,306
'I've given my heart to you'

187
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:02,905
'With those gazes and sweet words
you've stolen my heart away'

188
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:31,306
You thought she'd come,
give you a hug...

189
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:34,972
and tell you that she loves you

190
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:38,977
Only a stupid girl would
do that with you

191
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:40,518
That's me

192
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,517
Now, c'mon. Let's go.

193
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:44,349
C'mon, Jai.

194
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,043
You...?
- You didn't come...?

195
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:44,572
I kept waiting for you since nine,
but you didn't turn up

196
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:47,045
Are you insane?

197
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:50,088
I've been insane ever since
I saw you, never before

198
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:52,090
Neha, I've decided...

199
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,424
I really love you, Neha.
- O God! Please.

200
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,527
O my God! Then..

201
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:05,035
Then?

202
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:08,369
What else? He kept on raving, and
I slammed the door in his face

203
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:10,033
What a crazy guy!

204
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:14,035
Whatever you say, he seems
to be very interesting

205
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,043
Do such lovers exist in real life?

206
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:21,045
I've never...

207
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:23,587
Is it him? He is so cute!

208
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:35,759
You may think I'm crazy,
and I really am

209
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:40,098
I know, I've been quite a pest

210
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:43,107
And, last night I even
came to your house...

211
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:45,109
I shouldn't have done that.
I am sorry for that.

212
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:49,113
But I can't help it. When it comes
to you, I've no control over myself

213
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:52,610
Excuse me, bill please.

214
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:58,656
Look probably.. - Thank you.

215
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:01,084
Probably...

216
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,594
I'm bad at displaying it,
but my love for you is true

217
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:06,096
And I can do anything to prove it

218
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:08,088
Now you will say that..

219
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,429
you can down the moon and the
stars for me...

220
00:28:09,502 --> 00:28:11,436
Will jump off the highest cliff...

221
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:14,439
Will even give up your life for me.

222
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:20,105
If that would convince
you, I'll do it

223
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:23,108
Very good.

224
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:25,150
What are you waiting for?

225
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:30,154
All right! I was madly
in love with you...

226
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,156
now I'm going to die for you

227
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:37,656
Ok, best of luck.

228
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:45,894
Greetings! Welcome to our viewers.

229
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:50,231
Here are the headlines.

230
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:57,406
Neha Mehra? - Yes.

231
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:59,740
Who do you think you are?
- Excuse me.

232
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,910
Your good looks...

233
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:05,246
don't give you the right to
play with someone's life

234
00:30:06,352 --> 00:30:08,411
I've never seen Jai like this

235
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:12,287
His parents passed away when
he was nine. Do you know?

236
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:18,957
Yet, he worked his way up on his
own, From the age of nine years.

237
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:21,293
And now...

238
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:25,303
he's paying a heavy price
for not understanding you

239
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:31,299
Meaning? - Jai took an overdose
of sedatives...

240
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:33,311
and tried to kill himself - What?

241
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,339
If something happens to
him.. Its your fault.

242
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,362
Govind kaka, did you
get the medicines?

243
00:30:57,436 --> 00:31:00,371
Excuse me, you can relax now.

244
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:02,634
We've removed even the last
traces of the pills

245
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,300
He is out of danger.

246
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:07,311
Can I see him?
- Not now

247
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,813
I don't think he'll come
around before morning

248
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:12,349
Ok, thank you so much, doctor.

249
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,755
You are really crazy

250
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:59,760
I don't believe, for my sake,
someone would...

251
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:04,367
I feel as if I've
got a new identity

252
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:07,365
Someone loves me so much

253
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,878
If I turn him down, no one will be
more insane than me in this world.

254
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:18,709
I love you, Jai.

255
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:21,419
I have never said that before

256
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:26,919
But I felt no fear in saying
it for the first time today

257
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:30,758
They fear, who have
malicious intentions

258
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:37,765
Such decisions aren't
taken in haste, I know

259
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:41,433
I'm not in a hurry

260
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:43,941
I will wait.

261
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:50,448
I'll give you...

262
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:52,484
two seconds

263
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:54,779
I love you, Jai!

264
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:27,985
'O heart of mine...'

265
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:32,490
'wait no more'

266
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,842
'If you are in love...'

267
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,510
'express it'

268
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:11,489
'O heart of mine...'

269
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:16,000
'wait no more'

270
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:37,511
'If you are in love...'

271
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,063
'I love you.. love you, like crazy.'

272
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:56,574
'I want you.. want you, like crazy.'

273
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:26,894
'I won't let you...'

274
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:29,236
'belong to another'

275
00:35:29,308 --> 00:35:34,575
'You mean the very life to me'

276
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:39,606
'You are the story...'

277
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:44,952
'I read all night, all day'

278
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:50,120
'I believe you'

279
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:54,962
'Let me give you the comfort
of my arms...'

280
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,625
'come to me'

281
00:35:57,703 --> 00:36:07,578
'Dear Life wants me to give
up my life for Her'

282
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:13,242
'If you are in love...'

283
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:16,082
'express it'

284
00:36:26,298 --> 00:36:31,292
'I love you.. love you, like crazy.'

285
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:36,637
'I want you.. want you, like crazy.'

286
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:13,974
'There's none crazier than you'

287
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:19,143
'I've given in to your obstinacy'

288
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:21,685
'My love...'

289
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:24,187
'I know...'

290
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:29,694
'I make you restless'

291
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:34,698
'In my thoughts, in my dreams,
you shall dwell'

292
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:39,203
'I shall hold you in my eyes'

293
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:41,705
'Come to me'

294
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,704
'My love...'

295
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:51,738
'trust me'

296
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:58,056
'If you are in love...'

297
00:37:58,156 --> 00:38:00,681
'express it'

298
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,769
Jai, I need to tell you something

299
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:47,270
Go on

300
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,100
You know Sonia, it's amazing.

301
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:55,112
Ever since I met Neha, I've
cared least for time

302
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,115
At times I feel it flies,
at times I feel it stops

303
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:03,082
See, I have to meet her in an hour,
but the clock just won't tick away

304
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:06,755
What's going to happen of you?
- Nothing

305
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:09,760
I'll work hard for a few
years, earn enough...

306
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:13,093
and then I'll marry her and
have seven or eight kids

307
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:15,759
Seven or eight? Is that all?
- Yes, don't I need to work?

308
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:18,098
But I'll send them over
to you for stories

309
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,103
Okay, so I'll be their nanny?
- Right

310
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:22,265
Forget it, Jai.

311
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,104
It's going to prove you costly.
- Why?

312
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,102
Because I'm going to London, Jai

313
00:39:29,114 --> 00:39:30,775
I've decided to marry

314
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:36,776
Why London? You could
get suitors here too

315
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,822
I'll talk to your parents...
- No Jai

316
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:46,159
I relate every place, every
thing in this city with you

317
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,157
I may stay away from you, but I
can't tear myself apart from you

318
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,835
I must go now... else I'll
miss my flight, too

319
00:39:58,176 --> 00:39:59,837
You are...

320
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,174
leaving right now?

321
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:05,843
And you tell me now?
- Had I told you earlier...

322
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,885
I might've given in
to your reasoning

323
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:15,888
I know, you think I'm selfish

324
00:40:16,228 --> 00:40:20,892
But today... please
let me be selfish

325
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:25,397
Let me escort you to the airport.
- No

326
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:27,899
I'll go alone

327
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:29,907
You are not going alone that far.
- No, Jai

328
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:33,234
Please don't make it
more difficult for me

329
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,452
I will miss you.

330
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:44,949
I love you.

331
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:52,958
Bye. - Stupid.

332
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:25,291
Neha...?

333
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:45,980
What are you doing?
Neha, what are you..

334
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:59,023
Have you gone mad, Neha?
What's happening here?

335
00:41:59,097 --> 00:42:01,964
What's the matter?
- I...

336
00:42:06,238 --> 00:42:07,296
What is it?

337
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:24,311
How would you know that you're in
love with a criminal's daughter?

338
00:42:27,092 --> 00:42:29,356
A criminal?
- Yes

339
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:39,031
Daddy's no more. But he left
making life difficult for me.

340
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:42,039
What does that mean?

341
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,046
Daddy had borrowed money
from the underworld...

342
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:51,048
and now, they're following me

343
00:42:53,418 --> 00:42:57,047
Till now, they only kept
threatening me. But now...

344
00:42:57,155 --> 00:43:02,024
they say that if I don't return
their money within 3 days, they will...

345
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:09,032
they will kidnap me.
- Who do they think they are?

346
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:13,030
They're like the wolves,
Jai. I don't..

347
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:17,040
..want to fall in their
hands. So I...

348
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:23,046
Didn't you consider for
a moment what would..

349
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:26,083
..happen of me if you were harmed?

350
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,754
Don't worry. Just tell me
where I will find them

351
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:37,420
They're very dangerous, Jai. I did
all I could to repay them, but...

352
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:42,432
Don't worry, I can really help. I
have the money. 2.5 million in cash

353
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:50,102
It isn't so little.
I owe them 60 million.

354
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:02,044
Neha, everything is going to be fine.

355
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:05,088
I'll deal with everything.
You don't worry

356
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:18,095
It's five years old,
but thank God...

357
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:24,108
you've maintained it rather well.
You also have a 24-hour water supply

358
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:27,110
Got to sell immediately, right?
So, thank God...

359
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:30,443
it'll fetch at least 8 million.
Is that okay?

360
00:44:31,216 --> 00:44:33,150
Don't worry.

361
00:44:34,486 --> 00:44:38,115
Nice, nice... looks solid

362
00:44:39,491 --> 00:44:44,155
Facing the West. Also
has a nice sea-view?

363
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:47,824
Can we get a glimpse of
the sea from here? - No

364
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:50,163
No? From the terrace?

365
00:44:50,502 --> 00:44:53,164
No harm in saying you can

366
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:57,669
Since it's the ground floor,
security is good enough

367
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:04,448
This is a weak lock, I say. But
that's okay. I'll handle it

368
00:45:04,549 --> 00:45:08,610
Actually, I have a buyer.
And cash won't be a problem

369
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:12,149
I'm sure it'll get sold at 5 million

370
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:14,157
You want me to negotiate?

371
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:18,826
60 million? You can't be serious!

372
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,166
You say 60 millions as if you
were borrowing my car for 6 days

373
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:30,173
60 million. Only
one way of raising that..

374
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,175
..type of money in
such a short time

375
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:34,177
Go and rob a bank!

376
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:39,205
Stop joking.
- Sorry, sorry.... but 60 million?!

377
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:42,845
Are you mad? You will rob a bank...?

378
00:45:42,954 --> 00:45:46,219
What else can we do? We
have no other choice

379
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:54,221
Your house and mine and our belongings
won't fetch more than 20 million.

380
00:45:56,568 --> 00:45:59,230
I know what I'll do. I'll go to
the bank tomorrow morning and...

381
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:03,166
Really...? By the way, which
bank do you propose to rob?

382
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:08,673
Standard Chartered Bank, Bandra.
Now listen to me, Neha

383
00:46:09,514 --> 00:46:13,177
I know what I'm doing is wrong.
But we have no other choice

384
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:16,179
To raise 60 million in just
two days... think about it

385
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:22,225
We've tried everything, we...
- Rather I die than do this, Jai

386
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:27,721
Listen to me, Neha

387
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,234
Neha, just stop.

388
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:39,242
Promise me, you won't even joke
about such a thing again

389
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:45,747
If something happens to you... -
Okay. The bank robbery's off. Okay?

390
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:33,290
Five guards during the day. Must
at least be 3 during the night

391
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:35,798
Looks pretty difficult

392
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:43,301
Mr. Vikram, it's great pleasure
to be of service to you.

393
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:49,313
What urgency makes you withdraw
70 million in one go?

394
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,339
No problem. The bank is
yours. So are we...

395
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:57,684
and most important, the
money's yours too!

396
00:47:58,022 --> 00:48:02,959
Thank you for using our services.

397
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:06,292
This is the first time we're handling
such a big wire-transfer for you

398
00:48:06,364 --> 00:48:09,299
I hope you will give us
the opportunity to..

399
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:12,803
..do many more wire-transfers
for you

400
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,304
Thank you very much.

401
00:48:35,026 --> 00:48:37,358
Seems I won't be required to
break the promise made to Neha.

402
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:40,363
Now not the bank but
he is going to get robbed.

403
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:46,105
You look well-bred. Why
did you come here?

404
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:50,620
To steal

405
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:52,622
I see

406
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:57,621
I went to rob the bank and saw
you withdrawing the money

407
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:00,624
Thought I'd rob it from you

408
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:10,567
Robbing the bank was much
easier, wasn't it?

409
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,571
Please, come in.

410
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:28,625
What if you had got killed?

411
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:32,623
That's okay

412
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,634
I don't care for my life

413
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:39,630
I'd at least have got 60 million.

414
00:52:42,974 --> 00:52:44,635
Why do you need the money?

415
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:46,643
I don't consider it
necessary to tell you

416
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:48,645
That's my problem.

417
00:52:51,749 --> 00:52:57,688
All right, you can tell
the cops when they arrive

418
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:19,636
Have some juice. - No thanks.

419
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:22,645
Have it. It's said
to be good for health

420
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:27,644
Sit down

421
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:43,700
It was six months ago that I
saw Neha for the first time..

422
00:53:59,817 --> 00:54:03,685
Interesting.. very very interesting.

423
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:11,688
Let's say I give it to you.
I give you 60 million

424
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:20,703
But what can I give you in return?

425
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:22,705
Your life

426
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:25,708
Something you don't care for, right?

427
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:30,713
Which means...?

428
00:54:33,084 --> 00:54:36,713
Now look, Jai. There's
no going back after..

429
00:54:36,821 --> 00:54:39,756
..I tell you what I
am about to tell you.

430
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:42,759
So think it over and...
- I'm prepared to do anything

431
00:54:42,827 --> 00:54:46,763
But I need the money. In 24 hours

432
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,097
Are you sure? - Yeah.

433
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:55,764
So listen. Maybe you've heard
of the internet robbery case?

434
00:54:56,107 --> 00:54:59,270
Yes, in which someone
stole 5.5 billion..

435
00:54:59,343 --> 00:55:01,208
..from Babu Anna's account, right?

436
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:07,711
For 60 million, you must claim
to be the computer hacker...

437
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:12,755
and turn yourself over to
the police. - But what..

438
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:14,757
..will you gain out of it?

439
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:16,753
Gain?

440
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:25,758
I'll be rid of the fear of getting
caught or dying at Babu Anna's hands

441
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:30,271
Because I am the computer
hacker, Jai

442
00:55:34,445 --> 00:55:37,778
I've committed a crime in
my lust for wealth...

443
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:41,807
but I've lost my sleep
and peace of mind

444
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:51,322
You were willing to lose your
life for 60 million, Jai

445
00:55:53,898 --> 00:55:55,832
Now you've only got
to serve a sentence

446
00:56:05,843 --> 00:56:07,777
What are you thinking about, Jai?

447
00:56:11,882 --> 00:56:15,318
Okay, not 60 million. I'll
give you 70 million...

448
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:20,317
to spend the rest of your life,
after your imprisonment

449
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:21,824
I agree

450
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:24,827
Good boy.

451
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:28,160
But I need just 60
million and not 70.

452
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,834
All right. suit yourself

453
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:36,168
When are you going to surrender?
- When are you going to pay me?

454
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:40,333
Surrender. And you
will have the money

455
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:42,845
Give me the money.
And I'll surrender

456
00:56:47,218 --> 00:56:49,345
Ok, fair enough.

457
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:55,392
I think I can trust you
Where will you go anyway?

458
00:56:57,962 --> 00:57:02,160
Let's go inside. It takes a hell of
a lot of time to count 60 million.

459
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:10,840
Throw this money in their face

460
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:16,846
So much of money...? How?

461
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:20,883
I've mortgaged my life to someone

462
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:27,890
You think your boyfriend
is worth nothing!

463
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,892
Been dealing in imported
cars for 3 years now..

464
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,894
..I command respect too, no?

465
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:35,892
All in one night...?

466
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:41,398
One moment. You haven't really
robbed the bank...?

467
00:57:41,472 --> 00:57:43,906
Swear it on you!
I didn't rob the bank

468
00:57:45,242 --> 00:57:47,233
You've sworn on me.
- Sworn on you

469
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:48,903
I didn't rob the bank. Okay?

470
00:57:48,979 --> 00:57:51,413
How we will we repay
such a huge debt?

471
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:59,283
This is nothing. I'd give my
life for you, if I had to

472
00:58:00,024 --> 00:58:04,893
For as long as I live, it's
my duty to look after you

473
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:10,559
Why must you talk about dying?
Our lives have only just begun

474
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:18,902
What's that?

475
00:58:22,246 --> 00:58:26,410
Keep it with you forever.
And whatever happens...

476
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:30,913
remember, I'm always with you

477
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:43,960
I love you, Jai.

478
00:58:46,036 --> 00:58:48,129
I'm very scared, Jai

479
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:54,300
I feel as if you're hiding
something from me

480
00:58:57,047 --> 00:59:00,016
Silly girl. Have I
ever lied to you?
