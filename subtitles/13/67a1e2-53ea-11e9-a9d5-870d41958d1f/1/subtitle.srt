a film by LEE, Eon-Hee

10
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,285
Why do you get so excited
every time you see the ballet?

11
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,598
Isn't it awesome?

12
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,767
I wish I could see one live
just once

13
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,203
I wonder if this troupe will
come to Korea?

14
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,773
How would you like to go see it
over there?

15
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,274
- Really?
- Really!

16
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,715
- We're going to Europe, then?
- Yes

17
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,750
And we're really seeing
the ballet, too?

18
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,442
Let's watch it
until we're sick of it

19
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,286
- Then how about your restaurant?
- I sold it

20
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,155
- What?
- To go to Europe

21
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,657
Really?

22
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,251
No! Lies, lies!

23
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,524
All are lies!

24
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,292
What a liar!

25
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,008
Want me to prepare
a bath for you?

26
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,577
Sounds good

27
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,009
- Did you bring your medicine?
- Yes, here

28
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,876
Did someone move in?

29
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,577
Get in the house
I'm going

30
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,188
Didn't you forget something?

31
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,293
- You're insatiable
- That's an expression of affection

32
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,992
Why don't you
get a boyfriend?

33
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,605
What a hopeless class this is!

34
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,715
Teacher, please help
us wake up

35
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,374
You come on up here

36
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,482
I'll wake you up with
a slap to the head

37
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,985
Teacher, please tell us about
your first love!

38
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,387
Haven't you loved someone
like the crossing guard did?

39
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:05,732
Oh, you poor girls, do you
really believe that story?

40
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,498
Stop talking and
write this down

41
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,556
A 100-day anniversary ring

42
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,198
How are you doing in class?

43
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,596
It's okay

44
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,762
Because as you came in the
middle of the semester

45
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,066
it won't be easy to get along
But they'll be friendly soon

46
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,674
Don't worry too much

47
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,367
I guess she's Mina?

48
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,050
Don't hesitate to tell me

49
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,345
if you feel uncomfortable

50
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,454
And ask me anything
if you want

51
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,917
Now, go!

52
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,263
Well...

53
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,265
I have one question

54
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,766
You mean about Kisu
the crossing guard?

55
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,875
Oh, Ki-Su?
The man with the flags

56
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,671
in front of the school?

57
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,781
When he was in high school

58
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,042
he liked a girl in our school

59
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,549
And one rainy day

60
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,347
when Ki-su
was waiting for her

61
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:40,050
she was run over while crossing
the street and killed

62
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,355
Since then, he has stood in front
of our school, directing traffic

63
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,363
Crying when it's raining

64
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,764
Isn't that just a made-up story
that students tell?

65
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,564
Yes, I guess so

66
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,255
- Excuse me, White wine, please
- Yes, just a moment

67
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,166
Juk-ja asked a fortuneteller

68
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,964
if she would find a boyfriend
before she died

69
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,163
The oracle said

70
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,866
she would find
a boyfriend that winter

71
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,968
So Jin-ju asked
the same question,

72
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,080
and the fortuneteller said

73
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,650
Why don't you just
watch TV drama instead?

74
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,650
Being in love
is a nice thing, isn't it?

75
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,952
You don't get hungry nor cold
even when you don't eat in winter

76
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,961
You are right, We had
those days too, didn't we?

77
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,570
- Misuk
- What?

78
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,269
You know about Mina

79
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,180
Don't say anything
if it's about Mina

80
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,046
I've thought about it enough

81
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,553
But still, why isn't she
in the hospital?

82
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,453
There's no cure for her

83
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,958
So, why stay
in the hospital?

84
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,358
But there could be
a miracle

85
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,556
Miracle? Yes, there could be...

86
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,167
But I think it already was a miracle
that Mina has lived until now

87
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:39,472
Mina has been in and out of the
hospital since she was born

88
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,639
with operations and injections

89
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,752
all over her body

90
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,954
Now they say
there's no more hope

91
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,149
I can't make her
suffer more

92
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,351
for her few last months

93
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,860
You sure you won't regret it
after Mina's gone?

94
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:09,469
Then, I will drink cry

95
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,876
and I'll call you

96
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,944
Oh gees, you!
Are you watching that again?

97
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,953
It's so embarrassing

98
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,147
What?

99
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,349
Naked guys dancing like that...

100
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,155
I don't know where to look

101
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,262
Just don't look down there

102
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,664
How? I just keep looking there

103
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,568
Protruding... and so noticeable

104
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,073
I think I'm still a woman, too

105
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,039
I'm leaving

106
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,645
Lock your door

107
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,892
I'm sorry, did it hurt?
I'll get you some medicine

108
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,147
Hello?

109
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,052
Hello?

110
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,259
Look down here!

111
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,564
Hey! Look! Look!

112
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,065
Look down here!

113
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,642
Look right here!
Can't you see me?

114
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,755
Can I get a cigarette?

115
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,747
Cigarette!

116
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,452
Take off your headphones

117
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,563
and look at me!

118
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,204
Will you give me a cigarette?

119
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,970
I'll pay you double

120
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,416
I just moved in downstairs

121
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,228
Shouldn't you say, "Nice to meet
you", or something like that?

122
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,059
Give me a light, too!

123
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,065
No lighter?

124
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,572
I'll return it as soon as I use it

125
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,353
This is interesting
Isn't it a navy insignia?

126
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,988
- Throw it to me
- Next time

127
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,149
Hello

128
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,049
Hello

129
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,851
I just moved
into downstairs

130
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,653
Nice to meet you

131
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,953
Oh, I see

132
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,360
Thank you about yesterday
I'll give it back to you soon

133
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,469
- Did you lend him something?
- Er... yes

134
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,072
Isn't he handsome?

135
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,072
You weren't looking
at his face, I guess

136
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,677
Come on, he's
exactly your type

137
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,779
You can have him if you
like him that much

138
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,145
Don't bs me

139
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,558
Oh, I got a present for you
in the back seat

140
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,961
A present?

141
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,079
- A cellular phone?
- Why, you don't like it?

142
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,164
Hello...

143
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,362
What?

144
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,163
Since this is your first time
I'll give you a break

145
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,070
If you call me for no reason
I'll stop carrying this phone

146
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,447
The total is 29,000 won

147
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,650
Isn't it too warm to
wear a mitten?

148
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,450
Don't you have
any bag with straps?

149
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,359
Hey, trouble-making girl!

150
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,469
You look like an
exemplary student, though

151
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,572
Sneaking a smoke without your
mother knowing?

152
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,771
Give me my lighter back

153
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,371
Why, so you can smoke
secretly some more?

154
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,473
Why are you picking on me?

155
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,550
That's what guys do when they
find a girl they like

156
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,846
You know what, I studied
psychology a little

157
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:07,254
Human beings have a tendency
to solve problems unconsciously

158
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,556
So if someone makes you feel bad

159
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,358
you keep thinking about him

160
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,567
Like how school boys pull on

161
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,967
the skirts of girls they like

162
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,069
Those little kids
know that instinctively

163
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,766
It's all in psychology books

164
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,078
Wasn't that on TV?
I saw that program, too

165
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,240
Huh? It was on TV, too?

166
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:38,254
Oh, I forgot your
lighter again

167
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,450
Take this, instead of the cigarette
that I borrowed yesterday

168
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,262
No I want my lighter back

169
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:49,857
Hey, don't be such a grouch
This isn't just a candy, it's my heart

170
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,854
Hello my princess
Did you have fun today?

171
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,650
Icky... Am I a baby?

172
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:18,661
Of course, spilling things all over
Didn't you forget something?

173
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,156
Someone found it
and gave it to the janitor

174
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,163
Keep it safe
It's expensive

175
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,764
Save my number and my restaurant
number in your phone

176
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,374
You can save up to
1,000 numbers on it

177
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,539
I don't even know 10 numbers

178
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,651
Aren't you going to answer it?

179
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,566
- Hello
- Hi, trouble-maker!

180
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,363
Wrong number

181
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,677
Hey, don't hang up!
I'm really sorry about today

182
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,781
Give me a chance to apologize

183
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,850
What number did you dial?

184
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,849
Oh, is your mother there?

185
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,250
- You got the wrong number
- Wait, hold on!

186
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,654
Open the window in an hour
It's important, please!

187
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:30,164
Wow, this phone is so cool
I can take pictures, too

188
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,169
Mina... don't you want to
fall in love?

189
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,274
Misuk, wake up

190
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,468
Okay, here is a picture of
a crazy woman

191
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,476
When I was your age, that's
what I always thought about

192
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:46,641
Where I could find a hot boy?
Where I could find my love?

193
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,949
So was it successful?

194
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,250
Of course, My romantic life
was really prospering back then

195
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,759
My dating life was always
packed and croweded

196
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,157
It was awesome

197
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,356
That's your problem, Misuk

198
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,467
confusing love and business

199
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,866
And you want to get
as much as you give

200
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,767
Real love isn't like that

201
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,569
It's just being happy without
getting anything... only giving

202
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,770
You must have read too many
romance comic books

203
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,349
In my opinion
Love is like this...

204
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:22,249
Someone you love gets hit by a
car and killed one rainy day

205
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,651
After that, you can't leave
the accident site

206
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,157
You go there to direct traffic
thinking about your love

207
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,558
Never missing a single day
Crying when it's raining...

208
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,860
What an ominous
comic book you read

209
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,764
Anyway, I will definitely find
the man of my destiny

210
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,269
and fall madly in love
with him

211
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,374
When I finally introduce him to
you, please be opposed to him

212
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,068
- even if you like him
- Why?

213
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,974
Because it would be cool

214
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,645
I will have an immortal love
that overcomes all obstacles

215
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,344
A love that can't be defeated

216
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,048
by parents, nations
or even death

217
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,555
How about you? Have you had
a passionate love?

218
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,062
Sure

219
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,362
- My dad?
- Yes

220
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,369
Do you still love him?

221
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,565
I don't know
I forgot everything

222
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,350
- Lies!
- It's true

223
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:32,549
- You still think about me, don't you?
- Once in a while

224
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:38,561
- What kind of thoughts?
- Thoughts of how much I owe you

225
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:42,463
Do you think Mina is a debt?

226
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:47,971
Mina is a present
The biggest present you gave to me

227
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,872
Then what do you think
you owed me?

228
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,570
Happiness

229
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:03,551
I owe you my happiness
And I owe Mina

230
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,954
There's no way
I can repay you

231
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:12,155
but I can reward Mina, so I'll do
as much as I can for her

232
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:16,961
So you must help me

233
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:23,371
Help our Mina only to
have happy times

234
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,271
until she goes to you

235
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:50,764
Hurry and open your window
or you'll regret it!

236
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,345
Tonight, I'll wait for you
Same time, same place

237
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:23,350
Hey, hey there!
Room No 306!

238
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,760
Hey! Hey you
What are you doing there?

239
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,161
Oh, well there...

240
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:44,173
There's a mouse
on the window ledge

241
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,677
A mouse at night...

242
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,739
What a strange boy...

243
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,660
You know

244
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,174
You knew my hand was like this
before you gave birth, right?

245
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,678
I read that people
get abortions

246
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,543
for much smaller problems

247
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,145
Why didn't you do that?

248
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,266
Mina, you're all
grown up now, right?

249
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:56,174
There is one secret that
I never told anyone

250
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,749
I didn't want to tell you in a
place like this, in this way

251
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,747
What is it? Tell me

252
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,757
The truth is, your father...

253
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,765
isn't your real father

254
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,369
You just resembled so much
your father's hand

255
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,565
Your father was an alien

256
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,554
- Get out!
- You really believed me, right?

257
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,056
- No way! I didn't
- You were definitely taken in

258
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,355
You totally believed me
for about 30 seconds

259
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,861
Knock it off!

260
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,570
Maybe for 3 seconds

261
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:27,170
Someone left this at the door
Isn't it yours, Mina?

262
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,670
Oh, my!

263
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,144
This turtle cannot live
without its mate

264
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,152
And I've taken the
other one hostage

265
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,348
If you don't want
the turtles to die

266
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,459
surrender now

267
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,263
Aw... it's so sweet

268
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,752
Come on in

269
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,159
Why are you standing there?

270
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,356
You think I set a trap?

271
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,977
What kind of house is this?

272
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,978
This apartment was
just a studio originally

273
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,751
The owner let me rent it cheap
providing he could leave his stuff here

274
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,549
Say, why are you empty-handed?
Where's my turtle?

275
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,658
Wasn't it a present for me?

276
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,455
A present? That was just bait

277
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,264
Then I spit the bait out

278
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,956
so give me my lighter back

279
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,967
What a heartless neighbor

280
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,264
Okay, wait a second

281
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,066
Where did I put that lighter?

282
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,351
I can't find it right now
Use this one instead

283
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,993
Call, when you are lonely

284
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,959
Oh, hey, that's not mine

285
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:44,270
This must be my friend's
What a clumsy guy he is...

286
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,468
Here it is
Heran Erotic Massage...

287
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,549
Wait a sec!
Where did I...

288
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,655
I don't care
Just give me mine

289
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:02,453
I'm sure I put it
somewhere safe

290
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,861
It's really important to me
Find it right now

291
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:10,559
Don't worry I'll find it

292
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,661
I don't believe what you
say mister, just find it

293
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:19,266
Mister? I'm just a few years
older than you

294
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,573
Call me "big brother"
Say it, "bro-ther..."

295
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,649
Hmm, you don't seem to trust me at all

296
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:28,945
Wait...

297
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,254
Here!

298
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:40,358
Take this as a hostage, to go
with the one in your house

299
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:44,662
I wanted to use them as bait
but now they are real hostages

300
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:49,466
Wait a little, I will come
to save you soon

301
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,666
Don't make any trouble

302
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,178
Oh well, at least she won't
eat you or anything

303
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,841
By the way, what was your
phone number again?

304
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,145
I memorized it from your phone
the other day

305
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,447
but I forgot it

306
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,146
What for?

307
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,258
You don't want to get
your lighter back?

308
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,257
- 011-9262-8979
- Hold on! Wait!

309
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,161
What was it?

310
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,359
011-9262-8979

311
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:22,371
011-9262-8979
011-9262-8979

312
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,869
What on earth are you doing now?

313
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,841
It's okay Don't you watch TV at all?

314
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,544
Like the TV ad, you can remove
stains like this easily

315
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,747
Huh? Isn't this supposed to work?

316
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,975
Erased! I think it's working now!

317
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,977
It should be... What do you think
we're doing this for?

318
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:11,446
Oh crud! Crud!

319
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,251
Why the hell did you do this?

320
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,950
He's crazy

321
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,160
I saw them just wipe it off on TV

322
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,061
This must be a different
kind of floor

323
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,668
Sure, you silly!

324
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:28,169
Only new floors have that feature

325
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,371
It's not him being crazy
He's just dumb

326
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,377
How stupid!
Wait a minute...

327
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,142
Isn't this Mina's
phone number?

328
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,148
Why did you write this?

329
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,445
What?

330
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,056
Right!

331
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,454
How come Mina's
number is here?

332
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,458
What the...

333
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,063
Oh, that's...
I take photographs

334
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,757
She's so pretty
I was going

335
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,562
to ask her to be my model

336
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,161
- Oh, It's nothing...
- Hey, hey

337
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,173
Well, isn't that a typical way
to seduce a girl?

338
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,573
- No! It really isn't
- That's right

339
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,739
He's trying to seduce me
The photo thing is just an excuse

340
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,147
I knew it
It's so obvious

341
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:18,153
Once you start taking photos
he'll ask you to take it... uh...

342
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,757
That... what do you call it,

343
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,157
a "noodle" model?

344
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:28,356
You know... A model
taking photos naked?

345
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,158
A nude model?

346
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,361
Yes, a nude model

347
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:37,167
Well, on the other hand...

348
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,072
having a picture of you all young
and pretty wouldn't be that bad

349
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,771
Really? Then I should do it?

350
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:54,356
Um, nice model...
nice expression...

351
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,454
Give it to me

352
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,877
- No?
- I don't smoke in the daytime

353
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,747
What a cowardly, delinquent girl...

354
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,445
Give it to me

355
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,654
I'll show you

356
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,250
Let me show you
the easiest way

357
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,656
Set this on P
Then it's automatic

358
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,660
Hold it on an angle, like this

359
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,357
And then press this button
to get a focus

360
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,461
And after the "click" sound

361
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,473
just press the shutter
Try it

362
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,350
Why are you taking my lighter
when you've got so many already?

363
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,547
Didn't you smoke yesterday?

364
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,451
That's not your business

365
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,854
Did or didn't you think of me
when you were smoking?

366
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,960
You did!

367
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,065
You've started thinking
about me every time you smoke

368
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,362
It's because I have your lighter

369
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,768
What do you think of my
tension-creates-attraction theory?

370
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:20,071
No wonder you've got so many
lighters in your house

371
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,442
Okay, you deserve to meet me
I agree!

372
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,946
Who deserves whom?

373
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,447
You and me

374
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,752
How dare an old guy like you say
such a thing to a young girl?

375
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,947
I'm only a little older than you

376
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,253
Besides, I treat people 10 years
older or younger like my age

377
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,955
Than I should treat you
like my age too?

378
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,563
I think I had crush on you
from the first time I saw you

379
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,841
I'm going home now

380
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,364
I heard that the downstairs boy
came by today?

381
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,559
Boy?

382
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:57,163
How would I call him then?
Downstairs fellow? Downstairs dude?

383
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,672
I like That

384
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,440
I heard he gave you turtles?
What's the name?

385
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,140
Neil and Armstrong

386
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,251
What?

387
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,951
I mean the downstairs dude

388
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,557
Lee Young-jae

389
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,561
- What does he do?
- Takes photographs

390
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,860
What a handsome guy
doing such a cool thing

391
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,968
Which means he's just
fooling around

392
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:30,972
Well, he seems like a nice guy
You know I have an eye for men

393
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,672
I can introduce you if you want

394
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,248
Never mind
You keep him!

395
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,850
I'd rather buy an egg and wait
for it to become a chicken to eat

396
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,648
than wait for that dude to grow up

397
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,572
Kang Mina!

398
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,553
It's going to rain today

399
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,249
Hi my Mina!

400
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,046
What's up with you
visiting me here?

401
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,849
To maintain my popularity

402
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,154
Then why didn't you come to
the hospital to see me?

403
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,957
Did you have to
bring me out here?

404
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:04,465
You don't even want to
set one foot in the hospital?

405
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,765
I even wish I could rip off your
nurse's uniform

406
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:11,370
No, not today

407
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,170
I'm wearing a cheap bra today

408
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,047
It's raining

409
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,192
I don't have an umbrella

410
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,853
I have one I'll walk with you
to the hospital

411
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,052
Okay

412
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,001
Hey, you still don't
have a boyfriend?

413
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:45,907
Except for eating meat
I'm practically a monk, you know

414
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,302
Then you've never had a boyfriend?

415
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:53,676
Well, can I call them boyfriends?

416
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,181
Why do you ask
by the way?

417
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,885
Have you got a boyfriend?

418
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,493
Huh?

419
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,496
No, I was just...

420
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,597
You really don't
need to feel insecure

421
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,898
Don't worry and do
what you want to do

422
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,806
There are no right answers
Follow your feelings...

423
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,471
- That's the right answer
- Okay

424
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,484
Okay

425
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,781
I'm sorry but some customers just

426
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,584
showed up without reservations
Let's go some other time

427
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:35,783
How about this flower? sir

428
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,985
- Over there!
- Okay

429
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:41,393
Gosh, I am late I've got to go
Talk to you later Bye!

430
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,406
Hello?

431
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,810
- What are you doing now?
- Going home

432
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,675
What will you do at home?

433
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,479
I've got lots of time, Is there
anything you want to do with me?

434
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,685
I want sacks

435
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,098
What? Sex! Hello? Hello?

436
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,790
Mina?

437
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,502
Well... that is...

438
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,401
After we've been
dating for a while

439
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:30,276
After we're really close...

440
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:34,180
I mean, when two people
really want each other

441
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,379
This is so embarrassing
but I should be considerate

442
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,587
Oh god... Uh, but if you want to
do it, I'm sure I'd be good...

443
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,189
Tramp

444
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,094
No, I'm not
It really sounded like that

445
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,701
And who call them
sacks these days?

446
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,479
The way you talk to me has been
disrespectful recently

447
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,677
Didn't you say you treat most people
like they're your age? Oh! My bus!

448
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:25,798
Oh my! What's this?
What am I going to do?

449
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,494
I'm so sorry

450
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,602
I'm sorry

451
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:39,476
It's okay
Can't help it...

452
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,477
I apologize

453
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:00,699
Take off your glove

454
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,705
- It's okay
- It's all sticky

455
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,281
Is it ticklish?

456
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,588
It may look strange
but it works fine

457
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:35,193
Blast all the humans with your death ray!

458
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,385
Hey, don't step on my head!

459
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:58,889
- What are you doing under my legs?
- Enjoying the view

460
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,494
Hey, are you hungry now?

461
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,597
Here's a donut for you!

462
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,579
Can't you do it better?
It can't make up here

463
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:42,895
Hey! What are you
doing up there?

464
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,877
Hey Mina!
You really disappeared quickly

465
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,483
Why did you leave me alone?

466
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,085
The guard saw your
empty window

467
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,881
and treated me like a thief

468
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,579
You should thank me for

469
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,987
not shouting "Stop thief!"

470
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,594
Hello, ma'am How are you?

471
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,292
This is for you

472
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,495
Oh, I am sorry to
trouble you so often

473
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,400
You must be very tired?

474
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,007
Yes, I'm a little worried about

475
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,600
the young man downstairs

476
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,770
Single guys living along can be

477
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,779
crazy with girls and drinking...

478
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,476
It gets on my nerves

479
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,086
- I don't...
- Take care!

480
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,486
Oh, you leaving?
Take care!

481
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,188
You shouldn't
look down on them

482
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,299
I couldn't help you even if
they ran away

483
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,697
Don't you think they feel all
cooped up in a goldfish bowl?

484
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,100
They should get some
fresh air sometimes

485
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,004
Am I that pretty?

486
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:59,081
Well you have a disease too
A princess disease

487
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,483
Wow It's been a long time
since I saw this

488
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,781
What is it?

489
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,483
You don't know this?
It's the right-left-net game

490
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,887
By the way, Misuk and I
are going to Europe

491
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,588
Only two young girls together?

492
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,702
Oh, Misuk is my mother

493
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,395
You're so sassy

494
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,098
How can you call your
mother by her name?

495
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,007
Is she your stepmother?
I never heard this story

496
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,680
What are you some kind
of private investigator?

497
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:37,185
Oh no, You know how
the maid talks sometimes

498
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,689
Since I was sick and
in the hospital

499
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,795
instead of going to school

500
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:48,295
What's that got to do with
using your mom's name?

501
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:51,094
So I had no friends

502
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:52,795
The kids in my ward

503
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,996
were scared of my hand

504
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,504
By the time we got used
to each other

505
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,611
and became friends...

506
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:05,181
they'd have gotten well and
left hospital or they died

507
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,475
How about you?

508
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:10,178
I was in and out of the hospital

509
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,881
Once, after a big operation
I was in a coma for months

510
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,486
Even if I woke up

511
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,188
I just caught
some other disease

512
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,491
Do you know what my nickname
was among nurses?

513
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,603
The 13th-floor fixture

514
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,096
How about now?
Are you okay now?

515
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,606
- Yes, clearly
- You, you're dead!

516
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,801
What?

517
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,476
You're dead if you
step on the crack

518
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,690
So?

519
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,694
I was always complaining about
having no friends

520
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,697
So one day
Misuk entered my room

521
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,495
wearing pigtails, holding a doll

522
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:08,101
And she said "Hi, my name is Misuk
Can we be friends?"

523
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:13,080
- What a nice mother
- I like her too

524
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,299
Good night

525
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,503
Why such a dutiful kiss?

526
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,405
Why are you complaining
when I'm so nice to you?

527
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,775
Wait a minute You look different

528
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,974
Not natural
Do you have a boyfriend?

529
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,085
You've been practicing your
kissing, haven't you?

530
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,983
What? Knock it off!
