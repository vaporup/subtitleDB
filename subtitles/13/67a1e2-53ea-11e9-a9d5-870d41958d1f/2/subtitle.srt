1
00:00:00,657 --> 00:00:05,924
Well, seeing you get angry
I think he must be real, Who is he?

2
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:08,121
I said there's nothing
to talk about

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:12,326
Anyway, good luck, Don't be too
difficult like you are with me

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:14,437
Be nice to him

5
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:17,639
I'm surprised
Hooking up with boys...

6
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,434
It's not like that!

7
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:25,505
Aquarius? Sorry, but you'll have
bad luck with boys all month

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:31,110
No way I've got
3 blind dates next week

9
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:33,620
Really? You know, I'm an expert
on juggling guys

10
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:35,224
Can't I go there
instead of you?

11
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:36,416
Why you?
I should go

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,222
Stop fighting What's yours?
Let's decide from the sign

13
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:40,920
I'm a Capricorn

14
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:43,032
You go! You've got
terrific luck with love

15
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,428
Of course!

16
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:48,834
- No way! It's the same sign...
- Hey...

17
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,236
Can I see the Zodiac too?

18
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:05,715
Lucky color - Orange
Lucky icon - Pink heart

19
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:24,737
Wow, your maid is
really a fantastic cook!

20
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:27,342
Did you take this picture yourself?

21
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:29,445
Yes, in Hawaii

22
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:36,317
I went there as an assistant
making a fashion catalogue

23
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:42,914
Hmm... not bad
It must be nice to travel

24
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,323
But Hawaii's a little stale

25
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:47,225
Hawaii is "stale"?

26
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,924
How about Europe, then?

27
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,534
I began to like Hawaii so much
after I visited there

28
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:54,728
So I studied about it, and now

29
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:57,135
I am an expert on Hawaii

30
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,332
I even studied
the Hawaiian language

31
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:01,137
Ohno means delicious

32
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,438
Thank you
is "mahalo"...

33
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:15,017
You always listen to
this song, don't you?

34
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:17,626
Yes, I like it

35
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:22,027
Don't you think the lyrics are
a bit too depressing?

36
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:24,827
Really? What do they mean?

37
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:27,627
Well, it's just...

38
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:33,732
Will Neil and Armstrong become
big like this turtle one day?

39
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:38,507
Hey, is this brain totally empty?
Hello! Anyone here?

40
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:41,617
This is a different species from them

41
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:43,218
Look here! Even where they live

42
00:02:43,353 --> 00:02:47,221
This one lives in the sea but...
Neil & Armstrong live in a fish bowl

43
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,723
You're so ignorant

44
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:54,528
Then is that why you look ugly?
Because you're so smart?

45
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:07,543
Now I know why I liked him
a lot from the beginning

46
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:18,216
Is your father an alien, too?

47
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,617
Before the main shooting

48
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:01,527
I need to get some
rough cuts first

49
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,828
I'd like to take some pictures here
before rehearsal starts

50
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:07,734
Shall we?

51
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:09,930
- Wait a minute please
- Yes

52
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,728
Would you like to try this on?

53
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:39,426
- Oh, No thanks
- It's okay

54
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,230
You can try it

55
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:24,742
- Shall we start now?
- Sure

56
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:38,023
Now, hold this bar, and try this

57
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,524
One

58
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:42,631
Two

59
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:44,733
Three

60
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,426
Four

61
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:48,332
Five

62
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,132
Six

63
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:52,138
Seven

64
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,936
Eight

65
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:55,635
One

66
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:57,541
Two

67
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,409
Three

68
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,210
Four

69
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,909
Five

70
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:04,519
Six

71
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:06,519
Seven

72
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:08,021
Eight

73
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:12,218
And move your foot like this

74
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,728
One

75
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:17,025
Two

76
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,225
Three

77
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:20,631
Four

78
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,135
Repeat

79
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:24,536
One

80
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:26,733
Two

81
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:29,140
Three

82
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,143
Four

83
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,418
Now, shall we try?

84
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,730
Why don't you take
off your glove? It's slippery

85
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:15,720
Oh, okay, yes, holding the bar

86
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,827
Like this... One

87
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:20,827
Two

88
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:22,932
Three

89
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,330
Four

90
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:27,527
Five

91
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,137
Six

92
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,013
Hey!

93
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:15,515
Miss! Are you okay?

94
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:17,209
Mina! Mina!
What happened?

95
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:18,217
I don't know
Suddenly...

96
00:08:18,354 --> 00:08:23,018
Mina! Are you okay? Mina!

97
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,525
Look at me!
Someone call 911!

98
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:28,027
Mina! Mina...

99
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,937
Are you okay now?

100
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,816
Where am I?
The hospital?

101
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:53,813
No, you're at home

102
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,322
Then why is she here?

103
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,622
How can you speak so cruelly?

104
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:02,925
I came to see if you're okay

105
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:07,136
Are you going to put me
in the hospital?

106
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,330
She says you don't need to
Don't worry

107
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:15,137
The hospital is all full anyway
You wouldn't get in even if you begged

108
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,907
This IV is to rehydrate and give you
vitamins, Now go to sleep!

109
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:24,714
Misuk, why don't you go and work?
Don't stay home because of me

110
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:26,822
Okay

111
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,321
You can go now too

112
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,824
I'll pull this out after it finishes

113
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,825
Yes, let's leave together

114
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:34,725
I'll give you a ride

115
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:14,527
Yun-jung!

116
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:22,040
You think I'm wrong
for discharging Mina

117
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:24,942
from hospital like that?

118
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,814
No

119
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,010
The reason I let Mina stay
at home is because

120
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:34,623
I want to live with her

121
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:38,421
even if it was
forjust one more day

122
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:42,621
Mina...

123
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:47,133
When she was hospitalized
again last year

124
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,738
she cut her wrists

125
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:56,738
When I got back to her room
after admitting her

126
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:01,917
her sheets were all red

127
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,427
So...

128
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:19,126
Don't blame me for not
doing anything for her

129
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:21,917
Ah, nice

130
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:25,323
You see?
Isn't it cool and fresh?

131
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:28,021
- Aren't you cold?
- I'm okay

132
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,722
I feel much better now

133
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:33,426
I was itching to go out
after staying inside all day

134
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:36,834
It seems that you enjoy going
out a lot these days?

135
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:39,338
Hey, why don't you stand up
and push me?

136
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,534
I'm a patient

137
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:44,646
Right, you stay there
and I'll push you

138
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,806
Weren't you thinking I'd say that?
Stop nagging and push me

139
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,016
- Is this why you gave birth to me?
- Yes

140
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:58,319
How did you feel wearing
toe shoes today?

141
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,429
It was okay

142
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:03,726
I think ballet isn't as elegant
as I thought before

143
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,629
It's very hard work

144
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:08,430
That's why I didn't want
you to do ballet

145
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:12,940
They say 30% of ballerinas
are in chronic pain

146
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,235
Okay

147
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:16,140
So don't work too hard

148
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,907
And don't skip any of your medicine
And if you're feeling a little anemic

149
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,916
Boring, stop it

150
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,917
Okay, I'll stop

151
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:26,715
But please keep pushing me

152
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,016
No

153
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:30,819
If you push me, I will take you
to Europe next month

154
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,325
Next month?

155
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:37,626
- What about school?
- You can skip it

156
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,531
That doesn't sound like
what a mother would say

157
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:46,433
How about going to Hawaii
instead of Europe?

158
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:50,341
Why? Didn't you want to go to
a ballet performance in Europe?

159
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:53,004
There's something I want to see
more in Hawaii

160
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:58,610
Really? Then we could go to Hawaii
It'd be cheaper anyway

161
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:03,123
You know, I've been thinking
about it and...

162
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,524
I guess we don't want to go
as part of a tour group

163
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:09,927
Of course not
That's not our style

164
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:14,434
But it's dangerous for 2 pretty
young women to go by themselves

165
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,233
Especially as my beauty is so
well-known internationally

166
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:19,636
That's right

167
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:23,541
And if it's just us, we can't take
pictures of us together

168
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,904
Oh, you're right

169
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,608
Then maybe we should
take someone with us?

170
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:34,921
As a carrier and bodyguard
As a photographer and tour guide

171
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,125
Can you come with us?

172
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:41,422
- It would be an honor
- Not you

173
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,122
My pleasure

174
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:58,240
- It's done, now
- Thank you

175
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,612
You see? I knew
it would be great

176
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:03,013
That's because my face is pretty

177
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,814
- Now, your turn
- Oh, I'm...

178
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:09,413
Why don't you have
a seat anyway?

179
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,120
Please make it really pretty

180
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,628
lam a real genius to think of this

181
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:23,727
Such a great idea

182
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:26,332
It's the first time for you
to have a manicure, right?

183
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:29,535
Pedicure, It's for the toes

184
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:34,308
Give me a break

185
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,908
Whatever it is, this is the
first time for me too

186
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:44,223
Oh, my lighter!

187
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:46,928
I finally got it!

188
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:51,631
Hey, let me use it again
to light a cigarette

189
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:55,931
No way
Here, I'll light it myself

190
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:07,516
Where did you get that?

191
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,515
It's my father's

192
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:14,521
He didn't give it to me actually
Misuk was hiding it and I found it

193
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,215
Was he in the navy?

194
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,121
Yes

195
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,125
What kind of man was he?

196
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:23,723
We never talk about him

197
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:26,733
Misuk and I... felt that
we would get too sad

198
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:34,334
Hey I think I will feel awkward
whenever I go to pee

199
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:36,940
Why?

200
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,013
Because you'll always see me

201
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,107
Ah!

202
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,213
Cold! Too cold!

203
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:42,334
You'll end up an alcoholic
if you keep drinking like this

204
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:45,208
I am Okay, okay

205
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:47,315
You seem worried

206
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:48,711
No

207
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:53,420
Why would I be worried when
I have such a pretty daughter?

208
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:58,022
My Mina... Will you live well
without me?

209
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,128
Why? Do you want to
marry again?

210
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:02,025
Will you?

211
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:06,227
Worry about yourself
I'll be fine

212
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:10,530
Yes, you'll be fine without me

213
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:18,606
Well... do you like the
downstairs dude?

214
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:22,205
I don't know! What kind of
silly question is that?

215
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:25,912
Tell me I'll help you

216
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:27,818
It's not like that

217
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:30,220
Then what is it?

218
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:37,527
It's just... He's fun to be with
and he's nice to me

219
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,634
How nice I should thank him

220
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:47,731
Mina... have a great time in Hawaii

221
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:30,643
There's no way I can repay you

222
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:37,309
but I can reward Mina, so I'll do
as much as I can for her

223
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:42,014
So you must help me

224
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:45,820
Help our Mina to
only have happy times

225
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:49,021
until she goes to you

226
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:51,632
Help me...

227
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:03,642
Kang Mina!

228
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,110
Mina!

229
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:08,912
Mina!

230
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,122
Hey, Mina!

231
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:18,126
Mina!

232
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:48,116
You... your eyes are puffy?

233
00:22:48,257 --> 00:22:50,919
- I drank some beer last night
- Alone?

234
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,721
You drank alone, too

235
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,739
Wow What a nice surprise

236
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:09,241
Oh, right, it'll rain today
Hold on, I'll get an umbrella

237
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:21,415
Mina, your umbrella!

238
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,909
Hey, excuse me

239
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:51,917
- That girl?
- Yes

240
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,810
Something happened in the class?

241
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,435
That poor guy is pathetic

242
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:29,915
Losing his love
being left alone

243
00:25:32,054 --> 00:25:36,320
Being crazy because of love

244
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:53,130
He seems like a happy person
Not everyone can have that kind of love

245
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:57,143
And he'll live with his love
forever in his heart

246
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:12,115
Mom!

247
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:13,915
Yes?

248
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:36,640
If I lie here like this
I can only see the sky

249
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:39,611
I feel like I'm on an airplane

250
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:42,410
You've never taken a plane

251
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:46,621
Do you think I can?

252
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:49,423
We will go to Hawaii soon

253
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:53,025
Right

254
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,906
Isn't there a regular customer

255
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,814
in this restaurant who likes you?

256
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:22,322
Didn't you know? All the guys who
come here, come to see me

257
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:25,319
I mean it, someone who's serious

258
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:28,420
Someone who's nice
who you could marry

259
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:30,531
Now, with a little make up
you look nice

260
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,929
But what will you do
after you get old?

261
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:35,935
Children are no use
when you get old

262
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:42,642
What? now you have a boyfriend
You don't need mom anymore?

263
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:44,244
It's just...

264
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,012
I think you'll be lonely

265
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:50,014
after I get married and leave...

266
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:53,211
Don't worry

267
00:28:57,158 --> 00:28:58,716
I worry

268
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:04,224
If you insist

269
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:08,234
I'll find a nice man soon
a rich and kind guy

270
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,838
Are you sure you'll
call him dad?

271
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:13,736
No way! I even call you
Misuk, not "mom"

272
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:17,834
I'll just call his name
Hey, Bubba! Like that

273
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:19,708
No! Never!

274
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:23,215
You will call him, Leonardo!

275
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:25,114
What!

276
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:38,526
Nice, the smell of dawn

277
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,143
Are you sleepy?

278
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:54,214
Of course
I just fell asleep

279
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,017
- What?
- This...

280
00:29:57,152 --> 00:30:01,020
This is a present for a good kid
who got up early

281
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:02,316
And...

282
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:05,519
Take these too

283
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,623
Why? Don't you like them?

284
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:12,733
I don't need hostages anymore

285
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:14,926
Now, I trust you

286
00:30:20,975 --> 00:30:23,136
Let's take a picture together

287
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:26,613
- Now?
- Yes!

288
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:29,808
Because I'm very happy now

289
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,316
Right this moment

290
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:36,220
I want a witness who'll testify
that I was happy

291
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:40,818
You, Neil, and Armstrong
all in a picture together

292
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:44,523
But looking like this?

293
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,726
Now is the best you've looked
since I've known you

294
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,342
Hurry! Hurry!

295
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:50,729
Mina! What are you looking for?

296
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:52,332
A sea turtle

297
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,731
Where is it anyway?

298
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:57,235
Why? You'll go to Hawaii
to see one soon, anyway?

299
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:00,034
Didn't you say it would be hard
to find one, even in Hawaii?

300
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:04,737
Of course, not all people can find
a sea turtle, but I will help you find one

301
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:09,111
No matter how difficult
So don't worry

302
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:21,821
The sea turtles aren't on display
They're having their regular checkups

303
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:23,828
Why so disappointed?

304
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:26,229
I'll show you a real one soon

305
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,631
One not locked up in a tiny Aquarium

306
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,931
but one in the real Pacific...

307
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:33,438
Let's get something nice to eat

308
00:32:56,764 --> 00:32:59,028
Mina! Mina!

309
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,435
Mina! Mina!

310
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:02,421
That poor guy is pathetic

311
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:08,427
Losing his love
being left alone

312
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:14,736
Being crazy because of love

313
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:20,607
Now, I trust you!

314
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:19,524
I want you to take this back

315
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:35,713
I should've noticed something
was wrong from the beginning

316
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,308
I thought it was a lot of money
just to spend time with your

317
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:41,319
daughter and take pictures of her

318
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,619
If I take this money, it means

319
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:50,628
I met Mina because of money

320
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,929
I can't do that

321
00:36:57,772 --> 00:37:00,240
If I do that
I could never see her again

322
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:06,112
Sorry

323
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:09,908
I am sorry really sorry, Young-jae

324
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:38,309
Unlike what most people think
Hawaii has distinct seasons

325
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:42,111
These distinctions are
clear to Hawaiians

326
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,414
It is summer when the ripe
mangoes begin to fall

327
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:51,218
and when you smell
ginger flower in the wind

328
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,318
The signs of winter are the rains

329
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:58,023
and huge waves
that surfers love

330
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:00,529
The people who live in cool places

331
00:38:00,668 --> 00:38:04,126
such as Kauai and Maui Islands...

332
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:08,641
gather by the fire
around Christmastime

333
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:12,405
Hawaii has a warm climate all year

334
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:17,109
Rainy from October to March
Dry from April to September

335
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:21,711
However, the weather changes
only slightly between seasons

336
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:27,226
so you can enjoy sunny skies
most of the year

337
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:31,627
You can often find sea turtles

338
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:33,734
along the coast

339
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,429
And the turtles are waiting

340
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:41,940
for Mina to come

341
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:45,302
to see them

342
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:54,109
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll stay here

343
00:39:55,149 --> 00:39:56,616
Let's go, Misuk

344
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,539
What are we going to
talk about today?

345
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:33,308
Oh, yes

346
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:37,110
We'll go to the west beach
and see the "green flash" sunset

347
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:43,021
You can only see it on totally
clear day

348
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:45,819
at the last moment when the sun
sinks beneath the horizon

349
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:50,422
Some say it will give you love

350
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:53,226
Some say it grants wishes

351
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:42,935
What is this?

352
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,937
- Is that a real human hand?
- It's creepy

353
00:44:46,073 --> 00:44:48,541
Yeah, it's creepy
Let's go!

354
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:06,423
We've graduated

355
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:09,623
All the good seasons are gone

356
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:11,731
Now, what am I going
to do for living?

357
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:14,834
Whatever you do
just take care of yourself

358
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:16,732
Broken arms and broken legs...

359
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,030
So pathetic!

360
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:20,640
Should we commit some kind of
wild scam together?

361
00:45:20,774 --> 00:45:23,140
- What?
- To make some money

362
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:53,537
I am so sorry

363
00:45:53,674 --> 00:45:56,541
I know that I did
a terrible thing to you

364
00:45:57,378 --> 00:46:00,211
Please understand it as a
selfish mother's love

365
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,406
and forgive me

366
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:09,012
And one more...

367
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:16,529
This...

368
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:31,433
To my dear Youngjae who shared
the happiest time of my life

369
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,836
To my dearest Mom...

370
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:46,410
I know it must've been hard for you
to do this for me, thank you

371
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:49,920
I don't know how many
more days I have

372
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:52,525
but I'll be happy

373
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:58,529
I want to give this to you
as a present, before I leave

374
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:03,534
And I am really happy now
