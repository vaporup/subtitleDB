1
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,296
Make sure to drop in.

2
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:24,804
Here's a discount ticket
with lots of cute girls.

3
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:28,677
We're all college girls.

4
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,110
A perfect place for
your taste...

5
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,475
You're not students!

6
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:37,577
If you are, go home and study.

7
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:42,185
Good evening!

8
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:50,560
Sorry.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,168
Oh, that's right!
You work here.

10
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:02,312
Don't bother.
You'll get dirty hands.

11
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:07,716
Kajikawa, what are you doing?

12
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:08,407
Sorry.

13
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:09,551
Hurry up!

14
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,383
Broken.

15
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,079
It's all right. Don't worry.

16
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,434
hello, it's me.

17
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:36,274
I had a club meeting.
I'll be late. Sorry.

18
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,253
I'm home.

19
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,655
Hi! I'll fix supper.

20
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:53,986
Take a bath with me.

21
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,530
Ah, hey! Stop it!

22
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,801
Heisuke...

23
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:09,676
Heisuke.

24
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,989
It's hot. Be careful.

25
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,656
How about some dessert?

26
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:24,994
I've got to study.

27
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,641
Hello. This is Sugita.

28
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:49,452
Sorry to call so late.

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,944
My name is Soma.

30
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,685
Can I talk to Monami?

31
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,883
Which Soma are you?

32
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,186
From the sailboat club.

33
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,158
Hold on.

34
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,065
Naoko, telephone.

35
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:08,734
All right.

36
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,370
Hello.

37
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,509
It's me. Soma.

38
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,840
Oh, Mr. Soma, good evening.

39
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,514
Can we talk?

40
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,478
Yes, it's all right.

41
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:25,587
Second place Chunichi
will play hiroshima...

42
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:30,352
The Yokohama - Yakult
game was exciting...

43
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,029
A runner was on first base...

44
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,169
You're pulling my leg.

45
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,714
No. I mean it.
You have natural aptitude.

46
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,408
But a race? No way.

47
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:57,776
I guarantee you can do it.

48
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,654
Sorry, I've got to go.

49
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,284
Okay, catch you later.
Good night.

50
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,225
Good night.

51
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,059
Ouch!

52
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:17,965
What are you doing?
Eavesdropping?

53
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,474
So what? Is it wrong?

54
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,277
I'm your husband.

55
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:34,087
Don't you trust me?

56
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,795
This Soma, what is he?

57
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,325
My senior. We talked
about the sailboat club.

58
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,467
For 30 minutes?

59
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:50,500
He must have something
else in mind.

60
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:52,508
Mr. Soma isn't that
sort of man.

61
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:57,846
Mr. Soma? You call a kid
half your age, Mr. Soma?

62
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,676
Heisuke, why are you
so uptight?

63
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:05,911
Young men are like beasts.
Just waiting for a chance.

64
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:09,888
Don't worry.
He's just a kid. Trust me.

65
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:14,021
Don't be so conceited.

66
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,391
What's that mean?

67
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:26,900
You're my old lady...

68
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,337
And don't forget it.

69
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:55,769
Sugita.

70
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,299
Yes?

71
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,101
Let's go for a run
next Saturday.

72
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,742
Can't do it.

73
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,983
Why not? You got
something to do?

74
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,751
I need time to study.

75
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:15,349
I see.

76
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,413
"Soma, haruki"

77
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:52,879
Look, Sugita.
On Saturday, you really can't?

78
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:55,889
Sorry.

79
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:58,853
Okay.

80
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,224
See you.

81
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:06,265
Yeah, thank you.

82
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,544
I'm home.

83
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:24,919
Sorry to be late.
I'll make supper.

84
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:29,990
You're late. The sailboat club
drive you home? Pretty ritzy.

85
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,395
I didn't want to take a taxi.

86
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,456
More.

87
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,737
Some more.

88
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:06,821
Naoko.

89
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,457
Naoko!

90
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,774
I want to concentrate
on studying.

91
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,647
Sugita. You know
how I feel about you...

92
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:43,951
Give me your cell-phone number.

93
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:46,856
I don't have a cell-phone.

94
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:50,864
You don't like me?

95
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,498
It's not that...

96
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,339
I'll pick you up
at noon tomorrow.

97
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,502
No. Not at my house.

98
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:06,842
Then, the usual place,
Cafe da Vinci.

99
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,041
Ah, but...

100
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,380
I'll wait there
until you show up.

101
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,314
Ah, hello! Hello!

102
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:35,942
Naoko.

103
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,812
How about going
out for lunch today.

104
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,154
Got other plans?

105
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,122
No...

106
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,733
Hello, Kuniko?
How're you doing?

107
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,804
Fine. It's been a while.

108
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,005
I'm fine, too.

109
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,110
So, your dad is strict.

110
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:44,903
Yeah, will you cover for me?

111
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:46,308
Okay, I'll do it.

112
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,341
You saved my life.

113
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:53,053
Just call me on the phone,
10 minutes from now.

114
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:53,779
Okay!

115
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:54,479
Right.

116
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:55,954
So, bye for now.

117
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:56,853
Thank you.

118
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,474
Heisuke, telephone.

119
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,693
Hello. Sugita here.

120
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,501
I've got to meet Kuniko.

121
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,872
I'll be back by evening.

122
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,466
See you later.

123
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,282
Sugita!

124
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,339
Heisuke... Why...?

125
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,810
So, you are Soma?

126
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:31,910
Yes.

127
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:39,427
I'm Monami's father, and
she can't see you any more.

128
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,286
Why do you say that?

129
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:49,534
We live in a different
world from you.

130
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,273
I don't get it.
What do you mean?

131
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:05,246
We're from outer space.

132
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:16,122
We came from outer space.

133
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,699
We came from outer space.

134
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,507
Aren't you ashamed?

135
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,810
Naoko.

136
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:10,712
Why did you go there today?

137
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,319
I wanted to tell him to
leave me alone.

138
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:25,497
Oh, no! You could ignore him
but you wanted to see him.

139
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,935
See. I'm right.

140
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,638
Don't I have any privacy?

141
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,010
No right to enjoy myself?

142
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,388
No! You don't!

143
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:54,321
I have never played around!

144
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,359
And I turn down every
marriage offer.

145
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:00,596
How noble.

146
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:10,736
Miss Hashimoto attracted me,
but I gave up because of you.

147
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:17,842
I think Miss Kameda at the office
loves me, and she's very nice.

148
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:22,552
But there's nothing between
us because you are here.

149
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,391
There's no bright future
or fun for me.

150
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,704
But I'm here.

151
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,073
I'm not good enough?

152
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:52,448
Are you happy with me?

153
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,151
What's that mean?

154
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:05,059
Are you? I've got to know.
Stop tormenting me like this.

155
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,396
Am I tormenting you?

156
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:16,434
Have I lost my
Naoko forever?

157
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:21,416
I have no choice
but to live as Monami.

158
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:24,446
Monami was a good child.

159
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,385
She wasn't a liar or
a cheat like you.

160
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:30,081
That's true...

161
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,818
I should have died properly.

162
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,357
Thank you.

163
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,057
What'll it be.

164
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,962
I'll leave it up to you.

165
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:33,848
Hi, there.

166
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:35,155
I'm home.

167
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,151
I'll make supper.

168
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,790
Sorry. I already ate.

169
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:43,528
Say...

170
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:49,671
That... How about it?

171
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,904
I think you realize...

172
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,531
That this is my first...
So, be gentle.

173
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:34,410
What?

174
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,984
Contraceptive?
Do we need it?

175
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,919
I think it's safe today.

176
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,753
Are you sure we are
doing the right thing?

177
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,925
Should I hide my face?

178
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:28,286
I think...
We shouldn't do this.

179
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:32,724
Ah! Sorry.

180
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,392
Can I have a beer?

181
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:37,795
A bottle?

182
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:41,363
Cleaning up alone?

183
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,732
I'm the sub-manager.

184
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:02,285
I'll be the manager of a
new shop soon.

185
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:06,854
You're working hard.
Your father would be happy.

186
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,962
He wasn't my real father.

187
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:20,072
I'm the son of a guy my ma
knew before she met dad.

188
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,404
I didn't know till a while ago.

189
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:27,040
But it doesn't matter now.

190
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:33,249
If you don't mind.
Will you tell me about it?

191
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:44,924
My dad mistook me for his
kid and married my ma.

192
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,703
Stupid, isn't it?

193
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:56,143
When I was five,
ma told him about it.

194
00:24:56,945 --> 00:25:02,042
Dad left us and ma went wild.

195
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:11,423
I missed dad so much
I went to see him alone.

196
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:19,432
When he saw me, he called
ma and said he'd keep me.

197
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,440
I was living with dad
until the accident happened.

198
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:34,149
A little while ago,
ma told me...

199
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:39,651
Since her health failed
two years ago...

200
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:49,759
Dad had been sending her
money all the time.

201
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:58,766
I see... That's why he
overworked himself.

202
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:03,138
I thought he was spending
it on gambling.

203
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:10,518
When I found out the truth,
I decided to shape up.

204
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:19,590
I want to work hard to go
independent and live with ma.

205
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:22,787
And open a nice place for
families to dine.

206
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,673
Why did your father
keep you with him?

207
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,673
Well, I don't know.

208
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:47,649
Dad! Don't let go!

209
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,154
No, I won't! I won't!

210
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:51,951
There you go!

211
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,027
I did it! Yes, I can do it.

212
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,366
You did it, Fumiya!

213
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:00,498
My wife...

214
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:07,804
No... My daughter...

215
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:12,475
She heard the last words
of your father.

216
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,320
My family's happiness
is my happiness, he said.

217
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:27,026
He said that...?

218
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,694
Want some noodles?

219
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,071
Yes, but don't overcook them.

220
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:41,201
Right.

221
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:09,731
Naoko.

222
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:13,371
Naoko.

223
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,618
Naoko.

224
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,423
Hi, there.

225
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,720
I'll make you something.

226
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:41,531
Monami...

227
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,782
You have...

228
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,355
The right to live your life
the way you want.

229
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:05,989
Heisuke.

230
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,590
All this time...

231
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,606
I've made you suffer.

232
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,957
Monami.

233
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,221
Daddy...

234
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,739
I'm so confused.

235
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,073
I know I was on
a bus with mama...

236
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:10,574
Why am I here?

237
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:15,719
Monami?

238
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,719
Something wrong, daddy?

239
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,328
Monami?

240
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,833
What are you saying?

241
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:37,173
Monami...
You don't remember anything?

242
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:49,654
Mama...

243
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:54,055
Keep calm and listen.
Your mother's not with us.

244
00:31:56,565 --> 00:32:00,296
The bus you were on
had an accident.

245
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:06,002
Ahh, no, no...
Your mother is still alive.

246
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,974
I don't get it.

247
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,840
Your mother has...
lived 2 years as Monami.

248
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,849
And entered medical school.

249
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:35,861
Wait...!
Wait a minute.

250
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,705
It's a lie. I can't believe that.

251
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,054
After two years...

252
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,719
The girl's true
personality returned.

253
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:05,060
It hurts.

254
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:09,431
My head hurts.

255
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:11,132
Monami.

256
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:21,246
Monami.

257
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,909
Monami.

258
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:56,915
Heisuke.

259
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:05,417
What's wrong with me?
I feel weird.

260
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,160
Naoko...?

261
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:20,605
Monami returned just now.

262
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:33,652
I'm sure she'll return again.
Oh, I'm so glad.

263
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:40,090
It'll be hard for Monami
to understand all this.

264
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:45,159
I can write down the details
and tell her everything.

265
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,367
We don't know when
she'll return.

266
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:53,697
Just after I wake up.
That's when...

267
00:34:56,044 --> 00:35:00,344
I can't doze off
in class. Right?

268
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:05,818
Daddy...

269
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:09,052
Monami?

270
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:14,821
I must have been
sound asleep.

271
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:17,427
Yeah.

272
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:27,166
With love, Mama

273
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:39,186
So, lots of things happened.

274
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,880
Ah... a lot.

275
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:48,355
I'll write to mama, too.

276
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,049
Monami?

277
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,890
Too bad, it's Naoko.

278
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:29,199
Today, you didn't miss any.
Look, Monami's letter.

279
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,564
Let's see.

280
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,371
Monami wants to study medicine.

281
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,039
Really?

282
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,408
But can she keep up in class?

283
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,607
Sure, the lectures are all
easy to follow.

284
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:47,052
Monami can catch-up.

285
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:48,820
I guess.

286
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:57,660
And I know it's time
for me to vanish.

287
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:00,462
Silly.

288
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:03,296
Three of us can live together.

289
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,739
Heisuke.

290
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:13,570
Stay by me until the time
Monami takes over.

291
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:26,457
Didn't you say,
We came from outer space?

292
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:34,758
We came from outer space.

293
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:47,110
Heisuke.

294
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:51,513
I think I'll let Monami
go to college pretty soon.

295
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:53,976
You think so?

296
00:37:56,724 --> 00:38:02,458
She'll get used to it, and her
awake time is getting longer.

297
00:38:15,243 --> 00:38:19,111
Not bad at all.
Now, I've got to go.

298
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:24,576
What's he happy about?

299
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,986
Good morning, mama.

300
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,121
Rather, good evening.

301
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:40,495
I never saw those words
in the textbooks.

302
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:48,131
But somehow I understand them.
I can solve ordinary math problems.

303
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:54,611
Your mama hammered it all
into the brain. That's why.

304
00:38:55,416 --> 00:39:01,184
Thank you mama!
I'm counting on you. Thank you!

305
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,189
Silly girl, Monami.

306
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:12,989
I cooked your borsch recipe.
It's in the pot. Try some.

307
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,832
All right, I'll have some.

308
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,166
What do you think?

309
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:21,970
Delicious

310
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:23,167
It wasn't easy.

311
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:24,174
It's good.

312
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:26,445
It's really good.

313
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:30,414
Don't you think I'm pretty good.

314
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:32,813
I just have one complaint

315
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:33,980
What?

316
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:36,086
She's careless with money.

317
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:38,725
The wallet quickly gets empty

318
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,591
She needs a scolding.

319
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:43,824
All right, I'll scold her.

320
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:46,125
We sure bought a lot of stuff.

321
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,070
Don't tell your mother.

322
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:54,364
Hello! It's been a long time.

323
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,066
Hi! How are you?

324
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,633
Welcome!

325
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:25,101
Great!

326
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:27,498
Thank you.

327
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:31,474
Hello.

328
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:36,182
How are you?

329
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,314
Careful, it's hot.

330
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:56,130
It's good.

331
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:57,661
What kind of broth?

332
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,663
It's a secret.

333
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:03,608
This is really good.

334
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:07,075
Will you come again?

335
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,107
I sure will.

336
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:29,493
Let's bring mama here next time.

337
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,238
I'm home

338
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,180
Welcome back.

339
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:44,882
Naoko?

340
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,220
How about going out
tonight?

341
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:55,086
Not today.

342
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,699
It's not easy to stay
up lately.

343
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,237
It isn't?

344
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,367
I'm sorry.

345
00:42:09,544 --> 00:42:13,503
I need more time to look
at you while I still can.

346
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:17,347
Silly. What are you saying?

347
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,726
Will I never be able to
see you again?

348
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,692
Stop that.

349
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,633
Anyway, let's go out.

350
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:40,798
If you eat something good,
your mood will change.

351
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:56,979
What do you say, Naoko?

352
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,404
Naoko!

353
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:19,409
I'm Monami.

354
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,109
Mama doesn't take over
too much lately.

355
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:27,250
So, I've got to take
care of the flowers.

356
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,187
Tomorrow, take me to
the Cape Lighthouse.

357
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,431
Is that mama's message?

358
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:44,730
Yes.

359
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,763
It was in her letter this morning.

360
00:44:29,317 --> 00:44:33,253
Mama, really loved this place.

361
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:39,791
Daddy...

362
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:46,261
Is it all right for me to return?

363
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:54,167
Of course it is.
I'm sure mama is delighted.

364
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:52,096
Heisuke.

365
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:05,875
This ice cream is so good.

366
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:13,044
Heisuke, what's funny?

367
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:19,926
On our first date you ate three.
Your appetite amazed me.

368
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:22,857
That's not true.
I ate two, not three.

369
00:46:23,264 --> 00:46:26,233
And you ate mine
down to here.

370
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:28,558
Only the cup was left.

371
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:36,206
You, in a "Darth Vader" T-shirt
and beach sandals.

372
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,570
It's still in fashion.

373
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:53,557
Heisuke.

374
00:46:57,298 --> 00:47:02,292
Thanks for taking me here
on my last day.

375
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,735
So, this is the last day?

376
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:20,344
I can feel it myself.

377
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,823
This is the last of Naoko.

378
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,259
Can't you do something
about it?

379
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,675
Good-bye. Heisuke.

380
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:38,527
Naoko!

381
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:48,341
Thank you.

382
00:48:54,215 --> 00:48:55,341
Please remember me.

383
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,284
Is she gone?

384
00:50:44,325 --> 00:50:45,792
I'll do my best.

385
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:55,028
I'll live for
mama's share, too.

386
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:17,182
A FEW YEARS LATER

387
00:52:56,857 --> 00:53:00,156
I'm glad I lived to see this day.

388
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:02,485
Where is Heisuke?

389
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:04,286
I bet he's crying in the toilet.

390
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:06,322
Just like our dad did?

391
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,730
Don't start that again.

392
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:14,237
Daddy.

393
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,865
All these years...
Thank you for everything.

394
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,352
Are you taking it to
the reception?

395
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:33,715
You are...

396
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:46,358
Was it you all this time?

397
00:55:07,654 --> 00:55:12,182
Taking it with you?

398
00:55:38,118 --> 00:55:42,077
This is the way you want...

399
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:56,635
So, here you are.

400
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,302
Fumiya.

401
00:56:03,844 --> 00:56:04,435
Yes

402
00:56:06,046 --> 00:56:07,274
I have a favor to ask.

403
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:10,309
What is it?

404
00:56:12,486 --> 00:56:16,616
Something a bride's father
wants to do at any cost.

405
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:22,626
Let me hit you.

406
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:27,029
Well... All right.

407
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:30,461
I can stand one blow.

408
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:33,004
Two blows.

409
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,241
One for taking my
daughter away...

410
00:56:43,717 --> 00:56:47,448
And one for someone else.

411
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:56,453
It hurts.

412
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:00,958
You really meant it.

413
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,579
Congratulations!
