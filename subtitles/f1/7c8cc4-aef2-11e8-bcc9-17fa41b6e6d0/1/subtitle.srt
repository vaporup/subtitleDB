9
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:17,512
Lots of snow!

10
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:25,592
Terrific! Not melted yet!

11
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:37,239
We came for a memorial service.
Not to go skiing.

12
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:39,908
Mama, you also want to ski, right?

13
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:46,578
Oh, I want to ski!
I'm dying to ski!

14
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:50,089
I can't wait to see Yoshimi.

15
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:53,124
Spring vacation's great.
No homework.

16
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,231
I thought you grew out of that.

17
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:05,768
My lucky charm.

18
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:10,208
It's so cute...
Give it to me.

19
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,207
Nope.

20
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,294
Look out!

21
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,167
Heisuke Sugita
Naoko
Monami

22
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,320
Rescued passengers
are badly injured.

23
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:14,361
Most in critical condition.

24
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,072
The latest report...

25
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:28,577
Regarding the mother and
daughter in the hospital...

26
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,338
They have been identified as,

27
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,348
Mrs. Sugita and her daughter.

28
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,613
The two women brought to
this hospital...

29
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,516
have been identified.

30
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,227
Their family name is Sugita.

31
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,759
We'll be going now.

32
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:57,401
Try to shave clean.

33
00:04:58,812 --> 00:04:59,744
Bye, now!

34
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,439
I'm Sugita.
Where's my wife and daughter?

35
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,447
Sugita? The trauma
section upstairs.

36
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,647
The trauma section.

37
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:40,414
Heisuke!

38
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,147
I don't know what to say...

39
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:46,087
If only I hadn't asked
them to come...

40
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,259
Doctor, doctor...

41
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:51,757
Mr. Sugita?

42
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:52,863
Yes.

43
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,291
Will they make it?

44
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:05,304
I'm afraid it's very critical.

45
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,748
You mean my wife...
or my daughter?

46
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,780
Both of them.

47
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,662
Doctor, the mother's VF!

48
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,424
Bosumin!

49
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:30,862
Hold on! What?

50
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,331
What?

51
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,705
Monami?

52
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:38,475
Don't worry.

53
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,240
She's right next to you.

54
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,149
Nurse... Help me.

55
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,889
Naoko!

56
00:06:58,698 --> 00:06:59,562
Hold on!

57
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:03,997
Naoko!

58
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:05,865
Naoko!

59
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:07,664
Naoko!

60
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:14,337
Naoko!

61
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,048
Mama...

62
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,007
This way please.

63
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:23,723
Naoko...

64
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:27,718
Monami...

65
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,121
Monami.

66
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,619
You're awake...

67
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:40,791
What?

68
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,168
Am I... dead?

69
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:52,139
Monami.

70
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,146
You're alive!

71
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:59,351
I'll get the doctor!

72
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:01,881
Wait, Heisuke.

73
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,623
It's me, Naoko.

74
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,125
What?

75
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:17,627
What are you saying?

76
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,033
Monami.

77
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:23,937
Heisuke...

78
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,171
I'm Naoko.

79
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:39,983
- H i m i t s u -

80
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,255
What are you saying?

81
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:45,961
Are you all right, Monami?

82
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,197
No.
I'm Naoko.

83
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:52,863
Can't you see?

84
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,240
No! It's impossible.

85
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,703
I can't believe it myself.

86
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:03,679
But it's true.

87
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,753
Now, don't kid daddy.

88
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:11,121
I'm not.

89
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,588
No.

90
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:21,059
Then, tell me about
the first date we had.

91
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:24,703
We ate ice cream
at the Cape Lighthouse.

92
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:27,737
And then?

93
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,804
We went to Chinatown.

94
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:35,404
You ate 5 dishes of noodles in soup.

95
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,447
Different kinds of noodles.

96
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,576
Also fried noodles.

97
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:52,362
And do you remember the night
you spent at my place?

98
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:53,995
Yes,

99
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:56,760
It was winter.

100
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,097
While we were doing it
you were so clumsy.

101
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,638
You had a leg cramp.
A big commotion.

102
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:08,736
Tell me, are you still alive?

103
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:12,247
Naoko...

104
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,911
Naoko?

105
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,705
Does it mean that Monami
is the one who is dead?

106
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:44,906
I took over Monami's body.

107
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,924
If it's possible to bring Monami
back...

108
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,232
I'll do whatever it takes.

109
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:14,474
For now...

110
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:17,850
Better not tell anyone.

111
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,049
Heisuke...

112
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,560
What'll I do now?

113
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,310
I'm home.

114
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,211
Wow, what a mess.

115
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,318
Heisuke, open the window.

116
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,311
It's pretty awkward.

117
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,452
Heisuke, did you water them?

118
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,229
Sometimes.

119
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,792
I knew it.

120
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:20,769
They're withering.
The poor things.

121
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:22,802
Drink lots of water.

122
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,014
There!

123
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,618
Come on, pep up!

124
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:46,688
Now you'll revive.

125
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:55,706
Heisuke, come and help me.

126
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:10,522
Heisuke...

127
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:15,186
Am I in a dream?

128
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,588
Will you be all right alone?

129
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,917
I'll be fine.

130
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:53,565
You missed some.

131
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,261
So, you're Naoko.

132
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:57,568
See you later.

133
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:00,739
I'll see you later.

134
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:29,025
A little bland.

135
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:34,138
But chief, we thought a mild
flavor would sell better.

136
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:37,834
Chinese noodles must taste
good from the first bite.

137
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:42,440
So-called mild soy sauce
contains a lot of salt.

138
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:43,478
Yes...

139
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,982
It has a good broth flavor.

140
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,153
A little more effort.

141
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:50,787
And the noodles.

142
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:52,656
I'm confident of that.

143
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:57,652
I think the chief
looks pretty weary.

144
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:00,258
After what happened,
of course.

145
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,474
Come on! Get up!
You'll be late.

146
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,146
5 more minutes.

147
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,779
No! Get up!

148
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,014
No!
I want to sleep more

149
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:27,916
Get up right now.
You hear me?

150
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:29,855
Stop it!

151
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:32,088
I'll sleep with you.

152
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,348
Research of
possession phenomenon,

153
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,521
By religion, natural
science and psychology,

154
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:01,952
continues extensively...

155
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:05,661
There is an interesting case.

156
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:10,867
It happened to a girl in France.

157
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:13,528
She had smallpox...

158
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,870
And was in a state of
suspended death...

159
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:25,741
She recovered with another
person's personality.

160
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,582
A woman who died
at about the same time,

161
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:34,924
Was believed to have
possessed the girl.

162
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,936
It's green! Look! Look!

163
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:49,368
The girl knew everything
about the dead woman.

164
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,935
her condition lasted
for two years.

165
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,976
Then, the girl's true
personality returned.

166
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:09,550
I'm home.

167
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:34,919
She must be Naoko

168
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:43,490
Monami...

169
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,129
It's me, Naoko.

170
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,226
Hi, there.

171
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:51,326
What in the...?

172
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,938
Look like a teenager?

173
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,475
Maybe the skirt is too short?

174
00:19:58,677 --> 00:19:59,473
No...

175
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,475
Stop staring, Heisuke.

176
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,377
Cut it out!

177
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:07,142
I can't help it.

178
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,648
Heisuke!

179
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,957
Stop it...

180
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:13,551
See?

181
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,637
Heisuke.

182
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:30,068
You know what I think?

183
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,938
I should be Monami when
we're outside the house.

184
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:42,053
It's an idea...

185
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:46,051
We don't have a choice.

186
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:52,955
Being your wife in
the house won't change.

187
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,063
Right.

188
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:05,377
I can't keep wearing this ring.

189
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,796
From now on this will be
my wedding ring

190
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:06,802
I'll keep mine on.

191
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,440
That's nice of you.

192
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:17,847
But...

193
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,780
You're over 40, can you
be a high school girl?

194
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:33,860
I can... I can!

195
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,734
That's already out of date.

196
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:42,303
You've got to get busy
with a lot of catching up.

197
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,643
Now, go to sleep.

198
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:47,675
We're a real weird couple.

199
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:49,404
Ah, shut up.

200
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:07,462
This sure brings
back memories.

201
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:09,595
Monami!

202
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:14,904
Why, hello.

203
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:17,836
Are you all right now?

204
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:19,904
Kuniko?

205
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,172
Gee, you grew up.

206
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,743
Same class?

207
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:33,547
What's with your skirt?

208
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,856
What?

209
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:37,086
It's too long.

210
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:40,556
Are you feeling better?
Just take it easy, okay?

211
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:41,927
Smile.

212
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:43,927
Yeah, thanks.

213
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:44,864
Let's go.

214
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:49,370
She's gone through this terrible
trauma...

215
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:52,573
She forgets
faces and names.

216
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,544
I see...

217
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:59,241
She might find it very
hard to keep up in class.

218
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,643
A new term is starting.

219
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,879
She's a good student.
She'll be fine.

220
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:08,026
No, I don't really think so.

221
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:16,026
I'm sure she can't even
socialize with anyone.

222
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:24,742
Don't worry about
her in school.

223
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:26,540
Yes...

224
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,812
Good morning.

225
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:44,262
Monami!

226
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,924
You're... Odajima, right?

227
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:51,493
Ah, yes.

228
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,162
I'm glad you're with us.

229
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:55,598
Me too.

230
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,107
I sure am glad.

231
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:02,573
Why'd you bother with him?

232
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:05,308
He was a classmate before.

233
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:07,942
So, you talked to him?

234
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:12,319
Could you ignore him?

235
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,057
I guess not.

236
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:14,920
Monami!

237
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,086
Long time no see.

238
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,835
The second function...

239
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:30,074
f (x) equals...

240
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:33,707
a x squared plus...

241
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:37,144
b x plus c...

242
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:40,647
Find the value of the
constant a, b, c.

243
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,013
I give up.

244
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:46,456
Help me, Monami.

245
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:51,224
Anyone have the answer?

246
00:25:58,904 --> 00:25:59,836
Miss Sugita.

247
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,206
You mean... me?

248
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,940
Yes.

249
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:15,820
I'll wash your back.

250
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:18,288
No thanks.

251
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:20,291
Why?

252
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:21,721
It's just...

253
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,486
Come on, I always do.

254
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,188
Yeah, right.

255
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:32,161
You're Naoko, yeah.

256
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,506
How's school?

257
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:39,369
Exhausting.

258
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,034
Kids are all around me.

259
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:42,736
That's natural.

260
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,382
Something's weird.

261
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:48,547
What?

262
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,712
I thought math was
beyond me completely,

263
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,290
But it's easy to come
up with answers.

264
00:26:56,962 --> 00:27:00,898
The conscious mind is yours,
but the brain is Monami's.

265
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,228
The brain determines
talent and ability.

266
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:08,996
You and Monami have the
same thought patterns.

267
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,101
Maybe that's it.

268
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,014
Finished.

269
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,880
Get in the tub.

270
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:23,850
Thanks.

271
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:31,293
Hey!

272
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:33,060
Don't be shy.

273
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:37,399
Cut it out.

274
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:40,905
Regarding indemnity...

275
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:44,565
Depending on the victim's
sex and age...

276
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:49,110
The sum will differ from
50 to 80 million yen.

277
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,943
Can't you get at least
100 million?

278
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:53,311
That's too cheap.

279
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,112
Is life that cheap?

280
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:57,619
Give my son back!

281
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,850
All of you have
a document...

282
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,856
That calculates the
formula for indemnity.

283
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:09,260
You apply it
to figure out the amount.

284
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:13,268
So, the amount can be
roughly decided.

285
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,501
My two sons who just
started work were killed.

286
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:20,173
They're not the same
as somebody's wife.

287
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,272
200 million yen each!

288
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:30,649
Well...

289
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,450
Do you know the
cause of the accident?

290
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,155
Yes.

291
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:42,959
The bus company admits
it was the driver's fault.

292
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,295
After a thorough inquiry?

293
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:47,638
It won't bring back the dead!

294
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,302
Demand a thorough check
of the accident.

295
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:59,010
It's what the people who
died want to know.

296
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,119
Very well.

297
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,315
The issue of overwork
of the driver...

298
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,623
And other factors to be
double checked.

299
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,690
Will be demanded from
the bus company.

300
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:10,787
Please do that.

301
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:12,295
I will.

302
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,606
Money is the least concern.

303
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,474
It's not the money...

304
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:27,335
One more thing.

305
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:32,242
The driver's son, Kajikawa,
is here.

306
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:37,377
He wishes to make an
apology to everyone.

307
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:39,746
Is it all right?

308
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:43,353
Then, Kajikawa, please.

309
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:05,208
Please accept...

310
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:08,816
I'm sorry...

311
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,084
That's no way to apologize.

312
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:19,654
How many people are dead?

313
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,761
Be more sincere.

314
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:26,660
Who do you think you are?

315
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,268
Your father did it!

316
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:42,216
My dad's not a murderer!

317
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:45,514
What's that?

318
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:49,988
Come back here!

319
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:04,836
Wait a minute.

320
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:07,942
You were pretty rude.

321
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:11,641
He's the one.

322
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:15,978
He calls every night.

323
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:19,022
Saying my dad's a murderer.

324
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,985
I recognize his voice.

325
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:31,392
No compassion for the
victim's families?

326
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:33,701
I feel sorry for them.

327
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:37,575
For you too.

328
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:44,212
But my dad didn't cause
the accident on purpose.

329
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:53,783
The bus company puts
all the blame on him.

330
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:59,723
You have other family?

331
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,723
No. That's why I came.

332
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,229
Wait...

333
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:14,705
He has an attitude.

334
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:18,606
He's having a hard time.

335
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:21,617
He's going to college?

336
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:23,386
Who knows?

337
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:28,051
If he worked overtime
for the tuition...

338
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:30,057
The victims can't rest in peace.

339
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:33,225
Who worked overtime?

340
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:35,056
The driver.

341
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:39,631
I heard him talking on the bus.

342
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:42,698
Kajikawa, it's your turn.

343
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:45,573
Yeah, sorry.

344
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,269
Are you all right?

345
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:51,741
I didn't sleep last night.

346
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,908
Driving a truck again?

347
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,114
You're risking your job.

348
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:59,620
But driving is the only
work I can do.

349
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:02,357
Isn't moonlighting hard?

350
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:03,858
Not too bad.

351
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:09,527
It means happiness to my
family. That's what.

352
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:12,802
Maybe he dozed off
at the wheel.

353
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,804
I'll do the indemnity
negotiations.

354
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:20,475
So, forget about the
accident.

355
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,916
Monami!

356
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:36,153
Pass it on!

357
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:37,693
Pass! Pass the ball!

358
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,007
Miss Sugita.

359
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:54,143
Yes.

360
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:55,841
Catch you later.

361
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:58,146
How do you feel?

362
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,508
I'm fine.

363
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,315
Take care of yourself.

364
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:02,480
Yes.

365
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:06,946
That girl's worrying about
me makes me tired.

366
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:11,128
Don't be ungrateful.
She's a fine teacher.

367
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,093
You're taking her side.

368
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:15,298
Silly.

369
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,301
But you know...

370
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,305
She's always watching me.

371
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:25,734
It suffocates me.
Maybe she's suspicious.

372
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:27,310
About what?

373
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:29,404
That I'm not Monami.

374
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:32,815
Silly. She's worried
about you, that's all.

375
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:43,524
That sure is a pretty
heavy meal.

376
00:34:44,562 --> 00:34:48,396
I want to eat solid food,
'cause I'm young.

377
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:51,429
Young. I see.

378
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:54,938
Heisuke, what about it?

379
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:56,403
What?

380
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:58,071
Sex.

381
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:03,974
Heisuke, shame on you.

382
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:05,815
Why sex, out of the blue?

383
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:08,879
Well, we talked about
my teacher, Miss Hashimoto.

384
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:10,076
That's irrelevant.

385
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,687
Well, what'll you do?

386
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:17,221
What'll I do?

387
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:20,922
What can I do?

388
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,057
To my own daughter?

389
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,339
You think I can make love?

390
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:31,874
I guess not.

391
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:14,547
Mr. Sugita?

392
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:16,579
Yes?

393
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:18,884
It's been a while.

394
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,216
Yes, it has...

395
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:24,156
A medical school?

396
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,293
Yes.

397
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,224
It will be hard on her,
changing her subjects.

398
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:32,597
Why in the world?

399
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,803
You have any inkling?

400
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,504
No.

401
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:42,607
Shall we sit down?

402
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,152
Thank you.

403
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,841
I didn't know we
were neighbors.

404
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:18,881
I live further down
the road.

405
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:21,815
Alone?

406
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:23,044
Yes, that's right.

407
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:25,678
Is that so...

408
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:36,691
Well, now...

409
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,834
What's she up to
with Heisuke?

410
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:42,269
Well, I must be going.

411
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,071
Thank you.

412
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,176
Say hello to Monami.

413
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:46,833
Yes.

414
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:47,909
Good-bye.

415
00:37:57,956 --> 00:37:59,116
I caught you.

416
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,318
You startled me.
Were you listening?

417
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,561
Wipe off the grin.

418
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:09,995
Who, me?

419
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:14,035
She's your type all right.

420
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:16,063
What's that mean?

421
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:17,533
You're nuts!

422
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:22,608
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

423
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:32,618
I want to study
cerebral medicine.

424
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:37,327
I want to discover
what happened to me.

425
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:39,387
I thought so.

426
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:44,663
But can science cure it?

427
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:49,869
Maybe not, but I want
to try.

428
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:56,008
Just living and feeling
skeptical isn't easy.

429
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:58,542
I guess not.

430
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:02,449
0ne other thing...

431
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:07,888
I don't want to waste
reliving a life.

432
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:13,897
With Monami's body,
I want to do what I want.

433
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,064
For Monami's sake too.

434
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:22,263
I feel like I'm being
outstripped.

435
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,701
No good?

436
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:31,676
I'll back you up.

437
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:35,544
I can still work
for 20 more years.

438
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:46,960
Hey!

439
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:48,529
What?

440
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:51,794
Is your skirt shorter?

441
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,434
This is normal.

442
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:59,075
Come on.
You're over forty.

443
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:02,072
You hear? Naoko!

444
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:04,206
Naoko?

445
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:11,349
Famous foreign literature,

446
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:16,016
Tolstoi, "War and Peace".

447
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:42,647
Hey.

448
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:44,084
Naoko!

449
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:45,683
Look! Look!

450
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:47,480
Hey!

451
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:49,824
Naoko!

452
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,187
Be quiet!

453
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,422
I'm starving!

454
00:40:57,568 --> 00:41:00,435
Lots of pickles,

455
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,468
Here! Here!

456
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,629
Not me!

457
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:09,510
So, the test is tomorrow.

458
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:12,811
No problem.

459
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:14,648
That's good.

460
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:19,646
Here's something we put
all our energy in.

461
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:23,321
Please.

462
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,291
"CONCENTRATl0N"

463
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:02,859
If you don't pass,
there's always next year.

464
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:04,959
And another year afterwards.

465
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:08,171
If I didn't pass, then no one
passed.

466
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:10,673
You're amazing.

467
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:18,144
Look! There it is!

468
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,340
Where? Where?

469
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,810
0705

470
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:22,244
705
Na-o-ko!

471
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:24,181
Oh, I see it.

472
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,353
Thanks to my noodle power.

473
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:28,082
Yes? Yes!

474
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:45,133
One order of Sushi.

475
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:45,968
Right!

476
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:49,406
We haven't been here
for awhile.

477
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,644
Yeah.

478
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:51,812
Here...

479
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:55,977
It's my happiest time
to be with you like this.

480
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:58,412
Yes, it is.

481
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:06,489
Say, Heisuke.

482
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:11,729
If you fancy that girl...

483
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:13,900
Girl?

484
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,237
The teacher,
Taeko Hashimoto.

485
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:21,803
That kid, Taeko?

486
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:24,571
Now's the time
to make a move.

487
00:43:28,052 --> 00:43:31,044
I've got you, Naoko.

488
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:40,653
Thank you.

489
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,565
You missed some.

490
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,168
Cut it out.

491
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:00,108
Here. Herring.

492
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,983
You all right? Here...

493
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:35,676
It might help
if I hide my face.

494
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:42,848
And I'll be quiet.

495
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:53,288
It just isn't right to do
it to Monami's body.

496
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:02,605
I can use my mouth.

497
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:12,776
Don't say that
with Monami's face.

498
00:46:24,195 --> 00:46:25,253
All right.

499
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:29,362
Well...

500
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:34,169
I'll sleep in Monami's
room from tomorrow.

501
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:48,341
I guess you should.

502
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:54,317
Maybe we should have
done that sooner.

503
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:09,230
Can I sleep here
just for tonight?

504
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:14,273
Yeah.

505
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:28,956
For Monami's entering
medical college!

506
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:30,525
Bottoms up!

507
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:32,194
Congratulations!

508
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:36,625
Daddy! Hurry up
and come here!

509
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:37,663
Here.

510
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:46,735
I promised Monami before.

511
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:48,172
Right?

512
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:57,082
You said you wanted to
eat grandpa's noodles.

513
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:03,820
Oh, yes, I was dying for it.
and I love this.

514
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:05,023
Yes, yes!

515
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:15,199
Delicious.

516
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:33,680
I'm sorry.

517
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:39,589
My mother really loved
grandpa's noodles.

518
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:01,748
Tasty!

519
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:06,319
Really good.

520
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:13,853
Monami, do you have
a boyfriend?

521
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:15,093
Why...

522
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:16,564
No way!

523
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:17,256
Why not?

524
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:18,435
Over my dead body.

525
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,370
That's 'father-talk', Heisuke.

526
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:24,640
She'll find a nice guy and get
married before you know it.

527
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:27,737
The day you got married
to Naoko...

528
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:30,607
Our dad cried his eyes out.

529
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:32,980
He said he wanted to hit
you, Heisuke.

530
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,046
Nonsense.

531
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:35,048
But you cried.

532
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:36,481
That never happened.

533
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,144
He really said that.

534
00:49:53,037 --> 00:49:54,868
Where's your dad?

535
00:49:55,706 --> 00:49:56,638
In the bath.

536
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:04,545
That's nice.

537
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:10,947
It feels stiff here.

538
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,055
You can tell?

539
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:17,660
Yeah, dad, you always feel
stiff right here...

540
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:18,453
What?

541
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:24,393
I mean, my dad gets
a stiff back too.

542
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:27,100
He does?

543
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:32,236
You rub his back too
like a good girl.

544
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,278
Monami.

545
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:41,747
Yes?

546
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,880
You've grown up now.

547
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:49,955
So, if your dad finds a
suitable lady...

548
00:50:50,394 --> 00:50:52,919
Let's give him our
blessing, all right?

549
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:03,664
Yeah.

550
00:51:52,189 --> 00:51:55,989
Monami... I wonder
where she is now?

551
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:04,758
Damn it all!

552
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:19,579
Damn it!

553
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:41,363
Thank you for waiting.
This way please.

554
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:48,668
Here's the menu.
Please take you time.

555
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:52,714
I'll be back in a moment.

556
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,758
Welcome. How many in
the party?

557
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:06,651
Ah, just a second.

558
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,467
What the...?

559
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:14,131
What's wrong?

560
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,766
Guess I lost my wallet.

561
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:22,307
Come on, dad, you've
got to watch over me.

562
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:23,811
I'll pay.

563
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:24,845
All right?

564
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:26,580
Thank you.

565
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:27,846
All right?

566
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,084
Thanks.

567
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:34,923
Heisuke...

568
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,190
It can happen to anyone.

569
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,939
Hi.

570
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:00,545
Hello.

571
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:04,410
The money I owe you.

572
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:08,020
You came all the way here
to pay me back? Come in.

573
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,485
I've got to go.

574
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:11,895
Thanks anyway

575
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,565
Thank you.

576
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:23,939
Are you getting worker's
compensation?

577
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:26,373
No.

578
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,309
The company found out
dad was moonlighting.

579
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:34,147
I see... And how about
your college?

580
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:37,284
I quit.

581
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:42,650
I got a job in
a noodle shop.

582
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,757
You did? Where?

583
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:46,151
In Yotsuya.

584
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:48,761
Yotsuya? That's near
my company.

585
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:50,700
Do you know the "Kouya"?

586
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:54,062
Yes, it's catty-corner from a
sushi shop.

587
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:57,602
And the "Avalanche"
noodle shop nearby...

588
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:11,052
You wanted to know the
cause of the accident.

589
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:17,660
I think my dad dozed off
while driving.

590
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,393
He was working recklessly.

591
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,495
And it was all for you.

592
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:30,102
Maybe.

593
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:32,370
Our life was never easy.

594
00:55:33,443 --> 00:55:35,377
Maybe he had a gambling debt.

595
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,474
He liked to gamble.

596
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:54,957
What sick people need,
is not famous scholars.

597
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:59,226
They need good clinicians.

598
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:03,634
This is the basic doctrine
of our school.

599
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,202
Never let it fade from
your mind...

600
00:56:07,044 --> 00:56:09,376
During the 6 years
you will study here.

601
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,715
For the many patients and
their families you'll meet,

602
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:18,712
Do become good doctors.

603
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:39,934
Join the sailboat club?

604
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:43,740
I'll be busy studying.

605
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:46,606
Anyone who only studies
won't make a good doctor.

606
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:50,682
Physical stamina is vital
for doctors.

607
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,449
Well... No thank you.

608
00:56:58,528 --> 00:56:59,426
Doctors need stamina!

609
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,225
One two! One two!

610
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:04,195
Doctors need stamina!

611
00:57:04,434 --> 00:57:06,129
One two! One two!

612
00:57:09,172 --> 00:57:11,003
I'm scared!

613
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:14,909
Sugita! Pull!

614
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,778
Pull!

615
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:19,773
Pull the jib!

616
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:22,016
Stay cool!

617
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:24,415
Stay put!

618
00:57:26,022 --> 00:57:27,080
Look forward!

619
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:30,927
Let go of the jib!

620
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:32,353
Loosen the sheet!

621
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:36,892
Don't stand up!

622
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,294
We'll capsize!

623
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:39,430
Stay cool!

624
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:42,234
I'm trying my best!

625
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:43,934
Sailboats?

626
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,501
Stamina is vital
for doctors.

627
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:48,840
Risky?

628
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:51,677
They're all experts.

629
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,948
And they are... men?

630
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:04,426
A German farmer wanted to
hunt badgers.

631
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:08,957
So, they crossed a dog with a
strong jaw and...

632
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:13,531
A dog with short legs,
and that made dachshunds.
