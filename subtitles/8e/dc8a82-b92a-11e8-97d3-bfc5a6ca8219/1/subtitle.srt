1
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,849
Evelyn, did Jesus have a big sister?

2
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:55,027
No, Dermot, he didn't.
He wasn't as lucky as you.

3
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:58,830
He had two daddies, though.
God the Father and Joseph the carpenter.

4
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:02,095
Did Joseph ever do a bit of painting
and decorating like my dad?

5
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:11,402
Evelyn, you take the boys home.
I'll go find your mother.

6
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:13,138
- All right, Dad.
- Good girl.

7
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,651
I want the big one.

8
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:01,489
The big one's mine.
I'm the biggest. Come on.

9
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:04,620
I told you I was just going to the pub
for a Christmas drink.

10
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:06,164
Why kick up such a fuss?

11
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,328
Who was he?
You were all over him like a bloody rash.

12
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:10,562
Don't be stupid.

13
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:12,705
Sounds like Mommy and Daddy are back.

14
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,864
Right in front of all our friends, too.

15
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,709
Jesus.

16
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,479
You frozen little mites.

17
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,145
Come here, now.

18
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,548
We were arguing
if the chimney was wide enough for Santa.

19
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:29,214
It's great we're on the top floor
so Santa can park his reindeers, and that.

20
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,486
It is. He's got the whole roof to land on.
Say goodnight to Mommy.

21
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,083
When will Santa be here?

22
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,060
Santa's gonna be here very soon.

23
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,093
Off to bed with the lot of you.

24
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:41,395
- Santa will come when you're asleep.
- I won't be able to sleep.

25
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:44,733
You will, love. Take your jumper
and boots off. Not up on the bed.

26
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:46,635
- You all right?
- Yes, Daddy.

27
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:49,368
Okay. All right. Night-night.

28
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,118
Daddy, where's the carriages?

29
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:12,421
Son, Santa was a bit
strapped for cash this year.

30
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,131
It costs a lot of money to feed those elves.

31
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,533
How much do they cost?

32
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,971
It costs lots and lots.

33
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:23,101
Happy Christmas.

34
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,336
Granddad!

35
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:32,545
My little Christmas angel.
I hope you were a good girl. Were you?

36
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:35,383
- There's Granddad.
- Happy Christmas, everybody!

37
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,359
All right. Look at what you've got there.

38
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:43,458
Thanks, Granddad!

39
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,387
Granddad!

40
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,307
No money, no job.

41
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,518
Happy Christmas.

42
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,357
Look on the bright side, son.

43
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,420
Come the New Year, you'll have a new job.

44
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:18,964
You and the kids will be set up.
The world will be your oyster.

45
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,357
We never died a winter yet.

46
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,005
Oh, of all the money

47
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:30,033
that ever I earned

48
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,544
I spent it in good company

49
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:39,077
And all the harm that ever I done

50
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,819
Heidi, we're going to see Angela.

51
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,453
She's my best friend.

52
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:50,795
She has a dolly, too.

53
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm sure she'd like to meet you.

54
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:57,566
Mommy's going shopping, Heidi.

55
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,698
Do you like her nice new shoes and coat?

56
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,935
But this is St. Stephen's Day.

57
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:08,777
Mommy, come back, it's St. Stephen's Day.
The shops are shut!

58
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,579
Daddy!

59
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:52,790
Be quiet.

60
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,417
- Daddy!
- What?

61
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:59,263
Mommy's gone. She was all dressed up
when she went away with a man in a car.

62
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:14,772
Jesus, don't let me down now. Come on.

63
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:21,744
She's your daughter.
You say you don't know where she's gone?

64
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:24,016
She's your wife,
and you don't know, do you?

65
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,615
I always said this would end in tears.

66
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:29,491
Should never have got stuck
with a corner boy like you.

67
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:30,927
Who's her fancy man?

68
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:33,795
Is it the bastard I saw her with in the pub?

69
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:37,497
- Your language is appalling.
- Your bloody...

70
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,831
Your bloody daughter is appalling.

71
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:43,205
I hope you don't use language like that
in front of your daughter.

72
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,744
Don't tell me how to bring up
my own daughter.

73
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,244
You obviously know sweet F.A. About it.

74
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:50,305
Where did she meet him? In the pub?

75
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,084
No, you're the one who spends all his time
there. No wonder she got sick of you.

76
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,248
- I treated her well.
- Yeah?

77
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:01,259
I never raised a hand in anger to her once,
though she gave me just cause for it.

78
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:03,090
Maybe that's where I went wrong.

79
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:30,713
Here you are, love.

80
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,221
Hot milk.

81
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:34,653
Christmas pudding.

82
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,057
You want some of this?

83
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,164
It's very nice.

84
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:43,428
No.

85
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:46,503
Why not? You must be starving.

86
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,465
She made it.

87
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:43,293
Maurice, give him the ball back.

88
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,198
I hear her fancy man is English.

89
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:52,003
Bastard. I might have guessed.

90
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:53,829
Good day, gentlemen.

91
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:56,205
I'm Inspector Logan of the SPCC.

92
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:59,909
Mrs. Daisley, your mother-in-law, I believe,
told us of your plight.

93
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,570
The SPCC?

94
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,809
The Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Children?

95
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:06,909
That's correct.

96
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:09,352
Is she saying
that I've been cruel to my kids?

97
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,049
Not at all, Mr. Doyle.

98
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,923
We only have the children's welfare at heart.

99
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:17,053
To lose their mother at this age
can have a traumatizing effect.

100
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,757
How's that any business of yours?

101
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,230
I'm here to help you.

102
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,058
I understand you've no income
to support your family.

103
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:24,125
- Correct?
- Yeah.

104
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,433
Do you have any female relatives
to call upon?

105
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,634
Maureen. Des' mother, died a long time ago.

106
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:34,875
Then, Mr. Doyle, you have no choice but
to approach the authorities for assistance.

107
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,174
I will arrange for the Sisters to call.

108
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,979
We don't need your charity.

109
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:41,748
You have no job
and no mother for your children.

110
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,521
He's right, son.

111
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,421
All right.

112
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,197
Send in the nuns.

113
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:05,972
Sit still.

114
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,437
But I don't like cabbage.

115
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:12,280
It is very good for you.
Eat it up. I don't want to hear about it.

116
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:21,224
You are a painter and decorator by trade,
but your attempts to secure employment...

117
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,785
since your wife's departure
have been unsuccessful.

118
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,490
Yes, sir. Your Honor.

119
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,363
But it's only been a couple of weeks.

120
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:31,870
And there's a big job coming up
at the Robert West House...

121
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,833
but that's not until the end of March.

122
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:37,068
And you have no other source of revenue?

123
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,306
Sir, my father, Henry,
who's sitting here, and myself...

124
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,213
we're setting up a tour of the Dublin pubs.

125
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:46,717
Surely that will represent expenditure
rather than income.

126
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:47,946
No, Your Honor.

127
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,387
We'll be playing music for money.

128
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,515
My father was a professional musician.

129
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,892
He played for Radio Éireann
until retirement age.

130
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,227
Dessie has a fine voice, Your Honor.

131
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,925
I'm sure he has.

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,993
But you won't be able to support your family
on that alone, will you?

133
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,273
Maybe not, Your Honor.

134
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,851
Under Section 10
of the Children's Act, 1941...

135
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:27,518
I hereby rule that
until there is a significant improvement...

136
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:31,552
in the domestic and financial circumstances
of Desmond Doyle...

137
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:35,690
his two sons, Dermot and Maurice...

138
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,561
will be placed in care
of the Christian Brothers in Kilkenny...

139
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,665
and his daughter, Evelyn Doyle...

140
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:47,011
will be committed
to St. Joseph's School in Dublin.

141
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:51,378
And I hope you don't have to leave them
in care for too long.

142
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,284
Daddy!

143
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:05,160
Come here. Come sit down.

144
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:08,028
- I wanna go home.
- I know you wanna go home.

145
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:10,865
We're gonna go home soon. Listen.

146
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,931
I love you very much.
You must understand that.

147
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,011
Granddad, there's St. Joseph, Jesus' daddy!

148
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:58,242
I'll pray to him to get us home.
He'll understand.

149
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,808
That's right, love, he'll understand.

150
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,734
Mr. Doyle, I'm Brother Eustace.

151
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,172
Look at the rays.

152
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,618
- Do you know what these are?
- No, Granddad.

153
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,015
Angel rays.

154
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:11,953
- Angel rays?
- Yes.

155
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:17,322
These mean that your guardian angel is
reminding you that he's waiting to help you.

156
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,956
All you have to do is believe in him.

157
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,868
Angel rays.

158
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,838
Look, pet, your favorites.

159
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,375
He's helping you already.

160
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:38,278
Granddad, please don't leave me here.

161
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:41,787
I don't want to stay here with the Sisters.
I hate them!

162
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,816
They're the Brides of Christ.

163
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,290
Then why do they wear
black, horrible dresses?

164
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:49,623
Brides should wear white dresses!

165
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,855
What's going on?
Have you been bold, young lady?

166
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:56,594
It's all right.
I just dropped a tube of fruit gums.

167
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:58,864
- Come along, now.
- No.

168
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,307
Granddad, please don't go.

169
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,901
- Let go, now.
- Let go of me!

170
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:06,308
Please, Granddad!

171
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:11,774
Please be a good girl for the Sisters.
I'll come back and see you soon.

172
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,648
Disgraceful performance.

173
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,320
We'll teach you some manners in here.

174
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:20,225
We'll get you cleaned up,
you dirty little tinker.

175
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,355
Mr. Doyle.

176
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,534
Sister, please don't cut her hair.

177
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,066
It's her father's pride and joy.

178
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,186
Thank you, Sister Brigid.
I'm sure we'll manage fine.

179
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,956
One large nun should be enough
to scrub one small girl.

180
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,550
Of course, Sister Felicity.

181
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:58,461
I was just making sure
she didn't throw another tantrum.

182
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,087
She's a willful one.

183
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,631
Wasn't our Lord a willful one, too?

184
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,396
I'm sure she'll be fine. Won't you?

185
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,040
Thank you, Sister Brigid.

186
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:14,370
Don't look so worried.

187
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:17,444
This is standard procedure for new girls.

188
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:22,180
Otherwise, the place would be jumping
with lice and fleas and God knows what.

189
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,813
Come on, take your clothes off.

190
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,783
Don't be shy.

191
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:30,459
After all...

192
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,987
bare-naked
is how God created Adam and Eve.

193
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,568
It's how he sent the Baby Jesus
into the world.

194
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,798
Good.

195
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,373
We'll have you squeaky clean
in no time at all.

196
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,945
Come on, sit down.

197
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,978
Shoes.

198
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,777
You can call me Felicity.

199
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:57,481
What's your name?

200
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,581
Evelyn Doyle.

201
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,459
Pleased to meet you.

202
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,319
Pleased to meet you, Sister Felicity.

203
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:13,603
Good afternoon, ladies.

204
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,698
Could you spare a few pence
for the poor black babies of Africa?

205
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:19,438
- Here you are.
- It's a very good cause.

206
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,404
Thanks, God bless you.
You're very generous.

207
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:25,348
- Give us another pint, please.
- You've had enough.

208
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,908
Listen to you...

209
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:29,216
I'm sick of people telling me what to do.

210
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,447
You just get us another pint.

211
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:34,782
Fine.

212
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:38,329
- Just a few pennies from you, there?
- There you go, Father.

213
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:41,855
Those little orphans,
they really need your charity.

214
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,096
Father...

215
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:48,801
you lot have taken my babies!
You've made my babies orphans.

216
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,179
Fair play to you.

217
00:18:57,383 --> 00:19:00,409
That's a great right cross
you have on you there.

218
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,215
Right, here we are.

219
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:13,127
Quiet! Too much talking.

220
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,027
Just down here, love.

221
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,635
Down you sit.

222
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:22,998
Don't let my teeth fool you. I don't bite.

223
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,902
She's a sweetheart, that Sister Felicity.

224
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,603
It's Frigid Brigid you've got to watch out for.

225
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:33,243
She could put the fear of death
into a corpse, so she could.

226
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,146
I'm Mary.

227
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,320
- I'm Annette.
- I'm Lauren.

228
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,516
I'm Evelyn.

229
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,458
- Your soup doesn't look very good.
- You'll get used to it.

230
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:47,932
You get used to most things here.
Half the kids in Ireland are cooped up here.

231
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,767
How long have you been here for?

232
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,902
- Six months?
- Six years.

233
00:19:56,475 --> 00:20:00,002
I won't be here for long.
My daddy's gonna come and get me.

234
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,043
That's what my dad told me.

235
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,179
I'm sorry, Desmond.

236
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,291
I was the seminary boxing champion.

237
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,351
- Really?
- Let that be a lesson to you.

238
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:19,556
Never underestimate the strength
of the Church militant.

239
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,592
- God bless.
- Thanks, Father.

240
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:28,204
If you want your kids back that badly,
you should get a good lawyer.

241
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:30,708
They cost money.

242
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,341
Go and see Michael Beattie.

243
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:35,174
Twenty-four Upper Mount Street.

244
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,347
- Say I sent you.
- Fair enough.

245
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,477
I'll say the new barmaid at Fergal's Pub
sent me. That'll impress him.

246
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:44,515
Tell him Bernadette sent you,
you cheeky oaf.

247
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:47,455
Bernadette Beattie, his little sister.

248
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:49,994
I'm working here part-time
to help Uncle Fergal.

249
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,757
I'm a trainee chemist, actually.

250
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,958
So, you're the beautiful niece
Fergal's always bragging about.

251
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,827
I bet you have lots of fellows
running after you.

252
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:02,196
Yes. But none of them
have managed to catch me yet.

253
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,975
You're not a bad-looking woman,
now that I look at you.

254
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:09,807
Of course, with this bump on my head,
I'm probably hallucinating.

255
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:18,049
Bless you, John.

256
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,985
Once again,
until we achieve unity and harmony.

257
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:25,087
Where do we say our night prayers?

258
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:26,927
Not in the bed...

259
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,457
not under the bed, but by the bed.

260
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:33,497
Then kneel by your beds and give thanks.

261
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:44,378
Get a move on, Evelyn.
You're keeping us all waiting.

262
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:58,622
We do not lie like that, on our stomach.
It tempts the Devil.

263
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:02,225
We lie on our back
and cross our arms like this.

264
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:05,998
I will check every night
that you are sleeping in this position.

265
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,930
We must not tempt Lucifer.

266
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,940
No more talking. Good night, girls.

267
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:16,504
Good night, Sister.

268
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:22,014
Mr. Doyle, family law in this jurisdiction...

269
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:26,489
is a cozy conspiracy between
the Catholic Church and the Irish State.

270
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,492
They're in cahoots.

271
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:34,999
You're saying that you're all frightened
if you take them on, you'll never work again.

272
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,796
Something like that.

273
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,097
I suggest you come back to me when
your circumstances are more favorable...

274
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,039
and I'll see what I can do.

275
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:48,376
On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down

276
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:52,342
And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune

277
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:57,117
In the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said

278
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:01,056
"Oh, Johnny, lovely Johnny,
why'd you leave me?"

279
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,889
Oh, when I was a young man,
I heard my father say

280
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:12,767
That he'd rather see me dead
and buried in the clay

281
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:16,535
Sooner than be married to any runaway

282
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:20,408
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses

283
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:24,279
On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down

284
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:28,149
And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune

285
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,953
In the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said

286
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:36,859
"Oh, Johnny, lovely Johnny,
why'd you leave me?"

287
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:42,961
"Oh, Lord, I vow never more to offend thee...

288
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:46,435
"and carefully
to avoid the occasions of sin."

289
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,396
...and the meadows they are gay

290
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:52,671
And me and my true love
will sit and sport and play

291
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:58,743
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses

292
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:02,719
On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down

293
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:06,451
And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune

294
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:08,652
In the middle of the tune

295
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:11,252
- Look who's back.
- Straight from Chicago.

296
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,991
How's my favorite Irish colleen?

297
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,295
- I'm well. How are you?
- I'm great.

298
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,612
Who's your man in the sharp suit,
over there?

299
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:31,977
How should I know?

300
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,312
He looks like a Yank.

301
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,787
Maybe he's a friend of hers.
Maybe he's a chemist.

302
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,725
If I can regain your attention for a moment...

303
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,023
we'll have requests.

304
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:47,092
Apart from Nobody's Child.
We're not fond of that now.

305
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,260
- Boys of Wexford.
- Whistling Gypsies.

306
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:57,641
- Are you still not talking to Grandma?
- No, I'll never speak to that woman.

307
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:00,303
She blames your father for everything.

308
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:03,212
May she rot in Hell, the old witch.

309
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,519
Jesus says we should forgive
those who trespassed against us.

310
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:10,054
It's in the "Our Father."

311
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:19,656
- Grandma, would you like a fruit gum?
- Thanks, love.

312
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,066
Granddad gave them to me.

313
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:26,060
I won't bother then, love.

314
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:29,463
Listen, love,
there is something you must tell him.

315
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:34,105
It's really warm.

316
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:37,239
...stuff it, will you?

317
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:38,909
Good girl.

318
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:43,386
Grandma's got a letter from Sydney.

319
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:44,444
Sidney, who?

320
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:46,514
Sydney in Australia.

321
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,789
- Australia?
- It's from Mommy, she's in Australia.

322
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:53,229
She didn't give her address,
but it said Sydney on the postmark thing.

323
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:54,526
I might have guessed.

324
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,262
She always had the wanderlust,
your mother.

325
00:25:57,603 --> 00:26:00,333
- Grandma said it's hot in Australia.
- It is.

326
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,139
You can tell her it's not as hot
as the place where her daughter will end up.

327
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:08,305
Okay.

328
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:12,842
- That's it.
- Still no carriages, Dad.

329
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:14,474
No, son.

330
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:17,187
Still no carriages.

331
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,624
"Dear Daddy, it's great news that you have
such a good job, doing up that old house.

332
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:27,823
"I miss you and the boys
and Granddad very much...

333
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,664
"and I hope we can get back together soon.

334
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:35,434
"What did Granddad mean
when he told me to tell Grandma Daisley...

335
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:38,704
"that he hopes Mommy
meets a great white in Australia?

336
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:42,578
"I think it's a kangaroo,
but Mary thinks it's a koala bear.

337
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:46,616
"I like most of the nuns here.

338
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,710
"Sister Felicity is nice and kind...

339
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,255
"and so is Sister Theresa.

340
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,652
"But Sister Brigid is very scary."

341
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:58,554
Is God good, just and merciful?

342
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:01,092
Yes, Sister.

343
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:04,060
"Yes" isn't the catechism answer, is it?

344
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:07,468
What does the catechism say?

345
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,338
It says...

346
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:14,712
I've had enough of you, Annette Farrell.

347
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:16,405
Now...

348
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:19,179
God is infinitely good...

349
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:21,652
infinitely just...

350
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,347
and infinitely...

351
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:28,888
What are you saying to me, child?

352
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,856
I don't think you should do that, Sister.

353
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:36,326
If God is infinitely merciful,
he wouldn't want you to do that.

354
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,869
You dare to question me about God?

355
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:41,969
Insolent brat!

356
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,537
Right, outside.

357
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,110
Never...

358
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:56,985
never talk to me like that again!

359
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,485
Where's my daughter, Evelyn Doyle?

360
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:38,990
Do you have an appointment?

361
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:41,532
I don't need an appointment
to see my own daughter.

362
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,932
- Who are you?
- I'm Sister Brigid.

363
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:45,397
Are you?

364
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,905
If you ever lay a finger
on my daughter again...

365
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:51,565
I will tear you...

366
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:53,868
limb from limb.

367
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:56,379
Now, where is she?

368
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,409
In the refectory, on the first floor.

369
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,547
Right.

370
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:10,894
- You shouldn't be on the premises.
- I've come for my daughter.

371
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:13,192
- You must leave.
- I'm not leaving without her.

372
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:17,099
- You know that's impossible.
- I'm having her back. Where is she?

373
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,399
You cannot barge in here...

374
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,770
There's no bloody laws in Ireland
that will keep her away from me.

375
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:26,140
How dare you use language like that
in front of me.

376
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:28,441
Don't speak to me like that.
I will not have it.

377
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:32,040
Daddy! Don't fight.
Don't fight with Sister Theresa!

378
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,951
It's all right, love. Don't worry.

379
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,417
Can I see her?

380
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:42,891
Not if you're going to run off with her.

381
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:44,922
That'll just get you arrested.

382
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:47,065
Okay, I promise.

383
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,201
I just wanna hold her for a second.

384
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:54,369
I give you my word, all right?

385
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,644
Evelyn, your daddy's here to see you.

386
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,580
It's good to see you.

387
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:09,245
Daddy, have you come to take me home?

388
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:13,957
Yes.

389
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:17,459
I'll be taking you home soon, pet.

390
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:21,899
Very soon.

391
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:38,009
I hear you're doing well at your new job.

392
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:41,151
My circumstances have improved,
as you would say.

393
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,915
So, you'll take the case, then?

394
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,918
You've been drinking, haven't you?
I can smell it off your breath.

395
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:52,657
Since we're not planning on kissing,
I don't see a problem.

396
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:54,665
It's not going to help our case...

397
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:58,032
if the court thinks
you're drinking your pay packet.

398
00:30:58,303 --> 00:30:59,668
Our case?

399
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:02,432
That means you'll take it, then?

400
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,335
Who is this gobshite?

401
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,970
This "gobshite"
is the Minister for Education.

402
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:12,210
He's claiming we require the consent
of your wife for the release of your kids.

403
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:15,752
How can we get her consent
when she's disappeared?

404
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:19,079
Even her pudding-faced old mother's
got no address.

405
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:22,089
It's the law. Yours is a unique case.

406
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,390
Normally, the wife would be deceased.

407
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:27,795
She ran out on her kids.
What kind of mother would do that?

408
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:32,200
We could argue that she's emotionally
incapable of bringing up the children...

409
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,501
but I'm afraid all of that is,
strictly speaking, irrelevant.

410
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,565
The law still requires her consent...

411
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:40,304
no matter how irresponsibly
she may have behaved.

412
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:42,471
To hell with the law.

413
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:46,049
That attitude will get us nowhere, Desmond.

414
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:50,948
I've done everything I was asked to do.

415
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:55,083
That District Judge or Justice
didn't tell me I'd need my wife's consent.

416
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:59,425
He definitely misdirected you,
which gives us a useful basis for a start.

417
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:01,658
But it may not be material enough...

418
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:05,430
for a challenge in law,
as there are no precedents for your case.

419
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:08,764
We'll make the bloody precedent!
I want justice!

420
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,901
The law and justice
are two entirely different things.

421
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:15,208
Jesus. You can say that again.

422
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:17,775
Of course, I'm only a solicitor.

423
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:20,817
I'm not entitled to speak
in a court case like this.

424
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:23,552
We need a barrister.
And they're very expensive.

425
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:25,613
I don't care how much it costs.

426
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:28,324
I'll work round the clock, if I have to.

427
00:32:29,728 --> 00:32:32,720
To fight Church and State
is to fight Goliath.

428
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:38,862
David beat Goliath, in the book I read.

429
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:46,543
- It's a first edition.
- Is it?

430
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:47,600
Yeats.

431
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,614
It'll be grand, I tell you.
I've got it all worked out, Dad.

432
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:52,650
Don't worry about it.

433
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:01,384
- Get us another pint.
- You'll have another one?

434
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,020
I will.

435
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:06,020
Make mine a large one, Bernadette.
A pint for Desmond.

436
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:08,128
You two are knocking them back tonight.

437
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,690
Poor Dessie's going through
a rough time lately.

438
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,259
Aren't we all fond of a drink?

439
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:16,034
That's right, Henry.
You can't hold that against a man, can you?

440
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:18,608
That lad of yours is going through hell.

441
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,838
- I think he's drinking to forget.
- You're right, Fergal.

442
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:26,441
I wonder if our American friend knows
the one thing worse than drinking to forget.

443
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:30,318
- Do you know what that is, son?
- Worse than drinking to forget? No.

444
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:32,049
Forgetting to drink.

445
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,147
I'll drink to that.

446
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:37,558
That wife of his
didn't know the meaning of the word "love."

447
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:38,721
Love.

448
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:42,130
It's strange. The Greeks
have all these different words for love.

449
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,033
"Philia," "agapi," "eros."
We have just the one.

450
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:47,635
We use the same word
for our nearest and dearest...

451
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:50,072
as we do for a packet of cigarettes.

452
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:53,335
- It's interesting, isn't it?
- I think it's very interesting.

453
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:56,869
Did you know that Eskimos
have over 40 different words for snow?

454
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:59,473
- Is that a fact?
- It's true. The wife told me that.

455
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:01,781
She should know. She's frigid.

456
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:04,248
You're an awful man.

457
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:13,287
- I keep telling you not to drink and drive.
- I'm not drinking and driving.

458
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,398
I drank before I drove.

459
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:20,499
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- It's the only way, Dad.

460
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:22,299
It's the only way.

461
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:45,927
- I can see the dormitory, there.
- We should come back some other time.

462
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:48,830
No. I've got to rescue the poor little mite.

463
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,993
Right, we've come this far.

464
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:54,894
Jesus.

465
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:57,564
They've greased the top of the wall.

466
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,132
Mind yourself, son.

467
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:33,909
Bernadette!

468
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:35,740
You're drenched!

469
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:37,111
That'll be the rain.

470
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:38,813
You're one to talk.

471
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,282
I just...

472
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:43,681
Come in.

473
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,688
- Sit yourself down.
- It's okay. I'm not staying.

474
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:52,059
All right. Suit yourself.

475
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:55,029
I'll get you a towel. A clean one.

476
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:59,195
This place needs a good cleaning.
It's got more empties than Fergal's.

477
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:06,075
Looking for a towel here somewhere. God.

478
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,574
Here we go.

479
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,059
There it is.

480
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:28,062
You can have it, if you want.

481
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:31,233
As a reward
for putting me in touch with your brother.

482
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:33,099
I had no idea you could do this.

483
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:37,039
There's lots of things I can do
that you don't know about.

484
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:38,837
I'm sure there are.

485
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:41,677
We're saving up for a housekeeper.

486
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:44,176
You know anyone who's suitable?

487
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:47,514
It's not a housekeeper you need.
It's a barkeeper.

488
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,013
You know what your problem is?

489
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:53,251
You think all you have to do is smile
with that cheeky twinkle...

490
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:56,088
and everything will be grand.
It's time you grew up.

491
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,561
- You like my cheeky twinkle, then?
- You drink too much!

492
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:02,225
Ridiculous. I've got a lot on my mind.

493
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:06,431
- Like a trip to Scotland with your kids?
- What?

494
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:10,603
How do you know about that?

495
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,836
Because the tickets fell out of your coat.

496
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:16,540
An adult and three kids?
Who could that be, I wonder?

497
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:20,178
I knew you were up to something.
You big idiot.

498
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:22,443
Don't call me a big idiot!

499
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:26,348
I'll bet you want someone smooth,
like the Yank.

500
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:30,516
Whose jokes you laugh at all the time
like he's Oscar bloody Wilde.

501
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:34,361
Nick's funny. And he's more of a ladies' man
than Oscar ever was.

502
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,523
I get the message.

503
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:40,227
You fancy him.

504
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:44,039
Don't tell me who I fancy.
That's for me to decide.

505
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:46,739
What I don't want is a drunkard...

506
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:50,872
who has some mad notion about
sneaking off with his kids to Scotland.

507
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,180
Why should you care?

508
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,778
What business is it of yours?

509
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:02,217
Because I don't want
to have to visit you in prison.

510
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:05,894
Has anybody ever told you
you're a fine woman?

511
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,223
Lots of men.
Some of them weren't even married.

512
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:21,811
- Not until you give me the tickets.
- What?

513
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,916
Give me the ferry tickets.
I'll take them back and get you a refund.

514
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,451
Jesus, woman.

515
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:31,751
You drive a hard bargain. Where are they?

516
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:34,890
Here you go.

517
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:38,120
- Thanks.
- I always get sick on the ferry, anyway.

518
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:44,099
- I just think, you know, you and I...
- Do you really think I'd kiss you now?

519
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:46,102
Lt'd be like kissing a soggy beer-mat.

520
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:49,662
- But you just said...
- No. I said you have to give up the drink.

521
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:52,399
For God's sake.
That's the hardest thing to do.

522
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:55,844
The second hardest.
Getting your family back is the hardest.

523
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:08,081
Oh, of all the money that ever I had

524
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:12,219
I spent it in good company

525
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:17,393
And all the harm that ever I've done

526
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:21,696
Alas it was to none but me

527
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:27,007
And if I had money enough to spend

528
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:30,878
And leisure time to sit awhile

529
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:35,684
There is a fair maid in this town

530
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:40,686
Who sorely has my heart beguiled

531
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:45,822
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips

532
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:50,595
I own she has my heart in thrall

533
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,668
So, fill to me the parting glass

534
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:01,744
Good night and joy be with you all

535
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,945
Good man, Des.

536
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:14,752
Lovely. Good man.

537
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,726
Thank you very much, everyone.

538
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:22,955
You've been wonderful. God bless you all.
We hope to see you again next week.

539
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,127
Okay. God bless. Good night.

540
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:29,667
Come on.

541
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:31,103
You all right?

542
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:33,143
Dessie, I...

543
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:36,874
Look at me. Are you okay? Dad, come on.

544
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:39,541
Jesus!

545
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:41,985
Dad. Someone get a doctor.

546
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,453
Here, Johnny!
Go and run for a doctor, quick!

547
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:45,784
I'm here.

548
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:48,517
- Dessie.
- I'm here, Dad.

549
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:51,562
- The kids.
- We'll get them back.

550
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:53,062
You and I, together.

551
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:57,362
Dad.

552
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,766
Henry, it's Father O'Malley.

553
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:08,004
If you can hear me,
say the Act of Contrition.

554
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:29,324
Amen.

555
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:47,578
Look, angel rays.

556
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:52,179
What's angel rays, love?

557
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:55,157
It's Granddad letting us know
he's watching over us.

558
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,961
He's our guardian angel.

559
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:02,225
He told me all about angel rays.

560
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:06,859
Good old Dad.

561
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,573
I knew he wouldn't leave us.

562
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:27,788
- Good morning, Miss Gilhooly.
- Mr. Doyle.

563
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:30,293
- Didn't you get the letter?
- What letter?

564
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,419
The one canceling this appointment.

565
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,390
I didn't get any letter.

566
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,226
I've taken this morning
especially off work to see him.

567
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:40,702
This is my family we're talking about.
Where is he?

568
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:01,985
Jesus.

569
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:23,576
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

570
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,103
Lilo! Higgi! Come on!

571
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:52,609
Sorry, sir. It's a trespasser.

572
00:43:52,677 --> 00:43:55,168
It's all right. This is a client of mine.

573
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:57,304
- A client, sir?
- Yes!

574
00:43:58,215 --> 00:43:59,842
We have an appointment!

575
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:04,247
Please let us know in the future, sir,
if you're expecting visitors.

576
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:11,825
What the hell are you smirking at?
Do you think this is funny?

577
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,095
Do you think you can cancel appointments
and treat people like dirt?

578
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,658
- Mr. Doyle...
- I wasn't talking to you, Yank.

579
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:22,238
All you're good for's wearing sharp suits,
doing fancy deals...

580
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:24,171
and trying to get hands on our women.

581
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:26,835
- And our fish!
- Desmond, be reasonable.

582
00:44:27,244 --> 00:44:29,109
I'm sorry I missed our appointment...

583
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,445
but there's really nothing more
I can do for you anymore.

584
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:33,776
Really?

585
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:37,678
Your being sorry
isn't gonna get my kids back, now, is it?

586
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:41,186
I'm sure the Yank here is having great fun...

587
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:45,223
seeing what a lot of bloody spineless
jellyfish we've got over here.

588
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:48,154
But ask yourself this, Mr. Big Shot.

589
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,326
What if it was your family?

590
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,471
Wouldn't you fight tooth and nail
to get them back?

591
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:58,337
Or are you just another
heartless, gutless bastard?

592
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:41,809
Congratulations.
You just found yourself a lawyer.

593
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:43,381
Is that a fact?

594
00:45:44,455 --> 00:45:45,513
Who?

595
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:46,980
Me.

596
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,216
So, you're not a chemist, then?

597
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:53,423
How come you can work over here
if you're a Yank?

598
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:55,692
Actually, I'm Irish.

599
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,963
I was born and reared in Kilkenny
till I was 9.

600
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,668
Then we emigrated to the States
and I subsequently came back here...

601
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,264
to study law at UCD.

602
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:06,866
So, he's qualified to plead in Irish courts.

603
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:09,974
Does my being a Yank bother you?

604
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:12,376
Not at all. I like Yanks.

605
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,680
Most of them were Irish
to begin with, anyway.

606
00:46:15,753 --> 00:46:19,052
But I can't afford to pay you fancy money.

607
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:22,048
I'm not doing this for the money.

608
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:25,161
You'll just have to raise enough
to cover our costs.

609
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:27,824
Right.

610
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:31,858
I really appreciate your help, so I do.

611
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:34,628
We'll do our best for you.

612
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,468
- Right. Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

613
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:44,847
- We'll do our best?
- We're in this together, my friend.

614
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:47,713
Do you think I'll take this on
with any other solicitor?

615
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:50,720
We have no chance.
I don't know why you're taking it on.

616
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:54,781
Because I know what he's going through,
through no one's fault but my own.

617
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:57,157
I lost my own kids in that divorce.

618
00:46:57,228 --> 00:47:01,324
- You don't realize what we're up against.
- I do realize what we're up against.

619
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,891
What possible chance
do you think you have?

620
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,460
You and Mr...

621
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:10,230
- Mr. Doyle.
- Mr. Doyle, here.

622
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,370
A painter and what? Decorator?

623
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,413
Master tradesman, to you.

624
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:20,909
Apart from anything else,
it will be prohibitively expensive.

625
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:22,475
Only if we lose.

626
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:25,152
- You'll lose, Mr...
- Beattie.

627
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:29,886
You'll lose, because
if you were to win this case...

628
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,157
the whole basis of family law
would be undermined.

629
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,294
And believe me, gentlemen,
that will not be allowed to happen.

630
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,893
We thank you for your advice, Mr...

631
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:41,933
Shall we?

632
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:52,082
By the way, Minister...

633
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:55,317
your paintwork's shite.

634
00:47:56,987 --> 00:48:00,923
What we really need
is an expert in family law to keep us right.

635
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:03,186
- You know?
- I thought you were an expert.

636
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:07,592
I haven't done family law in 20 years.
I've only a working knowledge.

637
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:12,463
You mean you don't know what you're
talking about? Can't you read some books?

638
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:16,097
It's not quite as simple as that.
It's a very tricky area.

639
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:20,735
We've still got the problem that everyone's
terrified of taking on the Establishment.

640
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:24,679
What was the name of that guy
that lectured us about family law?

641
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:27,080
- Remember? The real character.
- Tom Connolly.

642
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:30,882
There was a Connolly who played rugby
for Ireland until his cartilage went.

643
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:33,981
I think he did a bit of law in his spare time.
Would that be him?

644
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:39,763
Gentlemen, I'm flattered by your attentions,
but I retired two years ago.

645
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:44,126
In short, I can no longer face
speaking in court.

646
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:48,968
Sir, you wouldn't have to speak in court.
Mr. Barron here will do all the speaking.

647
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:52,003
But frankly, sir, he needs your help.

648
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:54,601
My family law is so rusty.

649
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,276
Even if you could just come on board
as a consultant.

650
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:02,274
I'm sorry to say this to you, Mr. Doyle.

651
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:08,087
But they'll put forward the best people
to put the case for the State.

652
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:11,354
The best that money can buy.

653
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:13,760
That's why they hated me.

654
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:15,755
I wouldn't be bought.

655
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:20,292
I believe that if there is a God,
He'll step in to help us.

656
00:49:23,107 --> 00:49:25,132
I'm touched by your faith.

657
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:31,840
This is the only Holy Spirit
I've found to be of any practical assistance.

658
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:34,479
Sláinte.

659
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:43,383
You were a big hero to me as a boy,
Mr. Connolly.

660
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:45,694
To my dad, too.

661
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:48,994
He took me to all your games.
You see that photo there?

662
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:52,527
I was at that game.
The one where you got injured.

663
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,063
That was the beginning of the end.

664
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:58,366
When that big brute of a fullback
did my cartilage in.

665
00:49:58,442 --> 00:50:01,138
He was English, of course. The bastard.

666
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:04,109
Still, before I left the field...

667
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:07,446
I managed to boot him where his balls
would have been, if he'd any.

668
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:08,917
Fair play to you.

669
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:11,010
Anyway, lads...

670
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:14,115
your case is interesting.

671
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,586
Hopeless, but interesting.

672
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:19,852
You really think it's hopeless?

673
00:50:20,064 --> 00:50:22,965
This case is what I used to call
"a real St. Jude."

674
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:24,557
Why St. Jude?

675
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:28,469
Because St. Jude
is the patron saint of hopeless cases.

676
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,838
As I recall, sir, you've won
quite a few St. Judes in your time.

677
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:38,941
I suppose I have.

678
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,914
Retirement must be excruciatingly boring
for a man like yourself.

679
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:01,703
Gentlemen...

680
00:51:03,273 --> 00:51:04,934
I propose a toast.

681
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:08,340
Justice and St. Jude.

682
00:51:13,317 --> 00:51:14,648
I am Desmond Doyle...

683
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,319
father of Evelyn Doyle, who's been held
in your care without my consent.

684
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,823
I request the return
of my daughter, forthwith.

685
00:51:23,394 --> 00:51:25,885
Mr. Doyle, you cannot have your daughter.

686
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:31,030
In that case, my solicitor,
Mr. Michael Beattie...

687
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:33,626
will present you
with a writ of habeas corpus...

688
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:36,867
drafted by my counselor,
Mr. Nicholas Barron.

689
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:39,933
Duly presented.

690
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:42,042
Duly witnessed.

691
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:45,047
Thank you, Sister. That's all we need.

692
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:54,785
- So, it went well, then?
- It went like a dream.

693
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:57,986
Desmond remembered all his lines,
and spoke them beautifully.

694
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,188
Laurence Olivier had better watch out.

695
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:02,926
- You didn't attack a nun, then?
- I did not.

696
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,230
I'm learning the rules of the game.

697
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:07,566
- What do we do now?
- We wait.

698
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:10,835
No. That's just what they want us to do.

699
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:15,240
They'll do nothing for months
and hope that we'll go away.

700
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:19,082
Nothing will happen
unless we force their hand.

701
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,614
I'll give my old friend Hugh Canning a ring.

702
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:23,812
Hugh Canning?

703
00:52:23,887 --> 00:52:26,822
- But he's a sports commentator.
- Mostly, yes.

704
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,584
But he does a bit of everything.

705
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:41,127
May God grant you justice.

706
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,932
- Take this and run along, girl.
- Thank you, Sister.

707
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,013
What is it?

708
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:56,718
- Eileen, come here.
- What's going on?

709
00:52:56,787 --> 00:53:00,917
"Desmond Doyle, a painter and decorator
from Fatima Mansions, Dublin...

710
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:04,586
"is a loving father who just wants
to spend time with his children...

711
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,095
"but the powers that be won't let him.

712
00:53:07,264 --> 00:53:10,165
"Desmond's rosy-cheeked
little daughter, Evelyn..."

713
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:18,669
At least they've set a date for the hearing.
That's the first step.

714
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:21,267
A little bit of gentle pressure did the trick.

715
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:24,246
We had to give the Minister
a kick up his fat ass.

716
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:26,405
What do we do now?

717
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:30,416
You should smarten yourself up.
The press might want photos of you.

718
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,747
Try combing your hair, occasionally.

719
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:35,185
Shave.

720
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:40,455
Look as if you haven't just fallen out of bed.
Use me as a role model if you want to.

721
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:43,364
And buy a new pair of shoes
before we get to court.

722
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:45,334
- New shoes?
- Yes.

723
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:49,429
I've known judges who judge a man's
character by the state of his shoes.

724
00:53:57,147 --> 00:54:00,742
- Here they come. Let's get a shot.
- Especially of the little girl.

725
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:03,718
- Come on.
- Get the three of them together, now.

726
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:08,288
- Daddy, I scored a goal in Gaelic!
- Daddy.

727
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:12,089
My loves! You look wonderful.

728
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:15,865
- Daddy, I like your new shoes.
- Thanks, Evelyn.

729
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:22,038
Ferris hasn't changed much since I knew
him. The torn-faced old poultice.

730
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:25,798
He's always looked like the Turin Shroud.

731
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:28,975
We used to call him "Ferris the Ferret."

732
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:31,372
Which is an insult to the rodent.

733
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:35,507
Mr. Barron, you're representing
the petitioner, Desmond Doyle?

734
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:37,247
Yes, my lord.

735
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:42,215
We contend the judge at the District Court
hearing of January 10 of this year...

736
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:45,284
misdirected the petitioner,
Mr. Desmond Doyle.

737
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:50,560
I refer you to the notes of that case
wherein the judge expressed his hope...

738
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:54,900
that Mr. Doyle would not have to leave
his children in care for too long.

739
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:57,701
Sadly, that has not been the case here.

740
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:03,374
The Children's Act of 1941 clearly states...

741
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:07,611
that unless the spouse is deceased,
which is not the case here...

742
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:11,182
then the consent
of both parents is required.

743
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:15,521
This is the basis of our case, Your Lordship.

744
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:19,754
Provision of the Children's Act...

745
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:23,322
must be understood in its literal,
grammatical meaning.

746
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:26,897
"Both parents" means exactly that.

747
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:31,165
I therefore find against the petitioner,
Desmond Doyle.

748
00:55:32,676 --> 00:55:34,541
Thank you, Judge Hall.

749
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:36,177
Judge McLaughlin?

750
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:40,214
With some reluctance,
I conclude that I, too, must find against...

751
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:44,247
the petitioner's application
and uphold the Minister's decision.

752
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:49,249
- We've lost.
- That's absolutely ridiculous!

753
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,823
- Order in court!
- You rotten louses. Let his babies go home.

754
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:55,490
Silence, or I shall have the court cleared.

755
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:59,763
- Silence in court!
- He's loving this. The rodent.

756
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:05,404
It is incontrovertible...

757
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:10,037
that Section 10,
Subsection 1 of the Children's Act, 1941...

758
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,272
requires the consent of both parents.

759
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:17,445
In the absence of such consent,
Evelyn Doyle and her brothers...

760
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:21,287
will remain in custody
until they are 16 years of age.

761
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:22,414
Daddy!

762
00:56:22,592 --> 00:56:24,992
Furthermore, this court has decided...

763
00:56:25,062 --> 00:56:29,499
that since the Children's Act
is capable of no other interpretation...

764
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:32,998
any appeal
would be a waste of the court's time.

765
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:36,470
Right of appeal is therefore denied.

766
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:40,038
- No, you flea-faced rat!
- Who said that?

767
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:45,675
Was that you, Connolly?

768
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:53,426
This is Hugh Canning,
the man who broke the Doyle story...

769
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:56,098
covering this sensational new development.

770
00:56:56,174 --> 00:56:57,539
Leave them alone.

771
00:56:57,609 --> 00:56:59,201
Get your hands off my kids!

772
00:56:59,911 --> 00:57:02,106
- Leave me alone!
- Daddy!

773
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,042
Unbelievable scenes here at the High Court.

774
00:57:05,116 --> 00:57:07,482
I've never seen anything like it.

775
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:11,648
Desmond Doyle struggles with the gardai
for possession of his children.

776
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,215
A pitiful scene to watch.

777
00:57:14,325 --> 00:57:18,056
And who wouldn't sympathize with a father
in this situation?

778
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:19,621
Daddy!

779
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:21,490
Children!

780
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:23,623
Daddy, please!

781
00:57:59,337 --> 00:58:01,202
Is Desmond Doyle here?

782
00:58:01,406 --> 00:58:03,704
He's sitting over there, in the booth.

783
00:58:08,513 --> 00:58:10,413
Sorry to interrupt you.

784
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:14,115
I'm Honest Joe O'Leary, racecourse bookie.

785
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:19,382
I owned the book
on the outcome of your court case.

786
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:22,252
- The punters backed you heavy.
- Great.

787
00:58:22,327 --> 00:58:24,852
I didn't feel right in keeping this...

788
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,828
so I want you to have it.

789
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:33,930
Jesus.

790
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:35,764
My God.

791
00:58:36,407 --> 00:58:40,867
It's only $600, so I thought
it might go towards your court costs.

792
00:58:44,415 --> 00:58:46,713
I don't know what to say, Mr. O'Leary.

793
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:50,652
You don't have to say anything, Mr. Doyle.
You see, I grew up in an orphanage.

794
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:53,416
I wish my dad had your guts.

795
00:58:54,058 --> 00:58:56,288
Good luck to you. Good night, all.

796
00:58:56,794 --> 00:58:58,125
Good night.

797
00:58:59,197 --> 00:59:02,030
We're organizing a race next month.

798
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,892
- The Desmond Doyle Benefit Sweepstake.
- Great.

799
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:10,465
- Put your money on Slippery Sam.
- Slippery Sam.

800
00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:14,607
Grand man. Good night, now. God bless.

801
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,875
This calls for a celebration.
Another round for the table.

802
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:21,611
Make mine a lemonade.

803
00:59:21,753 --> 00:59:24,244
What? A lemonade? Are you all right, son?

804
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:26,580
No, I'm feeling terrible.

805
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:30,651
But maybe it's time I tried to feel better.

806
00:59:31,729 --> 00:59:32,718
Jerry.

807
00:59:38,536 --> 00:59:40,595
Keep your eye on the ball, son.

808
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:45,175
Dig it out.

809
00:59:45,376 --> 00:59:47,139
- Dig it out.
- Thomas!

810
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:55,248
- Good reflexes, you'll need them.
- Back in the Irish strip, I see.

811
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,747
It helps me to see things more clearly.
Did you play rugby yourself, Nick?

812
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:04,022
No, I understand it's kind of
a Neanderthal version of American football.

813
01:00:04,095 --> 01:00:05,722
Is that what you think?

814
01:00:05,797 --> 01:00:07,025
Hut, hut.

815
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:13,365
Hopeless.

816
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:15,605
So, anyway...

817
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:19,442
why have I invited you to this sacred turf?

818
01:00:19,844 --> 01:00:22,312
- I was kind of wondering that.
- So was I.

819
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,679
Me, too. It's not exactly
how I planned to spend my morning.

820
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,012
You know...

821
01:00:28,953 --> 01:00:33,390
when my cartilage went
and they were taking me off on a stretcher...

822
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,222
I looked up and I saw this father...

823
01:00:37,061 --> 01:00:40,053
holding his little child up on his shoulders.

824
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:44,195
They thought I was a hero,
but you know something?

825
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:48,170
I envied that man so much. He was my hero.

826
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:54,205
All Desmond wants
is to hold his kids up on his shoulders.

827
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:56,707
We can help you to that.

828
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:59,807
But how, Tom? There is no right of appeal.

829
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,408
Ferris made sure of that.

830
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:03,283
We don't need an appeal.

831
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:05,920
Not if we bring an entirely new case...

832
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,084
based on an entirely different
principle of law.

833
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,254
But we're automatically barred
from bringing the same facts...

834
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:15,060
before the same court
that's already heard them.

835
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:18,466
Be it the District Courts or High Courts,
we've nowhere else to go.

836
01:01:18,536 --> 01:01:20,629
There is somewhere else to go.

837
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:22,395
The Supreme Court.

838
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,501
The Supreme Court?

839
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:27,436
We can't go there with this.

840
01:01:27,612 --> 01:01:30,775
They won't hear a case like this.
They only deal with big stuff.

841
01:01:30,848 --> 01:01:31,837
Yes.

842
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:36,075
Like laws that contravene
the Irish Constitution...

843
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:38,750
which I've been reading.

844
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,060
Wait a second. Hold on.

845
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:48,121
Has anyone ever successfully
challenged the law on these grounds?

846
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,224
No.

847
01:01:54,939 --> 01:01:58,033
- What chance do you think we've got?
- Who knows?

848
01:01:58,242 --> 01:02:02,770
But I've seen games won by teams
without any hope at all.

849
01:02:07,051 --> 01:02:08,416
Bloody hopeless.

850
01:02:10,054 --> 01:02:13,353
Good evening,
and welcome to the very first edition...

851
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:15,591
of Conversations With Canning...

852
01:02:15,693 --> 01:02:18,526
on this marvelous new medium
of the television.

853
01:02:20,097 --> 01:02:23,294
For those of you who listen to my show
on the wireless...

854
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:26,461
I hope I'm even better looking
than you thought.

855
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,668
Now, many of you...

856
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:35,367
will remember these sad headlines
of last month:

857
01:02:35,913 --> 01:02:37,676
"Desmond's Despair."

858
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:41,748
Desmond certainly isn't despairing
at the moment.

859
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,413
In fact, he's sitting here,
right beside me...

860
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:47,252
in our ultramodern television studio.

861
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:51,661
And he's got new reasons for being hopeful,
haven't you Desmond?

862
01:02:51,729 --> 01:02:52,855
Yes!

863
01:02:53,698 --> 01:02:57,634
It's okay. You don't have to shout,
we can hear you fine.

864
01:02:58,236 --> 01:02:59,464
Fair enough.

865
01:02:59,537 --> 01:03:02,335
Doesn't he look handsome
when he smartens himself up?

866
01:03:02,406 --> 01:03:05,534
He's learning. I've always told him
he should model himself on me.

867
01:03:05,743 --> 01:03:10,043
...that your daughter Evelyn
and your two boys are being held illegally.

868
01:03:10,481 --> 01:03:11,539
Yes.

869
01:03:12,817 --> 01:03:17,117
And you'll be taking on
some pretty top people?

870
01:03:17,321 --> 01:03:20,848
Yeah. We're gonna call
the Minister of Education as a witness.

871
01:03:22,026 --> 01:03:26,224
And I've often asked myself,
"What drives Desmond Doyle?"

872
01:03:26,864 --> 01:03:29,492
- Desmond?
- I love my children.

873
01:03:31,002 --> 01:03:33,732
I'm sick of saying goodbye to them
all the time.

874
01:03:33,804 --> 01:03:37,240
I just don't want them
to spend their whole childhood crying.

875
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:40,174
- Has a date been set for the trial?
- Not yet.

876
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:42,872
But I want my kiddies home for Christmas.

877
01:03:44,382 --> 01:03:46,111
Home for Christmas.

878
01:03:47,151 --> 01:03:50,052
That's an inspiring note on which to end...

879
01:03:50,154 --> 01:03:53,146
this little conversation with Canning.

880
01:03:53,224 --> 01:03:54,452
Holy Jesus.

881
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:57,391
This thing will never catch on.

882
01:03:57,762 --> 01:04:00,492
...and we'll be following your case closely.

883
01:04:01,165 --> 01:04:02,291
And now...

884
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:05,733
the beautiful strains of the Irish harp.

885
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:12,771
Some good news, some bad news.

886
01:04:13,044 --> 01:04:15,410
First, the good news. They've set a date.

887
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:17,845
- Second week in December.
- Great.

888
01:04:18,783 --> 01:04:21,013
It's a great time to have a trial.

889
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:25,416
- Even judges are sentimental at Christmas.
- Not all of them, I'm afraid.

890
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:27,514
Guess who we've got again.

891
01:04:27,658 --> 01:04:29,387
- Ferris the Ferret?
- Yes.

892
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,157
He's been elevated
to the Supreme Court, apparently.

893
01:04:33,364 --> 01:04:35,059
Lousy luck.

894
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:37,763
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

895
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:42,606
If you ask me, the State's planted him there
in an attempt to scupper us.

896
01:04:45,376 --> 01:04:47,970
Come on, eat up, there's plenty more.

897
01:04:49,413 --> 01:04:51,881
Here, have a nice big fat sausage.

898
01:04:52,717 --> 01:04:56,312
We're gonna make you lovely and lazy.
Might slow you up a bit.

899
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:02,492
Sorry, Sam, nothing for you.
You're gonna get your feast after the race.

900
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:07,854
They're off, and it's a close-packed field
at the start now.

901
01:05:07,932 --> 01:05:09,627
Come on!

902
01:05:13,604 --> 01:05:15,094
Stay up there, my boy.

903
01:05:15,272 --> 01:05:16,967
Stay up. Yes!

904
01:05:17,074 --> 01:05:20,475
They're battling it out, neck and neck.
Slippery Sam's edged in front.

905
01:05:20,544 --> 01:05:22,637
And as they come around the bend...

906
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:25,011
Slippery Sam putting on
a tremendous effort.

907
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:45,131
O'Leary, how did you know?

908
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,830
Let's say I knew he was hungry for a win.

909
01:05:47,905 --> 01:05:49,634
- Good man.
- Desmond?

910
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,305
The readers of the Irish Times
have voted you the Man of the Year.

911
01:05:53,377 --> 01:05:56,608
- How do you feel about that?
- I'm honored. Who was second?

912
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,807
- The Pope.
- Fair play to him.

913
01:05:58,883 --> 01:06:00,350
Come on, Bernadette.

914
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:03,683
- Let's go and collect our winnings.
- Right you are.

915
01:06:03,921 --> 01:06:06,412
Desmond, I've got a few bob, myself.

916
01:06:07,191 --> 01:06:10,183
- How's it going with Bernadette, then?
- Great.

917
01:06:10,528 --> 01:06:15,124
In fact, I asked her to come back
to America with me, when the case is over.

918
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:16,798
Really?

919
01:06:17,234 --> 01:06:18,826
What did she say?

920
01:06:18,903 --> 01:06:21,133
She said she'd think about it.

921
01:06:24,475 --> 01:06:26,500
I asked her to move in with me.

922
01:06:26,877 --> 01:06:28,367
- Really?
- Yeah.

923
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:29,708
What did she say?

924
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,839
She said she'd think about it.

925
01:06:36,153 --> 01:06:39,884
- Who knows what she'll do.
- Fatima Mansions versus the USA.

926
01:06:41,225 --> 01:06:42,692
Tough choice.

927
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:50,633
Sister, why don't you cut my hair?

928
01:06:50,701 --> 01:06:52,328
You've cut everybody else's.

929
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:56,271
Because they are not likely
to have their photos all over the newspaper.

930
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,137
Why should that make a difference?

931
01:06:58,209 --> 01:07:02,578
I don't think that I should be treated special
just because my daddy's getting famous.

932
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:05,615
But didn't your daddy tell us
not to cut your hair?

933
01:07:05,683 --> 01:07:08,675
Yes, and didn't he tell you
to let me go home?

934
01:07:08,786 --> 01:07:10,981
You didn't take a blind bit of notice.

935
01:07:11,422 --> 01:07:12,411
Look...

936
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:16,526
If I were to cut your hair,
Sister Theresa would not be amused.

937
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:19,160
I'll explain to my daddy if he gets cross.

938
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:22,461
And who will explain it to Sister Theresa
if she gets cross?

939
01:07:22,566 --> 01:07:23,965
You, Sister.

940
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:28,705
Hugh Canning reporting to you, live,
from outside the Supreme Court...

941
01:07:28,973 --> 01:07:32,306
on the first day of this historic case.

942
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:36,012
A grand, official car has just arrived.

943
01:07:36,213 --> 01:07:38,841
It's the Minister of Education.

944
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:41,976
Looks as if he'd rather be
somewhere else, this day.

945
01:07:43,153 --> 01:07:46,281
This must be what soldiers feel like
just before battle.

946
01:07:47,057 --> 01:07:48,752
- Nervous?
- Nervous?

947
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,453
I'm only trying to make legal history...

948
01:07:51,529 --> 01:07:55,863
by doing something that's never been
done before, and if I fail, I'm unemployable.

949
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:58,697
But if you win, son, you're immortal.

950
01:07:59,003 --> 01:08:01,130
You're in the history books.

951
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:05,597
And you'll help take this country
out of the Dark Ages.

952
01:08:08,379 --> 01:08:11,371
Rosary beads.
I thought you weren't religious.

953
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:13,940
I'm not.

954
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,250
When the verdict comes in,
these are for counting the score.

955
01:08:20,858 --> 01:08:23,520
Remember, Nick, speak from your heart.

956
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:27,956
I'll sit up in the gallery,
out of the Ferret's eye-line.

957
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:29,531
Thanks, Tom.

958
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,130
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks for everything.

959
01:08:34,605 --> 01:08:35,765
Right.

960
01:08:40,044 --> 01:08:42,012
Let the battle commence.

961
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,041
- Is this all right?
- It's fine.

962
01:08:46,717 --> 01:08:49,515
Minister, three times now
you have refused...

963
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:53,079
to reconsider the case of Desmond Doyle.
Is that correct?

964
01:08:53,357 --> 01:08:56,952
It is. A decision subsequently upheld
by the High Court.

965
01:08:57,861 --> 01:09:02,491
Yes, but the grounds for our action now
are fundamentally different, is that not so?

966
01:09:03,934 --> 01:09:05,629
I suppose it is.

967
01:09:05,703 --> 01:09:10,663
Could you tell us, Minister, to whom or
to what do you owe your eminent position?

968
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:12,367
Pardon?

969
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:14,308
Your job, sir. Who appointed you?

970
01:09:14,378 --> 01:09:18,439
Objection, Your Lordship.
This is irrelevant, not to say insolent.

971
01:09:18,716 --> 01:09:19,705
My lord...

972
01:09:19,783 --> 01:09:24,243
counsel for the plaintiff
has indeed failed to establish relevance.

973
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:27,048
I am about to do so, Your Lordship.

974
01:09:27,124 --> 01:09:29,251
I hope so, Mr. Barron. Proceed.

975
01:09:31,128 --> 01:09:35,394
As Minister for Education, you are
a government appointee, are you not?

976
01:09:35,599 --> 01:09:36,896
Of course I am.

977
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:40,130
What is the document on which
the Irish government's authority...

978
01:09:40,204 --> 01:09:42,832
and therefore your authority, rests?

979
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,741
The Irish Constitution.

980
01:09:46,143 --> 01:09:48,634
Have you read it recently?

981
01:09:48,712 --> 01:09:51,044
Objection, Your Lordship.
This is insufferable!

982
01:09:51,115 --> 01:09:55,074
Counsel for the plaintiff is not displaying
due deference to the witness, my lord.

983
01:09:55,152 --> 01:09:56,915
Objection sustained.

984
01:09:57,054 --> 01:10:00,421
Be careful, Mr. Barron.
The witness must be treated with respect.

985
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:01,753
Yes, my lord.

986
01:10:03,293 --> 01:10:06,160
I would be grateful
if you could read out to the Court...

987
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:09,165
those short extracts
from the Irish Constitution...

988
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:13,064
which, we have established,
is the basis for your authority.

989
01:10:15,706 --> 01:10:16,934
"Article 1.

990
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:21,034
"The Irish Constitution shall be consistent
with the law of God.

991
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,177
"Article 41.

992
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:28,376
"A parent and child have a fundamental
and God-given right...

993
01:10:28,452 --> 01:10:31,546
"to the enjoyment of each other's
mutual society.

994
01:10:34,358 --> 01:10:35,882
"Article 42.

995
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:39,861
"A blameless parent shall not be deprived
of his or her right...

996
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,057
"to direct the child's education."

997
01:10:42,132 --> 01:10:44,692
Is it fair to say
that by consistently rejecting...

998
01:10:44,768 --> 01:10:47,635
Desmond Doyle's application
for the return of his children...

999
01:10:47,705 --> 01:10:52,608
you have denied him
that fundamental and God-given right?

1000
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:55,806
Would it be fair to say that, Minister?

1001
01:10:58,682 --> 01:11:01,082
We are waiting for your response.

1002
01:11:01,852 --> 01:11:04,082
That is a possibility.

1003
01:11:04,621 --> 01:11:05,645
Yes.

1004
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:07,486
And is it also a possibility...

1005
01:11:07,558 --> 01:11:11,085
that you have contravened
Article 42 of the Constitution...

1006
01:11:11,161 --> 01:11:15,928
by denying Desmond Doyle
the right to direct his children's education?

1007
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:18,225
Yes.

1008
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:20,964
That is also a possibility.

1009
01:11:22,372 --> 01:11:25,569
- That is what we are here to determine.
- Exactly.

1010
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:28,974
And we will so determine.

1011
01:11:29,046 --> 01:11:30,638
Good boy.

1012
01:11:30,914 --> 01:11:32,677
No further questions.

1013
01:11:32,783 --> 01:11:34,045
Well done.

1014
01:11:36,353 --> 01:11:38,344
Article 42 of the Constitution...

1015
01:11:38,422 --> 01:11:41,016
refers to a blameless parent.

1016
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:45,592
And we contend that this concept
is tacit also in Article 41.

1017
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:48,361
That it is the blameless parent...

1018
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:52,562
who has a fundamental, God-given right
to his children's society.

1019
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:54,571
This...

1020
01:11:54,638 --> 01:11:57,038
does not apply to Desmond Doyle.

1021
01:11:59,877 --> 01:12:02,903
He came barging in, unannounced,
to the main building.

1022
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:05,346
He was in a terrible rage...

1023
01:12:05,749 --> 01:12:07,910
and he looked like a man
possessed by the Devil.

1024
01:12:07,985 --> 01:12:12,149
Objection. Your Lordship,
the witness is demonizing my client.

1025
01:12:12,222 --> 01:12:16,090
Not so, my lord. The Sister
is merely expressing herself vividly...

1026
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,652
using a figure of speech
appropriate to her occupation.

1027
01:12:20,097 --> 01:12:22,691
Objection overruled. Proceed, Sister.

1028
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,425
He was like a man possessed.

1029
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:28,036
He shouted at me, "Where is my daughter?"

1030
01:12:28,105 --> 01:12:31,632
- He yelled at the top of his voice.
- And what did you say to him, Sister?

1031
01:12:31,742 --> 01:12:35,508
- I asked him if he had an appointment.
- And what did he say?

1032
01:12:35,979 --> 01:12:39,540
He grabbed me by the throat
and almost choked the life out of me.

1033
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:41,481
Throttling me, he was.

1034
01:12:41,985 --> 01:12:44,453
He said if I didn't tell him
where his daughter was...

1035
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:48,116
he would tear me limb from limb.
Those were his exact words.

1036
01:12:48,192 --> 01:12:52,526
- I thought he was going to murder me.
- And what did he do then, Sister?

1037
01:12:53,497 --> 01:12:56,489
I told him where the girl was
and he ran upstairs...

1038
01:12:56,567 --> 01:12:59,035
repeating his threats as he did so.

1039
01:12:59,169 --> 01:13:02,104
My neck was black and blue
from where his thumbs had been.

1040
01:13:02,172 --> 01:13:04,936
Did you report
this deplorable incident to anyone?

1041
01:13:05,008 --> 01:13:07,806
Yes, I phoned the police.
They will confirm every word.

1042
01:13:07,878 --> 01:13:12,281
Sister Theresa decided, out of the charity
of her heart, not to press charges.

1043
01:13:12,349 --> 01:13:14,579
No further questions, my lord.

1044
01:13:16,954 --> 01:13:18,922
Have I messed it up for us all, then?

1045
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:20,752
You may have.

1046
01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:24,391
We're just gonna have to show
that this was an isolated incident...

1047
01:13:24,461 --> 01:13:26,952
not part of a pattern of behavior.

1048
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:30,591
- I hope that was the only such incident?
- Of course it was.

1049
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:33,830
Apart from the time you tried to punch
Father O'Malley at Fergal's.

1050
01:13:33,904 --> 01:13:34,928
That.

1051
01:13:35,005 --> 01:13:39,169
- And when you tried to kidnap your kids.
- Yes, but I was drunk on both occasions.

1052
01:13:39,243 --> 01:13:42,838
For God's sake, don't try to use
drunkenness as a defense.

1053
01:13:42,913 --> 01:13:44,778
It doesn't impress them.

1054
01:13:44,848 --> 01:13:48,579
Haven't you heard the phrase,
"As sober as a judge"?

1055
01:13:53,123 --> 01:13:54,886
So, you see, Your Lordship...

1056
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:59,554
I only shook Sister Brigid when
I found out she'd beaten up my little girl.

1057
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:02,190
- I object, Your Lordship.
- Not as much as I object.

1058
01:14:02,266 --> 01:14:04,734
I object to anyone laying a finger
on my kids.

1059
01:14:04,801 --> 01:14:06,701
Objection upheld.

1060
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:09,898
That's Mr. Wolfe's objection,
not yours, Mr. Doyle.

1061
01:14:09,973 --> 01:14:11,998
Continue with your testimony.

1062
01:14:12,442 --> 01:14:14,876
Wouldn't any father have done what I did?

1063
01:14:15,178 --> 01:14:17,908
Evelyn's face was all battered and bruised.

1064
01:14:19,349 --> 01:14:21,010
Silence in court.

1065
01:14:24,421 --> 01:14:27,390
Even as a very dubious kind of Catholic...

1066
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:30,119
who finds himself throttling a nun...

1067
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,228
you must know that the fundamental
building block of our society...

1068
01:14:34,298 --> 01:14:35,492
is the family...

1069
01:14:35,565 --> 01:14:38,432
whose very model is the Holy family...

1070
01:14:38,502 --> 01:14:40,493
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1071
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:44,537
How can you, as a single father
and as a Catholic...

1072
01:14:45,175 --> 01:14:48,406
possibly claim to bring up your children
without a mother?

1073
01:14:48,478 --> 01:14:51,174
There is absolutely no precedent for it...

1074
01:14:51,248 --> 01:14:54,376
in the religion
in which you allegedly believe.

1075
01:15:04,227 --> 01:15:06,627
Cat got your tongue...

1076
01:15:07,464 --> 01:15:08,829
Mr. Doyle?

1077
01:15:14,905 --> 01:15:16,167
There is...

1078
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:21,803
There is a precedent, as you'd like to call it.

1079
01:15:21,878 --> 01:15:23,641
What are you saying?

1080
01:15:24,648 --> 01:15:28,880
The fundamental building block of our faith
is not the Holy family...

1081
01:15:29,619 --> 01:15:31,450
it's the Holy Trinity.

1082
01:15:31,621 --> 01:15:34,351
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1083
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,224
When my mother died...

1084
01:15:38,328 --> 01:15:40,922
my father brought us up on his own...

1085
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:43,825
with only the Holy Spirit to guide him.

1086
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,664
He used to say the Holy Spirit was love.

1087
01:15:46,737 --> 01:15:50,070
Doesn't the Holy Bible say,
"...faith, hope and love...

1088
01:15:51,408 --> 01:15:54,434
"but the greatest of these is love"?

1089
01:15:56,546 --> 01:15:58,514
I've given up the drink.

1090
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:03,379
I've worked all the hours God sends.

1091
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:08,016
I've become a better person
to try and fill myself with the Holy Spirit...

1092
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:11,026
so I can bring my kids up
surrounded by love.

1093
01:16:14,798 --> 01:16:16,527
That's all I can do.

1094
01:16:18,035 --> 01:16:19,730
No man can do more.

1095
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,379
Silence in court.

1096
01:16:31,548 --> 01:16:32,776
Silence!

1097
01:16:34,551 --> 01:16:36,348
No further questions.

1098
01:16:36,753 --> 01:16:39,722
Your Lordship, we would request
that the court is recalled...

1099
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:42,384
when we have subpoenaed
our next witness...

1100
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,750
Evelyn Doyle.

1101
01:16:46,696 --> 01:16:49,665
The bastards.
They'll intimidate the little soul.

1102
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:55,003
Lord Jesus, I have to go to the big court
soon, to answer some questions.

1103
01:16:55,272 --> 01:16:57,240
Please let my daddy win.

1104
01:16:57,407 --> 01:17:00,865
I know you're testing him,
but I think he's getting very tired.

1105
01:17:00,944 --> 01:17:03,412
Lord, please let him win.

1106
01:17:04,081 --> 01:17:05,173
Amen.

1107
01:17:15,725 --> 01:17:18,023
- Daddy!
- Hello, love.

1108
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:20,359
Your hair.

1109
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:22,295
I told them to cut it.

1110
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:24,326
Don't you like it?

1111
01:17:25,569 --> 01:17:27,366
It's lovely, pet.

1112
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:28,870
It suits you.

1113
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:31,134
You've got your new shoes on again.

1114
01:17:33,043 --> 01:17:34,442
You've got to go now.

1115
01:17:34,511 --> 01:17:35,876
Bye, Daddy.

1116
01:17:36,713 --> 01:17:38,977
Silence in court.

1117
01:17:40,283 --> 01:17:42,843
The court will draw itself to order.

1118
01:17:50,427 --> 01:17:52,452
Now, Evelyn Doyle...

1119
01:17:54,131 --> 01:17:57,931
do you remember the time in St. Joseph's,
when you tripped in the corridor...

1120
01:17:58,001 --> 01:18:00,492
and bashed your face,
when you fell down the stairs?

1121
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:01,798
No, sir.

1122
01:18:02,339 --> 01:18:04,466
Think back to last March.

1123
01:18:05,142 --> 01:18:08,168
Apparently, Sister Felicity
had to give you some aspirin.

1124
01:18:08,445 --> 01:18:09,810
Isn't that correct?

1125
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,314
- Yes, sir, she did.
- And why was that?

1126
01:18:12,382 --> 01:18:14,850
Because my face was all swollen
and black and blue.

1127
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:17,580
Because you had fallen down the stairs.

1128
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:20,248
No. That's what Sister Brigid said.

1129
01:18:20,323 --> 01:18:22,655
According to Sister Felicity,
you made no attempt...

1130
01:18:22,726 --> 01:18:27,288
to deny the fact that you had fallen
down the stairs and bruised your face.

1131
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:32,626
You didn't say otherwise, did you?

1132
01:18:32,702 --> 01:18:33,760
No.

1133
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,469
I mean, yes.

1134
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:36,970
I'm all mixed up.

1135
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,508
So, what really happened...

1136
01:18:40,076 --> 01:18:43,273
was exactly what Sister Brigid said
had happened.

1137
01:18:43,914 --> 01:18:47,372
And you made up a story
in your letter to your father...

1138
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:49,782
because you wanted to get out
of St. Joseph's...

1139
01:18:49,853 --> 01:18:52,344
and you thought a little lie would help.

1140
01:18:52,422 --> 01:18:55,152
I didn't lie. I didn't make it up.

1141
01:18:55,225 --> 01:18:58,820
I know it must be a frightening
experience for you, Evelyn...

1142
01:18:58,895 --> 01:19:01,887
being a little girl in a big court like this.

1143
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:06,363
You must try not to be scared. Even though
you're alone in front of all these people.

1144
01:19:21,451 --> 01:19:24,818
I'm not scared anymore, Your Lordship,
and I'm not alone.

1145
01:19:25,755 --> 01:19:27,848
My granddad is here with me.

1146
01:19:28,758 --> 01:19:31,318
See. He's letting us know he's here.

1147
01:19:32,262 --> 01:19:36,096
Your Lordship, the child's grandfather
died some months ago.

1148
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:38,259
She obviously has a very...

1149
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:40,096
vivid imagination.

1150
01:19:42,339 --> 01:19:43,966
Now, child...

1151
01:19:44,741 --> 01:19:47,005
let me ask you one last time...

1152
01:19:47,077 --> 01:19:51,309
do you remember falling in the corridor
and hitting your face on the stairs?

1153
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:53,747
No, I didn't fall on the stairs.

1154
01:19:53,817 --> 01:19:57,275
I was going to tell Sister Felicity
what really happened...

1155
01:19:57,354 --> 01:20:00,517
but then I thought
it would only get Sister Brigid into trouble.

1156
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:03,684
So, I prayed that God
would forgive Sister Brigid for hitting me.

1157
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,354
This is a preposterous assertion.

1158
01:20:06,663 --> 01:20:09,461
Why on earth
would the good Sister hit you?

1159
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:13,263
Because I said she shouldn't belt Annette
for getting her catechism wrong.

1160
01:20:13,336 --> 01:20:15,600
Poor little innocent. Shame on you.

1161
01:20:15,672 --> 01:20:18,505
She was better off with Desmond Doyle.
I can see that now.

1162
01:20:18,575 --> 01:20:21,806
- Wait till I get you outside!
- Silence in court!

1163
01:20:25,482 --> 01:20:26,676
Evelyn Doyle...

1164
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:30,686
do you expect this court to believe
that after she did that to you...

1165
01:20:30,754 --> 01:20:33,314
- you prayed for her?
- Yes, I did.

1166
01:20:33,523 --> 01:20:35,991
I put it to you that you are lying.

1167
01:20:36,059 --> 01:20:38,459
Lying is a sin
against the Eighth Commandment.

1168
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:42,089
"Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor."

1169
01:20:42,365 --> 01:20:45,596
I'm surprised you don't know that,
if you're a lawyer.

1170
01:20:46,036 --> 01:20:48,630
Sister Brigid told this court
the truth of the matter...

1171
01:20:48,705 --> 01:20:51,936
that she picked you up
when you fell down the stairs.

1172
01:20:52,142 --> 01:20:56,203
No. That's not true.
Hope she goes to confession soon.

1173
01:20:59,482 --> 01:21:02,417
- Wanna hear the prayer I said last night?
- We do not.

1174
01:21:02,485 --> 01:21:04,043
Not so, Mr. Wolfe.

1175
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,147
It is material to the court's evaluation
of the child's character.

1176
01:21:08,692 --> 01:21:11,889
Evelyn, let us hear your prayer, please.

1177
01:21:13,463 --> 01:21:14,760
"Lord God...

1178
01:21:15,365 --> 01:21:18,266
"you guide the universe
with wisdom and love.

1179
01:21:18,635 --> 01:21:21,627
"Hear the prayer we make to you
for our country...

1180
01:21:21,705 --> 01:21:24,071
"the beautiful country of Ireland.

1181
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:28,634
"Through the honesty of our citizens,
and the wisdom of those who govern us...

1182
01:21:28,712 --> 01:21:31,112
"may lasting peace be delivered...

1183
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:33,680
"and truth and justice flourish."

1184
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:35,242
Amen.

1185
01:21:38,254 --> 01:21:40,313
- She's a credit to you.
- Thank you.

1186
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,551
Thank you, Evelyn. You may step down.

1187
01:21:43,793 --> 01:21:46,523
The great day has finally arrived.

1188
01:21:46,596 --> 01:21:50,589
The day Desmond Doyle and his kids,
and indeed the whole of Ireland...

1189
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:52,396
has been waiting for.

1190
01:21:52,469 --> 01:21:56,064
The day when Desmond finds out,
once and for all...

1191
01:21:56,139 --> 01:21:58,334
whether he will get his kids back.

1192
01:21:58,408 --> 01:22:01,866
Sister, why couldn't me and the boys
go to court today?

1193
01:22:01,945 --> 01:22:05,176
Because they don't want a repeat
of the scenes they had last time.

1194
01:22:05,448 --> 01:22:10,010
The Lord Mayor of Dublin has just
appeared in his official limousine...

1195
01:22:10,086 --> 01:22:12,577
and a beautiful car it is, too.

1196
01:22:13,156 --> 01:22:16,887
I would remind you, however,
that never before...

1197
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,294
has a law been found repugnant
to the Irish Constitution...

1198
01:22:21,364 --> 01:22:25,767
and that has to happen today,
if Desmond Doyle is to win.

1199
01:22:32,842 --> 01:22:36,073
I now call on Justice Ferris
to deliver his judgment.

1200
01:22:37,614 --> 01:22:42,483
I am persuaded by Mr. Wolfe's argument
on behalf of the Minister for Education...

1201
01:22:43,052 --> 01:22:45,020
that the term "parent"...

1202
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:48,114
in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution...

1203
01:22:48,558 --> 01:22:51,721
must be held to imply both parents.

1204
01:22:52,695 --> 01:22:55,186
There is no contradiction
between those Articles...

1205
01:22:55,265 --> 01:22:57,597
and Section 10 of the Children's Act...

1206
01:22:58,034 --> 01:23:02,130
and said Act
is not repugnant to the Constitution.

1207
01:23:03,373 --> 01:23:07,309
I, therefore, find in favor of the defendant,
the Minister for Education.

1208
01:23:09,112 --> 01:23:11,307
I'll strangle that ferret one day.

1209
01:23:13,883 --> 01:23:17,375
It's 1-0 to the Minister, with 2 votes to go.

1210
01:23:17,687 --> 01:23:21,054
The next Judge, Justice Daley,
must vote for Desmond...

1211
01:23:21,124 --> 01:23:23,456
or it's all over for the Doyles.

1212
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:26,618
Don't despair, my child. Have faith.

1213
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:29,492
...or there'll be rioting going on.

1214
01:23:31,701 --> 01:23:34,192
I agree with Mr. Wolfe...

1215
01:23:35,071 --> 01:23:38,199
that the Minister for Education has,
at all times...

1216
01:23:38,274 --> 01:23:41,107
acted in a reasonable
and conscientious manner...

1217
01:23:41,778 --> 01:23:44,474
within the provisions of the Children's Act.

1218
01:23:44,547 --> 01:23:48,313
I also agree with my learned
and honorable friend, Justice Ferris...

1219
01:23:48,952 --> 01:23:51,182
that there is no precedent for declaring...

1220
01:23:51,254 --> 01:23:53,916
an Irish Statute
repugnant to the Constitution...

1221
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:57,482
- Please God, grant us a "however."
- ...and therefore invalid.

1222
01:24:00,096 --> 01:24:03,190
However, despite the absence
of precedent...

1223
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,430
I find Mr. Barron's argument persuasive.

1224
01:24:07,504 --> 01:24:10,530
In any event, with respect to
my learned friend, Mr. Ferris...

1225
01:24:10,607 --> 01:24:12,939
it is the duty of the Supreme Court...

1226
01:24:13,109 --> 01:24:15,168
not only to follow precedent...

1227
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:17,706
but to set it.

1228
01:24:18,414 --> 01:24:20,314
On the grounds submitted...

1229
01:24:20,984 --> 01:24:24,112
that the Children's Act 1941, Section 10...

1230
01:24:24,187 --> 01:24:26,951
contravenes a parent's fundamental,
God-given right...

1231
01:24:27,023 --> 01:24:28,854
to the society of his children...

1232
01:24:28,925 --> 01:24:31,450
and is therefore repugnant
to the Constitution...

1233
01:24:32,228 --> 01:24:35,322
I find in favor of the plaintiff,
Desmond Doyle.

1234
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:41,392
Marvelous! Children,
don't you stop praying now.

1235
01:24:41,538 --> 01:24:46,976
...the Supreme Court. Now it all rests on the
shoulders of Justice Lynch, a Kerry man.

1236
01:24:47,043 --> 01:24:50,706
The tension in here is almost unbearable.

1237
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:56,013
I can't think of anything like it, since
Tom Connolly's last-second penalty goal...

1238
01:24:56,085 --> 01:24:59,213
that won Ireland the Triple Crown,
30 years ago.

1239
01:24:59,289 --> 01:25:00,813
And amazingly...

1240
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:04,753
Connolly is now part
of Desmond Doyle's team.

1241
01:25:05,562 --> 01:25:08,292
I have been impressed
by Desmond Doyle's diligence...

1242
01:25:08,364 --> 01:25:13,358
and determination in rebuilding
his financial and domestic circumstances...

1243
01:25:13,803 --> 01:25:16,533
in the wake of
his wife's unfortunate desertion.

1244
01:25:16,606 --> 01:25:19,666
I have noted, too,
the obvious bonds of love and affection...

1245
01:25:19,742 --> 01:25:22,472
between Doyle and his daughter, Evelyn...

1246
01:25:22,979 --> 01:25:26,005
who made a deep impression on me,
and I'm sure, on all of us...

1247
01:25:26,082 --> 01:25:29,711
- ...in the witness stand.
- Please, no. Don't give us a "however."

1248
01:25:29,786 --> 01:25:33,483
However, we are officers of the law...

1249
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,584
and must not be guided by sentiment.

1250
01:25:37,727 --> 01:25:41,458
Though Mr. Barron
made a moving and powerful plea...

1251
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:43,055
on behalf of his client...

1252
01:25:43,132 --> 01:25:45,362
a stirring appeal to the heart...

1253
01:25:46,703 --> 01:25:51,663
we, as law officers, must determine cases
with the head, not the heart.

1254
01:25:52,308 --> 01:25:53,707
Tom, have we lost?

1255
01:25:53,776 --> 01:25:56,301
I agree with my learned friend,
Justice Ferris...

1256
01:25:56,379 --> 01:25:59,712
- Yes, unless he says another "however."
- ...that it is regrettable...

1257
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:05,177
that no precedent has been cited
in support of Mr. Doyle's case.

1258
01:26:08,591 --> 01:26:09,990
However...

1259
01:26:10,627 --> 01:26:14,154
though no precedent can be found
in Irish law...

1260
01:26:14,697 --> 01:26:18,656
we can argue
from an analogous English case.

1261
01:26:19,335 --> 01:26:22,395
In the Crown versus Clark, 1891...

1262
01:26:22,472 --> 01:26:26,806
the principle of a parent's inalienable right
to his or her children...

1263
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:29,638
was enshrined in common law.

1264
01:26:31,848 --> 01:26:32,872
However...

1265
01:26:34,584 --> 01:26:36,245
...the parent's right...

1266
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:40,847
could, as common law,
be overridden by statute.

1267
01:26:44,293 --> 01:26:47,023
- However...
- Yes, dear God.

1268
01:26:47,096 --> 01:26:48,563
...unlike the English...

1269
01:26:49,065 --> 01:26:52,057
we Irish have a written Constitution...

1270
01:26:52,769 --> 01:26:56,227
so that, in the words
of Evelyn Doyle's prayer:

1271
01:26:56,673 --> 01:26:59,471
"Truth and justice may flourish."

1272
01:27:00,076 --> 01:27:04,035
I find it unarguably true,
as Mr. Barron contends...

1273
01:27:04,847 --> 01:27:08,578
a parent has
an inalienable and God-given right...

1274
01:27:08,651 --> 01:27:10,778
to the society of his children.

1275
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:14,113
I therefore find
in favor of the plaintiff, Mr. Doyle.

1276
01:27:32,775 --> 01:27:33,867
We did it!

1277
01:27:41,884 --> 01:27:43,977
Desmond Doyle has won!

1278
01:27:46,022 --> 01:27:47,182
Glory be to God!

1279
01:27:52,462 --> 01:27:55,260
- Praise be to God!
- Sister, we've won.

1280
01:27:57,233 --> 01:28:00,168
Darling child, don't you forget me.

1281
01:28:00,536 --> 01:28:02,663
I won't, Sister. I love you.

1282
01:28:10,813 --> 01:28:13,680
You'll be needing
a housekeeper now, won't you?

1283
01:28:41,844 --> 01:28:44,813
Love and glory, boys!

1284
01:28:46,015 --> 01:28:49,041
Legal history has been made.

1285
01:29:02,832 --> 01:29:06,029
Evelyn's won. We can all go home soon!

1286
01:29:24,253 --> 01:29:25,413
Daddy!

1287
01:29:27,456 --> 01:29:30,823
Oh, my love. Good to see you.

1288
01:29:44,273 --> 01:29:45,672
Let me see you.

1289
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:53,080
You look gorgeous.

1290
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:21,108
Don't worry, Heidi. I didn't forget you.

1291
01:30:28,384 --> 01:30:31,319
Let's connect these two together now.

1292
01:30:40,963 --> 01:30:42,590
Some tea, too?

1293
01:30:57,213 --> 01:30:59,909
Children, come and sit down, turkey's ready.

1294
01:30:59,982 --> 01:31:03,543
Evelyn, Maurice, Dermot,
come and sit down, everybody.

1295
01:31:03,619 --> 01:31:06,747
- I am starving.
- Okay, crackers. Get a cracker, lads.
