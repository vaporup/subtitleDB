Our holiday home, Summer 1978

6
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:36,184
Look here. Here into the camera.

7
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:42,190
Hands off!

8
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:49,447
Alex, hold on!
- Dad, help me!

9
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,410
Slowly, cautiously,
almost gently...

10
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:23,208
the giant colossus...
is placed on the launch site.

11
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:27,253
Here on the launch site
the result of the great...

12
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:31,424
community work is demonstrated.
If you want an example to emphasize the famous word:

13
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,385
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

14
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:35,804
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

15
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:38,807
... here it can be seen in perfection.

16
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:45,313
I report: I am ready for the flight
with spaceship SOJUS 31...

17
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:49,651
as a member of the international
crew.

18
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:53,238
On August 26, 1978,
we had reached international standing.

19
00:02:54,823 --> 00:03:00,870
Sigmund Jähn, citizen of the GDR,
was the first German who ever went into space.

20
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,832
However, on this day our
family went really up in smoke.

21
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:05,834
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

22
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,919
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

23
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:11,089
He stands in for his boss, professor Klinger.

24
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:15,302
Do you know of any contacts in the West
your husband might have?. - No.

25
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:20,140
Mrs Kerner, how would you
describe the state of your marriage?

26
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:25,645
Has your husband ever talked to you
about escape from the Republic?

27
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:29,733
Mrs Kerner...
Has he talked to you about that?

28
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:37,157
Allow me to present the Central Committee
of the communist party...

29
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,202
Get lost! Leave me alone!

30
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:46,916
While Sigmund Jähn bravely represented the GDR
in the depths of space,

31
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:51,087
my procreator let a class enemy
in a capitalistic country...

32
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:54,591
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

33
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:54,883
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

34
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:01,765
My mother became so sad,
that she stopped talking.

35
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:06,603
She just didn't talk anymore.
Not to us, not to others.

36
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:19,491
Mum, please come back.
It's so boring at Mrs. Schäfer's.

37
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:24,454
Mum, I love you.

38
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:41,763
The Sandman excellently adapted to the
conditions in space.

39
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:45,934
But the biggest surprise was that he
became very well acquainted...

40
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:48,979
...with Mascha.

41
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,982
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

42
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:53,441
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

43
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:58,947
In a few minutes, the sandman
and Mascha will come back to Earth.

44
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:04,452
I hope it was relayed,
so that you could see it clearly.

45
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:09,916
Mother came back after 8 weeks.
It was as if she had been transformed.

46
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,086
Surprise!
- My sweeties!

47
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,928
My Alex. My little cosmonaut.

48
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,034
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

49
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,494
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

50
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:52,500
From this moment on, my mother got married
to our socialist Fatherland.

51
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,923
Our home...

52
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:03,136
is not only
the towns and villages...

53
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:07,349
As this relation was not a sexual one,
there was a lot of vigour and energy left...

54
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,436
for us kids
and the socialist daily routine.

55
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:17,192
... is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field and the birds...

56
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:18,526
in the air and the animals on the ground...

57
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:21,029
in the air and the animals on the ground...

58
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,033
My mother became promoter of
the progress of society.

59
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:29,537
A passionate activist for the
simple needs of the people

60
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:31,039
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

61
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,624
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

62
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,042
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

63
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:37,545
Concerning: Gaudily colourful...

64
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:40,548
maternity dresses. Full-stop.

65
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:50,016
And now a report on the solemn honouring...
- This is it!

66
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:50,892
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

67
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:54,062
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

68
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:58,066
artists and veteran workers
came to Berlin today,

69
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:03,071
to receive the highest honourings
of our country in the Council of State.

70
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:03,822
to receive the highest honourings
of our country.

71
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:06,783
That's you, Mum!

72
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,996
... and recognition of outstanding
merits during the building up...

73
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:15,417
and development
of the socialist social order.

74
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,629
On the eve of the
national holiday...

75
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:23,842
the CC of the SUG
traditionally rewards men and women of merit.

76
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:29,597
After a long, untiring training
it was time. I, Alex Kerner,

77
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:34,102
was the second German to go to space.
Deeper and further than any man before.

78
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:37,105
Rocket launched!

79
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:42,652
I imaged how I would explore the riddles of the cosmos
for the good of humanity,

80
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:46,823
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

81
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:48,616
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

82
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:51,119
Rocket launched!

83
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:14,142
10 years later - October 7, 1989.

84
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:17,812
Test, one, two...

85
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,732
The GDR had its 40th anniversary.

86
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:24,903
I had a day off with the
PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"...

87
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:29,741
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

88
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,159
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

89
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,462
Left, two, three!

90
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:46,675
Time smelt of change,
while an oversized rifle association...

91
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:52,180
had its last performance
in front of our house.

92
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,695
Alex!

93
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,407
What?

94
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:12,951
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

95
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:15,203
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

96
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:18,206
Who is she?
- No idea.

97
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:21,209
But she makes a good impression.

98
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:27,966
Have you slept in your clothes again?

99
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,593
Where's the visitor?

100
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:34,764
The visitor's name is Paula...
and it's a date, as agreed. Here you are.

101
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:37,809
Oh no!
- Oh yes, little brother.

102
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:42,522
Can't your ex-boyfriend take care of her?
- He's on standby duty today.

103
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,750
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

104
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,626
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

105
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:09,299
... can't and won't wear the panties,
that are offered.

106
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:14,179
Fullstop. Even in the GDR, there
are not only young princesses on ice and...

107
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,391
exquisitly slim comrades. Full-stop.
- That's good.

108
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,018
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

109
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,771
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

110
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:26,775
Well hurry up then. It could be the last time
with these members.

111
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:30,278
Where's Paula?
- Yeah, where is she? Sleeping again?

112
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:32,280
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

113
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,908
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

114
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,828
You'll have to look for her with a magnifying glass.

115
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:45,126
I don't really know if I'll go there.
All of the party's bigwigs are there.

116
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:50,340
I don't know anyone. Although... I'd like
to see Gorbatschow at close range this once.

117
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:56,096
There they are celebrating themselves,
all the old bastards.

118
00:10:56,137 --> 00:11:00,350
Well you don't have to watch.
- Mum, don't you notice what's happening there?

119
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:03,520
And you, what do you want? Do a bunk?

120
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:09,150
Nothing will change if
they all go away. Let's go on.

121
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:14,823
It cannot be possible,
that the stouter...

122
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:19,035
...workers and farmer's wifes...
are punished by the fashion combinates...

123
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:23,206
...after the 40th year of the existence
of our Republic!

124
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:26,251
With socalist salutations...

125
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,087
Hanna Schäfer.

126
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:41,850
In the evening of October 7, 1989
several hundred people united...

127
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,854
for an evening walk,
to promote...

128
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:49,858
the idea of walking without borders.

129
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:53,486
Freedom of the press! Freedom of the press!

130
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:18,887
Cough! Cough hard!

131
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,766
Everything alright?

132
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:28,188
You alright?
- Thank you!

133
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:43,119
There're even more Greens.

134
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:46,081
Alright already!

135
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,753
Form a chain!

136
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:55,215
No violence! No violence!

137
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:02,639
You might make it
if you take the subway.

138
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,319
What's your name?

139
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,029
La...

140
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:00,113
Stop it!

141
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:02,866
Watch out!

142
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:25,388
That's my mum lying there!
- Stand still! - My mum's lying there!

143
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:42,489
Let me go, you asshole!
That's my mu......

144
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:15,355
Alexander Kerner?
- Yes?

145
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:23,488
Your mother.

146
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,670
What about mother?

147
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,760
What is it?

148
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:30,096
Mum had a heart attack.

149
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:36,436
Unfortunately, the resuscitation attempts were carried out
very late. Your mother's in a coma.

150
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:43,985
When can we talk to her?
- Alex, Mum's in a coma!

151
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:49,282
Mr. Kerner, we don't know yet,
whether or not your mother will ever wake up again.

152
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:24,734
Can you hear me, Mum?

153
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:28,488
You've got to wake up!

154
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,701
But mother was fast asleep.
In her deep, neverending sleep...

155
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:36,913
she circled like a satellite
around the events happening...

156
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:42,377
on our little planet
in our even smaller Republic.

157
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:48,717
The 9th Convention agreed to Honecker's request,
to relieve him of his duties...

158
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:53,722
because of health problems
and thanked him for his political life's work.

159
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:55,223
Congratulations!

160
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:57,225
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

161
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:59,644
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

162
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:05,608
General Secretary of the CC of the SUG
and Chairman of the GDR's council of state.

163
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:12,615
(Reporter) Berlin.
This evening the Wall fell.

164
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,076
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

165
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,245
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

166
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:22,834
Mother slept through a classical concert
at the City Hall of Schöneberg.

167
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:27,756
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

168
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:28,340
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

169
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:36,181
Open the gateway!

170
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:39,768
Stasi begone! Stasi begone!

171
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:42,771
Mother kept on sleeping. Deeply and firmly.

172
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:48,276
She missed my
first trip into the West,

173
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:52,906
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

174
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:54,783
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

175
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:58,787
Of course she also missed my
first cultural discoveries

176
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,790
in a new country.

177
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,293
Excuse me, excuse me.

178
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:06,169
Excuse me, excuse me.

179
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:13,218
Mothers deep sleep didn't allow her
to participate in the first free polling.

180
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,305
Helmut! Helmut! Helmut!

181
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:21,810
She missed how Ariane gave up her study
of economic theory...

182
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,813
Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King.

183
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,109
... and made her first practical experience
with the circulation of money.

184
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,322
The sleep saved her the moving-in of Ariane's new boyfriend.
Rainer, class enemy and barbecue man.

185
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:37,534
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

186
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,328
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

187
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:44,332
She missed the increasing Westernization of
our 79-square-metre apartment...

188
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:48,837
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

189
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:49,379
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

190
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,346
... and Rainer's enthusiasm for the
oriental customs and way of life.

191
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:05,603
The big hormanal ecstasy
that I experienced watching

192
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:09,816
a few beautiful legs,
didn't reach into her night.

193
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,244
Shit!

194
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:31,671
What're you doing there?
- I... the infusion...

195
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:36,092
And not even the first day of Nurse Lara
exchange angel from the sovjet union,

196
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,387
penetrated her black dreams.

197
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,393
There you are again.
- Hello.

198
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:52,984
I was worried about you.
- They've put me in clink.

199
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:11,336
Mother overslept the triumph of
the capitalism. - Relief!

200
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,431
And the coordination of
my hospital visits.

201
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:51,418
Do you know what I noticed?
When she's in a good mood,

202
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:56,965
she's carrying her hair loosely.
When she's in a bad mood, she puts them up.

203
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:01,177
And during the doctor's round,
she chews on her fingernails.

204
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:08,685
Don't you think
she's got a beautiful smile?

205
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,106
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

206
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:15,900
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

207
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,904
The PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"
was winded up.

208
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,409
I was the last one
and I switched off the light.

209
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,955
Then there was the reprise. As a member of the
quick-witted East-West-Team, I applied the reunification very early.

210
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:33,126
Satellite dishes blossomed
in our landscape.

211
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,754
Denis Domaschke?

212
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:38,923
Domaschke. Denis Domaschke.

213
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:44,929
Alexander Kerner?
- Here.

214
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,432
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

215
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,266
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

216
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,976
Hi.

217
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,813
And get along, guys.

218
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:57,067
Hi.
- Hello.

219
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,617
Knut Vogel?

220
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:13,291
Hello, Mum. Doctor Wagner said
we should talk to you.

221
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,462
And if I can't be there in person,
I thought it might work like this too.

222
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,633
It's 5 o' clock now.
Most of the doctors are gone

223
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:25,804
and you've finally got some peace.
Nurse Lara, who's washed you,

224
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:29,975
should be gone too. If you could see her
you'd surely wake up.

225
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:35,188
Ariane sends you her regards,
she thinks the idea with the tape is nonsense. Well, you know her.

226
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,359
She's just in the room taking care of Paula who's
getting her teeths and is screaming all the time.

227
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:43,530
Mother overslept my
unstoppable progress with Lara.

228
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:49,786
Our first romantic rendez-vous followed
4 early shifts and 35 late shifts.

229
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,394
It's loud here!

230
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:36,082
Our Russian teacher came from Minsk
and weighed a ton.

231
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:40,295
And that's all you know
about Russian women?

232
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:50,513
The wind of change blew
into the ruins of our Republic.

233
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:54,684
Summer came and Berlin was
the most beautiful place on Earth.

234
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,855
We felt like
being in the center of the world.

235
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:03,526
Where finally something moved.
And we moved with it.

236
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:07,614
It's too bad she doesn't
realize any of this.

237
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:12,160
Well, maybe it's better that way.
Everything she believed in

238
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:15,288
has dissolved into air in a few months.
Just like that.

239
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,333
And your dad?
- He was a Doctor.

240
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:24,422
He escaped into the West.
We haven't heard anything from him again.

241
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:12,262
The future was in our hands,
uncertain and promising.

242
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:23,940
Good afternoon. We're X TV and we just wanted to...

243
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,736
Hello, do you need a satellite dish?

244
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:30,447
No money?

245
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:32,615
Good afternoon!

246
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:36,036
Do you like football? Then we've got something for you.

247
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,664
Good afternoon. We're X TV and...

248
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,835
We're X TV!
Are you interested in a satellite dish?

249
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:48,089
This is Vietnam 1, there's Vietnam 2
and back there's the Viatnamese sport channel.

250
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:49,841
Alright!

251
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:58,933
To the World Cup!
- To the future! - To us!

252
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:01,186
Comrade!

253
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:14,574
At the moment this is just running
on the side.

254
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:20,705
And later...
I'll do real feature films.

255
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,212
Same label of course.

256
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,713
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

257
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,423
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

258
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,513
That's what I'm working on at the moment. Watch this!

259
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:41,935
Don't look yet.
Don't look yet, wait...

260
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,981
And... now!

261
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,000
Recognized it?

262
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,139
Now!

263
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,689
That's the famous cut from 2001,
the one with the bone.

264
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,859
The cake represents the spaceship.

265
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,742
Got it now? Yes?
- Ingenious.

266
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,714
Ingenious.

267
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:59,137
Alright, everybody laugh.

268
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,805
Alright, everybody laugh.

269
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:05,810
At the beginning of June 1990, the borders
of our GDR were worthless.

270
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:15,153
Mother kept on sleeping. But I
remembered the old words of the comrades:

271
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:19,366
"We solve problems by making headway"
and I acted.

272
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:56,820
Mum?

273
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,156
Mum!

274
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:04,869
Can you hear me?

275
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:15,338
Your mother's awakening is a wonder.
But she might not be the same person she used to be.

276
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,966
What do you mean?

277
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:22,220
There have been some cases in which
the patients didn't recognize their own children: amnesia.

278
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:24,973
Loss of memory.

279
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,517
Sorry.

280
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,272
Mental confusion. Blending of
long and short-term memory...

281
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:36,443
Taste and smell irritations,
delayed perception. We don't know,

282
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:42,157
how badly the brain was damaged.
There are a lot of uncertain possibilities.

283
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:48,246
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but mother is still in great danger.

284
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:54,169
I'm afraid I can't give you much hope
that she'll survive the next few weeks.

285
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,887
Well...

286
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,601
Can we take...
her home with us?

287
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:13,521
Out of the question.
She is in very good hands here.

288
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:18,151
It's also simpler for you.
She can't take another heart attack.

289
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:22,364
You have to keep your mother
away from any excitement, even any danger of excitement.

290
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:26,910
And I mean
any form of excitement, Mr. Kerner!

291
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,663
Any excitement.

292
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:33,708
It's life-threatening.

293
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,919
And this?

294
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,963
And this?

295
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:40,966
Isn't this a reason to get upset?

296
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:45,470
My mother doesn't know anything about the Fall of the Wall.
She'll find out about that here immediately.

297
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:49,474
Your granddaughter.

298
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,977
Your granddaughter.

299
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,479
Mummy.

300
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,987
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

301
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:02,654
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

302
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:06,324
8 months ago.

303
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,536
8... months ago?

304
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:16,001
I can't... remember.

305
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:20,964
That's normal. It will come back to you.
You just have to have patience.

306
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:24,009
And what... what happened?

307
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:29,431
Well, that was...
- It was October.

308
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:33,101
I think you wanted to go shopping.

309
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:37,397
And... there was a big queue in
front of the store. And it was so hot,

310
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:41,192
you just collapsed.
- In October?

311
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:46,197
It was a really hot October.
Back then.

312
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:48,742
Yes.

313
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:51,286
And then?

314
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:55,040
You were in a coma, Mum.

315
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:02,839
I want to go home.

316
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:06,051
That I promise you.

317
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:09,804
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

318
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:10,263
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

319
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:14,392
Alex, that's complete madness.
- We don't leave her alone, we promised her.

320
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:18,605
Mum is fatally ill.
It's better for her here. They've got the equipment.

321
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:23,276
Just this once, be realistic.
- No, you be realistic.

322
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:27,614
What happens when she doesn't have a single room anymore?
Or when someone lets the cat out of the bag?

323
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:32,118
She'll hear what is happening outside in here.
She won't take it.

324
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:37,916
Alright, all of this rubbish has to come out.

325
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:43,880
Are mum's curtains still in the basement
- You can't be serious.

326
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,925
They're rawlplugged.

327
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:50,595
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

328
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,097
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

329
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:55,600
Can you please tell me what he's doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

330
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,604
What should I think? - What should he think?
- That you have to make way.

331
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:03,108
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

332
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:03,942
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

333
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:08,113
Generous of you, Rainer! - For the whole apartment!
47,80 German Mark! In the West
that's not even enough for a telephone bill!

334
00:34:08,154 --> 00:34:12,283
And in the East you have to wait 10 years to get a telephone connection!
- Can't you just...?

335
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:16,454
Mum has to find the room
in the same condition she left it in. The doctor said

336
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:20,625
she has to stay in bad okay?
So it's only about this one room.

337
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:25,505
And when she's better, we'll see what we'll do.
- You didn't get what the doctor said. Mum will probably...

338
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:29,718
That's what you said 3 months ago,
when you wanted to switch off the machines.

339
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:34,556
That was a different situation, you can't compare this!
- What do you want to tell her then, Ariane?

340
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:39,811
That you've given up your studies,
because you're selling Hamburgers now?

341
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:46,067
"Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King."

342
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,165
8th floor?.
- Yeah.

343
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:03,168
Elevator, hm?
- Broken. - Shit.

344
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,670
You can say that again.

345
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:41,456
My life changed drastically.

346
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:44,209
My life changed drastically.

347
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:48,213
And the day we wanted to take mum home
was ever drawing nearer,

348
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:51,716
relentlessly like a big Russian tank.

349
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,718
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

350
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,179
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

351
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:01,559
And how do you look?
It would be nice if you would think a little for a change.

352
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:05,063
Look at this. This garbage is what we used to wear.

353
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:11,778
Sign here.

354
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,991
The physiotherapist is coming
3 times a week. Have you got any more questions?

355
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:21,204
Your mother is going at her own responsibility.
You know how I think about this.

356
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:24,332
Where is the previous Doctor, by the way?

357
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:28,545
Doctor Wagner, he went to Düsseldorf.
- I understand. And you?

358
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:33,591
When do you run away?
And you want to lecture me about responsibility.

359
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:41,599
Please lie down a second.

360
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:46,229
Why?
- Please. Just lie down.

361
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:59,659
If there's another cardiac arrest:
short, strong thumps on the chest.

362
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:05,373
Careful! She mustn't wake up.
- Alright, boss!

363
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:09,961
Ariane and I'll set up a schedule.
And there's the physiotherapest.

364
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:13,173
There's always someone with her. It'll work.

365
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:17,886
Most GDR citizens already exchanged
their savings cashlessly.

366
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:22,057
There are only 2 weeks left.
You should hurry. Because as Gorbatschow once said:

367
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:25,185
He who is late...
- Excuse me?.

368
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:28,313
will be punished all his life. - I can't hear it anymore.
- Excuse me!

369
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:32,484
Could you tune down the radio please?
My mother needs rest.

370
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:35,236
Alright, boss.

371
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:44,913
Don't you want to introduce us?
- Oh yes, of course. This is Lara.

372
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:47,040
Hello, Lara.

373
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,682
Could you let me past, please?

374
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:10,397
Hello, Christiane!

375
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:14,275
Alex! What is it?

376
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,820
Hello? Alex!

377
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:31,751
Nothing's changed in here.

378
00:38:33,003 --> 00:38:36,089
What should have changed?

379
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:40,260
Oh, if you're bored,
you can listen to cassettes.

380
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:43,430
I'm afraid the radio receiver is broken.

381
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:46,725
But I'll repair that.
- Alex?

382
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:56,026
It's good to know
you're not alone.

383
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:01,448
When your father...

384
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:07,829
When he was suddenly gone...

385
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,209
I didn't think I'd make it.

386
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:21,009
I never told you that...

387
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,225
I thought about laying hands upon myself.

388
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:37,651
But you visited every day.

389
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:42,113
And you talked about school and Sigmund Jähn.

390
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:45,241
You heard that?

391
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:52,999
I'm sorry to cause you so much work.

392
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:57,045
I can't even use the toilet by myself.
- Mum.

393
00:39:57,462 --> 00:40:00,465
That doesn't matter.

394
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,761
The important thing is for you to get well.

395
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:07,889
I'll try hard.

396
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,393
You have to rest now.

397
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:17,774
I'll just go to the shop,
but Ariane is still there.

398
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,569
Oh, Alex...?

399
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:26,157
I'm craving for Spreewood gherkins.
Can you fetch me some?

400
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,743
No problem, Mum.

401
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:32,956
That's what I thought.

402
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:41,006
At the end of June 1990 the shops of
our socialist Fatherland were emptied.

403
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:45,927
Real money was coming in from the country
behind the Wall.

404
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:53,727
While most citizens queued in long lines in front of the
Republic banks with their usual patience...

405
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:56,604
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

406
00:40:56,604 --> 00:41:00,025
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

407
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:16,041
Yearned for by everyone, the German Mark flooded
our little community.

408
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:19,586
Halleluja, Halleluja...

409
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:22,756
Halleluja, German Mark!

410
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:27,594
(Song) Such a day, so wonderful...

411
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:31,389
And the money was exchanged 2 to 1.
Germany won 1:0!

412
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:37,020
Unstoppable shot!
Germany is one-nil up by Lothar Matthäus!

413
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:55,580
Mocca Fix? - Haven't got that anymore.
Filinchen Crispbread? - Not for sale anymore.

414
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:59,834
Spreewood gherkins?
- Goodness, where do you live, boy?

415
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:04,422
We've got the German Mark now. And there you come
asking for Mocca Fix and Filinchen?

416
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:09,844
Over night, our grey store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

417
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:10,387
Over night, our store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

418
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:14,015
And I became the king as a customer.

419
00:42:14,057 --> 00:42:16,810
They're from the Netherlands.

420
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:24,150
Good afternoon, Mr. Ganske.

421
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:37,622
That's how far they've driven us already...
that we have to go fishing in the garbage.

422
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,168
Mister Ganske,
have you still got Spreewood gherkins?

423
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,213
What?
- Spreewood gherkins!

424
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:49,676
I'm sorry, young man.
I'm unemployed myself.

425
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:54,514
An empty glass would do, too.

426
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:23,251
I wanted to introduce Rainer to Mum today.

427
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:27,339
Later.
We don't want to demand to much of her.

428
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,263
Perhaps you're right.

429
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:38,058
Yes.

430
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:43,521
I'm afraid there was a supply shortage
for Spreewood gherkins.

431
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,858
It's alright. These are fine too.

432
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:55,325
Listen, you really don't have to take
care of me all the time.

433
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:58,370
It's awkward for me.
- Mum.

434
00:43:58,495 --> 00:44:01,498
No, really. Maybe...

435
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:07,045
... you could put the TV next to the bed.
Then I'll manage by my own.

436
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:11,299
Watching TV still is too tiring for you.
- But why? Why shouldn't I...

437
00:44:11,341 --> 00:44:17,263
be able to watch TV?
- We'll ask the Doctor.

438
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:22,727
Mum, we have to talk to you about something.

439
00:44:22,811 --> 00:44:25,814
It's like this...

440
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:29,025
We wanted to ask you if...

441
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:33,863
We need your authorization to access your bank account.
- What is it?

442
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:38,326
Do you need money?
- No. No.

443
00:44:40,036 --> 00:44:44,165
It's just that you can't go walk
the bank by yourself anymore.

444
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:47,335
And it would simply be better if...

445
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:50,922
you sign this.

446
00:44:50,964 --> 00:44:53,675
Yes, and...

447
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:56,720
maybe now would be best.

448
00:45:01,641 --> 00:45:04,644
But there's no hurry is there?

449
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:13,236
You're keeping something from me?
Has something happened? Are you in debt?

450
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,406
Please trust us, it's important!

451
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:22,912
Before I let you have all my money,
I have got a right to know what it's for don't I?

452
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:24,831
All right.

453
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,210
It was supposed to be
a surprise but...

454
00:45:29,669 --> 00:45:33,423
We received a notification.

455
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:36,509
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

456
00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:38,219
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

457
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:40,722
After only 3 years?

458
00:45:40,722 --> 00:45:44,726
And for that we need the money
that you've saved.

459
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:52,651
You don't think...
I got my money at the bank?

460
00:45:55,528 --> 00:45:58,531
I've hidden it.

461
00:45:59,532 --> 00:46:02,243
And where?
- Where?

462
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:12,045
I forgot.

463
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:18,468
I've totally forgotten, it's all gone.
- Mum, just think.

464
00:46:28,603 --> 00:46:32,774
Father is coming home late today,
don't you think?

465
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:59,676
Mum...

466
00:47:01,303 --> 00:47:06,099
That's alright.
Soon you'll be better again.

467
00:47:08,351 --> 00:47:12,522
We'll celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

468
00:47:13,982 --> 00:47:18,778
With the house community.
We have always celebrated it.

469
00:47:23,116 --> 00:47:27,912
This is the First German Television
with the news.

470
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:33,001
Comrade Ganske watches West-TV?

471
00:47:38,506 --> 00:47:42,552
Comrade Ganske fell in love.
During a vacation in Hungary.

472
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:45,722
With a pensioner from... Munich.

473
00:47:46,681 --> 00:47:49,809
Since then his love for the party has suffered.

474
00:47:49,976 --> 00:47:51,853
Oh.
- Well...

475
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,316
Are you finished?

476
00:48:00,236 --> 00:48:04,866
I'm sorry I'm late again.
- There it is. Even with a balcony.

477
00:48:04,908 --> 00:48:07,077
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

478
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:08,870
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

479
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:13,375
the apartment market in the Capital eased considerably.

480
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:17,379
There were deserted apartments everywhere,
which we only had to enter.

481
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:19,381
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

482
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,549
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

483
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,527
Get a load of that! - Get a load of that
- It's working! - Tempo-beans!

484
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:28,450
Globus green peas!
That can't be true.

485
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:32,954
Mocca Fix Gold!
I've been looking for that all the time!

486
00:49:42,464 --> 00:49:44,549
Can I have that?

487
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,794
I have to go.

488
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:26,383
Sleep on...

489
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:53,368
Morning, Mum.

490
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,121
Morning, Alex.

491
00:50:57,497 --> 00:51:00,625
Are you in a hurry?
- I have to go to work.

492
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:03,670
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

493
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,046
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

494
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:11,052
Oh and about my birthday.
Invite Klapprath and perhaps a few pupils.

495
00:51:11,052 --> 00:51:15,056
As if the fucking gherkins weren't enough trouble already.
Now she wants to watch TV.

496
00:51:15,223 --> 00:51:19,352
What should I do?
- Yeah, Houston. We got a problem.

497
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:25,650
Yeah, and now? - I thought you might have an idea.
No, I meant the picture.

498
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:28,361
Oh.

499
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,493
Now?
- Nope.

500
00:51:35,535 --> 00:51:40,707
It didn't work very long.
- Semi-finale! I'll just go over to the Pollnicks.

501
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:43,460
Then go already.

502
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:48,548
Excuse me.
Are those gherkins from the Spreewood?

503
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,134
Nope, from the Netherlands.

504
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:57,098
Just show her something old.
- What do you mean?

505
00:51:57,974 --> 00:52:01,061
Old East-TV stuff on video tape.

506
00:52:01,102 --> 00:52:04,689
News from last year? She'll notice for sure.

507
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:09,402
Ah, I don't think so. It was always the same rubbish.
- Where should I get the videos from?

508
00:52:09,444 --> 00:52:13,031
I haven't even got a recorder.
- Bad enough.

509
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:14,783
What's the score?

510
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:15,283
What's the score?

511
00:52:15,325 --> 00:52:20,121
Beckenbauer, Rudi Völler...
You don't want to see it...

512
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:25,335
Germany made it into the finale!

513
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:32,425
While the world time clock at the Alexander Square
rushed towards mother's birthday,

514
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:36,596
a tiny round ball united the social development...

515
00:52:36,638 --> 00:52:40,767
of the split nation and let things, that belonged
together, grow together.

516
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:45,230
I slaved away like a Hero of Labour to resurrect
the GDR in every detail

517
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:49,442
in mother's room until this day.

518
00:52:49,484 --> 00:52:53,655
Have the cross-word puzzles already been solved?
- Untouched like a virgin.

519
00:52:53,697 --> 00:52:56,700
Great. I'll take them all.

520
00:52:57,742 --> 00:53:00,745
Oh and these ones too.

521
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:07,669
They laid my daughter off too.
All of a sudden it was: "Thank you, and goodbye."

522
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:12,173
And for that we worked for 40 years, oh leave me alone......
They'll even drop the TV ballet.

523
00:53:12,173 --> 00:53:14,175
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

524
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:15,093
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

525
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:19,264
To get back to my mother. The problem is that

526
00:53:19,306 --> 00:53:23,476
she doesn't know about the Fall of the Wall
- Enviable.

527
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:30,525
And it's her birthday next week.
She would really be happy about a visit.

528
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:36,448
Have you really got it now?
I don't want to hear one false word.

529
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:39,576
And our 20 Marks?
- The work comes first.

530
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:44,289
The first guests were invited.
Others still had to be persuaded.

531
00:53:44,331 --> 00:53:48,460
A lot of people of the Polytechnical Secondary School
"Werner Seelenbinder"...

532
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:52,631
had withdrawn to their private lives.
Including Doctor Klapprath.

533
00:53:52,672 --> 00:53:53,923
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

534
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:56,217
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

535
00:53:56,217 --> 00:53:59,721
We were all valuable people.

536
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:02,223
Isn't that right, Alex?

537
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:06,227
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

538
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:08,813
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

539
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:11,858
And an excellent human being.

540
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:15,236
That's why she was neutralized.

541
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:21,284
Some comrades in the collective
thought her to be too...

542
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:25,080
idealistic.

543
00:54:25,288 --> 00:54:27,999
Ever since your father...

544
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:33,463
Her idealism was well-respected, but...

545
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:39,594
in the daily school routine, it...
can become problematic sometimes.

546
00:54:40,428 --> 00:54:43,556
And then you simply gave her the boot.

547
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:52,732
You still owe her something.
- Yes.

548
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,784
You're a Dispatcher. Can you remember that?
- Dispatcher? In the East?

549
00:55:02,784 --> 00:55:07,289
Yes, of course in the East. You organize the
purchasing of a Mitropa-Restaurant.

550
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:11,293
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

551
00:55:11,293 --> 00:55:11,710
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

552
00:55:11,918 --> 00:55:16,047
And you were Group Council Chairman with
the Pioneers. - Group Council... what?

553
00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:19,175
Group Council Chairman.
- That's enough.

554
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:25,432
I won't use those plastic diapers anymore.
That's going too far.

555
00:55:26,224 --> 00:55:29,352
Got it?
Yes, Group Council Chairman.

556
00:55:29,644 --> 00:55:33,773
Here you are, 30 broadcasts of "Current Camera",
10 broadcasts of "Black Channel"...

557
00:55:33,815 --> 00:55:37,944
6 broadcasts "Colourful Boiler" and 4 broadcasts of
"A Day in the West". It's all copied.

558
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:42,115
Sponsored by the country's picture library
and a very charming Denis.

559
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:43,783
I hope that'll work.

560
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:53,627
What are you doing crawling on the ground?
- That's the cable for the antenna so you can watch TV?

561
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:08,183
We've got the World Cup. Truly a gift.
There is no better time to

562
00:56:08,224 --> 00:56:11,353
supply satellite dishes to the East.

563
00:56:12,187 --> 00:56:15,315
Okay? Got it? We come to phase 3...

564
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:25,742
What was that?
- No idea. Interferences, happens from time to time.

565
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:30,080
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to the "Current Camera".

566
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:35,794
Hard provocation against the border.
Protests in the Chancellor's office in the FRG (West Germany).

567
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:39,965
Chip-Power GDR.
The foreign press acknowledges achievements...

568
00:56:40,006 --> 00:56:44,135
Things are running outside
and I feel so useless in here.

569
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:48,306
Can't you put a note on the house community's
pin board?

570
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:53,436
Whoever's got any problems can come to me.
I can write inputs from bed.

571
00:56:53,478 --> 00:56:57,649
I don't know.
You shouldn't exert yourself.

572
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:03,905
Morning, Alex. Is it time already?

573
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:16,167
You want a swig? You want a swig?
- Oh holy shit!

574
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:22,132
Shit. Shit, yes? Shit!

575
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:25,635
Goodness, goddamn shit!

576
00:57:40,734 --> 00:57:43,445
I feel sick.

577
00:57:48,742 --> 00:57:50,535
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

578
00:57:50,535 --> 00:57:52,954
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

579
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:56,458
sounds from the past
came out of mother's bedroom.

580
00:57:56,458 --> 00:58:01,463
Our home
is not only the towns...

581
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:02,964
and villages...

582
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:09,137
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

583
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:11,931
Our home...

584
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:17,270
is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field...

585
00:58:18,355 --> 00:58:21,149
and the birds...

586
00:58:21,399 --> 00:58:26,696
in the air and the animals on the ground...

587
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:32,953
and the fishes in the river are the home...

588
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:35,914
And we love the...

589
00:58:43,129 --> 00:58:46,883
That was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, children.

590
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:50,887
You learned that from me, didn't you?

591
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:54,849
Yes.

592
00:58:58,937 --> 00:59:01,314
Dear Christiane!

593
00:59:01,356 --> 00:59:04,484
We are here... today... here,

594
00:59:04,609 --> 00:59:08,655
because it's your birthday.
And... I would like to wish...

595
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:14,119
you all the best
in the name of the party direction.

596
00:59:15,912 --> 00:59:17,789
And...

597
00:59:19,165 --> 00:59:21,042
the basket.

598
00:59:23,378 --> 00:59:25,255
For you.

599
00:59:26,172 --> 00:59:29,301
That's kind of you. Thank you.

600
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:33,179
Klapprath.

601
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:36,975
Rosenthaler Kadarka... Mocca Fix Gold...

602
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:41,354
Globus green peas.

603
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,609
The colleagues and... the comrades...

604
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:51,197
of the POS "Werner Seelenbinder"... they...

605
00:59:52,407 --> 00:59:56,578
would like to thank you in particular
for all the years,

606
00:59:57,412 --> 01:00:00,540
Christiane, that you... were...

607
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:05,670
a... good colleague...

608
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:09,382
and... a dear comrade...

609
01:00:11,176 --> 01:00:13,887
uhm...

610
01:00:15,347 --> 01:00:19,809
And anyway, I wish you all the best
for your birthday and remain the same person you are...

611
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:21,936
Christiane.

612
01:00:30,236 --> 01:00:33,239
Dear comrade Kerner...

613
01:00:34,366 --> 01:00:37,369
All the best...

614
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:40,538
and... good health...

615
01:00:41,122 --> 01:00:44,876
and that everything will be
as it used to be again.

616
01:00:48,588 --> 01:00:51,299
Lara, come here.

617
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:58,515
This is Lara.

618
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:01,810
An exchange student from the Soviet Union.

619
01:01:02,769 --> 01:01:05,897
Her dad is a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

620
01:01:07,273 --> 01:01:11,027
Don't marry him too early.
- Mum.

621
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:15,490
Even though the thing with the flat
will work out earlier then.

622
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:20,996
My Alex can be
a real block-head sometimes.

623
01:01:23,206 --> 01:01:25,917
And Rainer...

624
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:29,838
that's my Ariane's new boyfriend.

625
01:01:30,422 --> 01:01:33,425
He... he is a...

626
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,804
Dispatcher.
- Right, I'm a Dispatcher.

627
01:01:38,888 --> 01:01:43,643
I used to be with them myself...
All the best from the heart... Pioneers!

628
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:47,814
I used to be with the
Free German Pioneers...

629
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:50,191
Thank you, Rainer.

630
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:52,944
As a Group... um...

631
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:55,238
Cha...

632
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:58,575
Group Chairman... back then...
- Thank you!

633
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:04,080
Be ready, be ready!
- Thank you, Rainer!

634
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:12,130
Yes, Mum. Another year is over.
What's changed?

635
01:02:13,256 --> 01:02:18,053
Not much really.
Paula got her teeth and a new dad.

636
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,264
And me... yes.

637
01:02:21,306 --> 01:02:25,727
Unfortunately, we cannot go over to
the Café Moskow to drink to your health,

638
01:02:25,727 --> 01:02:29,731
but we're all together.
And that's the most important thing.

639
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:33,735
We didn't always make it easy for you,
but you were always there for us.

640
01:02:34,027 --> 01:02:38,156
And, by any rate, I can't think of
a better family than ours.

641
01:02:38,198 --> 01:02:42,827
And that's what I wanted to thank you for.
Mum, you're the best mother in the world.

642
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:45,956
Alex?
- And we all love you.

643
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:48,708
Alex?.
- What's the matter?

644
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:51,836
What's that?

645
01:02:54,339 --> 01:02:57,425
That's...
- Yes, what's the meaning of that?

646
01:02:57,467 --> 01:03:01,596
I don't know what the comrades are doing there again...
A fata morgana.

647
01:03:01,638 --> 01:03:07,060
That's from the West.
- It's a mirage.

648
01:03:10,313 --> 01:03:15,860
It will have been approved somehow.
- Please calm down, Mum!

649
01:03:15,902 --> 01:03:19,030
There's an explanation for everything. Right...

650
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,868
Boys, please sing something, will you?

651
01:03:24,202 --> 01:03:27,330
Lara! Wait a moment, I... Lara?.

652
01:03:29,124 --> 01:03:32,877
"Build up, build up".

653
01:03:35,255 --> 01:03:37,007
What's the matter all of a sudden?

654
01:03:37,048 --> 01:03:42,220
Build up.
For a better future...

655
01:03:42,637 --> 01:03:45,265
we build up our home...

656
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:50,812
I'm sorry for your mother.
What you're doing is too scary for me.

657
01:03:53,273 --> 01:03:57,402
And what is this nonsense
about my father being a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

658
01:03:57,444 --> 01:04:01,656
He was a simple cook, you know that.
- But she rejoiced in that.

659
01:04:01,698 --> 01:04:07,120
What should I've told her?
That he's dead? In her state?

660
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:14,419
You mean to say, when you're lying already,
it doesn't make any difference anyway.

661
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:18,256
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

662
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:20,175
Lara!

663
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:24,638
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

664
01:04:24,971 --> 01:04:27,682
three cheers for her!

665
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:31,227
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

666
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:44,032
Just a little further away.

667
01:04:44,032 --> 01:04:45,075
Just a little further away.

668
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:47,869
Just a little more..

669
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:52,040
Watch out, will you? We're filming here!
- Can I see your authorization?

670
01:04:52,082 --> 01:04:55,835
Didn't he inform you?
- Me? Who?

671
01:04:56,878 --> 01:04:59,965
Oh, what was his name?
- Something with "M".

672
01:05:00,006 --> 01:05:04,177
I'll just go and ask around.
Until then, you don't film anything!

673
01:05:05,804 --> 01:05:09,557
Got the logo? - Yes.
Sharpness on me?- Yes.

674
01:05:13,144 --> 01:05:17,274
We're waiting for the evening sun.
- Don't overdo it, the guy will be back soon.

675
01:05:17,315 --> 01:05:21,403
Just you wait.
With the evening sun it'll look brill.

676
01:05:21,903 --> 01:05:26,032
When I stared at the clouds on that day,
I realized that the truth

677
01:05:26,074 --> 01:05:30,203
was just a doubtful matter,
that I could adapt to mother's

678
01:05:30,245 --> 01:05:31,204
familiar surroundings.

679
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:33,081
familiar surroundings.

680
01:05:34,582 --> 01:05:38,586
I only had to study the language
of "Current Camera"...

681
01:05:38,586 --> 01:05:42,590
and spur on Denis' ambition
as a film director.

682
01:05:44,676 --> 01:05:49,389
Today Günther Mittag, secretary for Economy
in the CC of the SUD,

683
01:05:49,431 --> 01:05:53,977
visited the Coca Cola group in West Berlin.
The reason for the comrade's visit are...

684
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:58,857
details of the completed
trade agreement between Coca Cola...

685
01:05:58,898 --> 01:06:02,027
and the VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig.

686
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:07,282
Security officers of West Berlin hinder
the work of the GDR television.

687
01:06:07,324 --> 01:06:11,453
Surely, the capitalistic press
censors find the loss the mighty

688
01:06:11,494 --> 01:06:15,040
Coca Cola group has suffered against the
VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig...

689
01:06:15,081 --> 01:06:19,210
in the patent procedure too embarrassing...
Please let the GDR television

690
01:06:19,252 --> 01:06:23,381
work undisturbed!
- That's it, I'm calling the police!

691
01:06:23,423 --> 01:06:27,552
A testimonial of international
scientists now finally confirmed

692
01:06:27,594 --> 01:06:31,723
to the Collective Combine,
that the original Coca Cola flavour

693
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:37,020
was developed in the 50s
in laboratories of the GDR. Back to the studio.

694
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:40,815
Coca Cola is a socialist drink?

695
01:06:41,149 --> 01:06:44,736
I thought, Cola existed before the war.

696
01:06:44,778 --> 01:06:48,907
Don't you understand, Mum?
The West ripped us off all these years!

697
01:06:48,949 --> 01:06:53,078
Until the end of August
593 deaths by drugs were registered.

698
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,290
60% more than in the year before.
- Now I remember!

699
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:02,587
What?
- Where I hid the money.

700
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:07,175
In the living room. In the small chest of drawers.

701
01:07:07,217 --> 01:07:10,804
In the left drawer
under the wax paper.

702
01:07:10,845 --> 01:07:14,474
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste.

703
01:07:14,516 --> 01:07:17,644
How could I forget?

704
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:26,486
Hey, here I am!
- Oh, hello!

705
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,658
And?

706
01:07:33,618 --> 01:07:37,205
Has she swallowed it?
- Yes, of course. - Really?

707
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:41,418
Has she really swallowed it?
- I'm telling you.

708
01:07:44,754 --> 01:07:48,925
They've driven us this far!
- Good evening, Mister Ganske.

709
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:53,054
They betrayed us and sold us out!

710
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:56,683
The lack of sharpness didn't irritate her?
- No.

711
01:07:56,725 --> 01:08:00,854
And for that we worked 40 years...
- We could rebuild a studio.

712
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:05,066
We would have different possibilites
with a blue box.

713
01:08:05,191 --> 01:08:07,902
What... what are you doing there?

714
01:08:24,753 --> 01:08:28,256
And? What should we do with it?
- Exchange it, of course.

715
01:08:29,758 --> 01:08:32,260
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

716
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,095
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

717
01:08:34,804 --> 01:08:38,933
But it's a special case.
- We've only just found it today.

718
01:08:38,975 --> 01:08:43,104
It's even okay for us,
if you exchange 1 to 4 or 1 to 5...

719
01:08:43,146 --> 01:08:47,776
I'm afraid there is no prolongation.
And we wouldn't have exchanged cash anyway.

720
01:08:47,817 --> 01:08:50,904
That can't be!
- It has to be possible!

721
01:08:50,946 --> 01:08:55,075
I'm sure you heard me. Time's up!
- Your time is up soon, you bastard!

722
01:08:55,116 --> 01:08:59,245
These are 30,000 East Marks! That was our money,
for 40 damned years!

723
01:08:59,287 --> 01:09:03,416
Now you Western fuck want to tell me,
this isn't worth anything?

724
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:07,212
Please leave our premises now.

725
01:09:07,629 --> 01:09:10,757
Keep your hands off! And what are you all gawking at?

726
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:14,302
It used to be your money, too!

727
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,933
Keep your hands off! You assholes!

728
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:29,442
Are you going mad or what?

729
01:09:30,068 --> 01:09:34,197
I felt like a Commander
of a submarine in the Northsea-Fleet,

730
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:38,368
whose battle-hardened steel skin
had sprung a leak.

731
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:42,539
Everytime I closed a leak,
another one opened.

732
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:46,710
Ariane denied being my brother in arms,
the class enemy raised his Cola-flag

733
01:09:46,751 --> 01:09:52,173
and a fresh wind from the West
blew mother's East money around my ears.

734
01:09:54,676 --> 01:09:57,804
What're you laughing about?
- Yell.

735
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:01,016
Why?
- You have to vent some air.

736
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:04,477
Open up your valves. Just yell!

737
01:10:33,131 --> 01:10:37,260
In Summer 1990, the German
national team exceeded the plan...

738
01:10:37,302 --> 01:10:41,306
and became World Cup holder.

739
01:10:41,514 --> 01:10:44,559
And mother kept on getting better.

740
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:44,976
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

741
01:10:44,976 --> 01:10:48,897
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

742
01:10:48,897 --> 01:10:52,400
and the length of a "Size 38". Full-stop.

743
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:57,405
I don't know how the employees
of Milena come to these measurements.

744
01:10:57,656 --> 01:11:03,578
In the Capital there are no people who
are so small and square. Full-stop.

745
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,583
Christiane, that's good.

746
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:14,422
If it's our fault...
If it's... our fault...

747
01:11:16,007 --> 01:11:22,222
that we cannot accommodate the Central Plan
with our sizes, comma...

748
01:11:22,889 --> 01:11:26,643
we would like to apologize for that. Full stop.

749
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:30,981
In this case...
we shall endeavour to become, comma...

750
01:11:31,022 --> 01:11:35,193
in the future, smaller and
squarer. Full stop.

751
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,282
With socialist salutations.

752
01:11:40,782 --> 01:11:42,867
Hanna Schäfer.

753
01:11:47,706 --> 01:11:49,916
Hello, Mrs. Schäfer.

754
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:55,630
Oh Alex. It's so nice to talk to your mother.
It feels just like living in the past.

755
01:11:55,672 --> 01:11:59,801
A little changes here and there
and I'll send it to the OTTO mail-order company.

756
01:12:02,804 --> 01:12:05,015
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

757
01:12:05,015 --> 01:12:06,975
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

758
01:12:06,975 --> 01:12:09,477
Our home...

759
01:12:13,982 --> 01:12:17,485
I've got some nice visitors.
That's Frank and Christian...

760
01:12:17,485 --> 01:12:20,488
of my former class.
- Hello.

761
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:24,576
Hello.
Mrs. Kerner has to rest now, alright?

762
01:12:25,535 --> 01:12:28,538
Bye.
- Alex, why?

763
01:12:30,749 --> 01:12:34,878
Now scram!
- And the 20 Marks? - What 20 Marks?

764
01:12:34,919 --> 01:12:39,090
Sascha said,
we'd get 20 Marks for that!

765
01:12:39,299 --> 01:12:43,428
Hello, Mr. Mehlert. - Hello, Alex.
Problems with the toaster?

766
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:47,932
My mother will be happy,
just go ahead. And you get out of here!

767
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:53,396
And tell your mates, I don't want to see a Pioneer here ever again. - Alright, boss.

768
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:02,197
Have you gone nuts?

769
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,368
You can't just let the
boys in here!

770
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:09,496
But why? She was pleased, wasn't she?

771
01:13:09,537 --> 01:13:15,752
You can't do anything right with you Easties!
Having something to complain about is what matters to you most!

772
01:13:15,794 --> 01:13:19,923
You're just like your mother
and her stupid GDR-inputs.

773
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:22,008
My mother doesn't grumble!
She's trying to change

774
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:26,179
the conditions of the society step by
step through constructive criticism. - Sure.

775
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:29,307
And you were never interested in that!
- Nope.

776
01:13:29,349 --> 01:13:34,020
Haven't you noticed?
We're in the socialist veteran's club.

777
01:13:34,062 --> 01:13:37,691
Good evening.
Why don't you take admission fees?

778
01:13:37,732 --> 01:13:39,818
Yeah, let's charge admission fees!

779
01:13:39,859 --> 01:13:44,447
You be quiet.
He's bought a Trabbi (GDR car). - Really?

780
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:46,366
An estate car.

781
01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:50,704
That can't be happening. Paula will get a defect,
if this goes on much longer. - Oh come on!

782
01:13:50,745 --> 01:13:54,332
20 years in the GDR didn't harm
our health, did they?

783
01:13:54,374 --> 01:13:57,502
I've really got my doubts about you.

784
01:13:58,044 --> 01:14:00,755
Shit. Shit!

785
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:08,638
Well done. Get a cloth.

786
01:14:24,112 --> 01:14:27,240
What is it? Nosebleeds again.

787
01:14:33,496 --> 01:14:37,626
I know it's a little stressful at the moment
I'd also prefer,

788
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:43,089
if we didn't have to...
- I saw dad... earlier.

789
01:14:44,341 --> 01:14:47,052
Where?.
- At work.

790
01:14:48,637 --> 01:14:51,765
I recognized his voice immediately.

791
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:54,517
What did he say?

792
01:14:54,684 --> 01:14:56,811
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

793
01:14:56,811 --> 01:14:58,647
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

794
01:15:03,151 --> 01:15:06,655
Um, 3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise!

795
01:15:21,795 --> 01:15:24,798
And... what does he look like?

796
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:32,097
He drives a Volvo estate car and
got glasses with a golden rim.

797
01:15:33,974 --> 01:15:36,977
What did you tell him?

798
01:15:37,936 --> 01:15:42,315
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

799
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:49,739
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

800
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:19,603
My father lived somewhere in this City.
I saw his image in my mind.

801
01:16:19,644 --> 01:16:25,859
A fat guy who stuffed himself with cheeseburgers
and chips all day.

802
01:16:33,575 --> 01:16:37,162
He lived in his world and I lived in mine.

803
01:16:37,203 --> 01:16:41,374
He didn't have anything to do with me
and I didn't have anything to do with him.

804
01:16:50,091 --> 01:16:53,595
Hold still or it won't work.

805
01:16:53,637 --> 01:16:56,765
Will it take much longer?

806
01:16:59,976 --> 01:17:04,147
'cause I have to be home
in 2 hours at the latest.

807
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:10,111
You always have to be somewhere in 2 hours.
It's getting boring.

808
01:17:10,946 --> 01:17:15,075
Oh great. I got a sick mother,
a demanding job...

809
01:17:15,116 --> 01:17:19,245
and a miffed girlfriend.
- I've got my exams in 2 days.

810
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:23,458
It's second nature to you.
This little bit of putting a plaster on.

811
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,753
Then I can stop learning, can't I?

812
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:32,550
I was well-meant.
I believe in you.

813
01:17:33,218 --> 01:17:36,346
Lara, stop this shit, please!

814
01:17:36,388 --> 01:17:39,516
You have to tell your mother!
- What?

815
01:17:39,557 --> 01:17:44,771
You have to tell your mother!
- Not because of me, but because of her!

816
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:51,444
Lara!
- What?

817
01:17:52,112 --> 01:17:54,823
Shit! Lara!

818
01:18:08,753 --> 01:18:13,341
The life in our little country
became ever faster.

819
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:18,847
Somehow we were all just like atoms
in a big particle accelerator.

820
01:18:18,847 --> 01:18:21,349
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

821
01:18:21,349 --> 01:18:22,851
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

822
01:18:22,892 --> 01:18:29,107
silence and leisureliness,
where I could finally have a lie-in.

823
01:18:30,734 --> 01:18:36,948
Well, Paula. Alex didn't use to be
so tired when he came home from work.

824
01:18:44,623 --> 01:18:47,751
Our Paula's learning to walk, Alex!

825
01:18:53,423 --> 01:18:55,300
There! There!

826
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,988
There!

827
01:19:21,826 --> 01:19:24,955
See? I can do it, too.

828
01:19:34,923 --> 01:19:37,634
Paula! See?

829
01:19:40,553 --> 01:19:45,350
My little Paula. Come to your Granny.
Come, come.

830
01:19:49,854 --> 01:19:54,025
Now we'll show Alex,
what we can do, okay?

831
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:56,528
Right...

832
01:20:03,076 --> 01:20:07,247
Now let's see just how far
your Granny can walk.

833
01:21:00,675 --> 01:21:03,386
Hi! - Hi!
- Good afternoon.

834
01:21:16,483 --> 01:21:20,111
Young man,
can I just sit down for a moment here please?

835
01:21:20,153 --> 01:21:22,864
Of course.

836
01:21:30,997 --> 01:21:35,085
You're not from here, are you?
- Nope, from Wuppertal.

837
01:21:35,126 --> 01:21:37,212
From the West?

838
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:48,283
Mum?

839
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:52,389
Mum, what are you doing? Come on.
- Mum!

840
01:23:53,431 --> 01:23:59,354
What is it with you?
You can't just get up! Shit.

841
01:24:03,316 --> 01:24:06,319
What's actually happening here?

842
01:24:10,115 --> 01:24:14,286
Central Committee of the Socialist...
Unity Party of...

843
01:24:15,578 --> 01:24:18,290
Germany.

844
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:22,294
Sound is in order.
- Right.

845
01:24:22,627 --> 01:24:26,214
Right. I'm ready.
- Camera running.

846
01:24:26,256 --> 01:24:28,341
3, 2, 1...

847
01:24:30,385 --> 01:24:32,387
Berlin.

848
01:24:41,896 --> 01:24:43,940
Still running.

849
01:24:43,982 --> 01:24:45,859
Berlin.

850
01:24:46,067 --> 01:24:51,156
In a historic special session of the
Central Committee of the Social Unity Party of Germany...

851
01:24:51,197 --> 01:24:56,202
the General Secretary of the SUG's CC
and Chairman of the GDR's Council of State,

852
01:24:56,244 --> 01:25:00,540
Comrade Erich Honecker, in a great matter of humanitarian politeness,

853
01:25:00,582 --> 01:25:07,422
consented to the entering of the country by people from the FRG
who've been requesting exile at the GDR embassies in Prague and Budapest.

854
01:25:07,464 --> 01:25:09,507
In this development, Honecker sees...

855
01:25:09,549 --> 01:25:11,968
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

856
01:25:11,968 --> 01:25:13,928
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

857
01:25:13,928 --> 01:25:16,932
a welcome money of 200 East Marks.

858
01:25:16,932 --> 01:25:20,936
Unemployment,
bad future prospects...

859
01:25:20,936 --> 01:25:24,940
and the increasing election victories
of the neo-Nazi Republicans...

860
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:29,319
made the unnerved FRG citizens
turn their backs

861
01:25:29,361 --> 01:25:33,490
on the capitalism to
try and start...

862
01:25:33,531 --> 01:25:37,285
a new life in the country of workers and farmers.

863
01:25:39,788 --> 01:25:43,833
Here they park,
the new GDR citizens from the FRG.

864
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:48,088
The entering FRG citizens
were accommodated in the Berlin districts...

865
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:52,258
"Center" und "Friedrich's Grove".
The CC of the SUG...

866
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:57,889
created the campaign "Solidarity West"
because of the historic situation,

867
01:25:57,931 --> 01:26:02,686
to make sure all the new citizens
receive proper living space.

868
01:26:02,727 --> 01:26:06,856
Somehow I have to admit
that my game started to break free.

869
01:26:06,898 --> 01:26:11,027
Maybe the GDR I created for my mother,
was the one I would have liked to have.

870
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:15,198
Citizens who are ready
to accommodate a refugee from the FRG,

871
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:19,911
please report to their
Section Plenipotentiary.

872
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:24,833
How many are there already?

873
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:28,211
I don't know. Ten, twenty thousand?

874
01:26:28,795 --> 01:26:32,924
Look at that.
The people want to come into our country.

875
01:26:32,966 --> 01:26:37,095
Where are they all going to live?
- They'll find something.

876
01:26:37,137 --> 01:26:40,265
You've heard it, they're taking care of it.

877
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,770
No, children. This is our responsibility.
We have to help.

878
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:51,318
But how do you think we can?
I mean, there's no room left in here.

879
01:26:52,861 --> 01:26:55,989
Our holiday home.
- Our holiday home?

880
01:26:57,073 --> 01:27:02,287
We could do it up.
I wanted to get out there anyway.

881
01:27:02,996 --> 01:27:09,461
Congratulations. You've done a great job.
Now she wants to go to the holiday home.

882
01:27:11,004 --> 01:27:15,133
You'll have to redecorate the entire City.
Why don't you start?

883
01:27:15,175 --> 01:27:19,346
But I'm telling you one thing,
I won't take this any further.

884
01:27:21,514 --> 01:27:27,646
Ariane and I'll get a bigger apartment.
In 4 weeks we're out of here.

885
01:27:27,687 --> 01:27:30,065
What?

886
01:27:30,106 --> 01:27:32,817
I'm pregnant.

887
01:27:37,948 --> 01:27:42,118
Again?
Can't you be more careful?

888
01:27:44,287 --> 01:27:47,415
Don't you think Paula is enough? And Mum?

889
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:53,546
You can't leave me alone!
- Then take some refugees.

890
01:27:53,588 --> 01:27:57,759
You're so cynical.
You want her to die, don't you?

891
01:28:07,227 --> 01:28:12,649
And so the unity of our little
family was restored.

892
01:28:15,151 --> 01:28:18,280
That's your child. And this is the heart.

893
01:28:23,827 --> 01:28:26,538
Amazing!

894
01:28:27,038 --> 01:28:30,208
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

895
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,626
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

896
01:28:31,626 --> 01:28:35,630
were signed.
In Moskow, they calculated

897
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:41,636
that 2 and 4 equals one and drank
Krim Champagne to all-German brotherhood.

898
01:28:41,886 --> 01:28:47,309
In Berlin we took our
first all-German trip.

899
01:28:50,604 --> 01:28:54,733
I'm not a little child anymore.
Please take off the cloth.

900
01:28:54,774 --> 01:28:57,485
Don't look!

901
01:28:58,153 --> 01:29:02,324
Where are we going?
- The surprise stays a surprise!

902
01:29:03,116 --> 01:29:07,245
The Trabbi (GDR car) smells so new.
What colour does it have?

903
01:29:07,287 --> 01:29:12,459
You've waited 3 years,
another half an hour won't make a difference. - That's right.

904
01:29:44,658 --> 01:29:46,534
Mum?

905
01:30:02,217 --> 01:30:05,720
Oh, it's beautiful. Sky-blue.

906
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,723
Right, and now turn around.

907
01:30:12,602 --> 01:30:16,439
Oh my god. The garden.

908
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:20,735
Remember the time Alex
locked himself in the bathroom?

909
01:30:20,735 --> 01:30:23,738
We knocked and knocked. Not a sound.

910
01:30:23,738 --> 01:30:25,240
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

911
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,076
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

912
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:32,289
And I laughed so hard,
I wet myself.

913
01:30:39,212 --> 01:30:44,050
What's happened in the 8 months
I overslept?

914
01:30:44,092 --> 01:30:46,803
Is she asleep? - Yeah.

915
01:30:50,682 --> 01:30:54,853
You've become adults,
that must be it.

916
01:30:55,604 --> 01:30:57,397
You look more and more like your father.

917
01:30:57,397 --> 01:30:58,773
You look more and more like your father.

918
01:31:07,282 --> 01:31:08,783
Mum...

919
01:31:08,992 --> 01:31:13,121
I've lied to you all this time.
It's all different from what you think.

920
01:31:13,163 --> 01:31:16,291
Mum, what are you talking about?
- Your father...

921
01:31:21,504 --> 01:31:25,675
Your father didn't stay in the West
because of another woman.

922
01:31:26,384 --> 01:31:30,555
I lied.
And I also lied about...

923
01:31:34,726 --> 01:31:37,729
not hearing anything from him again.

924
01:31:38,313 --> 01:31:41,441
He wrote letters to me... and to you.

925
01:31:42,651 --> 01:31:46,404
They're all... in the kitchen cupboard.

926
01:31:53,578 --> 01:31:58,375
They made things so hard for him.
Just because he wasn't in the party.

927
01:31:58,416 --> 01:32:03,213
It was dreadful.
He didn't let anyone notice.

928
01:32:04,547 --> 01:32:07,550
But I knew.

929
01:32:07,676 --> 01:32:11,846
I... knew
and I couldn't help him.

930
01:32:14,766 --> 01:32:19,562
And then... there suddenly was
this congress in West Berlin.

931
01:32:21,147 --> 01:32:24,901
We only had 2 days to think.

932
01:32:26,278 --> 01:32:30,282
Your father wanted to stay in
the West and I...

933
01:32:30,323 --> 01:32:33,451
I was supposed to follow with you.

934
01:32:37,914 --> 01:32:41,042
Well, I couldn't do it.

935
01:32:44,296 --> 01:32:47,424
I... I was very frightened.

936
01:32:49,384 --> 01:32:53,513
You don't know, how it is.
Filling in an exit permit...

937
01:32:53,555 --> 01:32:58,101
with 2 children. You can't get out immediately.
You have to wait - endlessly!

938
01:32:58,143 --> 01:33:01,271
Sometimes even years. And you...

939
01:33:02,355 --> 01:33:06,526
They could have taken you away from me.
Do you understand?

940
01:33:13,158 --> 01:33:16,161
Yes.

941
01:33:17,329 --> 01:33:20,457
I didn't go.

942
01:33:22,834 --> 01:33:26,463
It was the worst mistake of my life.

943
01:33:26,504 --> 01:33:29,215
I know that now.

944
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:34,304
I lied to you. Please forgive me!

945
01:33:56,451 --> 01:33:59,454
My dear Robert...

946
01:34:01,414 --> 01:34:04,542
I thought about you so often...

947
01:34:06,544 --> 01:34:10,298
I would so much like to
see you once more.

948
01:34:50,046 --> 01:34:54,217
The same evening
mother's condition suddenly worsened.

949
01:36:03,662 --> 01:36:07,874
Your mother had another heart attack,
just as I feared.

950
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:12,087
At the moment, she's relatively stable.
But I'm afraid...

951
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:18,051
we have to expect the worst.
I'm sorry.

952
01:36:25,642 --> 01:36:29,771
The doctors can be wrong.
- Alex, don't lie to yourself.

953
01:36:29,813 --> 01:36:33,858
Here, I found it.
He lives in Wannlake.

954
01:36:36,695 --> 01:36:42,909
I know, it's her last wish.
But I couldn't bring myself to go there.

955
01:36:46,621 --> 01:36:49,624
Mum's not going to die.

956
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:55,088
Bye.

957
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:37,964
Now you can accommodate someone after all.

958
01:37:40,884 --> 01:37:43,595
Accommodate? Who?

959
01:37:43,845 --> 01:37:46,848
Someone from the West.

960
01:38:10,622 --> 01:38:13,333
You have to sleep.

961
01:38:16,169 --> 01:38:20,215
If you want you you can sleep
lie down in the nurses' room.

962
01:38:59,421 --> 01:39:02,549
There he was. The idol of my youth.

963
01:39:03,008 --> 01:39:05,260
Like a conjured spirit
from my childhood: Sigmund Jähn.

964
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,596
Like a conjured spirit
of my childhood Sigmund Jähn.

965
01:39:07,596 --> 01:39:13,101
He didn't give autographs, he didn't
talk to Pioneers about the secrets of the universe,

966
01:39:13,101 --> 01:39:17,105
the freedom you have in zero gravity
or the eternity of the cosmos.

967
01:39:17,272 --> 01:39:22,444
He drove a small, stinking Lada-Taxi.
- Where do you want to go?

968
01:39:22,485 --> 01:39:25,572
To Wannlake.
- I know what you're thinking.

969
01:39:25,614 --> 01:39:29,659
That's what many people think.
But that's not who I am.

970
01:39:29,784 --> 01:39:33,913
We were flying through the night.
Just like through the depths of the cosmos.

971
01:39:33,955 --> 01:39:38,084
Light-years away from the solar system,
past strange galaxies...

972
01:39:38,126 --> 01:39:42,297
with unknown lifeforms,
we landed in Wannlake.

973
01:39:42,589 --> 01:39:45,717
Could you wait a moment?

974
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,932
I won't be long.

975
01:40:02,233 --> 01:40:05,236
Good evening.
- Hello. Come in.

976
01:40:08,782 --> 01:40:12,535
Is Mr. Kerner there?
- The buffet is outside. - Over there.

977
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,211
Hello.

978
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:32,138
Good evening.

979
01:40:38,603 --> 01:40:40,480
Hello! Good evening!

980
01:40:44,192 --> 01:40:46,069
Hello!

981
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:58,164
Sandman, dear Sandman,
it isn't time yet...

982
01:40:58,206 --> 01:41:02,585
We send the evening greetings...

983
01:41:03,003 --> 01:41:06,464
before all the children have to go to bed.

984
01:41:06,548 --> 01:41:07,465
You surely have time left.

985
01:41:07,465 --> 01:41:09,718
You surely have time left.

986
01:41:12,721 --> 01:41:16,224
Hello.
- Hello. - Hello.

987
01:41:16,224 --> 01:41:19,728
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

988
01:41:19,728 --> 01:41:20,270
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

989
01:41:20,312 --> 01:41:23,023
Alexander.

990
01:41:28,653 --> 01:41:32,699
Look,
today the sandman is an astronaut.

991
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:36,328
Where I come from it's called cosmonaut.

992
01:41:36,369 --> 01:41:40,415
Where do you come from?
- From a different country.

993
01:41:43,251 --> 01:41:46,338
Hi, you little bears.
- Hello, Dad.

994
01:41:46,379 --> 01:41:49,382
Hello. How are you?

995
01:41:49,549 --> 01:41:52,260
Fine.

996
01:41:54,804 --> 01:41:57,933
So, are you also a fan of the Sandman?

997
01:41:58,016 --> 01:42:00,727
Yes, I am.

998
01:42:04,522 --> 01:42:08,693
Excuse me, do we know each other?
- Yes, we do.

999
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:13,823
Yes. I can't think of it.
Please help me.

1000
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,952
His name's Alexander.

1001
01:42:24,542 --> 01:42:26,211
Alex?

1002
01:42:29,631 --> 01:42:34,803
Robert. Robert!
We're all waiting for you out here.

1003
01:42:34,844 --> 01:42:37,430
Robert, come out!

1004
01:42:37,472 --> 01:42:42,102
Robert, we all know that you like to hide
in the bathroom on these occasions.

1005
01:42:48,316 --> 01:42:52,737
Dad, you have to give your speech.
- Robert, come out here.

1006
01:42:52,779 --> 01:42:55,782
I'll be back.

1007
01:43:00,912 --> 01:43:05,083
Oh, I see him.
You've kept us waiting.

1008
01:43:06,376 --> 01:43:09,379
Onto the stage!

1009
01:43:14,342 --> 01:43:18,847
Well, I thank you
all for coming here.

1010
01:43:18,847 --> 01:43:21,349
Thank you and...

1011
01:43:23,351 --> 01:43:24,853
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1012
01:43:24,853 --> 01:43:26,605
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1013
01:43:36,906 --> 01:43:41,036
I'm sorry for having this
party here tonight.

1014
01:43:41,077 --> 01:43:44,831
Had I known you'd come, I...

1015
01:43:48,376 --> 01:43:52,505
Strange, I've always thought you've got
a swimming pool.

1016
01:43:52,547 --> 01:43:58,470
We've got a lake nearby.
My god, I didn't even recognize you.

1017
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:08,813
Now I got 2 new brothers and sisters, hm?

1018
01:44:17,572 --> 01:44:22,953
For 3 years, every day I waited
for a message from you.

1019
01:44:22,994 --> 01:44:24,871
Every day.

1020
01:44:26,331 --> 01:44:30,085
It was my most fervent wish.

1021
01:44:41,263 --> 01:44:44,266
Why have you come?

1022
01:44:49,896 --> 01:44:52,899
Mum's dying.

1023
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:57,153
She had a heart attack.

1024
01:44:57,946 --> 01:45:00,949
She wants to see you once more.

1025
01:45:17,632 --> 01:45:20,760
What was it like up there?
- Up there?

1026
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,851
Oh... up there.

1027
01:45:30,729 --> 01:45:33,732
It was wonderful up there.

1028
01:45:34,357 --> 01:45:37,485
Just very far away from home.

1029
01:45:44,117 --> 01:45:48,288
The Wall is no more.
There's no frontier!

1030
01:45:49,164 --> 01:45:51,791
It's not that bad.
It's all just one country now!

1031
01:45:52,584 --> 01:45:56,755
I don't understand a word. It's all untrue.
- That's why you have to play along.

1032
01:45:57,672 --> 01:46:00,759
And why did I come back to the GDR?

1033
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,554
I don't know. Just think of something!

1034
01:46:08,266 --> 01:46:11,394
No, it's absurd. I can't do that.

1035
01:46:11,436 --> 01:46:16,232
You just have to overcome it,
then it'll be easy.

1036
01:46:41,466 --> 01:46:44,177
Mum.
- Yes.

1037
01:46:44,594 --> 01:46:46,471
Ouch.

1038
01:47:12,998 --> 01:47:15,709
I want to get up.

1039
01:47:16,209 --> 01:47:18,920
How do I look?

1040
01:47:28,555 --> 01:47:31,266
You can go in now.

1041
01:47:33,935 --> 01:47:37,689
And please remember, not a word!
- Yes, yes.

1042
01:47:48,033 --> 01:47:53,455
What did you talk about?
- Is that important?

1043
01:48:08,845 --> 01:48:13,016
How long has he been in there?
- More than an hour.

1044
01:48:17,395 --> 01:48:20,523
I hope he doesn't let the cat out of the bag.

1045
01:48:23,652 --> 01:48:29,574
The summer was over. I decided to end
the whole sham.

1046
01:48:29,908 --> 01:48:34,871
But once more we were about
to celebrate the anniversary of our socialist Fatherland.

1047
01:48:34,913 --> 01:48:39,626
But in contrast to reality...
as a dignified farewell.

1048
01:48:53,265 --> 01:48:54,891
Pst!

1049
01:49:04,025 --> 01:49:07,153
Yes? Camera running. Start at 3.

1050
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:18,581
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1051
01:49:18,623 --> 01:49:22,752
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1052
01:49:22,794 --> 01:49:25,422
from the depths of the cosmos...

1053
01:49:37,225 --> 01:49:41,646
As mum hardly couldn't wait,
we simply moved the GDR's anniversary...

1054
01:49:41,688 --> 01:49:47,110
from October 7 to October 2, 1990:
The eve of the reunification.

1055
01:50:08,757 --> 01:50:10,425
And?

1056
01:50:10,842 --> 01:50:13,970
Here. My best film yet, buddy.

1057
01:50:14,179 --> 01:50:18,308
Too bad no one but your mother
will ever see it.

1058
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:22,479
Thank you, Denis. Without you, it would never...
- Yeah, it's alright. Here you go.

1059
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:25,649
Zoom off, before it gets sentimental.

1060
01:50:26,483 --> 01:50:28,735
And tell me how it was!

1061
01:50:28,777 --> 01:50:34,032
On the occasion of today's annual anniversary of the GDR,
Erich Honecker resigned...

1062
01:50:34,074 --> 01:50:37,077
from all his functions.

1063
01:50:37,243 --> 01:50:38,912
What?

1064
01:50:38,995 --> 01:50:43,333
We ensure our friends in the world
that the socialism...

1065
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:47,504
(Reporter) In his speech on the ceremony for
the GDR's anniversary...

1066
01:50:47,545 --> 01:50:51,675
in the Republic's palace, Erich Honecker
justified his decision by saying that

1067
01:50:51,716 --> 01:50:55,845
the changes achieved in the GDR in the past few months...

1068
01:50:55,887 --> 01:51:00,016
completed his political life's work.
Erich Honecker congratulated...

1069
01:51:00,058 --> 01:51:05,230
the new SED's CC General Secretary and
Chairman of the GDR's council of state:

1070
01:51:05,272 --> 01:51:08,275
Sigmund Jähn.
- What, Jähn?

1071
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:13,822
In 1978, Sigmund Jähn was the first German
cosmonaut in space.

1072
01:51:14,447 --> 01:51:19,869
The new head of state addressed the
GDR's population in the evening.

1073
01:51:21,746 --> 01:51:27,961
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1074
01:51:28,211 --> 01:51:32,340
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1075
01:51:32,382 --> 01:51:37,804
from the depths of the cosmos,
you see things differently.

1076
01:51:39,055 --> 01:51:41,433
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1077
01:51:41,433 --> 01:51:43,351
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1078
01:51:43,351 --> 01:51:48,857
seem small and insignificant. You ask yourself
what humanity has accomplished.

1079
01:51:48,857 --> 01:51:53,361
Which objectives did we set,
which objectives did we realize?

1080
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:56,656
Today is our country's anniversary.

1081
01:51:56,698 --> 01:52:00,493
It's a very little country,
seen from the cosmos.

1082
01:52:00,535 --> 01:52:04,664
But still thousands of people
came to us last year.

1083
01:52:04,706 --> 01:52:10,003
People who we looked to as enemies and
who want to live here with us today.

1084
01:52:10,045 --> 01:52:15,091
We know our country is not perfect.
But what we believe in,

1085
01:52:15,133 --> 01:52:19,262
inspired a lot of people
in the whole world.

1086
01:52:19,304 --> 01:52:23,433
Maybe we have drifted off course
from time to time.

1087
01:52:23,475 --> 01:52:27,604
But we collected ourselves.
Socialism doesn't mean

1088
01:52:27,646 --> 01:52:32,275
living behind a wall. Socialism means
reaching out to others,

1089
01:52:32,317 --> 01:52:36,988
and living with others. Not just to dream
about a better world,

1090
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:39,074
but to make the world a better place.

1091
01:52:39,074 --> 01:52:40,909
but making it a better world.

1092
01:52:40,909 --> 01:52:44,913
I have therefore decided
to open the GDR borders.

1093
01:52:46,414 --> 01:52:50,418
Shortly after the Fall of the Wall,
thousands of FRG citizens...

1094
01:52:50,669 --> 01:52:55,465
seized the opportunity
to visit the GDR for the first time.

1095
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:04,099
Many want to stay. They're looking
for an alternative to...

1096
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:09,312
the hard battle for survival in the capitalistic system.
- Isn't that wonderful?

1097
01:53:09,354 --> 01:53:13,483
Not everyone wants to join in with career addiction and
aggressive marketing.

1098
01:53:13,525 --> 01:53:17,696
Not everyone wants
to fight his way through life.

1099
01:53:21,866 --> 01:53:25,912
(Song) Such a day,
so wonderful like today...

1100
01:53:26,538 --> 01:53:30,834
These people want a different life.
They realize that cars,

1101
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:35,880
video recorders and TVs are not everything.
They are ready to

1102
01:53:35,922 --> 01:53:41,845
realize a new life with nothing but
good will, vigour and hope.

1103
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,977
Amazing.

1104
01:55:01,967 --> 01:55:05,720
My mother survived the GDR
by 3 days.

1105
01:55:06,137 --> 01:55:10,267
I guess it was the right thing,
that she never did learn the truth.

1106
01:55:10,308 --> 01:55:13,311
She died happily.

1107
01:55:14,896 --> 01:55:19,025
She wished for us to
scatter her ashes to the four winds.

1108
01:55:19,067 --> 01:55:24,990
That's not allowed in Germany.
Not in the West and not in the East. But we didn't care.

1109
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:04,487
Up there she is floating and
maybe she is looking down at us.

1110
01:56:04,529 --> 01:56:08,658
And sees us as tiny
dots on our little Earth.

1111
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:11,828
Just like Sigmund Jähn back then.

1112
01:56:13,913 --> 01:56:20,128
The country my mother left
was a country she had believed in

1113
01:56:20,503 --> 01:56:24,674
and which we kept alive
until her last second.

1114
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:29,721
A country that in fact never existed like this.

1115
01:56:31,431 --> 01:56:37,646
A country that in my memory
will always be connected to my mother.
