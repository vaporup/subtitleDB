My name is Jack Crabb,

3
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:27,440
and I am the sole white survivor
of the Battle of Little Bighorn,

4
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:34,699
popularly known
as Custer's Last Stand.

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,700
Well, Mr Crabb,

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,367
I'm more interested in the primitive
lifestyle of the Plains Indian

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,621
than I am in...

8
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:52,006

9
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,088
Tall tales?

10
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,506
Are you calling me a liar?

11
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,768
No, no. It's just that...

12
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:08,895
I'm interested in the way of life
of the Indian,

13
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:12,851
rather than, shall we say, adventure.

14
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:20,860
You think the Battle of Little Bighorn
was an adventure?

15
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:27,080
Little Bighorn was not representative

16
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:32,164
of encounters between
whites and Indians, Mr Crabb.

17
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:36,255
You see, the near genocide
of the Indian...

18
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,883
- The near what?
- Near genocide.

19
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,508
It means...

20
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,809
...extermination.

21
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,276
The killing off of an entire people.

22
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:55,397
That's practically
what we did to the Indian.

23
00:01:55,573 --> 00:02:01,326
But, of course, I wouldn't expect
an old Indian fighter, like you,

24
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:03,617

25

- Turn that thing on.
- Pardon?

26
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:13,504
I said, turn that thing on
and shut up.

in that Indian camp all alone.

But the Cheyenne, who call
themselves the Human Beings,

had no idea to hurt me.

You see, the Human Beings
adopted me as one of their own.

like Burns Red,

grandpa, Old Lodge Skins.

"If you will quit fighting,
we will let you go."

But Little Man answered,
"It's a good day to die."

Finally, they cut off his head,

112

00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,752
Not that the Human Being
wasn't brave.

176
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,831
No warrior ever walked the earth
more brave than a Human Being.

177
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:22,761
But Old Lodge Skins' idea of war
was different from the whites'

178
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:25,474
Half our party didn't use weapons.

179
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:29,692
They "took coup",
hit the enemy with a little stick.

180
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:34,109
Humiliate them.
That was how a Human Being

181
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:37,234
taught a coward a lesson
and won a war.

182
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,567
Shadow!

183
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:53,756
Repeating rifles
against bow and arrow.

184
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:58,219
I never understood how the whites
could be so proud of winning

185
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:01,424
with them kind of odds.

186
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:06,271
Yee... argh...!

187
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:20,570
God bless George Washington!

188
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,489
Before I knowed it,
them words popped out.

189
00:22:24,664 --> 00:22:26,822
God bless my mother!

190
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:33,378
You murdering fool!

191
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,834
Do I have to cut your throat
before you see I'm white?

192
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:41,799
- White?
- Sure I'm white.

193
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:48,094
Didn't I say, "God bless Washington
and my mother"?

194
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:51,971
What kind of Indian would say
a fool thing like that?

195
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,732
Lend me that to get off this paint.

196
00:22:57,364 --> 00:23:00,815
The troopers took me
and turned me over

197
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:04,158
to the Reverend Silas Pendrake,

198
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:08,029
for moral guidance
and a Christian upbringing.

199
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:12,157
- Can you drive a buggy, boy?
- Oh, yes, sir. I can do it.

200
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,828
You're a liar, boy.

201
00:23:15,006 --> 00:23:19,169
If you was reared by the Indians,
how could you learn to drive a buggy?

202
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:22,297
We shall have to beat
the lying out of you.

203
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:26,932
(MUSIC: DOLEFUL HARMONICA)

204
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:41,028
Dear Jack.

205
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,702
Welcome to your new home.

206
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,986
Your travail is over,

207
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:52,031
enfolded now as you are
in Christian love.

208
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,710
Well, boy, are you unable to converse?

209
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:03,544
- No, I'm glad to meet your daughter.
- You are addressing my wife.

210
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:08,555
Poor boy. Poor darling.

211
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:12,593
Think of the years of suffering,
deprivation and hardship

212
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,930
among those awful savages.

213
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:21,190
The boy's deprivation, my dear,
has been more spiritual than physical.

214
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:25,692
The Indians know nothing
of God and moral right.

215
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:32,748
They eat human flesh,
fornicate, adulterise, misogynise

216
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:37,412
and commune constantly
with minions of the devil.

217
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:41,965
It must be our task...
nay, our Christian duty,

218
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,760
- to beat the misery out.
- Beat the poor boy?

219
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,760
- Not while there's breath in my body.
- I could have kissed her.

220
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:52,602
I didn't mean beat him literally.

221
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:56,019
I meant beat him symbolically.

222
00:24:56,189 --> 00:25:01,100
Poor boy. He hasn't
even had a proper bath.

223
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,441
- I detect the odour of food.
- I shall wash this poor boy.

224
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:07,654
It's supper time.

225
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:13,033
It is my Christian duty to give
this boy an immediate, thorough bath.

226
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:15,957
- Take your clothes off.
- Off?

227
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:18,795
- Yes.
- All of them?

228
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:25,334
Every stitch. But I shall avert
my eyes at the necessary moment.

230

(CONTINUES HYMN - HUMMING)

237
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:13,557
You do realise, don't you, dear Jack,

238
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:17,805
that the Reverend Pendrake
is not altogether wrong?

239
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:21,478
What? I mean, what, ma'am?

240
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:25,523
Well, Jesus is your saviour.

241
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,151
- You do realise that, don't you?
- Oh, Lordy. Yes, Mrs Pendrake.

242
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,651
Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?

243
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:37,664
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

244
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:40,405
- You mustn't fib to me.
- Oh, no.

245
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:43,704
I love Jesus and Moses
and all of them.

246
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:47,837
There's quite a difference.

247
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:51,128
Moses was a Hebrew,

248
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:56,723
but Jesus was a Gentile,
like you and me.

249
00:26:57,643 --> 00:27:00,015
Ain't you done washing that boy yet?

250
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:03,390
I'm giving the child
religious instruction.

251
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,642
I want to eat.

252
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,819
Looks like a well-growed child,
if you ask me.

253
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:19,033
All right now, dear. Please stand up
and let me dry you off.

254
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:22,123
I shall avert my eyes, of course.

255
00:27:26,755 --> 00:27:29,246
Now step out of the tub.

256
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,430
Actually,
you are rather well-grown, Jack.

257
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:46,054
You're small, but... nice-looking.

258
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:49,434
Did you know that?

259
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:52,945
- No, ma'am.
- Well, you are.

260
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:57,776
All the more reason for you
to receive religious instruction.

261
00:27:57,953 --> 00:28:02,081
The girls, I'm sure,
will all be after you.

262
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:04,953
- And, Jack...
- Ma'am?

263
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:08,794
That way lies madness.

264
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:11,170
What way, ma'am?

265
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:19,678
You'll understand these things better
when you're older.

266
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:28,058
The point is, my dear boy,
that we all must resist temptation.

267
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:33,647
Purity is its own reward.

268
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:38,734
Dear Jack...

269
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,515
Welcome to your new home.

270
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:05,427
(BREATHLESS) Now dress...

271
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:08,845
...and come in to supper.

272
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:15,690
I went to school and learned all over
how to read and write and cipher.

273
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:17,939
It was strange at first,

274
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:21,151
but Mrs Pendrake tutored me
and I learned fast.

275
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,612
But there was one thing
I didn't know about

276
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,280
and that was a thing called sin.

277
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,329
I caught you at the gates of hell!

278
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:35,627
Boy, the hand of God
must smite the carcass of man.

279
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:40,214
It's worth it, dear Jack.

280
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:45,927
It's worth it a million times over
to be pure and good,

281
00:29:46,102 --> 00:29:49,305
to walk in the paths of righteousness.

282
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,016
There's no happiness like it.

283
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:56,395
Do you believe me, Jack?
Do you believe me?

284
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,938
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.

# Amazing grace... #

286
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:06,068
So it was
I entered my religion period.

287
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:10,077
I was a great little hymn singer,
and I wasn't fooling.

288
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,372
I'd been saved.

289
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,790
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

290
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:21,425
O Lord, look down upon this poor boy
who lived among the heathen

291
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:25,924
and cleanse him of the corruption
of their foul, pagan ways

292
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,257
and make him white
again as the snow.

293
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:32,100
Let him be reborn
and repurified in thy name.

294
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:36,139
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

295
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:37,693
Amen.

296
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:43,612
Mrs Pendrake was right
about temptation.

297
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:47,035
I'd have nothing to do
with them Jezebels.

298
00:30:48,497 --> 00:30:51,581
I told her about my triumph
over temptation,

299
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,961
and we read the Bible
for about an hour to celebrate.

300
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:03,715
As the weeks went by, I fell more
and more in love with Mrs Pendrake...

301
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:06,259
... spiritually, of course.

302
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,266
I shall be off for my shopping.

303
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:14,641
The boy's doing so poor these days,
why not take him along and air him?

304
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:19,143
- He'd be bored with the shopping.
- No, I wouldn't, ma'am.

305
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:23,903
All right, then.

was downright refreshing.

When I joined him, his left hand
and his left ear were already gone.

345
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:47,730
We might see a miracle,
one I have witnessed before.

346
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,521

has been proven...

Walk!

349
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:58,442
During my years with Meriweather,

350
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,201
he lost an eye
as a result of a fifth ace

351
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:05,539
dropping out his sleeve
in a poker game.

352
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:10,046
It didn't faze him, though.
Deception was his life's blood,

353
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:15,041
even if it caused him to get
whittled down kind of gradual like.

354
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:22,558
You're improving. You just can't seem
to get rid of that streak of honesty.

355
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:26,391
The one that ruined you
was that Indian, Old Tepee.

356
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:30,347
- You mean Old Lodge Skins?
- He gave you a vision

357
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:34,737
of moral order in the universe,
and there isn't any.

358
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:37,822
Those stars twinkle in a void,
dear boy,

359
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:43,827
and the two-legged creature schemes
and dreams beneath them, all in vain.

360
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,532
All in vain, Jack.

361
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:51,373
- You hear anything?
- Listen to me!

362
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:56,255
Men will believe anything,
the more preposterous the better.

363
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:59,925
Whales speak French
at the bottom of the sea.

364
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:04,550
The horses of Arabia
have silver wings.

365
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:07,762
Pygmies mate with elephants
in darkest Africa.

366
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:12,101
I have sold all those propositions.

367
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:26,360
Well, maybe we're all fools
and none of it matters.

368
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:29,790
Ah...

369
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:44,765
You stay with Allardyce Meriweather,
and you'll wear silk.

370
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:50,561
I don't know as I want to wear silk.

371
00:36:51,398 --> 00:36:56,059
My dear boy, what else can
a man of parts wear than silk?

372
00:36:56,236 --> 00:36:58,773
Tar and feathers, I reckon.

373
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:01,819
All right. Sit right there.

374
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:07,319
Don't make no moves unless you want
a little daylight in your liver.

What, may I ask, brings you out
into the wilds at this hour, sir?

376
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,708
- That them?
- Yes.

377
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:16,713
I've seen this young one before.

378
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:20,748
- I've never been in this country.
- You look familiar, bub.

379

Sir, please.
You're wasting precious medicine.

383
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:41,314
Seven folks are half-dead
because of this. What's in it?

384
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:43,777
Nothing harmful, I assure you.

385

- Mostly water.

- Licked?

396

I'm not licked.
I'm tarred and feathered, that's all.

- Throw up three.

of your family, Jack.

OK, now you.

411
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,985
I don't know anything about guns.

412
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:46,812
I never even carried none.

413
00:39:46,988 --> 00:39:51,151
Lord! What kind of upbringing
did them Indians give you?

414
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:56,746
Never carried no gun? Why,
a man ain't complete without a gun.

415
00:39:57,624 --> 00:40:00,577
- Go snake-eyed.
- Do what?

416
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:02,828

before you touch the gun.

421
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:23,936
How can I draw and shoot the gun
before I touch it?

422
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:26,812

Hot damn! Yeah.

424
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,537
Caroline was right.

425
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:48,875
It is possible to shoot a gun
before you touch it.

00:51:15,712 --> 00:51:18,962
Then take my advice. Go west.

517
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:22,631

540
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:42,750
Olga.

541
00:54:47,171 --> 00:54:49,543
I covered most of three states

542
00:54:49,715 --> 00:54:55,135
and hundreds of square miles
looking for Olga, with no luck at all.

543
00:54:56,222 --> 00:55:00,005
- Hey, Crabb.
- Whiskey, whiskey...

544
00:55:00,184 --> 00:55:04,015
For a drink of whiskey,
they'll give you a squaw.

545
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:06,892
Sure save you a lot of looking.

546
00:55:17,576 --> 00:55:21,276
I looked everywhere for my wife
but couldn't find her.

547
00:55:22,664 --> 00:55:26,957
Finally, I had to go deeper
into Cheyenne country,

548
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:29,914

it was dangerous,

549

once been a Human Being myself.

550
00:55:40,724 --> 00:55:43,131
- Kill him.
- I didn't steal, brother.

551
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,598
Why do you call me "brother"?

552
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:49,471
Don't. I am not your brother.
I am a Human Being.

553
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:54,310
I suppose you will say you have
never heard of Little Big Man.

554
00:55:57,073 --> 00:55:59,742
Little Big Man was my brother,

555
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,032
but you're not him.

556
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:05,786
He was killed
after rubbing out many bluecoats.

557
00:56:05,957 --> 00:56:08,282
Did you see the body?

558
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,960
No, he turned into a swallow
and flew away.

559
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:15,629
- Let's kill him.
- Shadow! You were shot.

560
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,670
I put you on a pony.
I saved you.

561
00:56:19,804 --> 00:56:23,967
Dirt On The Nose, do you still have
the pony I gave you?

562
00:56:24,142 --> 00:56:28,638
No. The Pawnee stole him when
we camped at the Old Woman Butte

563
00:56:28,813 --> 00:56:31,304
five snows ago.

564
00:56:40,408 --> 00:56:44,275
It is true there is a thing here
I do not understand.

565
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,913
There is a pain between my ears.

00:57:47,516 --> 00:57:51,383
Grandfather,
I brought you this present.

570
00:57:51,562 --> 00:57:53,887
Is this the hat I used to own,

571
00:57:55,274 --> 00:57:58,274
except grown softer of skin
and fatter?

572
00:57:58,444 --> 00:58:00,981
No, grandfather, it's another.

00:58:08,036 --> 00:58:10,527
We must smoke to your return.

574
00:58:19,756 --> 00:58:22,081
I saw you in a dream.

575
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:29,169
You were drinking from a spring that
came from the long nose of an animal.

576
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:32,266
I did not recognise the animal.

577
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:35,888
Alongside his nose, he grew two horns,

578
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:42,232
and the water that gushed
from his nose was full of air.

579
00:58:48,827 --> 00:58:51,496
I can't explain it,
but he was talking

580
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:55,494
about that elephant-head spigot
in the soda shop.

581
00:58:55,667 --> 00:59:02,380
This wasn't the only time Old Lodge
Skins had dreams that turned out true.

582

Don't be angry, my son, with
Burns Red, Shadow and the others.

583
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:13,174
They had many a bad experience
with the white man last year.

584
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:18,475
I have thought and talked
and smoked on this matter,

585
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:21,103
and my decision is...

586
00:59:23,153 --> 00:59:25,311

Little Big Man.

590
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:42,127
It was Little Horse, the boy
who didn't want to fight the Pawnee.

for which there ain't no English word.

595

- Hello, Younger Bear.
- Goodbye.

It was the boy whose life I'd saved,
to his mortal embarrassment.

600

on your hunting trip?

No.

Then don't give them
to Buffalo Wallow Woman.

603
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:53,733
You see, Younger Bear
had become a contrary,

of all Cheyenne warriors

drives them half-crazy,

Except for battle, a contrary
does everything backwards.

01:01:06,088 --> 01:01:09,539
He says "goodbye" for "hello",
"yes" for "no",

walks through bushes
instead of on trails,

609
01:01:13,095 --> 01:01:16,428
and washes with dirt
and dries with water.

Why have you come back
when nobody wants to see you?

612
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:30,769
You mustn't speak to Little Big Man
like that. You owe him a life.

613
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:36,565
I'm glad I said it. Hello.

614
01:01:36,743 --> 01:01:41,819
That was supposed to mean
he was sorry he said it, goodbye.

615
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:45,497
But that warrior wasn't sorry,
He hated me still.

616
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,790
Grandfather, I have a white wife.

617

You do?

618
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,920
That's interesting.

619
01:01:57,972 --> 01:02:00,048
Does she cook and work hard?

620
01:02:00,225 --> 01:02:02,466
Oh, yes, Grandfather.

621
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:04,720
That surprises me.

622
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,976
Does she show pleasant enthusiasm
when you mount her?

623
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:12,978
Well, sure, Grandfather.

624
01:02:13,154 --> 01:02:15,645
That surprises me even more.

625
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:18,658
I tried one of them once,

626
01:02:18,826 --> 01:02:22,526
but she didn't show
any enthusiasm at all.

Well, Grandfather,
all the whites aren't crazy.

628

01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,304
- I thought they were.
- Oh, no.

01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:48,601
I know of one who is as brave
as any Human Being.

631
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:52,897
I'd like to meet this man
and smoke with him.

632
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,357
What is he called?

633
01:02:55,529 --> 01:02:57,936
He's called General Custer.

634
01:02:58,115 --> 01:03:00,191
General Custer.

635
01:03:01,827 --> 01:03:06,370
- What does the name mean, my son?
- Well, it means...

636
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:12,951
..."long hair".
- Good name. How did he win it?

637
01:03:14,548 --> 01:03:19,174
He won it in the war of the whites
to free the black men.

638
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:23,047
Oh, yes.

639
01:03:23,224 --> 01:03:25,216
The black white men.

640
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:27,384
I know of them.

641
01:03:28,312 --> 01:03:32,179
It is said a black white man
once became a Human Being.

642
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,733
But mostly,
they are strange creatures.

643
01:03:38,072 --> 01:03:41,571
Not as ugly as the white, true,

644
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,861
but they're just as crazy.

645
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,670
Don't worry, my son.
You'll return to the Human Beings.

646
01:03:59,843 --> 01:04:02,416
I dreamed it last night.

647
01:04:02,596 --> 01:04:04,588
I saw you and your wives

648
01:04:04,765 --> 01:04:08,548
as you crawled from one to the other
in your tepee.

649
01:04:08,727 --> 01:04:13,969
- Wives, Grandfather?
- Oh, yes. Three or four.

650
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:17,980
It was dark, and they were hidden
under buffalo robes.

I don't know. It worries me.

I was sure I'd never see him again.

657
01:05:03,323 --> 01:05:08,150
Sir! I expect being a scout is
the best way to find my wife, General.

658
01:05:08,328 --> 01:05:12,491
She was captured
when we went west, like you advised.

659
01:05:12,665 --> 01:05:16,496
I advised? lmpossible.
I've never set eyes on you.

You wouldn't remember me, sir.

661
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:23,044
Furthermore, you don't look
like a scout to me. Not a bit.

662
01:05:23,217 --> 01:05:27,380
A scout has a certain appearance.
Kit Carson, for example.

663
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:30,306
But you don't have it.
You look like...

the strong arms.

668
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,025
- Isn't that correct?
- Well, I...

Yes, sir.

- Yes, sir.

694
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:40,700
It was downright discouraging.

695
01:08:40,871 --> 01:08:44,370
If it wasn't Indians
trying to kill me for a white,

696
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:47,708
it was whites
trying to kill me for an Indian.

697
01:08:51,549 --> 01:08:57,587
It made me sick. Pawnee scouts
and soldiers was killing everything.

I just took care of him.
I'm saving you for the hanging.

There is no describing how I felt.

705
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:50,179
An enemy had saved my life

706
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:54,271
by the violent murder
of one of my best friends.

707
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:58,947

even to bother to live in it.

(A CRY)

709
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:45,117
That was why Shadow was there
and that was why he'd fought so hard.

710
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:48,951
I sat and watched that baby
come into this world.

711
01:10:52,043 --> 01:10:55,376
Except for breathing,
that woman made no sound.

She didn't look more than a girl.

off of that girl and her baby,

- Sunshine.

Do you want to eat?

733
01:13:49,427 --> 01:13:51,336
Grandfather?

734
01:13:51,512 --> 01:13:54,085
What happened to your neck?

735
01:13:54,265 --> 01:13:56,506
It's a wound.

736
01:13:56,684 --> 01:14:01,262
It cut the tunnel through which
light travels to the heart.

737
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,983
You're... You mean you're blind?

Oh, no.

My eyes still see.

740
01:14:14,035 --> 01:14:17,486
But my heart no longer receives it.

741
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:22,580
How did it happen?

742
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,249

- Where's Buffalo Wallow Woman?
- Rubbed out.

And White Elk Woman, too,
and Dirt On The Nose, and High Wolf.

- And many others.
- And Burns Red?

Yes.

01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:51,853
- Burns Red In The Sun?
- Rubbed out.

Do you see this fine thing?

01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:17,429
Do you admire the humanity of it?

754
01:15:18,223 --> 01:15:21,389
Because the Human Beings, my son,

755
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,928
they believe everything is alive.

01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:27,940

757
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,311
but also water, earth, stone.

758
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:35,231
And also the things from them,

759
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:37,483
like that hair.

760
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:41,117
The man from whom this hair came,

761
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:44,783
he's bald on the other side,

762
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:48,077
because I now own his scalp.

763
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:53,296
That is the way things are.

764
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,544
But the white men,

765
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:01,804
they believe everything is dead:

766
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:05,426
stone, earth, animals,

767
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:09,470
and people, even their own people.

768
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:16,481
If things keep trying to live,
white men will rub them out.

769
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,991
That is the difference.

01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,583

773
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,689
A year later, I was still with them.

After wandering all over
in constant danger of being killed

775
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,370
by white settlers or white soldiers,

776
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:12,083
we come to a place knowed
as the Indian Nations.

777
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:16,713
It was a tract of land
by the Washita River

778
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:20,048
that had been give for ever
to the Indians

779
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:24,465
by the Congress and
the President of the United States.

780
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,967
We was safe there.

781
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,183
This was Indian land...

782
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:40,355
... as long as grass grow
and wind blow and the sky is blue.

783
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:48,068
Your new son's kicking a lot today.

784
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:52,037
I think he wants to come out
and see his father.

785
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:56,452
Tell him to wait
until I finish my dinner.

786
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:02,299
I'll tell him, but I don't think
he's going to wait much longer.

787
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:12,341
It's good I have a strong, brave
husband who brings in so much food.

788
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:19,276
My strong husband brings
in much more than we need.

789
01:18:36,336 --> 01:18:41,294
There are many Human Beings here,
many bands from many places.

790
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:46,424
But it's sad. Many husbands have
been rubbed out by the white man.

791
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,642
So women sleep alone and cry.

792
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,894
Be quiet now. I'm digesting.

793
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,315
Yes, but I think my sisters are here.

794
01:19:06,824 --> 01:19:08,900
Your what?

795
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:15,494
My sisters. Digging Bear, Little Elk
and Corn Woman. I think they're here.

796
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:18,536
What do you mean,
you "think" they're here?

797
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:23,456
I believe they are. You bring in
much more food than we need.

798
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:27,630
It is very sad. They have
no husbands and they cry.

799
01:19:27,803 --> 01:19:29,961
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

800
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:34,762
Digging Bear had a baby and lost it,
and so did Corn Woman.

801
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:40,559
- But Little Elk had no baby at all.
- What do you want me to do about it?

802
01:19:40,733 --> 01:19:43,650
I knew you'd understand.

803
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:07,126
It was Old Lodge Skins' dream,
trying to come true.

804
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:23,774
I was determined
to stay out of them buffalo robes.

805
01:20:25,152 --> 01:20:30,691
Three young and healthy women
with no man for who knows how long.

806
01:20:31,867 --> 01:20:37,027
The very idea kind of shrunk me
like a spider on a hot stove.

807
01:20:38,207 --> 01:20:40,283
Why, it's Little Big Man.

808
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:44,662
Oh, Little Big Man.

809
01:20:45,422 --> 01:20:48,873
Younger Bear, it's Little Big Man.

810
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:53,968
He's not a contrary any more.
He has a wife.

811
01:20:55,307 --> 01:20:59,850
She's plump, she works hard,
but she henpecks him.

812
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:03,887
Just when I think you're dead,
you always come back.

813
01:21:04,065 --> 01:21:08,525
Yes, and I always will,
till you pay me the life you owe me.

814
01:21:11,114 --> 01:21:13,071
I've heard you.

815
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:20,446
Now come to my tepee and eat.

816
01:21:20,624 --> 01:21:23,494
We was caught
in Cheyenne hospitality,

817
01:21:24,294 --> 01:21:27,709
I'm a very important man,
more important than you.

818
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:31,592
I have a wife and four horses.

819
01:21:32,594 --> 01:21:34,966
I have a horse and...

820
01:21:35,138 --> 01:21:37,177
...four wives.

821
01:21:39,142 --> 01:21:40,933
That may be,

822
01:21:41,102 --> 01:21:45,728
but my wife, she's a very good one.

823
01:21:47,191 --> 01:21:49,267
See?

824
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:55,654
Oh, so there you are,
you crawling coyote.

825
01:21:55,825 --> 01:21:59,075
What are we going to eat?
This starved duck?

826
01:22:02,248 --> 01:22:08,083
Oh! Who's the beggar you brought
to steal what little food we have?

827
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:10,293
Clean it! Clean it!

828
01:22:13,092 --> 01:22:16,674
It was Olga. I'd found her at last.

829
01:22:17,263 --> 01:22:18,922
One duck.

830
01:22:19,098 --> 01:22:24,092
Olga never did learn much English, but
she sure in hell had learned Cheyenne.

831
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,807
I just don't understand it.

832
01:22:27,607 --> 01:22:32,185
Usually, this woman
is gentle as a dove.

833
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:44,032
My words were not the words to
speak to a stranger. You stay and eat.

834
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:52,877
You see what a good wife she is?
It's because I'm a wonderful lover.

835
01:22:53,048 --> 01:22:55,373
Go in my tepee.
She will cook for you.

836
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:58,220
That's all right. I'm not hungry.

837
01:22:58,387 --> 01:23:01,222
(CRIES OUT)

838
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:03,883
You humiliated him again.

839
01:23:07,771 --> 01:23:10,059
Goodbye, Younger Bear.

840
01:23:16,196 --> 01:23:18,865
You look tired, Little Big Man.

841
01:23:19,032 --> 01:23:23,409
Do you want to come into my tepee
and rest on soft furs?

842
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:27,822
Why don't you live with me
and I'll be your wife?

843
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,491
Thank you for inviting me.

844
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:37,330
Well, I've got to fix my hair
to sing tonight.

845
01:23:38,385 --> 01:23:40,543
Goodbye, Little Big Man.

846
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:44,006
Goodbye, Little Horse.

847
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:49,221
And so I finally found Olga.

848
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:53,559
But I had lost her long ago
to the Human Beings

849
01:23:53,733 --> 01:23:58,193
and I saw no good reason
to reveal myself to her now.

850
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,275
Grandfather.

851
01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:07,450
Why have you moved your tepee
so far from our band?

852
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:10,658
The ponies are trying
to tell me something.

853
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,757
Last night I had a dream.

854
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:24,137
The ponies were dying.
I heard them scream.

855
01:24:27,517 --> 01:24:31,300
I'd learned to respect
Old Lodge Skins' dreams,

856
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:36,306
but for once we were in a safe place,
give to us by treaty,

857
01:25:01,217 --> 01:25:03,293
Why do you hate my sisters?

858
01:25:06,514 --> 01:25:08,590
I don't hate your sisters.

859
01:25:10,059 --> 01:25:12,181

01:46:38,293 --> 01:46:40,369
Hoss,

1029
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:45,380
you know that matter we discussed?

1030
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:48,041
- The widow?
- Yes, Bill.

1031
01:46:48,928 --> 01:46:51,632
Don't tell my wife.

1032
01:46:51,806 --> 01:46:54,759
That'd really get me in trouble.

1033
01:47:07,739 --> 01:47:11,487
You got me down
in this goddamn water.

1034
01:47:14,495 --> 01:47:17,032
- (BELL)
- You quit it right now.

1035
01:47:21,752 --> 01:47:26,081
Come in, stranger.
Whatever it is you want, we've got it.

1036
01:47:30,219 --> 01:47:32,295
Mrs Pendrake?

1037
01:47:42,898 --> 01:47:46,183
You've mistaken me
for someone else, stranger.

1038
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,269
My name is Lulu.

1039
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:54,980
Your name ain't Lulu.
You're Louise Pendrake.

1040
01:47:58,831 --> 01:48:03,243
- Who are you?
- Why, I'm Jack Crabb.

1041
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:09,621
Mrs Pendrake,
don't you remember me?

1042
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,876
Jack Crabb?

1043
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:16,674
My God.

1044
01:48:22,396 --> 01:48:24,887
Jack.

1045
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,149
This is quite a pleasant surprise.

1046
01:48:29,653 --> 01:48:34,361
This room is more commodious.
What have you been doing?

1047
01:48:34,533 --> 01:48:38,115
Lulu! What are you doing,
sitting on your arse?

1048
01:48:38,287 --> 01:48:42,118
- A gentleman is waiting.
- I have a gentleman here, too.

1049
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:44,742
Oh. I didn't see you, stranger.

1050
01:48:44,918 --> 01:48:48,500
Need anything?
If you do, just ring the bell.

1051
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:52,835
Our motto here is:
whatever you want, we've got it.

1052
01:49:01,685 --> 01:49:05,100
Well, Jack. Now you know.

1053
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:12,768
This is a house of ill fame,
and I'm a fallen flower.

1054
01:49:13,989 --> 01:49:17,571
That widow hadn't lost her style
one bit.

1055
01:49:17,742 --> 01:49:21,193
A fallen flower.
Chokes me up to think about it.

1056
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:25,288
This life is not only wicked
and sinful.

1057
01:49:26,209 --> 01:49:28,285
It isn't even any fun.

1058
01:49:29,254 --> 01:49:32,089
No, I reckon not, Mrs Pendrake.

1059
01:49:32,257 --> 01:49:36,753
Yet, if I was married and could
come here once or twice a week,

1060
01:49:36,928 --> 01:49:38,920
it might be fun.

1061
01:49:39,097 --> 01:49:41,718
But every night, it's just boring.

1062
01:49:41,891 --> 01:49:44,678
Oh, I can understand that.

1063
01:49:45,937 --> 01:49:48,059
I can't save any money.

1064
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:52,352
If I could just save a few dollars,

1065
01:49:52,527 --> 01:49:56,061
I could visit my maiden aunt
in Washington.

1066
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:59,192
I'd have clothes, a carriage...

1067
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:02,237
I might even marry a senator.

1068
01:50:02,411 --> 01:50:07,487
Oh! You'd make a good wife
for a senator, Mrs Pendrake.

1069
01:50:08,209 --> 01:50:11,577
You always were a sweet boy.

1070
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:21,883
Do you know, I often had
wicked thoughts about you?

1071
01:50:24,558 --> 01:50:26,634
Several times.

1072
01:50:27,353 --> 01:50:30,472
I almost gave in to temptation.

1073
01:50:30,648 --> 01:50:34,230
And now, here we are.

1074
01:50:40,699 --> 01:50:42,987
Mrs Pendrake, what are you doing?

1075
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:46,778
Do you know that, once,
I tiptoed into your room

1076
01:50:46,956 --> 01:50:50,159
and stood over you
for the longest time?

1077
01:50:50,751 --> 01:50:54,202
It was the most awful temptation
to wake you up.

1078
01:50:57,174 --> 01:50:59,546
I wish that I had.

1079
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:04,173
It would have been deliciously wicked.

1080
01:51:05,974 --> 01:51:08,215
Is anything the matter, Jack?

1081
01:51:08,894 --> 01:51:12,393
- No.
- Then I'll wait for you in the...

1082
01:51:13,982 --> 01:51:16,733
...place of retirement.

1083

(SPLUTTERS)

1084
01:51:37,464 --> 01:51:42,458
You should have woke me up
that night years ago, Mrs Pendrake.

1085
01:51:45,305 --> 01:51:47,463
This is from Wild Bill.

1086
01:51:47,641 --> 01:51:52,635
It was his last wish that you go
and live with your maiden aunt.

1087
01:51:54,064 --> 01:51:57,764
His last wish was to save me?

1088
01:52:02,864 --> 01:52:05,189
Oh, Jack.

1089
01:52:05,367 --> 01:52:07,443
I must honour that wish.

1090
01:52:08,078 --> 01:52:10,236
You can do it, Mrs Pendrake.

1091
01:52:10,413 --> 01:52:14,825
Yes. I can, and I will.

1092
01:52:15,585 --> 01:52:18,835
I've got to go now.
Goodbye, Mrs Pendrake.

1093
01:52:19,005 --> 01:52:21,460
Oh, goodbye, Jack.

1094
01:52:21,633 --> 01:52:24,503
And thank you ever so much.

1095
01:52:25,303 --> 01:52:27,509
And, Jack...

1096
01:52:29,891 --> 01:52:36,558
If you're ever in Washington,
do look me up.

(BARKING)

1098
01:52:47,867 --> 01:52:51,449
- How are things, Mr Meriweather?
- Splendid.

1099
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:59,450
Well, now, look at that.
Buffalo hides.

1100
01:52:59,629 --> 01:53:04,125
There's a world of money
chewing grass on those plains, Jack.

1101
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:07,170
There goes Buffalo Bill himself.

1102
01:53:09,889 --> 01:53:15,309
Yes, sir. Multiply that by thousands.
The buffalo are getting scarce.

1103
01:53:15,478 --> 01:53:19,558
You were raised by Indians.
You should know how to track them.

1104
01:53:19,732 --> 01:53:22,104
We could make a killing, Jack.

1105
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:37,618
- Haven't changed a bit, Jack.
- Neither have you.

1106
01:53:37,791 --> 01:53:41,835
You'd better watch out.
They're whittling you down.

1107
01:53:42,004 --> 01:53:45,622
You can't afford to lose
any more of your parts.

1108
01:53:45,799 --> 01:53:48,799
Every business has a particle of risk.

1109
01:53:48,969 --> 01:53:51,542
Bye, dear boy.

1110
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,728
That was my low.

1111
01:54:03,901 --> 01:54:06,308
I had reached the bottom.

1112
01:54:11,575 --> 01:54:13,697
I become a hermit.

1113
01:54:13,869 --> 01:54:18,530
I went deep in the wilderness,
as far away as I could get.

1114
01:54:36,183 --> 01:54:41,259
Then one day, I found something
trappers see fairly regular.

1115
01:54:42,522 --> 01:54:48,441
An animal had gnawed off
its own foot to escape from a trap.

1116
01:54:53,658 --> 01:54:55,946
Something snapped in my head.

1117
01:54:56,119 --> 01:54:59,701
I decided life wasn't fit to live,

1118
01:54:59,873 --> 01:55:04,949
and the only thing to do was
to mingle with the twinkling stars.

1119
01:55:13,261 --> 01:55:15,337
Goodbye, Jack.

(HYSTERICAL LAUGH)

1121
01:55:19,809 --> 01:55:22,928
At that moment, I really was crazy,

1122
01:55:23,104 --> 01:55:26,270
and I was darn near off that cliff
when...

(FIFES AND DRUMS PLAY)

1124
01:55:52,008 --> 01:55:57,002
The time had come
to look the devil in the eye

1125
01:55:57,179 --> 01:56:01,722
and send him to hell
where he belonged.

1126
01:56:01,892 --> 01:56:05,592
The only question was
how to get him there.

1127
01:56:09,108 --> 01:56:11,599
Sergeant, take this man...

1128
01:56:14,405 --> 01:56:16,896
...and give him some clothes.

1129
01:56:22,746 --> 01:56:26,114
This man will be invaluable to me,
Major.

1130
01:56:26,292 --> 01:56:28,498
Invaluable, sir?

1131
01:56:29,128 --> 01:56:33,172
I almost hanged him as a renegade.
Now he asks to be a scout.

1132
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:39,295
Oh, his game is very obvious: to lead
me away from his Indian friends.

1133
01:56:39,471 --> 01:56:43,515
Well, I still don't quite follow you,
General.

1134
01:56:44,518 --> 01:56:48,100
Anything that man tells me
will be a lie.

1135
01:56:48,814 --> 01:56:52,562
Therefore, he will be
a perfect reverse barometer.

1136
01:56:57,823 --> 01:57:01,108
- Isn't that correct?
- Of course, General.

(ORDERS SHOUTED)

1139
01:57:30,564 --> 01:57:34,608
In my belief, Custer's hate
for the Indians and his ambition

1140
01:57:34,776 --> 01:57:37,267
had combined on him.

1141
01:57:37,946 --> 01:57:42,358
He figured he needed one more
dramatic victory over the Indians

1142
01:57:42,534 --> 01:57:46,365
to be nominated for
President of the United States.

1143

Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.

1149

It's the celibacy of the saddle.
I had muscle spasms all night.

- Poison from the goonads.
- Poison from the what, sir?

1151
01:58:21,155 --> 01:58:24,689
Goonads. That's medical terminology.

1152
01:58:24,867 --> 01:58:27,322
General, it's my duty as your...

1153
01:58:33,793 --> 01:58:38,371
The poison rises from the goonads
and seeps down to the muscles.

1154
01:58:40,549 --> 01:58:45,887
The Crows want to know if you're
going down the Medicine Tail Coulee.

1155
01:58:46,055 --> 01:58:48,628
- They do, do they?
- Yes, sir, they do.

1156
01:58:48,808 --> 01:58:53,185
They claim they want time
to sing their death song.

1157
01:58:53,354 --> 01:58:56,141
Tell the Crows they're women.

But if the hostiles come in
behind us,

1159
01:58:59,985 --> 01:59:04,563
and if they're waiting for us below,
we'll never get out of there.

I see no hostiles behind us.
Do you see any?

01:59:10,204 --> 01:59:12,873
- No, sir, not at the moment.
- Then...

...stop trying to cause a reversal
of a Custer decision.

a squad down Medicine Tail Coulee?

01:59:23,217 --> 01:59:29,136
- No, it wouldn't.
- May I ask, sir, why it wouldn't?

1166
01:59:29,306 --> 01:59:33,137
Because it would cost us
the vital element of surprise.

1167

Surprise?
They know we're here.

1168
01:59:36,188 --> 01:59:40,517
But they don't know that
I intend to attack them without mercy.

1169
01:59:40,692 --> 01:59:43,443
- That's no surprise.
- Of course it is.

1170
01:59:43,612 --> 01:59:48,570
Nothing is more surprising
than the attack without mercy.

1174
02:00:05,884 --> 02:00:08,920

General, I implore you to reconsider.

1177

Think of the men
whose lives depend upon you.

What do you say, mule skinner?

1181
02:00:43,671 --> 02:00:47,419
Should I go down there, or withdraw?

1182
02:00:49,802 --> 02:00:52,471
I had him.

1183
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:58,178
But this time what I held in my hand
wasn't a knife, but the truth.

1184
02:00:58,686 --> 02:01:00,643
Well?

1185
02:01:00,813 --> 02:01:03,730
What's your answer, mule skinner?

1186
02:01:04,734 --> 02:01:06,810
General,

1187
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:11,771
you go down there.

1188
02:01:15,828 --> 02:01:19,576
- You're saying, go into the coulee?
- Yes, sir.

1189
02:01:19,749 --> 02:01:22,418
There are no Indians there,
I suppose?

1190
02:01:22,585 --> 02:01:24,661
I didn't say that.

1191
02:01:24,837 --> 02:01:28,917
There are thousands
of Indians down there,

1192
02:01:29,091 --> 02:01:31,582
and when they get done with you,

1193
02:01:31,761 --> 02:01:35,426
there won't be nothing left
but a greasy spot.

1194
02:01:35,598 --> 02:01:38,171

Why do you want to die, Grandfather?
