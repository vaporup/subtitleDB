1
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,933
Only a white man would make a fire

2
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,312
for everyone to see.

3
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,273
Maybe there is more than one.

4
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,610
There might be three or four.

5
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,572
They won't be going home.

6
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,825
We have nothing
to show for this trail.

7
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,035
We have no rifles.

8
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:47,457
The white men are sure to have rifles.

9
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,419
We can't see how many are down there.

10
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,137
Let's forget about this and go home.

11
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,474
Then go.

12
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:11,773
I'd rather die
than argue about some smoke.

13
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,910
He won't quit until we're all dead.

14
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:11,051
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself.

15
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:17,141
I do not like to see
our medicine man going around alone.

16
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,395
What does his wife say?

17
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,606
She says he's keeping to himself.

18
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:28,485
That's not what I asked.
- Well, what did you ask me?

19
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,196
She says he's keeping
to himself these days.

20
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,116
That's what she said.

21
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,790
Make sure that my meat is soft.

22
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,543
My teeth hurt.

23
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,930
May I come in?

24
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,528
No, he can sit with me.

25
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:20,787
Our country seems good this summer.

26
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,958
But I have not been out to see it.

27
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:29,046
But the buffalo are late.

28
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,925
I'm always worried about
the bellies of our children.

29
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:41,934
I was thinking of a dance.
- Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

30
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:48,732
It would be good to have a sign.

31
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,041
It's a funny thing about signs.

32
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:09,336
We know when they are bad or good.

33
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:13,757
But sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

34
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,885
A wise man will think about these things.

35
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:20,264
If he is still confused,
he will tell somebody.

36
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,724
You or me, for instance.

37
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:27,563
A wise man always does this.

38
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:36,446
I have seen such a sign.

39
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,032
Really?

40
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:57,134
I saw a man.
A naked, white man.

41
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,345
Are you sure it was a man?

42
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,307
I saw his sex.

43
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,520
Did you speak to him?

44
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,524
No.

45
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,490
He might be a god.

46
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:06,078
Or a white chief
with special abilities.

47
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,373
We should talk to him.

48
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,961
Don't talk like that
about a white man.

49
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,382
He is not a Sioux
and that makes him less.

50
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:23,303
When I hear that more whites
are coming, I have to laugh.

51
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:28,350
We took 100 horses from them.
There was no honor in that.

52
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,604
They ride badly,
they shoot badly, they're dirty.

53
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:37,359
Their soldiers couldn't even make it
through a single winter here.

54
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:42,531
And these people are flourishing?
I think they'll all be dead soon.

55
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,870
This fool is probably lost.

56
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,713
Wind In His Hair's words are strong.

57
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,842
The whites are a poor race,
and hard to understand.

58
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,970
But make no mistake.
They will come.

59
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,348
Even our enemies agree on this.

60
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,101
When I see one man in our country,
alone and without fear,

61
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,980
I don't think he is lost.
He may have medicine.

62
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:20,819
I see someone who might speak
for all the white people who are coming.

63
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:26,283
I think treaties can be struck
with a man like this.

64
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:34,124
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

65
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:39,671
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

66
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:43,383
He means nothing to us.

67
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:47,304
We will shoot some arrows
into this white man.

68
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,849
If he has medicine,
he won't be hurt.

69
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,394
If he hasn't, he will die.

70
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:03,069
No man can tell another what to do.

71
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,530
But killing a white man
is a delicate matter.

72
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:12,162
If you kill one,
more are sure to come.

73
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,920
These are confusing questions.

74
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:24,966
It's hard to know what to do.

75
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:31,598
We should talk about it some more.
That's all I have to say.

76
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:13,431
What's the matter?
- We don't think this is a good idea.

77
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:18,645
If we take the horse of a white god,
they will write songs about us.

78
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:23,191
Maybe.
- They will let us go on raids.

79
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:28,405
Who gets the horse?
- I do.

80
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:34,202
But we share.
Isn't that a great plan?

81
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,376
It's always the same.

82
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,413
We will be heroes.

83
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:23,668
They will write songs about us.

84
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:40,852
What happened?
What's wrong?

85
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:48,109
I don't know.
I can't move my arm.

86
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:53,657
You shouldn't have fallen off.
We're in trouble now.

87
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,493
It was your idea.

88
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:02,624
My idea was to take the horse,
not fall off.

89
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,631
Otter hurt himself.

90
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:15,220
What are you looking at? It hurts!

91
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:19,975
My father will beat me up with his bow.

92
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:47,288
I am Wind In His Hair!

93
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,750
Do you see that I'm not afraid of you?

94
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:54,963
Do you see?

95
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:13,458
The party that went
against the Utes is coming back.

96
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,336
Many have died.

97
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:26,409
You are not welcome here.

98
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,085
Go away. Go away.

99
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:46,303
Go.
You are not welcome here.

100
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:34,101
Stop! The soldier
did not come here to fight.

101
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:38,063
He is going away, and we'll let him.

102
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:06,675
I agree with Kicking Bird.

103
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,637
We will go
and talk to the white man

104
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:14,725
and find out why he is here.

105
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:28,280
If this is what the council decides,
it will be so.

106
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,367
But it's not right
that a great chief like Ten Bears

107
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:34,745
should talk to a puny white trespasser

108
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:40,125
who has only a smart horse
and a few clothes.

109
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:47,007
I'm not going. You're going.

110
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:55,391
And you.

111
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,269
That will be all.

112
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,594
He has lost his mind.

113
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:11,039
Stands With A Fist.

114
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,045
Let us talk a while.

115
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:28,140
Are your wounds healing well?

116
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:33,645
Yes, they are.

117
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:39,818
Are you happy here, with my family?
- I'm glad to be here.

118
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:45,240
I am missing my husband.

119
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:51,997
Perhaps you will marry again.
- Perhaps.

120
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:02,341
We get word from many places
that the whites are coming.

121
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:08,347
They are coming to everyone's land,
and soon they will come to ours.

122
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:13,185
The white man at the old fort,
I have visited him.

123
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,730
I believe his heart is a good one.

124
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:24,238
I am afraid of him.

125
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:28,951
I'm afraid he will tell others
that I am here.

126
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,622
I'm afraid they will come
to take me away.

127
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:36,708
All our warriors would protect you.

128
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:41,505
I don't know the white man's language,
and he doesn't speak Sioux.

129
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:45,759
It has been a long time
since I spoke their language.

130
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:50,138
I want you to try.
- I don't know how.

131
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:52,557
Yes, you do.
- No.

132
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:57,187
Yes.
- It's dead in me.

133
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:00,941
I don't ask this for me,
but for all the people.

134
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:05,946
He knows many things
about the whites.

135
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:09,700
You must remember.

136
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:13,704
You must remember.
- I can't.

137
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:27,592
Will she make the white words?

138
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:32,055
She won't try.
She's being difficult.

139
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:38,145
She's crying.
Maybe the difficulty is yours.

140
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:36,831
We've been waiting for you.

141
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,804
We've been waiting.

142
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:54,557
Tell him that we are glad that he is here.

143
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:23,753
Ask him why he is at the soldier fort.

144
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:51,990
He's right.
Introductions should come first.

145
02:07:31,226 --> 02:07:33,478
I found it on the prairie.
It's mine.

146
02:07:59,129 --> 02:08:03,216
That hat belongs to the lieutenant.

147
02:08:03,425 --> 02:08:08,221
He left it on the prairie.
He didn't want it.

148
02:08:10,015 --> 02:08:13,935
Well, you can see he wants it now.

149
02:08:14,144 --> 02:08:18,481
We all know that it is a soldier's hat.

150
02:08:19,608 --> 02:08:23,486
We all know who wears it.

151
02:08:23,696 --> 02:08:29,200
If you want to keep it
you have to give him something.

152
02:13:07,562 --> 02:13:10,982
Please use the Skip-button
on your remote control

153
02:13:11,149 --> 02:13:13,317
to skip the intermission.

154
02:21:20,847 --> 02:21:25,893
You were right.
He is a very special white man.

155
02:21:26,102 --> 02:21:28,770
He should have a real name.

156
02:26:12,972 --> 02:26:18,101
You can keep talking in
the white man's tongue, if you like.

157
02:26:18,311 --> 02:26:20,812
I like to talk.

158
02:29:00,932 --> 02:29:03,224
What are you doing?

159
02:29:03,434 --> 02:29:08,063
It's hot,
so we're sitting in the shade.

160
02:29:11,525 --> 02:29:14,527
I'm hungry.

161
02:29:31,337 --> 02:29:35,715
How is Dances With Wolves?

162
02:29:35,967 --> 02:29:41,805
What do you mean?
- How is he learning?

163
02:29:43,099 --> 02:29:46,267
He is a fast learner.

164
02:29:46,477 --> 02:29:50,522
What did you think I meant?

165
02:30:07,039 --> 02:30:11,334
You go to get water?

166
02:30:16,382 --> 02:30:19,384
Let us take you.

167
02:33:20,024 --> 02:33:25,612
You are not talking to him today?
- No, I'm not.

168
02:34:31,011 --> 02:34:37,433
You make a few mistakes,
but you're learning fast.

169
02:34:37,685 --> 02:34:42,397
So what can I tell you today?

170
02:34:43,732 --> 02:34:48,903
About Stands With A Fist.
Why is she not married?

171
02:34:50,614 --> 02:34:54,117
She is in mourning.

172
02:34:57,413 --> 02:35:01,624
I do not understand 'mourning'.

173
02:35:03,377 --> 02:35:06,879
She cries for someone.

174
02:35:08,007 --> 02:35:11,259
Cries for who?

175
02:35:14,388 --> 02:35:17,307
It is not polite to speak of the dead.

176
02:35:17,558 --> 02:35:20,893
But you are new, so I will tell you.

177
02:35:21,103 --> 02:35:25,565
She cries for her husband.
He was killed not long ago.

178
02:35:25,816 --> 02:35:30,611
That's how you came
to find her on the prairie.

179
02:35:33,866 --> 02:35:37,452
How long will she be in mourning?

180
02:35:39,663 --> 02:35:42,915
That's Kicking Bird's decision.

181
02:35:43,125 --> 02:35:47,503
He found her when she was very little.

182
02:36:06,148 --> 02:36:09,400
People are talking about you.

183
02:36:11,695 --> 02:36:13,738
What are they saying?

184
02:36:13,989 --> 02:36:16,532
They are proud

185
02:36:17,868 --> 02:36:21,996
of the medicine you are making
with Dances With Wolves.

186
02:36:24,958 --> 02:36:30,171
I have hurt him,
and I should go and talk to him.

187
02:36:30,422 --> 02:36:35,927
You can't. He's gone.
He left this morning.

188
02:45:34,549 --> 02:45:38,469
Stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.

189
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:41,472
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

190
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:44,099
Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

191
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:47,019
I will get them.

192
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:52,566
Wait. I have guns.

193
02:45:52,817 --> 02:45:55,194
Many rifles, at the fort.

194
02:45:55,403 --> 02:45:57,947
At the fort?

195
02:45:58,657 --> 02:46:00,616
No. The ride is long
and we can spare no men.

196
02:46:00,742 --> 02:46:03,410
Guns would make
one warrior like two.

197
02:46:09,668 --> 02:46:13,712
Take one man and go quickly.

198
02:46:13,964 --> 02:46:17,633
I'll take Smiles A Lot.

199
02:56:18,985 --> 02:56:23,029
When we were young,
he always bragged about his courage.

200
02:56:23,281 --> 02:56:26,116
And what a great chief he would be.

201
02:56:26,367 --> 02:56:30,996
He thought I would be impressed.

202
02:56:31,247 --> 02:56:35,083
Once we ran
into a herd of buffalo on the prairie.

203
02:56:35,334 --> 02:56:39,004
This brave warrior
immediately ran for a tree.

204
02:56:39,213 --> 02:56:43,592
He would have forgotten all about me
if he hadn't needed a leg up.

205
02:56:43,843 --> 02:56:46,845
We sat up there all day

206
02:56:47,054 --> 02:56:49,723
while an old cow circled the tree,

207
02:56:49,974 --> 02:56:53,393
hitting her head against the trunk.

208
02:57:02,528 --> 02:57:05,947
Where are you going?
There's gambling tonight.

209
02:57:06,157 --> 02:57:08,617
Horseback's games are always good.

210
02:57:08,868 --> 02:57:14,873
I'm tired. And he already
has won a good rifle of mine.

211
02:57:16,584 --> 02:57:20,337
Good night.

212
02:58:03,547 --> 02:58:07,467
How long will
Stands With A Fist mourn?

213
02:58:07,718 --> 02:58:10,720
I don't know.

214
02:58:13,182 --> 02:58:16,851
I hope it won't be long.

215
02:58:18,896 --> 02:58:23,858
Has something happened? What?

216
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:27,612
She has found love again.

217
02:58:27,863 --> 02:58:31,366
With who?
- Guess.

218
02:58:31,617 --> 02:58:35,286
Tell me.
- Dances With Wolves.

219
02:58:35,496 --> 02:58:39,374
Are you certain of this?

220
02:58:41,210 --> 02:58:46,172
When you see them together, you'll know.

221
02:58:46,424 --> 02:58:51,594
What are people saying?
- They've accepted it.

222
02:58:56,308 --> 02:58:58,601
No one is angry?

223
02:58:58,811 --> 02:59:03,189
It makes sense.
They are both white.

224
02:59:04,692 --> 02:59:09,654
I suppose
I will have to say something.

225
02:59:09,905 --> 02:59:14,451
She's your daughter now.
- I know.

226
02:59:20,249 --> 02:59:24,961
Relax.
You can't see everything coming.

227
02:59:25,171 --> 02:59:28,673
Quit your playing.

228
02:59:41,979 --> 02:59:46,274
Stands With A Fist.
You will mourn no more.

229
03:00:07,713 --> 03:00:11,216
Sit. Sit.

230
03:00:16,472 --> 03:00:21,601
They say that you want to get married.

231
03:00:21,811 --> 03:00:26,105
To who?
- Stand With A Fist.

232
03:00:26,315 --> 03:00:29,317
It's her, isn't it?
- She's in mourning.

233
03:00:29,527 --> 03:00:30,819
Not today.

234
03:00:30,945 --> 03:00:33,530
Kicking Bird has released her.

235
03:00:33,739 --> 03:00:35,198
He did?

236
03:00:36,200 --> 03:00:39,536
What are you doing here?

237
03:00:39,745 --> 03:00:44,374
Kicking Bird told me to wait.

238
03:00:44,625 --> 03:00:46,751
You might have to wait a long time.

239
03:00:47,002 --> 03:00:52,215
He saw Kicking Bird riding
on the prairie, talking to himself.

240
03:00:52,466 --> 03:00:58,555
A medicine man takes it pretty hard
when he's the last one to know.

241
03:01:01,475 --> 03:01:04,727
What do I do now?

242
03:01:06,897 --> 03:01:10,859
You're pretty poor,
and a Sioux-girl is not for free.

243
03:01:11,110 --> 03:01:14,279
I don't know if you can get married.

244
03:01:18,284 --> 03:01:22,662
I have my horse.
- That's too much medicine.

245
03:01:24,248 --> 03:01:29,210
Do you think my horse is too much medicine?

246
03:01:30,588 --> 03:01:33,506
It is for a girl.

247
03:01:37,595 --> 03:01:41,514
Wait here.
Maybe we can help you.

248
03:01:41,765 --> 03:01:46,644
Wait.
- Alright.

249
03:03:33,293 --> 03:03:35,586
Turn around.

250
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:39,632
You look good.

251
03:03:39,842 --> 03:03:45,596
You know, the man she mourned for
was my best friend.

252
03:03:47,224 --> 03:03:50,393
I didn't know.

253
03:03:51,687 --> 03:03:54,772
He was a good man.

254
03:03:54,982 --> 03:03:58,860
It has been hard for me to like you.

255
03:03:59,111 --> 03:04:02,530
I'm not a thinker like Kicking Bird.

256
03:04:02,740 --> 03:04:07,618
I always get angry first
I got no answers to my questions.

257
03:04:07,828 --> 03:04:12,707
But now I think he went away
because you were coming.

258
03:04:12,958 --> 03:04:15,877
That's how I see it.

259
03:04:39,651 --> 03:04:43,404
This is a good day for me.

260
03:04:47,576 --> 03:04:53,247
If you want this man,
take his hand in yours.

261
03:05:34,790 --> 03:05:38,376
Did you hear what I said?

262
03:05:38,627 --> 03:05:43,005
Have you heard all that I have said?

263
03:05:47,261 --> 03:05:50,680
Good, then take her inside.

264
03:05:50,931 --> 03:05:54,183
She is your wife.

265
03:05:58,147 --> 03:06:01,149
Thank you.

266
03:06:58,665 --> 03:07:01,918
We don't see Dances With Wolves
much these days.

267
03:07:02,169 --> 03:07:05,922
They're having trouble making a baby.

268
03:07:07,216 --> 03:07:09,884
I don't think so.

269
03:07:13,639 --> 03:07:17,934
If we pull the smoke flap shut,
they're sure to come out.

270
03:07:42,167 --> 03:07:45,753
Dances With Wolves,
are you in there?

271
03:07:48,548 --> 03:07:52,593
Today,
I'm riding to a far away place.

272
03:07:52,803 --> 03:07:55,471
I'd like you to come with me.

273
03:08:10,195 --> 03:08:15,616
It feels good to be out.
- I can imagine.

274
03:08:16,827 --> 03:08:20,579
We are trying for a baby.

275
03:08:20,831 --> 03:08:24,500
No waiting?
- No waiting.

276
03:08:28,714 --> 03:08:33,009
I was just thinking,
of all the trails in this life

277
03:08:33,218 --> 03:08:36,887
there is one that matters most:

278
03:08:37,139 --> 03:08:41,851
It is the trail of a true human being.

279
03:08:42,060 --> 03:08:47,648
You are on this trail,
and that's good to see.

280
03:09:06,418 --> 03:09:09,754
We call you the Busy Bee.

281
03:09:45,499 --> 03:09:49,251
It is said that all the animals
were born here.

282
03:09:49,461 --> 03:09:53,464
From here they spread over
the prairies to feed all the people.

283
03:09:53,673 --> 03:09:58,135
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

284
03:10:48,937 --> 03:10:52,356
It's quiet here.

285
03:12:48,223 --> 03:12:52,351
We must wait for these people.

286
03:12:52,561 --> 03:12:58,315
No. They've been gone
a week, maybe more.

287
03:13:00,944 --> 03:13:04,280
We will water the horses and go home.

288
03:13:50,785 --> 03:13:55,164
You always ask
about the white people.

289
03:13:56,249 --> 03:14:00,002
How many more are coming.

290
03:14:00,211 --> 03:14:05,174
There will be a lot, my friend.
More than can be counted.

291
03:14:27,739 --> 03:14:32,034
It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

292
03:14:39,084 --> 03:14:42,920
We should tell Ten Bears.

293
03:15:08,363 --> 03:15:11,198
The men who wore this helmet

294
03:15:11,449 --> 03:15:14,451
came in the time
of my grandfather's grandfather.

295
03:15:14,661 --> 03:15:17,496
Eventually, we drove them out.

296
03:15:17,747 --> 03:15:20,916
Then the Mexicans came.
They don't come anymore.

297
03:15:21,126 --> 03:15:27,131
In my own time: The Texans.
They are like all the others.

298
03:15:30,260 --> 03:15:33,846
They take without asking.

299
03:15:34,055 --> 03:15:37,141
I don't know
if we are ready for these people.

300
03:15:37,350 --> 03:15:40,436
But I think you're right.
I think they will keep coming.

301
03:15:40,645 --> 03:15:46,066
When I think of that, I look at this.

302
03:15:46,276 --> 03:15:51,613
Our land is all we have.

303
03:15:51,823 --> 03:15:56,702
We will fight to keep it.

304
03:15:56,953 --> 03:16:01,415
Tomorrow we will go
to our winter camp.

305
03:17:08,525 --> 03:17:09,358
Enough.

306
03:17:09,859 --> 03:17:11,819
We cannot wait for you.

307
03:19:34,921 --> 03:19:39,466
Something has happened.
He is not coming back.

308
03:19:39,717 --> 03:19:42,010
He must have trouble.

309
03:19:43,513 --> 03:19:49,851
Pick two good men
and send them to the fort.

310
03:25:26,981 --> 03:25:30,984
I am Dances With Wolves.

311
03:25:36,157 --> 03:25:38,616
I have nothing to say to you.

312
03:25:38,868 --> 03:25:42,037
You are not worth talking to.

313
03:40:28,340 --> 03:40:34,595
Dances With Wolves
is very quiet these days.

314
03:40:34,846 --> 03:40:37,932
Is his heart bad?

315
03:40:46,399 --> 03:40:50,236
Killing those soldiers by the river

316
03:40:52,197 --> 03:40:57,952
was a good thing.
I was glad to do it.

317
03:41:02,123 --> 03:41:08,837
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

318
03:41:09,047 --> 03:41:12,466
They think I'm a traitor.

319
03:41:16,930 --> 03:41:20,349
And they will hunt for me.

320
03:41:20,558 --> 03:41:25,688
And when they find me, they find you.

321
03:41:25,897 --> 03:41:32,319
I think it would be wise
to move the village.

322
03:41:38,952 --> 03:41:41,787
I will be leaving.

323
03:41:43,581 --> 03:41:48,627
I must go and talk
with those who would listen.

324
03:41:55,593 --> 03:41:58,929
Quiet. You make my ears hurt.

325
03:42:01,599 --> 03:42:05,102
Leave us alone.

326
03:42:29,878 --> 03:42:33,714
You are the only white man
I've ever known.

327
03:42:33,923 --> 03:42:37,509
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

328
03:42:37,761 --> 03:42:41,805
I think you're wrong.

329
03:42:42,057 --> 03:42:45,476
The man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists.

330
03:42:45,685 --> 03:42:51,357
Now there is only a Sioux
named Dances With Wolves.

331
03:42:56,071 --> 03:42:59,656
Let's smoke a while.

332
03:45:43,738 --> 03:45:46,573
It's all right.

333
03:48:54,053 --> 03:48:58,056
Dances With Wolves!

334
03:48:58,349 --> 03:49:00,892
I am Wind In His Hair!

335
03:49:01,144 --> 03:49:07,482
Do you see that I am your friend?

336
03:49:08,860 --> 03:49:14,072
Can you see that
you will always be my friend?
