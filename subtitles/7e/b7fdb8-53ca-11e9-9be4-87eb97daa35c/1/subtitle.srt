3
00:00:58,287 --> 00:00:59,879
Hey, friend!

4
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,838
Your style's not bad.

5
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:05,562
But take it easy.
You look done in.

6
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:12,122
You must be the Four Door
Fist Champion - Charlie Wei?

7
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:16,521
I'm Charlie Wei.
Your name, if you have one?

8
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,797
Sure, it's Thunderfoot.

9
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:26,324
I've heard of his devil's kick,
it's famous in the kung fu world.

10
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,164
It's never been defeated.

11
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:31,445
And won't be.

12
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,961
I suppose I should warn you.

13
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,158
I've been given good money -
to kill you!

14
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:44,646
Someone's paid you to kill me?
I'll pay twice as much to kill him!

15
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,645
You could,
only my honour comes first.

16
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:50,076
You must realise,
the contract's sealed.

17
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,799
So you must die.

18
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:53,439
Don't be so sure,

19
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:58,402
for I, Champion of the Four Door
Fists, have never yet been defeated.

20
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:03,885
I'll break every bone
in your body and send you to hell!

39
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:28,119
What is it, master?

40
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,965
Finish the lesson.
I must go.

41
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,998
Yes sir, I will, sir.

42
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:40,126
Stop!

43
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,638
I'm now going to demonstrate.

44
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:48,566
The first lesson
is the Five Animal Styles.

45
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:52,361
- He's bonkers. - Three-legged cat.
- Four-eyed rat.

46
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:54,523
Let's get started.

47
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:56,965
Dragon Sees Tiger.

48
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,635
Tiger Rears.

49
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,484
Snake's Tongue Darts Out.

50
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:03,606
Panther Sees Fire.

51
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,963
White Crane Spreads Wings.

52
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,402
No. Hold it, hold it.

53
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:17,484
There isn't any power in your wrist.
How do expect to make any progress?

54
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,605
Straighten it up.

55
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:56,402
I suppose you think that was funny,
playing tricks on your teacher.

56
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,563
Take that! And that!

57
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:02,282
- It wasn't me!
- Who was it? Tell me.

58
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:03,680
Freddy did it.

59
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:11,439
So, Freddy Wong.

60
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:14,365
Just because
your father is Master Wong,

61
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:17,843
gives you no damn right
to cause trouble here.

62
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:21,926
Oh, balls! You think
kung fu is just a performance.

63
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:24,686
You mean my kung fu is lousy?

64
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,844
It's not that bad,
but it's not the best.

65
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:31,516
Suppose you show me
exactly what's wrong with it?

66
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:34,445
Right. Just look at
your panther Sees Fire.

67
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:35,761
Well, what's wrong?

68
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:39,686
That spread between your paws
is an open invite.

69
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,525
And that Horse Stance
is bow-legged.

70
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,400
I bet with one sweep that I...

71
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,000
There, you've been thrown, see?

72
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:51,685
Just wait!

73
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,965
Shut up! Shut up you turkeys!

74
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,842
So, you'd like to test
your teacher's kung fu?

75
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,720
We can all learn
from each other.

76
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:18,996
I can take almost anything, you bum!
But I've taken enough bullshit!

77
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,844
Right! Come on!

78
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,157
You're wide open.
Do you know that, teacher?

79
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,961
See how good his Horse Stance is?

80
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,765
Pork belly, shut up!

81
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,636
Look! Right foot! Chicken Stance.

82
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,119
Bastard!

83
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:22,722
Freddy, you're the cat's ass, making
old crow-face dance like that.

84
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,917
He's so full of bullshit.

85
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:28,243
He thinks he's God's gift
to kung fu.

86
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,357
You sure made him dance!

87
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:31,840
And that face!

88
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:36,085
You did all of us a favour,
that's for sure.

89
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:41,283
- Gee, that's not bad!
- Go have some more then.

90
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,876
Damn that! I was talking
about that chick there.

91
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:48,203
Wow! That perfect frame she's got.
Yeah, sexy.

92
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:50,886
- How much?
- 76.

93
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:53,043
That one in the red?

94
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,681
Imagine being kissed by that chick.

95
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:59,959
Kissing is for children.
I could get her to hug me.

96
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,725
You're kidding. She wouldn't.

97
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,201
You want to bet on it?

98
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:06,556
I'll bet you a whole dinner.

99
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:10,077
She's hot,
she wouldn't look at you twice!

100
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,641
All right! A whole dinner, then.

101
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:20,280
Watch.

102
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,841
He's looking for trouble.

103
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:32,561
- What is it?
- It's agony, my eye.

104
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:35,519
My eye. Blow on it, please.

105
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,479
Can't you help me? Huh, can you?

106
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:40,646
One more, huh?

107
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:44,038
Did you see that?

108
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,606
Thanks a lot.

109
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,445
Hey, a snake! There!

110
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:52,235
Don't be scared,
I'll kill him, it's all right.

111
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,005
That's how it's done.

112
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:57,244
I must try that on your sister.

113
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,402
On my sister?

114
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:05,478
Thought you could take
advantage of my daughter, did you?

115
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,484
Me touch her!
She was asking for it, dumb bitch.

116
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,122
You wanted to lay
your filthy hands on her.

117
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,716
On her? That's a laugh.
She's much too ugly.

118
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:23,557
Think you're real smart, huh?
Well, I'll teach you a lesson, boy.

119
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,606
So you want to play it kung fu?
Try this.

120
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,637
The old bitch is tough.

121
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,639
Hey guys,
you're gonna help me, right?

122
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:01,365
Some friends they make.

123
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:17,880
OK, you're nothing but a skinny
old woman, so I'll let you win!

124
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,246
Fresh greens!

125
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:36,836
What's your game? Stumbling
about like some drunken stooge.

126
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,082
Don't answer back.

127
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:40,526
Hey! Master!

128
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,683
Antique jade!

129
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,282
Look, sir, antique jade.

130
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,166
Is it real??

131
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:53,916
But of course. It's an heirloom.
It's valuable, sir.

132
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:56,879
- How much is it?
- Ten bucks.

133
00:10:56,927 --> 00:11:00,476
- So expensive?
- It's worth it.

134
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,880
Here.

135
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,799
Just ten cents.

136
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:05,760
Hey! Hey, sir!

137
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:10,323
You can't give me this,
it wouldn't buy an old plate.

138
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:13,598
I couldn't sell
such a valuable piece for this.

139
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,239
No sale, no money.

140
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:16,720
But my jade!

141
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:22,002
That was all I had in the world!

142
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,924
Well, take this.

143
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:27,004
Daddy, Daddy, are you all right?

144
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:30,084
- At least give me something!
- Sure!

145
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,685
Daddy!

146
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,959
What's wrong, old man?

147
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:38,477
He smashed my jade and he won't pay.

148
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,884
Shithead! Piss off!

149
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:44,883
Talking to your mother?

150
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:46,246
Rot in hell.

151
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,798
Hand over this man's money.

152
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:54,362
Pay? Not before I put you
in the ground.

153
00:11:54,407 --> 00:12:00,482
It's too bad you feel that way,
because I'm in a bad mood.

154
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:03,917
Now I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

155
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:35,326
You're mad!

156
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:49,119
You almost killed me!

157
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,562
Wow, my knuckles just escaped.

158
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:12,565
This is for you, now get going!

159
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,161
That's enough, I'm dying.

160
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,995
Don't worry, you're safe,
it's only the blunt side.

161
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:35,555
I've no intention of killing you.

162
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,120
Not yet.

163
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,284
Please, Please!

164
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:50,318
That one came pretty close.
Watch what you're doing.

165
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,840
Drop dead.

166
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:08,639
You're lucky I missed, this time,
but it's quite by accident.

167
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:13,204
I chop, chop, chop...

168
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,363
Then, I slice, slice, slice...

169
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:19,400
And then I beat, beat, beat...
and mix it all together.

170
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:22,086
You sure have brightened my day.

171
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:34,205
You know, it must be at least ten
years, brother, since we last met.

172
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:38,843
You hardly look a day older.
I wouldn't have recognised my niece.

173
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:43,438
She isn't a bad girl,
just a bit na'i've.

174
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,159
And where is Freddy?

175
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:48,961
That young rascal,
he's always getting into trouble.

176
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:53,239
He's grown up now,
you won't recognise him.

177
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:56,245
So, you'll stay for a few days?

178
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,084
Freddy!

179
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:01,278
Freddy, come and meet your aunt!

180
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:07,403
- Come on, lad.
- Coming.

181
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:17,880
Say hello.

182
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,441
Hello, Auntie, cousin.

183
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,717
- Hello.
- Hello, Freddy.

184
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,758
What on earth's the matter?

185
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,559
I've pulled a muscle.

186
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:30,043
I'll soon put that right.
Here, let your aunt...

187
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,566
No, I'm all right.

188
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:34,644
Relax, just for a second. That's it.

189
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:36,646
Oh, dear.

190
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,126
Oh, mother!

191
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:41,525
Well, you feel better?

192
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,478
Thank you, yes.

193
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:50,440
He'll be all right now. Your son's
grown into a smart-looking fellow.

194
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:54,082
He's quite clever,
and his kung fu's not bad.

195
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:58,439
Oh? I would like
to see his kung fu sometime.

196
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:01,047
OK, you'd enjoy a match.

197
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:06,002
People say you're strict with him
and that he's a good boy.

198
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:08,481
Tell me what else they say.

199
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:13,362
They say he's courteous and polite,
setting other boys a good example,

200
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,921
and that he's well-mannered
and obliging.

201
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:21,564
That makes me really proud to be
his father. Freddy, come here, son.

202
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:31,641
I'm glad he isn't like the other
boys here. They're real sex maniacs.

203
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:36,317
Only today my own daughter
was attacked by one of them.

204
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:40,406
What's more, when I went
to rescue her, he attacked me!

205
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:45,999
What? You mean to tell me both
of you were attacked in my own town!

206
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:52,077
- Would you recognise him?
- As if I could forget! Yes.

207
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:58,600
Good! When I find him, I'll flay
him alive! Freddy, come on!

208
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:02,162
- Uncle, there's really no need.
- But, why?

209
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,721
Because he's in this very room.

210
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,325
But where?

211
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,961
Over there,
your precious son, Freddy.

212
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:15,078
What? It can't...

213
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:21,679
Down on your knees!

214
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:22,842
Please!

215
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:26,357
You'll pay for this,
you scum, you criminal!

216
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,404
Ah! Oh, my God!

217
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,242
- Mr Wong.
- Yes, Mr Li. What has happened?

218
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:53,803
I'll tell you, that bastard
son of yours beat him up.

219
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,762
Why would he do that?

220
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:00,640
Because he's nothing
but a wild animal.

221
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:04,680
He attacked my son,
breaking all the bones in his body!

222
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:11,522
He really beat him up.
He's all wrapped up like a dumpling!

223
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,957
Wong, what are you going to do?

224
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:19,724
Vermin from hell,
I'll beat you to death!

225
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:20,961
No, no!

226
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:24,406
Brother,
you mustn't kill your own son.

227
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:28,725
I've got to kill this devil,
he's a disgrace.

228
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,918
Sounds bad for a teacher
of your standing

229
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,720
to flog his own son to death.

230
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:40,603
If he must be punished, I suggest
that Mr Li here, is quite capable.

231
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,005
Stop him!

232
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:49,006
I beat your son,
so let him punish me.

233
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:53,040
There, you hit me,
I promise I won't fight back.

234
00:18:54,727 --> 00:19:01,121
So, you think you're funny, huh? OK,
Mr Wong, what are you going to do?

235
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:07,515
I disown him! This slime is mine no
longer. Do what you like with him.

236
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,764
So, my suggestion -
you pick your man,

237
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:14,846
he'll fight Freddy who'll be
strictly forbidden to fight back.

238
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:20,200
Ten blows should be enough.
Now, Mr Li, do you approve?

239
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:25,159
Ten blows won't be needed.
I'll do it in three!

240
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:32,083
Master, listen,
I'm going to fix that squirt.

241
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:36,837
Be sure you leave him
looking just like I am now.

242
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,244
The Divine Eight, that palm-style
of yours is really something.

243
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,323
Ha! I'm only starting.

244
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,245
I'm not dead yet.

245
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,044
Enough!

246
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:04,802
That's your ten blows, Mr Chao.

247
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:10,036
And you said
you'd put me down in three.

248
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:15,439
Snake and crane together.

249
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:19,804
Strike the viper points.

250
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,920
Let's try your Divine Eight again.

251
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,005
I told you I've got style.

252
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,845
Hey, my jacket's getting dirty,
take it!

253
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:44,279
You regret not paying
for that jade now!

254
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:48,238
You've got the wrong guy.

255
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,283
Are you all right, master?

256
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:57,962
Idiot!

257
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:13,159
Master, now I look just like you.

258
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:21,238
OK, you win with your smart tricks.
I'll get you back. Let's go!

259
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:27,285
You haven't heard the last of us.
Come on, let's get out of here.

260
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,919
I'll get you yet!

261
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,446
Careful, careful!

262
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:38,638
He came in with one cripple
and left with two.

263
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:43,124
You fight well, I give you credit,
but I'll still kill you!

264
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:46,716
You mustn't kill
a child of your blood.

265
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,201
Break his wicked ways
through practice.

266
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,363
I've tried with that bastard.

267
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:54,922
Right! From now on
you stay in this house.

268
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,720
We'll start with five hours
Horse Stance!

269
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,362
Now, don't move.

270
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,682
Have some more boiling water!

271
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,205
There!

272
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,960
Are you comfortable?

273
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:06,043
Are your legs shaking,
are they aching?

274
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:10,239
You know, I feel really sorry
for you. Poor little chicken!

275
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:21,881
I bet you this will tickle.

276
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,836
Stop! Don't do that.

277
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:33,039
- What are you trying to do?
- Carrying out orders!

278
00:25:33,087 --> 00:25:35,396
It's your father's idea.

279
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:40,441
He says for every bowl you break,
you stay another hour. You bastard!

280
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,480
Darned idiot!

281
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,446
Master!

282
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:31,366
Master.

283
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:37,723
Yes, his stance
appears to be pretty steady.

284
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,235
Sure he hasn't had a rest?

285
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:43,882
I've been watching him
like a hawk, absolutely not.

286
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:47,124
You're certain?
Well, any problems?

287
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,806
Yes, I feel very tired.

288
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:54,045
- Tired? You don't seem to be.
- I am, sir.

289
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:56,726
Even though you're sitting
on a chair?

290
00:26:56,767 --> 00:27:02,717
What? Sitting on a chair?
Let me see. Oh my God, he is!

291
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,885
You young criminal,
I've tried to teach you, but no.

292
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,885
Well, it leaves me
no alternative, then.

293
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:13,683
I'll have to ask Uncle
to discipline you.

294
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,685
- Who's that?
- Beggar Su.

295
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:22,484
Ow! My foot again!

296
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:41,843
Hurry up pinhead,
it's choking me!

297
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,724
Won't be a second.

298
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,885
Practising your kung fu
upside down, huh?

299
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,326
I'm dying.

300
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,164
Here, something to eat.

301
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:02,198
Here! Wait till I get some water.

302
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:08,526
Take this thing off my neck.
It's killing me.

303
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,000
Hurry!

304
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:22,278
Hey, come on, get up!

305
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,160
Why did you get down so fast?

306
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,246
Here, eat this.

307
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:40,565
Is it true Beggar Su
is going to train you?

308
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:45,719
That's bad news for you.
You've heard about that bastard?

309
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,565
I know he's a bit hard.

310
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:52,156
Worse than that.
You'll be crippled for life.

311
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:56,439
I'm telling you, honest.
I'm not kidding.

312
00:28:56,487 --> 00:29:01,481
I knew one young guy who was
his student, wow, was he a mess!

313
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,602
He lost all his teeth,
his hair was torn out.

314
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:10,277
You should have seen his busted
nose! His father didn't know him.

315
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:13,205
He's a real sadist, a torturer.

316
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,316
Then, what can I do?

317
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:18,517
You'd better do something.

318
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:23,806
I've got to think fast.
Think, damn you, think!

319
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:34,238
Let's see, you might, ah...

320
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:36,676
- Yeah, we run like hell!
- Yeah, we run like hell!

321
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,922
That's not running, come on!

322
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,958
Hurry! Follow me.

323
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:44,406
Yue He Restaurant

324
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:47,602
Dumplings, dumplings!

325
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:50,478
Take a seat over there.

326
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:07,637
Excuse me,
do you mind if I sit here?

327
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:09,086
No, sit down.

328
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:13,200
You're by yourself, good,
I don't like eating on my own.

329
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:14,919
Sit down, sit down.

330
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,484
This restaurant's not bad.

331
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:21,202
Look at the food,
so wonderful, so juicy.

332
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:23,442
Real good smell, really fantastic.

333
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,922
What can I get you, sir?

334
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:32,198
- This is such a surprise!
- What's that?

335
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,238
No, no, go ahead, eat!

336
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:37,723
I'll start with
a bowl of shark's fin.

337
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,485
Sorry, no shark's fin.

338
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:44,681
Too bad. Soya pork, roast goose -
plenty of fat, steamed grouper...

339
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,445
Sorry sir, no grouper.

340
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:51,686
Then any fish will do.
Steamed abalone and shrimp noodles.

341
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:55,959
- Yes, sir.
- A pint of wine, right away.

342
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:59,082
Can you really eat all that?

343
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:04,520
Easy, I'm still growing,
I've got to keep strong and fit.

344
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:29,081
That's great, oh boy!
Now we eat. Thank you.

345
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:35,761
Have a little wine, be my guest,
drink up, this looks good.

346
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,604
Oh, boy, I'm starving.

347
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:40,320
Here, taste that. Eat up!

348
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:46,319
Go on, don't be shy! Help yourself.

349
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:49,447
I insist! Drink, drink, drink.

350
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,079
- Cheers
- Cheers

351
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:56,247
Wow, this is such good grub!

352
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:00,800
Go on!

353
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,446
I say, boy...

354
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:20,121
He really gets that food down!

355
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,844
Ah, feels great.

356
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:22,320
Well, friend,
that was really special.

357
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,085
Delicious! Now listen, friend.

358
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:29,645
I've got to go now.
This meal's on me, I insist!

359
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:32,645
I'll pay as I'm leaving.
We'll meet tomorrow.

360
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:36,680
Finish your dinner.
See you tomorrow! Bye, now.

361
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:39,482
Sorry.

362
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:41,324
See you tomorrow, bye.

363
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,962
That will be exactly $1.05.

364
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:47,680
I'm not paying.

365
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,922
You're not? Well, who is?

366
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:53,522
The old guy over there.

367
00:33:57,047 --> 00:33:58,765
He's a good friend?

368
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:01,002
I'm his son, you idiot!

369
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:05,723
Is that so, now?
Just how many fathers do you have?

370
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:10,283
That guy owns this place
and you're talking to his son.

371
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:12,238
That makes you a bastard.

372
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:17,407
Thought the meals were free here,
did you? We don't give credit.

373
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:18,956
Pay or die!

374
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:28,999
I've forgotten my money, that's all.

375
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:32,960
I'll fetch it right now,
and I'll pay the bill.

376
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:34,406
Oh, yeah?

377
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:46,366
Pay or die!

378
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,404
Gorilla, get him!

379
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:55,879
Oh, no.

380
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:48,402
Hold it, let's talk!

381
00:35:54,567 --> 00:36:00,164
Pig, you were so greedy
for all that food, now spit it out!

382
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:08,805
One roast leg!

383
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:14,886
One soya pork!

384
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,645
That's enough.

385
00:36:17,687 --> 00:36:20,520
And one pint of wine yet.

386
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:27,001
Now you've emptied my belly,
I'm hungry again.

387
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:40,960
Hey, that's enough,
or do you want to kill the boy?

388
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:44,886
For your information,
he's going to clean the toilets.

389
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:51,565
You want something to clean, huh?

390
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,444
Thanks, old man.

391
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:03,079
You dare to interfere
in our business?

392
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:06,119
I'm the gorilla, watch how I jump!

393
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,365
Jump, then!

394
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:15,997
Now he's jumping all right!

395
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:20,086
It hurts!

396
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:44,560
This is how to wash your face.

397
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,439
You thief!

398
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,078
Let's be friends.

399
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,926
You've got arms of iron,
but you've brains of straw.

400
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,366
Stop that.

401
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:01,606
This way.

402
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:16,360
I can't help wondering
how old you are, old man.

403
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:19,046
For your age, you sure are tough.

404
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:24,286
I've had to be tough
to survive to this age.

405
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,239
I'm not like the young men today.

406
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:30,757
None of you can fight.
Always getting thrashed.

407
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,243
Today was a bad day.

408
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:39,405
Usually with one blow
I'd have done the lot!

409
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:42,041
You haven't seen my real style.

410
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,803
That sounds like an excuse.

411
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:49,716
I forgot to ask why
you couldn't pay for your meal.

412
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,964
That's a long story.

413
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:55,285
And what's your name?

414
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,124
I'm Mr Su.

415
00:39:57,447 --> 00:40:02,646
Hey, there's a fellow with the same
name screwing up my life!

416
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,281
That's why I'm on the run.

417
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:11,918
He's this creep, named Beggar Su,
my father asked to train me.

418
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:16,165
- So you're afraid then?
- What? I'm not afraid.

419
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:22,564
Though I've heard he's very cunning,
violent and mean. But I'll show him!

420
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:28,397
That old fart. Wait till I see him,
I'll tear him apart.

421
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:30,244
You'll show the fart, huh?

422
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:34,075
Yeah, sure. Where do you come from?

423
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:38,803
The sky is my roof
and I sleep wherever I may.

424
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:40,838
You're a bum, that it?

425
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:43,481
Everyone knows me as Beggar Su.

426
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:47,640
Your name is Beggar Su as well??

427
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:51,795
- Beggar Su?
- That's the name, young fellow.

428
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:12,841
Lucky I'm fast on my feet.
That was close.

429
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,684
Not fast enough.

430
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:21,279
You can run as fast as you like,
but you can't get away.

431
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,241
Now, listen.

432
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:31,998
Your father's paid me well to train
you and I'm going to do it.

433
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:38,317
It hurts!
How long will this take?

434
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:42,199
- A day?
- One year exactly.

435
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,044
I'll never make it.

436
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:54,362
You already have your cash,
so you can relax.

437
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:57,205
But I'm going to enjoy this!

438
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,238
I'll see you in hell!

439
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:16,079
Damn you!

440
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:20,439
Let me go, you're breaking my neck.

441
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:31,877
You're just an old beggar.
Like to pretend you're a real tiger?

442
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:34,919
I'll show you what a tiger's about.

443
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:50,595
I see your tiger's
got a bad paw, huh?

444
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:08,805
It's still there.

445
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:27,280
All that kung fu looks like dancing.

446
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:30,765
The Crane attacks!

447
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:36,961
Angry Crane. Crane eats The Shrimp!

448
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:40,126
The Crane flies.

449
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,561
Your fingers are stronger
than my teeth!

450
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:05,323
I'm coming to get you!

451
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:08,599
You scared me!

452
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,087
Climbing trees to get away now.

453
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:14,959
Monkey kung fu.

454
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:42,399
You're choking me.

455
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:44,765
Ready to learn?

456
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:47,955
- Answer!
- My head!

457
00:44:48,007 --> 00:44:51,716
- Are you?
- I guess I've got no choice.

458
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:54,679
But I don't like
your style of recruitment.

459
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:22,196
Let me down!
I don't want to die yet!

460
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:37,882
You're supposed to be a teacher,
you'd break a gorilla in half.

461
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:43,041
All students with style
must learn how to fall.

462
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,681
That was only your first lesson.

463
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,844
Where are you going?

464
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:40,400
To take a piss.

465
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:43,439
- Over there!
- All right, teacher.

466
00:46:56,367 --> 00:47:00,155
From the right jar
to the left jar.

467
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:08,285
The back jar to the right jar.

468
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:14,441
The back jar to the front jar.

469
00:47:20,527 --> 00:47:22,995
Left jar to the right jar.

470
00:47:23,687 --> 00:47:26,076
Right jar to the front jar.

471
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:36,325
Stupid old man,
playing games with jars.

472
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:39,484
Break my back is all this will do.

473
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:42,845
Come on, hurry!

474
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:46,999
He's so mean.

475
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:15,756
Freddy! Freddy! Freddy!

476
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:32,119
Have a good wash,
you old crank!

477
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:04,881
Hey you, get out of here.

478
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:10,803
Asshole, piss off. Are you deaf?

479
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,123
Are you blind?
Can't you see I'm busy?

480
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:18,359
No hanging around, you bum.
Move your ass.

481
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:22,764
Who says? Is this your place?
Suppose I don't move it?

482
00:49:23,887 --> 00:49:29,484
A big mouth and a wet ass.
It should be taught some manners.

483
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:40,287
How's it feel?? Nice and dry?

484
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:45,242
Right, you twerp! I'll give you dry.
I'll shove you in head first.

485
00:49:54,207 --> 00:49:55,686
Come on.

486
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:18,119
What's that supposed to be, kung fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?

487
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:21,637
No-one calls my dad's kung fu shit!

488
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,843
Judging by that,
your old man's kung fu stinks.

489
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:42,038
I wouldn't ask him
to clean my shoes.

490
00:50:47,287 --> 00:50:49,801
Perhaps it's better
you call me Father.

491
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:51,246
Go to hell!

492
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:01,517
Sit down! Stand up!

493
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:03,758
Sit down!

494
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:08,042
All my sons must obey.

495
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:35,719
I don't even need to use my hands.

496
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:38,759
You better use them, I'm not scared.

497
00:51:50,047 --> 00:51:51,446
Had enough?

498
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:54,886
I'll fight to the end!

499
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:05,246
Your hand! Your stomach!
Your leg! Your head! Get lost!

500
00:52:07,647 --> 00:52:10,081
- Get back!
- Why?

501
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,517
So, you're hiding in
your turtle shell now.

502
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:30,957
Your skull's like butter.
It's not worth it.

503
00:52:31,007 --> 00:52:37,799
You could study kung fu for the rest
of your life, but you won't beat me.

504
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:52,641
I won't kill a nobody like you.
It could ruin my good reputation.

505
00:52:52,687 --> 00:52:59,126
Bend down and crawl between my legs.
Then go home to your pig-stys.

506
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:00,885
Crawl!

507
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:15,244
Go on!

508
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,324
Wait!

509
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:34,199
Aren't these your pants?

510
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:27,166
What's that supposed to be, kung fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?

511
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:38,203
Your skull is like butter.

512
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:43,844
You could study for the rest
of your life, but you won't beat me.

513
00:54:57,687 --> 00:55:02,442
I won't kill a nobody like you.
It could ruin my good reputation.

514
00:55:02,487 --> 00:55:07,083
Bend down and crawl.
Go back home and clean pig-stys.

515
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:09,846
Crawl between my legs, crawl!

516
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:26,881
Careful with that wine.
It's very expensive.

517
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:31,324
It smells good.

518
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:33,882
Let me dry your cloak.

519
00:56:49,527 --> 00:56:52,678
Hey, sexy, where are your trousers?

520
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:07,604
My God! It's burning!

521
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:10,241
You burnt my cloak!

522
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:15,042
That's my best cloak!

523
00:57:49,247 --> 00:57:50,760
My wrists!

524
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:13,920
My wrists!

525
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,399
Your wrists seem to be very weak.

526
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:27,200
More rabbit food.

527
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:31,001
Tea's weak and it's cold again.

528
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:35,121
Teacher, you're giving me
a headache.

529
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:36,566
Eat!

530
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:48,080
Weak wrists?
Can't pick up your food? Here.

531
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:12,358
Teacher, I'm finished.

532
01:00:12,727 --> 01:00:15,321
- That was quick.
- Yeah.

533
01:00:15,527 --> 01:00:19,281
Use these smaller cups
and pour it back again.

534
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,404
Go on.

535
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:26,797
I wish I'd known
about this part first.

536
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:35,642
Oh, this is killing me.

537
01:00:39,447 --> 01:00:41,642
- Hey, Freddy.
- What?

538
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,997
Crack this walnut for me.

539
01:00:47,887 --> 01:00:51,675
No, you've got to do it this way.

540
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:55,405
Now you try.

541
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,967
Please, teacher!
Haven't I cracked enough?

542
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:59,603
To hell with this.
Why don't we take a walk?

543
01:02:01,287 --> 01:02:02,515
All right.

544
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:08,757
- I did it!
- You won again!

545
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:11,399
Look at this!

546
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:17,164
- You're very quick!
- Of course!

547
01:02:18,127 --> 01:02:19,560
Place your bets.

548
01:02:19,607 --> 01:02:22,917
My money on the right.

549
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:26,359
Hey, get going now.

550
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:30,719
What, go now?
I haven't made my wine money yet.

551
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:35,604
I've still got more money to win.

552
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:40,325
- There! Who's betting?
- Back your winner now.

553
01:02:45,167 --> 01:02:48,557
Come on, lift up the cup!

554
01:02:55,047 --> 01:02:56,400
Enough noise!

555
01:02:57,767 --> 01:02:59,166
Lift it up!

556
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:02,765
You win! Ha, ha!

557
01:03:03,527 --> 01:03:07,156
We won again! This is great!

558
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,402
I knew you would.

559
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:15,078
We've got enough for a good meal
and wine. We're rich!

560
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:20,520
You there, old man.
I'll play a game with you.

561
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:23,923
Right! This is my lucky day.

562
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:51,077
Go ahead, choose.

563
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:58,766
Let's see.

564
01:04:09,087 --> 01:04:12,079
- See? It's not there.
- Hold it.

565
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:13,526
Watch it!

566
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:17,162
Think you're quick, huh?
Well, my eyes are quicker.

567
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:19,239
Lay off!

568
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:24,357
So, you're trying to cheat, huh?

569
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:28,323
Police! Police!

570
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:29,881
Everybody move!

571
01:04:29,927 --> 01:04:31,201
Teacher!

572
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:35,001
Trying to escape, huh?

573
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:38,124
Hey! Hold it!

574
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:41,637
You're a dirty thief.
Give me back my money!

575
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:46,317
I don't have your money.
Meathead, don't you know who I am?

576
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:47,766
Who cares!

577
01:04:48,807 --> 01:04:53,597
I'll tell you who I am,
I'm Iron Head.

578
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,843
Oh, that's really hard!

579
01:04:59,807 --> 01:05:01,399
Scared?

580
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:03,326
Hey, baldy!

581
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:08,680
Get this straight, pay the money.
I don't care if you're a tiger!

582
01:05:08,727 --> 01:05:13,755
I warn you shitface,
I choose who I bury next!

583
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:18,198
Say your prayers, because
you're about to feel my iron head!

584
01:05:36,207 --> 01:05:40,405
- His head's too hard!
- Don't give up now!

585
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:43,041
Let's see you stop Iron Head.

586
01:06:05,607 --> 01:06:07,325
Good, very good!

587
01:06:32,647 --> 01:06:34,160
You sure can jump.

588
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:38,439
Bet you never guessed you'd end up
jumping into someone's pants!

589
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:39,886
Why, you!

590
01:06:59,487 --> 01:07:01,125
Here, boy.

591
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,757
Great, it works.
Here, hard nut, try this!

592
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:33,801
Are you still Iron Head?

593
01:07:35,527 --> 01:07:37,563
That's enough, please!

594
01:07:37,607 --> 01:07:39,359
Sure!

595
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:56,476
Teacher, my wrists are breaking!

596
01:08:14,327 --> 01:08:18,718
One, two, three, four, five, six...

597
01:08:20,967 --> 01:08:22,559
Oh, my hands!

598
01:08:28,967 --> 01:08:32,880
No more exercises.
Go fetch some more wine.

599
01:08:32,927 --> 01:08:34,326
OK, teacher.

600
01:08:34,847 --> 01:08:36,485
Ru Yi's Restaurant.

601
01:08:45,607 --> 01:08:47,006
Waiter!

602
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:52,042
- Some wine.
- Shall I fill it up?

603
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:55,079
No three cups will be enough.

604
01:08:55,127 --> 01:08:59,518
- Is that all??
- Come on, be quick!

605
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:07,597
Here you are.

606
01:09:27,287 --> 01:09:32,315
Damn it! Where's that stupid boy
with my wine?

607
01:09:41,647 --> 01:09:43,239
The bastard!

608
01:09:49,327 --> 01:09:50,919
That's him!

609
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:59,965
Old man, what school are you from?

610
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:01,520
And you?

611
01:10:03,727 --> 01:10:08,164
Old man, have you heard
of the King of Sticks?

612
01:10:08,207 --> 01:10:13,759
Yes, of course. I've no doubt
Beggar Su rings a bell.

613
01:10:13,887 --> 01:10:17,277
- Beggar Su?
- The same.

614
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:21,758
Let's get out of here.

615
01:10:21,807 --> 01:10:24,196
Wait! You don't believe that liar?

616
01:10:24,247 --> 01:10:27,444
- Why not?
- See his hands?

617
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:33,920
Beggar Su wouldn't be shaking
like that. You can see he's a fake!

618
01:10:37,047 --> 01:10:41,677
So you think you're being funny.
I'm not fooled so easy.

619
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:45,197
But I'm not lying, I am Beggar Su!

620
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,760
Well, let's see.

621
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:41,047
- Teacher!
- The wine!

622
01:11:50,327 --> 01:11:51,521
It's water!

623
01:11:57,767 --> 01:12:00,327
Idiot! Now see what you've done.

624
01:12:09,287 --> 01:12:10,640
Teacher!

625
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,606
Teacher!

626
01:12:39,247 --> 01:12:40,646
Take that!

627
01:13:04,007 --> 01:13:09,718
They were damn lucky. Next time
I'll take them apart! Let's go.

628
01:13:33,727 --> 01:13:36,195
Cheer up, eat something.

629
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:40,837
Teacher,
it's my fault you were beaten.

630
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:43,685
It seems
bad luck follows you around.

631
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:47,606
I've seen a lot of things,
but till today,

632
01:13:47,647 --> 01:13:50,605
I've never been beaten in a fight.

633
01:13:50,647 --> 01:13:55,038
He wasn't better, but you've
no strength without your wine.

634
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:57,879
You sure can talk.

635
01:13:58,447 --> 01:14:04,044
True, but if I was taught better,
I could've beaten that jerk.

636
01:14:04,087 --> 01:14:07,796
You mean to say I'm not
teaching you right?

637
01:14:09,287 --> 01:14:14,839
You're just pushing me around.
You're teaching me how to be beaten.

638
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:25,523
Your father is without question
an excellent martial arts master.

639
01:14:25,567 --> 01:14:28,127
His methods
are amongst the best,

640
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:32,524
so why would he ask me
to teach you my style?

641
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:34,637
So you could torture me.

642
01:14:36,287 --> 01:14:41,441
He asked me because he knows
I've got a secret style.

643
01:14:41,487 --> 01:14:42,840
Tell me then!

644
01:14:42,887 --> 01:14:46,084
The secret of my Eight Drunken Gods!

645
01:14:46,127 --> 01:14:50,245
I suppose you'll teach me
The Crawl of the Drunken Cat!

646
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:53,279
That shows your damned ignorance.

647
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:58,765
Dozens have begged me to show them,
I've always refused, so there!

648
01:15:30,607 --> 01:15:35,317
Don't be fooled by my staggering,
there's power inside to kill,

649
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:40,885
It looks real enough, yet it isn't,
the pretence lets you win.

650
01:15:59,567 --> 01:16:00,966
Clever, isn't it?

651
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:05,120
Why haven't you shown me yet?

652
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:10,241
You must know the basics,
or all your work is wasted.

653
01:16:10,287 --> 01:16:13,199
Why do you think
I've been pushing you?

654
01:16:13,247 --> 01:16:17,479
So you can master the techniques
of the Eight Drunken Gods.

655
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:21,043
- I think you're ready.
- Really?

656
01:16:21,087 --> 01:16:26,684
To study my style, you'll find it
easier if you have a drink first.

657
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:30,120
Drink up.

658
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,400
Have another cup.

659
01:16:44,287 --> 01:16:46,721
Freddy, did you go to school??

660
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:49,361
Yes, for a while.

661
01:16:51,727 --> 01:16:53,445
Drink up the wine.

662
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:59,043
- Cup shall not rest.
- I'll recite a poem.

663
01:16:59,087 --> 01:17:02,045
It'll put your ears to the test.

664
01:17:02,207 --> 01:17:08,521
Power and wealth are to no avail
when only our drinking prevails.

665
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,519
Boy, enough, enough.

666
01:17:14,287 --> 01:17:19,441
Sober men and sages
are both lost through the ages.

667
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,479
All our brave drinkers
shall never die.

668
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:26,080
All our brave drinkers
shall never die.

669
01:17:26,127 --> 01:17:29,358
Shing Fung produces
the finest of wines.

670
01:17:29,847 --> 01:17:33,635
The best soldiers
of Shien Yang are always young.

671
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:38,319
Even the King
couldn't stop my drinking.

672
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:42,155
Let's drink a toast
to our ship that's sinking.

673
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:46,318
With uplifted cup,
I say to the moon:

674
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:51,759
Why does my shadow appear to swoon?

675
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:55,239
Wine in a radiant cup you see.

676
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:58,165
Put down that cup,
the horses await thee.

677
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:04,564
Fallen in the field of battle, the
soldier says who will remember me?

678
01:18:05,607 --> 01:18:07,518
Who will remember me?

679
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:22,003
The God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.

680
01:18:57,247 --> 01:19:01,957
The God Li, the drunken cripple
with the powerful right leg

681
01:19:27,087 --> 01:19:31,797
The God Jun, the drunkard
holding a pot in his arms.

682
01:19:56,087 --> 01:20:01,445
The God Lan, the drunkard
with the sudden deadly waist attack.

683
01:20:26,127 --> 01:20:30,996
The God Chan, the drunkard
with the swift double-kicks.

684
01:20:57,167 --> 01:21:01,240
The God Tso, the drunkard
with the powerful throatlock.

685
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:28,995
The God Han, the drunken
flute player of the powerful wrists.

686
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:51,597
The God Miss Ho, the drunken woman
flaunting her body.

687
01:21:58,927 --> 01:22:00,121
Ouch!

688
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:02,761
Come on, boy, this is serious.

689
01:22:02,807 --> 01:22:05,037
That's meant for women.

690
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:10,480
Miss Ho is a woman, yes,
but she is strong. Watch and learn.

691
01:22:28,367 --> 01:22:31,962
- Can you do it?
- I've got it.

692
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:35,517
- Put some energy in.
- Yeah, OK.

693
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:41,445
This is sissy. I won't do it.

694
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:50,437
Mr Wong, why did you persuade
the people of Bull Hill

695
01:22:50,487 --> 01:22:54,036
not to sell me their property? Well??

696
01:22:56,407 --> 01:23:00,082
Was it because of
that business with your son?

697
01:23:00,127 --> 01:23:02,800
That will be settled in good time.

698
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:05,281
I'm not responsible.
What's your game?

699
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:07,283
What is yours?

700
01:23:07,327 --> 01:23:11,605
I'm most interested
to know why you want to buy.

701
01:23:11,647 --> 01:23:14,286
The graveyard
on that hill is cursed.

702
01:23:14,327 --> 01:23:15,840
It's disturbing family spirits.

703
01:23:15,887 --> 01:23:19,482
It's destroying my feng shui,
so I must buy it.

704
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:24,396
They'll get more than $20 per lot,
it's good money for that land.

705
01:23:24,447 --> 01:23:26,085
Your concern isn't wanted.

706
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:30,325
I don't think it's that simple.

707
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:35,202
There's a curse on the name of Li
and it must be exorcised.

708
01:23:35,247 --> 01:23:37,442
I've got three childless mistresses.

709
01:23:37,487 --> 01:23:41,116
They can't even produce
a chicken egg!

710
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:43,965
Perhaps you have a little problem?

711
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:51,195
You can't hide anything
from me, Mr Li.

712
01:23:51,247 --> 01:23:53,761
And what's that supposed to mean?

713
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:58,483
This - you want Bull Hill
to get what's under the ground.

714
01:23:58,527 --> 01:23:59,801
You're mad!

715
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:02,202
- The coal!
- The coal??

716
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:05,842
You know well about
the rich coal seam down river

717
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:09,516
and you have a large interest
in the coal company.

718
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:13,765
You can fool the farmers,
but you can't fool me!

719
01:24:18,047 --> 01:24:21,835
There's a big deposit there.
Let's discuss a share.

720
01:24:21,887 --> 01:24:26,119
If you don't interfere,
there's 20% in it for you.

721
01:24:26,247 --> 01:24:31,719
Is that so? I'm highly flattered.
So kind. But I refuse.

722
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:35,077
In the first instance,
it's not yours to give.

723
01:24:35,127 --> 01:24:38,039
That land
belongs to the village. Now go!

724
01:24:38,087 --> 01:24:43,286
Robert Wong, don't try to stop me,
there are ways and means!

725
01:25:02,247 --> 01:25:05,319
$1,000 for the death of Robert Wong.

726
01:25:08,407 --> 01:25:10,204
Robert Wong is dead.

727
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:13,522
Martial Arts Masters Feast day.

728
01:25:22,327 --> 01:25:25,524
- Everything ready for the ceremony?
- Yes.

729
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:34,643
See that there's plenty of wine
on table one.

730
01:25:39,087 --> 01:25:40,998
Well, it's you again.

731
01:25:43,607 --> 01:25:44,881
Big funeral??

732
01:25:46,687 --> 01:25:51,124
Are you a masochist, coming here
looking for more punishment?

733
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:52,964
Are you still itching?

734
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:59,476
Yeah, I'm itching all right.
My hands are restless.

735
01:25:59,527 --> 01:26:01,722
Good, I'll bake another dish.

736
01:26:01,767 --> 01:26:05,203
- What's that, sir?
- Filleted boy on stick.

737
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:06,646
Get my stick.

738
01:26:06,687 --> 01:26:08,120
So you cook?

739
01:26:09,887 --> 01:26:11,445
I'll try this.

740
01:26:12,847 --> 01:26:14,883
Good, real tasty.

741
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:16,440
Master.

742
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:20,566
Cheers.

743
01:26:21,887 --> 01:26:24,276
I'll have the skin off your...

744
01:26:51,487 --> 01:26:52,886
Here, bite this.

745
01:26:55,327 --> 01:26:59,718
Wow, your teeth are sharp!
They bit right through the bowl.

746
01:27:17,927 --> 01:27:19,326
Now what?

747
01:27:29,967 --> 01:27:32,959
Be careful now, toothy,
take it easy.

748
01:27:43,727 --> 01:27:45,524
I did warn you.

749
01:28:00,807 --> 01:28:02,206
Sit still!

750
01:28:05,487 --> 01:28:07,318
Push off!

751
01:28:09,607 --> 01:28:12,997
That's called a Fart
for the King of Sticks.

752
01:28:21,127 --> 01:28:23,197
That's called Dog Eat Shit!

753
01:28:23,247 --> 01:28:24,919
Not quite!

754
01:28:30,607 --> 01:28:32,563
No sooner said.

755
01:29:51,447 --> 01:29:53,244
He's pissed.

756
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:31,075
The old man will like this.

757
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:40,399
Teacher, I got some wine for you,
some real good stuff.

758
01:30:40,447 --> 01:30:43,245
A present from the King of Sticks!

759
01:30:45,367 --> 01:30:47,358
Teacher!

760
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:48,642
Teacher!

761
01:30:48,687 --> 01:30:50,086
Teacher?

762
01:30:51,047 --> 01:30:52,400
Teacher!

763
01:31:05,087 --> 01:31:10,366
"Freddy, one year has passed, the
time has come to go our own paths."

764
01:31:10,407 --> 01:31:14,878
"I've taught you all the techniques,
the magic of kung fu."

765
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:16,485
"Practise well and remember,"

766
01:31:16,527 --> 01:31:20,076
"The Eight Drunken Gods
is the ultimate kung fu."

767
01:31:20,127 --> 01:31:26,441
"My home is the world, try not to
miss me. Go home and be a good son."

768
01:31:26,487 --> 01:31:30,685
"Remember, if you ever need me,
I'll come. Beggar Su."

769
01:31:38,687 --> 01:31:41,201
Teacher! Teacher!

770
01:31:42,847 --> 01:31:44,439
Teacher!

771
01:32:07,487 --> 01:32:08,886
Straighter.

772
01:32:08,927 --> 01:32:10,360
Master Wong!

773
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:16,521
Master Wong, Li and his men
are digging up on Bull Hill.

774
01:32:16,567 --> 01:32:18,762
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

775
01:32:18,807 --> 01:32:23,801
You boy, tell my men
I'm up on Bull Hill. Be quick!

776
01:32:24,927 --> 01:32:26,724
This way.

777
01:32:58,647 --> 01:33:04,085
Your skill in kung fu is renowned.
I'd like to compliment you, Mr Wong.

778
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:08,637
Who are you?
I've never seen you before.

779
01:33:08,687 --> 01:33:11,326
Why do you want to kill me?

780
01:33:11,367 --> 01:33:14,837
I'm Thunderfoot, I kill for money.

781
01:33:14,887 --> 01:33:20,439
Today I have a worthy opponent,
I'd like to pay you my respects.

782
01:33:21,807 --> 01:33:26,881
I've heard of you, a cold-blooded
assassin who'd sell his own brother.

783
01:33:27,287 --> 01:33:29,005
That's me.

784
01:33:30,207 --> 01:33:34,041
But killing me,
you won't find that so easy.

785
01:33:34,087 --> 01:33:37,477
Then I suppose you'll wish me luck.

786
01:33:56,727 --> 01:34:00,322
Hands are for door knobs
and legs break down doors.

787
01:34:08,487 --> 01:34:11,240
See? 30% hands, 70% legs.

788
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:54,836
Robert Wong,
are you ready to meet your death?

789
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:10,485
Father, are you all right?
Don't worry, I'm here now.

790
01:35:10,527 --> 01:35:12,324
You're back, you bastard.

791
01:35:12,367 --> 01:35:16,997
I'm a master now. Whoever
insults you pays with his life.

792
01:35:17,047 --> 01:35:18,400
That I swear!

793
01:35:19,927 --> 01:35:22,441
It's you again.

794
01:35:24,327 --> 01:35:28,445
Good. You can help
bury your old man, shitface.

795
01:35:28,487 --> 01:35:30,045
We'll see.

796
01:35:30,087 --> 01:35:36,481
Hey, Master Wong, the day you
fathered that asshole was a sad day.

797
01:35:37,087 --> 01:35:40,204
Careful, or I'll rip you apart!

798
01:35:40,247 --> 01:35:45,367
Dumb-ass, go and clean pig-stys
or I'll have to bury you too.

799
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:50,037
Not me, you bastard,
but the worms will grow fat on you.

800
01:35:50,087 --> 01:35:54,558
Today's my lucky day,
two for the price of one.

801
01:35:54,607 --> 01:35:56,040
Up yours!

802
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:03,077
Hey, hold it, hold it, wait for me!

803
01:36:03,487 --> 01:36:07,321
- Wait!
- Teacher, how did you get here?

804
01:36:07,367 --> 01:36:10,723
Now for some fun.
I must see this fight.

805
01:36:11,727 --> 01:36:16,118
Beggar Su, get lost,
this is not your business.

806
01:36:16,167 --> 01:36:20,001
That's where you're wrong.
It's my business all right.

807
01:36:20,047 --> 01:36:25,201
Don't be afraid, I won't lift
a finger, that won't be necessary.

808
01:36:25,247 --> 01:36:29,445
He can do it alone,
he'll outwit you every time.

809
01:36:31,527 --> 01:36:33,245
Drink, boy!

810
01:37:10,847 --> 01:37:14,442
Teacher, it's very strong,
what is it?

811
01:37:14,487 --> 01:37:17,285
100% proof, the way I like it.

812
01:37:17,327 --> 01:37:18,726
I'm drunk.

813
01:38:10,687 --> 01:38:14,236
I'm the God Lu,
the drunk with inner strength.

814
01:38:24,567 --> 01:38:25,886
The cripple Li!

815
01:38:52,287 --> 01:38:55,279
The drunk with a strong right leg.

816
01:38:57,167 --> 01:38:59,362
The God Lan.

817
01:39:15,127 --> 01:39:19,325
A sudden attack to the waist,
the God Jun!

818
01:39:19,367 --> 01:39:23,724
Holding a big pot in his arms,
Han's gone mad!

819
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:41,361
Well done, The Eight Drunken Gods.

820
01:39:41,487 --> 01:39:45,241
Patience, you've
not seen it all yet.

821
01:39:46,567 --> 01:39:48,080
The God Han.

822
01:39:51,447 --> 01:39:55,042
He's the flute player
with the powerful wrists.

823
01:40:20,527 --> 01:40:21,960
Tough man!

824
01:40:23,247 --> 01:40:25,158
Your flute is bent.

825
01:40:25,207 --> 01:40:27,163
Now, the God Tso!

826
01:40:28,127 --> 01:40:29,958
The drunkard with the...

827
01:40:30,007 --> 01:40:31,281
Powerful throatlock.

828
01:40:32,887 --> 01:40:34,081
I lock!

829
01:40:43,087 --> 01:40:44,520
Go ahead, then!

830
01:40:53,207 --> 01:40:55,277
Now your lock is broken.

831
01:41:07,887 --> 01:41:09,559
The Devil's Shadowless Hand.

832
01:41:11,007 --> 01:41:12,076
Very clever.

833
01:41:15,127 --> 01:41:16,879
The God Chan!

834
01:41:21,807 --> 01:41:24,367
The God Chan won't reach old age!

835
01:41:40,367 --> 01:41:42,562
Where's the drunken Miss Ho?

836
01:41:44,767 --> 01:41:46,519
Ho, ho, ho...

837
01:41:52,807 --> 01:41:55,446
Wait! I forgot to practice.

838
01:41:55,487 --> 01:41:56,522
What?

839
01:41:56,567 --> 01:41:57,966
I didn't bother.

840
01:41:58,007 --> 01:41:59,235
Oh!

841
01:41:59,287 --> 01:42:01,357
Teach me now.

842
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,363
It's too late!

843
01:42:27,487 --> 01:42:28,602
Freddy!

844
01:42:29,567 --> 01:42:33,196
She'll appear without a shadow,
just perform the actions.

845
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:35,397
Watch close and you'll see one.

846
01:42:35,447 --> 01:42:41,682
Try and combine all seven gods and
try and see her as your own Miss Ho.

847
01:42:41,727 --> 01:42:44,480
Ho? You want Miss Ho? Sure.

848
01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:56,042
Go away! Get lost!

849
01:42:56,407 --> 01:42:59,763
This is called
Widow Seeing Lover Off.

850
01:43:05,767 --> 01:43:08,759
That's called
Woman Sitting on Toilet Seat.

851
01:43:14,367 --> 01:43:16,517
You missed.

852
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:25,919
Putting on Make-up.

853
01:43:29,007 --> 01:43:31,601
Pretty girl looks in the mirror.

854
01:43:32,047 --> 01:43:34,845
These are the famous
Eight Drunken Gods?

855
01:43:34,887 --> 01:43:37,879
You think you're
the only master here.

856
01:43:37,927 --> 01:43:43,047
Well, my drunken gods don't mess
around. Nobody can fight like them.

857
01:45:08,007 --> 01:45:11,716
I must be getting addicted.
Here's to Miss Ho.

858
01:45:58,807 --> 01:46:00,240
He did it!
