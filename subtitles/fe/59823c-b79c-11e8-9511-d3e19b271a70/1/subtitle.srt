1
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,631
Like most living creatures,

2
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:22,575
the pigeon quickly associates
the pressing of a lever with reward.

3
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:27,706
But when a timer releases the seal
automatically every 20 seconds,

4
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,087
the pigeon wonders,

5
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,030
"What did I do
to deserve this?"

6
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,333
If it was flapping
its wings at the time,

7
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:39,022
it will continue to flap
conviced that its actions

8
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:41,496
have a decisive influence
on what happens.

9
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,119
We call this
"pigeon superstition."

10
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:00,895
What did I do
to deserve this?

11
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,695
How's it been going
since the last time?

12
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:24,809
- Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.

13
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,256
I'm Dr. Feldheim.

14
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:32,471
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

15
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:34,686
Nemo Nobody.

16
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:37,778
That's an unusual name,
don't you think?

17
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:41,532
Sometimes,
people call me Mr. Craft.

18
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:42,671
Who?

19
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:46,441
C-R-A-F-T.

20
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:51,085
Can't Remember
A Fucking Thing.

21
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,795
What was the first question
I asked you?

22
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,165
- I don't know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?

23
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,730
I'm 34.

24
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:13,243
I was born in 1975.

25
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,842
Would you mind
looking at your hands?

26
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,034
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

27
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,376
There's a mirror
in front of you.

28
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,442
No. I...

29
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,632
What year is this?

30
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:34,890
2009.

31
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:37,860
I'm 34.

32
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:44,261
I was born
February 9th, 1975.

33
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:49,508
So I guess, it must be
your birthday.

34
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:01,006
I'm 34.

35
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,841
I'm 34!

36
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:09,922
I've got to wake up!

37
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:13,269
I've got to wake up!

38
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:34,377
Don't, Nemo.
Sun hurts my eyes.

39
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:25,695
Hey, buddy.

40
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,852
Good morning, my little angels.

41
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,967
- Time for school, okay?
- Hmm.

42
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:35,799
Come on.

43
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:38,422
Elise, I'm gonna
take the kids to school.

44
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:02,368
- Paul, keep it down.
- My name's not Paul.

45
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,621
Paul?

46
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:09,707
Daddy...

47
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:11,930
Daddy...

48
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:15,340
Daddy...

49
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:18,851
Paul, don't wake your father.

50
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,756
Elise.

51
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,382
It's me, Jean.

52
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,209
- Am I dead?
- Go back and play Paul.

53
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,405
- Who's Elise?
- I don't know anyone called Elise.

54
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:39,216
You're so tired, Nemo.
You need to rest.

55
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,038
I'll turn the television
on for you.

56
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm going inside...

57
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,463
- The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?

58
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,131
The sun hurts my eyes.

59
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:08,379
<i>This is Julian Marshall.</i>

60
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,548
<i>Live from New New York hospital,</i>

61
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:15,765
<i>where we're going to see the final episode
in our series, "The Last Mortals"</i>

62
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:21,956
<i>Mr. Nobody is 117 years old
and he has not been telemorized!</i>

63
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:26,947
<i>Nor does he have one of these
marvelous stem-cell compatible pigs.</i>

64
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:30,953
<i>Live on WWB,</i>

65
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:36,767
<i>Mr. Nobody will be the last man
on Earth to die of old-age.</i>

66
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,241
- <i>Mr. Nobody...</i>
- <i>The Last Mortal.</i>

67
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:40,398
<i>The last mortal.</i>

68
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,605
Now, Doctor,

69
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:02,982
no trace of his identity has been
found on the National Records.

70
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:04,812
Nothing about his past.

71
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,548
We do not know
who Mr. Nobody is.

72
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:08,662
Neither does he.

73
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:10,842
Our patient's memories
are confused,

74
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:13,858
<i>but it is not unusual
at his certain stage of illness...</i>

75
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:18,081
<i>for very old memories
to re-emerge in great detail.</i>

76
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,232
Let's try something new.

77
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,487
I'm thinking
of an old technique.

78
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:26,943
I can't promise anything.

79
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:30,194
Maybe snatches of memory
will come back.

80
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,571
Maybe nothing will happen.

81
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:35,673
Are you willing to try?

82
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,404
You are very relaxed.

83
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,929
You hear only my voice.

84
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:53,963
Your eyelids
are getting heavy.

85
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:58,273
Your arms and legs
are getting heavy.

86
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm going
to count to three.

87
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,124
When I say three...

88
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:09,086
you will be asleep.

89
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:10,918
One.

90
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:14,667
Two.

91
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:20,283
Remember
the day you came here.

92
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:26,956
Three.

93
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,299
You're sleeping.

94
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:06,060
Remember even further back.

95
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:08,533
When I say three...

96
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:10,245
One...

97
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:12,780
Two...

98
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,413
Three.

99
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:17,772
Remember.

100
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:26,313
I can remember
a long time ago...

101
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:27,987
Long before my birth.

102
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,248
I was whizzing with those
who were not yet born.

103
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,215
When we're not born yet,
we know everything.

104
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,123
Everything that's will happen.

105
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:16,385
When it's your time,

106
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,533
the angels of Oblivion
place a finger on your mouth.

107
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:20,936
Shh.

108
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,577
It leaves a mark
on the upper lip.

109
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,825
It means that
you have forgotten everything.

110
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:32,168
But the angels missed me.

111
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:43,205
Then you have to find
a daddy and a mummy.

112
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,112
It's not easy to choose.

113
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,339
Blond and blue eyed.
It's all I'm asking.

114
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,061
Andrew!

115
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:51,332
It would be nice to the little one
not to be all alone.

116
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:52,499
You stay here.

117
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:55,674
It's normal to think about babies
when you reach a certain age.

118
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,143
Well, for women at least.

119
00:13:57,532 --> 00:14:00,803
- It's the meaning of life...
- Of life. I had not finished yet, darling.

120
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:02,066
It's the meaning of life.

121
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,088
It's not
that we want a kid.

122
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,178
But we slept together.

123
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:09,230
- It's an important experience.
- It's an important experience, yeah.

124
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,522
I think it would help my husband
if we had a child.

125
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:15,424
We'd call him George.
Right, George?

126
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:17,844
We had a dog, but he died.

127
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,617
In the end, I chose them
because the lady smelled nice

128
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:39,089
and the man said...

129
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,372
Well, I can tell you
how we met.

130
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:46,015
It was meant to be.
Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?

131
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:45,068
Once upon a time,
there was a daddy and a mommy

132
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:47,987
named "The Daddy"
and "The Mommy".

133
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,718
They found a cute little baby

134
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,757
and called it
"The Cute Little Baby".

135
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,011
The little baby was born there.

136
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,257
He was born that day,
and not another.

137
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:01,694
His daddy and his mummy
live at number seven.

138
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:04,534
Everything you see exists.

139
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:06,695
We can see it.

140
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,671
I can see Mummy's eyes.
But I can't see my eyes.

141
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:17,532
The little baby can see his hands,
but he can not see himself.

142
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:20,941
So, does he really exist?

143
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:24,787
Boo.

144
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:29,979
Boo.

145
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,237
# Eenie meenie minie mo #

146
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,373
# Catch a baby by the toe #

147
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,687
# If he squeals let him go #

148
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:40,001
# Eenie meenie minie mo #

149
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,933
# My mother told me
to pick the very best one #

150
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:47,318
# And you are it #

151
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:59,156
The Mummy has a brush for her hair
and lipstick for her lips.

152
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,072
She smells good.

153
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,368
The Daddy has a watch
and hair in his arm.

154
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,947
The watch goes "tick-tock".

155
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:10,998
If the baby falls,
the mother claps her hands.

156
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,882
She says, "Bravo."

157
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:18,182
Bravo.

158
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,707
Why am I me,
and not someone else?

159
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:41,549
<i>And so, high fresher fronts
moving in tomorrow.</i>

160
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,365
<i>It will bring clear skies
for the whole weekend.</i>

161
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:46,858
<i>So, get those barbecues out.</i>

162
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:00,973
Hello.

163
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:05,887
Why do we remember the past,
but not the future?

164
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,526
When you ask Mummy,
she says,

165
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,670
- "Stop asking why."
- Stop asking why.

166
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,105
- "It's complicated."
- It's complicated.

167
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:34,801
It's okay,
I'm--I'm a journalist.

168
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:41,018
The hospital won't allow interviews.
I just like to ask you a few questions.

169
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,314
A friend of mine's a nurse here.
She helped me get in.

170
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:48,986
What time is it?

171
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:51,596
14:12.

172
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,222
Where did you get that?

173
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,768
I borrowed it
from the University Museum.

174
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,176
But it still works.

175
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,173
I've got nothing
to say to you.

176
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:06,160
- I'm...
- I'm Mr. Nobody.

177
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,308
The man who doesn't exist.

178
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:13,209
Do you remember what the world was like
before quasi-immortality?

179
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,123
- What?
- Telemorization.

180
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:18,815
Endless renewal of cells.

181
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,151
What was it like
when humans were mortal?

182
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:27,236
There were cars
that polluted.

183
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:32,612
We smoked cigarettes.
We ate meat.

184
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:38,396
We did everything we can do
in this dump and it was wonderful.

185
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:43,440
Most of the time,
nothing happened...

186
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,394
like a French movie.

187
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,866
And sexually?
Before sex became obsolete?

188
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,197
We screwed!

189
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:02,227
Everybody
was always screwing.

190
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:07,183
We fell in love.

191
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,764
We fell in love.

192
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,910
What time is it?

193
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:23,660
What was there
before the Big Bang?

194
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:24,983
Well, you see,

195
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:27,922
there was no before because
before the Big Bang,

196
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:30,455
time did not exist.

197
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:34,725
Time is a result of
the expansion of Universe itself,

198
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:38,013
but what will happen when
the Universe has finished expanding...

199
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,706
and the movement
is reversed?

200
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,290
What will be
the nature of time?

201
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,487
If String Theory is correct,

202
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:46,920
the Universe possesses
nine spatial dimensions,

203
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:48,814
and one temporal dimension.

204
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:51,323
Now we can imagine that
in the beginning,

205
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:54,039
all the dimensions
were twisted together

206
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,198
and during the Big Bang,
three spatial dimensions,

207
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:58,850
the ones that we know as
height, width and depth,

208
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,909
and one temporal dimension,
what we know as time, were deployed.

209
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:06,628
The other six remained miniscule,
wound up together.

210
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:10,662
Now, if we live in a Universe
of wound dimensions,

211
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:13,224
how do we distinguish
between...

212
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:15,920
illusion and reality?

213
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,831
Time, as we know it, is
a dimension we experience

214
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,978
only in one direction.

215
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:25,315
But what if one of the additional
dimensions wasn't spatial,

216
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:27,307
but temporal?

217
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,078
If you mix the mashed potatoes
and sauce,

218
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,234
you can't separate them later.
It's forever.

219
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:38,349
The smoke comes out
of Daddy's cigarette,

220
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:40,405
but it never goes back in.

221
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,675
We cannot go back.

222
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:50,506
That's why
it's hard to choose.

223
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:56,084
You have to make
the right choice.

224
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:05,177
As long as you don't choose,
everything remains possible.

225
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,594
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Anna.

226
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,645
- Hi, Nemo.
- Hello, Elise.

227
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:20,866
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Jean.

228
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:29,039
For as much as Anna and Nemo
have consented together in holy wedlock,

229
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,224
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company.

230
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:37,098
For as much as Elise and Nemo have
consented together in holy wedlock...

231
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:40,849
Jean and Nemo
have joined themselves...

232
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:45,375
I pronounce that they be
husband and wife together...

233
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:50,586
Those who God has joined together,
no one can separate...

234
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:16,216
Come on!

235
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:20,497
Get it! Grab on!

236
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,257
One, two...

237
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:29,700
- I missed you.
- I missed you so much.

238
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:10,044
Okay, Anna, let's go.

239
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:37,030
Then, the Daddy and the Mummy
kissed all day long.

240
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:03,506
So, Nemo, have you
made up your mind?

241
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:09,287
Do you want to come with me?
Or do you want to stay with your father?

242
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,099
Nemo!

243
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:31,153
I'm sorry,
I-I don't understand.

244
00:30:32,826 --> 00:30:35,929
Did you stay with your father
or go with your mother?

245
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:49,170
- Daddy, is it my fault?
- Of course not.

246
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:51,680
It's my fault.

247
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:03,701
I can give you a good deal
on this type of shoe lace.

248
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:10,143
A very good deal.

249
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:30,542
Remember.

250
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,750
Remember.

251
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:53,051
Nemo...

252
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:54,765
Nemo.

253
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,364
It's time to wake up, darling.

254
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:17,665
And guess what?
You're going to be late for school.

255
00:32:31,594 --> 00:32:33,198
Nemo, it's me.

256
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:39,109
I bet you haven't done
your homework.

257
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:40,949
Hurry up and finish.

258
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:43,879
I invited someone
for dinner.

259
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,891
I'm counting on you
to keep your mouth shut!

260
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:55,046
- How was the trip?
- Uh, it was good.

261
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:59,272
- Have you seen some nice apartments?
- I did. I've seen a couple of nice ones.

262
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:03,176
Nemo, don't stare
at people like that.

263
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:05,692
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

264
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:08,207
He has a gift for making people
uncomfortable.

265
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:09,263
It's nothing.

266
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,567
It will happen
on a Saturday...

267
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,889
You will be behind
the wheel of your car...

268
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:18,383
You are whistling...

269
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:24,039
You do not see
the crossroads...

270
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:28,999
All of a sudden,
a train will appear from your left.

271
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:31,405
And you will be crushed.

272
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:42,201
You're not funny.

273
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:45,707
Nemo thinks
he can predict the future.

274
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,986
- I can.
- No one can predict the future.

275
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,832
No one knows
what's going to happen.

276
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:53,526
I do.

277
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:57,356
Well if you could, you'd know
you were going to get that.

278
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,226
I knew you'd say that.

279
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,501
- It's okay. I'll call you.
- Okay?

280
00:34:05,564 --> 00:34:06,303
Goodbye.

281
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:12,871
Proud of yourself?

282
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,372
Why do you systematically
ruin everything I...

283
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:21,655
Don't you think I have
a right to live too?

284
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:34,483
You could've stayed with your father
if you'd wanted to.

285
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:44,703
Everyone, please!

286
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:47,527
I would like to introduce you
a new student in our class.

287
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:48,416
Her name is Anna.

288
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:49,882
Please Anna, take a seat.

289
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:53,512
Alright,
let's turn to page 215.

290
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:55,243
It's last night's reading.

291
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:58,156
We're going to talk about
climate and vegetation zones

292
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:01,992
and the elements of weather
that are involved in each of both zones.

293
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:05,634
There are five elements that
make up weather as we know it.

294
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:06,944
Atmosphere pressure...

295
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:24,313
You're going to swim?

296
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:28,247
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

297
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,872
Come swim with us.
They're my friends, c'mon.

298
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,228
They're idiots.

299
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:37,935
And I don't go
swimming with idiots.

300
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:43,125
Jerk.

301
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:57,227
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

302
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:11,218
Anna.

303
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,528
Nemo.

304
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,157
Yeah.

305
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,663
How have you been?

306
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:18,576
I'm fine.

307
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:19,964
How are you?

308
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:22,535
Yeah, good.

309
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,249
Are these your kids?

310
00:36:25,788 --> 00:36:26,391
Yeah.

311
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,460
Well, I'll see you around.

312
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:38,020
Yeah, uh...

313
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:40,016
I'll see you around.

314
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:55,710
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

315
00:37:09,882 --> 00:37:11,031
Come on, hurry up!

316
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,940
You're going to swim?

317
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:26,663
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

318
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:33,825
I don't know how to swim.

319
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:34,962
Sorry?

320
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:38,305
I don't know how to swim.

321
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:41,053
That's it.

322
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:44,101
Please don't tell anyone.

323
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:47,508
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

324
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,370
No, I've got my period.
I'm gonna stay here.

325
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,067
Nemo will keep me company.

326
00:37:53,432 --> 00:37:53,961
Okay.

327
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:26,770
Darling? I... I want to
introduce you to someone.

328
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:29,288
- You've already met Harry.
- Hey.

329
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:33,617
And this is his daughter, Anna.
Anna, this is Nemo.

330
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,211
Why don't you shake hands?

331
00:39:04,226 --> 00:39:05,333
How was work today?

332
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,881
Ugh, I can't believe them.

333
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,501
Soon as I wonder
how old they are.

334
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,188
They already slept together?

335
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,722
I don't know.

336
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:40,241
I hope they use condoms.

337
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:43,037
I do not want to end up
with a little brother.

338
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,007
I'd rather die.

339
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:47,693
Is you mom on the pill?

340
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:50,105
I have no idea.

341
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:53,955
We should slip it
into her morning coffee.

342
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:56,249
It's like her hormones
have gone to her head.

343
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:04,304
Sometimes
I can see the future.

344
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,001
It doesn't seem like it can be much fun
knowing what's going to happen.

345
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:32,945
You're still here.

346
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,160
Did I fall asleep?

347
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:41,947
Sometimes I don't sleep.

348
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:45,173
So I think...

349
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:50,000
I think about how it was.

350
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,042
It's all I have left.

351
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:01,602
What do you see
when you look at me?

352
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:06,021
A grumpy old man
who never answers questions?

353
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:08,201
Who mixes everything up?

354
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,817
Who is kept busy
by getting his meals?

355
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,846
Now that's not me...

356
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,457
Me...

357
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:26,843
I wear shorts.

358
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:31,690
I'm nine years old.

359
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:36,316
I can run faster
than the train.

360
00:41:38,988 --> 00:41:42,225
I can't feel
my aching back anymore.

361
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:46,554
I'm 15.

362
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,135
I'm 15.

363
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:55,023
And I'm in love.

364
00:41:58,068 --> 00:41:59,676
I'm in love.

365
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,030
Nemo?

366
00:43:21,822 --> 00:43:22,616
Nemo?

367
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:27,075
Nemo?

368
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:34,954
Isn't he sleeping
in the study?

369
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,835
No, I just looked
and he isn't there.

370
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,438
- Anna, have you seen your brother?
- He's not my brother.

371
00:43:52,038 --> 00:43:53,996
Oh, there you are.
Sleep alright?

372
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:19,946
- Who's that?
- It's me.

373
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:23,105
It's me, Dad...

374
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,490
Nemo.

375
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:26,633
Your son.

376
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:28,573
Of course, son.

377
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:32,221
- Where were you?
- At the shop, Dad.

378
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:34,881
I always work at the shop
after school.

379
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:38,871
You know, a boy your age
should get out more.

380
00:44:39,684 --> 00:44:42,492
You can leave me alone, you know.
I-I can manage.

381
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:44,093
It's no problem, Dad.

382
00:44:45,107 --> 00:44:46,474
I like being at home.

383
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:17,186
There was a card
from your mother in the post.

384
00:45:17,306 --> 00:45:20,892
- You have not read it.
- I know. I'll read it later.

385
00:45:22,562 --> 00:45:24,498
Won't you go
and see her one day?

386
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:27,410
I haven't seen her
in seven years.

387
00:45:27,902 --> 00:45:30,300
If she ever wanted to see me,
she'd know where to find me.

388
00:45:34,183 --> 00:45:35,853
I've got everything
I need, Dad.

389
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:37,973
Everything's fine.

390
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,049
After three months,

391
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:15,650
and six days of travel...

392
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:20,424
the shuttle was heading...

393
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:25,555
directly toward
the Cancer nebula...

394
00:46:27,598 --> 00:46:29,614
in line with Uranus...

395
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:33,208
and its five moons.

396
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,027
It was finally aproaching
Mars and the Colonies.

397
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:02,923
Onboard...

398
00:47:03,814 --> 00:47:07,161
the computer was monitoring
the passengers' artificial hibernation

399
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,382
Elise.

400
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:53,486
I'm not crazy.

401
00:48:53,606 --> 00:48:55,231
Come on,
it's not that bad!

402
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:57,816
I didn't say anything mean.

403
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,322
Shall we go, Nemo?

404
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:05,606
- Excuse me?
- Shall we go? He's such a bore.

405
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,546
You'll drown.

406
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:35,664
- How do you know my name?
- We go to the same school.

407
00:49:36,923 --> 00:49:39,860
You never noticed me.
You never notice anyone.

408
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:47,774
D'you have a girlfriend?

409
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,482
What? Are you queer?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

410
00:49:53,678 --> 00:49:54,948
I don't know...

411
00:49:55,656 --> 00:49:56,970
I-I don't want one.

412
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:01,093
Tell me about yourself.

413
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,413
Or say something.
Come on...

414
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:14,807
Gravity on Mars is 0.38.

415
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:20,382
That's three times
less than on Earth.

416
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:25,637
The ground is covered
with an iron oxide dust.

417
00:50:33,942 --> 00:50:34,882
You're incredible.

418
00:50:37,712 --> 00:50:40,742
- Raise your hand and say "I swear."
- Why?

419
00:50:41,502 --> 00:50:45,377
Promise me that if I die,
you'll spread my ashes on Mars.

420
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:49,938
It's estimated that travel to Mars
would take six to eight months.

421
00:50:50,058 --> 00:50:51,378
Say "I swear."

422
00:50:55,407 --> 00:50:56,267
I swear.

423
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,167
We were neighbors
when we were little.

424
00:51:06,091 --> 00:51:07,025
It's Elise.

425
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:09,262
Don't you remember?

426
00:51:10,176 --> 00:51:11,235
Elise.

427
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:13,943
Anyway...

428
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,737
I remembered you.

429
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:31,225
We shouldn't.

430
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:34,100
You don't know me
and I am not a good person.

431
00:51:34,617 --> 00:51:36,148
Why do you say that?

432
00:51:57,904 --> 00:52:00,097
- Elise, wait!
- I'll call you.

433
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,042
You don't have
my phone number.

434
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:07,090
What happens
when we fall in love?

435
00:52:08,432 --> 00:52:11,183
As a result
of certain stimuli,

436
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:15,532
the hypothalamus releases
a powerful discharges of endorphins...

437
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:19,797
but why exactly that woman
or that man?

438
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:22,595
Is there a release of
odourless pheromones

439
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:25,420
that correspond to
our complimentary genetic signal?

440
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,642
Or is it physical feutures
that we recognize?

441
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:30,504
A mother's eyes...

442
00:52:31,518 --> 00:52:34,172
A smell that stimulates
a happy memory.

443
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,650
Is love...
part of a plan?

444
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:43,022
A vast war plan
between two modes of reproduction

445
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:47,035
Bacteria and viruses
are asexual organisms.

446
00:52:47,155 --> 00:52:49,674
With each cell division,
each multiplication,

447
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:52,853
they mutate and perfect themselves
much more quickly than we do.

448
00:52:52,973 --> 00:52:57,424
Against this, we respond
with the most fiercing weapon:

449
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:58,530
Sex.

450
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,160
Two individuals,
by mixing their genes,

451
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:07,469
shuffle the cards and create an individual
who resists viruses better.

452
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:09,917
The more disimilar
he or she is.

453
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:15,622
Now, are we unknowing participants in
a war between two modes of reproduction?

454
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,581
Okay everyone,
that's it for today.

455
00:53:27,032 --> 00:53:28,968
- Hey, honey.
- I'm gonna be a little late.

456
00:53:29,088 --> 00:53:30,395
That's okay. Don't worry.

457
00:53:31,362 --> 00:53:33,699
- I love you.
- I love you more.

458
00:53:33,734 --> 00:53:35,532
- Me more.
- <i>Me more.</i>

459
00:53:35,652 --> 00:53:37,424
- Okay
- Cheater.

460
00:53:38,678 --> 00:53:40,312
Alright, I'll see ya later.

461
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:40,486
I always liked fish.

462
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,038
I never thought that one day
they would like me too.

463
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:48,672
You're very relaxed.

464
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:53,137
Your eyelids
are getting heavy.

465
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:56,256
Remember.

466
00:54:57,921 --> 00:54:59,334
Remember...

467
00:55:04,826 --> 00:55:06,721
Remember...

468
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:09,165
Nemo...

469
00:56:10,064 --> 00:56:10,926
Anna...

470
00:56:13,612 --> 00:56:16,443
We've got errands to run.
We'll back in an hour.

471
00:56:19,774 --> 00:56:23,218
Anna, cover up!
You're gonna get a sunburn.

472
00:57:38,874 --> 00:57:40,063
I want you.

473
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:42,654
I want you too.

474
00:57:45,183 --> 00:57:45,854
Forever.

475
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:50,334
Forever.

476
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:52,815
Whatever happens.

477
00:57:53,575 --> 00:57:55,253
There is no life without you.

478
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:58,058
No life without you.

479
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:22,886
You look like my son.

480
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:25,622
I am your son, Dad.

481
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:28,275
My son's taller than you.

482
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:48,275
Someone just came in.

483
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:53,055
If I could at least
move my fingers.

484
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,639
Or my eyes.

485
00:59:57,335 --> 00:59:58,933
Do you think he can hear us?

486
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,943
Have you seen any reaction?

487
01:00:01,455 --> 01:00:02,516
I don't know, but...

488
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:04,737
I've got a feeling
that he can.

489
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:05,929
Who's there?

490
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:07,489
What am I doing here?

491
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,382
If you can hear me,
move your fingers.

492
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:11,703
I've got to get out of here.

493
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:14,299
Go back,
before the accident.

494
01:00:43,922 --> 01:00:45,446
I believe one thing.

495
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:52,200
I believe that we should always say
"I love you" to the people we love.

496
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:01,131
I love you.

497
01:01:08,923 --> 01:01:11,940
Nemo... we shouldn't.

498
01:01:13,952 --> 01:01:15,094
I love Stefano.

499
01:01:16,736 --> 01:01:17,394
What?

500
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:19,938
You saw him
at the party with me.

501
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:24,051
He doesn't love me.

502
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:26,274
And so...

503
01:01:26,644 --> 01:01:27,786
I love him anyways.

504
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:30,110
I can't help myself.

505
01:01:31,017 --> 01:01:32,260
I'm in love with him.

506
01:01:35,011 --> 01:01:35,889
I'm sorry.

507
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,687
Dad, I'm getting married.

508
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:50,535
Oh!

509
01:01:51,203 --> 01:01:52,791
And who is the lucky lady?

510
01:01:53,224 --> 01:01:54,199
No, it's not that.

511
01:01:55,733 --> 01:01:58,251
I'm gonna marry the first girl
who dances with me tonight.

512
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,360
Thanks, Nemo.

513
01:03:11,965 --> 01:03:13,057
Nemo.

514
01:03:19,234 --> 01:03:22,731
On that day, I would make
a lot of foolish decisions.

515
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:27,385
One, I will never
leave anything to chance again.

516
01:03:27,696 --> 01:03:30,145
Two, I will marry the girl
on my motorcycle.

517
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:32,687
Three, I'll be rich.

518
01:03:33,068 --> 01:03:34,593
Four, we'll have a house.

519
01:03:35,055 --> 01:03:36,048
A big house!

520
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:38,210
Painted yellow,
with a garden,

521
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:40,438
and two children,
Paul and Michael.

522
01:03:40,727 --> 01:03:43,892
Five, I'll have a convertible--
A red convertible.

523
01:03:44,105 --> 01:03:46,254
And a swimming pool.
I'll learn to swim.

524
01:03:46,705 --> 01:03:50,136
Six, I will not stop
until I've succeeded.

525
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:09,189
Daddy?

526
01:04:10,776 --> 01:04:11,701
Daddy?

527
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:15,189
Daddy?

528
01:04:19,304 --> 01:04:21,037
Paul, don't wake your father.

529
01:04:21,903 --> 01:04:22,824
Elise?

530
01:04:23,636 --> 01:04:25,134
It's me, Jean.

531
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:28,981
Who is Elise?

532
01:04:32,734 --> 01:04:34,358
I don't know
anyone called Elise.

533
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:36,714
Go back and play Paul.

534
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,994
Nemo, do I matter to you?

535
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:46,802
I just...

536
01:04:47,035 --> 01:04:49,259
I just like
to ask you one question.

537
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:52,537
Did you do it on purpose?

538
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:57,909
I found this
on the bedside table.

539
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:03,085
There comes a time in life
when everything seems narrow.

540
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:07,349
Choices have been made
I can only continue on.

541
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,975
I know myself like
the back of my hand.

542
01:05:12,152 --> 01:05:14,459
I can predict my every reaction.

543
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:18,693
My life has been cast in cement
with airbags and seatbelts.

544
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:23,243
I've done everything to reach
this point and now that I'm here,

545
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:25,739
I'm fucking bored.

546
01:05:28,188 --> 01:05:31,072
The hardest thing is knowing
whether I'm still alive.

547
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,632
It is my handwriting.

548
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:43,747
I don't remember.

549
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,925
<i>Wheel of Fortune!</i>

550
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:01,473
Jean?

551
01:06:05,288 --> 01:06:06,624
What did you say?

552
01:06:10,231 --> 01:06:11,495
I had a weird dream.

553
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:14,867
- That is not all my fault!
- Well, it's you!

554
01:06:31,379 --> 01:06:35,028
Well, it's important for you
to understand that in life,

555
01:06:35,063 --> 01:06:39,838
things don't always turn out
as we planned.

556
01:06:40,675 --> 01:06:41,853
Harry and I thought...

557
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:47,129
Life isn't always what
we think it would be.

558
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,000
What are you talking about?

559
01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:51,896
I don't understand.

560
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:54,759
Anna knows already.

561
01:06:57,733 --> 01:06:59,940
Harry and I
are going to separate.

562
01:07:01,261 --> 01:07:02,140
What?

563
01:07:04,235 --> 01:07:05,114
Why?

564
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:10,240
- You have no right!
- Please, you played your part!

565
01:07:10,496 --> 01:07:12,259
I don't know what is going on
between you two

566
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:14,489
and I don't wanna know.
It's sick!

567
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:19,669
- You're brother and sister, for God's sake.
- We are not brother and sister!

568
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:27,715
You knew!

569
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:30,710
And you didn't tell me.

570
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:39,458
Where are you going?

571
01:07:42,264 --> 01:07:43,411
To New York.

572
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:47,624
In ten days.

573
01:07:49,447 --> 01:07:51,438
My father found a job there.

574
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:03,522
Wait for me
near the lighthouse...

575
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:06,123
every Sunday, okay?

576
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:10,112
Until we see each other again.

577
01:08:10,218 --> 01:08:12,144
For life, okay?

578
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:17,316
It's not over.

579
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,057
You're the first and last person
I'll ever love.

580
01:08:30,092 --> 01:08:31,315
Ten days.

581
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,383
That makes...

582
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:37,454
14 thousand...

583
01:08:38,274 --> 01:08:39,815
400 minutes.

584
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:46,414
I wish everything
would stop right now.

585
01:08:48,914 --> 01:08:50,994
Things would stay
this way forever.

586
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:56,375
They say that
if you slow your breathing...

587
01:08:57,932 --> 01:08:59,458
time slows down.

588
01:09:01,515 --> 01:09:03,009
Then do you say so?

589
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:46,272
I have to remember the smell
of every part of your body.

590
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,999
We'll meet
near the lighthouse.

591
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:16,680
Anna, it's time to go.

592
01:10:26,927 --> 01:10:28,225
I love you.

593
01:11:10,638 --> 01:11:13,185
Anna!

594
01:11:47,534 --> 01:11:48,200
Anna...

595
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:50,479
Can you hear me?

596
01:12:11,888 --> 01:12:13,339
We must look to the future.

597
01:12:14,555 --> 01:12:16,299
It will be good
to move house.

598
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:17,980
Have a new life.

599
01:12:18,828 --> 01:12:20,093
Will we have a pool?

600
01:12:21,177 --> 01:12:23,271
You hate water.
You don't even swim.

601
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,747
- You never know what you want.
- You know what I don't want?

602
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:29,424
So tell me, what is it
you don't want?

603
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,665
I don't want to be like you.

604
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:37,366
You know nothing about me.

605
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,475
I've always loved pools.

606
01:12:42,952 --> 01:12:44,400
When I'm older,
I'll have a pool.

607
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:25,731
Anna.

608
01:13:27,298 --> 01:13:27,860
Anna.

609
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:33,232
I feel like I'll be seeing you
at every street corner.

610
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,595
Sometimes I tell myself...

611
01:13:57,575 --> 01:13:59,772
maybe you live
in the same town I do

612
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:01,960
and I don't know where.

613
01:14:02,595 --> 01:14:05,239
Maybe you're here,
very close.

614
01:14:06,263 --> 01:14:09,192
Nemo, do you hear my voice?

615
01:14:11,544 --> 01:14:12,532
Anna!

616
01:14:14,038 --> 01:14:16,857
After 90 days,
the onboard computer

617
01:14:16,892 --> 01:14:19,350
is still maintaining
the passengers' metabolism

618
01:14:19,385 --> 01:14:21,417
at the level
of a hibernating frog.

619
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:49,079
He'd always been fascinated
by the fact

620
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:52,128
that certain frogs can spend
the winter completely frozen.

621
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:54,392
and that
when spring comes comma,

622
01:14:54,512 --> 01:14:58,188
they defrost
and begin living again period.

623
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:02,152
The onboard computer displayed...

624
01:15:02,682 --> 01:15:04,622
"End of hibernation".

625
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:20,024
<i>Welcome to Mars.</i>

626
01:15:20,573 --> 01:15:24,582
<i>We hope you had a pleasant dream
and a refreshing re-awakening.</i>

627
01:15:24,893 --> 01:15:28,956
<i>Please leave your sleep suits in
your suspended animation cubicles</i>

628
01:15:29,323 --> 01:15:32,268
<i>and make your way
through to the Arrivals lounge.</i>

629
01:15:34,066 --> 01:15:37,384
<i>You will be directed to
the rest and recoveration rooms</i>

630
01:15:37,504 --> 01:15:41,461
<i>to prepare for your first excursion
to the red planet itself.</i>

631
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:47,709
Probably the worst thing
about being on Mars

632
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,757
is that nothing
will happen there.

633
01:15:50,449 --> 01:15:52,420
Time will seem stole and empty.

634
01:15:54,061 --> 01:15:56,184
That doesn't look
like there's much to do.

635
01:15:56,454 --> 01:15:58,270
I hope I brought enough
we took.

636
01:16:25,492 --> 01:16:26,227
Day time.

637
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:28,981
It's day time.

638
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:31,703
The sun is out.

639
01:16:33,293 --> 01:16:35,654
It's warmer on the right
than on the left

640
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:43,307
She's different
from the one this morning.

641
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:47,415
Not the same perfume.

642
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,618
Her hands are soft.

643
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:55,119
Elise.

644
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:58,989
Is that Elise?

645
01:17:03,053 --> 01:17:04,958
We sh... We shoudn't.

646
01:17:07,428 --> 01:17:09,240
- I love Stefano.
- Shh.

647
01:17:11,545 --> 01:17:12,629
Don't say anything.

648
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,192
You're the one I love.

649
01:17:17,071 --> 01:17:18,516
You can count on me for Mars.

650
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:21,390
I promise.

651
01:17:57,733 --> 01:17:59,686
Do you wanna go
for a walk or something?

652
01:18:01,497 --> 01:18:03,293
I don't want anything.

653
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:05,449
Nothing.

654
01:18:09,991 --> 01:18:12,587
- I'm so horrible.
- No, you're not.

655
01:18:12,607 --> 01:18:15,812
- You're not horrible.
- I can't stand this life anymore.

656
01:18:16,344 --> 01:18:18,853
Think about it, you've got
the most incredible kids.

657
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:21,953
Stop trying to make me feel better.
I'm actually feeling guiltier.

658
01:18:26,237 --> 01:18:28,200
What's wrong with me?

659
01:18:31,222 --> 01:18:33,095
What is wrong with me?

660
01:18:41,932 --> 01:18:42,841
How's Mom?

661
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,009
She's just a little tired.
She's sleeping.

662
01:18:46,507 --> 01:18:50,318
- She's always tired.
- Yeah, she's always tired.

663
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,226
Is she depressed?

664
01:18:54,002 --> 01:18:55,475
Well, she has ups and downs.

665
01:18:56,413 --> 01:18:57,406
I don't know about you,

666
01:18:57,435 --> 01:18:59,317
but next time Mom
has one of her meltdowns,

667
01:18:59,352 --> 01:19:00,947
I'm gonna go
live somewhere else.

668
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:09,650
So... who has a joke?

669
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:11,992
Anybody?

670
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:14,690
I do.

671
01:19:15,601 --> 01:19:19,750
What's green, small
and goes up and down?

672
01:19:20,726 --> 01:19:22,344
A pea in an elevator.

673
01:19:22,464 --> 01:19:25,526
It's not funny.
Old people humor.

674
01:19:27,692 --> 01:19:28,638
Are you gonna be okay?

675
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:32,258
Of course. Not 'cause Mom's
not okay that I'm not okay.

676
01:19:51,595 --> 01:19:53,133
I can't stand it anymore.

677
01:19:53,924 --> 01:19:56,913
- That noise...
- I'll ask them to keep it down.

678
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:00,545
But it is Joyce's birthday.

679
01:20:03,784 --> 01:20:05,170
What kind of mother am I?

680
01:20:08,744 --> 01:20:09,579
I gotta get up.

681
01:20:32,616 --> 01:20:33,959
- Are you having a good time?
- Yeah.

682
01:20:33,989 --> 01:20:35,142
Can I tell you one thing?

683
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:37,080
You're not allowed to be partying
and not have a good time.

684
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:37,913
It doesn't work that way.

685
01:20:37,939 --> 01:20:39,331
- I know...
- And you know what, Tess?

686
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:40,655
You look beautiful.

687
01:20:40,891 --> 01:20:42,926
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...

688
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:44,488
But your friends aren't
dancing enough...

689
01:20:44,525 --> 01:20:46,923
And your mother has to
take care of the situation!

690
01:20:48,257 --> 01:20:49,181
Dancing!

691
01:20:49,562 --> 01:20:50,281
Yeah!

692
01:20:51,469 --> 01:20:52,436
You, over there!

693
01:21:06,309 --> 01:21:07,848
Oh, oh!
This makes me like...

694
01:21:09,535 --> 01:21:10,503
Like a dog!

695
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:25,366
Now let's get ready.
Take one... two... three!

696
01:21:44,415 --> 01:21:46,201
It was a nice day.

697
01:21:49,341 --> 01:21:51,218
Nicest in a long time.

698
01:21:56,775 --> 01:21:58,395
Okey-dokey.

699
01:21:58,407 --> 01:21:59,704
- Ready?
- Bye, Dad.

700
01:22:00,695 --> 01:22:02,425
Bye. Bye.

701
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:03,895
- Have fun.
- Bye, Dad.

702
01:22:05,223 --> 01:22:06,090
Bye-bye!

703
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:05,200
There's no life without you.

704
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:12,565
Go slowly.

705
01:25:15,642 --> 01:25:17,298
I have to get used to it.

706
01:25:21,209 --> 01:25:25,916
I talked to you so much when you
weren't there. It's so strange for me...

707
01:25:26,938 --> 01:25:28,623
to talk to you for real.

708
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:47,448
I need some time, Nemo.

709
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,941
When we were separated at 15,

710
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:54,860
I said I would never love
anyone else.

711
01:25:55,261 --> 01:25:55,976
Ever.

712
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,212
I would never become attached.

713
01:25:59,902 --> 01:26:01,777
I'd never see
you put anywhere.

714
01:26:02,308 --> 01:26:04,139
I'd have nothing for myself.

715
01:26:07,242 --> 01:26:10,436
I decided
I would pretend to be alive.

716
01:26:15,807 --> 01:26:17,707
And this is
what I've been waiting for.

717
01:26:18,463 --> 01:26:20,111
All this time...

718
01:26:22,355 --> 01:26:26,674
Renouncing all possible lives,
for one only...

719
01:26:28,322 --> 01:26:29,284
With you.

720
01:26:38,976 --> 01:26:40,733
But I'm not used to it
anymore.

721
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:46,107
You know, love... I mean.

722
01:26:49,702 --> 01:26:51,808
I'm afraid
of losing you again, I--

723
01:26:52,243 --> 01:26:55,700
I'm afraid of having
to do without you again. I--

724
01:26:56,793 --> 01:26:58,389
I'm terrified of that.

725
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,205
We need to take some time.

726
01:27:05,818 --> 01:27:08,150
I wanna see you again.

727
01:27:16,029 --> 01:27:17,553
Call me at this number.

728
01:27:21,006 --> 01:27:22,135
In two days...

729
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:28,083
I'll meet you
at the lighthouse.

730
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,382
You wanna know
why I lost Anna?

731
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:16,330
Because two months earlier,

732
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:19,835
an unemployed Brazilian
boiled an egg.

733
01:28:25,296 --> 01:28:29,340
The heat created
a micro-climate in the room.

734
01:28:29,973 --> 01:28:32,481
Slight differece of temperature.

735
01:28:35,114 --> 01:28:39,123
And heavy rain, two months later,
on the other side of the world.

736
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:45,917
That Brazilian boiled an egg
instead of being at work.

737
01:28:46,037 --> 01:28:48,693
He would have lost his job
in a clothing factory

738
01:28:49,174 --> 01:28:50,885
because six months earlier,

739
01:28:51,005 --> 01:28:53,134
I would have compared
the prices of jeans

740
01:28:53,254 --> 01:28:55,569
and I will have bought
the cheaper pair.

741
01:28:55,689 --> 01:28:57,553
As the Chinese proverb says,

742
01:28:57,928 --> 01:29:00,666
"A single snowflake
can bend the leaf of the bamboo."

743
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:05,291
Jeans production will have
moved to other countries.

744
01:29:13,196 --> 01:29:15,812
I lost every trace of Anna.

745
01:29:19,607 --> 01:29:21,140
I waited for her...

746
01:29:22,517 --> 01:29:23,660
every day.

747
01:30:50,723 --> 01:30:51,290
Anna.

748
01:30:56,052 --> 01:30:57,133
Nemo.

749
01:31:13,684 --> 01:31:15,992
I'm leaving!
I'm leaving you.

750
01:31:16,303 --> 01:31:17,237
I'm leaving!

751
01:31:21,304 --> 01:31:22,149
It's alright.

752
01:31:43,778 --> 01:31:44,749
It's gonna be okay.

753
01:31:45,976 --> 01:31:47,240
You'll be alright. Come on.

754
01:31:57,016 --> 01:31:58,783
I often have this dream.

755
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:01,320
Some prehistoric time.

756
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,463
I can hear you screaming...

757
01:32:13,993 --> 01:32:15,422
I chased the bear up,

758
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:17,876
and you're not afraid
anymore.

759
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,110
But when I wake up...

760
01:32:22,564 --> 01:32:23,700
When I wake up,

761
01:32:24,835 --> 01:32:25,872
there's no bear,

762
01:32:27,484 --> 01:32:28,821
but you're still afraid.

763
01:32:29,993 --> 01:32:31,458
And I'm not a bear hunter.

764
01:32:32,722 --> 01:32:36,347
I'm an executive of a plant that
manufactures photocopy machines

765
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:37,811
who just quit his job.

766
01:32:39,501 --> 01:32:40,658
I don't dare to move.

767
01:32:42,352 --> 01:32:43,261
I don't live.

768
01:32:44,902 --> 01:32:46,806
Whatever I do is a disaster.

769
01:32:49,366 --> 01:32:52,076
I would so love to be able
to chase the bear away...

770
01:32:53,072 --> 01:32:55,094
and for you
not to be afraid anymore.

771
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:01,528
To what extent
are our fears innate?

772
01:33:03,112 --> 01:33:05,279
When we hatch goose eggs
in an incubator,

773
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:10,685
and then above the baby birds,
pass a form simulating a goose in flight,

774
01:33:11,237 --> 01:33:13,655
the birds strech
their necks and call out.

775
01:33:14,065 --> 01:33:16,189
But if we invert the direction
of the silhouette,

776
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:19,170
it conjures the shape
of a falcon.

777
01:33:19,537 --> 01:33:21,939
The response of the baby birds
is immediate.

778
01:33:22,379 --> 01:33:26,115
They will crouch and fear, though
they've never before seen a falcon.

779
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:28,603
Without any instruction,

780
01:33:29,327 --> 01:33:32,352
an innate fear
helps them to survive.

781
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:34,706
But in humans...

782
01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:37,774
to what ancient dangers...

783
01:33:38,373 --> 01:33:40,658
might our innate fears correspond?

784
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:16,619
Hey.

785
01:34:17,879 --> 01:34:18,353
Hey!

786
01:34:19,248 --> 01:34:20,181
Excuse me!

787
01:35:03,511 --> 01:35:04,995
Remember...

788
01:35:06,698 --> 01:35:08,072
Remember!

789
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:20,865
Honey, it's me.

790
01:37:34,819 --> 01:37:37,022
Did Elise die or didn't she?

791
01:37:38,139 --> 01:37:39,186
I don't get it.

792
01:37:40,073 --> 01:37:42,391
You can't have had children
and not have had them.

793
01:37:51,864 --> 01:37:52,833
Hi, Dad.

794
01:37:55,006 --> 01:37:55,388
Hi.

795
01:37:56,776 --> 01:37:57,706
Hey.

796
01:37:59,050 --> 01:38:00,673
I'll be in a minute, guys.

797
01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:26,285
- You're not hungry?
- I don't want anything.

798
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,035
Nothing.

799
01:38:31,825 --> 01:38:33,033
What are you doing today?

800
01:38:33,817 --> 01:38:37,595
I was thinking about taking
the opportunity to wash the car.

801
01:38:43,279 --> 01:38:44,699
What's the deal
with that car?

802
01:38:47,034 --> 01:38:48,141
What do you mean?

803
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:52,780
Why do you such good care of that car
while you leave me here all alone?

804
01:38:55,161 --> 01:38:56,590
What's the problem of the car?

805
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:41,891
There's no more problem
with the car.

806
01:39:55,691 --> 01:39:56,731
What's wrong?

807
01:39:57,464 --> 01:39:59,204
Why are you looking at me
like that?

808
01:40:00,005 --> 01:40:02,034
Why are you looking at me
like that?

809
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:08,124
Nemo.

810
01:40:11,938 --> 01:40:15,946
You don't know me, Nemo.
You've never really looked at me.

811
01:40:22,287 --> 01:40:24,233
You've always been elsewhere.

812
01:41:16,883 --> 01:41:18,051
Mr. Jones.

813
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,250
- Yes.
- We already have your luggage.

814
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:23,916
Please, follow me.

815
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:26,449
I'll take you to the hotel
where you can rest for a while.

816
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:28,449
The appointment is at 3 PM.

817
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:51,620
Daniel.

818
01:41:53,026 --> 01:41:54,357
Daniel Jones.

819
01:41:54,477 --> 01:41:56,683
Daniel Jones.

820
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:01,699
Is your name Daniel Jones?

821
01:42:03,494 --> 01:42:05,482
Of course not!

822
01:42:26,675 --> 01:42:27,695
This is weird.

823
01:42:28,879 --> 01:42:30,548
His shoes are different sizes.

824
01:42:41,486 --> 01:42:42,676
Maybe he shrunk.

825
01:42:42,788 --> 01:42:45,076
Times when you get older,
you shrink.

826
01:42:45,295 --> 01:42:47,394
No one shrinks,
that's rubbish.

827
01:42:47,408 --> 01:42:49,078
You got the wrong plug, that's all.

828
01:42:50,025 --> 01:42:52,727
Astronauts shrink two inches
when they come back to Earth.

829
01:42:53,178 --> 01:42:54,297
- Because of gravity or something.
- You think this fellow is an astronaut?

830
01:43:16,026 --> 01:43:18,787
The ground doesn't vibrate
in the same way.

831
01:43:21,174 --> 01:43:22,669
It's a different perfume.

832
01:43:25,103 --> 01:43:26,760
There are other people too.

833
01:43:36,312 --> 01:43:37,737
Let's begin again.

834
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:41,047
Fingers on the keyboard.

835
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:45,845
Left hand: A, S, D, F.

836
01:43:47,476 --> 01:43:50,553
Right hand: H, J, K, L.

837
01:44:50,308 --> 01:44:53,778
- What's wrong?
- I was dreaming about Stefano.

838
01:44:56,894 --> 01:44:58,705
He doesn't give a damn
about me.

839
01:45:05,265 --> 01:45:06,315
I love him.

840
01:45:08,676 --> 01:45:11,267
I can't see any another explanation
for being in this state.

841
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:15,189
That's the only thing
it can be.

842
01:45:17,264 --> 01:45:18,332
I love him.

843
01:45:20,945 --> 01:45:22,223
I know I'm crazy.

844
01:45:24,637 --> 01:45:27,586
Every morning when I wake up,
I open my eyes and I see your face

845
01:45:27,593 --> 01:45:28,765
and I start crying.

846
01:45:32,456 --> 01:45:35,141
I realize that with you,
my life is passing me by.

847
01:45:40,215 --> 01:45:42,265
How can you stay so calm?

848
01:45:42,385 --> 01:45:44,535
How can you bear that?

849
01:45:45,143 --> 01:45:46,471
You're not human.

850
01:45:47,313 --> 01:45:48,890
I don't know what to do.

851
01:45:50,209 --> 01:45:52,041
It's not my fault, right?

852
01:45:52,536 --> 01:45:54,500
You're not gonna leave me,
are you?

853
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,557
No, I couldn't live without you.

854
01:45:59,657 --> 01:46:01,153
I've hurt everybody.

855
01:46:01,985 --> 01:46:03,532
I've hurt you.

856
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:06,350
The children...

857
01:46:07,837 --> 01:46:10,848
- I just can't go on.
- Together we can do it.

858
01:46:10,852 --> 01:46:13,561
If I stay here, you're all gonna
end up drowning with me.

859
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,281
I'll learn to swim.

860
01:46:17,661 --> 01:46:18,724
I love you.

861
01:46:20,594 --> 01:46:21,702
I love you.

862
01:46:24,098 --> 01:46:25,646
I love you.

863
01:46:45,548 --> 01:46:46,747
She left me.

864
01:46:51,253 --> 01:46:53,680
You know what they say...

865
01:46:54,889 --> 01:46:57,575
Everything works out
in the end,

866
01:46:59,532 --> 01:47:00,716
even badly.

867
01:47:25,241 --> 01:47:25,860
Hello?

868
01:47:36,562 --> 01:47:38,966
Not too much
at the top, thanks.

869
01:47:51,808 --> 01:47:53,975
- How much should that be?
- $20, please.

870
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:56,404
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

871
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:11,851
- $20 please, sir.
- Here you are.

872
01:48:11,878 --> 01:48:13,108
Thank you. Bye, sir.

873
01:48:13,143 --> 01:48:15,878
Bye, and have
a nice afternoon.

874
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:42,894
Why does cigarette smoke
never go back into the cigarette?

875
01:48:43,599 --> 01:48:45,899
Why do molecules spread
away from each other?

876
01:48:46,284 --> 01:48:48,632
Why does a spilled drop
of ink never reform?

877
01:48:49,305 --> 01:48:53,364
Because the Universe
moves towards a state of dissipation.

878
01:48:53,739 --> 01:48:55,434
That is the principle of entropy...

879
01:48:55,739 --> 01:48:57,333
The tendency of the Universe

880
01:48:57,638 --> 01:49:00,694
to evolve toward a state
of increasing disorder.

881
01:49:01,086 --> 01:49:02,434
The principle of entropy

882
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:05,364
is related
to the arrow of time...

883
01:49:05,484 --> 01:49:07,849
A result of the expansion
of the Universe.

884
01:49:08,196 --> 01:49:10,270
But what will happen
when gravitational forces

885
01:49:10,305 --> 01:49:12,813
counter-balance
the forces of expansion?

886
01:49:13,518 --> 01:49:16,116
Or if the energy of the quantum void
proves too weak?

887
01:49:16,632 --> 01:49:20,254
At that moment, the universe
might enter its phase of contraction.

888
01:49:20,734 --> 01:49:21,960
The Big Crunch.

889
01:49:26,004 --> 01:49:27,502
So what will become of time?

890
01:49:31,265 --> 01:49:32,400
Will it reverse?

891
01:49:39,215 --> 01:49:40,927
No one knows the answer.

892
01:49:56,057 --> 01:49:57,991
<i>Please take
this oportunity to take</i>

893
01:49:58,026 --> 01:50:00,646
<i>one last close look
at the planet's surface.</i>

894
01:50:03,286 --> 01:50:07,769
<i>Your elevator will arrive shortly
in the Mars transit station.</i>

895
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:15,221
What are we doing
with all those bikes?

896
01:50:16,815 --> 01:50:19,619
They're for export.
Labor is much cheaper here.

897
01:50:19,654 --> 01:50:22,168
China has become
way too expensive.

898
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:26,593
<i>Please proceed
to the preparation area</i>

899
01:50:27,012 --> 01:50:30,310
<i>where you will be reissued
to your sleep suits.</i>

900
01:50:30,658 --> 01:50:33,961
<i>You will also receive your...</i>

901
01:50:34,445 --> 01:50:35,103
Hi.

902
01:50:36,347 --> 01:50:37,364
I'm Nemo.

903
01:50:38,333 --> 01:50:39,051
Anna...

904
01:50:39,869 --> 01:50:41,037
Nice to meet you.

905
01:50:45,685 --> 01:50:47,029
What brings you to Mars?

906
01:50:47,846 --> 01:50:52,344
I'm measuring the distance between
Mars and Earth at it's greatest.

907
01:50:52,782 --> 01:50:55,002
I study time. You know...

908
01:50:55,498 --> 01:50:58,879
Thing that makes it so that
everything doesn't happen at once.

909
01:51:02,267 --> 01:51:03,023
And?

910
01:51:03,143 --> 01:51:05,443
The Big Crunch
will happen in 2092

911
01:51:05,478 --> 01:51:10,136
and people who can't hang
on that long will get a free run.

912
01:51:11,407 --> 01:51:12,364
And you?

913
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,622
I'm just
keeping an old promise.

914
01:52:16,193 --> 01:52:19,366
<i>Alert! Alert!
Meteors approaching.</i>

915
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:21,374
<i>Don't panic.</i>

916
01:52:42,598 --> 01:52:43,865
I wanna wake up.

917
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,901
I wanna wake up!

918
01:52:47,230 --> 01:52:48,860
I wanna wake up!

919
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:53,932
Are you alright?

920
01:52:56,506 --> 01:52:57,811
Are you alright?

921
01:52:59,526 --> 01:53:02,074
When I say three,
you'll be awake.

922
01:53:03,464 --> 01:53:04,476
One...

923
01:53:09,253 --> 01:53:10,259
Two...

924
01:53:16,341 --> 01:53:17,011
Three.

925
01:53:46,003 --> 01:53:48,154
- Mother.
- Do I know you?

926
01:53:48,865 --> 01:53:50,645
- It's me!
- What do you want?

927
01:53:50,945 --> 01:53:52,715
- Henry!
- It's me.  Your son, Nemo.

928
01:53:53,521 --> 01:53:55,125
My son's just here.

929
01:53:57,161 --> 01:54:00,893
I don't know you. You're mad.
Now go away or I'll call the police.

930
01:54:01,549 --> 01:54:02,000
Mother.

931
01:54:02,701 --> 01:54:03,273
Mother.

932
01:54:13,639 --> 01:54:14,862
<i>Nemo!</i>

933
01:54:15,816 --> 01:54:16,868
<i>Daddy...</i>

934
01:54:28,296 --> 01:54:31,239
- <i>Hello, who is this?</i>
- Hello, who is this?

935
01:54:31,945 --> 01:54:33,123
<i>Who is this?</i>

936
01:54:34,047 --> 01:54:35,513
I was told to call this number.

937
01:54:35,953 --> 01:54:37,735
My name is Nemo Nobody.

938
01:54:39,612 --> 01:54:41,164
Is this some kind
of a joke?

939
01:54:41,556 --> 01:54:43,388
No. No, I...

940
01:54:48,028 --> 01:54:49,292
- Operator?
- <i>Yes?</i>

941
01:54:49,311 --> 01:54:53,206
I'd like the address to
123 581 1321.

942
01:54:54,049 --> 01:54:55,291
<i>One moment please.</i>

943
01:54:56,982 --> 01:54:59,182
<i>12358 Alleway Street.</i>

944
01:55:26,349 --> 01:55:28,022
<i>Hello, Nemo.</i>

945
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,551
<i>I'm glad you found me.</i>

946
01:55:31,075 --> 01:55:34,032
<i>All of this must seem
very complicated to you,</i>

947
01:55:34,067 --> 01:55:36,560
<i>but it's simpler than you think.</i>

948
01:55:36,963 --> 01:55:39,297
<i>Careful with the chair.
It is damaged.</i>

949
01:55:45,551 --> 01:55:48,768
- <i>Are you alright?</i>
- I'm fine.

950
01:55:50,689 --> 01:55:52,765
<i>I should have
warned you earlier but...</i>

951
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,380
<i>I couldn't
because of the transcript.</i>

952
01:55:55,607 --> 01:55:56,606
The transcript?

953
01:55:56,918 --> 01:56:00,150
<i>The text of our conversation!</i>

954
01:56:02,474 --> 01:56:05,372
- You can you hear me!
- <i>What you are living now...</i>

955
01:56:06,102 --> 01:56:07,579
<i>is the past.</i>

956
01:56:08,626 --> 01:56:10,383
<i>At least, for me.</i>

957
01:56:12,235 --> 01:56:13,638
<i>I am you...</i>

958
01:56:14,330 --> 01:56:16,855
<i>70 years older.</i>

959
01:56:18,277 --> 01:56:22,369
<i>Everything you say, I said
myself when I was young.</i>

960
01:56:22,595 --> 01:56:26,247
<i>I only had to transcribe
our conversation.</i>

961
01:56:26,773 --> 01:56:29,080
<i>It's all written right here.</i>

962
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:30,707
- I can't...
- <i>Believe it?</i>

963
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:34,821
<i>In this life here,</i>

964
01:56:35,555 --> 01:56:37,291
<i>you don't exist.</i>

965
01:56:37,411 --> 01:56:38,687
<i>I don't know why...</i>

966
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,006
<i>Only the Architect knows.</i>

967
01:56:43,465 --> 01:56:44,457
The Architect?

968
01:56:45,448 --> 01:56:46,795
<i>The child...</i>

969
01:56:47,787 --> 01:56:50,551
<i>The one running
after the train.</i>

970
01:56:51,967 --> 01:56:54,687
<i>Maybe your parents
never met.</i>

971
01:56:58,633 --> 01:57:03,485
<i>Maybe your father died
in a sledging accident.</i>

972
01:57:05,034 --> 01:57:07,308
<i>Maybe you were one
of the vast majority</i>

973
01:57:07,343 --> 01:57:12,068
<i>of those whose genetic code did not
reach its final destination.</i>

974
01:57:15,151 --> 01:57:16,707
<i>Maybe when she died...</i>

975
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,117
<i>A prehistoric woman...</i>

976
01:57:19,386 --> 01:57:23,378
<i>She rolled off the line of heritance
to which you belong.</i>

977
01:57:24,661 --> 01:57:26,194
<i>So for this world...</i>

978
01:57:28,923 --> 01:57:30,493
<i>You don't exist.</i>

979
01:57:32,483 --> 01:57:35,516
<i>If I have made those
calculations are correct,</i>

980
01:57:36,167 --> 01:57:40,111
<i>you need to stay alive
until 2092,</i>

981
01:57:40,428 --> 01:57:42,297
<i>February 12th</i>

982
01:57:43,395 --> 01:57:45,778
<i>5:50 AM.</i>

983
01:58:13,522 --> 01:58:15,473
I'm sorry, I don't know how long
we haven't been recording.

984
01:58:15,593 --> 01:58:17,983
I have to submit my story
by tomorrow morning.

985
01:58:20,483 --> 01:58:22,753
Everything that you say
is contradictory.

986
01:58:24,176 --> 01:58:27,738
You can't have been in one place
and another at the same time.

987
01:58:27,782 --> 01:58:31,972
You mean to say
we have to make choices?

988
01:58:32,254 --> 01:58:34,225
Of all those lives,
which one...

989
01:58:35,819 --> 01:58:37,195
Which one is the right one?

990
01:58:37,937 --> 01:58:41,624
Each of these lives
is the right one.

991
01:58:43,101 --> 01:58:47,786
Every path
is the right path.

992
01:58:50,973 --> 01:58:55,272
"Everything could have been
anything else...

993
01:58:56,349 --> 01:59:00,886
and it would have just
as much meaning."

994
01:59:02,511 --> 01:59:04,904
Tennessee Williams.

995
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:08,657
You're too young for that.

996
01:59:09,355 --> 01:59:10,992
You can't be dead
and still be here.

997
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:13,623
You can't not exist.

998
01:59:20,165 --> 01:59:21,695
Is there life after death?

999
01:59:24,955 --> 01:59:26,371
After death...

1000
01:59:29,558 --> 01:59:35,527
How can you be so sure
you even exist?

1001
01:59:45,083 --> 01:59:47,788
You don't exist.

1002
01:59:49,046 --> 01:59:50,649
Neither do I.

1003
01:59:53,714 --> 01:59:59,989
We only live in the imagination
of a nine year old child.

1004
02:00:00,513 --> 02:00:04,751
We are imagined
by a nine year old child,

1005
02:00:05,574 --> 02:00:08,508
faced with
an impossible choice.

1006
02:00:17,649 --> 02:00:19,014
Run! Run!

1007
02:00:24,945 --> 02:00:26,148
Nemo!

1008
02:00:31,562 --> 02:00:33,002
Run!

1009
02:00:35,581 --> 02:00:36,684
Run, Nemo!

1010
02:00:39,413 --> 02:00:40,721
Nemo!

1011
02:00:46,424 --> 02:00:47,964
I won't leave.

1012
02:00:58,118 --> 02:00:59,658
Nemo!

1013
02:01:05,713 --> 02:01:06,607
You're the one I love.

1014
02:01:18,634 --> 02:01:19,796
In chess,

1015
02:01:21,957 --> 02:01:24,673
it's called Zugzwang,

1016
02:01:26,192 --> 02:01:28,587
when the only viable move

1017
02:01:33,716 --> 02:01:35,750
is not to move.

1018
02:01:45,032 --> 02:01:46,572
Come see.

1019
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:10,218
It's the sea.

1020
02:02:11,129 --> 02:02:14,096
The child is taking it apart.

1021
02:02:15,311 --> 02:02:17,567
He doesn't need it anymore.

1022
02:02:18,699 --> 02:02:22,474
Before, he was unable
to make a choice

1023
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:25,532
'cause he didn't know
what would happen.

1024
02:02:26,266 --> 02:02:29,091
Now that he knows
what will happen,

1025
02:02:31,073 --> 02:02:33,674
he is unable
to make a choice.

1026
02:03:36,646 --> 02:03:38,286
Thank you, thank you!

1027
02:03:38,707 --> 02:03:39,518
Thank you.

1028
02:04:14,284 --> 02:04:20,883
This is the most beautiful day
of my life.

1029
02:04:28,757 --> 02:04:29,286
Anna.

1030
02:04:33,235 --> 02:04:34,191
Anna.
