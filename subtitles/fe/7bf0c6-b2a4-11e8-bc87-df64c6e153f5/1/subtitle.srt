1
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,031
Here you go. $50,000 for your $500,000.

2
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,040
Don't you want to see mine?

3
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, right. Of course.

4
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,403
Of course.

5
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,375
You look nervous, friend.

6
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,681
No, it's just, you know, cold.

7
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:15,992
Perfect.

8
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,900
Very realistic.

9
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,404
It always is. My specialty.

10
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,916
That will warm you up.

11
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,405
Breakfast, everybody!

12
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,980
Morning, sweetheart.
Did that explosion wake you up last night?

13
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,812
Explosion? No.
But the sirens woke me up.

14
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,053
I was having trouble sleeping,
so around 4:00...

15
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,453
...I thought I'd bake bread.

16
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,627
Then I thought, "Wouldn't it be nice
if we had a family breakfast for once?"

17
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,892
So, I did the dishes and made breakfast.

18
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,502
I'd have fixed the bathroom,
but I'd have made too much noise.

19
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,800
- No, that's on my list.
- Norman, that is your list.

20
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,941
Then it's on it. It's as good as done.

21
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,546
Come on,
we're gonna have a nice family breakfast.

22
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,241
Come on, Cindy, hurry up.

23
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,074
I got four more minutes.
Check the schedule.

24
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,918
- You're not even doing anything.
- It's the principle of the thing.

25
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,589
Oh, man.

26
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:57,829
A high-speed police chase last night
ended in suburban Pleasant Valley.

27
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,865
A dozen highway-patrol cars
joined the Metro Division...

28
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,936
...at speeds over 120 miles per hour.

29
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,862
It's not safe anymore.

30
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,237
I think I should buy a gun.

31
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,604
That's just what this town needs:
You with a gun.

32
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,236
Come down, kids!
We're gonna have a nice family breakfast!

33
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,241
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hold it.

34
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,250
What is this?

35
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,119
A pack of cigarettes.

36
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,692
I know that.

37
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,028
What were they doing in your coat?
Are you smoking?

38
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,563
So what if I am?

39
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,233
"So what if I am?"

40
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,934
Do you know what smoking does?

41
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,734
It stunts growth,
yellows teeth and blackens lungs.

42
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,739
Do you want to be a yellow-toothed midget
with lung cancer?

43
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,204
I like to keep my options open.

44
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,739
Hey, Kev!

45
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,913
I've got a surprise for you.

46
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,314
What'd you do that for?

47
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,155
You were supposed to catch it.

48
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,828
You wearing that to school again?

49
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,827
Yes, my father.

50
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,029
Have you noticed something funny
around the house lately?

51
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,330
Come on, Billy, we'll be late again.

52
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,664
Like it's all falling apart,
nobody likes each other.

53
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,909
Norman, this may not be
the perfect family, but it's close.

54
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,038
There's still a lot of affection. I know.

55
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,275
I cook the meals. I run the house.
Do I complain?

56
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:31,824
No, because I love being a homemaker.
I find it fulfilling and rewarding.

57
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,917
Nothing's falling apart...

58
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:38,052
...and everybody loves one another.
So get off my back!

59
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,594
Everything's fine!

60
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,136
Mom! Mom!

61
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,803
She'll be back, son.

62
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,315
There we are.

63
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,253
A bit nutty today.

64
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,827
Just a little back-up practice.

65
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,356
In you go.

66
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,797
Get in the car, Billy.

67
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,727
Can it be a hearse?

68
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,996
Get in the hearse.

69
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,367
Buckle up.

70
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,692
The Green Hornet.

71
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,423
We got one for you.

72
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,994
How did the bird save Baretta
when he was tied up...

73
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,265
By pecking out the number of the police
on the phone.

74
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,898
Episode 23. That the best you can do?

75
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,102
How does he know all those shows?

76
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,850
Isn't it silly wasting your time
on these dumb cop shows?

77
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,985
Why not watch something important,
like baseball?

78
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,315
Silly?

79
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,186
Phil, somewhere in the world,
every second of the day...

80
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,260
...an episode of Kojak is being rerun.
Is baseball?

81
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,988
- Not during the off-season.
- Kojak has no off-season.

82
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,208
A bagel with no cream cheese,
and with butter on the side.

83
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,793
I said no cream cheese. Excuse me?

84
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,507
I'm a good cop.
I show up on time, fill in my reports.

85
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,076
That's why you and Jake team so well.
He can't spell.

86
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,343
Can't you see I'm begging you here?

87
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,009
My cops shouldn't beg. Don't do that.

88
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,351
I don't know how else to say this.
I want a new partner.

89
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,253
You want a new partner?

90
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,920
Jake would be happier teamed
with somebody more like him.

91
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,430
Where am I gonna find someone like that?

92
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,539
I've known Jake 30 years.
You don't have to tell me he's...

93
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,104
...a pain, but he's a good cop.

94
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,145
Please, I'm begging you
not to do this to me.

95
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,809
You're a good team.

96
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,150
Captain, he hates me.

97
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,449
Of course he hates you.

98
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,990
He hates me. He hates everybody.

99
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,486
Hey, Jake, don't you hate everybody?

100
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,563
There. Now, don't we all feel better?

101
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,298
I got this for you.

102
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,899
Osborn.

103
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:43,965
He's in a counterfeiting ring.
He's been eliminating the competition.

104
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,145
- How?
- By eliminating the competition.

105
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,915
Now he's rented a home under the alias
John Henderson in Pleasant Valley.

106
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,052
Pleasant Valley?

107
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,916
I guess he figured we wouldn't look there.
I want you and Tony...

108
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,959
...to post a stakeout next door.

109
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,228
If we know where he is,
why don't we just go and grab him?

110
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,924
You got a lot of youthful enthusiasm.

111
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,502
I hate that.
We don't just go and grab Osborn.

112
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,039
We want him to lead us to somebody big:

113
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,431
Frederick Lutz.

114
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,469
He's picking up a bundle of phony $50s
from Osborn this week.

115
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,379
I thought he ordered...

116
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,112
I thought he ordered a hit on Osborn.

117
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,615
I guess they kissed and made up.

118
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,625
The deal will go down in the house,
so watch for Lutz.

119
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,390
Jake, this house we're staying in...

120
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,192
...who lives there?

121
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,127
Who cares?

122
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,264
I've mentioned this before:

123
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:49,306
Volume 8 of Police Woman
is missing 11 seconds of its end credits.

124
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,305
Anybody else complain about it?

125
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,508
No one else has ever rented it.

126
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,679
It's American history.

127
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,106
Norman Robberson?

128
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,517
Detective Stone.

129
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,954
We need to speak with you.

130
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,547
Did I forget to rewind my tapes?

131
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,283
Come with us, please.

132
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,991
Is that it?

133
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,324
Geez, you guys are strict.

134
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,696
I don't know about this.

135
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,402
Mr. Robberson, you're next door
to a dangerous criminal.

136
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,176
Your home is perfect cover
for an effective stakeout.

137
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,315
Look...

138
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,556
...my family's going through
a difficult time right now.

139
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,956
I don't know if bringing cops
and counterfeiters into the house...

140
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,561
...is the right thing.

141
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,162
The right thing?

142
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,596
What is the right thing, Mr. Robberson?

143
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,436
Covering your ass?

144
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,077
Worrying about the comfort
of the wife and kiddies?

145
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,981
We're all just...

146
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,545
...one inch away from a lawless society.

147
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,351
Know what keeps that nightmare away?

148
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,227
Men.

149
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,586
Lone men.

150
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,059
Men with the courage...

151
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:25,035
...to stand up to the night
and spit in its eye!

152
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,702
What do you say, Robberson?

153
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,082
You got the guts to be one of those men?

154
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,780
Wow.

155
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,088
What'd you tell your wife?

156
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,760
My wife. Yes, Helen, yes, well...

157
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,421
It's best I tell her in the morning.

158
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,761
- Tomorrow? We're moving in tonight.
- I know, I know.

159
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,328
That's fine.

160
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,103
But I think Helen would be more receptive
to all this in the light of day.

161
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,503
Don't worry, it's my problem.

162
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,803
I'll handle it in the morning.

163
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,505
That's Osborn's house.
You guys better duck.

164
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,343
Don't let him see us.

165
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,257
Ten-four. We'll enter the surveillance
domicile through the garage entryway.

166
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,489
Wonderful.

167
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,100
The door is stuck.

168
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:36,636
- What's the procedure if the garage entry...
- Get us in the damn house! Come on.

169
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,276
Sometimes I can jimmy it from inside.

170
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,096
Mr. Robberson!

171
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,853
Come on, come on. All right.

172
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,578
I think that went well.

173
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,489
Norman!

174
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,170
- Geez, that's my wife.
- So what?

175
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,235
Look, I know my wife.

176
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,365
Let me break this to her
in my own way. Here.

177
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,209
Trust me on this. Please, officers.

178
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,409
- It's a goddamn closet!
- I know, but, please.

179
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,646
Go ahead.

180
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,850
Yeah, yeah, close it.

181
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,665
Norman, was that our car alarm?

182
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,426
No.

183
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,532
It sounded like our car alarm.

184
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,867
It was.

185
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,213
What's that?

186
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,575
What?

187
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,651
A noise came from the closet.

188
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,447
The closet? That was the cat.

189
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,982
The cat?
What's the cat doing in the closet?

190
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,389
Who knows? Could be doing anything.
The door's closed.

191
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,823
Let the cat out of the closet.

192
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,459
I can't do that, Helen.

193
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,699
- Why not?
- Because I'm training her.

194
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,302
She was a bad cat and I'm disciplining her.

195
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,973
Bad cat! Very bad.

196
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,741
What's going on?

197
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,710
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

198
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,847
Norman?

199
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,394
Now you're a very bad cat.

200
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,296
I told you to stay in the closet.

201
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,770
Dad!

202
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,005
When it comes to cat training,
you have to be very firm.

203
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,558
You little bastard!

204
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,402
Don't ever throw a cat on me again.

205
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,870
Jake, easy, come on. Come on.

206
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,866
Okay, this is Billy's room. He's asleep.

207
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,914
And you can see the house
right through there.

208
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,586
So, when do we start?

209
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,514
Have we started? Is this part of it?

210
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,518
Maybe I can help.

211
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,623
You've done enough.

212
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,064
Then I'll let you go about your work.

213
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,771
Billy sleeps soundly.

214
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,774
I'll tell my wife in the morning.
I'm up by 06:00.

215
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,080
Norman, save me some water.

216
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,570
Morning, Norman.

217
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,676
Norman!

218
00:21:59,017 --> 00:21:59,949
Jake!

219
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,846
Jake!

220
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,624
I'm a police officer! Remain calm!

221
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,722
What the...

222
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,627
Dad! There's a man in the house!
He's got a gun!

223
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,198
Get away from me!

224
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,040
Get your hands off my kid!

225
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,637
- I'm a police officer.
- No, you're not.

226
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,631
Lieutenant Jake Stone.

227
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,877
And that naked man
laying on top of your husband...

228
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,042
...is my partner.

229
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,048
Ma'am.

230
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,113
Put the plunger down.

231
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,314
Good work.

232
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:19,986
Anybody who screams or runs...

233
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,768
...or hits me with anything...

234
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,331
...is gonna get shot. Okay?

235
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,634
Bitchin'.

236
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,371
Our neighbor?

237
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,371
Osborn.

238
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,381
I know this is your job,
and I know it's important, but...

239
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,212
...I can't let my family take this risk.

240
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,623
I have to ask you both to leave.

241
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,689
Leave? Honey, they can't leave.

242
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,386
Can you?

243
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,865
This operation has already
been green-lighted.

244
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,191
There.

245
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,692
See? It's green-lighted.

246
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,071
Well, now it's red-lighted.

247
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:08,979
She wants to red-light it. Maybe we can
work out a yellow-light compromise.

248
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,411
Mrs. Robberson...

249
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,050
...we're all just...

250
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,791
...one inch away from a lawless society.

251
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,286
Do you know what keeps that...

252
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,355
...nightmare away?

253
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,129
Men.

254
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,673
Lone men.

255
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:41,845
Men with the courage to stand up
to the night and spit in its eye.

256
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,747
Mrs. Robberson...

257
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,882
...do you have the courage
to stand with us?

258
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,422
Give me a break!

259
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:06,796
Mrs. Robberson, we didn't put Osborn
next door, but he's there and he's a killer.

260
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,307
Just last week, he blew a man to pieces.

261
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,138
Now, sure, we could walk out the door...

262
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,777
...but Osborn will still be there.

263
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,273
And your family will still be here.

264
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,386
All right. You can stay.

265
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,396
Great.

266
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,158
Great civic spirit.

267
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,061
That's the right choice, Mrs. Robberson.

268
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,836
No, please, call me Helen.

269
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,907
And I want you both to think of this
as your home. Welcome.

270
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,310
What kind of food do you like?

271
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,346
Chinese.

272
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,177
No. Not Chinese.

273
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:57,012
- They're cops. They eat donuts.
- I can make donuts.

274
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,881
You shouldn't cook for them.

275
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,987
Of course I'll cook for them.
They're guests.

276
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,826
I'm sorry, my guests don't smoke.

277
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,327
It's not good for you.

278
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:11,264
I know I can count on you both
to be a good influence on our children.

279
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,859
Let me ask you: Do I get a discount
if I order more than one mattress?

280
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,116
Yes, sir.

281
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,329
We're in.

282
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,865
AT&T, next best thing to being there.

283
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,499
Mind if I come in?

284
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,447
So that's your window.

285
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,278
There's Tony.

286
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,119
Hey, Tony!

287
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,960
Hi, Norman.

288
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,826
- Ten-four.
- Give me that.

289
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,968
Too bad he closed the curtains.
You can't see him.

290
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,973
I know exactly where he is.

291
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,044
In the bedroom, smoking a cigarette.

292
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:43,517
Wow. You've got one of those
heat-sensitive cameras?

293
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,496
That must have cost a few tax dollars?

294
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,291
A few.

295
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,161
I bet. But it's worth it.

296
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,370
Just lit one.

297
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,937
What if he's not smoking?

298
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,596
I used to dream of being a cop.

299
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,163
Fighting for what's right...

300
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,371
...putting my life on the line...

301
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,170
...saying "Freeze!" and "Spread 'em!"

302
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,274
And "Rico, Youngblood!"

303
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,550
"You have the right to remain silent. "

304
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,196
I'm talking too much, huh?

305
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,161
Good night.

306
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:10,005
What I'm saying is,
if you need any extra manpower...

307
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,279
You're still talking.

308
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,991
Did you forget about replacing
our broken toilet?

309
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,624
Consider it done.

310
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,563
Looks like a regular $20 bill, right?

311
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,704
Sure, it's money, all right. Funny money.

312
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,446
This is Treasury File Number 6827.

313
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,276
United States Secret Service.

314
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,286
The case of the disappearing serial number.

315
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,710
Come on, get out of here.

316
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,210
Go home.

317
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,165
Looks like you have car trouble.
Want a jump?

318
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,205
That would be nice,
but I don't have any cables.

319
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,341
I got cables. No problem.

320
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,212
What the hell is that idiot doing?

321
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,553
In a town like this,
if you see someone with car trouble...

322
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,555
...you stop and help.
If you don't, it's suspicious.

323
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,520
- Where you off to?
- I'm just going for a drive.

324
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,530
It's a beautiful morning.

325
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,499
Beautiful, yeah. Just going for a drive?

326
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,339
No deliveries, no pick-ups?

327
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,878
No.

328
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,643
Just a drive.

329
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,746
He's an idiot.

330
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,620
Okay, start her up.

331
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,491
Well, thanks for the start, neighbor.

332
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,531
Sure, what are neighbors for?

333
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,241
My hands are awfully greasy.
Can I use your bathroom?

334
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,369
You want to use my bathroom?

335
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,375
Yeah, mine's on the fritz.

336
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,914
Pipes are all clogged up
with dead gerbil or something.

337
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,950
If it's any trouble...

338
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:47,823
No.

339
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,594
He's an idiot.

340
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,828
He is not an idiot. He is having
a friendly chat, as he should be.

341
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,867
He's going into the house.

342
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,671
What an idiot!

343
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,415
Boy, you keep the place nice and clean.

344
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,447
A lot of my stuff hasn't come.

345
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,950
I like it.

346
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,455
There's clutter in my house.
I have furniture you could use.

347
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,961
No, thanks.

348
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,562
There's a nice Barcalounger.
The footstool doesn't pop out.

349
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,702
The bathroom's down the hall.

350
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,568
You need to get that?

351
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,581
You go ahead, I can find it.

352
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,984
Hello, friend.

353
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,455
Probably day after tomorrow.

354
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,729
Contact.

355
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,861
- Anyone we know?
- Lutz.

356
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,626
I got your full order
in five different serial numbers.

357
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,738
Still charge a dime on a dollar?

358
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,009
You know you're getting
some bargain here.

359
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,941
Like Caniff got when he blew up?

360
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,743
I didn't blow him up.

361
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,008
I was as shocked
by what happened as you.

362
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,950
He was supposed to meet me here,
at the house.

363
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,612
Where it's safe.

364
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,316
That's right.
Safe as it gets in smiling suburbia.

365
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,754
- Remember, no tricks.
- Right, no tricks. If you remember it.

366
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,798
It's just you alone, right?

367
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,499
Me and the money.

368
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,928
That's good.

369
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,631
None of your friends.

370
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,941
Why are you so nervous?

371
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,479
I'm not nervous, okay?
I just want us to be clear.

372
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,782
No weapons. Both of us clean.

373
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,644
That's what I want to hear. Okay?

374
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,827
Came in yesterday.

375
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,928
$50 bills in five separate serial numbers.

376
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,715
I just want to be ready for you.

377
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:14,029
Wait! Wait! What day?
Just tell me what day. Hello?

378
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,028
Bastard!

379
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,147
Holy shit. Robberson's in the bedroom.

380
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,516
I am going to kill him.

381
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,617
What are you doing in here?

382
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,052
I said:

383
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,030
"What are you doing in here?"

384
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,634
You said the bathroom was upstairs.
I can't find it.

385
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:55,635
No, I said the bathroom was downstairs.
The guest bathroom is downstairs.

386
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,675
I couldn't find it. I didn't know.

387
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,180
Who were you waving to?

388
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,949
My house.

389
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,659
Your house?
You were waving to your house?

390
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,958
You can see it right through the window.
Hi, house.

391
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,060
'Bye, house.

392
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,661
Well, thanks for letting me clean up.
I can see myself out.

393
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,831
Get down.

394
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:34,970
Hey, Robberson...

395
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,207
...you've probably lost this.

396
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,583
Yeah, my tobacco pouch. Thanks.

397
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,688
Great.

398
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,256
You don't seem like a smoker.

399
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,593
Me? I'm a two-pack-a-day man.

400
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,991
I love it. I should quit, but...

401
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,825
Well, you must be dying for one.

402
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,970
Dying is right. I know.
I know I should quit.

403
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,171
Go ahead. I don't mind.

404
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,002
I can wait until I get home.

405
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,642
No, really, it's okay.

406
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,242
- I'll wait till I get home.
- No, no, I insist.

407
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,807
- Please.
- Smoke!

408
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,053
This is a little difficult...

409
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,882
...to do with one...

410
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,162
I never learned to roll myself.

411
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,861
I learned this from a Rastafarian in college.

412
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,137
Where was he from?

413
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,738
Rastafaria.

414
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,773
I've never been there.

415
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,052
I've lost my lighter.

416
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,783
You've got my lighter.

417
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,307
Pretty smooth.

418
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,206
You up there?

419
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,783
You better take my gun.

420
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:26,087
I parked around the block
so he wouldn't see me double back.

421
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,657
Why are you down here?

422
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,023
- What are you doing?
- Trying to help.

423
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,188
Help? You could've blown
the whole stakeout.

424
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,215
I thought you already left for work.

425
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,717
I had some car trouble around the block.

426
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,224
Where's your car?
Maybe there's something that I can do.

427
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,957
That's so nice. I have AAA and...

428
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,826
...they sent a tow truck.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

429
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,305
Thanks. I almost forgot them.

430
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,812
Since I'm already here,
why don't you show me around?

431
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,841
After all, you saw my place.

432
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,107
I'd love to, but...

433
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,853
...I should get to work.

434
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,118
Maybe your wife...

435
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,382
...or kids can show me around.

436
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,891
Helen's gone and the kids are in school.

437
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,999
Then who was in the window?

438
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,431
When we were in my bedroom,
I saw someone in the window.

439
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,276
Him. That was my brother.

440
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,871
Your brother.

441
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,880
He's just in from Bos... Buffalo.

442
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,755
You want to meet him?

443
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,285
He's a great guy.

444
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,884
Jake, come on down!

445
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,789
Come on, don't be shy.

446
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:17,159
Come down and meet my neighbor.
He lives next door, coincidentally.

447
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,428
Jake, come on down.

448
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,183
This is my older brother, Jake.

449
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:39,120
I'm his older brother, Jake.
I'm visiting from Buffalo.

450
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,918
Visiting from Buffalo.

451
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,191
Buffalo, New York.

452
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,462
That Buffalo, yeah.

453
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,472
What was that?

454
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,544
- That's nobody, really.
- There's somebody up there.

455
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,341
No, that's just Tony.

456
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,080
Tony, you want to meet my neighbor?

457
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,869
Tony is...

458
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,268
- My boyfriend.
- Cindy's boyfriend.

459
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,838
We better get going.
We're already late for school.

460
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,850
Yeah, right, school.

461
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,081
Great to see you again.

462
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,519
Nice seeing you. Come back again.

463
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,023
Oh, sure.

464
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,122
Let's go, we don't want to be late.

465
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,291
'Bye, Uncle Jake.

466
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:55,990
'Bye.

467
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,532
'Bye, Niece Cindy.

468
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,163
Take care of my daughter.

469
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,535
Right.

470
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,450
You got a pretty full house this week.

471
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,054
Maybe I'll get the grand tour another day.

472
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,556
Sure thing. Drop by again.

473
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,984
Mr. Henderson.

474
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,425
Did my brother bother you?

475
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,162
What do you mean?

476
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,430
I don't know. Being nosey?
Snooping around?

477
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,339
Acting like a moron?

478
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:43,935
Yeah, a little.

479
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:50,477
He's having trouble acclimating.
He's only been out a couple of weeks.

480
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,221
Out?

481
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,483
Out of the sanitarium.

482
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,455
You didn't notice the scars?

483
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,959
No. Come on.

484
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,362
I guess his hair is growing back in.

485
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,636
You mean they...

486
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:21,345
At least he's harmless now.

487
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,353
Wait, he goes to work every day.

488
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,092
Work?

489
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,996
He drives downtown,
sits on a park bench...

490
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,095
...and drools for eight hours.

491
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:46,037
If he gives you any more trouble,
you call me, huh?

492
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,635
That is really sad.

493
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,379
Life is...

494
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,510
...sad.

495
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,987
The poor guy drools.

496
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,656
Your brother?

497
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,995
You said I had a lobotomy.

498
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,554
Better than being your brother.

499
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,998
So, why did you do that?

500
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:19,264
I had to do something.
I mean, you guys were dying in there.

501
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:22,435
That was good. It was really good.

502
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,008
You sound surprised.

503
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,581
None of the girls I know
would have been that smart.

504
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,180
You don't know me.

505
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:40,185
Now, there are certain things that we...

506
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,590
I'm sorry, Jake, it's hot.

507
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,697
...as law enforcing professionals
may have taken for granted...

508
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,738
...that you lay people...

509
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:53,432
...maybe didn't quite understand.
Now, for example...

510
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,443
...when staking out a dangerous criminal...

511
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,612
Thank you.

512
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,773
...it is generally a good idea...

513
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,177
...to stay out of his damned house!

514
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,656
- Talk about beating a dead horse.
- No harm was done.

515
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,622
No harm done?

516
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,656
But they've seen us.

517
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,593
They don't know who you are.

518
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:18,194
Now that Osborn thinks we belong,
we can't be relieved.

519
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:23,372
That's right. So I am stuck here
on a 24-hour basis...

520
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,337
...playing the role of the uncle from Buffalo.

521
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,811
I'm sorry your plans have changed...

522
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:38,220
...but we're happy to have you here.
I made your favorite: Kung Pao Pork.

523
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,754
This shouldn't be a dinner party.

524
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,592
We have an expense account,
so we can grab Burger King.

525
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,491
Not while you're in my house.

526
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,628
- Give me your plate.
- At least let me help out.

527
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:53,499
I could do the dishes.
Jake would be happy to mow the lawn.

528
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,398
Thanks, Jake.

529
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:58,402
Wait a minute.
Wait one cotton-picking minute.

530
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,073
- You don't give me orders.
- I didn't.

531
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:05,578
Jake's right. He's a proud man
and you put him in an awkward position.

532
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,148
Even if he wanted to mow the lawn...

533
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,846
...it will seem it's because you told him to.

534
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,783
I'm sorry. Let's eat, okay?

535
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,816
You can pass the petits fours.

536
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,253
Don't have one
until you finish your sandwich.

537
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,524
Mrs. Robberson...

538
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,660
...listen to me.

539
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:28,431
I don't mow lawns. I never mowed lawns.

540
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,533
I never had a lawn.

541
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,607
And if I had a lawn...

542
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,438
...I'd kill it.

543
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,183
Holy jumping Jesus!

544
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,554
Goddamn bastard!

545
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,563
You dirty...

546
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,826
Jesus Christ!

547
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,606
You miserable son of a bitch.

548
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,303
What?

549
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,173
Do you have to use that language?

550
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,311
What language?

551
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:20,721
It's not very attractive.
I mean, do you think it's really attractive?

552
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,191
It's not.

553
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:30,733
There.

554
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:35,694
Eleven single-typed pages stating
Osborn has a room full of lawn furniture...

555
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,502
...and has ordered 12 mattresses.
We're getting nowhere.

556
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,243
We'll get there.

557
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:42,879
It's funny.

558
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:47,615
The reason we know what we do
about Osborn is because of Robberson.

559
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,244
That's hilarious.

560
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,248
Doesn't this kid ever go out to play?

561
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,393
Listen, son.

562
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,928
You're getting spooked.

563
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,239
Go away, kid. Go on.

564
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:16,768
I'm sorry my son jumped on you,
bit your neck and tried to suck your blood.

565
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,912
It happens.

566
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,511
You can't behave like that. It's not polite.

567
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,385
Can't you do something?

568
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,793
The vampire game was fun for a while...

569
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:36,925
...but we're losing a lot of blood around
the house, so we should try a new game.

570
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,936
He doesn't listen to me.

571
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,320
Hey, kid.
What the hell do you want from me?

572
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:09,790
How's it going?

573
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,938
My son thinks he's a vampire.

574
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,935
No shit.

575
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,673
I don't know what to do.

576
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:28,813
You've only been here a few days
and already they listen to you.

577
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:31,885
They respect you.

578
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,347
What time is it?

579
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,624
It's a quarter to three.

580
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,298
Quarter to three, no one in the place.

581
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,838
"It's a quarter to three

582
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,703
"There's no one in the place

583
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,441
"Except

584
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,339
"you and me

585
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,510
"We're drinking, my friend

586
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:06,447
"to the end of a brief episode

587
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,390
"Make it one for my baby

588
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:15,862
"And one more for the road

589
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,865
"That long

590
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,334
"long

591
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,007
"road"

592
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:33,744
Don't touch me.

593
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,814
Did you ever catch a bank robber?

594
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,082
Yeah.

595
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,392
You ever been in a car chase?

596
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,755
Yeah.

597
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,758
You ever been shot at?

598
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,905
Listen to Uncle Jake's cool stories.

599
00:52:58,808 --> 00:52:59,797
Look.

600
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,706
Our family's having breakfast together.

601
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:07,644
Uncle Jake,
how long have you known Tony?

602
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,052
Too long.

603
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,585
Blood and brains.

604
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,462
May I have some?

605
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,400
Get your own.

606
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,065
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?

607
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,970
- That Tony's?
- Yes.

608
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,419
'Morning.

609
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,992
I've got to catch up with Tim.

610
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,155
See you.

611
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,090
Yeah, and I got to get to Jenny's, so...

612
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,835
Well, good-bye.

613
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,903
Well, for about 30 seconds
our life was perfect.

614
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,988
Bathroom time is up, Uncle Jake.

615
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:25,061
Come on. I just got in here.

616
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,723
- Sorry.
- Five more minutes.

617
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,459
I'll sell you my time slot, 9:30 to 9:45.

618
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:33,625
How much?

619
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:36,597
$5.

620
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,476
$1.

621
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:43,740
$5 or get off the pot.

622
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,749
You little bastard.

623
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,954
Marva Prescott for Street Cops.
The patrolman's job...

624
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,684
...is often routine, and yet,
with every routine stop...

625
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:01,019
...he knows that around any corner
might be a bullet with his name on it.

626
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,226
The magnetic strip on the back
is much like your ATM card.

627
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:09,070
We run it through and once the information
reaches the station...

628
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,131
...we get a computer print-out
of any outstanding warrants.

629
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,513
He looks younger every day.

630
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,542
Coming to bed?

631
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,781
I want to finish typing Cindy's paper
on Harriet Tubman.

632
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,187
You know, it's really wonderful.

633
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:32,662
Yes!

634
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:37,864
It seems like yesterday I made her
that dancing-seaweed costume...

635
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,527
...for her first-grade play
on life in the tide pools.

636
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,604
They're growing up so fast.

637
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,607
- Billy's doing better.
- He is?

638
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,075
He's coming out of his box more and more.

639
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,204
Not all the way out,
but he's looking around.

640
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,876
I think that's Jake's influence.

641
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,208
Jake's a hell of a guy.

642
00:55:56,986 --> 00:56:00,547
He is. I think he's really good for the kids.

643
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,156
I'll have him talk to Kevin about smoking.

644
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,890
I already did that.

645
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,621
I know that, honey, but he respects Jake.

646
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,223
Good point.

647
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:16,562
No, I didn't mean it like that.
I meant that he'll listen to Jake.

648
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,971
A father wants to hear that.

649
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,805
I didn't mean it that way.

650
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,917
You'll make me miss the ending.

651
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,255
Would you rather be watching Colombo?

652
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,919
Don't be silly. Colombo is on Thursdays.

653
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,724
Oh, boy.

654
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,726
I could sleep for a million years.

655
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:48,999
All right!

656
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,795
That's it.

657
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,789
Had to be done.

658
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,290
That was great, Uncle Jake.

659
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,028
Billy, you sure you're okay?

660
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,757
No sweat.

661
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,895
Jake, you got ketchup all over him.

662
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,765
What do you want to play now?

663
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,304
Thank you very much.

664
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,836
I just wanted to get him to leave me alone.

665
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,318
Jake? Tony?

666
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,986
I'm in the bathroom.
I'll be there in a minute.

667
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,018
Freeze!

668
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,380
I said, "Freeze!"

669
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,953
Detective Norman Stone.
Put your hands up and spread 'em.

670
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,956
I said, "Spread 'em!"

671
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,097
You talking to me?

672
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,963
You talking to me?

673
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:30,833
You talk me?

674
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:32,902
You? Me?

675
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,037
Norman.

676
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:45,352
"Happy birthday to you

677
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,154
"Happy birthday to you

678
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,257
"Happy birthday, dear Jake

679
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,364
"Happy birthday to you"

680
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:07,006
Blow out your candles
and then you can open your present.

681
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,944
If you don't blow them out, I will.

682
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,141
There. Now make a wish.
Come on, make a wish.

683
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,184
You're not making a wish.

684
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,080
I wish...

685
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,382
...that you'd leave me alone.

686
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,776
We'll just eat it without him.

687
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,372
You okay, Mom?

688
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:45,566
Freeze! Hands up! You're under arrest!

689
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,146
Pow!

690
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,947
I've been shot! Call the paramedics!

691
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,449
- Guess what.
- Call 911.

692
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:59,248
- Our bathroom's fixed.
- No way. Our bathroom?

693
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,322
Oh, this is so cool. Look at this.

694
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,251
Mom, look.

695
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,588
Check it out.

696
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,993
Great! Norman.

697
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:11,264
Norman, did you see what Jake did?

698
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,001
The toilet?

699
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:19,070
Yes, that means we have two that work.
We're a normal family again.

700
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,540
Hands up! Don't make me use this!

701
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,278
You okay, Dad?

702
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,215
Yeah, fine.

703
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,420
Do you want to talk about it?

704
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,488
No, I'm fine.

705
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,158
I used to get sad sometimes, too.

706
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:43,094
When I was little,
I thought people liked Kevin more than me.

707
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,161
Don't be silly.

708
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,632
Because he could do so many cool things.

709
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,039
Then I realized, "Hey, I'm only five. "

710
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,103
How old are you, Dad?

711
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:57,240
I'm about 12.

712
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,452
Mind if I play with Uncle Jake?

713
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,119
No, go ahead.

714
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:11,059
Uncle Jake, want to come outside
and play with me?

715
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,162
Yeah, let me finish this coffee.

716
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,930
Whatever you say, Uncle Jake.

717
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:17,932
Uncle Jake.

718
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,080
7-8-5-1, family dispute.

719
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,956
Now, please listen.

720
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,557
I want a bagel with no cream cheese,
just butter, okay?

721
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,429
No cream cheese, whatsoever.

722
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:54,658
Right.

723
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,665
Maybe you better write it down.

724
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,565
Maybe.

725
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,971
Bagel for the counter.

726
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:14,281
Enjoy.

727
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,122
Okay.

728
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,462
I'll pay for this bagel,
but you'll never see me in here again.

729
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,634
Yeah, you're breaking my heart.

730
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,571
And if you want a tip, I got news for you.

731
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,116
You're under arrest.

732
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,151
Gee, I'm scared!

733
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,625
You want to hurry? You're backing me up.

734
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:53,284
Give me potato salad.
Where's the pickles?

735
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:57,396
We need pickles. Not coleslaw,
I said potato salad.

736
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,591
Did you hear me? I said potato salad.

737
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,761
You're under arrest. Freeze!

738
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,040
- He has a knife!
- No, a gun!

739
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,632
- Don't shoot.
- Put your hands behind my back.

740
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,568
No, straight up. Reach for the tiling.

741
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,170
Relax, everybody.

742
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,182
The show's over.
Detective Norm Stone here.

743
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:20,319
Stick your hands behind your back.
Don't try anything.

744
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,209
I want to see a lawyer.

745
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,355
You arrested a waiter?

746
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,485
That's right.

747
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,220
May I ask why?

748
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,559
One thing, his service stunk.

749
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,288
It stunk!

750
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,826
Come here.

751
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,838
You're nuts, do you know that?

752
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,242
Jake, he was rude.

753
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,639
You can't arrest people for being rude.

754
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:19,507
If we did, all of New York City
would be on death row.

755
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,181
I have a hunch about this guy.

756
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,442
A what?

757
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,782
A hunch. You know,
like a cop kind of a hunch.

758
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,850
Let's take him downtown
and interrogate him.

759
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:34,787
But he's not hiding anything.
Stop talking like a dumb TV detective.

760
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:39,630
- You be good cop, I'm bad cop.
- You are not a cop!

761
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:45,339
Give me my badge
and the key to the cuffs.

762
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,378
Now, get in.

763
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,749
Get in!

764
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,549
- Just look at...
- Get in!

765
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:04,917
Stay!

766
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,162
Quiet!

767
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:13,759
- Just check his file.
- Don't say another word.

768
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:18,566
If I even see you breathe,
I'll shoot you myself.

769
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,390
How you doing tonight?

770
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,366
How am I doing? I'm suing.

771
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,864
Yeah, I'm suing him. I'm suing you.

772
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,798
I'm suing the entire police department!

773
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,870
That's how I'm doing tonight.

774
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,214
What's your badge number?

775
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:37,783
I can't believe this is possible
in a democratic society.

776
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,915
I've had it with you
and your stupid partner.

777
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:44,622
You're finished.
You'll be a K-Mart security guard...

778
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,455
...when I'm done with you!

779
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,855
- Take it easy, sir. These mistakes...
- Jake?

780
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,012
What?

781
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:05,939
What?

782
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,676
Book him, Danno.

783
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,416
Arresting officer, Jake Stone.

784
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:20,359
- I want to report a stolen car.
- Take a number.

785
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,959
It's the biggest car-theft ring in the valley.

786
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,901
How did you make him?

787
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:31,598
Get your hands off of me!
I said get 'em off me!

788
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,704
It was a hunch.

789
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:37,835
That was so great.

790
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,605
You got lucky, Norman.

791
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:43,582
It wasn't luck, Jake.
I was born to be a cop.

792
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,312
This was the most exciting day of my life.

793
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,588
You think being a cop is exciting?

794
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:57,528
I know it's not all excitement
like Starsky and Hutch and T.J. Hooker.

795
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:01,568
A lot of it's tedious and bureaucratic,
like in Law and Order.

796
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,036
It's nothing like television.

797
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,874
I'll tell you what it's like.

798
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:25,360
It's being afraid of dying
every second of every day.

799
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,021
Do you understand that?

800
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:36,030
You stole my badge, Norman.

801
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,099
Yeah, I'm sorry.

802
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:43,642
They could've busted me for what you did.
I could've lost my pension.

803
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,777
Then what the hell would I do?

804
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:52,649
Jesus, I'm sorry, Jake.
Is there anything I can do?

805
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,658
Get the hell out of my life.

806
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,998
I can understand that, but...

807
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:04,660
But what?

808
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,067
You're living in my house.

809
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,538
I'll show you something great.

810
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,602
This one's cool.
This is an X-ray scope. I can see...

811
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,605
Stop that.

812
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,406
Jake!

813
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,943
That was quick. You're back, huh?

814
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,089
My shift, smoke them if you got them.

815
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,425
He's been in the house all day.

816
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,558
Do you mind if we go for a drive?

817
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,965
I'll be 20 minutes. I'm starving.
I'll bring the beeper.

818
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:40,696
Do you want anything?

819
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,700
Yeah, bring me some fries.

820
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,659
- You got one for me?
- No.

821
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,835
Come on, don't be like Dad.

822
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,836
Me and your dad are nothing alike.

823
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,501
There's a shocker.

824
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:29,917
Your dad doesn't want you to smoke
because he's afraid you'll get cancer.

825
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,489
I don't want you to have it
because it's my last one.

826
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,591
The difference between me and him is...

827
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,187
...I don't give a shit about you...

828
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,000
...and he does.

829
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:50,930
We're leaving.

830
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:52,938
Why? What are you afraid of?

831
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:56,939
I'm afraid of the moral implications
of your dress.

832
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:04,677
I'm not a child. I'm a grown woman.

833
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:09,288
Do you know what it's like
to be trapped in this teenage body?

834
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:12,026
I'm imagining it.

835
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:17,158
Jesus, Tony!

836
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:23,899
That's my gun.
You don't need to be afraid of it.

837
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,199
You just need to know how to use it.

838
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,907
You want me to show you how to use it?

839
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:31,579
Sure.

840
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,744
I'll get rid of the bullets.

841
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:55,904
Yeah.

842
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,232
Hello, friend.

843
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:58,997
Is that you?

844
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,111
I didn't want to drop in
without calling first.

845
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,644
That's smart.

846
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,879
- You alone?
- Isn't that what you wanted?

847
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:13,311
If I didn't know better...

848
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,014
...I'd think you didn't trust me.

849
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,587
Of course I trust you.

850
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,358
Why wouldn't I trust you?

851
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,995
You got the stuff?

852
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,296
I got everything you need, pal.

853
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:32,706
That's good because
I got everything you need, too.

854
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:36,106
So, why don't you come in?

855
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,709
Great.

856
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,689
Tony.

857
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,662
Where the hell are you, Tony?

858
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,195
If Jake saw this, I'd be dead.

859
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:09,978
It's going down.

860
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,412
Everything is set up downstairs.

861
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,288
I'd like to use the john first.

862
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,922
Good. The bathroom is downstairs.

863
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:29,956
Lead the way.

864
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:31,960
My pleasure.

865
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:38,103
You going to get that?

866
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,870
It's probably somebody selling something.

867
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,038
It might be important.

868
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,716
I'll get rid of them.

869
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,780
I'll find my own way.

870
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,185
No.

871
01:14:57,092 --> 01:15:01,188
It's very tricky down there, you know?

872
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:07,367
I'll get you some Taster's Choice and relax.

873
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,110
What?

874
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:19,044
Is this Mr. John Henderson?

875
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:22,140
Yes, but I don't accept phone solicitations.

876
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,486
No, Mr. Henderson.

877
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,412
I'm calling to offer you a free trip to Maui.

878
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,324
I don't care what it is.

879
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:32,325
Did you say Maui?

880
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,924
Maui, huh? I heard of that.

881
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,927
That's one of the less developed islands.

882
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,099
You're under arrest. Freeze!

883
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:44,430
Spread 'em!

884
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,908
Go away, you stupid little kid.

885
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:51,101
I'm not a little kid!
I'm a cop, like my Uncle Jake.

886
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,524
You know, I've never won anything before.

887
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,323
Can I bring a guest?

888
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,121
Do you have a credit card with you?

889
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,366
Well, no, I don't have it with me, but...

890
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,061
Then forget the trip, you asshole!

891
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,535
How long has Uncle Jake
been staying with you?

892
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:23,310
About five days.

893
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,207
Is the kid bothering you?

894
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,475
- First he's a vampire, now this.
- Hi, Uncle Jake.

895
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,385
He's a handful. Hi.

896
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,784
Billy, it's time for bed.

897
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,216
That's all right, Uncle Jake.

898
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,994
You said this place was clean.

899
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:49,998
Yeah, it is.

900
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,968
Then why is there a stakeout next door?

901
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,270
I'm taking you to find out
what you got on us.

902
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,039
You stay here and watch the kid.

903
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:01,913
Don't worry about him.
He has his own gun.

904
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:11,249
That's not true. I don't have a gun.
I don't believe in them.

905
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,488
Bullshit.

906
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:18,967
You stay and watch the kid.

907
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,024
You all right?

908
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,937
Ten-four.

909
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,616
Come on.

910
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,855
That must be Lutz's car.

911
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:50,593
Hi, Jake. Have you seen Billy?

912
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:58,066
Where's the stakeout?

913
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,939
- Upstairs.
- Everybody, upstairs.

914
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,072
Wait, Tony!

915
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,316
Shit!

916
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:12,387
Come on in. Close it.

917
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:14,180
Shut up.

918
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:25,662
Shut the door. Welcome to the party.

919
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,261
Anybody else?

920
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:37,902
That could be the station.

921
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,976
Answer it and be careful what you say.

922
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,109
Hi, it's Norman. Is Helen there?

923
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,616
I want to tell her why I'm not home.

924
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,386
I don't know.

925
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,018
10:00, 10:15.

926
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:56,961
Excuse me?

927
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,531
I said, "10:15."

928
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:08,072
Some friend from that stupid rock group.
I said you wouldn't be home till after 10:00.

929
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:12,040
He said they'd come by. Is that okay?

930
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:15,316
Okay, everybody next door. Move it!

931
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:19,010
10:00, 10:15...

932
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,999
Breaker, this is Man from Uncle
with a distress call.

933
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:38,069
- Do you read?
- Is this for real?

934
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:41,332
This is an emergency. Call the police.

935
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,011
Tell Captain Corbett you talked
to Norman Robberson.

936
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:47,545
Tell him there's trouble at Osborn's.

937
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,580
He's got my family hostage.

938
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,416
I'm sure you don't want to hurt anyone.

939
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,681
Save your breath. He's got to kill us.

940
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,149
If we all put our heads together...

941
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,158
He'll enjoy it because he's a killer.

942
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:07,292
He can wear all the fancy suits he wants,
but inside he's just a street punk.

943
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,063
Is this really the time to pick on him?

944
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,376
Who is this one?

945
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,054
That's just her boyfriend.

946
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:30,520
Get down. No talking.

947
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:35,593
Now I've got to whack an entire
middle-class suburban family.

948
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,355
People will notice this.

949
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:18,796
Where is your big one with the silencer?

950
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,369
I thought you didn't have a gun.

951
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:24,778
You need a gun these days,
to protect yourself.

952
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:27,639
This was to be a friendly meeting.

953
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:29,583
Then why'd you bring a gun?

954
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,615
Yeah, that's right.

955
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:55,400
What was that?

956
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:01,512
Check it out.

957
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,448
You check it out.

958
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,416
Come on, this is ridiculous.

959
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:13,617
We're acting like we don't trust each other.

960
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,426
Let's leave the family.

961
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,135
We'll go look together.

962
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:22,627
Good idea.

963
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:24,866
Come on, let's go.

964
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,238
Little too far to the left.

965
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,280
All right, let's just do this.

966
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:09,682
Now, where is a good place?

967
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:19,521
In the basement.
I got the walls lined with mattresses.

968
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,227
They'll muffle the shots.

969
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,757
You sure?

970
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:25,524
Of course, I'm sure. I tried it myself.

971
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,662
I was bored. I was just bored.

972
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:35,436
I was waiting for him
and I was very bored waiting.

973
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:36,805
All right, all right.

974
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,514
All right, who goes first?

975
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,544
The girl.

976
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,275
Freeze!

977
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:12,747
You drop it.

978
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:28,585
You shot me again, you putz!

979
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:30,424
I didn't, I shot him.

980
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:33,359
Now you woke the whole neighborhood!

981
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:35,763
- You should have watched him!
- I did!

982
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:37,370
Then where is he?

983
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,313
Norman?

984
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,726
You drop it. Drop it.

985
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:02,792
- Come on. Drop it.
- I'll shoot you.

986
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:05,499
Drop it or I'll shoot Mommy and Daddy.

987
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:10,033
Go ahead, drop it. Drop your gun
or you'll all go back to Buffalo.

988
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:13,464
Buffalo, New York,
you said you were from?

989
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:17,511
That's it. Very good.
Now you're being smart.

990
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:21,338
Everything was perfect here.
You had to come late.

991
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:22,481
You!

992
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:24,640
Drop it!

993
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,598
You don't know how to use that.

994
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,930
Come on, Mommy, you shoot.

995
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,526
Shoot it.

996
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,365
Listen, dick.

997
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:47,837
If I can make lobster-crab souffl
without having it fall...

998
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:50,467
...I can sure as shit work this silly machine.

999
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:01,854
Now drop the gun,
and don't make Mommy tell you twice.

1000
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:06,584
I don't know what happened.
I had it planned.

1001
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:07,990
She meant the gun.

1002
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:09,654
It was all planned the right way.

1003
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,065
I don't want to hurt anybody.

1004
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:13,993
Give me that gun!

1005
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:17,798
Jake, he's had enough!

1006
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,442
You're okay, Helen.

1007
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,678
Want a cigarette?

1008
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,489
Jake.

1009
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:38,889
Don't push your luck.

1010
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,696
Dad, are you okay?

1011
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:52,496
Billy.

1012
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,172
You've grown.

1013
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:01,138
Kevin, have you been smoking?

1014
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:03,916
Look what happened. I warned you.

1015
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,815
Dad, that's Kevin.

1016
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:09,056
Mother?

1017
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:14,662
Don't worry. We'll get you to a hospital.

1018
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:17,059
Yeah. Daddy, I love you.

1019
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,196
We all love you.

1020
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:24,870
Mom?

1021
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,839
You've milked it enough.

1022
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,042
This is the police.

1023
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,069
Cool.

1024
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:36,677
Release your hostages
and come out of the house.

1025
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,614
This is Marva Prescott for Street Cops.

1026
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:44,757
The well-manicured lawns of suburbia
were stricken with fear today.

1027
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,229
Go. Get out. Go. Move.

1028
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:51,157
Take it easy, would you?

1029
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:54,830
- What happened?
- What happened is you're a moron!

1030
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:57,933
Let's get a shot of the distraught family.

1031
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,902
Excuse me, we have a deadline.
Wife, teenage daughter...

1032
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,579
It's Street Cops. We're on Street Cops.

1033
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:21,795
We're on Street Cops.

1034
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,995
Smile, brother.

1035
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:29,264
You first, Jake.

1036
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:33,003
Now, smile.
