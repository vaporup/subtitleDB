I like you.

175
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:10,650
I have from the beginning.

176
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:22,176
[Murmuring]

177
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,419
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- All: Mr. President.

178
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:31,173
I'm aware that what I have to
tell you may conceivably create

179
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,696
- somewhat wider than the Grand Canyon.
- [Laughing]

180
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:37,349
Nonetheless, it is true.
Yesterday, a U.S. spacecraft

181
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,520
splashed down off
the Southern California coast.

182
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,477
It was one of two that
have been missing in space

183
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,430
for over 2 years now.

184
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,367
To be exact, the one commanded
by Colonel Taylor.

185
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,936
[Murmuring]

186
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,149
Have they identified the bodies,
Mr. President?

187
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:56,010
They have identified
3 bodies, yes, all living.

188
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:57,841
[Murmuring]

189
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:01,359
At the time of their rescue,
through an unfortunate accident

190
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:04,368
one of them was killed early
this morning in the Los Angeles Zoo.

191
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,711
- Zoo?
- What would astronauts

192
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,918
be doing in a zoo,
Mr. President?

193
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:12,731
They are not astronauts,
General Faulkner.

194
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:15,166
- They are apes.
- [Murmuring]

195
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,087
Chimpanzees,
to be more precise.

196
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:19,739
They're harmless, friendly,
and by all reports

197
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,266
extremely intelligent
and sophisticated creatures.

198
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:24,195
But naturally, being animals,

199
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,327
they cannot tell us
where the ship came from

200
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:29,635
or how they
came to be in it.

201
00:20:29,702 --> 00:20:31,711
I have, therefore,
decided to convene

202
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:35,080
a Presidential Commission of lnquiry
in Los Angeles tomorrow.

203
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,602
The 2 surviving apes

204
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:40,523
will be presented to the commission
for their inspection.

205
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:43,851
The press will be invited to attend,
not to participate.

206
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:46,919
I don't believe
that we can withhold

207
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:51,728
this extraordinary discovery
from the world any longer.

208
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:53,650
[Speaking French]

209
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,861
[Speaking German]

210
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,432
[Speaking Japanese]

211
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,259
One of the 2
American spaceships

212
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:13,714
believed until now to have
disintegrated in orbit,

213
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,987
splashed down unexpectedly yesterday
in the Pacific Ocean

214
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:18,998
off the coast
of Southern California.

215
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:22,041
And is stated
to have been manned--

216
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,826
if you can call it manned--
by monkeys.

217
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:28,162
Reporters:
General!

218
00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:30,597
No comment.
I have nothing to say, gentlemen.

219
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,671
- Reporters: Senator!
- I'm sorry, boys, not now.

220
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:34,751
I haven't the time now.
A little later, please.

221
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,713
Reporter:
Here comes the chairman.

222
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,634
Later. Later.

223
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,778
As the president's
senior science advisor,

224
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,492
what do you expect to experience
from this historic meeting?

225
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,431
- Fear.
- [All Talking At Once]

226
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,835
All right now,
after I break the news,

227
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,585
I want you to start slowly
with simple answers to what will

228
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,760
certainly be
simple questions.

229
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,483
And if the questions
become less simple?

230
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:10,516
- Be yourself.
- Your better self, Zira.

231
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:13,523
- Please.
- [Knock]

232
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:15,452
All right, it's time.

233
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,965
What do they think
we are, gorillas?

234
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:22,072
I'm sorry.

235
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:36,771
That's it.
Just be seated.

236
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,285
Uh, Mr. Chairman,
members of the commission,

237
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,393
Iadies and gentlemen,
my name is Lewis Dixon.

238
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,571
And I am
the animal psychiatrist

239
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:49,009
who has been in charge
of these 2 apes

240
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:51,279
since they came to
the Los Angeles Zoo.

241
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:54,066
My associate,
Dr. Stephanie Branton

242
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:56,239
and I are ready
to answer your questions.

243
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,628
What may astonish you
is that, um,

244
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:01,615
our chimpanzee friends

245
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:04,822
are ready to answer
your questions too.

246
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,477
Not by signs, not by looks,
or movements,

247
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:10,004
but by words.

248
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:11,933
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

249
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,771
[Gavel Strikes Bench]

250
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,973
Dr. Dixon, as a zoologist,
I know and respect your work,

251
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,531
but if you think you're going to turn
a presidential inquiry

252
00:23:21,603 --> 00:23:24,026
into a ventriloquist's act,
I have to inform you--

253
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,956
And I have to inform you, sir,
that these two apes

254
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:27,877
have acquired
the power of speech.

255
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:30,082
Come now, Doctor,
you know as well as I do

256
00:23:30,152 --> 00:23:32,008
their brain system
is not developed

257
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:34,758
in either the vocal or
abstract thinking area.

258
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:37,096
Yes, sir, but I repeat
that they have the power of speech.

259
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:40,580
And it is for you gentlemen
to assess how far that power

260
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,509
can be exercised intelligently.

261
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:46,253
Well, may we be told which
is the female of the species?

262
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:53,358
Did she rise as a reflex
to you having indicated her,

263
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,316
or in answer to my question?

264
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:57,771
That's for you to decide.

265
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,707
- Have you a name?
- Zira.

266
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,632
[Crowd Gasps]

267
00:24:04,697 --> 00:24:06,553
Certainly she can articulate,

268
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:09,140
which, in itself,
is extraordinary!

269
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:12,596
Uh, but, Dr. Dixon, are we
to infer that Zira is her name

270
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,842
or some phrase
in her language?

271
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,766
Infer what you will,
Mr. Chairman.

272
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,003
I suggest you
rephrase the question.

273
00:24:22,498 --> 00:24:24,321
What is your name?

274
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,276
Zi-ra!

275
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,437
One might as well
be talking to a parrot.

276
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,675
A parrot!

277
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:39,104
Mechanical mimicry. Unique in
an ape vocally, without a doubt,

278
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,115
but, uh, does
the other one talk?

279
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:47,017
Only when she lets me.

280
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,871
[Laughs]

281
00:24:56,115 --> 00:25:00,242
- Dr. Hasslein?
- No... nothing.

282
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,093
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?

283
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,635
- What is the male's name, please?
- Cornelius.

284
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,320
- My lawfully wedded spouse.
- Wedded?

285
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:13,942
We'll take that up later,
Your Eminence.

286
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:19,701
Cornelius, do you and
your lawfully wedded spouse

287
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:21,817
speak any language
other than English?

288
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,613
What is English?

289
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:26,204
I speak the language
taught to me

290
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,693
by my father and mother,
who were taught by their

291
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:31,677
It has been the language
ofour ancestors

292
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,639
for nearly 2,000 years.

293
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:36,323
As to its origins,
who can be sure?

294
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:39,973
Gorillas and orangutans
ofour community believe

295
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,979
that God created the ape
in his own image.

296
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:46,666
Nonsense!

297
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:49,419
Cornelius, as an intellectual,
you know damned well

298
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:52,074
the gorillas are a bunch
of militaristic nincompoops.

299
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:54,154
And the orangutans are
a bunch of blinkered,

300
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:56,529
pseudoscientific geese!

301
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,228
As to humans, I've dissect--

302
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,111
I've examined thousands of them.

303
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:09,204
And until now, I've only discovered
2 who could talk in my life.

304
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:11,992
God knows who taught them.

305
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,916
Where we come from,

306
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:16,403
apes talk.

307
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:18,334
Humans are dumb.

308
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:26,271
Where do you come from,
Cornelius?

309
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,986
I'm not sure.

310
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:31,876
Dr. Milo was sure.

311
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,774
Dr. Milo was a genius
well in advance of his time.

312
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:40,138
When the spacecraft
first landed on our seaboard,

313
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:42,058
it was Dr. Milo who salvaged it.

314
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:45,474
He studied it
and half understood it.

315
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,071
Half?
Was half enough?

316
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:51,210
It was enough for us to escape
when war became inevitable.

317
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,150
Enough for Dr. Milo
to be murdered in your zoo.

318
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:56,529
Enough for my wife and I
to be here now.

319
00:26:56,595 --> 00:27:00,688
- From where, Cornelius?
- I told you, I'm not sure.

320
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:03,442
Maybe the female knows.

321
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,195
Of course the female knows!

322
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:08,305
We came from your future!

323
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:18,388
That doesn't make any sense.

324
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:20,317
It's the only thing that does.

325
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:22,937
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?

326
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,353
Cornelius, you spoke of war.

327
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:31,422
- War between whom?
- The gorillas and whoever lives--Iived.

328
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,277
- Will live.
- Who won the war?

329
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:38,784
I don't know. Chimpanzees are pacifists.
We stayed at home.

330
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:42,306
- But you left before the war had ended.
- In a spaceship.

331
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:45,194
- Which Dr. Milo learned to navigate.
- Correct.

332
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,124
Cornelius.
Did you know Colonel Taylor?

333
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:54,799
No. Is he a soldier?

334
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:59,057
We are peaceful creatures.

335
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:01,011
We are happy to be here.

336
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:03,117
May we be unchained?

337
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,961
Here they come.
Gentlemen, do you have--

338
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,886
No comment.
No comment.

339
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:25,750
- No comment.
- No comment.

340
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:28,379
- Mr. Chairman, a word.
- I'll give you one-- preposterous.

341
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,616
- Well, can you define that,
Mr. Chairman?

342
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,402
As head of this commission,
it will be our duty to sit through

343
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:37,253
the facts of this bizarre affair
and pass our conclusions

344
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:40,899
onto the president of the United States
for implementation.

345
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:45,094
- What a load of hogger mogger.
- Dr. Hasslein.

346
00:28:45,162 --> 00:28:47,334
- No comment, please.
- How will you advise the president

347
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:49,259
to handle this
unique situation?

348
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:51,399
- No comment.
- All right then, Dr. Hasslein,

349
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:53,643
could you tell us how you
personally would handle it?

350
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:57,772
No, gentlemen,
no comment... yet.

351
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,369
Doctor.

352
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:01,298
You were fabulous!

353
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:03,601
You were marvelous.
They loved you. All that applause.

354
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,774
But there was a moment--

355
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:08,367
There was when he
started to ask us--

356
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:10,480
Zira!

357
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:14,002
- Cornelius, I think we should tell them.
- No.

358
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:18,331
- But only to Lewis and Stevie.
- Oh, Zira.

359
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:21,267
I have to be honest
with someone.

360
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,099
Cornelius, please.

361
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,535
You tell them.

362
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:31,582
Well, you see...

363
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,506
we did know Colonel Taylor.

364
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,941
We came to love him.

365
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:38,876
I don't understand what harm there could
be in telling that to the commission?

366
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,530
Where we come from,

367
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,766
apes did not love humans.

368
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:49,131
They, uh, hunted them
for sport,

369
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:51,052
much as you would animals.

370
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:53,988
Yes. We use their bodies,
alive and dead,

371
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:56,933
experimentally for
anatomical dissection

372
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:59,562
and scientific research.

373
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:06,640
Well, we do the same thing
to animals.

374
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,297
I mean, as a scientist,
I sympathize,

375
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:13,170
but I agree that that's a revelation
the masses would not take kindly to.

376
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:16,554
I think you did the right thing
in denying knowledge of colonel Taylor.

377
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:20,559
- There was another reason.
- Stevie: What?

378
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:23,217
They would have asked
if he was still alive.

379
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,673
- And is he?
- Oh, no, no, no, he can't be.

380
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,569
Well, how did you know?

381
00:30:28,635 --> 00:30:31,025
Because

382
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,965
from the windows
of the spaceship...

383
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,909
we saw the Earth...

384
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,840
destroyed.

385
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:48,197
Stand by.

386
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,959
Good evening, this is Bill Bonds
reporting from Los Angeles

387
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:57,921
where the biggest story since
the moon landing broke this morning

388
00:30:57,994 --> 00:31:02,404
I repeat, talked to the
Presidential Commission of lnquiry.

389
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:05,707
With me this evening in the studio
is Dr. Otto Hasslein.

390
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:08,164
He is a senior scientific advisor
at the White House.

391
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,346
And he'll be giving us his views
on the crucial statement

392
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,272
made at this
morning's session.

393
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,885
Dr. Hasslein, as I recall,
when you asked the male ape

394
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:17,550
where he was from,

395
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:20,971
the female replied,
"From your future."

396
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,535
- Yes.
- Would you believe that?

397
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:27,024
Absolutely. I think
it is the only explanation.

398
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:29,553
Well, maybe the explanation
needs some explaining now.

399
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,700
You've written several
learned dissertations

400
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:33,747
on the nature of time.

401
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,572
Could you explain in terms that
our viewers at home will understand?

402
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:39,673
How, for instance,
a person, or persons,

403
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:43,390
could travel from
time past to time future

404
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:46,012
or, indeed, vice versa?

405
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,702
Mr. Bonds, I think that time
can only be fully understood

406
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,484
by an observer with a godlike gift
of infinite regression.

407
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,367
Could you explain
infinite regression for us?

408
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:57,538
- Roll the film.
- I'd more than happy to.

409
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,465
As a matter offact,
I came prepared to do just that.

410
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,183
Now here's a painting
of a landscape.

411
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:06,148
The artist who
painted that picture

412
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:07,914
says something is missing--
what is it?

413
00:32:07,983 --> 00:32:11,946
"It is I myself, who was part
of the landscape I painted."

414
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:16,110
So he mentally takes
a step backward, or regresses,

415
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:19,280
and paints a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the landscape.

416
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:22,580
But still something is missing-- and
that something is still his real self

417
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:24,917
painting the second picture.

418
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,832
So he regresses further
and paints a third.

419
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,265
A picture of the artist
painting a picture

420
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:33,266
of the artist painting
a picture of the landscape.

421
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,675
But because something
is still missing,

422
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:37,597
he paints
a fourth and a fifth

423
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:39,867
until he paints
a picture of the artist

424
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:43,832
painting a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the artist

425
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:46,940
painting a picture of the artist
painting a landscape.

426
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:49,117
So infinite regression then is--

427
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:52,965
It is the moment when our artist
has regressed to the point of infinity,

428
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,104
and himself, becomes part
of the landscape he painted

429
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:57,248
and is both the observer
and the observed.

430
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,907
Well, now in that
peculiar condition,

431
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:03,328
what would he be observing
if he were observing, let's say, time?

432
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:06,820
He would perceive, Mr. Bonds,
that time is like a freeway

433
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,781
with an infinite
number of lanes,

434
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:10,986
all leading from
the past into the future,

435
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,911
however, not unto the same future.

436
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:16,524
A driver in lane "A" may crash
while a driver in lane "B" survives.

437
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:20,305
It follows that a driver,
by changing lanes can change his future.

438
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:22,894
Now, Mr. Bonds, I do not
find it difficult to believe

439
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,487
that in the dark and turbulent
corridors of outer space,

440
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,238
the impact of some distant planetary,
even galactic disaster,

441
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,411
jumped the apes from
their present into ours.

442
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:34,450
Indeed, the proof lies
in their arrival among us.

443
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:36,892
And in their spoken,
and I repeat spoken testimony.

444
00:33:36,957 --> 00:33:39,063
Thank you very much,
Dr. Hasslein.

445
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:42,682
It's certainly the most incredible story
this reporter has ever covered.

446
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:45,087
I think that by their intelligence
and their good humor,

447
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,872
the 2 so-called "ape-o-nauts"
have already captured the hearts

448
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:50,241
of the entire American nation.

449
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:52,032
They will not be required

450
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,956
to appear before
the commission tomorrow.

451
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:55,778
That hearing, of course,
is going to be held in private.

452
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:59,590
They will, however, be taken
from the zoo infirmary to a hotel,

453
00:33:59,657 --> 00:34:02,593
and they will be given
an extended tour of the city.

454
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,701
This is Bill Bonds reporting
for Eyewitness News.

455
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:08,326
- Good night.
- Good night.

456
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:17,040
[Siren]

457
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,416
[Dog Barking]

458
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,186
- Your luggage, ma'am?
- Of course, it's mine!

459
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:09,834
Address, please.

460
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:16,520
- The zoo.
- [Laughs]

461
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,203
40.

462
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:10,569
May I measure
your inside leg, sir?

463
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,204
- No.
- Oh.

464
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,934
Dr. Cornelius, tell me,
how do you find our women?

465
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:26,674
Very human.

466
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,402
Very good.
Very good.

467
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,082
Excuse me.

468
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:36,492
Madam Zira, I represent Furand Feather,
a pet magazine.

469
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,639
Do you think I'm a pet?

470
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:40,622
Well, yes, I do, rather.

471
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:46,778
- Say, why don't you try some?
- What is it?

472
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:49,747
Well, it's sort of
like grape juice plus.

473
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,897
Wait! Just a sip!

474
00:37:55,968 --> 00:38:00,193
Madam Zira,
what is your favorite fruit?

475
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:02,201
Grape.

476
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,376
And that's the way
it was tonight

477
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:16,199
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

478
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:18,123
- Ha ha ha.
- Tomorrow, Zira is to speak

479
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:20,044
at the Bay Area's Women's Club.

480
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:23,788
And later, she'll accompany Dr. Hasslein
to the Museum of Natural History.

481
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:27,337
Meanwhile, Cornelius will attend
a prizefight. That's his first one.

482
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,264
Later, he'll visit Disneyland

483
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:32,113
to dedicate a new boat
for the Jungle Cruise.

484
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,034
Now, for a look
at the weather.

485
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,338
Sunny California will not
be exactly that tomorrow.

486
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:39,505
Clouds will cover the coastal area
with light showers predicted.

487
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:41,431
The downtown--

488
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,587
[Knocking]

489
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,319
- Tired?
- A little.

490
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:02,845
- How is that?
- Soothing...

491
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:05,087
but very wet.

492
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:17,311
[Applause]

493
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:25,036
A marriage bed
is made for two,

494
00:39:25,102 --> 00:39:28,650
but every damn morning
it's the woman who has to make it!

495
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,951
We have heads
as well as hands.

496
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:35,468
I call upon men
to let us use them!

497
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:41,558
[Crowd Cheering]

498
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:02,683
How do you like it,
Cornelius?

499
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:04,609
Beastly.

500
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:16,321
A giant flesh-eating dinosaur.

501
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:18,336
Now, its scientific name
is a compound

502
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,778
of the greek antron
which means "hollow"

503
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:23,211
and dimas which
means "body frame."

504
00:40:23,276 --> 00:40:25,766
Referring to
the backbone or vertebrae.

505
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,321
Now, this little fellow
is Camptosaurus Marsh,

506
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:31,848
a primitive duckbilled dinosaur.

507
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:36,363
Its scientific name is
a compound of the greek kampto,

508
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,771
which means
"flexible or bent,"

509
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,259
and sauros,
which means "Iizard."

510
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:44,751
Its generic name,
therefore, is "flexible lizard."

511
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:48,655
In 1879, O.C. Marsh
of yale University

512
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,738
described the first known species

513
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:52,852
from the Jurassic beds
of arikoma.

514
00:40:52,924 --> 00:40:55,828
Since then,
other specimens have been found--

515
00:40:58,944 --> 00:41:02,775
- It must have been the shock.
- Shock, my foot!

516
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:04,759
I'm pregnant.

517
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:13,279
I shan't leave you
until Cornelius is back.

518
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,247
- No, no, no, no!
- No, I insist. Please sit down.

519
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,427
Now, is there anything
I can get you, Zira?

520
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:23,591
Well, I have a strange craving.

521
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,766
That is only natural.

522
00:41:25,837 --> 00:41:28,326
For grape juice plus.

523
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,254
Grape juice plus?

524
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,484
It's in the--
the refrigerator.

525
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,298
All right.

526
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,943
Is this it?

527
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:58,452
Here we go.

528
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:02,584
Lewis said only a sip.

529
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:05,527
Zira, it is an excellent restorative,
I assure you.

530
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:08,090
Especially in cases of pregnancy,
you know.

531
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:12,026
- How long have you known?
- Oh, since well before the war.

532
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:18,310
Mmm.

533
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:23,238
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Uh-uh.

534
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:27,269
Oh, no, I shouldn't,
not in your condition.

535
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:30,733
Who won your war?

536
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,550
It wasn't our war.

537
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:35,984
It was the gorillas' war.

538
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:37,905
Chimpanzees are passion--

539
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,777
pacifists!

540
00:42:41,844 --> 00:42:44,301
We stayed behind.
We never saw the enemy.

541
00:42:44,374 --> 00:42:46,097
But which side won?

542
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:48,437
Neither.

543
00:42:48,503 --> 00:42:50,871
But how do you know that
if you weren't there, Zira?

544
00:42:50,937 --> 00:42:53,141
When we were in space,

545
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:58,614
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.

546
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:02,036
Then we saw the rim
of the Earth melt.

547
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:06,935
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.

548
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:08,734
Wooo.

549
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:11,389
I feel magnificently sleepy.

550
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:13,315
The date meter
on the spaceship.

551
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,895
What did it read
after Earth's destruction?

552
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:20,481
19...

553
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:23,969
73.

554
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:26,946
And before-- before
the white light and the tornado?

555
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,737
39...

556
00:43:29,805 --> 00:43:32,556
50...

557
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,664
something.

558
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:42,282
Before the white light
and the tornado?

559
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,396
Zira: 39...

560
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,030
50...

561
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:48,372
something.

562
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:50,807
- So?
- So you have evidence, Mr. President,

563
00:43:50,872 --> 00:43:52,816
that one day, talking apes
will dominate this Earth

564
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:55,346
and eventually destroy it
by 3950 something.

565
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:58,737
I doubt that we shall
still be in office by then.

566
00:43:58,813 --> 00:44:01,083
And according
to the NASA experts,

567
00:44:01,149 --> 00:44:04,729
who are still subjecting the spaceship
to microscopic scrutiny,

568
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:06,589
the precise year
of what you merely inferred

569
00:44:06,656 --> 00:44:10,007
to be Earth's destruction
is recorded on the flight synthesizer

570
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:15,104
as 3955 A.D., presumably.

571
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:18,852
Now, what do you expect me
and the United Nations--

572
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:20,992
though not necessarily
in that order--

573
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:23,268
to do about it?

574
00:44:23,336 --> 00:44:25,541
Alter what you believe to be
the course of the future

575
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:27,498
by slaughtering 2 innocents?

576
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:30,216
Or rather 3, now that
one of them is pregnant.

577
00:44:30,285 --> 00:44:33,384
Herod tried that,
and Christ survived.

578
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:35,309
Mr. President,
Herod lacked our facilities.

579
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:39,403
He also became very unpopular,
historically unpopular.

580
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:41,678
And we don't want
that to happen, do we?

581
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:46,702
I am saying that our 2 visitors seem
to be charming, peaceful people--

582
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:50,517
or rather creatures--
and that the voters love them.

583
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,885
Do you want them and their progeny
to dominate the world, Mr. President?

584
00:44:52,952 --> 00:44:56,020
Well, not at
the next election, no.

585
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,164
But, one day,
if the progeny turn out

586
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:00,625
as well as the parents,
who knows,

587
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,585
they may do a better job ofit
than we have.

588
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,951
By destroying the world?

589
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:07,257
Are you quite sure that what
they saw destroyed was the world?

590
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:11,637
- Well, aren't you?
- I consider it dispassionately

591
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,778
as a possibility,
not hysterically as a fact.

592
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:17,467
Mr. President, we have their own
testimony that they provoked the war.

593
00:45:17,538 --> 00:45:20,507
And they seemed to have provoked
you pretty thoroughly into the bargain.

594
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,363
I'm not saying that you're wrong,
Hasslein, but I am saying

595
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:26,746
that before I have them shot
against the wall, I want convincing

596
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:30,533
that the handwriting on the wall
is calculably true.

597
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,023
Now... convince me.

598
00:45:36,011 --> 00:45:38,795
By their own testimony we know
that apes one day will acquire

599
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,967
the power of
intelligent speech.

600
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,902
By Zira's testimony, we know
that she is pregnant with child.

601
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:47,344
By my own testimony we know
that it's genetically possible

602
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:50,607
for this child-- provided, of course,
always that we permit its birth--

603
00:45:50,674 --> 00:45:53,360
to bear or beget
a talking ape by a dumb one

604
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:56,496
in a present-day jungle
or a present-day zoo.

605
00:45:56,566 --> 00:46:00,113
Do you truly believe that
by deliberate present-day action

606
00:46:00,183 --> 00:46:02,039
we can neutralize
that possibility?

607
00:46:02,104 --> 00:46:05,237
- That we can alter the future?
- Yes, Mr. President, I do.

608
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,992
Do you also believe
that we should?

609
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,646
Given the power to alter the future,
have we the right to use it?

610
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,493
I don't know.

611
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,595
I've wrestled with this, Mr. President.
I just don't know.

612
00:46:17,665 --> 00:46:21,212
How many futures are there?
Which future has God, if there is a God,

613
00:46:21,283 --> 00:46:23,226
chosen for man's destiny?

614
00:46:24,356 --> 00:46:26,212
If I urged the destruction
of these 2 apes,

615
00:46:26,277 --> 00:46:28,668
am I defying God's will
or obeying it?

616
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:30,718
Am I His enemy
or His instrument?

617
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:34,242
An assassin would say the latter.

618
00:46:34,314 --> 00:46:36,681
- Do you approve of assassination?
- Well, Mr. President,

619
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:40,131
we condoned the attempted assassination
of Hitler because he was evil.

620
00:46:40,204 --> 00:46:42,060
Yes, but would we have
approved killing him

621
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,068
in babyhood when
he was still innocent?

622
00:46:44,143 --> 00:46:45,998
Or killing his mother when
he was still in her womb?

623
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:49,000
Or slaughtering
his remote ancestors?

624
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:51,529
We have no proof, Hasslein,
that these apes are evil.

625
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:53,970
- Mr. President,
there are very strong indications.

626
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:57,550
There were hesitancies
and small discrepancies in

627
00:46:57,621 --> 00:46:59,509
Which suggests to me that
if they were properly interrogated--

628
00:46:59,574 --> 00:47:02,226
Are you suggesting that they
were improperly interrogated?

629
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:04,718
- Let us say unprofessionally.
- You want it professional?

630
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,834
- The full works, Mr. President.
- Tell that to the commission.

631
00:47:08,123 --> 00:47:11,867
I'll abide by their findings.

632
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:15,829
Having convened in secret session
at the request of the president,

633
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:19,003
the commission makes
the following interim recommendations--

634
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:21,213
"1. The public
should be informed

635
00:47:21,282 --> 00:47:23,388
"that the apes, after
their arduous space voyage,

636
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:26,690
"and the fatigue arising
from its intended publicity,

637
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:29,923
"are to be afforded rest and privacy
in a location whose identity

638
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:32,228
"will not be divulged
to the public.

639
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:35,014
"2. Since, however,

640
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:37,253
"there is justifiable cause
for suspecting

641
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:40,641
"that they have withheld vital
information from this commission,

642
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:44,492
"the 'ape-o-nauts' will, in fact,
be escorted by Dr. Lewis Dixon

643
00:47:44,558 --> 00:47:47,144
"to the installation
known as Camp 11.

644
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:50,119
"Held there in his care
for interrogation by the CIA

645
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:53,773
under the guidance and supervision
of Dr. Otto Hasslein."

646
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:11,196
Zira:
When we were in space,

647
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:14,272
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.

648
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:16,200
Brighter than this?

649
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:18,274
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

650
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:24,647
Zira: Then we saw
the rim of the Earth melt.

651
00:48:24,717 --> 00:48:28,068
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.

652
00:48:28,143 --> 00:48:30,217
That's your voice, isn't it?

653
00:48:30,288 --> 00:48:32,811
How can I tell?
I don't even remember.

654
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:34,923
Why don't you remember?

655
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,096
Because Dr. Hasslein
made me drunk!

656
00:48:43,896 --> 00:48:46,515
Why did you tell something
to Dr. Hasslein when drunk

657
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:48,440
that you never told
the commission when sober?

658
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,808
Because you and your husband
were frightened

659
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:53,495
for the safety of yourselves
and your unborn child?

660
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,282
I withheld nothing.
Nobody asked me.

661
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:59,613
But if somebody had asked...

662
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,070
I should have said
that chimpanzees

663
00:49:02,146 --> 00:49:04,514
had no part in
the destruction of Earth.

664
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,784
Only the gorillas
and the orangutans.

665
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:08,827
What's the difference?
You're all monkeys.

666
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,357
Please do not use
the word monkey.

667
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,919
It is offensive to us.
As an archaeologist,

668
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:17,408
I had access to history scrolls
which were kept secret from the masses

669
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:20,297
and I suspect that the weapon
which destroyed Earth

670
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:22,272
was man's own invention.

671
00:49:22,348 --> 00:49:26,506
I do know this: one of the reasons
for man's original downfall

672
00:49:26,574 --> 00:49:29,258
was your peculiar habit
of murdering one another.

673
00:49:29,327 --> 00:49:32,591
Man destroys man.
Apes do not destroy apes.

674
00:49:32,657 --> 00:49:34,513
Cornelius.

675
00:49:35,795 --> 00:49:37,738
This is not
an interracial hassle,

676
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:39,667
but a search for facts.

677
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,996
We do not deny the possibility
of man's decline and fall.

678
00:49:43,062 --> 00:49:45,136
All we want to find out
is how apes rose.

679
00:49:49,177 --> 00:49:51,512
Well...

680
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:54,744
it began in our prehistory

681
00:49:54,813 --> 00:49:57,269
with the plague
that fell upon dogs.

682
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:01,118
- And cats.
- Hundreds and thousands of them died,

683
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:03,902
and hundreds and thousands of them
had to be destroyed

684
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:07,070
in order to prevent
the spread of infection.

685
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:10,490
- There were dog bonfires.
- Yes. And by the time

686
00:50:10,565 --> 00:50:14,560
the plague was contained,
man was without pets.

687
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:17,534
Of course, for man,
this was intolerable.

688
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:19,518
I mean, he might
kill his brother,

689
00:50:19,593 --> 00:50:21,635
but he could not kill his dog.

690
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:25,986
So humans took
primitive apes as pets.

691
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:27,720
Zira:
Primitive and dumb,

692
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,305
but still 20 times more intelligent
than dogs or cats.

693
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,516
Correct.

694
00:50:33,585 --> 00:50:35,440
They were quartered in cages,
but they lived

695
00:50:35,506 --> 00:50:37,710
and moved freely
in human homes.

696
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:40,236
They became responsive
to human speech,

697
00:50:40,308 --> 00:50:44,085
and in the course of less
than 2 centuries,

698
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,469
they progressed from
performing mere tricks

699
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,880
to performing services.

700
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:55,545
Nothing more or less than
a well-trained sheepdog could do.

701
00:50:55,612 --> 00:50:59,029
Could a sheepdog cook
or clean the house

702
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:01,721
or do the marketing for the groceries
with a list from its mistress

703
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,647
or wait on tables?

704
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:07,511
Or after 3 more centuries,
turn the tables on their owners?

705
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,474
How?

706
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:14,561
They became alert to
the concept of slavery,

707
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:17,861
and, as their numbers grew,
to slavery 's antidote,

708
00:51:17,928 --> 00:51:20,067
which, of course, is unity.

709
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:23,237
Well, at first,
they began assembling in small groups.

710
00:51:23,306 --> 00:51:27,465
They learned the art of corporate
and militant action.

711
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:30,382
They learned to refuse.

712
00:51:30,446 --> 00:51:34,703
At first, they just
grunted their refusal.

713
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:37,104
But then,
on an historic day

714
00:51:37,169 --> 00:51:39,025
which is commemorated
by my species

715
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,874
and fully documented
in the sacred scrolls,

716
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,796
there came Aldo.

717
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:46,284
He did not grunt.

718
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:48,596
He articulated.

719
00:51:48,664 --> 00:51:52,113
He spoke a word which
had been spoken to him

720
00:51:52,185 --> 00:51:55,634
over time without number
by humans.

721
00:51:55,706 --> 00:51:58,556
He said...

722
00:51:58,621 --> 00:52:00,662
"No."

723
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:10,395
So that's how
it all started.

724
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:14,010
Clip one, please.

725
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:19,103
Cornelius:
Where we come from, apes talk.

726
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:21,031
Humans are dumb.

727
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,781
You recognize your husband's words
to the commission?

728
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,706
Yes.

729
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:28,707
So humans were dumb.
Were they happy?

730
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,636
Clip two.

731
00:52:30,701 --> 00:52:33,485
Zira:
As to humans, I've dissect--

732
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:36,170
I've examined thousands of them.

733
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,248
And until now,
I've only discovered

734
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,176
2 who could talk in my life.

735
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,626
Why did you change words
in the middle of a sentence?

736
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,588
Repeat first three seconds
of clip two.

737
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:51,791
Zira: As to humans,
I've dissect-- I've examined--

738
00:52:51,864 --> 00:52:55,029
- What was the word you didn't finish?
- I can't remember.

739
00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:57,848
- Play the loop.
- Zira: Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

740
00:52:57,916 --> 00:53:00,055
- Complete the word, monkey.
- Look, I have told you--

741
00:53:00,124 --> 00:53:02,329
- Complete the word!
- Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

742
00:53:02,397 --> 00:53:04,154
Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

743
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,558
Sounds as if I had hiccups!

744
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,753
[Laughing]

745
00:53:11,074 --> 00:53:12,929
Call for Dr. Dixon, please.

746
00:53:14,116 --> 00:53:18,046
Dr. Dixon?
Dr. Hasslein calling Dr. Dixon.

747
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,016
P.A.:
Calling Dr. Dixon.

748
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:32,135
Ah, Dr. Dixon. Come in.

749
00:53:40,082 --> 00:53:43,597
- Be good enough to administer
this to the female.

750
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,741
Sodium Pentothal.
1/2 gram l.V.

751
00:53:45,812 --> 00:53:49,294
- Dr. Hasslein,
I'm an animal psychiatrist.

752
00:53:49,366 --> 00:53:51,855
You have
the commission's authority.

753
00:53:51,927 --> 00:53:54,995
And that of the president.
Please.

754
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:02,646
Zira, I've been asked
to give you an injection--

755
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:05,915
You can't use that! We only
use those things for killing.

756
00:54:05,982 --> 00:54:09,017
- Killing?
- No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.

757
00:54:09,088 --> 00:54:11,097
This is for relaxing.
It won't harm her.

758
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,953
- Will it harm my baby?
- No, it won't.

759
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,408
So, Zira, if you would
just come with me, please.

760
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:18,874
Lewis, you can't
use that on Zira!

761
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:22,268
- Please, take him to his quarters!
- Really.

762
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:24,549
No, you mustn't!

763
00:54:25,864 --> 00:54:27,808
Zira! Zira!

764
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,060
Please.

765
00:54:39,664 --> 00:54:41,552
Just lie down on the couch.

766
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:48,173
And bare your arm, please.

767
00:54:48,245 --> 00:54:50,547
You don't have to tell me!

768
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,514
This has the same effect
as grape juice plus.

769
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,502
Now count backward from 10.

770
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:19,875
10... 9...

771
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,829
8... 7...

772
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:24,710
6... 5.

773
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:28,323
4.

774
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:32,035
What comes after 4?

775
00:55:32,106 --> 00:55:33,668
2.

776
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,594
- Thank you, Dr. Dixon.
- It's customary to stay.

777
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:51,605
- Zira.
- Hmm.

778
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:54,540
You worked
in a room like this.

779
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:56,404
Hmm...

780
00:55:57,433 --> 00:56:01,329
Bigger. Not so pretty.

781
00:56:01,402 --> 00:56:05,048
And there you practiced--

782
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:07,901
Comparative.

783
00:56:07,966 --> 00:56:10,422
Comparative what?

784
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,213
- An--an--an--
- Anatomy?

785
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:17,058
- Anata--
- Whose anatomies did you compare?

786
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,978
Apes and humans?

787
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:25,122
Zira, say yes
if you mean yes.

788
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:29,693
- Yes.
- So you dissected other apes?

789
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:31,554
Ye--yes...

790
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:35,398
when they died
a natural death.

791
00:56:35,464 --> 00:56:38,280
And humans, too, of course.

792
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:40,102
Yes...

793
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,401
as they were made available.

794
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:48,425
- Available?
- Gorillas hunted them for sport

795
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:51,114
in nets and with guns.

796
00:56:51,184 --> 00:56:54,219
The survivors were put in cages.

797
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:58,033
The army used some
for target practice.

798
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,068
We could pick from the rest.

799
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:05,037
In the interest of science,
you dissected, removed,

800
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:06,835
and statistically compared...

801
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:10,933
bones, muscles, tendons,
veins, arteries,

802
00:57:11,003 --> 00:57:13,589
kidneys, livers, hearts,

803
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:15,515
stomachs, reproductive organs,

804
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,436
nails, tongues, eyes,

805
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:20,602
noses, nervous systems,

806
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:22,876
the various reflexes.

807
00:57:22,945 --> 00:57:24,734
Reflexes?

808
00:57:24,801 --> 00:57:26,657
Of the dead?

809
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:30,619
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Of the living.

810
00:57:30,692 --> 00:57:33,858
You can't make
a dead man's knee jump

811
00:57:33,926 --> 00:57:38,751
any more than you can test
a corpse's reaction to a lobotomy.

812
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:40,681
You were advanced enough

813
00:57:40,746 --> 00:57:44,523
to perform experimental
brain surgery on living humans?

814
00:57:44,588 --> 00:57:48,551
Oh, yes.
We even tried to stimulate

815
00:57:48,622 --> 00:57:51,439
their atrophied speech centers.

816
00:57:51,504 --> 00:57:53,479
Did you try to stimulate

817
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:55,408
Colonel Taylor's speech centers?

818
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:59,120
Of course not.
He could talk already.

819
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:02,287
When you left,
was Colonel Taylor alive?

820
00:58:02,356 --> 00:58:05,293
We loved Taylor.

821
00:58:05,366 --> 00:58:09,197
We did all we could
to help him--

822
00:58:09,272 --> 00:58:11,280
Cornelius and l.

823
00:58:13,915 --> 00:58:15,770
Cornelius!

824
00:58:15,836 --> 00:58:17,691
She needs a nap.

825
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:19,765
She'll get it.

826
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,495
Orderly.

827
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:30,819
- Sir?
- Take the female ape to its quarters.

828
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:34,498
We must get this
to the commission.

829
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,802
- [Bangs Gavel]
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

830
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:40,168
I've received an off cial notification
from the president

831
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:43,048
ratifying the final recommendations
made by this commission

832
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:45,450
in light of
the tape recordings

833
00:58:45,515 --> 00:58:47,753
delivered by Dr. Hasslein.

834
00:58:47,821 --> 00:58:51,532
If you'll be seated,
we'll get down to business.

835
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:54,896
Now, let me review
our conclusions.

836
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,816
"1. By a majority vote,

837
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:59,696
"the commission finds
no solid evidence for hostility

838
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:02,578
"by either ape
towards the human race

839
00:59:02,644 --> 00:59:05,941
as it is presently constituted
in this year, 1973."

840
00:59:06,006 --> 00:59:08,822
- I disagree--
- Let me remind you

841
00:59:08,887 --> 00:59:12,184
that this was
by a majority vote.

842
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,104
"The male's attitude is that

843
00:59:14,169 --> 00:59:16,025
"of a deeply interested academician

844
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,867
"who studied the alleged future
downfall of the human race

845
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:22,782
"with the true objectivity
of a good historian.

846
00:59:22,847 --> 00:59:24,702
"The female's case is different,

847
00:59:24,768 --> 00:59:27,103
"in that she undoubtedly committed

848
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:29,024
"actions against the human race

849
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:31,873
"of a sort which,
if committed today,

850
00:59:31,939 --> 00:59:33,795
"would be called atrocities,

851
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,637
"but would they be so called
in 2,000 years' time,

852
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:40,038
"when it is alleged that humans

853
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:41,959
"will have become dumb brutes

854
00:59:42,024 --> 00:59:43,879
"with the intelligence of animals?

855
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:47,721
"It's been noted that
what apes will do to humans

856
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:50,920
"is no more than what humans
now do to beasts.

857
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:53,609
"Nonetheless,
the commission is sympathetic

858
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,259
"to Dr. Hasslein's conviction
that these apes' progeny

859
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:59,185
"could, in centuries to come,

860
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,066
"prove an increasing threat
to the human race

861
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,466
"and conceivably end
by dominating it.

01:00:07,413 --> 01:00:09,749
"Therefore...

864

"that the birth

873
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:34,723
They are savages!

into my pregnant wife.

01:00:37,669 --> 01:00:39,525
I've done that too, dear,

876
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,926
and worse.

877
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:46,249
Taylor thought
we were savages at first.

878
01:00:47,754 --> 01:00:50,985
Did they make you tell them
about Taylor too?

879
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:55,844
They made me tell them
everything, Cornelius.

880
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:59,979
- Brutes.
- Shall I tell you something?

881
01:01:00,048 --> 01:01:04,110
I'm glad I did.
We can't live with lies.

882
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:08,174
After this, I doubt
we shall be allowed to live at all.

883
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:13,046
Do you mean that?

884
01:01:13,112 --> 01:01:14,967
Ohh...

885
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:19,290
How long?

886
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:21,428
A week.

887
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,606
Maybe sooner.

888
01:01:23,677 --> 01:01:27,869

01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:33,789
Chow time.

01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:35,714
I'm not hungry.

892
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:40,254
Well, maybe somebody else is
who can't talk yet.

893
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:43,142
Oh, come on, ma'am.
It's pure vitamin C.

894
01:01:43,207 --> 01:01:45,063
You better drink the soup
and eat the oranges

- Grr!

What have you done,
Cornelius?

897
01:01:50,316 --> 01:01:53,131
Nobody makes a fool
out of my wife.

898
01:01:53,197 --> 01:01:55,052
We just ought to leave.

899
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:22,266
I'll be going back
with Dr. Hasslein soon.

900
01:02:22,331 --> 01:02:24,437
I have to tell them.

901
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:28,122
- You've got to come help me.
- I'll come right away.

902
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:32,218
Itjust seems so cruel
and horrible and-- I don't know.

903
01:02:32,288 --> 01:02:34,198
I'll see you.

904
01:02:36,194 --> 01:02:39,491
- Cruel, Dr. Dixon?
- Unbelievably.

905
01:02:39,557 --> 01:02:41,565
Zira wants her baby.

906
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:44,192
- So do l.
- But dead.

907
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:48,488
- Yes.
- You'd prefer the parents dead too.

908
01:02:48,553 --> 01:02:50,594

I'll take a look.

911
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,500
No, sir. The lieutenant
hasn't checked in yet.

912
01:03:21,946 --> 01:03:24,698
- Good night, Charlie.
- Night, Ed.

913
01:03:24,764 --> 01:03:27,580
Yes, sir.
I'll give him that message.

914
01:03:27,645 --> 01:03:30,778
"Contact the motor pool."
As soon as I see him.

due until 0600 hours.

- Well, I'm sorry, sir.
- Good night, Charlie.

920
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:48,643
I said, "good night."

921
01:03:48,713 --> 01:03:51,103
We can't contact them
until then.

922
01:03:51,178 --> 01:03:53,350
Well, the depot's closed, sir.

923
01:03:53,419 --> 01:03:55,591
Okay, sir.
I'll be off duty,

comes on at 0430 hours.

01:03:58,445 --> 01:04:02,037
I'll have him pass
the message. Yes, sir.

926
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:22,046
Zira, what's the matter?

927
01:04:24,033 --> 01:04:25,888
I...

928
01:04:25,954 --> 01:04:28,769
I think my pains have begun.

929
01:04:28,835 --> 01:04:30,690
Oh, my dear.

930
01:04:45,004 --> 01:04:47,460
Administration, Doctor.
It's urgent.

931
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,546
- What happened?
- The apes killed their orderly.

932
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:22,070
- Where are they?
- On the run.

933
01:05:22,143 --> 01:05:25,145
Now they've killed.
For that, they must be killed.

934
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:27,934
It has to be done
before we start a stone rolling

935
01:05:28,002 --> 01:05:32,160
that'll gather enough
poison moss to kill us all!

936
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:48,129
Look.
I'll go back to camp.

937
01:05:48,204 --> 01:05:52,199
- I'll find Lewis and get help.
- No. No.

938
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:54,890
I just lost my temper
with the boy.

939
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,824
- It's better now. I can walk.
- Listen to me.

940
01:05:58,898 --> 01:06:00,972
They may punish us
for what we did,

941
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:03,760
but at least the baby
will be born.

942
01:06:38,022 --> 01:06:41,188
- Were they armed?
- No, I don't believe so.

943
01:06:41,256 --> 01:06:45,033
Then there's no need
for a shooting match.

944
01:06:45,098 --> 01:06:46,954
Not strictly speaking.

945
01:06:47,019 --> 01:06:48,875
I am speaking strictly,
Hasslein.

946
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,079
Science regards
these apes as unique.

947
01:06:51,149 --> 01:06:53,571
People regard them
as practically human.

948
01:06:53,646 --> 01:06:55,982
The killers of today
could become

949
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:58,056
the mass murderers of tomorrow.

950
01:06:58,128 --> 01:07:01,426
I can think of no one
better equipped emotionally

951
01:07:01,491 --> 01:07:04,307
to persuade the people
of that possibility,

952
01:07:04,372 --> 01:07:07,188
but, in a democracy,
we do not shoot

953
01:07:07,254 --> 01:07:10,069
unarmed suspects on sight
for a murder

954
01:07:10,135 --> 01:07:12,951
in which their participation
is still legally unproven.

955
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:16,367
I want them taken, yes,
but taken alive.

956
01:07:16,442 --> 01:07:18,232
Is that clear?

957
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:20,307
Quite clear, Mr. President.

958
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:51,787
You lost, miss?

959
01:07:51,852 --> 01:07:53,708
Oh, it's you, Dr. Branton.

960
01:07:53,773 --> 01:07:56,043
Be careful.
There's been a murder.

961
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:00,073
- Murder?
- The monkeys have killed

962
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:03,441
What? I don't believe it.
How did it happen?

963
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,323
All I know is they've
killed their orderly,

964
01:08:06,388 --> 01:08:10,481
And I've been given orders
to find them. Drive carefully.

965
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:13,814
There will be a lot
of vehicles in the area.

966
01:08:37,124 --> 01:08:38,979
Cornelius, what have you done?

967
01:08:39,044 --> 01:08:41,381
I didn't mean to kill him.

968
01:08:41,446 --> 01:08:43,781
He was teasing Zira.
I hit him with a tray.

969
01:08:43,847 --> 01:08:47,330
- Please believe me.
- I do, Cornelius, but they won't.

970
01:08:47,402 --> 01:08:51,876
- Where's Zira?
- She's back there.

971
01:08:51,947 --> 01:08:54,121
Stevie... she's in labor.

972
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:57,735
Oh, God. Get in.

973
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:07,731
Stevie, you won't
take us back to the camp?

974
01:09:07,796 --> 01:09:11,093
Get down.
I have a better idea.

975
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:29,404
Now, wait a second.
Just a moment.

976
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,327
Let me get this straight.

977
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:34,208
You are asking me
to risk imprisonment

978
01:09:34,273 --> 01:09:37,024
for the sake of two
fugitive apes?

979
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:40,389
The answer is
a thousand times... yes.

980
01:09:40,453 --> 01:09:43,269
Oh, yes.
I do it for you

981
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:45,190
and for Stevie

982
01:09:45,255 --> 01:09:47,590
and for your two
distinguished friends.

983
01:09:47,656 --> 01:09:50,953
- Uh, notorious now.
- The hell with notoriety.

984
01:09:51,018 --> 01:09:53,834
What is a husband
expected to do?

985
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,715
Stand by and see
his wife insulted?

986
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,597
Aren't we rude
enough to each other

987
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,478
without having to be
rude to animals?

988
01:10:02,543 --> 01:10:05,360
Anyway, he didn't mean
to kill the boy.

989
01:10:05,425 --> 01:10:07,368
Los trato bien, muchachos?

990
01:10:07,442 --> 01:10:10,095
Si, patron. Salud!

991
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,499
I sure appreciate
what you're doing.

992
01:10:12,565 --> 01:10:14,901
You helped deliver
our last baby.

993
01:10:14,966 --> 01:10:17,301
Now you will deliver our next.

994
01:10:23,195 --> 01:10:26,492
Lewis!
What took you so long?

995
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,241
I had to make some excuse.
They think I'm searching.

996
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:33,535
- Armando's been a saint.
- Saint Francis would have

997
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,563
- Never.
- Say hello to Heloise

998
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:40,221
and your goddaughter Salome.

999
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:44,483
- Hello, Salome.
- The first chimp ever born in a circus.

Los Angeles has had four.

1001
01:10:46,374 --> 01:10:49,442
Los Angeles isn't a circus.
It's a zoo.

1002
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:51,368
So New Yorkers say.

1003
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:53,442
Lewis is here.

1004
01:10:53,514 --> 01:10:56,331
Lewis, I was not responsible
for the death--

1005
01:10:56,396 --> 01:11:01,614
I know, but you will be responsible
for a birth. How is she?

1006
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:03,916
The pains are coming
every five minutes.

1007
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:06,374
Every four.

1008
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:08,555
[Chattering]

1009
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:12,905
- Look. Look at Heloise.
- [Baby Chattering]

1010
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:15,699
She's showing an expectant mother
what to expect.

1011
01:11:15,766 --> 01:11:18,156
Mama. Mama.

1012
01:11:18,231 --> 01:11:21,048
Say it. Mama.

1013
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:23,056
- Mama.
- Zira.

1014
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:24,985
Zira, don't waste your breath.

1015
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:27,867
You know the child
of two primitive apes

1016
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:30,748
will never learn how to speak.

1017
01:11:30,814 --> 01:11:32,669
I'm getting into practice.

1018
01:11:32,734 --> 01:11:35,551

1019
01:11:35,616 --> 01:11:38,655

[Moaning]

1020
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:47,427
There. That's good.

1021
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:51,748
Come on. Over here.

1022
01:11:59,498 --> 01:12:01,834
What are we going to call...

1023
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,235
- Him.
- him?

1024
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,156
Milo?

1025
01:12:09,103 --> 01:12:10,959
Milo.

1026
01:12:11,984 --> 01:12:13,840
Milo.

1027
01:12:18,228 --> 01:12:21,044
- Milo.
- Congratulations.

1028
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:22,965
Oh.

1030
01:12:26,872 --> 01:12:29,111
- No?
- No.

1031
01:12:48,516 --> 01:12:51,813
- But, sir--
- Captain, I'm aware

1032
01:12:51,877 --> 01:12:53,733
the areas we first established.

1033
01:12:53,798 --> 01:12:57,096
Evidently, we were wrong
because you haven't found them!

1034
01:12:57,161 --> 01:13:00,129
Thank you.
Dr. Dixon, can you pinpoint

1035
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:03,399
the probable date of the baby's birth
with any degree of accuracy?

1036
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:06,982
Well, I never examined her,
but from appearances

1037
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:09,159
I'd say a week to 10 days.

1038
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,883
If that's close,
she can't have gone far.

1039
01:13:11,952 --> 01:13:13,895
- Where do apes go?
- To other apes.

1040
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:22,035
Of course. Captain, I want you
to start an immediate search

1041
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:24,688
of every menagerie,
zoo, and circus.

1042
01:13:24,759 --> 01:13:26,767
I'll augment your force
with the city police,

1043
01:13:26,839 --> 01:13:30,965
and I want to be kept informed
about all results.

1044
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:34,199
- Yes, sir.
- [Door Closes]

1045
01:13:37,598 --> 01:13:40,152
- Lewis will think of something.
- I am so sorry.

1046
01:13:40,223 --> 01:13:42,012
I had planned it so well.

1047
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,911
In one month, we move on
to our winter quarters in Florida.

1048
01:13:45,986 --> 01:13:48,857
I could have released you
in the Everglades.

1049
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:52,675
You might have lived
happily ever after.

1050
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:55,076
But now...
what can I do?

1051
01:13:55,142 --> 01:13:58,440
You have done enough
to make us grateful forever.

1052
01:13:58,504 --> 01:14:02,761
I did it because
I like chimpanzees best of all apes,

1053
01:14:02,826 --> 01:14:06,025
and you,
the best of all chimpanzees.

1054
01:14:07,532 --> 01:14:11,331
I did it because I hate those
who try to alter destiny

1055
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:14,342
which is the unalterable
will of God.

1056
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,272
Ifit is man's destiny

1057
01:14:16,337 --> 01:14:18,193
one day to be dominated,

1058
01:14:18,258 --> 01:14:20,528
Iet him be dominated by you.

1059
01:14:22,356 --> 01:14:25,456
All I can now do
to help you

1060
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:29,303
is give you this
for the baby.

1061
01:14:29,369 --> 01:14:32,982
It's a medal of
Saint Francis of assisi.

1062
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:36,183
- Who is he?
- He was a holy man

1063
01:14:36,251 --> 01:14:38,587
who loved and cared for animals.

1064
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:40,988
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

1065
01:14:41,054 --> 01:14:43,705
We'll hang it around
the baby's neck

1066
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:45,631
for protection, huh?

1067
01:14:45,696 --> 01:14:48,546
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1068
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,945
And now, my dear,
dear friends,

1069
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,787
before the police come
and the audience gathers,

1070
01:14:54,852 --> 01:14:57,156
you and your pretty baby must go.

1071
01:14:57,223 --> 01:14:59,079
Lewis is on his way.

1072
01:14:59,144 --> 01:15:01,796
- Armando.
- Yes?

1073
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:05,479
I should like to say good-bye
to Heloise first.

1074
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:08,712
Ifshe could speak,
she'd say she's sorry.

1075
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:12,394
I know, but we
understand each other.

1076
01:15:15,407 --> 01:15:17,263
All right.
All right.

1077
01:16:15,023 --> 01:16:18,253
This is as far
as we dare to take you.

1078
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,670
The police have roadblocks
on every main exit.

1079
01:16:21,746 --> 01:16:23,918
- Here are your supplies.
- Thank you.

1080
01:16:23,988 --> 01:16:25,876
Can you read a map?

1081
01:16:25,941 --> 01:16:29,237
I'm an archaeologist.
I can even draw one.

1082
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:33,078
We're at the city limits

1083
01:16:33,143 --> 01:16:35,960
at the southern edge
of this oil field.

1084
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:38,361
Over this hill,
you'll pass through

1085
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,763
more oil wells,
an abandoned refinery,

1086
01:16:40,828 --> 01:16:43,644
and you'll be looking
down at a harbor.

1087
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:46,045
It's a graveyard
for old ships.

1088
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:48,447
I played there as a kid.

1089
01:16:48,512 --> 01:16:51,328
There's a derelict tanker
at one end.

1090
01:16:51,393 --> 01:16:53,533
- You can hide there for a week.
- A week?

1091
01:16:53,603 --> 01:16:57,729
Until the commotion dies down and
we can smuggle you back to the circus.

1092
01:16:57,797 --> 01:17:00,995
Then you can travel
with them to Florida,

1093
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:04,512

and live happily ever after.

1096
01:17:08,683 --> 01:17:10,538

1097
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:16,717
It's time that
you were moving on.

1098
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:22,032
- Lewis.
- Yes?

1099
01:17:22,098 --> 01:17:26,923
If they find us,
we shall be killed?

1100
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:31,603
Ultimately.

1101
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:35,982
Then, uh... give us
the opportunity

1102
01:17:36,057 --> 01:17:37,912
to kill ourselves

1103
01:17:37,978 --> 01:17:40,914
if that moment should come.

1104
01:17:43,228 --> 01:17:45,652
Please.

1105
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:50,495
I shouldn't do this,

1106
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,432
but I guessed you might ask.

1107
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:03,202
You're the second human
I've kissed.

1108
01:18:08,714 --> 01:18:11,531
And you are the first.

1109

Come along, Zira.
Now, don't dawdle.

The ape with the kid?

1111
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:06,278
She's been with
the circus seven years now.

1112
01:19:06,344 --> 01:19:09,160
The baby's birth was
registered 16 days ago.

1113
01:19:09,225 --> 01:19:11,081
Look how he's growing.

1114
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:15,207
The first chimpanzee
ever to be born in a circus!

1115
01:19:15,276 --> 01:19:18,093
Do you realize what
a distinction that is?

1116
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,651
It's like being
the first fish born on land.

1117
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:25,873
- Nothing.
- It's like being the first bird

on the moon.

1119

sooner or later.

Later we'll do something
about pollution.

Later we'll do something
about the population explosion.

about nuclear war.

has the world got?

begin to care.

- She didn't need this anymore.
- Why don't we get moving?

- How long till they get here?

- Yes, sir.

1147
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:14,726
It was probably cleaner then.

wanted oil for--
