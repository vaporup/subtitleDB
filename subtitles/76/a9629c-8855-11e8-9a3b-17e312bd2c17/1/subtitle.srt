1
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:00,962
Good morning...

2
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:06,384
I’m Dr. Jung.

3
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:08,887
I admitted you yesterday.

4
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,183
I’m not...

5
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,645
I’m not mad, you know.

6
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:22,275
Let me explain what I have in mind.

7
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:28,698
I propose that we meet here, most
days, to talk for an hour or two.

8
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,617
Talk?

9
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,035
Yes.

10
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:33,203
Just talk.

11
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,540
See if we can identify
what’s troubling you.

12
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:42,462
So as to distract you as little as possible,
I’m going to sit there, behind you.

13
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:47,300
I’m going to ask you to try not to turn around
and look at me under any circumstances.

14
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,347
Now...

15
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:09,823
Have you any idea what may have brought
on these attacks you suffer from?

16
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,033
Hu...

17
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,998
humiliation.

18
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,129
Any kind of...

19
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,258
humiliation.

20
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,305
Like, I can’t bear to see it and
it makes me feel nauseated.

21
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:38,101
I start pouring with sweat, cold sweat.

22
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:40,310
My...

23
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:40,896
my...

24
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:52,407
my father lost his temper all the time.
He was always angry with me.

25
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:02,542
When you stopped talking just now,
did a thought come into your head?

26
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,545
I...

27
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,880
I don’t know...

28
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:09,090
Or an image, perhaps.

29
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,051
Was it an image?

30
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,344
Yes.

31
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,013
What was the image?

32
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,351
It was a hand.

33
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:19,935
My...

34
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:20,435
my...

35
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:24,022
my father’s hand.

36
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,815
Why do you think you saw that?

37
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:31,029
Whenever he would...

38
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:34,699
after...

39
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,534
whenever he...

40
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,332
he hit us, afterward we...

41
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:45,877
we had to kiss his hand.

42
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:55,679
What’s odd is that case I was writing up last
week, I happened to pick the codename Sabina S.

43
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,931
And here she is... Sabina Spielrein.

44
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,725
Quite a coincidence.

45
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:04,145
As you know, I don’t believe
there is such a thing.

46
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,775
Spielrein’s not a very Russian name.

47
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,194
No, Jewish.

48
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:14,948
Father’s a very successful
import-export man.

49
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,910
And she’s exceptionally well
educated, speaks fluent German.

50
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,788
Aspires to be a doctor herself, apparently.

51
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:23,832
Perhaps she’s the one.

52
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,042
What one?

53
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,793
The one you’ve been looking for.

54
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,838
For your experimental treatment.

55
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,173
The talking cure.

56
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,885
You’re so astute.

57
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:37,804
I’ve already begun it with her.

58
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:40,557
He’s kicking.

59
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,100
Can you feel?

60
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:45,687
Oh, yes.

61
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,063
There he is.

62
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:53,268
What I don’t understand is
why Freud, having proposed

63
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,827
this radical therapeutic idea,
this talking cure, this

64
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:00,257
psychoanalysis, then lets
years go by without giving

65
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:03,622
even the barest outline of
his clinical procedures?

66
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,956
What’s he playing at?

67
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,667
Presumably he uses the
method on his patients?

68
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,419
I’ve no idea.

69
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,964
So might you be the first
doctor to try this out?

70
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,049
It’s possible.

71
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,676
Why don’t you write and ask him?

72
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:18,512
I don’t know him.

73
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:25,352
As it happens, Miss Spielrein’s mother
wanted to take her to see Freud.

74
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:29,064
Another coincidence.

75
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:34,194
My father thinks my
mother doesn’t love him.

76
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,655
And he’s right, she doesn’t.

77
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:38,490
How do you know?

78
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,160
My angel told me.

79
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:44,579
What angel?

80
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:47,958
An inner voice.

81
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:51,461
He used to tell me I was
an exceptional person.

82
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:53,922
For some reason he always spoke in German.

83
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:57,676
Angels always speak German
... It’s traditional.

84
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:02,430
He gave me the power to know what people are
going to say before they open their mouths.

85
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:05,308
Useful ability for a doctor.

86
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,520
You hope to be a doctor
some day, don’t you?

87
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,690
I’ll never be a doctor.

88
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,983
Why not?

89
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:25,620
I have to go away for awhile.

90
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:27,497
I’m sorry.

91
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,540
We’ve just gotten started.

92
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,792
Military service.

93
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,251
We all have to do it.

94
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,004
Just for a couple of weeks.

95
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:34,713
It’s a waste of time!

96
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,258
I can’t tell you whatever
it is you want to know!

97
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,009
You’re just...

98
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,010
you’re just making me angry.

99
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:41,928
And even if I could tell you,
you’d be sorry you ever...!

100
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,683
Anyway, there’s nothing wrong with me!

101
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:47,893
I don’t even want to get better!

102
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,063
Stop it!

103
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:54,065
What?

104
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,276
Will you just stop that!

105
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,363
I’m sorry.

106
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,077
Can we get back now?

107
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,537
Yes, if you want to.

108
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,622
I need to get back.

109
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,876
It’s a complete waste of my time.

110
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:20,592
Writing prescriptions for athlete’s foot and
examining cocks from morning ‘til night.

111
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,053
Is that what you do?

112
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,222
It’s not good for me.

113
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:27,224
It’s not good for my patients.

114
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,578
You’re playing with your food.

115
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:50,455
I'm not hungry.

116
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,916
Is that so?

117
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,797
I shall have to tell Professor Bleuler.

118
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,173
Ha.

119
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,176
Do what you like.

120
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,865
Please, Miss, give me your hand.

121
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:26,741
Please.

122
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,578
You’ll catch your death.

123
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,162
Miss Spielrein.

124
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,543
The Herr Direktor.

125
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,131
Blueleri feel you may have a little
too much time on your hands.

126
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:45,010
I’m a great believer in getting our
patients involved in some productive work.

127
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,053
What are your particular interests?

128
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,015
Suicide.

129
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,559
Interplanetary travel.

130
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,769
When Dr.

131
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:58,398
Jung returns, I shall ask him to discuss
all this with you in more detail.

132
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,776
You keep him away from me.

133
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:02,820
I never want to see him again!

134
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:13,956
Now, come along.

135
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,165
Don’t make such a fuss.

136
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,460
Give me those legs.

137
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,345
Here’s the sponge?

138
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:30,014
Just lie still.

139
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:32,391
That’s better.

140
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:37,855
Hello?

141
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,483
I’m back.

142
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,569
How have you been?

143
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:50,409
I’ve been talking to the Herr Direktor
about finding some work for you.

144
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:53,662
I told him you’d always been
interested in medicine.

145
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:58,042
So he suggested you might like to
assist me occasionally in my research.

146
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,966
We’re quite short-staffed so it
would certainly be a help to me.

147
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:04,692
Vienna.

148
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:06,318
Woods.

149
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:08,653
Box.

150
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,113
Bed.

151
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:12,449
Money.

152
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:13,742
Bank.

153
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,038
Child.

154
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,748
Soon.

155
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:22,835
Family.

156
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,341
Unit.

157
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,011
Sex.

158
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,137
Uh...

159
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:35,931
male.

160
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,516
Wall.

161
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:39,351
Flower.

162
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:44,189
Young.

163
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:49,945
Baby.

164
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:53,032
Ask.

165
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,450
Answer.

166
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,617
Cap.

167
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:56,493
Wear.

168
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:57,453
Stubborn.

169
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:59,204
Give way.

170
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:04,960
Ruefulness.

171
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,384
Child.

172
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,681
Fame.

173
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:18,766
Doctor.

174
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,688
Divorce.

175
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:30,944
No.

176
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:35,199
Thank you.

177
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:40,287
Is that all?

178
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,497
That’s all.

179
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,249
How did I do?

180
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,542
Beautifully.

181
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:54,134
Good bye.

182
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:56,762
Yes, good bye.

183
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,233
Any preliminary observations?

184
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,948
Obviously, what’s uppermost
in her mind is her pregnancy.

185
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,118
Good.

186
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:22,287
And she’s a little...

187
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:25,165
what’s the word?

188
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:31,255
Why don’t we try a useful word invented
“ambivalent.

189
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:36,218
Yes, about the baby.

190
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,261
Anything else?

191
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:42,599
I’d say she was worried her husband
might be losing interest in her.

192
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:47,604
What makes you think that?

193
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:52,401
Long reaction times to the
words “family” and “divorce”.

194
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:54,361
I see.

195
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:57,406
And when you said “cap, ” she said “wear”.

196
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:00,075
Might that be a reference to contraception?

197
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,079
You have quite a flair for this.

198
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,374
Can I ask you something?

199
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,209
Of course.

200
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,629
Is she your wife?

201
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:26,393
I’m sorry.

202
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,730
Sorry?

203
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:33,817
I promised you a son on Christmas Day.

204
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,278
And here she is a day
late and the wrong sex.

205
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:44,953
Don’t be absurd.

206
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,261
‘A’ for Agathe.

207
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:05,599
Next time I’ll give you a boy.

208
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,688
Can you explain why your
nights have been so bad?

209
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:18,278
I’m afraid.

210
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,321
Of what?

211
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:24,702
There’s something in the room.

212
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:25,452
Something like...

213
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:30,039
like a cat, only it can speak.

214
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,166
It gets into bed with me.

215
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,171
Last...

216
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,345
last night, it suddenly
whispered something in my ear.

217
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,304
I couldn’t hear what.

218
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:47,766
But then...

219
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:04,116
I felt it against my back.

220
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:09,705
Something slimy like...

221
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:20,466
like some kind of a mollusc,
moving against my back.

222
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,220
But when I...

223
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:28,599
when I turned around,
there was nothing there.

224
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:33,687
You felt it against your back?

225
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:36,231
Yes.

226
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,400
Were you naked?

227
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:42,404
I was.

228
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,823
Were you masturbating?

229
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,120
Yes.

230
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,252
Tell me about the first time you can
remember being beaten by your father.

231
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,635
I suppose I was about four.

232
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,016
I’d broken a plate or...

233
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:14,478
oh, yes, and...

234
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:24,905
and he told me to go into the little
room and take my clothes off.

235
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:25,489
And then...

236
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:37,334
he came in... and spanked me.

237
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:37,960
And then...

238
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:45,843
I was so frightened that I
wet myself and then he...

239
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,304
he hit me again.

240
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:52,891
And then I...

241
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:59,481
That first time, how did you
feel about what was happening?

242
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,531
<whispering> I liked it.

243
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,367
Would you repeat that, please?

244
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:11,744
I couldn’t quite hear.

245
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:16,165
I liked it.

246
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:21,962
It excited me.

247
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:27,134
And did you continue to like it?

248
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:31,847
<crying> Yes!

249
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,351
Yes!

250
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:44,568
Before long, he only just had to say to me
to go to the little room and I would...

251
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,906
I would start to get wet.

252
00:19:54,828 --> 00:20:02,127
When it came to my brothers or
even just threatened that...

253
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,130
that was enough.

254
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,215
I’d have to go down and...

255
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:10,094
I wanted to lie down and touch myself.

256
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:14,223
Later, at school, anything would...

257
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:20,062
set it off, any kind of humiliation.

258
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:23,107
I looked for any humiliation.

259
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:29,446
Even here when you hit
my coat with your stick.

260
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:34,243
I had to come back right
away, I was so excited.

261
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,794
There’s...

262
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,424
there’s no hope for me.

263
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:53,134
I’m vile and filthy and corrupt.

264
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,394
I must...

265
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,440
I must never be let out of here.

266
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,571
So good to meet you at long last.

267
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:52,446
Professor Freud.

268
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:55,700
You’re most welcome.

269
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:58,035
Please.

270
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,919
Perhaps the terms themselves
should be reviewed.

271
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:10,808
If, for instance, we could come
up with some milder term than

272
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,468
“libido” we might not encounter
such emotional resistance.

273
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,471
It would make the teaching
side of things much easier.

274
00:22:17,513 --> 00:22:19,640
Is euphemism a good idea?

275
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:23,895
Once they work out what we actually mean,
they’ll be just as appalled as ever.

276
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:28,024
I take your point, but I still
think it’s worth trying to

277
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:30,985
sweeten the pill when it comes
to questions of sexuality.

278
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:35,114
And, by the way, please don’t feel
you have to restrain yourself here.

279
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:39,911
My family are all veterans of the most
unsuitable topics of mealtime conversation.

280
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,038
I have a number of clinical
examples which I believe

281
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,596
support my position with
regard to sexuality.

282
00:22:58,638 --> 00:22:59,889
Hm.

283
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:06,479
And how is your little Russian patient?

284
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:13,361
As I told you, after the initial abreaction
there was the most dramatic improvement.

285
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:15,900
We’ve enrolled her in the
medical school at the

286
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:18,241
University where she’s
doing extremely well.

287
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:22,203
She’s a walking advertisement for the
effectiveness of psychoanalysis.

288
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,747
Psychoanalysis.

289
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:27,375
Oh?

290
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,127
It’s more logical.

291
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:34,090
And it sounds better.

292
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:36,467
If you say so.

293
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:43,516
Are you still treating her?

294
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,021
Yes, and we continue to
unearth new material.

295
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:56,167
For example, the extraordinary procedure she
devised as a small child, where she would sit on

296
00:23:56,168 --> 00:24:02,075
one heel, attempt to defecate and at the same
time try to prevent herself from defecating.

297
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,202
Hm.

298
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:08,165
She said this gave rise to
the most blissful feelings.

299
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,376
Nice story.

300
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:14,572
Those of my patients who remain
fixated at the anal stage of their

301
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:17,550
erotic development often come out
with the most amusing details.

302
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:21,606
And, of course, all of them
are finicky, compulsively

303
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:24,432
tidy, stubborn and extremely
stingy with money.

304
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,976
No doubt your Russian
conforms to this pattern.

305
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:29,729
Well, no, she doesn’t.

306
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:35,369
The masochistic aspects of
her condition are much more

307
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,988
deeply rooted than any anal
fixations we may have uncovered.

308
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,948
The two are intimately connected.

309
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,454
I can only tell you that
she’s rather disorganized,

310
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:49,832
emotionally generous and
exceptionally idealistic.

311
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,877
Well, perhaps it’s a Russian thing.

312
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,006
Is she a virgin?

313
00:24:57,048 --> 00:25:00,091
Yes.

314
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:00,927
Certainly.

315
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:02,428
Mmm.

316
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,138
Almost certainly.

317
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,850
No, certainly.

318
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,271
Hm.

319
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:28,655
I don’t think you have
any notion of the true

320
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:30,957
strengths and depths of the
opposition to our work.

321
00:25:31,874 --> 00:25:36,754
There’s a whole medical establishment, of
course, baying to send Freud to the auto-da-fe.

322
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:40,047
But that’s as nothing compared to
what happens when our ideas begin to

323
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:43,344
trickle through in whatever garbled
form they’re relayed to the public.

324
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:47,765
The denials, the frenzy,
the incoherent rage.

325
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:52,165
But might that not be caused
by your insistence on the

326
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:55,690
exclusively sexual interpretation
of the clinical material?

327
00:25:57,567 --> 00:26:01,821
All I’m doing is pointing out what experience
indicates to me must be the truth.

328
00:26:01,863 --> 00:26:06,033
And I can assure you that in a hundred year's
time, our work will still be rejected.

329
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,038
Columbus, you know, had no idea
what country he’d discovered.

330
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,708
Like him, I’m in the dark.

331
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:18,504
All I know is I’ve set foot on the
shore and the country exists.

332
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,966
I think of you more as Galileo.

333
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:25,583
And your opponents as those
who condemned him, while

334
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,847
refusing even to put their
eye to his telescope.

335
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:32,560
In any event, I have simply opened a door.

336
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:36,022
It’s for the young men like
yourself to walk through it.

337
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,983
I’m sure you have many
more doors to open for us.

338
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:46,489
Of course, there’s the added difficulty,
more ammunition for our enemies,

339
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:52,330
that all of us here in Vienna, in our
psychoanalytical circle, are Jews.

340
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:56,209
I don’t see what difference that makes.

341
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:05,009
That, if I may say so, is an
exquisitely Protestant remark.

342
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,184
I dreamed...

343
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:20,816
I dreamed about a horse being hoisted
by cables to a considerable height.

344
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:25,196
Suddenly, a cable breaks and the
horse is dashed to the ground.

345
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:26,906
But it’s not hurt.

346
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:31,176
It leaps up and gallops away,
impeded only by a heavy

347
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:34,163
log, which it’s obliged
to drag along the ground.

348
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:39,794
Then a rider on a small horse appears in front
of it so that it’s forced to slow down.

349
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:43,257
And a carriage appears in
front of the small horse so

350
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:46,551
that our horse is compelled
to slow down even more.

351
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:53,599
I imagine the horse is yourself.

352
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:55,560
Yes.

353
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:58,771
Your ambition has been
frustrated in some way.

354
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:02,567
The rider slowing me down.

355
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:03,568
Yes.

356
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:07,864
I think this may refer to
my wife’s first pregnancy.

357
00:28:08,823 --> 00:28:11,701
I had to give up an opportunity
to go to America because of it.

358
00:28:11,742 --> 00:28:12,869
Ah.

359
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:19,657
The carriage in front perhaps alludes to
an apprehension that our two daughters,

360
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:24,881
and other children perhaps still to come,
will impede my progress even more.

361
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:28,092
As a father of six, I can vouch for that.

362
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:31,971
Not to mention the inevitable
financial difficulties.

363
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:32,638
No.

364
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:35,057
Fortunately, my wife is extremely wealthy.

365
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:37,727
Ah.

366
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:40,104
Yes.

367
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:42,523
That is fortunate.

368
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:53,743
This log...

369
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,828
Yes?

370
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,874
I think, perhaps, you should entertain the
possibility that it represents the penis.

371
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:04,128
Yes.

372
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:10,614
In which case what may be at issue
is that a certain sexual constraint

373
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:15,181
has been brought about by a fear of a
succession of endless pregnancies.

374
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:20,574
I’m bound to say that if one
of my patients had brought me

375
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:24,065
this dream I might have said
that the number of restraining

376
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:27,789
elements surrounding this unfortunate
horse could perhaps point

377
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:31,280
to the determined suppression
of some unruly sexual desire.

378
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:34,825
Yes.

379
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:37,578
There is that as well.

380
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:54,095
I wonder if you’re aware of the fact that our
conversation has so far lasted 13 hours?

381
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:57,430
I’m so sorry.

382
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,307
I had no idea.

383
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:00,143
My dear young colleague,
please don’t apologize.

384
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:05,398
It was our first meeting, we had a
great deal to say to one another.

385
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:12,697
And unless I’m much
mistaken, we always will.

386
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,118
I shall have to be extremely careful.

387
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:19,079
What do you mean?

388
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,788
Why?

389
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,916
He’s so persuasive, he’s so convincing.

390
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:26,878
He makes you feel you should abandon your
own ideas and simply follow in his wake.

391
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:31,508
His followers in Vienna are
all deeply unimpressive.

392
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:36,721
A crowd of Bohemians and degenerates just
picking up the crumbs from his table.

393
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:39,135
Well, perhaps he’s reached
the stage where obedience

394
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:41,059
is more important to
him than originality.

395
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:42,018
Hm.

396
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,853
I tried to tackle him about his
obsession with sexuality, his

397
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:49,401
insistence on interpreting
every symptom in sexual terms.

398
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:51,820
But he’s completely inflexible.

399
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:55,699
In my case, of course he’d have been right.

400
00:30:56,991 --> 00:31:01,036
Yes, as you would expect
him to be in many cases.

401
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:03,081
Possibly even the majority of cases.

402
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:08,211
But there must be more than
one hinge into the universe.

403
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:32,861
Do you like Wagner?

404
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,405
The music and the man, yes.

405
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:37,532
I’m very interested in
the myth of Siegfried.

406
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:40,868
The idea that something
pure and heroic can come...

407
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:45,040
can perhaps only come...
from a sin, even a sin as dark as incest.

408
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,209
This is very strange.

409
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:49,919
What?

410
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:52,672
As I’ve told you, I don’t
believe in coincidence.

411
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:54,591
I believe nothing happens by accident.

412
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:56,343
All these things have significance.

413
00:31:56,384 --> 00:32:00,180
The fact is I’m in the middle of writing
something myself about the Siegfried myth.

414
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:00,928
Are you really?

415
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:01,598
I assure you.

416
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:04,726
Which is your favourite of the operas?

417
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,227
Das Rheingold.

418
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:08,355
Yes, that’s right.

419
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:09,647
Mine too.

420
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,485
Can I ask you something?

421
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:14,861
Of course.

422
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:21,618
Do you think there’s any possibility
I could ever be a psychiatrist?

423
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:24,454
I know you could.

424
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,291
I hear nothing but good reports
on your work at the university.

425
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,586
You’re exactly the kind of person we need.

426
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:34,464
Insane, you mean?

427
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:38,009
<laughing> Yes.

428
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:41,137
We sane doctors have serious limitations.

429
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:47,345
“Dear Friend, I feel I can, at
last, permit myself this informal

430
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:51,981
mode of address as I ask you to
grant me a very particular favour.

431
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:55,605
Dr. Otto Gross, a most
brilliant but erratic

432
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:59,823
character, is urgently in
need of your medical help.

433
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:03,857
I consider him, apart from
yourself, the only man

434
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,205
capable of making a major
contribution to our field.

435
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:10,725
Whatever you do, don’t let
him out before October

436
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:13,503
when I shall be able to
take him over from you.

437
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:18,508
And remember his father’s
warning, made when Otto was

438
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:22,721
watch out for him, he bites.

439
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:25,557
You still feel threatened by your father?

440
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:32,188
Anyone with any sense feels
threatened by my father.

441
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:35,150
He is extremely threatening.

442
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,830
His wish to have you
hospitalized, you don’t think

443
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:46,369
that arises from a concern
for your welfare?

444
00:33:49,539 --> 00:34:02,510
Listen, what does any normal old patriarch
want in the twilight of his life?

445
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:09,017
Grandchildren, grandsons, am I right?

446
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:14,338
And yet, last summer, when I presented him
with not one, but two little Grosses,

447
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:17,942
one by my wife, one by one of my most
respectable mistresses, was he grateful?

448
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:43,658
And now that there’s another
one on the way, admittedly

449
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:47,138
by some woman I hardly
know, he’s apoplectic.

450
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:51,726
And all he can think is to get me
banged away in some institution.

451
00:34:55,855 --> 00:34:57,315
You got any children?

452
00:34:57,357 --> 00:34:59,234
Two girls.

453
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:00,110
Same mother?

454
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:01,194
Yes.

455
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:08,243
So you’re not a believer in monogamy?

456
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,124
For a neurotic like myself, I can’t
possibly imagine a more stressful concept.

457
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:22,410
And you don’t find it necessary or
desirable to exercise some restraint

458
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:27,054
as a contribution, say, to the
smooth functioning of civilization.

459
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:29,598
What, and make myself ill?

460
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:34,095
I should have thought that
some form of sexual repression

461
00:35:34,096 --> 00:35:36,855
would have to be practiced
in any rational society.

462
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:42,069
No wonder the hospitals
are bulging at the seams.

463
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:50,671
Tell me, do you find the best way
to enhance your popularity with

464
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:54,998
your patients is to tell them whatever
it is they most want to hear?

465
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:58,585
What does it matter whether
we’re popular with them or not?

466
00:35:58,627 --> 00:35:59,711
Well, I don’t know.

467
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,464
Suppose you want to fuck them?

468
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:16,728
If there is one thing I’ve learned in my short
never repress anything.

469
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:06,069
So you’ve never slept with
any of your patients?

470
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:08,197
Of course not.

471
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:12,940
I have to steer through the
temptations of transference and

472
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:16,747
counter-transference and that’s an
essential stage of the process.

473
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:23,873
When transference occurs, when the
patient becomes fixated on me, I explain

474
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:29,634
to her that this is merely a symbol
of her wretched monogamous habits.

475
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:34,984
I assure her that it’s fine to want to sleep
with me, but only if, at the same time,

476
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:40,270
she acknowledges to herself that she wants
to sleep with a great many other people.

477
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:42,439
Suppose she doesn’t?

478
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:46,360
Then it’s my job to convince her
that’s part of the illness.

479
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:52,491
That’s what people are like.

480
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:55,661
If we don’t tell them the truth, who will?

481
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:59,081
You think Freud’s right?

482
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:02,960
You think all neurosis is of
exclusively sexual origin?

483
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:09,394
I think Freud’s obsession
with sex probably has a great

484
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:12,177
deal to do with the fact
that he never gets any.

485
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:14,972
You could be right.

486
00:38:16,557 --> 00:38:23,198
It seems to me a measure of the true perversity
of the human race, that one of its very few

487
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:29,695
reliably pleasurable activities should be the
subject of so much hysteria and repression.

488
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:38,579
But not to repress yourself is to unleash all
kinds of dangerous and destructive forces.

489
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:44,126
Our job is to make our
patients capable of freedom.

490
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:50,674
I’ve heard it said that you helped one
of your patients to kill herself.

491
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:53,677
She was resolutely suicidal.

492
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,681
I just explained how she could
do it without botching it.

493
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:03,270
Then I asked her if she didn’t prefer
the idea of becoming my lover.

494
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:09,401
She opted for both.

495
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:12,946
That can’t be what we
want for our patients.

496
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,828
Freedom is freedom.

497
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:25,042
I’ve been thinking about Wagner’s opera.

498
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:28,777
In it, he says that perfection
can only be arrived at through

499
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:32,174
what is conventionally thought
of as sin, is that right?

500
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:38,430
Which must surely have to do with the energy
created by the friction of opposites.

501
00:39:38,472 --> 00:39:43,936
Not just that you’re the doctor and I’m the
patient, but that you’re Swiss and I’m Russian.

502
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:48,190
I’m Jewish and you’re Aryan and all
other kinds of darker differences.

503
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:50,234
Darker?

504
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:57,658
If I’m right, only the clash of destructive
forces can create something new.

505
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:04,373
When my father brought me to you, I was
very ill and my illness was sexual.

506
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:09,003
It’s clear that the subject I’m studying
is entirely grounded in sexuality.

507
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:11,784
So, naturally, I’m becoming
more and more acutely

508
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,633
aware of the fact that I
have no sexual experience.

509
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,096
Law students are not normally
expected to rob banks.

510
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:37,531
It’s generally thought to be the man
who should take the initiative.

511
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:41,744
Don’t you think there’s
something male in every woman?

512
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:44,038
And something female in every man?

513
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,498
Or should be?

514
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:47,208
Maybe.

515
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:51,253
I expect you’re right, yes.

516
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:57,532
If you ever want to take
the initiative, I live

517
00:40:57,533 --> 00:41:01,514
in that building there,
where the bay window is.

518
00:41:18,072 --> 00:41:19,740
I can’t understand what you’re waiting for.

519
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:26,287
Just take her to some secluded spot and
thrash her to within an inch of her life.

520
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:28,207
That’s clearly what she wants.

521
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,919
How can you deny her
such a simple pleasure?

522
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,964
Pleasure is never simple,
as you very well know.

523
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:38,175
It is.

524
00:41:39,135 --> 00:41:40,219
Of course it is.

525
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,097
Until we decide to complicate it.

526
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:46,600
What my father calls maturity.

527
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:49,395
What I call surrender.

528
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:54,025
Surrender, for me, would be
to give in to these urges.

529
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:55,526
Then surrender.

530
00:41:57,486 --> 00:42:01,157
It doesn’t matter what you call it as long
as you don’t let the experience escape.

531
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:05,786
That’s my prescription.

532
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:09,248
I’m supposed to be treating you.

533
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,209
And it’s been most effective.

534
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:19,508
<laughing> I’d say the analysis
was not too far from completion.

535
00:42:21,677 --> 00:42:23,220
Mine, yes.

536
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:26,557
Not so sure about yours.

537
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:31,742
I’ve been spending so much
time with him, I’m afraid

538
00:42:31,743 --> 00:42:34,398
I’ve been neglecting some
of my other patients.

539
00:42:36,942 --> 00:42:42,573
He’s immensely seductive, quite sure
he’s right and obsessionally neurotic.

540
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:46,035
Pretty dangerous, in fact.

541
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:51,665
Do you mean you doubt your
powers to convince him?

542
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:53,959
Worse than that.

543
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,880
What I’m afraid of is his
power to convince me.

544
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:03,352
On the subject of monogamy, for
example, why should we put so much

545
00:43:03,353 --> 00:43:07,223
frantic effort into suppressing
our most basic natural instincts?

546
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,726
I don’t know.

547
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:11,811
You tell me.

548
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:25,199
Thank you.

549
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:28,327
I really needed that.

550
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:13,247
“Dr. Jung, rest assured that thanks
to you, I am alive and healthy.

551
00:44:14,248 --> 00:44:18,085
But please be so good as to
tell my father that I am dead.

552
00:44:19,754 --> 00:44:24,592
And whatever you do, do not pass by
the oasis without stopping to drink.

553
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:26,510
Otto.

554
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,659
Who is it?

555
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:53,496
A friend.

556
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:02,588
Come inside.

557
00:45:56,976 --> 00:45:57,893
It’s so beautiful.

558
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,272
I feel as though we’ve always lived here.

559
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:04,316
They say we’ll be able to move
in by the end of the week.

560
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:08,988
I’m sorry to be like this again.

561
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:10,740
What do you mean?

562
00:46:12,324 --> 00:46:14,076
So big and unattractive.

563
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:15,619
Don’t be absurd.

564
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,624
I expect you wish you were a
polygamist, like Otto Gross.

565
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,885
If I were, it would be something quite
different than what we have, which is sacred.

566
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:34,513
I would have to be sure
you understood that.

567
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:38,893
I wouldn’t want to know anything about it.

568
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,230
I have a surprise for you.

569
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:56,077
The boat you always wanted with red sails.

570
00:46:59,413 --> 00:47:00,289
Thank you.

571
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,710
Thank you for all of this.

572
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:07,046
You’re a good man.

573
00:47:08,756 --> 00:47:10,925
You deserve everything that’s good.

574
00:47:25,731 --> 00:47:29,777
If I say something, will you promise
not to take it the wrong way?

575
00:47:32,154 --> 00:47:33,072
What?

576
00:47:37,326 --> 00:47:38,953
Don’t you think we ought to stop...

577
00:47:38,994 --> 00:47:41,080
now?

578
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,418
I’m married.

579
00:47:46,752 --> 00:47:48,462
Obviously, I’m being deceitful.

580
00:47:50,631 --> 00:47:53,092
Is it right for us to
perpetuate this deceit?

581
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:54,927
Do you want to stop?

582
00:47:56,137 --> 00:47:57,304
Of course I don’t.

583
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:08,691
When you make love to your wife, how is it?

584
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:11,610
Describe it to me.

585
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:20,411
When you live under the same roof
with someone, it becomes habit.

586
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:25,124
You know, it’s always very tender.

587
00:48:27,335 --> 00:48:29,003
Then this is another thing.

588
00:48:30,546 --> 00:48:34,133
Another thing in another country.

589
00:48:40,306 --> 00:48:44,435
With me, I want you to be ferocious.

590
00:48:47,188 --> 00:48:48,814
I want you to punish me.

591
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:08,876
I knew it was a boy this time.

592
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:10,753
I told you.

593
00:49:11,462 --> 00:49:12,630
I believed you.

594
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:19,345
Will you come back to us now?

595
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:24,202
Pity.

596
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:27,455
I should never have sent
Doctor Gross to you.

597
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:29,415
I blame myself.

598
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,751
No, I’m very grateful you did.

599
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:35,630
All those provocative discussions helped
crystallize a lot of my thinking.

600
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:37,257
Hm.

601
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:40,927
Did he really send you his hotel bill?

602
00:50:42,136 --> 00:50:43,596
Only for a couple of nights.

603
00:50:47,308 --> 00:50:48,434
He’s an addict.

604
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:50,353
I can see that now.

605
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:54,232
He can only end by doing
great harm to our movement.

606
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:02,115
You realize this makes you
undisputed Crown Prince, don’t you?

607
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:04,325
My son and heir?

608
00:51:05,743 --> 00:51:08,371
I’m not sure I deserve such an accolade.

609
00:51:08,913 --> 00:51:10,498
Don’t say another word.

610
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:16,129
I often take my walk up here.

611
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,675
It’s inspired some of my best ideas.

612
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:24,304
You mustn’t think I have a closed mind.

613
00:51:24,345 --> 00:51:27,834
I have absolutely no
objection to your studying

614
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:31,686
telepathy or parapsychology
to your heart’s content.

615
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:37,516
But I would make the point that our
own field is so embattled that

616
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:40,904
it can only be dangerous to stray
into any kind of mysticism.

617
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:42,906
Don’t you see?

618
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:46,326
We have to stay within the most
rigorously scientific confines.

619
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,539
Are you all right?

620
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:54,583
Yes, but I can’t agree with you.

621
00:51:54,584 --> 00:52:00,632
Why should we draw some arbitrary line and
rule out whole areas of investigation?

622
00:52:00,673 --> 00:52:03,224
Precisely because the
world is full of enemies

623
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:05,720
looking for any way they
can to discredit us.

624
00:52:05,762 --> 00:52:10,027
And the moment they see us abandon
the firm ground of sexual theory

625
00:52:10,028 --> 00:52:13,853
to wallow in the black mud of
superstition they will pounce.

626
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:23,738
As far as I’m concerned, even to raise
these subjects is professional suicide.

627
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:28,993
I knew that was going to happen!

628
00:52:29,035 --> 00:52:30,119
What?

629
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,622
I felt something like
that was going to happen.

630
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:34,499
I had a kind of burning in my stomach.

631
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,000
What are you talking about?

632
00:52:37,085 --> 00:52:38,086
It’s the heating.

633
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:40,755
The wood in the bookcase
just cracked, that’s all.

634
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:41,297
No.

635
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:44,300
It’s what’s known as a catalytic
exteriorization phenomenon.

636
00:52:44,843 --> 00:52:45,593
A what?

637
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:48,680
A catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.

638
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:50,139
Don’t be ridiculous.

639
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:52,058
My diaphragm started to glow red hot.

640
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:57,063
And another thing... it’s
going to happen again.

641
00:52:57,105 --> 00:52:57,814
What?

642
00:52:57,856 --> 00:52:59,816
In a minute, it’s going to happen again.

643
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:03,862
My dear young friend, this is exactly
the kind of thing I’m talking about.

644
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:06,489
You see?

645
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:08,616
That’s just...

646
00:53:08,658 --> 00:53:10,577
you really can’t be serious.

647
00:53:10,618 --> 00:53:14,622
There are so many mysteries,
so much further to go.

648
00:53:14,664 --> 00:53:15,248
Please.

649
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,332
We can’t be too careful.

650
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:19,669
We can’t afford to wander
into these speculative areas.

651
00:53:19,711 --> 00:53:24,257
Telepathy, singing bookcases, fairies
at the bottom of the garden.

652
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:26,009
It won’t do.

653
00:53:30,847 --> 00:53:31,764
It won’t do.

654
00:53:55,788 --> 00:54:01,471
There’s a poem by Lermontov keeps going
round my head about a prisoner who finally

655
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:06,674
achieves some happiness when he succeeds
in releasing a bird from its cage.

656
00:54:07,675 --> 00:54:09,761
Why do you think this is preoccupying you?

657
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:16,414
I think it means that when I
become a doctor what I want

658
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:21,272
more than anything is to give
people back their freedom...

659
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:24,817
the way you gave me mine.

660
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:27,611
Right.

661
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:28,988
That’s enough now.

662
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:34,369
There we go.

663
00:54:37,247 --> 00:54:38,289
Fascinating.

664
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:40,250
Come along, my dear.

665
00:54:43,336 --> 00:54:46,130
All the standard symptoms
of the nymphomaniac.

666
00:54:50,552 --> 00:54:51,386
Yes.

667
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:57,392
Except that whenever anyone responded
to her advances, she would run a mile.

668
00:54:58,685 --> 00:55:00,520
That’s the puzzling feature of the case.

669
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:04,315
Hm.

670
00:55:06,192 --> 00:55:10,196
I must say it’s a great pleasure to
see you in your natural habitat.

671
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:28,677
There’s a rumour running
around Vienna that

672
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:31,050
you’ve taken one of your
patients as a mistress.

673
00:55:34,345 --> 00:55:35,805
It’s absolutely untrue.

674
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:38,349
Well, of course it is.

675
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:41,186
So I’ve been telling everyone.

676
00:55:41,227 --> 00:55:43,271
What’s being said?

677
00:55:43,313 --> 00:55:45,565
Oh, I don’t know.

678
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:48,443
That the woman’s been bragging about it.

679
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:51,779
That somebody is sending
out anonymous letters.

680
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:53,031
The usual sort of thing.

681
00:55:55,033 --> 00:55:57,035
Bound to happen sooner or later.

682
00:55:58,494 --> 00:56:00,288
It’s an occupational hazard.

683
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:04,709
Yes.

684
00:56:06,294 --> 00:56:09,839
I hope I’d never be stupid enough to get
emotionally involved with a patient.

685
00:56:14,135 --> 00:56:15,053
I’m confused.

686
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,429
I feel trapped.

687
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:20,517
I’ve trapped myself into
feeling divided, guilty.

688
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:22,560
I’ve never wanted you to feel guilty.

689
00:56:22,602 --> 00:56:24,229
I don’t see how we can go on.

690
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:28,066
You mustn’t say that.

691
00:56:28,107 --> 00:56:29,192
I have some kind of illness.

692
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:33,112
Try to remember the love and patience I
showed towards you when you were ill.

693
00:56:33,154 --> 00:56:34,113
That’s what I need from you now.

694
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:34,781
Of course.

695
00:56:34,822 --> 00:56:36,282
You have it always.

696
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:38,575
Oh, please don’t go.

697
00:56:38,576 --> 00:56:39,327
I must.

698
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,495
I have to.

699
00:56:40,537 --> 00:56:41,079
No.

700
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,994
I have to.

701
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:42,789
No!

702
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:45,208
I have to!

703
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:04,269
I can’t say I’m sorry
to say goodbye to him.

704
00:57:05,436 --> 00:57:07,313
Not the easiest house-guest we’ve ever had.

705
00:57:08,147 --> 00:57:09,065
No.

706
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:13,069
I don’t think he ever recovered
from the first view of the house.

707
00:57:14,863 --> 00:57:19,158
Still, I suppose compared to
that tiny flat in Vienna...

708
00:57:24,372 --> 00:57:26,582
Why did he refuse to
meet the Herr Direktor?

709
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:30,920
Oh, he’s always been a great one for
bearing incomprehensible grudges.

710
00:57:33,256 --> 00:57:36,009
Did he say anything to you
about anonymous letters?

711
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:45,810
Surely you didn’t think I’d let you
go without putting up a fight?

712
00:57:53,985 --> 00:57:54,903
Secretary Fraulein Spielrein!

713
00:57:58,239 --> 00:57:59,532
Why are you doing this?

714
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,244
Please sit down.

715
00:58:03,286 --> 00:58:04,621
And how could you treat me this way?

716
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:07,832
Sit down.

717
00:58:17,467 --> 00:58:19,761
I tried to explain the
situation to your mother.

718
00:58:19,802 --> 00:58:21,721
I don’t know how you dared
say those things to her.

719
00:58:21,763 --> 00:58:25,475
She came in waving an anonymous letter
demanding to know if it was true.

720
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:30,364
I told her even if it were,
the position would not be

721
00:58:30,365 --> 00:58:33,733
quite as she imagined, since
you’re no longer my patient.

722
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:35,818
Of course I’m your patient.

723
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,903
Technically not.

724
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:38,488
Not since I stopped charging you.

725
00:58:39,364 --> 00:58:40,615
That’s what she said.

726
00:58:41,908 --> 00:58:44,995
I told her I didn’t believe
her and she told me

727
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:48,081
you said your fee was 20
francs a consultation.

728
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:51,216
I was trying to make the point that
I would take you back as a patient

729
00:58:51,217 --> 00:58:53,962
but that I could only undertake
to see you inside this office.

730
00:58:55,922 --> 00:59:00,718
How can you be so cold and offhand?

731
00:59:02,095 --> 00:59:06,432
I was trying to make her understand the
distinction between a patient and a friend.

732
00:59:13,857 --> 00:59:18,403
Listen... I’ve made a stupid mistake.

733
00:59:18,444 --> 00:59:19,863
Is that what it was?

734
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:23,408
I broke one of the elementary
rules of my profession.

735
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:27,161
I’m your doctor and I believe
I did you some good.

736
00:59:28,162 --> 00:59:30,373
I can’t forgive myself for
overstepping the mark.

737
00:59:30,415 --> 00:59:32,846
I should have known that
if I gave you what you

738
00:59:32,847 --> 00:59:35,378
wanted you wouldn’t be
able to help wanting more.

739
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,296
I don’t want more.

740
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:37,839
And I never wanted more.

741
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:38,965
I never asked for more.

742
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:40,925
You didn’t have to ask.

743
00:59:41,885 --> 00:59:44,792
And even if you’re right,
which I dispute, do you

744
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:47,640
think this is a proper way
to behave towards me?

745
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:49,475
Refusing to speak to me
except in your office?

746
00:59:49,517 --> 00:59:50,476
I’m your physician.

747
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,230
From now on, that’s all I can be.

748
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:58,151
Don’t you love me anymore?

749
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,406
Only as your physician.

750
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:08,662
You think I’m going to stand for this?

751
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:10,205
What choice do you have?

752
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:26,471
And there’s your 20 francs.

753
01:00:37,232 --> 01:00:41,228
“Dear Professor Freud, I would be most
grateful if you would allow me to

754
01:00:41,229 --> 01:00:45,115
come and visit you in Vienna on a
matter of great interest to us both.

755
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:54,707
“Dear Friend, I have just received
this extremely strange letter.

756
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:56,626
Do you know this woman?

757
01:00:57,294 --> 01:00:58,295
Who is she?

758
01:01:04,176 --> 01:01:09,228
“As you will not doubt recall, Spielrein was
the case that brought you and me together,

759
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:13,935
for which reason I’ve always regarded her
with special gratitude and affection...

760
01:01:15,479 --> 01:01:18,398
until I understood that she was
systematically planning my seduction.

761
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,235
Now I have no idea what
her intentions may be.

762
01:01:22,277 --> 01:01:24,654
Revenge, I suspect.

763
01:01:26,782 --> 01:01:29,326
I have never shown such
friendship to a patient.

764
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:32,579
Nor have I ever been made to
suffer so much in return.

765
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:38,210
I am hoping you will agree to act as a
kind of go-between and avert a disaster.

766
01:01:40,754 --> 01:01:44,560
Your famous saying is carved in
block letters on my heart...

767
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:48,178
whatever you do, give up any
idea of trying to cure them.

768
01:01:55,143 --> 01:02:01,024
“Experiences like this, however painful,
are necessary and inevitable.

769
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:04,027
Without them, how can we know life?

770
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:10,158
“Dear Miss Spielrein, Dr.

771
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,902
Jung is a good friend and
colleague of mine whom I believe

772
01:02:13,903 --> 01:02:17,040
to be incapable of frivolous
or shabby behaviour.

773
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:23,964
What I infer from your letter is that you used
to be close friends, but are no longer so.

774
01:02:25,215 --> 01:02:28,682
If this is the case I would
urge you to consider whether

775
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:32,209
the feelings that have survived
this close friendship are

776
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:35,251
not best suppressed and
forgotten and without the

777
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:39,021
intervention and involvement of
third persons such as myself.

778
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:48,572
Herr Doctor.

779
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:50,866
Fraulein Spielrein.

780
01:03:01,084 --> 01:03:01,835
What is it?

781
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:05,715
I heard you were leaving the hospital.

782
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:08,468
As you see.

783
01:03:10,178 --> 01:03:12,472
People are saying it’s because
of the scandal I caused.

784
01:03:12,513 --> 01:03:14,182
I’d been planning to leave anyway.

785
01:03:16,851 --> 01:03:20,730
Well, I’m sorry if... I precipitated it.

786
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:25,068
You’ve always been something of a catalyst.

787
01:03:29,197 --> 01:03:31,741
I’ve had a letter from Professor Freud.

788
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:35,661
Oh, yes?

789
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:39,040
The thing that shone through
was how much he loves you.

790
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:45,088
But... what was also clear is
that you denied everything.

791
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:48,758
You let him think I was
a fantasist or a liar.

792
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:51,552
I don’t see that it’s any of his business.

793
01:03:53,638 --> 01:03:55,390
I’ve come here to ask
you to tell the truth.

794
01:03:58,226 --> 01:03:58,893
What?

795
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:02,062
I want you to write to him
and tell him everything.

796
01:04:02,063 --> 01:04:05,233
And then I want him to write to me again to
confirm that you’ve told him everything.

797
01:04:08,027 --> 01:04:09,237
Are you blackmailing me?

798
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,452
I’m asking you to tell the truth.

799
01:04:16,494 --> 01:04:19,122
Why is this so important to you?

800
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,917
I want him to take me as his patient.

801
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:32,635
Does it have to be him?

802
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:36,097
It has to be him.

803
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,647
You don’t feel the same
way about him, do you?

804
01:04:44,689 --> 01:04:49,616
I’m disappointed by his rigid pragmatism,
his insistence that nothing can possibly

805
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:54,365
exist unless some puny or transitory
intelligence has first become aware of it.

806
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:57,827
All the same, will you write to him?

807
01:04:59,787 --> 01:05:01,539
I could have damaged you, you know?

808
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:04,792
Far worse than I did.

809
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,628
I chose not to.

810
01:05:14,302 --> 01:05:15,053
All right.

811
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:16,137
I’ll do it.

812
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:20,975
Thank you.

813
01:05:24,062 --> 01:05:25,355
It means everything to me.

814
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:38,451
Are you going somewhere for the summer?

815
01:05:39,744 --> 01:05:41,329
Berlin with my parents.

816
01:05:43,081 --> 01:05:46,459
But you are going to come back
to the university to qualify?

817
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:49,045
Of course.

818
01:05:53,174 --> 01:05:57,512
I’m going to America with Freud,
although he doesn’t yet know it.

819
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,348
That’s nice.

820
01:06:01,766 --> 01:06:02,517
Good bye.

821
01:06:10,024 --> 01:06:13,573
“...in view of my friendship
for the patient and her

822
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:16,989
complete trust in me, what
I did was indefensible.

823
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:22,412
I confess this, very unhappily,
to you, my father-figure...

824
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:24,163
Hm.

825
01:06:31,045 --> 01:06:34,632
“Dear Miss Spielrein, I owe you an apology.

826
01:06:34,674 --> 01:06:39,018
But the fact that I was wrong and
that the man is to be blamed

827
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:43,224
rather than the woman satisfies
my own need to revere women.

828
01:06:44,017 --> 01:06:47,204
Please… accept my admiration
for the very dignified

829
01:06:47,205 --> 01:06:50,023
way in which you have
resolved this conflict.

830
01:06:54,193 --> 01:06:56,571
Do we have all the necessary
paperwork, Ferenczi?

831
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,198
I have everything, Professor.

832
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,908
Hm.

833
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:02,952
Good.

834
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:04,787
I’ve always been in two
minds about America.

835
01:07:04,829 --> 01:07:07,790
Maybe we made a foolish error.

836
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:10,084
Do they really want us there?

837
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:13,671
They postponed the Congress for two
months so that you could attend.

838
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:15,673
Surely that gives you some indication.

839
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:16,591
Hm.

840
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:17,800
Yes.

841
01:07:17,842 --> 01:07:19,844
I think it’s going to be a great adventure.

842
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:20,720
Yes.

843
01:07:22,513 --> 01:07:23,598
I hope you’re right.

844
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:29,312
I go this way.

845
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:32,106
What do you mean?

846
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:34,776
I left my wife to make the arrangements.

847
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:37,904
I’m afraid she’s booked me
a first-class state room.

848
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:40,573
I see.

849
01:07:58,466 --> 01:08:03,429
I was on the Swiss-Austrian border
somewhere in the mountains at dusk.

850
01:08:03,471 --> 01:08:08,976
There was a long wait because
everybody’s baggage was being searched.

851
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:16,192
I noticed a decrepit customs official
wearing the old royal and imperial uniform.

852
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:20,745
And I was watching him walking up
and down with his melancholy and

853
01:08:20,746 --> 01:08:25,659
disgruntled expression, when someone
said to me, “He isn’t really there.

854
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:30,331
He’s a ghost who still hasn’t
found out how to die properly.

855
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:36,838
Is that the whole dream?

856
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,339
All I can remember.

857
01:08:42,427 --> 01:08:44,554
Did you say the Swiss-Austrian border?

858
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:45,513
Yes.

859
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:48,391
Must have something to do with us.

860
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:50,518
You think so?

861
01:08:54,605 --> 01:08:59,610
<clears throat> Everybody’s being searched.

862
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:01,028
Hm?

863
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:05,733
Perhaps that’s an indication that
the ideas which used to flow so

864
01:09:05,734 --> 01:09:10,580
freely between us are now subject
to a most suspicious examination.

865
01:09:10,621 --> 01:09:12,457
You mean the ideas flowing
in your direction.

866
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:16,596
And I’m afraid the old relic
shuffling about in this

867
01:09:16,597 --> 01:09:19,963
entirely useless fashion
must almost certainly be me.

868
01:09:19,964 --> 01:09:20,715
Wait a minute.

869
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:23,968
Whom you very mercifully wish
could be put out of his misery.

870
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:27,263
A humane death wish.

871
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:35,855
Perhaps the fact that he was unable to die
simply indicated the immortality of his ideas.

872
01:09:35,897 --> 01:09:36,689
Oh.

873
01:09:37,982 --> 01:09:38,941
Yes.

874
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:45,490
So you agree it must have been me?

875
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:47,200
I didn’t say that.

876
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:48,409
No.

877
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,953
Never mind.

878
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:55,208
It’s a most entertaining example.

879
01:09:57,919 --> 01:09:58,961
What about you?

880
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,797
Do you have a dream to report?

881
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:05,593
I had a most elaborate dream last night.

882
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,637
Particularly rich.

883
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:11,849
Well, let’s hear it.

884
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:18,189
I’d love to tell you but
I don’t think I should.

885
01:10:20,692 --> 01:10:21,818
Why ever not?

886
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:29,325
I wouldn’t want to risk my authority.

887
01:10:52,473 --> 01:10:55,852
Take it from me, what you’re
looking at is the future.

888
01:10:57,895 --> 01:11:01,691
You think they know we’re on our
way, bringing them the plague?

889
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:29,802
Fraulein Spielrein.

890
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,516
Whose idea was it for you to
send me your dissertation?

891
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,561
The Herr Direktor.

892
01:11:38,603 --> 01:11:40,730
Yes, of course.

893
01:11:43,983 --> 01:11:48,738
He kept insisting this was the kind of material
you were looking for for your Yearbook.

894
01:11:50,365 --> 01:11:53,617
It certainly is a very fascinating
case you’ve chosen to investigate.

895
01:11:53,618 --> 01:11:56,676
But if we’re to consider it
for the Yearbook, there are

896
01:11:56,677 --> 01:11:59,624
one or two mistakes which
will have to be dealt with.

897
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:01,209
Of course.

898
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,754
Might you have a little
time to discuss all this?

899
01:12:06,964 --> 01:12:07,882
Yes.

900
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:16,485
When I left the hospital and moved
out here I was afraid it would take

901
01:12:16,486 --> 01:12:19,811
years to build up a roster of
patients but I’m already under siege.

902
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,234
Anyway, I don’t see why a
little more work won’t

903
01:12:25,235 --> 01:12:27,819
make your dissertation
eminently publishable.

904
01:12:29,153 --> 01:12:31,447
Do you think we’d be able to
work on it together without...?

905
01:12:37,995 --> 01:12:41,708
It’s always going to be something
of a risk, us seeing one another.

906
01:12:43,501 --> 01:12:44,335
Yes.

907
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:48,423
But I believe we have the character to be
able to deal with the situation, don’t you?

908
01:12:49,757 --> 01:12:50,842
I hope so.

909
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,432
I somehow imagined you’d have
found another admirer by now.

910
01:12:59,058 --> 01:12:59,809
No.

911
01:13:02,186 --> 01:13:03,938
You were the jewel of great price.

912
01:13:11,696 --> 01:13:13,698
Shall we say this time next Tuesday?

913
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:17,118
And I’ll start gently
ripping you to shreds.

914
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:31,758
Explain this analogy you make between the
sex instinct and the death instinct.

915
01:13:33,468 --> 01:13:39,640
Professor Freud claims that the sexual drive
arises from a simple urge towards pleasure.

916
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:43,811
If he’s right, the question is why is this
urge so often successfully repressed?

917
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:47,378
You used to have a theory
involving the impulse towards

918
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:50,526
destruction and self-destruction,
losing oneself.

919
01:13:50,568 --> 01:13:56,089
Well, suppose we think of sexuality as fusion...
losing oneself, as you say, but

920
01:13:56,090 --> 01:14:01,746
losing oneself in the other...
in other words, destroying one’s own individuality.

921
01:14:01,788 --> 01:14:05,541
Wouldn’t the ego, in self-defense,
automatically resist that impulse?

922
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:08,419
You mean for selfish not
for social reasons?

923
01:14:08,461 --> 01:14:09,128
Yes.

924
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:14,467
I’m saying that perhaps true sexuality
demands the destruction of the ego.

925
01:14:17,011 --> 01:14:20,056
In other words, the opposite
of what Freud proposes.

926
01:15:01,389 --> 01:15:04,100
When I graduate, I’ve
decided to leave Zurich.

927
01:15:09,397 --> 01:15:10,398
I have to.

928
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:14,861
Why?

929
01:15:14,902 --> 01:15:16,863
You know why.

930
01:15:23,745 --> 01:15:24,704
It’s true.

931
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,794
I’m nothing but a philistine Swiss
bourgeois complacent coward.

932
01:15:31,836 --> 01:15:37,884
I want to leave everything, break
away and disappear with you.

933
01:15:42,013 --> 01:15:44,057
Then comes the voice of the philistine.

934
01:15:48,728 --> 01:15:49,687
Where will you go?

935
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:52,231
Vienna, maybe.

936
01:15:53,274 --> 01:15:54,400
Please don’t go there.

937
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:58,780
I must go wherever I need to feel free.

938
01:16:11,084 --> 01:16:11,918
<sobbing> Don’t...

939
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:27,767
You know your paper...

940
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:31,067
led to one of the most
stimulating discussions

941
01:16:31,068 --> 01:16:33,481
we’ve ever had at the
Psychoanalytic Society.

942
01:16:35,066 --> 01:16:39,320
Do you really think the sexual drive
is a demonic and destructive force?

943
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:44,002
Yes, at the same time as being a
creative force, in the sense that it can

944
01:16:44,003 --> 01:16:48,329
produce, out of the destruction of
two individualities, a new being.

945
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:51,525
But the individual must always
overcome resistance because

946
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:54,252
of the self-annihilating
nature of the sexual act.

947
01:16:56,838 --> 01:16:57,797
Hm.

948
01:16:57,839 --> 01:17:03,050
I’ve fought against the idea for
some time, but I suppose there

949
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:08,099
must be some kind of indissoluble
link between sex and death.

950
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:13,993
I don’t feel the relationship between the
two is quite the way you have portrayed it,

951
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:17,942
but I’m most grateful to you for animating
the subject in such a stimulating way.

952
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:22,352
The only slight shock was
your introduction, at the

953
01:17:22,353 --> 01:17:25,283
very end of your paper,
of the name of Christ.

954
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:32,498
Are you completely opposed to any kind
of religious dimension in our field?

955
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:35,904
In general, I don’t care if a
man believes in Rama, Marx or

956
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:39,380
Aphrodite, as long as he keeps
it out of the consulting room.

957
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:42,759
Is that what’s at the bottom
of your dispute with Dr.

958
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,343
Jung?

959
01:17:43,344 --> 01:17:46,554
I have no dispute with Dr.

960
01:17:46,596 --> 01:17:47,055
Jung.

961
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:50,183
I was simply mistaken about him.

962
01:17:51,392 --> 01:17:54,728
I thought he was going to be able to
carry our work forward after I was gone.

963
01:17:54,729 --> 01:17:59,609
I didn’t bargain for all that second-rate
mysticism and self-aggrandizing shamanism.

964
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:04,655
Nor did I realize he could be
so brutal and sanctimonious.

965
01:18:04,697 --> 01:18:08,550
He’s trying to find some way
forward so that we don’t just have

966
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:12,163
to tell our patients, “This is
why you are the way you are.

967
01:18:12,205 --> 01:18:16,584
” He wants to be able to say, “We can show
you what it is you might want to become.

968
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:18,628
Playing God, in other words.

969
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:21,089
We have no right to do that.

970
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:24,509
The world is as it is.

971
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:30,390
Understanding and accepting that
is the way to psychic health.

972
01:18:30,431 --> 01:18:36,604
What good can we do if our aim is simply
to replace one delusion with another?

973
01:18:40,566 --> 01:18:41,984
Well, I agree with you.

974
01:18:43,736 --> 01:18:44,529
Hm.

975
01:18:45,571 --> 01:18:48,740
I’ve noticed that in the crucial
areas of dispute between Dr.

976
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:50,451
Jung and myself, you tend to favour me.

977
01:18:51,536 --> 01:18:53,538
I thought you had no dispute with him.

978
01:18:54,747 --> 01:18:55,623
Hm.

979
01:18:59,127 --> 01:19:00,461
You still love him.

980
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,964
That’s not why I’m pleading his cause.

981
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:08,350
I just feel that if you two don’t
find some way to co-exist, it will

982
01:19:08,351 --> 01:19:13,307
hold back the progress of
psychoanalysis, perhaps indefinitely.

983
01:19:14,726 --> 01:19:16,686
Is there no way to avert a rupture?

984
01:19:16,728 --> 01:19:21,482
Correct scientific relations
will be maintained, of course.

985
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:24,098
I’ll be seeing him at the
editorial meeting in

986
01:19:24,099 --> 01:19:26,946
Munich in September and I
shall be perfectly civil.

987
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:32,702
To tell you the truth, what finished him
for me was all that business about you.

988
01:19:32,744 --> 01:19:35,455
The lies, the ruthless behaviour.

989
01:19:35,496 --> 01:19:37,290
I was very shocked.

990
01:19:39,709 --> 01:19:41,002
I think he loved me.

991
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:47,633
I’m afraid your idea of a mystical union with
a blond Siegfried was inevitably doomed.

992
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:55,016
Put not your trust in Aryans.

993
01:19:56,768 --> 01:20:03,024
We’re Jews, my dear Miss Spielrein,
and Jews we will always be.

994
01:20:06,653 --> 01:20:11,211
Now, the real reason I invited
you here this evening was to ask

995
01:20:11,212 --> 01:20:15,412
if you’d be prepared to take
on one or two of my patients?

996
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:23,172
I was interested in what you
said about monotheism...

997
01:20:23,173 --> 01:20:26,590
that it arose historically out of
some kind of patricidal impulse.

998
01:20:26,631 --> 01:20:27,632
Yes.

999
01:20:27,674 --> 01:20:31,673
Akhnaton, who, as far as we
know, was the first to put

1000
01:20:31,674 --> 01:20:35,599
forth the bizarre notion
that there was only one God.

1001
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:42,229
Also had his father’s name erased and
chiseled out of all public monuments.

1002
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:43,481
That’s not strictly true.

1003
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:45,317
Not true?

1004
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:46,526
No.

1005
01:20:47,903 --> 01:20:50,071
You mean it was most probably a myth?

1006
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:51,448
No.

1007
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:55,768
I mean there were two perfectly straightforward
reasons for Akhnaton, or Amenhopis

1008
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:59,789
IV as I prefer to call him, to excise
his father’s name from the car touches.

1009
01:20:59,831 --> 01:21:04,012
First, this was something traditionally
done by all new kings who

1010
01:21:04,013 --> 01:21:08,256
didn’t wish their father’s name to
continue to be public currency.

1011
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:13,887
In much the same way as your article in
the Yearbook fails to mention my name?

1012
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:17,891
Your name is so well-known it hardly
seemed necessary to mention it.

1013
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:19,434
Do go on.

1014
01:21:19,476 --> 01:21:22,524
Secondly, Amenhopis only
struck out the first half

1015
01:21:22,525 --> 01:21:25,572
of his father’s name,
Amenhotep, because, like the

1016
01:21:25,573 --> 01:21:28,620
first half of his own name,
it was shared by Amon,

1017
01:21:28,621 --> 01:21:31,488
one of the gods he was
determined to eliminate.

1018
01:21:32,405 --> 01:21:33,281
Hm.

1019
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:35,575
As simple as that?

1020
01:21:35,617 --> 01:21:38,954
The explanation doesn’t
seem to me unduly simple.

1021
01:21:38,995 --> 01:21:43,719
And do you think your man,
whatever you call him,

1022
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:48,255
felt no hostility whatsoever
toward his father?

1023
01:21:48,296 --> 01:21:50,548
I have no means of proof, of course.

1024
01:21:50,549 --> 01:21:54,606
For all I know, Amenhopis may have
thought that his father’s name was quite

1025
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:58,557
familiar enough and that now it might
be time to make a name for himself.

1026
01:22:18,827 --> 01:22:22,664
How sweet it must be to die.

1027
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:30,284
“If I may say so, dear
Professor, you make the

1028
01:22:30,285 --> 01:22:33,466
mistake of treating your
friends like patients.

1029
01:22:33,508 --> 01:22:38,344
This enables you to reduce them to the level
of children, so that their only choice

1030
01:22:38,345 --> 01:22:42,893
is to become obsequious nonentities or
bullying enforcers of the party line...

1031
01:22:43,435 --> 01:22:49,263
while you sit on the mountaintop, the infallible
father-figure and nobody dares to pluck you by

1032
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:55,030
the beard and say, Think about your behaviour and
then decide which one of us is the neurotic.

1033
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:56,740
I speak as a friend.

1034
01:22:56,781 --> 01:22:58,283
Hm.

1035
01:23:19,012 --> 01:23:21,097
“Your letter cannot be answered.

1036
01:23:21,139 --> 01:23:27,019
Your claim that I treat my friends like
patients is self-evidently untrue.

1037
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:31,350
As to which of us is the neurotic,
I thought we analysts were

1038
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:35,820
agreed a little neurosis was
nothing whatever to be ashamed of.

1039
01:23:35,862 --> 01:23:41,384
But a man like you, who behaves quite
abnormally and then stands there shouting at

1040
01:23:41,385 --> 01:23:46,706
the top of his voice how normal he is
does give considerable cause for concern.

1041
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:52,796
For a long time now our relationship
has been hanging by a thread.

1042
01:23:52,838 --> 01:23:58,593
And a thread, moreover, mostly
consisting of past disappointments.

1043
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:01,805
We have nothing to lose by cutting it.

1044
01:24:13,316 --> 01:24:15,986
“You will be the best judge of
what this moment means to you.

1045
01:24:17,571 --> 01:24:18,864
The rest is silence.

1046
01:24:46,975 --> 01:24:49,519
So good to have met you
at last, Dr. Spielrein.

1047
01:24:50,729 --> 01:24:54,691
We did meet once before when I
was your husband’s patient.

1048
01:24:57,277 --> 01:24:58,278
I think you’re right.

1049
01:25:03,325 --> 01:25:05,076
Your children are glorious.

1050
01:25:07,829 --> 01:25:08,663
Thank you.

1051
01:25:08,664 --> 01:25:10,999
You must let us know when yours arrives.

1052
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:12,959
I expect you want a boy.

1053
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:13,668
No.

1054
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:17,756
No, my husband and I both
think we would prefer a girl.

1055
01:25:17,797 --> 01:25:19,007
Really?

1056
01:25:26,389 --> 01:25:27,516
I wish you could help him.

1057
01:25:28,475 --> 01:25:29,601
Why?

1058
01:25:29,643 --> 01:25:30,227
What’s the matter?

1059
01:25:30,228 --> 01:25:31,561
He’s not himself.

1060
01:25:33,313 --> 01:25:36,066
He’s very confused and
bogged down with his book.

1061
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:38,401
He’s not sleeping.

1062
01:25:38,443 --> 01:25:41,196
He’s not taking on any new patients.

1063
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:45,825
He still hasn’t recovered from the violence
of his break with Professor Freud.

1064
01:25:47,327 --> 01:25:50,997
What you’re describing is
very unlike my memory of him.

1065
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:55,710
If you were staying in town, I’d try to
persuade him to let you analyze him.

1066
01:25:59,756 --> 01:26:04,427
I know he always set great
store by your opinion.

1067
01:26:06,388 --> 01:26:07,889
You are taking patients now?

1068
01:26:07,931 --> 01:26:13,603
I’ve pretty much decided to
specialize in child psychology.

1069
01:26:13,645 --> 01:26:17,398
I’m not sure if it’s a
field he approves of.

1070
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:19,609
I haven’t discussed it with him but...

1071
01:26:22,946 --> 01:26:24,531
You better go and talk to him.

1072
01:26:32,831 --> 01:26:34,833
No one can help him more than you.

1073
01:26:35,792 --> 01:26:36,918
I hope you’re right.

1074
01:26:59,733 --> 01:27:01,443
Your children are beautiful.

1075
01:27:07,949 --> 01:27:09,075
So you’re married.

1076
01:27:11,286 --> 01:27:12,120
Yes.

1077
01:27:14,748 --> 01:27:15,582
He’s a doctor?

1078
01:27:18,001 --> 01:27:18,752
Yes.

1079
01:27:18,793 --> 01:27:20,170
His name is Pavel Scheftel.

1080
01:27:22,422 --> 01:27:23,256
Russian.

1081
01:27:26,134 --> 01:27:27,636
Yes, a Russian Jew.

1082
01:27:31,806 --> 01:27:32,766
What’s he like?

1083
01:27:35,477 --> 01:27:36,394
Kind.

1084
01:27:40,857 --> 01:27:43,735
Good, good.

1085
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:47,948
Are you all right?

1086
01:27:47,989 --> 01:27:49,241
Yes.

1087
01:27:51,618 --> 01:27:55,038
I haven’t been sleeping very well and
I keep having this apocalyptic dream.

1088
01:27:56,748 --> 01:27:59,417
A terrible flood from the
North Sea to the Alps.

1089
01:28:00,669 --> 01:28:02,003
Houses washed away.

1090
01:28:02,921 --> 01:28:04,714
Thousands of floating corpses.

1091
01:28:06,842 --> 01:28:10,720
Eventually it comes crashing into
the lake in a great tidal wave.

1092
01:28:12,389 --> 01:28:21,565
And by this time, the water, roaring down like
some vast avalanche, has turned to blood.

1093
01:28:23,859 --> 01:28:25,026
The blood of Europe.

1094
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:30,198
What do you think it means?

1095
01:28:33,493 --> 01:28:34,870
I’ve no idea.

1096
01:28:36,538 --> 01:28:37,914
Unless it’s about to happen.

1097
01:28:42,294 --> 01:28:43,295
What are your plans?

1098
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:47,424
We’ve been thinking of
going back to Russia.

1099
01:28:48,925 --> 01:28:50,260
As long as you leave Vienna.

1100
01:28:53,346 --> 01:28:54,890
I spoke to him last week.

1101
01:28:54,931 --> 01:28:56,266
I can’t believe there’s nothing to be done.

1102
01:28:56,308 --> 01:28:57,058
There’s nothing to be done.

1103
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,995
The day he refused to discuss a
dream with me on the grounds

1104
01:28:59,996 --> 01:29:02,606
that it might risk his authority,
I should have known.

1105
01:29:04,649 --> 01:29:06,776
After that, for me, he had no authority.

1106
01:29:08,737 --> 01:29:11,615
It was a blow when I discovered
you’d chosen his side.

1107
01:29:11,656 --> 01:29:13,617
It’s not a question of sides.

1108
01:29:14,451 --> 01:29:18,371
I have to work in the direction my instinct
tells my intelligence is the right one.

1109
01:29:18,413 --> 01:29:20,874
Don’t forget, you cured me with his method.

1110
01:29:22,918 --> 01:29:26,213
What he’ll never accept is that what
we understand has got us nowhere.

1111
01:29:27,255 --> 01:29:29,174
We have to go into uncharted territory.

1112
01:29:29,216 --> 01:29:32,761
We have to go back to the sources
of everything we believe.

1113
01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:35,407
I don’t want to just
open a door and show the

1114
01:29:35,408 --> 01:29:38,182
patient his illness squatting
there like a toad.

1115
01:29:38,183 --> 01:29:40,852
I want to try and find a way to
help the patient reinvent himself.

1116
01:29:40,894 --> 01:29:43,127
To send him off on a journey
at the end of which is

1117
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,232
waiting the person he was
always intended to be.

1118
01:29:45,273 --> 01:29:49,277
It’s no good making yourself
ill in the process.

1119
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:53,865
Only the wounded physician
can hope to heal.

1120
01:30:04,626 --> 01:30:06,211
I’m told you have a new mistress.

1121
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,881
Is that right?

1122
01:30:10,341 --> 01:30:11,550
What’s her name?

1123
01:30:12,634 --> 01:30:13,469
Toni.

1124
01:30:14,887 --> 01:30:16,055
Is she like me?

1125
01:30:16,096 --> 01:30:17,181
No.

1126
01:30:17,222 --> 01:30:18,557
She’s an ex-patient?

1127
01:30:19,892 --> 01:30:20,517
Yes.

1128
01:30:20,559 --> 01:30:21,185
Jewish?

1129
01:30:23,228 --> 01:30:24,313
Half Jewish.

1130
01:30:25,397 --> 01:30:26,774
Training to be an analyst?

1131
01:30:26,815 --> 01:30:27,608
Yes.

1132
01:30:28,942 --> 01:30:30,069
But she’s not like me?

1133
01:30:32,529 --> 01:30:34,073
Of course she makes me think of you.

1134
01:30:37,368 --> 01:30:38,702
How do you make it work?

1135
01:30:38,744 --> 01:30:40,371
I don’t know.

1136
01:30:42,915 --> 01:30:45,626
Emma, as you’ve seen, is the
foundation of my house.

1137
01:30:47,711 --> 01:30:49,505
Toni is the perfume in the air.

1138
01:30:56,762 --> 01:30:59,390
My love for you was the most
important thing in my life.

1139
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:05,270
For better or worse, made
me understand who I am.

1140
01:31:15,739 --> 01:31:17,241
<music> This should be mine.

1141
01:31:19,034 --> 01:31:19,868
Yes.

1142
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:29,294
Sometimes you have to do something
unforgivable just to be able to go on living.
