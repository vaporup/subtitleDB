1
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,412
Hi, honey.

2
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,925
Smells good.

3
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,891
- Can I have...
- Don't, don't!

4
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,029
Come in here and gather around!

5
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:53,839
- I must show you something!
- My new car?

6
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:55,451
Keep dreaming.

7
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:57,523
Here, eat these.

8
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:03,353
- They're chocolate chip.
- They're delicious.

9
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:04,629
They're 4 years old.

10
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,026
Anyone for milk?

11
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,570
8 years old.

12
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,627
It's my long-life food preservative.
It's been approved!

13
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,200
I got my big bonus!

14
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:22,583
- Congratulations.
- Isn't it great?

15
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:24,664
And...

16
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:26,103
...that's not all.

17
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,858
Mr. Shirley thinks a guy like...

18
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,198
...Clark Griswold deserves days off.

19
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,948
And Clark Griswold thinks he should
take those days off and...

20
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,237
...take his family on a fabulous
vacation to...

21
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,921
...fantastic Las Vegas!

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,522
There's nothing to do there.

23
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:51,057
Clark, I don't think that Las Vegas
is the kind of place you take a family.

24
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,148
Oh, come on.

25
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,546
Las Vegas has changed, Ellen.

26
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,529
It's the No 1 family
destination in America.

27
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:02,653
I'm not going.
The people there are so phony.

28
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,571
Is there legalized prostitution?

29
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:06,230
Not within the city limits.

30
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:08,091
But there is...

31
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,189
...first-class entertainment,
beautiful scenery...

32
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:15,198
...and all the shrimp cocktail
you can eat.

33
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,325
Listen, everybody...

34
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:22,170
...how many more chances will we get
to do something as a family?

35
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,721
Ellen and I are always working.

36
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:29,210
And you guys are growing up so fast
I hardly recognize you anymore.

37
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:34,974
Okay. There's one more reason
why you should all go.

38
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:40,479
I'm remarrying your mom...

39
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,330
...if she'll have me.

40
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,111
Really, Sparky?

41
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:49,273
What do you say? My 20th anniversary.
I could use a best man.

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,939
Have a bridesmaid in mind?

43
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,002
- How about Audrey?
- Audrey who?

44
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:55,201
Dad!

45
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,186
What do you say? Let's do it!

46
00:03:57,282 --> 00:04:00,629
I think this is going to be
the greatest vacation ever.

47
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:19,197
You know you look really
beautiful right now?

48
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,033
You know, honey...

49
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,127
...the guys at work tell me there's
this club we can join if we...

50
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:32,883
...meet in the bathroom.

51
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:37,218
Clark, are you serious?

52
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:39,165
You love me, don't you?

53
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,987
I do, but here?

54
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,099
Now?

55
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:44,919
We've been married 20 years.

56
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:47,873
How do we do it?

57
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:50,847
Go first, I'll be behind you.

58
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,438
Are you okay? You look red.

59
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,365
Just going to the restroom.

60
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,965
Excuse me.

61
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,557
Where're you going?

62
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:17,950
Your mother's got something in her eye.
I'm going to...

63
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,117
...help her get it out.

64
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,241
Maybe we should...

65
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,593
...join...

66
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,087
...some other kind of club.

67
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:11,869
I just want time with you.

68
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:15,005
I just think there's...

69
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,361
...a better time...
- This will be our best one.

70
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:21,728
Foot, foot!

71
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,962
I got it. I got it.

72
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,604
I'll never fly again.

73
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,369
The pilot was helpful.

74
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:32,124
The whole plane applauded.

75
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:34,685
You two use these bathrooms,
we'll wait.

76
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:36,123
Is this ours?

77
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,286
We're the Griswolds.

78
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,846
Sorry, my pen burst in the altitude.

79
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,515
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

80
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,203
Come this way, please.

81
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:48,284
This is it. This is it.

82
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,664
Look at this.

83
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:20,001
Wayne Newton.

84
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:48,582
It's beautiful!

85
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:53,118
You must see this.

86
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:01,768
Daddy!

87
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:03,303
Help!

88
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,809
I'm stuck!

89
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:09,442
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.

90
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,024
Look! I think you'll want to see this!

91
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:47,526
Is this it?

92
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:50,087
Welcome to the fabulous Mirage.

93
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,896
Don't worry,
it won't leave a permanent line.

94
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,416
Come on, there's a lot to do.

95
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,497
There's a lot to do.

96
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:09,766
Welcome. Your credit card.

97
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,822
Yes, indeed.

98
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:11,934
Griswold, four.

99
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:15,684
We have an excellent
dry-cleaning service.

100
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,545
It's a birthmark.

101
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:24,325
To get to your room,
go through the casino, veer to the left.

102
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:28,967
Take a right at the first palm tree.
You'll see a group of blackjack tables.

103
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,039
Not baccarat, not craps. Blackjack.

104
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,380
Turn right and wind around left.

105
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:35,854
If you get to the pool,
you've gone too far.

106
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:39,939
You'll see elevators.
They aren't yours, stay away from them.

107
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,210
Keep walking, you'll see
more elevators, the gold ones.

108
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:45,377
Those are yours. Go to the 10th floor.

109
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,892
You'll find your room.

110
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,086
Any questions?

111
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,059
No, not really.

112
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:55,208
Russ!

113
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:57,059
Did you get that?

114
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,799
Well, let's go then. Thanks.

115
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,383
Good luck!

116
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:17,871
What's this?

117
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:25,217
Look at these people. Blinded
by glitter and the mighty dollar.

118
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:50,211
The elevators are there.

119
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,975
Hold on, honey.

120
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:55,888
They always put the machines
that pay the most in front.

121
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:57,154
$5?

122
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,382
Here we go!

123
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:11,530
You see, Las Vegas is already
bringing us closer together.

124
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,025
Let's go to the room.

125
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,050
Honey, call up the kids.

126
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,064
See how they like this.

127
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,583
Rusty and Audrey Griswold, please.

128
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:40,908
We're right next door.
Can't we get our own rooms?

129
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,535
Please don't spoil your daddy's fun.

130
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,290
Dad, we're too old for this.

131
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:51,946
Sit down.

132
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,181
Kids...

133
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,329
...remember when you were babies?

134
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:00,271
It was a wonderful time.

135
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:03,148
We had your cribs right in our room.

136
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:05,766
We'd wrap you up in little blankets.

137
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:09,382
And roll you back and forth
across the bed into each other.

138
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,010
Those days...

139
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:13,938
...they're almost over.

140
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,352
So...

141
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,311
To close out that one chapter,
I got tickets to Siegfried and Roy.

142
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,267
Best show on the planet.

143
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,022
Masters of the impossible.

144
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:29,388
We're going because
we're the Griswolds!

145
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,525
Can't you just wrap me up in a blanket
and roll me across the bed?

146
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:35,143
No, Russ. Get dressed.

147
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:45,069
Want to try some blackjack?

148
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:48,330
What do you know
about blackjack, Clark?

149
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:50,738
You forget I was in the army.

150
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,710
You weren't in the army.

151
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,220
Not in the army, but I have
played cards with men in uniform.

152
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,392
Just don't want you to lose
all your money.

153
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:06,419
When a man can come to Las Vegas
with a few extra bucks in his pocket...

154
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:08,969
...throw a ten-spot down on a table...

155
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:11,856
...pay an extra dollar
for a steak with his eggs...

156
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,187
...that's a happy day for that man.

157
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,326
When his woman is at his side...

158
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:20,363
Is that Wayne Newton?

159
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,607
Why, you want his autograph?

160
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,774
I think he's staring at me.

161
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,851
No, no, no. I must be tired.

162
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,922
Maybe I'll go find the kids.

163
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:34,922
I think they want a little time
away from Mama and Papa Bear.

164
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,099
Let's let them get in trouble.

165
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,262
- I'm asking for five bucks!
- What if you win?

166
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,726
You're boring to travel with.

167
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,985
Fine, you want five bucks? Here, you're
a big man. Here's the five bucks.

168
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:49,423
Get a wallet.

169
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:54,218
- Hi.
- Good evening.

170
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,009
Would the two of you have any ID?

171
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:01,383
We left our IDs upstairs, actually.
We're on our honeymoon.

172
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,816
Wait here for 2 minutes.
I'll go upstairs and get the ID.

173
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,504
I'll be right back.

174
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:10,829
My friend...

175
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:12,105
...$200 in chips.

176
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:14,983
Good evening. Changing 200!

177
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:21,715
In blackjack, a smart player has
a mathematical advantage over the house.

178
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,909
Are you a professional?

179
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,153
Me? No, not really.

180
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,649
Are you?

181
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:38,422
Place your bet, sir.

182
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,014
Yes, the bet.

183
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:42,680
What the hell.

184
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,818
- Hit me.
- It's a bust!

185
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:51,465
Fun Police. Hand over your chips.

186
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:52,434
Eddie?

187
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:53,268
Twenty-two.

188
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,093
Player busts.

189
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:00,020
Oh, man, it is a blazer out there.

190
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:03,856
You're lucky you got air conditioning
in here like mother nature intended.

191
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:08,432
Clark Griswold, did you think
you could come to Las Vegas...

192
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,839
...and not see your favorite cousin?

193
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:11,701
Your bet.

194
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:13,064
There.

195
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:14,896
Why're you in Las Vegas?

196
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:18,578
Where else can you wear shorts
24 hours a day?

197
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:22,252
I am on fire!

198
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,383
What?

199
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,822
Shuffling!

200
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,836
Here's the best part.

201
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,975
Thanks to my defective plate...

202
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:32,495
...the VA gave me a huge plot of land
just north of town.

203
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,599
Every time I belch, the plate
shifts and my legs give out.

204
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:38,738
But what a view!

205
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,394
Nineteen.

206
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:43,475
Twenty!

207
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,548
Oh, he's good!

208
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:47,859
He's good!

209
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:53,392
- Another 100 in chips, please.
- Changing 100!

210
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:54,985
That's it, Clark.

211
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:56,433
Show them who's boss.

212
00:15:56,596 --> 00:16:00,500
It's people who blow the family
nest egg here that built this town.

213
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:02,360
Not this pretty boy.

214
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,824
Oh, gee!

215
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:15,317
I can't believe it.

216
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,731
I've lost $300 in 15 minutes?

217
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:26,739
I'm okay. I'm okay.

218
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,220
You're kind.

219
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,798
What a great audience.

220
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,284
Yeah, always.

221
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:27,382
Terrific!

222
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,626
Where do you come from?

223
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,793
Me? Chicago, Illinois.

224
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,242
- Fantastic.
- Chicago!

225
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:36,503
Why don't you come on stage?

226
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,941
Come on, it'll be fun.

227
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,638
- Go on!
- Yeah, Dad, do it!

228
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:42,199
Okay, I'll play along.

229
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,554
Applaud!

230
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,115
Good to have you.

231
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,742
What's your name?

232
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:53,814
Clark Griswold.

233
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,609
Marvelous!

234
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,854
Let's do some real magic.

235
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:59,348
Listen, I know the routine.

236
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,030
What's it going to be tonight?
Wires? Mirrors? Trap doors?

237
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:06,608
I happen to know a little magic myself.

238
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:08,699
I don't know if you've seen this.

239
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,371
Can you tell it's my thumb?

240
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:14,549
Looks like it is, but it's not.

241
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,493
Whatever, I'll do what you want.

242
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,028
I'm here to help.

243
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:21,972
Enter.

244
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:23,995
Okay, I know this one.

245
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,010
- Trust me.
- All right, I will.

246
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,055
Is this going up? I'll go with it.

247
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:32,762
Me.

248
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:32,445
Where's Dad?

249
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,679
I haven't got a clue.

250
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,581
It's my husband.

251
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,944
How'd you do at the tables?

252
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:13,081
I'm about even.

253
00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:17,876
Why'd you tell Eddie we were here?

254
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:22,365
Oh, come on. How often do I get
to see my cousin Catherine?

255
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:25,884
Anyway, we're just
stopping by for lunch.

256
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:27,803
I want to gamble.

257
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,747
Russell...

258
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,470
...I never want to hear
you say that again.

259
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,597
Gambling is a very serious business.

260
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,103
Is that clear?

261
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,443
Excuse me a minute.

262
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:03,385
Fifty on black.

263
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:04,602
No more bets.

264
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:08,515
Red 25! Red wins!

265
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:10,433
Jeez!

266
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,730
Shall we?

267
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,074
Remember me?

268
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:21,088
Yes.

269
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,308
Love you.

270
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:41,948
Your baby?

271
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,722
Are you watching for an address?

272
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:00,228
What block is this?

273
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,820
Very funny, Russ.

274
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:03,681
Will you check the map again?

275
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:05,273
Could that be it?

276
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,955
Eddie said there was room for a pool.

277
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:10,950
Get out the sunscreen.

278
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:20,800
Cousins!

279
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:22,469
What do you think?

280
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,370
Can you believe they tested H-bombs
on this beautiful property?

281
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:30,947
I missed you so much.

282
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:39,838
Don't you worry about radiation?

283
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,888
All I know is my teeth
have never been whiter...

284
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:45,122
...and my garden has 50-pound tomatoes.

285
00:23:47,145 --> 00:23:49,121
Denny-boy, come on over here!

286
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:51,040
Look at that view.

287
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:54,722
It's government property around us,
so no one will build.

288
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,024
Look at this one.

289
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:00,313
They grow up so fast.

290
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:03,268
I tell him he'll pierce
himself shut one day...

291
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:04,639
...but what can you do?

292
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,337
He likes eating through a straw.

293
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:08,965
They must make their own mistakes.

294
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:12,801
Does that hurt?

295
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:13,760
It's not bad.

296
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,457
Who's hungry?

297
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:19,783
Need help with the grill?

298
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,402
No, thanks. Don't have one.

299
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:31,426
I'll get the tongs.

300
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:39,367
Renewing your wedding vows?

301
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,082
Oh, that's so wonderful.

302
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,917
I wish Eddie and I had time
for that sort of thing.

303
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,574
But with the constant windstorms...

304
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:50,406
...and flash floods...

305
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,420
...oppressive heat and...

306
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:53,763
...home schooling...

307
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,355
...we don't have a minute free.

308
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,119
Can you hand me that mitt?

309
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,568
I love the kitchenette.

310
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,006
Oh, thanks.

311
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,104
Listen, things could be a lot worse.

312
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,214
Yeah, you could be pregnant again.

313
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:16,551
I've been...

314
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:19,303
...earning money
testing fertility drugs.

315
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:21,289
This one's going to be a winner.

316
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:24,482
Everyone loves a baby.

317
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,481
Yeah, life is good.

318
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,246
My kids are thriving.

319
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:33,440
Little Ruby Sue must have grown
a foot since you saw her last.

320
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:35,684
Daddy, I caught another snake.

321
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,161
That's good, sweetheart.

322
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:39,395
Put it in the pit with the others.

323
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,256
And go work on your typing.

324
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,531
Nice kids.

325
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:50,760
Don't ever pick me up again...

326
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,132
...jerk!

327
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:57,896
Look who's home!

328
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:01,089
This one here's my pride and joy.

329
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,249
Lord is my witness, I hate this heat!

330
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:10,210
If it ain't gluing your butt to a seat
it's making you sweat like an animal!

331
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:12,359
And I want something better!

332
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:15,016
Hey, everybody.

333
00:26:15,562 --> 00:26:17,470
You remember Vickie?

334
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,504
She's a dancer now.

335
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:20,933
Her picture's everywhere.

336
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,781
Phone booths, men's rooms...

337
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,096
She's famous.

338
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:28,299
Show them that little move
I taught you there.

339
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,858
Don't think unnatural thoughts
about your cousin.

340
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:52,035
She's got her mama's looks and
her daddy's sense of balance.

341
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,826
Hose down, kids!
Chicken's almost ready!

342
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,649
My chicken's dry as hell.

343
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,673
Mine's dry as hell, too.

344
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:01,924
If you want to be with me tonight,
I'll give you my beeper number.

345
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,225
Really? That'd be great.

346
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:08,167
If you're still hungry,
I can get the salad from the dog.

347
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:11,265
As appealing as that sounds,
we really must go.

348
00:27:11,438 --> 00:27:14,670
We have a lot of sightseeing to do
and I added tetanus shot to the list.

349
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:19,082
Sorry about the tablecloth. Rusty's
never had that reaction to poultry.

350
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,518
He ain't used to home cooking.

351
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:22,573
Are you?

352
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:25,316
He's sick.

353
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,629
Anyway...

354
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,547
He'll be okay.

355
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,341
I wish you two could come...

356
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:33,228
...but no room for the kids,
so thanks for lunch, and bye.

357
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:34,887
Not so fast, Clark.

358
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,585
I'll get the baby-sitter.

359
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:41,380
Hey, kids...

360
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,788
...round-up time!

361
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:50,089
They'll keep busy.

362
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,553
Where are we going?

363
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:55,171
Hoover Dam!

364
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:59,401
Over 1,000 feet wide and
727 feet to the bottom.

365
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:00,945
Where can I buy bait?

366
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:04,848
I love electricity.
Eddie says we'll get some soon.

367
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:07,495
What a magnificent achievement.

368
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:12,262
This is a family vacation.
Try to stay with the family.

369
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:13,413
Sorry, honey.

370
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:16,616
This way, please.
The tour is about to start.

371
00:28:18,927 --> 00:28:20,357
Welcome, everyone.

372
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,764
I am your dam guide, Arnie.

373
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:27,176
I'm about to take you through
a fully functioning power plant.

374
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:28,845
So please...

375
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,559
...no one wander off the dam tour.

376
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:34,915
Please, take all the dam pictures
you want.

377
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,256
Now, any dam questions?

378
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:39,826
Where can I get some dam bait?!

379
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,141
This way, please.

380
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,866
What'd he say?

381
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:48,525
This way.

382
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:53,646
Don't worry about water leaking
through the rocks. It's normal.

383
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:55,718
Please, keep up with the tour.

384
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,220
This is one of the oldest
dam tunnels we have.

385
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,220
Come here!

386
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:09,356
Give me your gum.

387
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:10,766
From my mouth?

388
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,480
Any gum! Look what's happening here!

389
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,244
- Here.
- I'll catch up.

390
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:40,947
Damn it.

391
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,984
Where is the damn dam tour?

392
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,847
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

393
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:32,143
And there are over 100 million tons
of cement in these walls.

394
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:38,291
Hello. Hello.

395
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:40,046
Help!

396
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:01,971
It's not that high.

397
00:31:13,978 --> 00:31:15,503
Okay, here we go.

398
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:17,162
Let's see if I've still got it.

399
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,469
Nice breeze up here.

400
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,428
That's how a power plant works.

401
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:35,019
How?

402
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,606
This tour gets better every week.

403
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,207
Fishing's been better.

404
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,288
Remember when I had that puffer fish?

405
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,446
Just like in gym.

406
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,211
One hand at a time.

407
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:27,251
Ellen!

408
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:29,006
What's that?

409
00:32:29,178 --> 00:32:32,525
"Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies

410
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:35,576
"For amber waves of..."

411
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,208
Oh, my God!

412
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,303
Sorry, honey, I'll be right up.

413
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:50,230
This is steep.

414
00:32:50,614 --> 00:32:51,669
Here we go.

415
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:06,650
Need help?

416
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:07,992
No, I got it.

417
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,063
That's a workout there, isn't it?
Climbed all the way up.

418
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:17,650
I almost lost my tag.

419
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:20,470
Drinks at the snacketeria, on me.

420
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:49,932
I've noticed you're taking more
of an interest in the fairer sex.

421
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,462
There's something your
old dad would like to say.

422
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:55,409
You see...

423
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:57,749
...there comes a time...

424
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:00,473
...in every young man's
life when he enters...

425
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:03,503
...the fragrant garden
of beautiful flowers.

426
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:07,254
And he wants to enter that garden
with a knowledge and...

427
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,701
...a mulch...

428
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:12,855
...to let the flowers bloom
more brightly, rather than...

429
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,389
Dad.

430
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,185
What?

431
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,756
If this is about sex, I already know.

432
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,251
You do?

433
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:26,934
Good talk, son.

434
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:31,470
So what's it going to be tonight?
"The Amazing Elvis"?

435
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:33,235
"Liberace on Ice"?

436
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:36,601
Clark, I don't know.
It's been such a long day.

437
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:42,144
At Hoover Dam the water level
dropped four feet from a flood.

438
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:43,737
Thank you.

439
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:48,273
Look at this.

440
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,364
Four tickets to Wayne Newton.

441
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:52,599
Wayne Newton?!

442
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:55,897
Wayne Newton?

443
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,842
That's Las Vegas,
they never stop giving!

444
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:00,760
Hi, for Ellen Griswold?

445
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:03,101
I'm Mr. Ellen Griswold.

446
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,441
"Please wear this tonight.

447
00:35:16,604 --> 00:35:18,033
"A friend."

448
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,536
Who's it from?

449
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:23,317
I don't know.

450
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:25,878
But it's beautiful.

451
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:31,642
They really know how to treat
their high rollers around here.

452
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:33,080
Okay, kids...

453
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:34,999
...inspection in five minutes.

454
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:37,493
You heard him! Move it!

455
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:45,692
Wayne Newton just happens to be
one of America's greatest entertainers.

456
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:48,158
He has an effect on women.

457
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,035
Yes, Griswold, Griswold.
Right this way, sir.

458
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,554
Here...

459
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,952
...make the seats good.

460
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:03,991
No gratuity is necessary, sir.

461
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,399
- No, really. Keep it.
- Follow me.

462
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:10,974
We're in the front row.

463
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,316
I tipped him.

464
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,656
"A man knows a moment

465
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:16,728
"One wonderful moment

466
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:19,510
"When fate takes his hand"

467
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,550
What energy!

468
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,753
"My once in a lifetime"

469
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:28,726
Thank you.

470
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:31,134
You're a magical group of people.

471
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:33,052
And, Greg...

472
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:35,765
Give me some birds. Let me hear birds.

473
00:36:46,018 --> 00:36:48,636
"Yes, loving you

474
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:53,432
"Is easy 'cause you're beautiful

475
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,961
"Making love to you

476
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,308
"Is all I want

477
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:02,553
"To do

478
00:37:03,684 --> 00:37:05,056
"Yes, loving you

479
00:37:07,943 --> 00:37:10,973
"Has made my life so beautiful

480
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,601
"And every time that we

481
00:37:18,243 --> 00:37:20,794
"I'm full of loving...?"

482
00:37:21,063 --> 00:37:22,654
Mrs. Ellen Griswold.

483
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:24,736
Ellen, huh?

484
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:29,062
Holy crap,
Wayne Newton's hitting on Mom.

485
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:31,296
It's all part of the act.

486
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:32,955
Now you.

487
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:48,732
"No one else"

488
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:51,034
I think we know who sent the dress.

489
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:53,594
"The colors that you bring"

490
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:54,879
You're lucky.

491
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:58,016
I've been to every Wayne show
for the last 15 years.

492
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,893
I've never seen him do
anything like this.

493
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:05,055
"Each day in springtime"

494
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:11,932
I'm just saying I've never heard you
hit those notes before.

495
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,275
Don't worry.

496
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:16,411
You have nothing to fear
from Wayne Newton. He's...

497
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:17,859
...unattainable.

498
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:19,672
Did you see him staring at...

499
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:20,957
Watch your mouth.

500
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,777
I think I'll go upstairs
and take a bath.

501
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,956
Not me.

502
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,297
Anyone for craps?

503
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:28,802
We're too young.

504
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,050
I was once too young.

505
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:34,652
Here.

506
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:36,801
Take 20 bucks.

507
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:38,172
If you need me...

508
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:40,963
...l'll be rolling the dice.

509
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:42,814
Have fun, kids.

510
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:45,221
- Have a nice night.
- See you later.

511
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:51,129
Daddy wants a seven! Let's go, seven!

512
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:53,604
Seven! A winner!

513
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:56,481
Place your bets.
Lucky roller coming out.

514
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:57,757
Place your bets.

515
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:03,972
Let go of me! Let go of me!

516
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,139
There he is. Clark!

517
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:08,066
See, I told you.

518
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:10,560
Look out, don't hurt me now.

519
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,957
Nice place for a pearl necklace.

520
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,655
Do you know this person?

521
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:17,063
Hi, Clark Griswold. Nice to meet you.

522
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:20,573
Have you ever swam with dolphins?

523
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:23,105
Them things is hard to catch.

524
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:25,886
Twelve. Craps. A loser.

525
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:28,255
Has anyone ever told you before...

526
00:39:29,128 --> 00:39:30,173
...you're bad luck?

527
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,568
Those were my mother's dying words.

528
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:37,030
But when you got your body
covered in third-degree burns...

529
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:39,975
...and your foot's in a bear trap,
you start talking crazy.

530
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,671
I've run out of money.
Do you cash checks?

531
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,906
Only if you're staying at the hotel.

532
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:53,248
Indeed I am.

533
00:39:54,313 --> 00:39:55,972
Here we are.

534
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:03,261
No problem.

535
00:40:10,857 --> 00:40:12,065
Good luck.

536
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:14,310
Look, Clark, if you're...

537
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:17,571
...thinking about buying me
a Cadillac, forget it.

538
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:18,530
I won't take it.

539
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:20,160
I'm just trying to get even.

540
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:22,816
Now where can I do the most damage?

541
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,900
"Come fly with me

542
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:29,185
"Let's fly"

543
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:31,179
Shrimp cocktail, 29 cents.

544
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,364
"If you can use some exotic boo"

545
00:40:34,853 --> 00:40:36,551
Fake IDs.

546
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:37,826
How'd you know?

547
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:41,413
When I was your age I needed
a water cannon to keep me away...

548
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:43,264
...from the girls.

549
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:45,259
Ten bucks. Ten! Ten!

550
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:46,698
Shrimp, ladies.

551
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,289
I need the ten.

552
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:50,793
Here.

553
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:53,248
Have a good evening, Mr. Morris.

554
00:40:53,737 --> 00:40:55,262
"That's why..."

555
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:56,068
Whatever.

556
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:58,696
- Another 21!
- You nailed her there.

557
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:02,081
Let's see. House has 14,
and house busts.

558
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:04,066
Oh, boy!

559
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,888
Wendy, you are my lucky charm.

560
00:41:06,157 --> 00:41:08,545
I don't know what's wrong
with me tonight.

561
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:10,952
You're rolling.

562
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,033
Good luck, everybody.

563
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:17,033
Good luck, everybody!

564
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:19,105
Batter up.

565
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:24,447
Big bet for a big man!

566
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:27,813
Sure you don't want to save money
for the buffet?

567
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:28,772
Okay, wise guy.

568
00:41:28,935 --> 00:41:30,536
Go against three hands.

569
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:35,006
This should be sweet.

570
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:37,413
Sweet for me. You're finished.

571
00:41:41,997 --> 00:41:43,177
Straw.

572
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:45,988
I'm trying to concentrate.

573
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:51,416
That's a bigger fire
than the red drink.

574
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:01,563
Did you come to Las Vegas
to be a showgirl?

575
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:04,382
No, I'm on vacation with my parents.

576
00:42:06,972 --> 00:42:09,590
Hard to believe we're related, right?

577
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,725
A drink, please.

578
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:22,873
Welcome. Can I see some ID?

579
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,365
I think we have a problem.

580
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:39,830
Good night.

581
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,812
Hey, why the long face?

582
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:49,689
You know that crap ID you sold me?
I want my ten bucks back.

583
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:51,617
Those bums threw you out?

584
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:55,127
Helicopter rides to the Grand Canyon.
See it as God does.

585
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,412
They tossed me.

586
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,411
Don't they realize
what it's like to be:

587
00:43:00,575 --> 00:43:03,126
"A boy on the town when he's in love"

588
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:04,478
Give me my money.

589
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:06,876
I'm not through with you yet. Okay?

590
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:11,508
You're Nick Pappagiorgio. You're from
Yuma, Arizona. You're into software.

591
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:14,165
Put your head in the hole
and say "Joey Heatherton."

592
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,726
- Right here on the strip?
- Smile, kid.

593
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:17,848
You're in Vegas!

594
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:40,606
So you guys have been together
longer than the real Beatles?

595
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:41,719
Great.

596
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,167
Will you excuse me?

597
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:52,125
You want to dance up here?

598
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:53,985
No, I don't think so.

599
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,178
Audrey, honey, let me tell you
something I learned.

600
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:01,025
In this world, you're either
up on stage in the spotlight...

601
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:03,259
...or down in the pit serving drinks.

602
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:04,765
Go have fun.

603
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:32,770
What are you doing up there?

604
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:35,810
I'm starting my vacation!

605
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,411
She's going to break hearts.

606
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:43,646
She's going to break something.

607
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:22,047
Congratulations.

608
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,323
You won the car.

609
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,826
May I see some ID?

610
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,947
Where would you like the car sent,
Mr. Pappagiorgio?

611
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,370
Eighteen.

612
00:45:44,068 --> 00:45:45,017
Nineteen.

613
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,369
So close.

614
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:51,587
I've had enough.
Let's get out of here.

615
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:53,889
Good luck, sir.

616
00:45:55,011 --> 00:45:58,847
Never seen such a beating since
someone stuck a banana in my pants...

617
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,064
...and turned a monkey loose.

618
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:01,887
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

619
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,023
Why don't you just call it a night
and let Ellen lick your wounds?

620
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:08,456
That sounds great,
but Ellen went to sleep hours ago.

621
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,104
She must be one hell of a sleepwalker.

622
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:15,113
Did you record that in Germany?

623
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:17,568
Good night, Eddie.

624
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:20,896
That's how they got the title
"Danke Schön."

625
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:22,239
It means "thank you."

626
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:23,993
"Thank you" in German.

627
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,921
I thought you went to bed.

628
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:32,098
It got late. I got worried.

629
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:33,757
Clark, Wayne Newton.

630
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:35,292
Nice to meet you.

631
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:38,015
You're in food preservatives?
What a gas.

632
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:41,535
I like it.

633
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,050
As I was saying...

634
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:45,218
You've traveled.
We never go anywhere.

635
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:49,610
We're very boring. Usually Clark falls
asleep in front of the TV each night.

636
00:46:49,764 --> 00:46:52,737
I guess I'll go upstairs
and get some sleep.

637
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,967
Let me just tip the piano player.
She was marvelous.

638
00:46:57,197 --> 00:47:00,131
I might have... l've got a chip here.

639
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,217
Danke Schön.

640
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:06,308
Thanks.

641
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,679
Sit down.

642
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:12,158
Very special lady.

643
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:16,254
That's why I entered into the sacred
bond of marriage with her.

644
00:47:16,973 --> 00:47:18,249
I hear that.

645
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,289
You know, I love women.

646
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:23,457
I observe them.

647
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:25,221
I cherish them.

648
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:29,249
Don't let that one out of your sight.

649
00:47:38,216 --> 00:47:42,149
Wayne has invited us to Shenandoah
tomorrow for lunch.

650
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:43,261
That's my home.

651
00:47:43,434 --> 00:47:44,383
Thank you.

652
00:47:44,556 --> 00:47:46,148
But we have a lot of plans.

653
00:47:46,311 --> 00:47:46,944
Don't we?

654
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:52,555
Oh, my God!

655
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:54,856
It's Wayne Newton!

656
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,213
I'm a fan, sir.

657
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,325
I'm a fan.

658
00:47:59,498 --> 00:48:00,927
I can believe it!

659
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,008
Take my seat, Eddie.

660
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:06,375
Thank you for the drink.

661
00:48:06,538 --> 00:48:07,909
Good night, Wayne.

662
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:16,225
Do you need a bodyguard?

663
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:17,740
I'd die for you.

664
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:27,589
Could I play $5 in coins, please?

665
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:29,709
I'd like to bet $5.

666
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:30,975
$5.

667
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:32,097
New roller.

668
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,341
Looks like a shooter.
I'm going for it.

669
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:37,065
- Go for this. Go for this.
- I'm ready.

670
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:38,091
Come on!

671
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:40,326
Seven, now!

672
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:41,707
Seven! A winner.

673
00:48:42,858 --> 00:48:43,807
Way to go!

674
00:48:45,899 --> 00:48:46,531
Press it?

675
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,912
Press it?

676
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:49,351
I want to press this up.

677
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:50,310
Press it?

678
00:48:50,473 --> 00:48:51,749
Yeah, press it.

679
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:53,993
Give him the dice. Come on.

680
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,253
Seven, dice!

681
00:48:58,318 --> 00:48:59,335
Winner.

682
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:00,553
Fantastic!

683
00:49:00,716 --> 00:49:01,829
He's great!

684
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:05,349
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
May I see some ID?

685
00:49:06,317 --> 00:49:07,909
ID? Sure.

686
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:11,265
Thank you.

687
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:18,372
Welcome to the Mirage, Mr. Pappagiorgio.

688
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:21,096
Why do they do that
when we got a hot table?

689
00:49:22,218 --> 00:49:23,331
How's Yuma?

690
00:49:23,504 --> 00:49:24,395
It's great.

691
00:49:24,558 --> 00:49:28,778
My wife and kids are back in Yuma,
where I work in software...

692
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:30,371
In the software business.

693
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:32,394
Let him roll the dice.

694
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:35,818
No glasses tonight?

695
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:39,012
No, I do not require them.

696
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:41,573
Good luck, sir.

697
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,613
But you do.

698
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:46,157
- Come on!
- Seven!

699
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,830
Seven again! Seven again!
I can't believe it!

700
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:55,278
Don't wake them.

701
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:06,480
Forget craps, forget blackjack.
If you want to make money...

702
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:11,342
...walk up to a baccarat table and say,
"I want to play baccarat."

703
00:50:12,627 --> 00:50:14,631
Feeling lucky tonight, Sparky?

704
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:18,219
Not right now, honey.
They're teaching me baccarat.

705
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:20,770
Bet with the player.

706
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:25,354
That's not exactly what I had in mind.

707
00:50:25,517 --> 00:50:28,720
Bet with the bank.
Bet with the player.

708
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:30,955
Nine is a natural.

709
00:50:31,118 --> 00:50:32,461
Bet with the bank.

710
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:35,588
Bet with the player.
Nine is a natural.

711
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:38,954
Bet with the bank.

712
00:50:39,117 --> 00:50:40,459
Bet with the player.

713
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:41,898
Nine is a natural.

714
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:44,555
Bet with the bank.

715
00:50:44,718 --> 00:50:46,060
Eight is a winner.

716
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,295
Give me that.

717
00:50:48,468 --> 00:50:51,018
We shouldn't be doing this
before we get married?

718
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,018
Hard six coming out.

719
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:57,262
Hit me.

720
00:50:58,548 --> 00:50:59,756
Good night.

721
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:05,415
Do it again!

722
00:51:05,587 --> 00:51:06,862
Do it again!

723
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:08,397
I'm coming out. Ready?

724
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:11,150
Seven out.

725
00:51:11,763 --> 00:51:12,943
God!

726
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:15,974
Nice roll.

727
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,422
You did good.

728
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,340
Thank you.

729
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,038
Cash me in.

730
00:51:23,762 --> 00:51:26,629
Kid, you made me
a lot of money tonight.

731
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:28,144
Jilly from Philly.

732
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:29,995
Nick Pappagiorgio from Yuma.

733
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,940
Nick Pappagiorgio from Yuma,
you like getting massaged?

734
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:34,216
By who?

735
00:51:34,388 --> 00:51:35,433
By me!

736
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:37,994
Meet us in the spa at 10:00
tomorrow morning.

737
00:51:38,157 --> 00:51:40,948
Randy, this guy is with us.
You take care of him.

738
00:51:41,102 --> 00:51:44,717
We're so impressed with your play
we'd like you to stay here.

739
00:51:44,881 --> 00:51:45,743
Follow me.

740
00:51:49,043 --> 00:51:52,936
And if there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to call me.

741
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:54,634
Thank you!

742
00:52:25,362 --> 00:52:26,821
Oh, my God!

743
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,925
Card counting, Clark?

744
00:52:35,471 --> 00:52:36,527
Is that legal?

745
00:52:37,015 --> 00:52:38,445
Sharpens the player's edge.

746
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:42,128
Here's the kids.

747
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:45,139
What happened to you last night?

748
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:49,032
What are you having for breakfast?

749
00:52:49,205 --> 00:52:49,934
Coffee.

750
00:52:50,098 --> 00:52:50,893
Three.

751
00:52:51,056 --> 00:52:51,852
Four.

752
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:52,648
Gang!

753
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,318
Don't shout, Daddy.

754
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,163
I had an idea.
How about an "alone" day...

755
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:02,153
...where each of us Griswolds
goes out and explores Las Vegas...

756
00:53:02,325 --> 00:53:03,438
...in their own way?

757
00:53:04,176 --> 00:53:06,152
I don't think that's a good idea.

758
00:53:06,325 --> 00:53:07,533
- Great.
- Love you.

759
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:09,192
Be back at 5:00.

760
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:12,338
You'll have a great time.

761
00:53:12,502 --> 00:53:13,451
Have fun.

762
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:46,826
Payback time.

763
00:53:52,217 --> 00:53:54,039
$500.

764
00:53:54,778 --> 00:53:56,686
You don't know when to quit.

765
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:57,779
Chips.

766
00:53:58,038 --> 00:53:59,889
Changing 500!

767
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:05,385
Here's an idea.

768
00:54:05,557 --> 00:54:09,652
You give me half the money
you're going to bet, we go out back...

769
00:54:09,815 --> 00:54:12,596
...l'll kick you in the nuts
and we'll call it a day?

770
00:54:19,895 --> 00:54:21,324
Pappagiorgio...

771
00:54:21,497 --> 00:54:22,772
...enjoying the massage?

772
00:54:23,003 --> 00:54:25,170
I'm enjoying it, Jilly. Really.

773
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:28,431
You know what your problem is?
You're a nervous guy.

774
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:31,145
You must learn how to relax.

775
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:33,390
You're right, Jilly, I do.

776
00:54:33,878 --> 00:54:35,471
Harder on the shoulders.

777
00:54:35,644 --> 00:54:37,398
That's it, kid.

778
00:54:37,562 --> 00:54:40,909
Now that you got that,
we must teach you how to dress.

779
00:54:46,298 --> 00:54:48,917
Now aren't you a little slice of pie?

780
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,835
Are you thinking of dancing?

781
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:53,396
She's got a body for it.

782
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:54,930
I do? Thanks.

783
00:54:55,094 --> 00:54:57,817
If you're thinking about it,
do it while you're young and foolish.

784
00:54:57,884 --> 00:55:01,395
I'm going to college but hoping to do
volunteer work in the summer.

785
00:55:01,557 --> 00:55:03,735
Our prime years are few and fast.

786
00:55:03,898 --> 00:55:05,489
Would've, could've, should've.

787
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,019
Show this girl something with a heel.

788
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:13,335
Hit me!

789
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,212
Yeah! Twenty!

790
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:21,228
It's 20. It's a push.

791
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,676
I didn't lose.

792
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,934
That's it, Griswold,
you are freaking dead!

793
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:29,486
I love you, kid.

794
00:56:01,087 --> 00:56:03,322
Outrageous. Where's the family?

795
00:56:03,897 --> 00:56:05,173
They're busy.

796
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:09,239
Did I come at a bad time? Because...

797
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:10,677
...I could just...

798
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,099
A singer's body is his instrument and
I believe in keeping it finely tuned.

799
00:56:15,895 --> 00:56:18,034
Come in, let's have some fun.

800
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:24,536
Blackjack.

801
00:56:24,699 --> 00:56:25,975
Blackjack.

802
00:56:26,685 --> 00:56:28,056
Six.

803
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:45,971
They're not bad.

804
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:51,160
The boys aren't much to talk to, but if
you need a night away from your cat...

805
00:56:51,323 --> 00:56:53,328
...they're more than fine.

806
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,959
What did you say?

807
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:34,836
I said, "Blackjack!"

808
00:57:41,406 --> 00:57:43,411
Changing 1,600!

809
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,582
Lunch was wonderful.

810
00:57:47,746 --> 00:57:49,885
I hope you enjoyed the company
as much as the food.

811
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:54,296
Please, madam, chin up.

812
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:56,857
You know...

813
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,434
...l've always felt very blessed
by all the gifts I've been given.

814
00:58:01,824 --> 00:58:04,759
But after meeting you
I realize how truly alone I am.

815
00:58:05,824 --> 00:58:08,691
But, Wayne, you have millions of fans.

816
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,197
Please.

817
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,895
They just love my talent.

818
00:58:12,384 --> 00:58:15,098
I feel so many things right now.

819
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,237
I wish I could spend my life with you.

820
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:20,536
Well...

821
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:25,236
...we could turn the den into a guest
room, but what about your horses?

822
00:58:25,408 --> 00:58:28,707
Clark pretty much likes the garage
for the car and the lawn mowers.

823
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:36,438
You're too much.

824
00:58:37,502 --> 00:58:39,257
I have something for you.

825
00:58:49,347 --> 00:58:50,776
It's a lock of my hair.

826
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,938
Gosh!

827
00:58:56,386 --> 00:58:58,208
It's getting late!

828
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:00,539
I've got to go!

829
00:59:00,702 --> 00:59:02,198
But thank you.

830
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:04,759
- It's been wonderful.
- Wait.

831
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,017
If you have nothing to do later,
please come back!

832
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,839
I'm making pasta!

833
00:59:15,645 --> 00:59:18,780
Come on, you think this sign's here
to hold down the table?

834
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:23,010
What can I do with $5?

835
00:59:23,653 --> 00:59:25,024
I don't know.

836
00:59:25,408 --> 00:59:27,959
Buy a bullet and rent a gun?

837
00:59:34,173 --> 00:59:35,229
See you.

838
00:59:35,392 --> 00:59:36,341
Have a good time.

839
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:46,968
Good luck, sir.

840
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:51,447
I had a fantastic "alone" day.
It was a great idea.

841
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:53,701
Where'd you get that stuff?

842
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:55,715
At the men's store.

843
00:59:57,479 --> 00:59:58,102
My God!

844
00:59:58,275 --> 01:00:00,031
Vickie took me to her stylist.

845
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:04,509
Did you know there were 92 muscles
in the human throat?

846
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:08,288
All this time I thought I was
unhappy with you and Mom.

847
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:12,508
But I was dissatisfied with myself.
That's changed, thanks to Las Vegas!

848
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:16,507
This is Larry, Kurt and Ira.
They're professional entertainers.

849
01:00:16,737 --> 01:00:17,534
Nice to meet you.

850
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:19,461
You know what drives me crazy?

851
01:00:19,615 --> 01:00:21,044
The baccarat tables.

852
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:24,352
Larry can bend his leg up
over his head. Want to see?

853
01:00:24,516 --> 01:00:25,311
You should.

854
01:00:25,475 --> 01:00:26,270
It's after-riding wear.

855
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:29,627
If those guys weren't bust-outs,
you think they'd be home writing?

856
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,229
Come with me!

857
01:00:31,392 --> 01:00:32,342
Not you!

858
01:00:39,362 --> 01:00:42,527
I know we haven't seen a lot
of each other lately and that's okay...

859
01:00:42,594 --> 01:00:44,023
...but we're Griswolds.

860
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:45,788
We're on vacation.

861
01:00:45,961 --> 01:00:48,896
And starting now, we're going
to have a great time.

862
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:51,130
But, Dad, we're having a great time.

863
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:53,690
My sister has the legs
of a thoroughbred.

864
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:54,755
Am I right?

865
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:55,868
Shut up.

866
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:58,428
The point is, starting now...

867
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:00,903
...we'll have a great time together!

868
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:02,006
How?

869
01:01:02,984 --> 01:01:04,096
How?

870
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,372
Well...

871
01:01:05,573 --> 01:01:06,685
How?

872
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:11,318
We could all...

873
01:01:11,491 --> 01:01:13,879
...sit on a bench, as a family...

874
01:01:14,052 --> 01:01:17,562
...and watch a Vegas sunset.
Wouldn't that be great?

875
01:01:22,473 --> 01:01:25,820
We could count the bulbs
on the strip, Audrey.

876
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:29,311
Larry's taking me to see
the world's largest thermometer.

877
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,856
I got a thing happening downtown.

878
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:37,146
I mean, you know...

879
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,620
I know.

880
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,389
We can get remarried. Right now.

881
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:51,456
There's a honeymoon slots tournament
over at the Golden Nugget. And guess?

882
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:54,006
Newlyweds get in for free.

883
01:01:54,659 --> 01:01:56,672
I've got news for you, Clark.

884
01:01:56,903 --> 01:01:58,591
I haven't said "yes" yet.

885
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:03,876
If you're too busy...

886
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:05,861
You hang on a minute!

887
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:08,191
You brought us on a family vacation...

888
01:02:08,354 --> 01:02:12,037
...and we only see you on your way
in or out of the casino!

889
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,150
I've invited you...

890
01:02:13,322 --> 01:02:15,624
You find the Clark Griswold
I married...

891
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:18,271
...and tell him I'm at the Mirage!

892
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:19,134
Come on.

893
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:25,636
Don't worry about me! I got plenty
I can do on my own in Las Vegas!

894
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:35,899
Which hand is it in?

895
01:02:38,182 --> 01:02:40,416
Who wants it now? Who wants it?

896
01:02:40,617 --> 01:02:42,468
There you go, you heathens!

897
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,058
Thanks for buying me dinner.

898
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:47,945
Best $1.49 in town, Clark.

899
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:50,822
Clark, this is all you can eat.

900
01:02:50,985 --> 01:02:52,740
We only need one plate.

901
01:03:02,148 --> 01:03:03,577
I need rolls.

902
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,343
I had that last time.

903
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:06,627
Fresh broccoli.

904
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:09,256
Bless you.

905
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:10,531
Thank you.

906
01:03:10,694 --> 01:03:13,735
Maybe I'll just replace these
and take a carrot.

907
01:03:13,897 --> 01:03:15,489
The best macaroni.

908
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:18,309
- That's good.
- No, let's get a little more.

909
01:03:20,141 --> 01:03:22,212
Some of this spaghetti bolognese here.

910
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:25,339
You're lucky you came on Italian night.

911
01:03:26,374 --> 01:03:27,171
That stuff...

912
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,568
...will knock your socks off.

913
01:03:29,741 --> 01:03:31,650
This doesn't look like chicken.

914
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,568
Oh, you're right.

915
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:36,388
This isn't chicken. This is chicken.

916
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:37,663
Want some?

917
01:03:38,632 --> 01:03:41,567
Eddie, I think I'll just be over
by the Saltines.

918
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,974
- Here, go ahead.
- Go get us a table.

919
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:48,069
We'll have some...

920
01:03:48,232 --> 01:03:49,575
...of the yellow.

921
01:03:50,697 --> 01:03:53,037
And don't get cheap on me.

922
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,174
This bread pudding's
extra runny tonight.

923
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:06,531
Eddie, when you look at me,
what do you see?

924
01:04:13,676 --> 01:04:15,268
Time's up, Eddie.

925
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:17,857
I'll tell you what you see.

926
01:04:18,127 --> 01:04:19,335
You see a man...

927
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:23,180
...whose family counted on him
to give them the best vacation ever.

928
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,990
And I can't do it. Because...

929
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:29,578
You have something on your...

930
01:04:32,455 --> 01:04:33,193
Off?

931
01:04:33,423 --> 01:04:34,795
You got it.

932
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:38,880
I've gambled away more money
than you'll ever understand.

933
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:40,808
Try me.

934
01:04:46,064 --> 01:04:47,915
$22,600.

935
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:48,711
God!

936
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:50,629
Oh, God!

937
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:52,136
Oh, God!

938
01:04:52,558 --> 01:04:54,053
Oh, God!

939
01:04:55,981 --> 01:04:57,257
- Oh, God!
- Please!

940
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:04,555
I don't know what to tell Ellen.

941
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:09,964
If I could just get that money back,
I could turn it all around.

942
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,948
You've been so good to Catherine
and me through the years.

943
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,704
I hate to see you down.

944
01:05:18,443 --> 01:05:19,939
I've got some...

945
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:34,276
...money stashed away and...

946
01:05:34,929 --> 01:05:38,918
...it'd be my honor to help you
in your time of need.

947
01:05:39,955 --> 01:05:41,163
You mean it?

948
01:05:42,285 --> 01:05:43,944
There's just one problem.

949
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,138
I forgot where I buried it.

950
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,464
Is it safe to be digging like this?

951
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:54,504
Just watch out for the scorpions.

952
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:05,542
I got money buried all over this yard.

953
01:06:07,307 --> 01:06:10,127
I used to have quite a little system
for finding it.

954
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:12,045
Wait, here's something.

955
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:15,747
$28!

956
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:19,277
Got one.

957
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,782
Got one. Got one.

958
01:06:25,424 --> 01:06:26,373
Six bucks.

959
01:06:26,546 --> 01:06:30,315
Yuban coffee. You can sprinkle
that stuff on anything.

960
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:34,699
Ice cream, mashed potatoes, or eat it
right out of the can for a pick-me-up.

961
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:38,534
Oh, my God.

962
01:06:39,024 --> 01:06:41,259
There must be over $100 in here.

963
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:45,028
Yeah, that's from when I sold
one of my kidneys.

964
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,655
We didn't need the cash
at the time but...

965
01:06:47,828 --> 01:06:50,475
...I figured with all the advances
in modern medicine...

966
01:06:50,638 --> 01:06:53,736
...I should sell it while somebody
still wanted to buy it.

967
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:55,596
The smartest thing I ever did.

968
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:59,337
Why do you have all this money
buried in the ground?

969
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:02,310
For a rainy day.

970
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,417
We don't get many of those
in the desert.

971
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,977
Where's the nearest casino?

972
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,318
Hello, room service.

973
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,715
I'd like the Crab Rangoon...

974
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,634
...chicken fingers...

975
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,945
...the Jackpot Burger...

976
01:07:21,903 --> 01:07:24,292
...and the Tropical Banana Torte.

977
01:07:26,862 --> 01:07:27,812
No.

978
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:29,672
Cancel that.

979
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:31,427
I'm going out.

980
01:07:31,926 --> 01:07:33,356
I must warn you.

981
01:07:33,518 --> 01:07:37,834
They don't play the same games
here as at them regular casinos.

982
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:42,533
Eddie, this place is great.

983
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,941
They don't play this at the Mirage.

984
01:07:45,746 --> 01:07:47,914
Pick a number? I'm great at that.

985
01:07:48,471 --> 01:07:49,842
Coin toss?

986
01:07:50,005 --> 01:07:51,281
These are my games.

987
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:52,719
Give me 20 bucks.

988
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:53,899
War!

989
01:07:54,062 --> 01:07:56,555
Russ and I play this all the time.

990
01:07:57,265 --> 01:07:58,156
I'm in.

991
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,500
Here we go.

992
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:00,939
Mine.

993
01:08:01,427 --> 01:08:02,952
That's fast.

994
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,401
Give me another 20.

995
01:08:07,345 --> 01:08:08,236
War, bet again.

996
01:08:12,629 --> 01:08:13,837
Mine again.

997
01:08:14,164 --> 01:08:16,618
Maybe you should spread it around...

998
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:19,026
...not have all your fun at one table.

999
01:08:24,148 --> 01:08:26,315
Dealer has rock. Pay paper.

1000
01:08:29,423 --> 01:08:30,055
Call it.

1001
01:08:30,487 --> 01:08:33,748
What say we go home and
bury what's left of my money?

1002
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:34,803
Heads.

1003
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,680
I'm sorry, it's tails.

1004
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:39,598
Almost.

1005
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:52,776
No, give me that! Give me that!

1006
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:55,816
He cheated, Eddie!
He switched them, I saw it!

1007
01:09:10,576 --> 01:09:11,209
Four.

1008
01:09:11,286 --> 01:09:12,178
Seven.

1009
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,782
What am I doing?

1010
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:20,561
I need to go someplace
where a man can think.

1011
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,958
I wouldn't do that here.

1012
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:26,545
These stalls are awfully dirty
and they're backed up.

1013
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:29,518
I need to be alone.

1014
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:33,105
I see.

1015
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:34,313
Want me to come?

1016
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:37,516
All right. Come on.

1017
01:09:40,116 --> 01:09:41,458
Come on, Clark.

1018
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:45,717
The night is young. They're giving away
free sandwiches at the blood bank.

1019
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,018
I'm not worthy of a sandwich.

1020
01:09:48,181 --> 01:09:51,049
I'm not a father, I'm not a husband,
I'm nothing!

1021
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:54,521
You may feel like nothing now,
but look on the bright side.

1022
01:09:54,675 --> 01:09:58,088
You used to be something.
Nobody can take that away from you.

1023
01:09:59,642 --> 01:10:00,918
Good-bye, Ellen.

1024
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:04,111
I'm sure you'll be happy
with Wayne Newton.

1025
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:06,894
Where am I going to go?

1026
01:10:07,065 --> 01:10:09,617
You can live with us
right here in Vegas.

1027
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,209
We'll dig you a room.

1028
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:13,386
And Rusty and poor Audrey...

1029
01:10:13,559 --> 01:10:15,793
At night you can sit outside...

1030
01:10:15,957 --> 01:10:18,997
...and you can tell us how much
more good you used to have it.

1031
01:10:19,226 --> 01:10:21,941
Look at all these happy families.

1032
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:24,176
Where did I go wrong?

1033
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:30,831
Without my family,
there is no Clark Griswold.

1034
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:32,817
We can go into business.

1035
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:35,541
We can raise more snakes,
open a petting zoo.

1036
01:10:35,704 --> 01:10:37,612
Yeah, that's what we could do.

1037
01:10:37,785 --> 01:10:40,595
We could have a lot of happy,
wonderful times.

1038
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:42,676
We'll get your money back.

1039
01:10:44,987 --> 01:10:46,896
I'm not worried about my money.

1040
01:10:47,482 --> 01:10:49,236
I don't care about it.

1041
01:10:50,263 --> 01:10:51,691
I must get my family back!

1042
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:53,935
What about my money?

1043
01:10:54,108 --> 01:10:55,864
Stay here, I'll be back.

1044
01:10:57,877 --> 01:10:59,153
Police, emergency.

1045
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:05,397
Open up!

1046
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,533
Don't be alarmed, he's with me.

1047
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:16,205
Say: "Cheese."

1048
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:28,309
It's Dean Martin's recipe.

1049
01:11:28,472 --> 01:11:30,294
I always make too much.

1050
01:11:30,716 --> 01:11:32,951
Thank you for having me for dinner.

1051
01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:37,170
There's something I must tell you.

1052
01:11:38,782 --> 01:11:39,722
Oh, no.

1053
01:11:41,017 --> 01:11:42,388
Wayne, please, don't.

1054
01:11:42,619 --> 01:11:44,949
I've always been a moral man.

1055
01:11:46,138 --> 01:11:49,754
But my resolve is melting
in the light of your smile.

1056
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,372
Maybe you're hungry. More pasta?

1057
01:11:52,535 --> 01:11:53,436
There's Treasure Island.

1058
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,566
There's Harrah's. There's the Mirage.

1059
01:11:55,738 --> 01:11:56,851
Next, Wayne Newton's house.

1060
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:01,425
Wayne, please.

1061
01:12:02,462 --> 01:12:03,411
Please.

1062
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:13,750
Don't worry, I'm here.

1063
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,255
Get out of my way.

1064
01:12:15,515 --> 01:12:17,336
Hands off my wife!

1065
01:12:21,182 --> 01:12:23,513
Clark, it's not the way it looks.

1066
01:12:23,676 --> 01:12:25,019
We're having pasta.

1067
01:12:26,045 --> 01:12:26,937
I've been a fool.

1068
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,195
And not a loveable fool who clowns
for the delight of children.

1069
01:12:32,058 --> 01:12:33,583
But a fool who's...

1070
01:12:33,823 --> 01:12:35,415
...only fooling himself.

1071
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:39,088
You're back.

1072
01:12:39,261 --> 01:12:41,813
You have got to be kidding me.

1073
01:12:41,975 --> 01:12:44,152
Why don't you go sing something?

1074
01:12:45,275 --> 01:12:48,305
I've learned that
a family vacation only works...

1075
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:51,825
...when you're with your family.
You and Russ and...

1076
01:12:51,998 --> 01:12:53,015
Audrey.

1077
01:12:53,177 --> 01:12:54,289
Audrey.

1078
01:12:54,462 --> 01:12:55,575
You're my family.

1079
01:12:56,313 --> 01:13:00,792
The most important thing is for us to
get back together before it's too late.

1080
01:13:01,473 --> 01:13:02,413
What do you say?

1081
01:13:03,065 --> 01:13:04,178
I'm with you.

1082
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:06,010
Let's go get our kids.

1083
01:13:12,282 --> 01:13:13,711
- Is there a charge?
- No, sir.

1084
01:13:13,883 --> 01:13:14,833
Park it.

1085
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:21,077
Have you seen him?

1086
01:13:21,249 --> 01:13:22,362
Mr. Pappagiorgio.

1087
01:13:22,525 --> 01:13:24,760
- Lanai Six.
- He's my son.

1088
01:13:24,989 --> 01:13:26,994
Mr. Pappagiorgio?

1089
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:28,826
Let's go.

1090
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:31,646
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1091
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,060
Clark, do something.

1092
01:13:39,231 --> 01:13:40,182
Look out!

1093
01:13:50,108 --> 01:13:52,765
Oh, my little baby boy!

1094
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,862
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1095
01:14:04,513 --> 01:14:05,626
Am I right?

1096
01:14:06,077 --> 01:14:06,843
Am I?

1097
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:13,730
So I says to him, I said,
"Get your own monkey."

1098
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:16,128
Oh, my Lord! Rusty!

1099
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:19,216
You must be lost.
This is Mr. Pappagiorgio.

1100
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:22,256
His name is not Pappagiorgio,
he's Rusty Griswold!

1101
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:24,500
He's a "C plus" student.
Now, out of the pool!

1102
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:26,044
Let's go, young man!

1103
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:27,962
Now! Get dressed!

1104
01:14:32,287 --> 01:14:35,002
I'm looking for this underage kid
named Pappagiorgio.

1105
01:14:35,165 --> 01:14:37,716
Yes, he stole my wallet.
He's back there.

1106
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:40,507
Where's your sister?

1107
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:42,674
She's with Vickie somewhere.

1108
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:44,026
Where's Vickie?

1109
01:14:56,677 --> 01:14:59,392
- Mr. Pappagiorgio, your usual table?
- Not tonight.

1110
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:01,463
You are in deep trouble, my friend.

1111
01:15:02,268 --> 01:15:03,649
Excuse me.

1112
01:15:13,087 --> 01:15:14,842
Hey, everybody!

1113
01:15:15,005 --> 01:15:16,347
Where's Audrey?

1114
01:15:19,647 --> 01:15:20,923
Oh, my God!

1115
01:15:24,126 --> 01:15:25,305
Our baby!

1116
01:15:25,478 --> 01:15:28,125
Hang on, honey,
Daddy's coming to get you!

1117
01:15:30,273 --> 01:15:31,166
Move!

1118
01:15:31,971 --> 01:15:33,630
What do you think you're doing?

1119
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:36,028
You told me to get a summer job!

1120
01:15:36,287 --> 01:15:39,548
Ten years of tap dancing lessons
and this is how you repay me?

1121
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:41,139
Let's go!

1122
01:15:41,312 --> 01:15:43,700
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1123
01:15:44,352 --> 01:15:46,040
Come on, let's go.

1124
01:15:56,005 --> 01:15:59,064
I don't know what I was thinking.
Let's go home now.

1125
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,187
When are we going?

1126
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,364
Let's quit while we're ahead.

1127
01:16:02,526 --> 01:16:04,829
Ahead or behind, what does it matter?

1128
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:07,390
We still have each other.

1129
01:16:09,634 --> 01:16:12,606
When we get home, even though
I lost most of our money...

1130
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:13,950
Wait a minute.

1131
01:16:14,276 --> 01:16:16,511
"I've lost most of our money"?

1132
01:16:17,248 --> 01:16:19,071
How much did you lose?

1133
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:22,207
Well, with the checks
and the credit cards...

1134
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:25,468
...some trips to the ATM and
the plane tickets I cashed in...

1135
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:26,686
I don't know...

1136
01:16:27,175 --> 01:16:30,436
$22,000, $23,000.

1137
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:31,548
Somewhere in there.

1138
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:33,563
What about my tuition?

1139
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:34,848
And my snowboard?

1140
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:36,603
We still have our love.

1141
01:16:37,955 --> 01:16:40,123
That's what I've come to realize.

1142
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:43,643
Clark, how much money
do you have right now?

1143
01:16:45,897 --> 01:16:46,749
I'm broke.

1144
01:16:48,035 --> 01:16:48,831
Rusty?

1145
01:16:48,993 --> 01:16:51,967
I spent it all.
Having an entourage is expensive.

1146
01:16:52,293 --> 01:16:53,406
Audrey?

1147
01:16:53,569 --> 01:16:54,998
No pockets.

1148
01:16:57,799 --> 01:16:59,390
I've got...

1149
01:17:00,839 --> 01:17:01,788
...$2.

1150
01:17:05,096 --> 01:17:06,919
Get our money back.

1151
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,565
There.

1152
01:17:17,315 --> 01:17:19,493
This is not the way to do this.

1153
01:17:19,655 --> 01:17:22,274
Can't we just get your parents
to wire us some money?

1154
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:28,029
Oh, keno. This is easy.
I saw this on TV.

1155
01:17:34,857 --> 01:17:37,571
Okay, you've got to pick ten numbers.

1156
01:17:37,801 --> 01:17:40,352
We must play the kids' birthdays.
Sixteen, seven.

1157
01:17:40,515 --> 01:17:42,213
And Dad's football number, 44.

1158
01:17:50,211 --> 01:17:52,600
Excuse me, is that your family?

1159
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:55,064
You're lucky man.

1160
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:57,088
Luckiest guy on earth.

1161
01:17:58,115 --> 01:17:59,543
The grandparent's anniversary.

1162
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,363
I never got married.

1163
01:18:02,536 --> 01:18:04,319
I was afraid to take the risk.

1164
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:06,400
Beautiful children.

1165
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:10,083
Oh, thank you. We're very blessed.

1166
01:18:10,793 --> 01:18:12,644
This thing is money, money.

1167
01:18:12,808 --> 01:18:14,236
Let me tell you something.

1168
01:18:14,409 --> 01:18:15,455
Money isn't everything.

1169
01:18:16,356 --> 01:18:17,890
I sit here alone...

1170
01:18:18,082 --> 01:18:18,946
...nobody cares.

1171
01:18:19,271 --> 01:18:22,139
If I win, I have nobody
to share it with.

1172
01:18:24,805 --> 01:18:26,301
You have your health.

1173
01:18:26,474 --> 01:18:28,067
It seems you have a hobby.

1174
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:30,617
Yeah, a hobby I got. My health?

1175
01:18:31,692 --> 01:18:33,993
If I had a family,
I'd want it like yours.

1176
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,870
Tonight, consider yourself
part of our family.

1177
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:43,747
I'll take you up on it.

1178
01:18:44,965 --> 01:18:46,624
Really, thank you.

1179
01:18:46,787 --> 01:18:47,688
Nice of you.

1180
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:48,475
Good luck.

1181
01:18:48,647 --> 01:18:50,470
The game's almost starting.

1182
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:55,649
Seven.

1183
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,471
It's seven.

1184
01:18:57,644 --> 01:18:59,495
It's Audrey's birthday!

1185
01:18:59,878 --> 01:19:01,566
We're going to do it!

1186
01:19:01,739 --> 01:19:02,910
Ten.

1187
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:07,811
Fourteen.

1188
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:09,892
Doesn't matter.

1189
01:19:10,285 --> 01:19:13,095
Even eight matches wins $15,500.

1190
01:19:13,574 --> 01:19:14,754
Twenty-two.

1191
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,427
Thirty-three.

1192
01:19:22,053 --> 01:19:22,848
Eighty.

1193
01:19:36,678 --> 01:19:38,434
Your final number, 54.

1194
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,926
I won!

1195
01:19:49,099 --> 01:19:50,786
I won! I won!

1196
01:19:51,371 --> 01:19:52,483
I won!

1197
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,524
I won!

1198
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:56,703
I won!

1199
01:19:57,576 --> 01:20:01,192
All the years I've waited for this!
I've been coming in here for years!

1200
01:20:01,355 --> 01:20:04,702
I've never won, never won once,
and now I won!

1201
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:09,344
The money is mine. I have the money,
the money is mine. I got it!

1202
01:20:09,517 --> 01:20:12,643
For the first time, I have the mo...

1203
01:20:19,597 --> 01:20:20,709
Sir...

1204
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:21,995
...are you okay?

1205
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:28,545
Go get someone.

1206
01:20:31,048 --> 01:20:31,997
Sir.

1207
01:20:36,074 --> 01:20:37,349
Oh, my God.

1208
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:39,104
I won!

1209
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:41,665
I won the money! I won!

1210
01:20:41,991 --> 01:20:43,276
Did you hear me?

1211
01:20:43,343 --> 01:20:45,252
It's okay. It's here, right here.

1212
01:20:45,415 --> 01:20:47,871
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

1213
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:49,894
That's wonderful.

1214
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:55,082
That's wonderful.

1215
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:32,678
What did he say?

1216
01:21:33,484 --> 01:21:34,912
He said, "Take the ticket."

1217
01:21:36,946 --> 01:21:39,248
He said, "Take the ticket"?

1218
01:21:39,564 --> 01:21:41,089
I think he did.

1219
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:50,373
He's gone.

1220
01:21:50,766 --> 01:21:52,137
There was nothing you could do.

1221
01:21:52,685 --> 01:21:53,959
We don't know his name.

1222
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:57,738
He was Mr. Ellis.
The loneliest guy I ever saw.

1223
01:21:57,901 --> 01:22:01,412
He would've given anything to have
someone sit with him and be kind.

1224
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,541
Jeez.

1225
01:22:47,725 --> 01:22:51,821
I hope you kids have learned something
about the dangers of gambling.

1226
01:22:52,013 --> 01:22:54,314
No, Sparklett,
don't blame the gambling.

1227
01:22:54,573 --> 01:22:56,808
Gambling is what made America great.

1228
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:58,314
You see, kids...

1229
01:22:58,736 --> 01:23:02,476
...when Columbus set sail
on a little rickety boat...

1230
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,897
...and let it ride all the way
to the New World, it was a gamble.

1231
01:23:07,444 --> 01:23:09,036
Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison...

1232
01:23:09,621 --> 01:23:11,529
...Albert Einstein, all gamblers.

1233
01:23:11,856 --> 01:23:13,198
Wasn't Einstein German?

1234
01:23:13,457 --> 01:23:15,117
Hard to tell from his accent.

1235
01:23:15,538 --> 01:23:17,130
But I do know one thing.

1236
01:23:17,524 --> 01:23:19,855
When a beautiful, young co-ed...

1237
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:23,211
...took a chance on a gangly boy
of a man named Clark...

1238
01:23:23,758 --> 01:23:25,829
...she was taking a gamble, too.

1239
01:23:31,852 --> 01:23:34,729
Ellen Priscilla Ruth Smith Griswold...

1240
01:23:38,959 --> 01:23:41,299
...will you remarry me?

1241
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:56,530
Ellen Griswold, do you promise
to love and honor Clark...

1242
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:58,092
...for as long as you live?

1243
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:01,775
Oh, God!

1244
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:05,937
I do.

1245
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:08,076
Clark Griswold...

1246
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,791
I love you, Eddie.

1247
01:24:12,977 --> 01:24:16,804
Do you promise to love and honor Ellen
for as long as you both shall live?

1248
01:24:17,456 --> 01:24:18,252
I do.

1249
01:24:18,549 --> 01:24:22,443
I don't care if you ruined my life,
I love you!

1250
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,455
By the power vested in me...

1251
01:24:25,618 --> 01:24:30,154
...by the Las Vegas Entertainers'
Association, I pronounce you married.

1252
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:31,852
You may kiss the bride.

1253
01:24:52,242 --> 01:24:53,671
This is for you.

1254
01:24:54,582 --> 01:24:57,134
Clark, were did all this come from?

1255
01:24:57,776 --> 01:25:00,816
We were very fortunate last night,
Eddie, and...

1256
01:25:00,979 --> 01:25:04,489
I think we Griswolds learned
something on this vacation.

1257
01:25:04,662 --> 01:25:07,529
And that is that it's not
what you have but...

1258
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:09,773
...who you have to share it with.

1259
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,539
In a minute, Russ.

1260
01:25:11,701 --> 01:25:15,758
The promise of material possessions
can often blind one...

1261
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:17,456
What is it, Russ?

1262
01:25:17,619 --> 01:25:19,278
Those four cars over there...

1263
01:25:21,043 --> 01:25:22,251
...they're mine.

1264
01:25:24,246 --> 01:25:26,413
What do you mean? They're yours?

1265
01:25:30,969 --> 01:25:32,399
Where did they come from?

1266
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:34,480
Four slot machines.

1267
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:37,683
I put a dollar in and got a car.
I put a dollar in and got a car.

1268
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:39,850
Yeah, yeah, I think I get it.

1269
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:41,605
Give me the keys.

1270
01:25:49,595 --> 01:25:51,378
Ellen, drive the red one.

1271
01:25:51,705 --> 01:25:53,459
You take the white one.

1272
01:25:53,623 --> 01:25:56,720
You take the Mustang.
And I'll take that big black thing.

1273
01:25:56,884 --> 01:25:58,744
After you, Mr. Pappagiorgio.

1274
01:25:58,897 --> 01:26:00,010
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Clark.

1275
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:08,018
Bye, y'all!

1276
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:09,677
Drive carefully!

1277
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:11,442
Have a good trip!
