<i>I write under the name of Jane Doe.
That's the kind of gal I am.</i>

<i>This Greek seafood house
is part of a successful chain.</i>

7
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:58,590
<i>But, believe me,
it's not because of the food.</i>

00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:08,150
120,000 from the Gonzalez fight.

11
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:12,912
That includes 60
from our chain in the Valley.

12
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:16,352
Twenty from Long Beach. 120 total.

13
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,517
Put that under halibut.

14
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,069
180,000 from the track.

15
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:23,839
Scrod.

16
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,509
We got over two million in scrod
this month.

17
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:29,360
Scrod's making a comeback, all right?

18
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,438
[man #1]
How are you listing my stake?

19
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:35,681
- [man #2] Breakage.
- [man #1] $75,000 worth of breakage?

[glass shatters]

we break plates, we're clumsy!

22
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:47,560
[man #1] Stop it.
We gotta be cross town in 30 minutes.

23
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:49,354
You wanna wash up?

24
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:52,520
[man #2] My wife gets suspicious
if I don't smell like fish.

25
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,599
[man #1] I got it. You get the lights.

00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:57,521
- [man #2] Where's Poppa?
- [man #1] In the back.

27
00:01:57,722 --> 00:02:00,361
[man #2] Tell him to hurry.
Phil, I'll drop you first.

28
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:02,837
[Phil] You better.

00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:19,796
- [gasps] Hi.
- What's your name, little lady?

00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:24,758
My name? Peggy Lee... Zorba.
Peggy Lee Zorba.

31
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:28,922
- You're cute!
- Do you mind if I freshen up a bit?

32
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:31,432
Splash a little water on my face.

33
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:34,441
Whatever makes you feel sexy.

34
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:36,201
- OK.
- [chuckles]

35
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,553
Just wait outside.
I'll be right out.

36
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,715
What the hell was that?

37
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:05,199
- If it's a cop, kill him.
- Hi. Mary Poppins!

38
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:07,520
If it's a reporter, cripple him.

[tyres screech, brakes squeal]

00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,235
You're never driving again!

41
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:27,675
I just did what you told me to do.

42
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:30,479
- There's a new thing called brakes!
- Shut up!

43
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:39,435
Good. Brilliant as usual, Fletch.
We'll run it in the next edition.

44
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:42,921
- Great. See you in two weeks.
- Er, Fletch, there's...

45
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:47,721
"Er, Fletch"? Frank, I see
a double-cross in your eyes.

46
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,517
You promised me a vacation.

47
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:53,320
- Right after the sewer story.
- What? You can't do this to me.

48
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,234
I spent eight nights on my knees
dressed like Dolly Parton at a funeral.

49
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,278
I got felt up.
I got dishpan hands and sore knees!

50
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:03,000
Three guys tried to kill me.
Do you give a crap?

51
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:05,674
- You promised me a vacation!
- You'll get one.

52
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:08,798
- After the sewer system exposé.
- You owe me a vacation!

53
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,758
- In July.
- That's two months.

54
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:13,036
A great reporter knows the facts.

55
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:16,795
By the way, the computer disallowed
your undocumented expenses.

56
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,839
- It'll come out of this week's pay.
- You can't do that.

57
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:23,641
There's nothing I can do about it.
It's all done automatically.

58
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:42,085
On top of everything else,
I think I'm getting my period.

59
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:11,319
No wonder I got a fumigation alert.
How'd you get in here?

60
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,677
The window was open.

61
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:17,244
I knocked, and I could swear
I heard you say, "Come in".

62
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:21,327
You know how to cover your ass, Gillet.
Although those pants are a mistake.

63
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:26,606
You owe me $4,381 in back alimony.

64
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:28,685
What? I was married to you?

65
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:34,319
You're right. I've been foolishly
squandering my salary on food and heat.

66
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:37,486
You have one week
to comply with Judge Proctor's orders.

67
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,680
Payment in full.
Otherwise you go to jail.

68
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:43,038
Wendy doesn't need the money.

69
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:47,719
I hear she's been banging some balding,
wimpy lawyer who can't get it up.

70
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,997
- May I see that?
- Be my guest.

71
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,643
Nice briefcase.
Couldn't guess your weight?

72
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,885
Oh! I'm sorry. I got it.

73
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,080
Never mind, I'll take care of it.

74
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,087
Look at this. A note from
the Oakwood Potency Clinic.

75
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:05,601
"Sorry to inform you, we cannot process
sperm counts as low as yours."

76
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:08,039
- Here we are. What about this?
- Be careful!

77
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,240
Uh-oh! I am terribly sorry!

78
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,565
- You did that intentionally.
- I did not.

79
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,078
- That was good juice too.
- Leave it alone.

80
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,122
- I got an idea. My mistake.
- Where are you going?

81
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,718
My mess. I'll clean it up.

82
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:22,806
- What are you doing?
- What's this?

83
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,126
You are damaging personal property
and I'm gonna...

84
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:29,639
The ink is running.
I didn't expect that.

85
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,967
There we are!
Clean as a whistle.

86
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,163
- Thanks for coming by, Marvin.
- Expect to hear from my lawyer.

87
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,329
Oh, Gillet, one more thing.
Come back here. It's very important.

88
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,489
They do a thing now where they make
an incision and push the hair together.

89
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,525
Or try a transplant. Maybe the hair from
your ass. Might make you smarter. Bye.

90
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,447
Betty, how 'bout lunch
at the In and Out Burger?

91
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,083
I'm not hungry.

92
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,929
Forget the burger.
How about just the "in and out"?

93
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,928
- Very well. How about just the "in"?
- [groans]

94
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,927
Ooh!

00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:26,604
In and Out Burger.
May I take your order, please?

98
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:31,123
Mr Fletcher? This is Amanda Ray Ross.
I represented your Aunt Belle Fletcher.

99
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,606
Good ol' Aunt Belle.
How the hell is she?

100
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:36,962
- She's deceased, Mr Fletcher.
- I guess she could be better.

101
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:38,490
You're hard to find.

102
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,921
I was touring with the Stones.
How can I help?

103
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:42,689
- Didn't you get my message?
- No.

104
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,802
I'm the executor of your aunt's will.

105
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:48,607
You are the major beneficiary
of your aunt's estate, Belle Isle.

106
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:53,323
About this expense.
$58 for leg waxing? That's bullshit.

107
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,602
Yeah, but feel how smooth they are.

108
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:58,770
<i>[Amanda] It consists of 80 acres

00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:01,770
<i>- Wait. Did you say plantation?
- Yes, indeed.</i>

110
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:04,281
<i>- She left it to me?
- According to her will.</i>

111
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:07,689
- Can I get back to you?
- Hair by Ziggy? Who's Ziggy?

112
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:12,329
5-0-4... Shut up, Frank.
Yeah. I'll get right back to you.

113
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:15,251
Can't we return some of it?
What about the lingerie?

114
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:18,171
- I ate it.
- Be serious for one minute.

115
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,805
I quit.

116
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:23,642
I'm not unreasonable about legitimate
expenses. The sewer story...

117
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:25,127
I quit, Frank.

118
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,086
I'm gonna advance you
for the hip boots and wet suit.

119
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:30,727
Frank, I'm really quitting.

120
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,970
Fletch, look,
I got a little A-frame up at Arrowhead.

121
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:37,051
Why don't you go there,
take a couple of weeks, relax?

122
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:39,528
I'm really gonna miss you.

123
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,644
Maybe that's an overstatement.

124
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,811
Treat this as good news.
You can write my Jane Doe column.

125
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:47,163
You're not gonna quit.
I'll tell you why.

126
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:49,603
- Why?
- You have journalistic integrity.

127
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:54,603
And you have a sense of loyalty. You'll
never give up the quest for truth.

128
00:08:54,813 --> 00:09:00,046
Yes. I can't abandon the principles
that nurtured me lo these many years.

129
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:04,247
Wrap them up with the shit on my desk
and ship them to my Louisiana mansion.

130
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:06,649
Bye.

131
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,572
What happened?

132
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:12,529
My husband said I was crazy to go
2,000 miles to have my nose done.

133

[snorts as she laughs]

134
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:18,168
That's an interesting watch.
Is it a prize of some sort?

135
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:21,684
- No.
- It certainly looks like one.

136
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,170
It's a championship Laker watch.

137
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,652
Oh! Are you a Laker?

138
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:33,087
I used to date one.
Only thing I have to remember him by.

Lord, what was that?

141
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:45,814
We just clipped a Piper Cub. The pilot's
OK. I just saw him parachuting.

142
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,051
[laughs, snorts]

143
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:52,771
I love a man with a sense of humour.
What did you say your name was?

144
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,052

Lord, I hate to fly. I wish I was
gettin' off in Thibodaux like you.

It's two more stops to Selma. All those
ups and downs and ups and downs.

You should try holding your breath.

Give me that, boy!

166

[spits]

167
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:19,931
- Thank you, sir.
- Quiet down.

168
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,093
- Uncle Frank?
- Yes, sir?

169
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:26,495
- You know my favourite tune.
- Sure do, Colonel.

170
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:29,735
Would you mind
if I sat in your lap, Colonel?

171
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:32,327
Please do, Betty Lee.
Please do.

172
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:35,257
The field hands would like
to dance for you.

173
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,414
Dance for me?

174
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:40,416
- Why, I'll dance for them!
- [cheering]

175
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,573
Yes, sir!

Mr Fletcher. I'm Amanda Ray Ross.

190
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,094
- I spoke with you on the phone.
- Oh, yes. That was you?

191
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,097
Great.

192
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,212
- Do you have any luggage?
- Just one piece.

193
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,810
[Amanda] Plannin' on stayin' long?

194
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,013
Just long enough to see Mount Rushmore
and squeeze in a little ice fishing.

195
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,854
I'm on the board
of the Pontchartrain Society.

196
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,257
We help preserve and restore
some of these lovely mansions.

197
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:23,740
We headed to Belle Isle?

198
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:26,057
You must be dying to see it,
Mr Fletcher.

199
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:27,296
Call me Fletch.

200
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,891
Your house is not as grand
as some others in the neighbourhood.

201
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,537
It doesn't matter. It's the thought
that counts. Eighty acres?

202
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:38,336
Mm-hmm. Isn't it strikin'?

203
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:45,130
Your aunt tried to keep things
in their natural state.

204
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:48,450
She ever brush her hair?

205
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:52,293
- I can see you're disappointed.
- No, not at all!

206
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:56,619
A little spackling and some napalm,
this place would make a nice mausoleum.

207
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:10,332
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

208
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:14,854
Oh! I was aimin' to fix that today.
How do you do?

209
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,338
I be Calculus Entterby.
You be Mr and Mrs Fletcher?

210
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:23,013
I be Fletch. Geometry Fletch.
She be Miss Trigonometry Ross.

211
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:27,420
Pleased, I'm sure. Your Aunt Belle
told me you'd be takin' over the place,

212
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,658
and I'm extendin' my "condulations".

213
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:33,614
Right. You work here?

214
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:36,211
Your Aunt Belle and I,
we had an arrangement.

215
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:39,972
And I was hopin' we could
make an extenuation of it.

216
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:44,222
Help me get your stuff out the car here.
Come on.

217
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:49,862
You mind your step.
Our families go back hundreds of years.

218
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:54,375
Your great grandparents owned my great
grandparents. That's how it all started.

219
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,051
Ever hear of
the Emancipation Proclamation?

220
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:01,535
I heard somethin' about it,
but I don't recall exactly.

221
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:04,382
It didn't get much publicity
around these parts.

222
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,143
- I'll bet.
- Excuse me, sir.

223
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:10,139
Could you give me a hand?

224
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:15,054
Just pull it towards you.
Just pull it.

225
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:18,022
Come on, come on. Just pull it.

226
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:20,260
Just pull it on over. That's it.

227
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:22,261
Don't scar the car.

228
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,932
Is there any electricity or gas?

229
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:28,693
- Everything works.
- No cable TV, I guess?

230
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:33,341
If I'd known, I'd have straightened out
a bit and stocked your refrigerator.

231
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:36,342
- No food?
- No refrigerator.

232
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:39,297
We need to do some paperwork.
Want a lift into town?

233
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,894
- And leave my estate unattended?
- It's not yours till you sign.

234
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:46,414
I can make you some dinner.
Ease the culture shock.

235
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:48,580
That sounds great.

236
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:51,618
- Should I be doin' anything?
- No, not really.

237
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,703
After you get that trunk upstairs
and finish your nap,

238
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:58,784
you could fix that step and jump down,
turn around and pick a bale of cotton.

239
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:02,739
While I'm gone, see to it Miss Scarlett
stays away from the Union Army.

240
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,581
[Amanda] More wine?

241
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:11,140
[Fletch] You trying
to take advantage of me?

242
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,735
[Amanda] Not yet.
You need to sign these papers.

243
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:20,817
- Do you mind if I read 'em first?
- Be my guest.

244
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:24,460
Had you talked to your aunt recently?

245
00:16:24,665 --> 00:16:28,499
That depends on your view of history.
It's been 16 years.

246
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:32,017
- Sign all three?
- Please.

247
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:35,935
I just wondered. She changed her will
three weeks before she died.

248
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:40,503
Well, lucky for me.
Why'd she do that?

249
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:44,745
I don't know. She was old.
Seemed to be under a lot of strain.

250
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:48,982
Dying always does that to you.

251
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:55,023
Congratulations. You know, you can make
yourself some good money out of this.

252
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:59,458
A realtor contacted me
with an unusually high offer. 225,000.

253
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,100
- Dollars?
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,416
Let me ask you this.

255
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,017
Don't you think if I wait
a little longer, they might go up?

256
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:12,264
- They might.
- And I just got here, didn't I?

257
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,139
No sale?

258
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:20,583
While you're thinking,
what are you gonna do with the land?

259
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:24,939
I don't know. Raise chitlins...
The chitlin' market as high as it is.

260
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:29,060
They're mean little animals,
but their coats are worth a fortune.

261
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:35,257
$225,000?
What do you think I oughta do?

262
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:40,897
If I were you,
I would proceed slowly and carefully.

263
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,702
That's my specialty.

264
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:47,741
- Would you like dessert?
- What do you have in mind?

265
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:51,736
How 'bout something sweet...
and Southern?

266
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:14,147
[muffled groan]

267
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,146
[Fletch] I used your toothbrush.

268
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:36,422
Would've used your razor, but it looks
like you've been gardening with it.

269
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:41,658
Gee, I can't believe we slept this late.

270
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:46,147
Amanda?
Want to drive me to Belle Isle?

271
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,540
I guess not.

272
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,626
It was good, but not that good.

273
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,420
Morning, Mr Fletcher. If that's your
real name. I'm Billy Jo Hendrick.

274
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,939
Howdy.

275
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,266
What's your relationship to Amanda Ray?

276
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,506
She was my attorney.

277
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,020
She was working on my briefs. [chuckles]

278
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,779
- You come here, y'all just hit it off?
- So to speak.

279
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,300
Sparks just flew.
That's what you're gonna tell me.

280
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,785
Wonder why that never happens to me?

281
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,349
Wonder why.

282
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:40,184
Were y'all usin' some drugs you brought
in from California by any chance?

283
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:42,905
[sighs] Just some beaujolais.

284
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,420
Beaujolais?

285
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:48,020
It's a pretty popular drug
made from grapes?

286
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,825
- You feel like makin' a statement?
- A statement?

287
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:56,147
"Ask not what your country
can do for you,

288
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:58,262
ask what you can do for your
country."

289
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:04,023
You wanna make it hard. Let's see how
you feel after some time in the tank.

290
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,459
Y'all, come on.

291
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,502
- All of us?
- Just you.

292
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:10,828
- What's the charge?
- Pissin' me off.

293
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:13,227
- Felony or misdemeanour?
- That's it!

294
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,547
[clunk]

295
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,061
You're cleaner than
most of the ones we get.

296
00:20:20,272 --> 00:20:23,708
You smell nice.
I expect you'll be popular.

297
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,543
You have to read me my rights.

298
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:30,028
Or at least find someone who can read
to do it for you.

299
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:33,468
[keys rattle in lock]

300
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:39,225
A little gamey in here.
Not much ventilation, huh?

301
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,148
How's the chow?

302
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:54,791
You know, you shouldn't wear so much
eye make-up. It makes you look cheap.

303
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:57,348
You're sittin' on my bunk.

304
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:59,987
- Sorry.
- Shut up!

305
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:05,744
Take your pants off.

306
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,151
Er... I don't even know your name.

307
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,184
Bend over.

308
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:17,191
Ben? Nice to meet you.
Victor Hugo.

309
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:21,068
You don't have a middle name, do you?
Everybody else here seems to.

310
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:25,027
- What are you in for, Ben?
- Molesting a dead horse.

311
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,431
Ooh, there's no crime in that.

312
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:32,343
That's your right as an American.
I'm tryin' to cut down myself.

313
00:21:32,554 --> 00:21:36,706
His missus hit him on the head with
a hammer whilst he was eatin' a sausage

314
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:40,190
and almost choked him to death.

315
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:45,627
OK, beautiful, let's hope another long
night in the tank has sobered you up.

316
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:50,633
Ben?

317
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:55,223
If I don't hear from you on
Valentine's Day, I'll be disappointed.

318
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:58,028
- [growls]
- [laughs]

319
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:01,906
Mr Johnson,
I'm surprised to see you here.

320
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:05,869
Judge Watkins usually assigns
these small potatoes to Billy Ray.

321
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:10,591
He's on vacation. This is the price
I pay for the proximity of my office.

322
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,831
Excuse me. Sir?

323
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:15,833
You don't have a card, do you?
Or a price list?

324
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,630
Well, matter of fact, I do.

325
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,787
I'm Hamilton Johnson.
I'm an attorney at law.

326
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:27,670
You take cases or do you specialise
in transvestite necrophiliacs?

327
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,070
Not enough evidence to hold you.

328
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:34,791
Just a form of intimidation putting
you in a cell with that Neanderthal.

329
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:38,431
She wasn't so bad. If she'd just fix up
her hair and shave her back.

330
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:42,874
It's so embarrassin', this sort of thing
still goes on in the new South.

331
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:47,069
'Course, 20 years ago a Yankee like you
could've been lyin' in the ditch.

332
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,551
I'm assumin', of course, that...

333
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:54,544
you had nothin' whatsoever to do
with the death of Amanda Ray.

334
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:57,793
- Sure hope not.
- Hop in.

335
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:02,387
I was shocked to hear about this.
She was such a dear friend.

336
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,552
So tragic...

337
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:08,669
when this happens
to somebody so young and healthy.

338
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:12,186
- Was she feelin' all right last night?
- She felt great to me.

339
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:15,149
[Hamilton]
Just smell that soft Southern air.

340
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:21,116
It's so sad to see
this beautiful pastoral countryside

341
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:25,276
blighted by the greed of a few men
in pursuit of the almighty dollar.

342
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:27,308
That's my place over there.

343
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:32,272
The trees just beyond it screen off the
Bibleland Amusement Park in the daytime,

344
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,593
but at night,
they make a hell of a racket.

345
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:45,031
- Thanks for everything, Hamilton.
- Most welcome. Just call me Ham.

346
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:48,945
Ham, call me Fletch.

347
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:53,594
All right, Fletch.
Anything I can do to help ya.

348
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:55,752
Fletch!

349
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:59,633
- Might I give you some personal advice?
- Is it free?

350
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,877
To the sheriff and his sort of people,
you're an outsider.

351
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,114
Guilty in spite of the law.

352
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:08,991
Should I get outta town
before sundown?

353
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,587
It's not that bad, but...

354
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,188
if I were you,
lookin' for peace and quiet...

355
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:18,708
Well, they can make it
a might uncomfortable for ya.

356
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:21,591
- It's gonna take time.
- Thanks, Ham.

357
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:23,709
Bye.

358
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:25,749
My pleasure.

359
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,914
Anything I can do for ya.

360
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:48,909
Welcome back.
I thought you run off for good.

361
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,075
Does this car run?

362
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,192
Yeah, but Miss Belle stopped drivin' it
when the brakes ran out.

363
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:58,038
I run a few errands from time to time,

364
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:01,072
but if you wanna stop it,
you got to think ahead.

365
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:06,990
Hmm. I finally got the place
straightened out for you.

366
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:09,872
Mm-hmm. When was that?
Back in 1970?

367
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,200
Your Aunt Belle, she lived in this
one room. Didn't take up much space.

368
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,072
- Calculus?
- Hmm?

369
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,430
You don't see a spider, do you?

370
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,036
Spiders is good.

371
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,471
- They eats the cockroaches.
- Yeah, sure they do.

372
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,875
- [owl hoots]
- [Calculus] Mister Owl.

373
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,277
This is more like it.
This is what I came here for.

374
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,756
Yes, sir. Peace and quiet.

375
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,317
[megaphone] Scum, scum, scum!
Go back to where you're from!

376
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,273
- Friends of yours?
- Nothin' to me.

377
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,789
"The loyal sons of the...

378
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,630
[Klansman] Buford, where's the cross.
Did you bring the cross?

379
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:54,631
"...white race will not allow
any kind of alien infection...

380
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:58,076
to invade our beloved land."

381
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:04,790
Scum, scum, scum.
Go back to where you're from.

382
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:09,074
Do it together.
Scum, scum, scum. Go back...

383
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:12,910
Get the hell outta here and go home!
Scum! Pigs!

384
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:14,873
Sorry I'm late.

385
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,720
- Who goes there?
- Henry Himmler.

386
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:21,072
- What Klavan claims you?
- California Klavan, Cucamonga.

387
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:22,999
California?

388
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:26,034
I was passing through,
lookin' for something to do.

389
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:28,631
There was nothing goin' on
at the Rotary Club.

390
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:31,436
Welcome, Henry.
I'm the Grand Kleagle.

391
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:33,439
Oh.

392
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:41,761
California thing.
Pig-faced scum!

393
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,520
What's the occasion?

394
00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:47,158
Some undesirable carpetbagger...
I think.

395
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:52,675
Damn! Boys, I just got a closer peek.
There's nobody in there.

396
00:26:52,882 --> 00:26:56,841
- We're wasting our time.
- [grumbling]

397
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:04,955
- And I washed all these sheets!
- Who's this?

398
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:08,951
Oh. Sorry. Hi, fellas. Hank Himmler.

399
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:10,801
Hi, Hank.

400
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:15,838
The cross won't burn, nobody home.
Hell, it ain't like it used to be.

401
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:18,273
You said it.

402
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:22,954
I couldn't get over 13 guys out tonight.
Five of them are green recruits.

403
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:25,597
- Kinda stand-ins, you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:28,681
- We call 'em Klookies.
- Klookies?

405
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:33,354
That's good!
Of course, it's just a contract job.

406
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:35,315
Yeah. Contract job?

407
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:39,357
Yeah! We've been havin' a terrible time
down here. We've had to rent out.

408
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,355
Here I come!

409
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,555
[speak nonsense]

410
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:54,757
- Gene Hackman, kick your ass.
- It 's some kind of African dialect!

411
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,524
[speaks nonsense]

412
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:03,955
Hi.

413
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:08,920
[knocking at door]

414
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:22,963
Morning.

415
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:25,395
- Mr Fletcher?
- As far as you know.

416
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:28,073
I'm Becky Ann Culpepper.
Thibodaux Realty.

417
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:33,004
I'd offer you some coffee and eggs
Benedict, but we're all out of Benedict.

418
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:37,084
- Thanks. I've already eaten.
- What can I do to... for you?

419
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:41,961
You may have heard that there's a party
interested in acquiring your property.

420
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:44,360
A substantial offer.

421
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:50,121
- How substantial?
- $250,000.

422
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,595
Phew! I don't know.

423
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:56,445
I had big plans for this place.

424
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:59,479
Mini mall with a yoghurt bar
and a tanning parlour.

425
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:02,644
Well, Mr Fletcher,
all I know is $250,000

426
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:06,441
is a mighty generous price
for land in this area.

427
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:10,434
- Who's your client?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

428
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:15,197
- Well, then I'm not at liberty to sell.
- This is a tremendous opportunity.

429
00:29:15,406 --> 00:29:19,319
Tell you what. I'll consult with my
people who'll contact their people,

430
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:21,994
and they'll get in touch
with your people.

431
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:24,766
- Who are your people?
- Who are yours?

432
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:28,074
As I said,
I have to keep that confidential.

433
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:32,998
Very well. I'll just have my people
contact each other. Keep 'em busy.

434
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:36,165
All right. Well, just keep me in mind.
Here's my card.

435
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,164
Oh, I'll keep you in mind.

436
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:42,240
Hope we can do this again
sometime soon.

437
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,403
In about 10 minutes?

438
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:56,676
<i>[Fletch] That night I decided
to return to the scene of the crime.</i>

439
00:29:56,887 --> 00:30:00,482
<i>It let me check out my new car
and practise my parallel parking.</i>

440
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:02,882
[squeaking]

441
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:13,443
<i>[Fletch] So far the only really good
suspect in Amanda's death was me,</i>

442
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:16,242
<i>and I was pretty sure
that I didn't do it.</i>

443
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:20,043
<i>Amanda knew more than she'd let on,
but the only clue she'd left me</i>

444
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:23,923
<i>was a reference to Aunt Belle
changing her will just before she died.</i>

445
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,684
<i>I knew the local police force
was watching her place carefully</i>

446
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,844
<i>so there'd be no trouble getting in.</i>

447
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:35,322
<i>Over the years I found Mr Underhill's
credit card to be a useful tool,</i>

448
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:37,644
<i>much like Underhill himself.</i>

449
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:54,683
<i>As usual, I was willing to risk my life
to get a peek into a filing cabinet.</i>

450
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:58,768
<i>I love them when they're unlocked,
organized and tell me what I wanna know.</i>

451
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:01,039
<i>Belle's legal files were in good order,</i>

452
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:04,366
<i>with the exception of something missing
under "Bluebird".</i>

453
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:09,199
<i>She'd almost left Belle Isle
to a minister.</i>

454
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,367
<i>Obviously at one time
he must have touched her deeply.</i>

455
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,880
<i>I guess he didn't touch her
deeply enough, or in the right place.</i>

456
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,681
[door unlocks]

457
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:27,806
Thank you very much.
Couldn't find that light switch.

458
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,888
What the hell you doin' here?
This is a restricted area.

459
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,084
- Didn't you see the sign?
- Signs! All I see is signs. Look here.

460
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,726
Stressed out "dormants",
walls deplaning to an alarming degree.

461
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,885
Deplaning?

462
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,048
This house is infested
with reticulermes Mario Cuomos.

463
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,206
- What's that?
- What's what?

464
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,129
Reticulermes.
You can't even say it yourself.

465
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,208
They are deadly
African microscopic termites.

466
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,649
They eat 100 times their weight
in five minutes.

467
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,604
Much like yourself.
This place is about ready to collapse.

468
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,483
- Who are you?
- Billie Jean King, Bug Busters.

469
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,124
My van's parked out front.

470
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,004
Mr King, I don't know nothin'
about no Bug Busters.

471
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:11,045
The Surgeon General was right.
They've been mighty busy here.

472
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:16,929
The only time you can catch 'em
is at night.

473
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,729
Ah-ha! I got one! See that?

474
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:24,968
These little buggers
are the piranhas of the insect world.

475
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:27,765
- The also feed on human flesh.
- Really?

476
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:30,360
- You bet.
- How do you know you got one?

477
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:34,450
I'm glad I asked that question. They
make this horrible high-pitched noise.

478
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:38,724
It's kinda like a tiny little scream.
Can you hear that?

479
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:41,571
Can you hear that?
Like a tiny little piglet.

480
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:44,923
No? Uh-oh.
I seem to have dropped it in your ear.

481
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,441
- You what?
- That's all right.

482
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:52,123
We better get that. Can't let that nest
in there. They multiply by masturbation.

483
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:55,085
The only way to get that out
is to get close to the floor.

484
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:58,443
Go on down. That's right.
They're drawn to the floorboards.

485
00:32:58,652 --> 00:33:01,371
Shake your head
like you're trying to get water out.

486
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:04,928
That's good. But hit it...
No, this side. That's right.

487
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:08,488
Now make that scream.
That'll draw 'em out. Squeal like a pig.

488
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:11,286
- [squeals]

Has all of them riches
brung you happiness, child?

00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,210

so that's not such a big deal.

so I wouldn't wanna get into it on TV.

Once we've had a chance to expand,

00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:20,622
- There's the hotel.
- Hi, Reverend.

617
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,659
We call it the Heavenly Hilton
and Convention Center.

618
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:26,619
Beyond that is the
Farnsworth Bible College.

619
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:30,535
If you look down the road, you see the
Jump for Jesus Trampoline Center.

620
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,340
- What do you think?
- It's unbelievable.

621
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:36,344
Think I use
too many photographs of myself?

622
00:41:36,546 --> 00:41:39,777
No! No!
It worked for the Ayatollah.

623
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:42,500
Mr Fletcher,
your Belle Isle's a bit rundown.

624
00:41:42,706 --> 00:41:45,015
It'll eat you alive in maintenance.

625
00:41:45,226 --> 00:41:48,263
You don't know how much
your land would mean to us.

626
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:52,539
And to God, too, of course. After all,
he does give us our guidance now.

627
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:54,623
- Amen!
- You bet your ass.

628
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,706
My mother would say
"There's a tick for every dog."

629
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:59,584
What did your mother mean by that?

630
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:04,463
Why in God's name you let Farnsworth's
Ministry burrow into your fur?

631
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:09,582
Why would you think of givin' away your
property when you got a big cash offer?

632
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:15,464
I guess, after a lifetime of hedonism,
it's time to rededicate my life.

633
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:19,979
Nah, I just wanted to see what would
happen if I went along with him.

634
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:23,259
Well, it happened.
The sheriff's office called.

635
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,617
The charges against you were dropped.

636
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,385
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

637
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,262
The Ministry has
a good deal of influence around here.

638
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,901
I suppose you've heard that your...

639
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:39,102
aunt was under considerable emotional
strain in the weeks before she died?

640
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:43,784
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- So was my mother.

641
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:47,905
They took advantage of her.
These holy rollers.

642
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:52,067
When she was at death's door,
they preyed on her faith and her fear.

643
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:55,021
When she could no longer
make rational decisions,

644
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:58,425
persuaded her to give away our land
for that amusement park.

645
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:02,667
My guess is that your speedy conversion
and your promised gift

646
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:06,907
played no small part in the charges
against you being dropped.

647
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:12,180
Well, whatever.

648
00:43:12,388 --> 00:43:14,344
At least I'm off the hook.

649
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:18,938
And who or what do they think
is responsible for Amanda Ray's death?

650
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:21,219
The autopsy report come in today.

651
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:24,660
They said she died of a heart attack.
Natural causes.

652
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:31,741
Either she had some congenital defect,
or you're one hell of a lover.

653
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:35,461
Probably both.

- That's a relief.

659

So who's the odds-on favourite now?

660
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,300
Nobody.

661
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,546
They say she dropped dead in her sleep.

662
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,706
Yeah!

663
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,502
The odds on that?

664
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,144
Same as catchin' a bass this afternoon.

665
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,266
What's that?

666
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,109
About 258,000 to one.

667
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,141
You sure you don't wanna back out?

668
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,899

670
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:34,430
This be the morgue?
Have the police come yet?

671
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,825
- What?
- The police!

672
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:38,909
They was bringing a doctor
to make a death certificate.

You got a stiff, boy,

674
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:44,709
In my Cadillac.

675
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:47,948
Put him on the gurney.
Take him in the back with the rest.

<i>Don't bother me.

- Excuse me, sir.

678
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,267
I'll be right back now.

679
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:01,865

- His lucky golf cap.

680

Hey!

681
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,388
You gotta tag his toe.

682
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:11,986
- He got a name?
- Eldridge Cleaver.

683
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:15,070
Take him in the back, strip him.
Hold it.

684
00:45:16,232 --> 00:45:20,783
Let's see what Mr Cleaver has,
or should I say, had.

685
00:45:25,952 --> 00:45:28,147
Wait a minute.
Shouldn't I get that?

686
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:30,149
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

687
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:34,868
You call me whenever you want,
I'll tell you what time it is.

688
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:37,028
Now get movin'.

689
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:45,947
- Eldridge Cleaver.
- Shh.

690
00:45:47,273 --> 00:45:48,991
Good evening, Mr Hoffa.

691
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:52,503

- Yeah, go on.

You don't have a Tic Tac, do you?

697
00:46:58,234 --> 00:46:59,953
What happened? I black out?

698
00:47:00,155 --> 00:47:02,749
Did I land the plane safely?
Passengers hurt?

699
00:47:02,955 --> 00:47:04,593
- No.
- Everything's OK?

700
00:47:04,795 --> 00:47:06,831
Check that air-conditioning.

701
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:12,789
- [Calculus] What'd you find out?
- Cremated.

702
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:16,704
I wouldn't be surprised if all the
paperwork was burnt up with the body.

703
00:47:16,915 --> 00:47:21,750
<i>[Fletch] The morgue proved to be a dead
end. But I guess it is for most people.</i>

704
00:47:21,955 --> 00:47:25,425
<i>I had three questions.
Why was I cleared in Amanda's death?</i>

705
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:28,866
<i>Why, if she wasn't murdered,
was the body quickly destroyed?</i>

706
00:47:29,075 --> 00:47:33,227
<i>And when it comes to stewed prunes,
are three enough or are four too many?</i>

707
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:36,871
<i>When I got back to Belle Isle,
there was a cosy fire in the fireplace</i>

708
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:39,192
<i>and on the roof,
the walls and the porch.</i>

709
00:47:39,396 --> 00:47:41,591
<i>It was great.</i>

710
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,514
Think maybe I should pack.

711
00:47:43,716 --> 00:47:46,025
- Guess you'll be movin' in with me.
- Thanks.

712
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:49,308
Look at the bright side.
You won't have to dust anymore.

Here's your diet plate.

715
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:05,029
- Thank you.
- Does everything come with a head?

716
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:07,192
You bet, honey.

717
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:09,387
Glad I didn't order a hamburger.

Are you religious?

720

I believe in a God
that doesn't need heavy financing.

00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,752
- How you doin', Mr Barbour?
- How's it goin'?

722
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:23,551
Fine, fine.
This here's Mr Fletcher.

723
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:26,510
He's the new owner of Belle Isle,
or what's left of it.

724
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:29,277
Yeah, I heard about your fire.
Sorry about that.

You know, you've had your share of

You ever been on a coon hunt?

all the fancy clothes and music,
all the beautiful women.

- The dogs do most of the work.

Big bucks. You catch a coon?

I was shot at.
Somebody's sure trying to scare me off.

773

And they'd kill me

- Yep. Now, who would do that?

Is it the Farnsworth Ministry?

816
00:55:27,648 --> 00:55:30,640
Why would you say that?
And who is shooting at you?

817
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:32,645
Maybe the Reverend Farnsworth.

818
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:36,242
Look, Jimmy Lee Farnsworth
may be a lot of things,

819
00:55:36,448 --> 00:55:38,245
but he's not a murderer.

820
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:40,200
You're right, he is many things.

821
00:55:40,408 --> 00:55:45,483
A former used-car salesman, a confessed
embezzler, your father, square dancer.

822
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:50,728
That's right, he is my father.

823
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:52,885
But I'm also telling you the truth.

824
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:57,678
Becky, somebody wants my land
bad enough to kill me for it.

825
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:01,848
If you don't tell me who your client is,
I'm gonna find out some other way.

826
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,328
<i>[Announcer] It's guest healer's night

00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:16,641
- Excuse me. May I have your name?
- I'm Claude Henry... [mumbles]

830
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:20,000
- Claude Henry...
- Claude Henry.

831
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,724
- Claude...
- Claude or Clod is good. Henry.

832
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,885
Smmoot.

833
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,322
S-M-M-O-T-T.
I'm sorry. Two "Os", one "T".

834
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,885
- I'm a guest healer.
- Smmoot, guest healer.

835
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,762
- Yes. Healed.
- God bless you.

836
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,722
<i>With Mimsy Carlyle.</i>

837

<i>The guest healers who volunteered for
tonight's show will follow Jimmy Lee.</i>

841
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:57,169
<i>And now the founder
of our show,</i>

00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:00,602

844
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:22,642
<i>[Farnsworth] You know,</i>

845
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:27,971
<i>I have a feeling that there's someone
out there who needs to step forward.</i>

846
00:57:28,171 --> 00:57:31,004
Gordon Joe James.

847
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:35,171
<i>Gordon Joe James.
Who are you?</i>

848
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,762
Gordon Joe lost a limb
to a pit bull.

849
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:41,611
<i>Gordon Joe,
will you please raise your right hand?</i>

850
00:57:41,812 --> 00:57:44,690
<i>- Left hand.
- [Farnsworth] Excuse me, left hand.</i>

851
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:46,848
<i>[Farnsworth] There you arel</i>

852

Bibleland Two. Jimmy Lee's dream.</i>

853
00:57:57,452 --> 00:58:00,489
<i>He was like some deranged Walt Disney.</i>

<i>It was all in front of me.
Ham Johnson's place.</i>

00:58:03,372 --> 00:58:05,249
<i>His mother's bequest.</i>

<i>Belle Isle.</i>

857
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:11,331
<i>The numbers on the boxes were certainly
not zip codes. Maybe computer codes.</i>

858
00:58:11,532 --> 00:58:16,209
<i>All I needed now was a computer, and a
ten-year-old kid to teach me to use it.</i>

859
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:19,530
<i># Cash or cheque</i>

Bobby Ralph?

863
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:30,006
Peter Lemonjello.
Your house is on fire.

864
00:58:30,213 --> 00:58:33,205
- What?
- They told me to tell you.

865
00:58:33,413 --> 00:58:35,324
- I'll take over.
- God bless you!

866
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:37,603
God bless you for believing this shit.

867
00:58:47,773 --> 00:58:51,369
<i>[Fletch] There was a new element I
didn't anticipate, a second suspect.</i>

868
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:55,328
<i>Becky's client was not the ministry,
but Everest Development.</i>

869
00:58:55,534 --> 00:58:57,365
<i>She never knew who they were.</i>

870
00:58:57,574 --> 00:59:00,964
<i>Becky was a good girl, and wouldn't
have to be spanked. Damn it.</i>

<i>Who's gonna be the next one
to get the call?</i>

872
00:59:05,014 --> 00:59:07,323
<i>Who's gonna be the next one saved?</i>

873
00:59:10,494 --> 00:59:12,883
<i>- Who's going to be...
- T'Boo Ted Marshall.</i>

874
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:17,804
<i>T'Boo Ted Marshall,
are you with us tonight?</i>

875
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:21,484
<i>Yes, indeed, Reverendl
But how can God help my problem?</i>

876
00:59:21,694 --> 00:59:24,925
T'Boo Ted is a... compulsive gambler.

877
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:31,129
<i>T'Boo Ted, the first you gotta do
is expose that probleml</i>

878
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:34,093
<i>Excuse me?</i>

879
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:37,685
<i>If you can't expose that problem,
at least to your family,</i>

880

He's been a compulsive gambler
for 20 years.

883
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:50,765
<i>Because you've had this affliction
for more than 20 years...</i>

884
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:55,045
<i>I think you should
expose that problem to us</i>

885
00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:57,052
<i>right here... tonight.</i>

886
00:59:57,255 --> 01:00:01,407
<i>I want you to do it.
The good Lord wants you to do itl</i>

- I know sol</i>

<i>[announcer] Coming right back
to introduce our guest healers.</i>

893
01:00:24,736 --> 01:00:29,571
<i>Let's welcome all of them
beginning with Claude Henry Smmoot.</i>

894
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:31,687
Come on out, Claude!

895
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:34,172
- Here we are.
- I have a headache.

896
01:00:34,376 --> 01:00:35,695
No, this way.

897
01:00:38,856 --> 01:00:42,167
You're gonna do just fine.
Now, get out there. Go on.

898
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:47,567
I said, get out there now!

899
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:51,092
Here he is!
Make him welcome, folks!

900
01:00:52,377 --> 01:00:55,687
Welcome, Claude Henry.
When was the very first time,

901
01:00:55,897 --> 01:01:00,448
the very first moment
that made the difference in your life?

902
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:04,375
Well, Jimmy Lee, I was... I was, er...

903
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:08,570
on my gazebo,
on the roof making some repairs,

904
01:01:08,777 --> 01:01:11,974
and I was struck by lightning.

905
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:15,726
I have had acute migraine headaches
and blurred vision since then.

906
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:18,531
But praise the Lord,
that was my lucky day because

907
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:21,411
ever since then I have had
the healing power.

908
01:01:21,618 --> 01:01:24,610
Amen. God bless you.
Thank you very much. Good night.

909
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:27,616
- Claude Henry.
- Good night. What happened?

910
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,934
Before you heal another,

911
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:33,289
would you like for me to attempt
to heal your own affliction?

912
01:01:33,498 --> 01:01:37,047
No, no! No, no.
No, those of us with perfect faith

913
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:39,374
have no need of perfect vision.

914
01:01:39,578 --> 01:01:41,489
We have no need of wisdom.

915
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,532
We have no need of anything except
the creature comforts and lots of them.

916
01:01:45,738 --> 01:01:49,651
Hallelujah! Amen! God bless you. Amen.
Thank you. Hallelujah.

917
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:54,136
Ladies and gentlemen,
he sees more than he doth know.

918
01:01:54,338 --> 01:01:56,294
- Yes, I do.
- [audience] Amen!

919
01:01:56,498 --> 01:01:58,774
Claude Henry has the gift!

920
01:01:59,859 --> 01:02:04,091
Would you use that gift, Claude Henry?
Would you use it now?

921
01:02:07,939 --> 01:02:09,816
I guess I could.

922
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:11,975
Praise be.

923
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:16,328
Reverend,
I sense that in our audience

924
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:20,168
there is a gentleman
by the name of Jim Bob.

925
01:02:20,379 --> 01:02:23,371
Jim Bob, would you stand up?
Would you rise, please?

926
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:27,932
Sixteen, seventeen...

927
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:32,291
I sense that Jim Bob is a young man.

928
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:37,449
That he is between the ages of 25, 27.

929
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,169
That's more like it.

930
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,611
The Lord is telling me
that Jim Bob suffers from the same...

931
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,328
Satanised affliction that I suffer from.
Migraine headaches.

932
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,293
Don't you, Jim Bob?
Is that you?

933
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,536
Come on down, Jim Bob!

934
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,777
Praise be! Hallelujah! Amen!

935
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,175
Praise the Lord! Be saved!

936
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,575
Jim Bob, welcome.
God bless you.

937
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,216
Jim Bob, how long have
you had these headaches?

938
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,539
- About five, 10 minutes.
- God... help him!

939
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:16,019
- And how do you feel now?
- It's a throbbing...

940
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:19,133
God bless you.
A headache comes up through your heels,

941
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:22,413
up through the hip bone,
up the spine, up through your back,

942
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:25,499
through your head
like Satan was belching through you?

943
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,134
- Is that it?
- Exactly.

944
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:28,979
- Do you believe?
- I believe.

945
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:34,255
He believes! Hallelujah! Amen!
God bless. Amen.

946
01:03:34,461 --> 01:03:37,453
Hallelujah. [pants]

947
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:44,097
Rid this man of these headache demons,
of these migraine demons.

948
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:46,610
Heal this man!

949
01:03:47,981 --> 01:03:50,655
- Amen!
- Amen!

950
01:03:50,862 --> 01:03:53,979
Hallelujah!
Oh, good golly, Miss Molly!

951
01:03:54,182 --> 01:03:56,537
- How do you feel?
- My headache is gone, but...

952
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:58,972
God bless him! Anything else I can do?

953
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:03,016
- No! No.
- Good! God bless you. Praise be.

954
01:04:03,222 --> 01:04:07,659
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.
Ouch!

955
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:11,298
I am worn to the bone.

956
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:13,891
Thank you for gracing us
with your presence.

957
01:04:14,102 --> 01:04:16,252
Good night. Praise be!

958
01:04:19,582 --> 01:04:21,857
<i>[Fletch]
Maybe I was wrong about Farnsworth.</i>

959
01:04:22,062 --> 01:04:25,452
<i>There was a new player in the game.
Becky's unknown client.</i>

960
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:28,541
<i>The only way to find out more
was to get into her pants...</i>

961
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:33,339
<i>I mean, her car. At least it had brakes.
Her car, that is.</i>

962
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:36,262
Fletch, what are you doing?

963
01:04:36,463 --> 01:04:38,658
The guy who works in there
stole my watch.

964
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:42,697
He dropped it while trying to kill me.
I'd just as soon he not recognize me.

965
01:04:42,903 --> 01:04:46,816
I'd like to keep an eye on him.
Maybe he'll lead us to his boss.

966
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:51,014
- How long are we gonna be here?
- Bored?

967
01:04:51,223 --> 01:04:53,612
Oh, no! This is exciting!

968
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,582
- Fletch?
- What?

969
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:08,139
I have to pee.

970
01:05:08,344 --> 01:05:11,017
This used to happen
when I'd play hide-and-seek.

971
01:05:11,224 --> 01:05:14,216
I always got caught.
Think the morgue has a ladies' room?

972
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:16,619
- [engine revs]
- [Becky] Hey.

973
01:05:26,344 --> 01:05:30,223
Not so close. Try to get
a little distance between you.

974
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:08,698
I'm gonna have to play it pretty tough
in there. Still have to pee?

975
01:06:09,905 --> 01:06:12,465
I gather the rain isn't helping a lot.

976
01:06:12,665 --> 01:06:15,418
- There's always the bushes.
- I'll be OK.

977
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:20,935
If I'm not back in five minutes,
call your dad.

- Well, my granddaddy started it.

- No shit.

- '78 XL.

1079

- I can't read...

That's typical of a large corporation.

Lack of communication.
That's why I like to keep Everest small.

I've had a hernia operation.

1094
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,794
- Is that the stuff I'm getting?
- [Duke] Yes, sir.

1095
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,752
Why are they wearing those suits?

1096
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,669
They're protective. As you know,
that's a very corrosive by-product.

1097
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,111
I guess if they didn't wear them,
they'd be so full of holes,

1098
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,276
they'd whistle when they walked.

Let me see that.

1107
01:15:43,761 --> 01:15:47,595
Takes a big man to admit
when he's wrong. I am not a big man.

1108

We're late again, because
you had to stay late at the jail.

1109
01:15:57,881 --> 01:16:00,270

- Just get out.

1111
01:16:09,761 --> 01:16:13,117
- [woman] You're wrecking my present.
- [man] My fault?

1112
01:16:14,881 --> 01:16:17,396

let's not forget
our real purpose here tonight.

1117

To preserve the legacy
that nature has given us.

1118
01:16:31,722 --> 01:16:34,236
We are mere custodians of...

What are you doin' here?

1124
01:17:13,923 --> 01:17:16,562
You know me.
I ain't happy unless I'm working.

1125
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:21,359
Why, Fletch, I'm surprised to see you
here, sir. Welcome, sir, welcome.

1126
01:17:21,563 --> 01:17:24,316
My pleasure.
Thank you for not inviting me.

1127
01:17:24,523 --> 01:17:26,559
Oh!

1128
01:17:28,723 --> 01:17:30,919
I do believe we have
something to discuss.

1129
01:17:31,124 --> 01:17:35,959
Oh. Well, might I suggest
we repair ourselves to a quieter place.

1130
01:17:36,164 --> 01:17:38,280
Let us remove ourselves,
shall we?

1131
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:41,954
Son of a gun,
we'll have big fun on the bayou.

1132
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:49,360
My mama's room.

1133
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:54,559
I've kept it just the way it was
when she died.

1134
01:17:56,044 --> 01:17:58,399
Her ashes?

1135
01:17:58,604 --> 01:18:01,994
She used to say, "We come from the earth
and we return to the earth,

1136
01:18:02,204 --> 01:18:04,479
and in between, we garden."

1137
01:18:04,684 --> 01:18:07,562
[chuckles] A little gardening...

1138
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:10,641
a little polluting.

1139
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:17,075
They spelled my name wrong.

1140
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:21,593
My gun's made of rubber.
How 'bout yours?

1141
01:18:22,485 --> 01:18:27,957
No. I see your point. Wouldn't do
for your conservationist guests

1142
01:18:28,165 --> 01:18:31,874
to hear about that load of toxic waste
heading for my land at Belle Isle.

1143
01:18:32,085 --> 01:18:35,157
My land... at Belle Isle, Fletch.

1144
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:39,244
After you die, who's gonna prove that
you did not sell your land to Everest?

1145
01:18:39,445 --> 01:18:41,879
You may have this town
in your back pocket,

1146
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:44,804
but a lot of people downstairs
will be interested

1147
01:18:45,005 --> 01:18:48,203
in the hows and whys
of Amanda Ray's death.

1148
01:18:48,406 --> 01:18:50,522
She knew about Bluebird.

1149
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,001
She started a file on you,
and you found out.

1150
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:58,121
That was my lucky night. I found the
Bluebird file, the night you porked her.

1151
01:18:58,326 --> 01:19:02,478
It was like an alligator shoot on the
freeway, if you'll excuse the metaphor.

1152
01:19:02,686 --> 01:19:06,076
- It's not a metaphor, it's a simile.
- Whatever.

1153
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:11,764
You poisoned Amanda, figuring I'd sell
and leave if I faced a murder charge.

1154
01:19:11,966 --> 01:19:15,322
- I don't scare easy. I'm too dumb.
- So it would seem.

1155
01:19:15,526 --> 01:19:19,235
Now get out of my mama's chair before
I put the first bullet up your nose.

1156
01:19:19,446 --> 01:19:21,437
Are you kidding?

1157
01:19:21,646 --> 01:19:24,241
Pull that trigger
and 100 people will be up here.

1158
01:19:24,447 --> 01:19:27,245
My dear boy,
why would I do my own dirty work?

1159
01:19:28,687 --> 01:19:34,205
Those 100 do-gooders down there
dressed in rebel crap will be my alibi.

1160
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:38,123
Now get outta my mama's chair!

1161
01:19:38,327 --> 01:19:41,637
I synchronized my Laker watch
with Miss Culpepper's Timex.

1162
01:19:41,847 --> 01:19:43,803
If I don't join her in 10 minutes,

1163
01:19:44,007 --> 01:19:47,556
the whole ugly story goes out
on the Farnsworth Network.

1164
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:49,644
Of course, it's cable, but...

1165
01:19:49,847 --> 01:19:52,042
- You're bluffing, Fletch.
- No, I'm not.

1166
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:55,000
You think you're not,
but you are.

1167
01:19:58,247 --> 01:20:00,204
Swell.

1168
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:04,924
- Did he hurt you?
- Not yet. That comes later.

1169
01:20:05,928 --> 01:20:06,883
Sorry, Becky.

1170
01:20:07,088 --> 01:20:11,764
The band won't take a break for some
time, so screaming would be futile.

1171
01:20:11,968 --> 01:20:14,687
Mr Fletch's convenient appearance
has allowed us

1172
01:20:14,888 --> 01:20:19,882
to move up our plans for your demise
to coincide with his.

1173
01:20:20,088 --> 01:20:24,525
Now I'm goin' downstairs
to be the gracious host.

1174
01:20:24,728 --> 01:20:26,684
Do what you have to do.

1175
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:31,326
- The Bride of Frankenstein.
- Put my mama down!

1176
01:20:31,528 --> 01:20:33,246
Oh, I'm sorry.

1177
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:35,723
Oh, how clumsy of me.

1178
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:39,399
Oops! I'm sorry.
I stepped right on her moustache.

1179
01:20:39,609 --> 01:20:42,601
Get away! Get away!

1180
01:20:42,809 --> 01:20:45,482
- I was just trying to help.
- It's all right, Mama.

1181
01:20:45,689 --> 01:20:47,725
Be more careful with your breakables.

1182
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:50,159
I've been careful all my life.

1183
01:20:50,369 --> 01:20:52,325
When she was sick,
I was careful.

1184
01:20:52,529 --> 01:20:56,522
Then that goddamn Jimmy Lee's
Ministry, taking everything she had.

1185
01:20:56,729 --> 01:20:58,685
Bloodsuckers!

1186
01:20:59,769 --> 01:21:03,205
It's gonna be all right, Mama.
And when we're far, far away...

1187
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:05,479
from this godforsaken chemical swamp,

1188
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:09,921
we're gonna sit back
and watch 'em all just decompose.

1189
01:21:10,129 --> 01:21:13,838
That'll be good for Bibleland,
their customers glowing in the dark.

1190
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:16,769
I hope they all fry in hell!

1191
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:20,007
- You bloodsucking bastards!
- Isn't this interesting?

1192
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:21,962
- Put that down.
- She is in there.

1193
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:24,559
- Put that down.
- She's lost a little weight.

1194
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:27,728
I thought you had her
stuffed and mounted. Head's up!

1195
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,648
- Ohh!
- Becky!

1196
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:44,808
Swine...
Darryl, are you having a good time?

1197
01:22:03,651 --> 01:22:06,370
[scream, ghostly laugh]

1198
01:22:14,651 --> 01:22:16,164
[gasps]

1199
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:22,562
[screams]

1200
01:22:27,171 --> 01:22:30,289
[man] Welcome to great Noah's Ark,

1201
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:34,121
where we have a flood every 10 minutes.

1202
01:22:35,452 --> 01:22:37,807
- In the...
- [water gushes]

1203
01:22:43,652 --> 01:22:44,880
[screams]

1204
01:22:45,292 --> 01:22:46,805
No! This way.

1205
01:22:47,012 --> 01:22:49,446
[Farnsworth] Join our pyramid of prayer.

1206
01:22:49,652 --> 01:22:55,170
For only $12, you begin
your exciting journey up the pyramid.

1207
01:22:55,372 --> 01:23:01,288
And when you reach the top, you're gonna
be the target of 20,000 prayers!

1208
01:23:01,492 --> 01:23:03,005
[all] Amen!

1209
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:07,650
A lady in Fargo broke the chain
and began a five-day fit of sneezing

1210
01:23:07,853 --> 01:23:09,809
- that ended in her death.
- Daddy?

1211
01:23:10,013 --> 01:23:15,326
Well, Mr Fletcher, what a pleasant
surprise. And, Becky, what are you...

1212
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:19,446
Look who's here! Hamilton Johnson!
Friend of the community.

1213
01:23:19,653 --> 01:23:22,804
Ham, you look like you've
worked up quite a sweat.

1214
01:23:23,013 --> 01:23:25,208
You should dry your hair.
Want a towel?

1215
01:23:25,413 --> 01:23:28,564
- [gasps]
- Uh-oh, he's got a gun.

1216
01:23:28,773 --> 01:23:31,412
Show your lovely face
on national television.

1217
01:23:31,613 --> 01:23:35,367
Let 'em see that greedy glint in your
eye and hear that bullshit chuckle.

1218
01:23:35,573 --> 01:23:37,370
Who's gonna save you now, Fletch?

1219
01:23:37,573 --> 01:23:40,292
You'll have to shoot through me,
you son of a bitch!

1220
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:43,690
He's not gonna shoot anybody.
Are you? You're on television.

1221
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,010
You haven't got the guts.

1222
01:23:46,214 --> 01:23:48,682
- My mistake.
- Freeze!

1223
01:23:48,894 --> 01:23:52,853
FBI. Drop the gun!
I said, drop it. Harry!

1224
01:24:00,654 --> 01:24:05,364
And it's my plan to rerun this incident
every night during Sweeps Week.

1225
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:08,407
The obvious question is,
what did you know and when?

1226
01:24:08,614 --> 01:24:10,809
How long would you let me
twist in the wind?

1227
01:24:11,014 --> 01:24:14,324
Up to a point. The Agency was
barking up the same tree you were.

1228
01:24:14,534 --> 01:24:17,048
- Jimmy Lee's finances.
- Yep.

1229
01:24:17,254 --> 01:24:20,644
Harry and Field Officer Vincent
infiltrated the Ministry.

1230
01:24:20,854 --> 01:24:22,811
Field Officer Vincent?

1231
01:24:23,015 --> 01:24:25,324
That's Mr Coco's real name.

1232
01:24:25,535 --> 01:24:28,049
We've been working
on this case for over a year.

1233
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:31,565
Excuse me, Agent Goldstein,
can the officer speak to you?

1234
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,812
- Surely.
- Goldstein?

1235
01:24:38,895 --> 01:24:41,329
[reporter] Thank you, sir.

1236
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:44,095
Ding dong,
the wicked witch is dead.

1237
01:24:44,295 --> 01:24:47,605
So what's next, Fletch?
Back to LA?

1238
01:24:47,815 --> 01:24:49,726
There's no place like home.

1239
01:24:49,935 --> 01:24:51,971
Unless home is here.

1240
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:55,770
You know what? We gotta get you
away from this chemical swamp.

1241
01:24:55,975 --> 01:24:57,931
I was wondering, do you like smog?

1242
01:25:01,216 --> 01:25:03,969
<i>[Fletch] Back home
there was a surprise party for me.</i>

1243
01:25:04,176 --> 01:25:07,725
<i>But the nicest surprise was an insurance
cheque for the Belle Isle fire.</i>

1244
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,130
<i>$100,000.</i>

1245
01:25:09,336 --> 01:25:13,693
<i>No one stopped Bly Bio Chem from
dumping that toxic waste on my land.</i>

1246
01:25:13,896 --> 01:25:18,208
<i>They told me not to worry. Its half-life
was estimated at 3,000 years.</i>

1247
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:20,168
Everything OK, Fletch?

1248
01:25:20,376 --> 01:25:22,936
Betty was pissed off
about giving up her office,

1249
01:25:23,136 --> 01:25:25,650
and Accounting gave me flak
about the new car.

1250
01:25:25,856 --> 01:25:29,132
Everything's gonna be just the way
you want it, maybe better.

1251
01:25:29,336 --> 01:25:31,292
I like your attitude, Frank.

1252
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:34,806
- Excuse me just a sec.
- What a guy!

1253
01:25:36,857 --> 01:25:41,214
I thought I told you...
never to come to my workplace.

1254
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,248
Time's change, my dear Fletch.

1255
01:25:43,457 --> 01:25:46,654
Rumour has it that you inherited
a sizable piece of property.

1256
01:25:46,857 --> 01:25:50,770
- Who told you?
- I have my sources too.

1257
01:25:50,977 --> 01:25:54,287
They suggest you may
have been considering skipping town

1258
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:56,488
and retiring on this vast estate.

1259
01:25:56,697 --> 01:25:59,336
Thus skipping out
on your responsibilities.

1260
01:25:59,537 --> 01:26:03,735
- Would I do that?
- Wendy could probably get half of it.

1261
01:26:03,937 --> 01:26:08,374
So in return for the other half,
we would forego any other claims.

1262
01:26:09,257 --> 01:26:12,329
Think about it.
You would never see me again.

1263
01:26:17,178 --> 01:26:19,134
Where do I sign?

1264
01:26:24,018 --> 01:26:26,134
- I'll never see you again?
- Never.

1265
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:34,090
You realize this is my family land?

1266
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:37,852
Does it please you
to rip out my ancestral roots?

1267
01:26:38,058 --> 01:26:41,130
I was born and raised in a briar patch.

1268
01:26:49,778 --> 01:26:52,247
Now Wendy can live a life of leisure.

1269
01:26:52,459 --> 01:26:56,850
Clean air, clean water. This is the way
she was destined to live.

1270
01:26:57,699 --> 01:27:00,497
OK, Gillet. You've broken me.

1271
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:02,530
I hope you're happy.

1272
