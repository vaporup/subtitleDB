1
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Taito was founded 60 years ago.

2
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,290
We started as an import goods company.

3
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,700
We would bring in items from 
overseas like Pinball Games.

4
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Our president then decided that arcades

5
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,200
seemed to be working well in America,

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,700
and that they would suit 
Japan equally well.

7
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
We created our first arcade store 
and it was a success.

8
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,700
That made us say, why don't we 
start making our own games?

9
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,250
1978,

10
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,250
Space Invaders was born.

11
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,750
The programmer and Director 
of the game was Nishikado.

12
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,080
In a standard arcade there 
were Space Invader cabinets

13
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,080
and various other games, 
usually around fifty

14
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,580
to one hundred games 
throughout the arcade.

15
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,080
but customers really only 
wanted to play Space Invaders

16
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,580
and the other games 
were only taking up space

17
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,080
so we decided to make arcades 
with only Space Invader cabinets

18
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,580
these became known as Invader Houses.

19
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,080
it turned out to be a great idea.

20
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,580
A game of Space Invaders cost 
a single 100 yen coin per play

21
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,080
and customers would pump 
their coins into the machines

22
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,580
spending hundreds of coins 
per person, every day.

23
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,080
It became such an epidemic that Japan

24
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,080
actually ran out of 100 yen coins.

25
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,080
Historical records show that

26
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080
while the banks did their best to keep up

27
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
they couldn't print coins fast enough

28
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,080
causing this incredible shortage.

29
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,910
Of course shooting games 
are my first love.

30
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,410
Instead of a human 
running around with a gun,

31
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,910
we have these futuristic 
space ships shooting aliens.

32
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,910
That idea alone was so new

33
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,910
and such a romantic concept.

34
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,410
Of course Space Invaders is one of

35
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,410
the most recognized Japanese games.

36
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,410
but when you mention the word game

37
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,910
to someone who grew up at the time,

38
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,910
they immediately think of a space ship

39
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,910
moving across the x and y axis' 
and shooting bullets.

40
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,620
Hi, I'm the owner of Game-Inn Ebisen.

41
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,120
Ebihara-san aka The Shrimp Boss.

42
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,120
This isn't your standard 
Japanese Arcade,

43
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
we don't have modern 
mainstream games,

44
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,620
it's more of a retro arcade

45
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,620
we focus more on the retro games.

46
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,120
I also provide a service

47
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,120
where you choose the game 
you would like to play

48
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,370
and i'll swap it out in the machine.

49
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,120
At my arcade, vertical and 
side scrolling shooting games

50
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,620
are the most popular, other than those...

51
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,870
maybe just Tetris.

52
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,000
Basically the people who play here,

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,500
I'd say about 90 percent...

54
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
90 percent of my customers

55
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
are hardcore...

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,580
Hardcore gamers.

57
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,580
My alias is Clover-TAC

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,500
I pretty much just play 
shooting games.

59
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,500
The idea behind shooting games,

60
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,000
which of course was born 
from Space Invaders,

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,500
are based on a concept 
that is easy to understand

62
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
anyone who is watching can see

63
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,000
you shoot bullets to hit your enemies

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and then at the same time

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
if you are hit by a bullet 
you explode, ending the game.

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
These rules haven't changed 
since shooting games' inception.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,500
It is these simple rules

68
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,000
and ease of comprehension

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that have kept these games popular

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,500
for so many years.

71
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,580
'That's good enough'

72
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
doesn't exist in these guys' vocabulary

73
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,580
down to the last detail, 
they keep fighting.

74
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,580
Of course I feel a lot 
of pressure to succeed

75
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,580
but once the game starts 
the nerves disappear.

76
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,080
Not only that

77
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,580
but you can only reach your 
peak performance from experience,

78
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,080
it's similar to a test you've 
been studying for in school

79
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,580
you can't suddenly start playing 
these games and be amazing.

80
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,580
It just won't happen like that, 
you need to work up your skill level

81
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,080
to become good at these games.

82
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,540
Lately, you know...

83
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,040
How do you say...

84
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,040
the best shooting game players

85
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,540
don't necessarily have 
insane reactionary reflexes

86
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,540
instead it's more about 
logical thinking and strategy

87
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,540
that's more the norm now, 
more the focus.

88
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,110
Find your strategy and 
keep building and

89
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,040
building and building on that foundation.

90
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,540
After all that, you can't just wait 
for a perfect score to arrive

91
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,540
you have to want it 
and push for it to happen.

92
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,540
It is this type of mindset 
that these players all maintain

93
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,540
especially someone like Clover-TAC.

94
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Of course...

95
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,500
Of course I remember the first time 
Clover-TAC came to Ebi-sen.

96
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Naru-kun, a top player...

97
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
A really good shooting game player 
who frequents this arcade...

98
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,000
He was the one who 
brought Clover-TAC along

99
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
and right from the beginning 
I could see...

100
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
this guy was really good.

101
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Ahh... this guy... there's 
something different about this guy.

102
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,500
I believe the first time that I had 
one of my high scores published

103
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
was a score from a game 
called ESP Ra. De.

104
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,000
My scores now, at least compared 
to my first published high score,

105
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,500
while I've gotten much higher scores since,

106
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,500
that first published score is the one 
that i'm the most proud of.

107
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,000
The one that I remember the most fondly.

108
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Most recently my best score 
is from the game "Akai Katana"

109
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,500
about 430,000,000 points.

110
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,540
When thinking about arcade games 
and their design

111
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
you must consider that you 
put in your 100 yen coin

112
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,040
the game begins and 
the arcade gets its profit.

113
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,040
So the user is paying for 
a chance to enjoy a game.

114
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Paying for time.

115
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,040
They get X amount of gameplay minutes.

116
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,540
So with that in mind, one game 
should be able to be completed

117
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,040
within about 30 minutes.

118
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
One other thing is, for the person
who deposited their 100 yen coin

119
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,540
in simple terms, there needs 
to be some kind of satisfaction

120
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,040
within the first one to 
three minutes of gameplay.

121
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040
For this reason, RPG style 
adventure games with long stories

122
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
where you work towards 
getting to the final boss

123
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,540
and numerous events take place in between,

124
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
this style of game just doesn't work, 
it's N.G. (no good).

125
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,040
Within the first three minutes... 
At about the three minute mark

126
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,540
the player needs to understand

127
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,540
this is how the gameplay works, 
these are the game's mechanics.

128
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,040
So the game needs to have 
a sudden and exciting climax

129
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,540
and then from there, once 
the player has reached this climax,

130
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
if they are like "I'm done, 
I get it, I'm finished playing".

131
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,040
The game has failed.

132
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
"I want to do that again!"

133
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,540
Even though they've experienced the climax

134
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,040
they should want to get to that climax again

135
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,540
without feeling they've 
experienced the entire game.

136
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
There's still so much more to do!

137
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,540
These principles must be present 
for an arcade game

138
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,540
to be successful.

139
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,540
It is these principles we consider 
when designing a game.

140
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,290
Up until now, arcade games 
had always been a business model

141
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,790
that in an interesting way, 
has been about purchasing time.

142
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,790
We'll take your 100 yen and 
give you three minutes of entertainment

143
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,290
and that was our hobby at the time.

144
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,790
But then this is where 
things started to shift.

145
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,790
You and the person beside you 
each pay 100 yen to fight

146
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,290
if you lose we take your money! 
That's frustrating isn't it?

147
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,790
Better out in some more money.

148
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,790
Until now this type of hobby didn't exist.

149
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,790
Once you tried it, 
you realized how fun it was.

150
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,790
This new game-type caused 
arcade business to surge.

151
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,790
So when you look at Street Fighter 2

152
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,790
in the grand scheme of arcade game history.

153
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,290
Fighting games would be 
like the proverbial meteor

154
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,790
that wiped out the dinosaurs.

155
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,290
Street Fighter 2 would act as 
the catalyst that would overthrow

156
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,290
my favorite genre: shooting games

157
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,790
as the number one draw to arcades...

158
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,790
This would represent the first major 
paradigm shift for arcades.

159
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,250
The reason I like fighting games, 
is it's such a fresh concept.

160
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,750
it's not simply a physical challenge, 
the mental aspects

161
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,750
known as Yomi, which involves 
"reading" your opponent

162
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,750
didn't exist in games before this.

163
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,250
I thought, hmm... This is 
a thinking mans game

164
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,250
and that's what really 
attracted me to fighting games.

165
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,750
That and I thought if I could 
make some friends when

166
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,750
playing these games, it would 
become even more interesting.

167
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,250
Basically, if you think about Fighting Games

168
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,250
as a communication tool 
you won't be far off.

169
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,750
I've been playing games for so long...

170
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,750
I don't know if you can call it 
a hobby anymore.

171
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,750
The first time I played games

172
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,250
was at a video rental store.

173
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,250
It was there, when I went 
with my sister to rent a movie

174
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,500
that I had my first experience 
with arcade games.

175
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,750
From the age of fourteen until twenty...

176
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:41,750
About twenty-two, I was playing 
pretty much non-stop.

177
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:48,250
From twenty-three through to 
twenty-seven, I ddin't really play much.

178
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,250
With the release of Street Fighter 4

179
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,750
I returned to playing very frequently.

180
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,700
In 2D fighting games, without a doubt

181
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,200
the best player is Daigo Umehara,

182
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
He has a long storied career 
in fighting games

183
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
and has travelled overseas 
for many tournaments.

184
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
How can I say...

185
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
He has one of the best records 
in fighting games

186
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
and is universally considered one of 
the best players in the world.

187
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Without a doubt, for 2D fighters

188
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Umehara is the best.

189
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,750
The social interaction 
between two people

190
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,750
is what this is really all about.

191
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,750
It's not about the 
Artificial Intelligence of a computer

192
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,250
I think that's the most interesting 
aspect of fighting games.

193
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,750
It's hard to say for sure 
what makes me a good player

194
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,750
but I'm sure it has something 
to do with an innate understanding

195
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,250
of these types of games 
since I was very young.

196
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,250
That's really the sense of a pro gamer.

197
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,250
That being said, natural ability 
only gets you so far...

198
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,250
It all comes down to playing these games

199
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,250
and putting in the time, 
the repetition, the practice...

200
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,750
That's where I feel professional 
level skill comes from.

201
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,750
In one month... When I was younger,

202
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,750
at the arcade...

203
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,750
I'd spend about $600 a month.

204
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
When I was playing the most, 
in one week,

205
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,250
I would go to an arcade... Everday.

206
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,750
When I was younger I 
would get really nervous,

207
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,250
my hands would shake from nerves

208
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,750
and it would really affect my gameplay.

209
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,750
But by the time I turned 
about... Seventeen...

210
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,750
Once I was around that age 
I really didn't get nervous.

211
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,250
Even in big tournaments, 
I could perform fairly well.

212
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,250
Now in tournaments or whenever, 
I'm really not nervous at all.

213
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,790
Right. If I watch a tape 
of myself playing a match,

214
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,790
sometimes if I watch my...

215
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,790
When I'm playing if you watch my face,

216
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,790
people often comment that I look scary.

217
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,790
Why...

218
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,790
Why is that?

219
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,290
When I was a kid,

220
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,790
I didn't really show my emotions...

221
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,290
I was the type of kid who 
doesn't show their emotions.

222
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:57,290
So I guess that just kind of 
carried over into my playstyle as well.

223
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,290
Daigo Umehara is well...

224
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,790
He's not necessarily better 
than others at these games,

225
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,790
he's better at working hard,

226
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,790
to become the best.

227
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,290
It's that quality that makes Umehara

228
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,790
a unique and strong player.

229
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,790
To become a skilled player,

230
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,790
practicing at the arcades is your best bet.

231
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,790
The reason I say this

232
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,790
is the fact that each game in 
an arcade costs you real money.

233
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,290
Because of this, 
you treat the game differently,

234
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,290
you consider things more, 
you try harder.

235
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,790
Whereas with console games for example,

236
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,290
you can lose and it doesn't really matter,

237
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,790
you don't really care, I think.

238
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,290
You won't see that type 
of mindset in an arcade,

239
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,790
people take it a lot more seriously.

240
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,290
For those reasons

241
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,790
practicing in an arcade 
is more serious as well.

242
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,370
Japanese homes are very small.

243
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,870
So you can't make noise or 
party without getting complaints.

244
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,870
It's much more common for 
friends to meet up at arcades

245
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,870
where you can let loose and have fun.

246
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,370
Japanese arcades are loud, 
but I mean that in a good way

247
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,370
loud and exciting.

248
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,370
The people that I hang out with,

249
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,870
they of course love to play games,

250
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,870
but mostly come to arcades 
to be with their friends.

251
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,370
There's regular groups of people 
who all come to the arcades,

252
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,370
which gives them a chance 
to meet up more often

253
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,870
and I think that's true for 
most people who frequent

254
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,870
the arcades in Japan.

255
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,870
I imagine that, that is 
one of the main differences

256
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,870
between Japan's and 
foreign countries' arcades.

257
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,870
When I was working at an arcade,

258
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,870
well, at that time...

259
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,870
arcade friends... What I mean to say is...

260
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,370
Friends I made by playing games 
together at arcades,

261
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,870
are people that you become very close with.

262
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,370
And... Well... Actually...

263
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,370
I married my best friend that I met there.

264
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,870
The arcades that I've seen the most of,

265
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,370
the ones with a serious 
fighting game atmosphere...

266
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,870
They really serve many different purposes.

267
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,870
For example, they are a place to meet friends

268
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,370
and play together, a social place.

269
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,370
They are also a place to 
find stronger players regularly

270
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,870
and try to beat them to improve your game.

271
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,870
Not only that, but they hold lots of events

272
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,870
and if I want to practice, 
it facilitates that as well.

273
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,370
There are just so many 
different purposes to these arcades.

274
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:47,870
To put it simply, if you like attending 
events and want to socialize,

275
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,370
to make new friends... 
Or more specifically what we call...

276
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,370
Fighting game friends,

277
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,870
your training partner for these games

278
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,870
then it's really all about 
connecting with other players.

279
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,870
That's the kind of atmosphere 
you can expect in an arcade.

280
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,370
It can be a fairly hardcore atmosphere...

281
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,370
Around things like 
UFO catchers or easier games,

282
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,870
maybe not so much...

283
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,870
Around fighting games, 
and other challenging games,

284
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,870
at least around me, it's definitely 
a more hardcore atmosphere.

285
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,370
A little more serious I think.

286
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,370
I work for Sega as a sound designer. 
My name is Hiro.

287
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:55,870
I'm in charge of creating the 
music for various arcade games,

288
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,870
Most of the titles I'm known for came out

289
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,870
about 20 years ago.

290
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,370
Games like Hang On and Out Run

291
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,370
or Afterburner and Space Harrier.

292
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,870
But anyways...

293
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,870
Large cabinet games that you 
sit in which move as you play,

294
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,870
these types of games were 
the ones I made the music for.

295
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,870
Recently a new genre of game has come out.

296
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,870
Until now, arcades were mostly 
fighting games or driving games,

297
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:30,370
but now there is a new genre 
that is popular in arcades.

298
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,870
With music being the main 
gameplay element for the genre,

299
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,870
it creates a whole new aspect to gaming...

300
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:43,370
A fresh and exciting take 
on the arcade experience.

301
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,870
My real name is Tomoyuki Mori,

302
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,370
my gaming alias is Akudaikan.

303
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,870
The game I'm playing most now is DDR

304
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,870
That and more recently 
a game called Horse Riders.

305
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,370
That's what I'm enjoying 
currently in the arcade.

306
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,370
At the time... I didn't know anything 
about DDR, but had seen

307
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,870
a game called Beatmania 
which was really taking off.

308
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,870
When I tried it for the 
first time I was like...

309
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,370
Ahh this is pretty interesting!

310
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,870
But my friend was like, just wait 
until you see this other game

311
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,870
and that other game 
turned out to be DDR.

312
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,870
Rather than using your fingers, 
this game is all about feet,

313
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,370
and I thought... Oh this is great!

314
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,870
That's when I decided 
that this was the game for me.

315
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
The first time that I got 
to try music games was

316
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,620
when I went to the 
Tokyo Game Show in 1999.

317
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,120
The console version of DDR 
has just been released,

318
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
so I got a chance to try that out, 
and when I did

319
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
I realized how fun and 
new this experience was.

320
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,620
That's how this all began.

321
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,330
By now there have been 
tons of versions of DDR released

322
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,830
on Xbox and Playstation, however,

323
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,830
when you think about 
the situation in Japan...

324
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,830
It's really difficult to invite 
people over to your residence

325
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,830
and replicate this kind of experience.

326
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,830
It's just completely different 
playing these games

327
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,330
at home versus in the arcade.

328
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,330
If you want to play in front of a crowd

329
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,330
you head to the arcades.

330
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,330
If you keep going to 
the same arcade to play these games

331
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,830
and continually play with 
the same group of people,

332
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,830
you can't help but become 
close friends with everyone there.

333
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,830
It was this way that I made a ton of friends

334
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,830
and got heavily involved with the community.

335
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,830
It was a great experience.

336
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,660
The same can be said for almost anything.

337
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,160
In Japanese we say "koriyakuho" which means,

338
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,660
for example, if you're attempting 
to get a marvelous [the best score]

339
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,660
there is no instruction manual 
which tells you exactly

340
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,160
how to hit each note at the 
exact "marvelous" timing.

341
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,660
Depending on the song, 
the timing for a marvelous

342
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,160
will usually be slightly different.

343
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,660
Actually, there will usually 
be at least one "feint"

344
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,660
where the marvelous timing 
will be just slightly off

345
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,660
in an attempt to confuse 
even the best players.

346
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,660
Having said all that, there is 
no way to learn these things

347
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
except for trying it out yourself.

348
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,160
After that, it's all repetition and practice,

349
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,660
until it becomes second nature 
or muscle memory.

350
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,660
I'm not sure about others, 
but I think that DDR

351
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,160
is similar to sports, 
such as Skiing or Badminton,

352
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
in the sense that you 
can continue doing them

353
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
even as you get older.

354
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,160
Even in America 
we saw DDR appear

355
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,160
in schools to help combat child obesity.

356
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
While I am fourty-four years old

357
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,660
I know people who are 
over fifty who are playing DDR.

358
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,160
There is also a well known couple 
in Japan who play DDR

359
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,660
and I believe the husband 
is over seventy years old.

360
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,160
That couple uses DDR regularly 
as an exercise tool.

361
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
It's the fact that you need 
to use your legs

362
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,160
and really your whole body 
when playing DDR...

363
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,660
In terms of a sport or activity

364
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,660
DDR is an excellent 
exercise tool in my opinion.

365
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:12,410
When chasing highscores in DDR,

366
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,410
of course you'll compete a
gainst many different players

367
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,910
and have some great battles,

368
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,910
while developing friendly rivalries

369
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,910
but the truth is, even though 
I've been trying to get highscores

370
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,410
for quite a while, I've made lots 
of good friends along the way.

371
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,910
The reason I play these games now 
is less about getting a highscore

372
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,910
and more about making friends.

373
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,200
The environment of the arcade is one where

374
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,200
background music is constantly playing.

375
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,200
With so many games strewn throughout

376
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,200
this creates a major noise pollution problem.

377
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,200
From the inception of arcades 
this has been a major issue

378
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,200
and the kind of devices 
that would solve these problems

379
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,200
would be small speakers 
placed near the ears of the player

380
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,200
or directional speakers built 
into arcade cabinets

381
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,200
allowing only you to hear 
the sounds from the machine.

382
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,200
When trying to not overly pollute 
the arcade with noise,

383
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,700
it is critical to decide when a game

384
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,700
should or should not emit 
sound effects or music

385
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,700
if all the games were constantly 
throwing out sounds

386
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,200
no one would know what to listen to.

387
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Deciding to play a sound

388
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,200
or not to play a sound

389
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,040
and either loudly

390
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,870
or softly

391
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,200
is the designers best tool

392
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,700
for shaping the users experience.

393
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
The quality of service is the 
main concern for arcades in Japan.

394
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,200
With arcades covering the country

395
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
they are always trying to appeal to passerby

396
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,700
- "Hey, you look a little low, 
why not play a few games?" -

397
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,200
always reaching out to potential customers...

398
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,700
...it is this spirit built 
on a service culture

399
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,200
that enables all of the small 
mom & pop arcades to survive.

400
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,700
In America, if you go to an arcade,

401
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,200
the owner is probably just 
standing in some corner

402
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,700
saying "yeah, sure... 
play some games or something... "

403
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,700
In Japan, the employees
 don't make any extra money

404
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,700
but their desire to provide excellent service

405
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,700
will have them asking 
"How is everything? Are you having fun?"

406
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,200
This Japanese cultural difference 
makes arcades more about

407
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,700
customer satisfaction and less about money.

408
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
While I was working at the arcade,

409
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,700
it was always a lot of fun.

410
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,700
Being able to watch games while at work

411
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,200
is the best.

412
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,700
We would always get customers coming in

413
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
who genuinely love games

414
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,700
and we would really hit it off.

415
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,700
It was great having a job

416
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,700
where you could have a 
positive influence on the clientele.

417
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,250
Near the entrance, you'll find UFO catchers

418
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,750
that's usually where 
you'll see the most customers...

419
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,750
So that's why there are always 
UFO catchers near the entrance.

420
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,750
After that you'll see...

421
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,250
Music games...

422
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,250
Beatmania

423
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,750
and Taiko no Tatsujin

424
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,250
and well, those other games 
that are for people

425
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,250
who maybe don't come to arcades as often.

426
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,750
Those games are all located 
near the entrance of the arcade.

427
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,750
And then near those games

428
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,250
you'll find large cabinet games,

429
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,750
Horse Racing games or Soccer games...

430
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,750
There's definitely a lot of 
these types of games nearby.

431
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,750
Then, as you head higher into the arcade,

432
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,250
you'll find the Medal games 
[coin based games]

433
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,750
and finally, on the top floor 
you'll find the 'intense' video games.

434
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,750
So I think that maybe, 
the people who love games,

435
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,750
head to the higher floors.

436
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,750
Whereas the people who 
don't necessarily play as much

437
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,750
will be on the first floor.

438
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,250
If you like gaming, you'll find yourself

439
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,250
heading higher and higher into the arcade.

440
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,750
That's really how these places are designed.

441
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,620
Arcades like Round 1, 
for example, are becoming

442
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,620
more and more accessible to casual gamers.

443
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,620
At first I really thought that's 
where all arcades were headed

444
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,120
but even the folks at SEGA thought

445
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,120
it would be beneficial to build arcades

446
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,120
that cater to the more casual players

447
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,120
or elderly gamers.

448
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,120
So I think current arcades are working hard

449
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,620
to appeal to a wider audience.

450
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,830
Console games have recently become

451
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,830
extremely well made

452
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,330
and higher in quality.

453
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,330
For arcades...

454
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,330
From this point on,

455
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,330
it will become difficult to build new ones.

456
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,830
This is a tough era 
for arcades to survive in.

457
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,830
Well I think that everyone was saying,

458
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,330
with the release of the Wii

459
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,830
the whole point of arcades 
has been replaced

460
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,330
and I have to admit that they are right.

461
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,330
For example, if you get 
together with your friends

462
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,330
to go bowling, instead you can 
just stay home and play Wii.

463
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,330
So I think the original purpose of the arcade

464
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,830
is essentially losing to today's consoles...

465
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,830
If you go to the arcade, 
you'll quickly understand,

466
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,330
business has become mostly 
about Purikura on the first floor

467
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,330
and the card games on the second floor.

468
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,830
These are the popular areas now.

469
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,330
When the Wii came out

470
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,330
I thought, this is the end of the arcades...

471
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,330
At least from a business stand point.

472
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,330
But I think they've changed 
from what they once were.

473
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,330
Arcades are evolving

474
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,830
and I think they'll find their place 
in today's gaming landscape.

475
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,830
Well... To be honest...

476
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,330
These small arcades like 
Ebi-sen, the one I'm in now,

477
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,830
which are independantly owned and operated

478
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:36,330
and are filled with mostly 
hardcore video games

479
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:41,330
are facing a difficult time right now 
in terms of business and profit.

480
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:45,830
It is often said that console 
gaming technology has increased,

481
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,830
they have become very 
advanced gaming systems, whereas

482
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:52,830
it used to be that only arcades 
would have the newest technology,

483
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,330
but now consoles have improved 
to such a point that they

484
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,830
have all but replaced arcade gaming...

485
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,830
And there is simply less of a reason 
to go to an arcade.

486
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,330
And then there are certain popular games

487
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:07,330
like Mahjong Fight Club 
or other elaborate titles

488
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:11,330
which are more expensive to play and maintain

489
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:15,330
and thus harder for indie arcades to own.

490
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,830
Compared to other countries 
Japan's arcades are doing well,

491
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,830
but if you compare it to ten years ago

492
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,830
then there has been an obvious decline.

493
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:28,330
Clearly crane games and 
music games will eventually

494
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,830
be what fills the arcades, I think.

495
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,830
Arcades need games that 
can only be experienced there

496
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,330
and without some kind of plan for the future

497
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:41,830
I think things like fighting games 
will disappear from arcades.

498
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:45,330
While I don't know for certain 
what the future holds,

499
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,330
obviously consoles have really evolved

500
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:53,330
and people only come to arcades 
to experience something new.

501
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,330
While perhaps one key factor 
is the social climate,

502
00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:00,830
it's more about the desire and 
excitement to try something new...

503
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,330
With the unpredictable future of technology

504
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,330
where something might come out 
that re-invigorates arcades...

505
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,330
Without something of that nature,

506
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,330
little by little, we'll see 
the arcade business decline.

507
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:48,330
While it's true that 
some arcades are struggling,

508
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,330
and while...

509
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,830
Some arcades are struggling,

510
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,830
we aren't just giving up.

511
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,830
We're looking for ways 
to attract new customers

512
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,330
and keep our current clientele 
coming back for more.

513
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,830
Everyday we're looking at new strategies 
to improve our business.

514
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,160
A new category of gaming, 
which combined card games

515
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,660
and video games was born.

516
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,660
Any time a new popular 
style of game is released,

517
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,660
especially with this type 
of synergy of genres,

518
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,160
it creates an opportunity 
to top our sales goals.

519
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,660
Our numbers...

520
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,160
Or rather our various revenue goals,

521
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,660
are obviously a large part of our business,

522
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,660
but I don't think that's very interesting.

523
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,660
Rather than focusing on numbers

524
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,160
we want to increase traffic 
to our arcades with

525
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,660
fun and exciting games...

526
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,160
And help foster the love of 
arcade culture among Japanese people.

527
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,660
This is the ultimate goal for Taito,

528
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,660
that we must pursue to 
continue growing as a company.

529
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,160
With all of this in mind

530
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,660
we are putting all our efforts 
into expanding gaming culture

531
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,160
and will do our best to continue 
to push the boundaries of arcades.

532
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,160
Japanese, you know... 
Japanese anime and manga etc...

533
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,160
Is really popular among foreigners.

534
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,660
Arcade culture on the other hand, 
hasn't caught on yet.

535
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,160
I really feel like gaming 
is a unique sub-culture...

536
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,160
Please, come experience it for yourself.

537
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,660
A rich... A rich experience 
that shouldn't lose

538
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,660
to anime or other Japanese sub-cultures.

539
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,660
Wouldn't that be great?

540
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,160
Playing games at home by yourself, 
just isn't the same.

541
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,160
Arcades allow you a glimpse 
of something bigger.

542
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,160
I implore you to come and see for yourself.

543
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,580
Evo is definitely the tournament

544
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,080
that I practice the most for...

545
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,580
The tournament that I 
want to win the most,

546
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,580
it's the one that creates 
the biggest spectacle.

547
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,580
It's the most fun.

548
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,580
It's my favorite tournament.
