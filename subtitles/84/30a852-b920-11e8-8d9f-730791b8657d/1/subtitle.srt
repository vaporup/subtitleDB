00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,858
Hey, Ji-hwan

9
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:10,725
Ji-hwan

10
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,694
yes

11
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,628
Can I have a ride to
Grand Park way junction?

12
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,428
Sure, get in

13
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,999
Working and studying
at the same time is hard, huh?

14
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,844
A little

15
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,681
You're gonna suceeed

16
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,942
At whatever you do

17
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,798
Is that you, Ji-yoon?

18
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,985
Can't you smoke
better cigarettes?

19
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,654
Even high school kids
don't smoke that

20
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,982
Or stop smoking
if you can't afford it

21
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,423
How are you such an expert?

22
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,587
By any chance...

23
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,061
Forget it

24
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,996
You have another
strange mail

25
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
No name, no address

26
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,234
Who keeps sending this?

27
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:10,372
It's cute

28
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,884
Smell something?

29
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,529
Yeah, smells like soap

30
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,868
I also want to kiss

31
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:42,212
5 years earlier

32
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,429
Start

33
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:13,675
One Two
Three Four Five!

34
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,348
Yes! Lee Ji-hwan!
New record!

35
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,422
You've finally did it

36
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,822
Ji-hwan, you're a...

37
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:09,066
Did you just take something?

38
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,333
No, it's nothing

39
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,440
Do you have
strawberry juice?

40
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,840
Yes

41
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,569
Then I'll take two, please

42
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,824
- Something wrong?
- No

43
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,463
Your eyes are really red

44
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,032
Soo-in, come inside!

45
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,528
What are you doing?

46
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,296
Just a sec

47
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,104
Wow, it's so nice

48
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,512
Chul-hyun, a girl called!

49
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,832
Hello?

50
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,232
Hello?

51
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,573
Ji-hwan,
you little bastard!

52
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,743
I'm hungry

53
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,981
- Again?
- Yeah

54
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:30,959
Excuse me

55
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:38,000
Mind if I sit with you?

56
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,918
Move over

57
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:03,166
I overheard both of you
talking earlier

58
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,567
The one with longer hair
Soo-in, right?

59
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,038
Yes

60
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,642
I'm Well, I'm not
very good with words

61
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,945
Soo-in

62
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,821
I fell in love
with you at first sight

63
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:39,902
Thanks for not laughing

64
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,136
Look so funny!

65
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,407
I'm going to the bathroom

66
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,238
- Kyung-hee
- I'm serious

67
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:51,577
Good luck

68
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,154
Let me be honest

69
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,793
I'm really sorry
for telling you this...

70
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,564
Ji-hwan Lee Ji-hwan

71
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,603
Yes

72
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,845
But you're making me
feel quite uncomfortable

73
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:28,883
uncomfortable, uncomfortable
Not comfortable

74
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,091
Here's a note for you
from that guy

75
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:47,830
What? What's that?

76
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,616
I turned the clock
back an hour

77
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,351
I turned the clock
back an hour

78
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,957
I wish you'd forget
everything I said

79
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,957
But if we run into
each other next time,

80
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,930
let's meet as friends then

81
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,479
I'm gonna leave for now,

82
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,281
but we'll meet again

83
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,584
We'll meet for sure

84
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,462
I'm Ji-hwan
Lee Ji-hwan

85
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,930
Remember my name, okay?
You're Soo-in

86
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,732
And you're...
What's your name?

87
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,167
Kyung-hee
Kim Kyung-hee

88
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,607
Right, Kyung-hee

89
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,440
Soo-in and Kyung-hee

90
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,910
Next time we meet,
we'll be friends, okay?

91
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,710
okay, see you later

92
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,228
Kyung-hee

93
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,360
Sleep over tonight

94
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,136
I snuck out,

95
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,203
so dad might get mad at me

96
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,465
Okay

97
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:30,866
Will it be okay with you?

98
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,876
Whose friend am I?
I'll just call home Let's go

99
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,786
I told you
not to be so nice

100
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,130
not to be so nice
wash mine anyway

101
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,194
What are you doing?

102
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,291
Oh, this?

103
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,172
I heard this makes
Your breasts bigger

104
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:03,766
Wanna try?

105
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:05,337
No thanks

106
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,870
It's too hard

107
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,607
I really hate doing laundry

108
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,182
But you're so nice

109
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,788
to do all the laundry

110
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,681
Since I'm always home,
I'd feel guilty if I didn't

111
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,151
It's also good exercise

112
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,575
Stop Gonna give me
clothes again, huh?

113
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:41,535
Yeah

114
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:46,444
Hey, am I some beggar?
I have plenty more than you

115
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,378
I know
But they're useless to me

116
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,658
Why?

117
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,788
Why are they useless?

118
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,125
They're too big for me

119
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,300
Why do I keep losing
weight doing nothing?

120
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,341
Sorry

121
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,606
Know that you're
more sensitive sometimes?

122
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,046
It's not that
I don't like your clothes

123
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,319
Look, our styles
are totally different

124
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,222
When I wear your clothes,
it feels awkward,

125
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,034
as if I'm wearing a g-string

126
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,632
Have you ever
tried on a g-string?

127
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,241
Yeah, just once

128
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,816
It was really weird

129
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,408
It was so gross
I couldn't walk

130
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,546
It was, huh?
And really tight

131
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,982
How can a movie not have
a single kiss scene?

132
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,552
No fun

133
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,833
You said you
kissed before, huh?

134
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,193
Of course

135
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:11,994
With whom?

136
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,132
Would you know if I told you?

137
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,064
Just a guy

138
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,744
What does it feel like?

139
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,009
A kiss?

140
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,315
First of all,
Your mouth gets really dry

141
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,147
And then right here

142
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,048
Hey!

143
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:37,893
Here
Your nipples get hard,

144
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,966
then you get
really lightheaded,

145
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,962
and your arms and legs go numb

146
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,405
It can't be explained

147
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:57,305
Anyway, it feels really awesome
I like kissing better than sex

148
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,515
Sex?

149
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,544
Stop lying

150
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,882
Think whatever you want

151
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,962
But you have a big problem

152
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,691
Guys don't like it
if you can't kiss right

153
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,329
- Want me to teach you?
- Hey!

154
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,063
You have to learn

155
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,568
Don't!

156
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,683
Doesn't my face look weird?

157
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,655
My nose is crooked
and there's a mole by my mouth

158
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,223
I hate it

159
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,998
You're so pretty

160
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,432
That's why guys can't resist

161
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,735
No, you're pretty

162
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,603
Really?

163
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,046
Look, we can see both of us

164
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,180
I wish we could always
be seen together

165
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,920
'96 Soo-in & Kyung-hee

166
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,396
Shoot! Goal!
Man, that sucked

167
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,798
What's the score?

168
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,696
One to one

169
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,646
Can we join you?

170
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,063
For a big match against Japan,

171
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,435
someone's got
the wrong attitude

172
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:14,385
Hey
Hey

173
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:21,048
Goal! Lee min-sung!

174
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:35,071
My senior classmate owns this place.
I just work here part time

175
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,337
We didn't go to college,
and are just hanging around

176
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,974
You see, we weren't
good at school

177
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,413
We even barely
finished high school

178
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,752
I'm an English Lit major,
and I'm taking a break

179
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,684
My dream is to travel freely

180
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,722
My dream is to never change
even as I get older

181
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,525
My dad treats me
like a baby still

182
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,527
Yeah, but he's
much better than mine

183
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,107
My dad always drinks

184
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,311
My dad was died when I was twelve

185
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,175
Don't take it so seriously

186
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,517
I'm fine with it

187
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,654
Because my father
is always here

188
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,958
Don't you miss him, though?

189
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,393
I have his pictures

190
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,795
My father loved to take photos

191
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,864
We probably have as many as
ten family albums

192
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:47,436
When we look at them
when relatives come over, they think we're strange

193
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,310
Since we have fun and laugh
at the pictures

194
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,680
But we're laughing
because we're happy

195
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,618
There's a photo of us
at the amusement park,

196
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,484
and one in front of our house
when we first moved in

197
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,429
There's even a photo
of all the family naked

198
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,763
Hey, that sounds like a lie

199
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,062
It's true

200
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,137
We took baths together
until I was nine

201
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,470
Oh, yeah

202
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,578
How did you come up with that clock idea?

203
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,326
There he is!

204
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,912
Ji-hwan got a haircut

205
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,131
Do you mind moving your foot?

206
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,572
What did you say?

207
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,910
You prick

208
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,212
Move your foot

209
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,740
My friend finds it
uncomfortable

210
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,316
Hey, let's move back

211
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,006
Thanks Ji-hwan

212
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,004
Hey, you're pretty brave

213
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,984
I'm shaking all over

214
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:14,717
I've fallen in love.
What should I do?

215
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,214
It's no big deal

216
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:25,887
No, it hurts so much.
But I want to keep on hurting

217
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,108
It's Ji-hwan!

218
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,716
Oh no, it's a cop!

219
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,387
Hold hands

220
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,688
One, two, three

221
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,366
Match the steps

222
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,509
Left, left, left...

223
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,218
Dad, did you see
the movie Il Postino?

224
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,691
Il Posit?
Is that really a movie?

225
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,418
You have to see it with mom.
It's very moving

226
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,667
I've fallen in love

227
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,866
What should I do?

228
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,602
It hurts so much

229
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,839
But I want to
keep on hurting

230
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,713
Mom, have you
ridden the Viking?

231
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,791
Do you mind
moving your foot?

232
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,189
My friend finds it
uncomfortable

233
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,999
I've fallen in love

234
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,372
It hurts so much

235
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,844
But I want to
keep on hurting

236
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,025
Man, it hurts

237
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,429
But I want to
keep on hurting!

238
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,189
Oh my, Ji-hwan!
It's been so long

239
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,217
How are you?

240
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,320
Ji-hwan,
you little bastard!

241
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,429
How've you been?

242
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,326
Good, of course.
I almost forget your face

243
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,370
Am I coming at a busy time?

244
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:24,237
You're the one
who's been busy, punk

245
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,178
What's this?

246
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,308
Your pictures

247
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,418
I put some I liked
in my room

248
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,445
It's okay, right?

249
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,018
Of course

250
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,720
Still taking pictures lately?

251
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,655
No

252
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,489
My camera is probably
rusted by now

253
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,928
Well, taking pictures
can't pay for your tuition

254
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,232
You know what?

255
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,434
I liked your pictures,

256
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,713
but I liked watching you
take them better

257
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,414
You look a lot better now

258
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,425
That rotten little...

259
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,627
When are you
getting married?

260
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,922
I want to
as soon as possible

261
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,398
But she said she doesn't
trust me still

262
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,444
'96 Soo-in & Kyung-Hee

263
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,876
Don't you miss them?

264
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,321
I sometimes think about them

265
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,952
Chul-hyun

266
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,355
What if...

267
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,164
If

268
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,593
What if they
had called to meet?

269
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:01,967
Did they call you?

270
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,801
They did, huh?

271
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,500
Not really

272
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,103
I'm not sure

273
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,747
What's that supposed to mean?

274
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,714
Should I meet them?

275
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,049
What's the problem?

276
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,726
Do you still
have feelings for them?

277
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,293
At first, as time passed

278
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,559
I thought of them

279
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:40,075
hundred times a day, then ninety-nine,

280
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,811
ninety-eight,

281
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,607
ninety-seven,

282
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,377
and then when
I forgot to count,

283
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:54,724
I was confused on whether
they had black or brown hair,

284
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,321
or if I had
really liked them,

285
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,298
or wonder if
we really did meet

286
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,270
I thought about those things

287
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,311
'96 Soo-in & Kyung-Hee

288
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,773
I'm gonna marry him

289
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,718
He likes you, too?

290
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,088
No

291
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,658
Yes, probably

292
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,357
He always recommends
love stories and poems

293
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,563
And he smiles at me always

294
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,073
Ji-hwan,
can you do me a favor?

295
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,122
He always eats a little

296
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,821
That's why he
doesn't gain weight

297
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,723
It's so irritating

298
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,465
Want me to just
talk to him, right?

299
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,528
Yeah

300
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,604
Hi

301
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,110
Hello

302
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,614
Need a book?

303
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,186
That's okay

304
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,222
I'll pick one out
myself today

305
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,288
He's my friend from church

306
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,158
Hello

307
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,222
Oh, hello

308
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,896
- You pick one out, too
- Okay

309
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,136
Excuse me

310
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,111
What's the most
popular book these days?

311
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,078
What kind of books
do you like?

312
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,483
Well, anything
that's easy to read

313
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,890
Have you ever read
Hu Sam-gwan's Blood?

314
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,626
I already read that...

315
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:12,221
So...

316
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,863
I heard that this book
is really good

317
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,466
- This one?
- Yes

318
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,773
- It's great
- What is it about?

319
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:32,305
It's like a detective story.
The author is German

320
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,718
His shoulders are wider
than I thought

321
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,248
I better change the size

322
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,084
Isn't he good-looking?

323
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,357
It seemed as if he
was jealous of you, too

324
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,554
But Ji-yoon,
we look so much alike,

325
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,365
so wouldn't he realize
that we were related?

326
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,533
Look at our nose and mouth

327
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,338
And when a guy knows
some girl likes him,

328
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,473
he'll stay distant,
even if he likes her

329
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,209
No, we don't look
alike at all

330
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,614
Your eyes are more slanted

331
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,383
And you have a
bigger head than me

332
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,389
It's hand-made

333
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm not sure

334
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,638
Min-sik!
Come here for a sec

335
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,143
Have you ever
seen this letter?

336
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,305
Oh, this

337
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:13,884
Do you know it?

338
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,343
Absolutely no idea

339
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,281
There's no address and no name

340
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,222
Who'd sent it like this?

341
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,570
My name is Hang Min-shik

342
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,775
I deliver mail
in a small town

343
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,217
I've been delivering
these strange mails lately

344
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,057
This is her room

345
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,721
I'm in love with this girl

346
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,912
I don't understand

347
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,338
why she doesn't send these letters

348
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:28,357
But anyhow, I'm just a postman

349
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,793
She's taking
pictures again today

350
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:44,572
Holding back my wish
to scribble with you together

351
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,906
I told you I'm busy

352
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,636
Just one more question

353
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,740
Are your dreams
often colorful?

354
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:53,775
- No
- No

355
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,180
It's often for me.
Yes

356
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,714
Here are the results

357
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,752
Kyung-hee and I
are the same type

358
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,025
Someone who has one heart
to love only one person

359
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,395
Never cheats,

360
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,430
but due to obsessiveness,
you're likely to be a stalker

361
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:17,432
Fantastic.
One heart to love only one person

362
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,372
What about me?
What does it say?

363
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:25,438
Ji-hwan,
you're the most indecisive

364
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,341
Not any good as a lover

365
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,686
You imagine and decide on your own,
so you're left just liking the girl

366
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,818
If you do date,
you'll break a lot of promises

367
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,052
The worst of their kind

368
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,055
Do you believe that stuff?

369
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,093
That's girls for you

370
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,665
No need to get upset

371
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,642
Soo-in
Go help Ji-hwan

372
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,104
It'll be good exercise

373
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,615
Think so?

374
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,224
Ji-hwan,
what's your blood type?

375
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:14,054
Not again.
A type

376
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,844
Hey.
What are you doing here alone?

377
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,742
Oh, nothing.
Just hanging out

378
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,657
They're so lucky

379
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,302
Don't they look good together?

380
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,208
It's not easy to fall in love at first sight

381
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,346
It's so wonderful

382
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,186
Gonna stay over, right?

383
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,220
No, I got things to do

384
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:13,981
Like what?

385
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,252
I told you I gotta go

386
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:18,391
Kyung-hee

387
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,365
Why do you always ask favors,
and I have to carry them out?

388
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:29,564
Because you never asked me

389
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:31,599
Whatever

390
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,675
I'm tired of that face

391
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,409
Always pretending to be weak,

392
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,816
and as if the world will end
if you're not treated well

393
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,451
How long do you think
I'll be by your side?

394
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,591
Tell me.
Tell me!

395
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,000
Kyung-hee, I'm just...

396
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,103
Let's stop

397
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,429
I'm going, bye

398
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,816
Kyung-hee

399
00:39:55,793 --> 00:40:02,130
Just like you,
I don't know what to do

400
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,053
They came at
five in the morning

401
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,056
They ran away

402
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,196
because their parents disapproved

403
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,709
I'm going no matter
what you say

404
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,338
Your turn

405
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,016
I'm going no matter what,
so don't worry. Sorry dad

406
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:03,586
Good enough?

407
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,995
Here.
Be careful with it

408
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,678
Kyung-hee, it's our school

409
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,580
The gate has changed

410
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,945
Wow, it's been so long

411
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,620
I wish we could go inside

412
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,120
Me, Too

413
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,857
Just ask me,
and I'll do anything

414
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,686
This is so great

415
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,371
Stop!

416
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,367
3767! Stop!

417
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,763
Ji-hwan,
what are you doing?

418
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,671
Just a minute

419
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,217
Come on

420
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,012
Ji-hwan,
someone's down there

421
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,280
What?

422
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,753
Don't wait and
just let it all out

423
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,555
It's fertilizer anyway

424
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,596
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

425
00:42:54,038 --> 00:43:00,068
Oh... my god!

426
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,671
Sure we can see fireflies here?

427
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,880
Yeah. But I think we came too late

428
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,852
Thought they'd still be here

429
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,627
Hey,

430
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,160
let's call the fireflies

431
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,758
How?

432
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,595
I saw it in some book

433
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,300
If you close your eyes
and call them inside,

434
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,934
they'll know to come to you

435
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,003
I don't believe you

436
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,278
Hurry up.
I'm closing my eyes

437
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,413
It's cold!

438
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,565
Hey, how come you guys
are leaving me out?

439
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,671
Isn't she cute?

440
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,939
Yeah.
Sometimes

441
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,409
I want to press her down,

442
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:25,580
catch her,
and then put her in my pocket

443
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,786
Then take her out
whenever I feel bad

444
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:30,953
Me, too

445
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,023
Ji-hwan

446
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,861
Thanks for coming with us

447
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,569
If it wasn't for you,
we'd never go on this trip

448
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,804
You see,

449
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,775
we never went on a normal trip before

450
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,184
I'm more grateful

451
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:07,896
Wait,

452
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,525
where's Kyung-hee?

453
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,165
Kyung-hee?

454
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,066
Huh?

455
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,935
Kyung-hee!

456
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,780
Aren't those her shoes?

457
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:42,157
Kyung-hee!
Kyung-hee!

458
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:51,569
Kyung-hee!

459
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:56,136
I love you my friends!

460
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,642
Hey!

461
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,888
What are you doing here?

462
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,057
You're awake

463
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,957
Is Kyung-hee still sleeping?

464
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,465
Yeah

465
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:36,907
Didn't you two
sleep in your room?

466
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,709
Because of the mosquitoes,

467
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,677
we couldn't sleep

468
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,612
You must've been really tired

469
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,103
We tried to wake you up
several times

470
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,540
I see

471
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:01,086
Wanna talk about
our first love for fun?

472
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,129
First love?

473
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,261
It's better than
just sitting here

474
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:10,266
I like listening to
other people's love stories

475
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:12,867
Yeah?

476
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,535
Then you go first

477
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,045
um...

478
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:23,843
In junior high, this girl
worked at a comic book shop,

479
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,758
Because of her big eyes,

480
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,886
everybody seemed
to be attracted to her

481
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,857
She was really popular
among the guys

482
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,667
I went there everyday
to go see her

483
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,931
All the boys liked her
and came to the store

484
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,567
But one day

485
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,769
something happened

486
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,142
Hey, big eyes.
What's your name?

487
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,309
Hey, let me see your face

488
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,055
You pricks,
mind your own business!

489
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,058
Big eyes,
you're my girl

490
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,088
Everybody got that?

491
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,339
I read five of them

492
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,647
You're lying

493
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,186
You only read one

494
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,051
Huh?

495
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,512
What's your name?

496
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,351
Ji-hwan

497
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,549
Lee Ji-hwan

498
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,019
Can you fight well?

499
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,955
Yes, I can

500
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,724
he calls me

501
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,327
but I don't afraid at all

502
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,607
Because she was behind me

503
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,509
I raised my fists,

504
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,034
and went after him
screaming

505
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,280
It was good up till then

506
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,548
And then?

507
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,015
I got beaten

508
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,819
I couldn't hit him even once,

509
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,514
and he almost killed me

510
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,123
So,

511
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,023
she turned her
back on me and left

512
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,392
I guessed she liked macho men

513
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,824
I heard she married him,

514
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,398
and they run a tent bar now

515
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,330
The end

516
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:17,863
Now, it's your turn

517
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,830
When I was a kid,

518
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,405
I was in the hospital once

519
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,934
That's where

520
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,813
I met him

521
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:52,199
He was a notorious troublemaker
at that hospital

522
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,469
He played a prank
on the nurses,

523
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,105
and then hid in my room

524
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,478
the first time I saw him,

525
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,480
he smiled really stupid

526
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,282
We became friends quickly,

527
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:18,188
and my room turned
completely into a playground

528
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,423
He was special

529
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,330
He was very sick,

530
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,869
but a smile never left his face

531
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,971
When I think of it now,
it's really funny,

532
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,984
but I asked people

533
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,214
to call me by his name

534
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,148
Why?

535
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,594
Well, I thought that

536
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,994
even if
we were to split apart,

537
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,264
I'd feel as if
I was always with him

538
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,795
Ji-hwan

539
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,871
What, Soo-in?

540
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:28,164
We've finally made it

541
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,133
the snow on top of the trees

542
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,068
is so beautiful

543
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,568
people call it snow flowers

544
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:42,138
Wow, you could be a tour guide

545
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,212
We'll just have
to come this winter

546
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,383
Yeah
Let's come again during winter

547
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,318
I'm serious.
Promise

548
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,922
Promise

549
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,913
Seal

550
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,035
Doesn't seem like
it'll stop raining soon

551
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,773
We'd better hurry

552
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:13,937
- Yeah, let's hurry
- A little more

553
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,212
Let's stay a little longer

554
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:34,690
Hold on a little more.
We'll get there soon

555
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,937
Sorry for begging you to come

556
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:52,615
You know me.
Right?

557
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,307
I'm okay

558
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,218
Is she better?

559
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,318
Yeah, she just fell asleep

560
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,811
I'm okay

561
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,850
I'm okay

562


562
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,429
Never saw someone cry before?

563
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:48,797
No, it's just...

564
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,665
Just that it's awkward

565
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:57,113
Hey! I just got sentimental

566
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,848
since it's raining

567
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,885
Why? It's not cool?

568
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:05,878
Ouch, it hurts.
Stop it

569
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:19,761
Ji-yoon!

570
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,888
what are you doing there?

571
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,697
Ji-hwan

572
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,503
I want to be alone

573
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:41,751
Did that bookstore
guy hurt you?

574
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:46,654
No.
I don't like him anymore

575
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,791
He absolutely has no sense

576
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:53,363
And he's not that
good-looking up close

577
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:57,459
And he seems
to flirt with anyone

578
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:05,664
Plus,
he's going to the army

579
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,913
He seems so weak,

580
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,074
so how could they take him in?

581
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:29,496
Long time no see.
You must've been busy

582
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,824
Yes

583
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,737
A great book
came in yesterday

584
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,973
Do you wanna see it?

585
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,304
No, that's okay

586
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,729
I'm not gonna be here
for a while

587
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,368
So I made a list of good books

588
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,943
They're for you to read

589
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,439
Thank you

590
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,680
Take care

591
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:55,583
How do I look?

592
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,548
Where's Soo-in?

593
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,151
She wants to rest at home

594
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,827
yet

595
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,786
Does she still feel sick?

596
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,603
It feels strange

597
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,500
with just the two of us

598
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:26,479
It feels like we're dating

599
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:32,248
Let's skip the exhibition,
and go for a drink

600
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,817
I feel like drinking

601
01:01:57,115 --> 01:02:02,676
Are you coming to Chul-hyun's
birthday party next Saturday?

602
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,117
Friend

603
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:11,184
Wanna learn how to
make a donut with smoke?

604
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,796
If you do this,

605
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,060
girls will love you

606
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,401
Wait

607
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,561
Lighter

608
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:24,099
What's wrong with you?

609
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,440
What's wrong with me?

610
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,516
Don't act

611
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:37,179
as if you're my boyfriend

612
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:47,027
Ji-hwan. Lee Ji-hwan!
Don't flatter yourself, okay?

613
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,736
I'm drinking somewhere else

614
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,208
Don't follow me

615
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,987
What are you doing?

616
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:26,294
I know you're a nice guy

617
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,738
So you don't have to do this

618
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,334
Stop it

619
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:38,741
You!
You look really mean today

620
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,575
Why? Just because

621
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,618
Because I'm drunk

622
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,682
You look very mean

623
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,653
because I'm drunk

624
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,895
Fine, it's all my fault

625
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,331
Let's cross first

626
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,959
Let go, you bastard!

627
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,801
Taxi!

628
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:22,189
Know why I invited
all of you here today?

629
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,061
No particular reason

630
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:32,194
Since life is
so dull and boring,

631
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,670
those who wanna sing, sing,

632
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:38,507
and those who
wanna drink, drink

633
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:39,976
Have fun till you die

634
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:43,312
Hey, stop babbling

635
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,679
- Everyone drink
- Hold on, I'm talking

636
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:52,154
I wanna get something
clear to you all

637
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:55,055
Especially to the ladies here

638
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,129
This woman here
is not my girlfriend

639
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,965
She's just a friend.
Only a friend

640
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,331
Alcohol friend

641
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,304
Please keep your eyes on me

642
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,465
Me, too Me, too

643
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:18,136
Let's drink!
Asta-la-via!

644
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,924
I didn't think you'd come

645
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,063
Are you sober now?

646
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,568
Are you still sick?

647
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,838
I'm much better now

648
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,847
Don't take it off

649
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,441
I'm okay.
It's too uncomfortable

650
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,980
Man, that cold
is lasting forever

651
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,635
Is it alright if I sing?

652
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,434
Oh, sure

653
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:34,279
* The child I'm looking for

654
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:40,252
* Is hard to see

655
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:47,503
* Who understands the world

656
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:53,271
* Who even loves tiny leaves

657
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:59,615
* Whoa, whoa, isn't common

658
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:05,449
* Yeah, yeah, is hard to see

659
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,886
* The child I'm looking for

660
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:16,327
* I can see

661
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:23,739
* My loving friend Ji-hwan

662
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:29,779
* My loving friend Kyung-hee

663
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:35,513
* Whoa, whoa, they can see

664
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:41,486
* Yeah, yeah, I can see

665
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:47,559
* Whoa, whoa, I can see

666
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:55,262
* Yeah, yeah, I can see

667
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:11,554
Ji-hwan, I have
something to tell you

668
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,181
Wanna go outside?

669
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,783
Sorry that I'm going early

670
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,689
No, that's okay.
You're sick,

671
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:24,227
so you should rest

672
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,825
Ji-hwan, wait

673
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,236
Stay still

674
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,134
Huh?

675
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,141
Close your eyes

676
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,243
Why?

677
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:42,677
Just close them for me

678
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:33,296
Okay, you can open them now

679
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:37,404
What was that?

680
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:45,581
I suddenly remembered a game

681
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,482
I played when I was young

682
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,838
Soo-in,

683
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,970
when you catch a cold,

684
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,613
it's good to
brush your teeth

685
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,849
and wash your
feet and hands often

686
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,953
And Soo-in,

687
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,953
I have a favor to ask

688
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:38,489
I think I like Kyung-hee

689
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,225
I'm just asking for your help

690
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:46,007
Kyung-hee, you're
looking at this, huh?

691
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,569
You like me too, right?

692
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,413
What are you doing?

693
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,079
Oh, nothing

694
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,289
I'm leaving

695
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,157
Kyung-hee

696
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:21,566
Will you give this to Soo-in?

697
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:32,218
It's nothing important.
It's just...

698
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:37,058
Don't read it, okay?

699
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,852
All right

700
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,997
There's a taxi

701
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,691
Taxi!

702
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,632
Bye

703
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,744
Get in

704
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,541
You go ahead first

705
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,345
No, just go in

706
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,851
Aren't you getting in?

707
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,876
Don't make me angry

708
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:10,217
Okay, get home safely

709
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,195
You better not look at it

710
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,691
Kyung-hee

711
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,524
It's strange

712
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,828
I could tell you in person,

713
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:27,257
but I felt like
writing to you today

714
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,939
Just read it to me

715
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,903
Really?

716
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,853
To my beloved friend Kyung-hee

717
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:48,983
Beloved?

718
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,525
I'm not reading it

719
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:56,822
Okay, I won't do it again

720
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,967
I had a really hard day

721
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:05,402
I had a hemodialysis twice,

722
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:09,902
and two
intramuscular injections

723
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:15,909
But I beared it.
I didn't make a sound

724
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,514
Good

725
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,815
Know what I thought about
to bear it?

726
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,960
You and Ji-hwan

727
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,830
I thought you'd come tell me

728
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,336
how fun it was with Ji-hwan

729
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,964
Okay, that's enough

730
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,634
I'll read it on my own

731
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:54,553
And this is for Ji-hwan

732
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:59,625
I thought you'd read it
so I was careful

733
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:09,168
Promise me
you'll give it to him

734
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:39,835
Hey,

735
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,066
those girls will never show up

736
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,936
What were you three
doing all that time?

737
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:52,444
Don't know where they live
and their numbers?

738
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:06,161
You're right.
What were we doing?

739
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,900
What have we been doing?

740
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,004
Hello?

741
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,508
Ji-hwan

742
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,720
What's wrong with your hand?

743
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,388
Just an accident

744
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:48,102
You should be careful

745
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:50,603
Yeah

746
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:03,540
I'm really sorry to say this

747
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:09,120
But we became
uncomfortable around you

748
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,755
You guys now make me

749
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,263
uncomfortable, too

750
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,999
If you're done, then go

751
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,536
It's late

752
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:20,149
By any chance,
are you Mrs Kim Yeun-soo?

753
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,380
Yes

754
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:25,523
I'm Lee Ji-hwan,
I called you yesterday

755
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:29,197
Was it the class of 1996?

756
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:30,186
Yes

757
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:34,466
You understand we don't
sell this outside

758
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:38,966
But you're lucky.
We're almost out of them

759
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,004
Thank you

760
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:47,339
By the way,
who are you looking for?

761
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:48,708
Yes?

762
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,677
Well, no

763
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:56,558
Just that my girlfriend
had lost her yearbook

764
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:58,293
No, please

765
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,888
I just thought
I could be of some help

766
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:05,667
You see,
I graduated in 96 as well

767
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,567
I attended this school

768
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,203
Oh, I see

769
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:13,068
It's been five years,
so she might've moved

770
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,506
And I'm also curious as to
who you're looking for

771
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:19,674
You see

772
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,016
It's two people

773
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:27,889
One is Kyung-hee.
Kim Kyung-hee

774
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,325
The other is Soo-in?
Shim Soo-in?

775
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,752
Do you know them?

776
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,827
So that's who
you were looking for

777
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,666
Sure, I know them
since they were famous

778
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,634
They were very sick

779
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:51,074
They barely came to school,
and were always together

780
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:55,148
Others were both jealous
and sympathetic of them

781
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,812
They were very sick?

782
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:05,825
My goodness.
You didn't know?

783
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:12,327
Actually, I was also shocked
when I first heard it

784
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:17,865
They were absent a lot,
but they never showed it

785
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,610
I'm sorry to tell you this

786
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:31,084
Soo-in isn't in Seoul anymore,
and Kyung-hee passed away

787
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,116
Pardon?

788
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:39,425
What are you talking about?
Kyung-hee's dead?

789
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,763
Yes, it's so awful

790
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:48,332
I was a sophomore then

791
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,199
It's been five years already

792
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:57,943
Kyung-hee's dead?
Kyung-hee?

793
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:05,176
Soo-in will be hard to find

794
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,589
After Kyung-hee died,

795
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:10,786
Soo-in's health got worse

796
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,656
She had it hard

797
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:16,026
Since they relied on
each other so much

798
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:24,963
Holding back my wish
to scribble with you together

799
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,335
But Min-sik
will be in late today

800
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:31,612
Can you tell me
where I find him?

801
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,240
Ji-hwan!

802
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:52,590
Ji-hwan! Ji-hwan!

803
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:59,500
Ji-hwan, where did you go?
You scared us

804
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,101
Hi!

805
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:34,398
* The child I'm looking for

806
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:42,037
* is hard to see

807
01:24:54,022 --> 01:25:00,518
Do you have a girlfriend now?

808
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:17,212
Kyung-hee, I found Ji-hwan

809
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,180
I found Ji-hwan

810
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:24,584
Really? That's great

811
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,644
Hold on

812
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:06,088
Soo-in, let's change
our names from today

813
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,730
I'm Soo-in and you're Kyung-hee

814
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:12,300
Why?
Why do you wanna change names?

815
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:18,637
If we do, even if we're apart

816
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:24,573
we'll think of each other always

817
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:29,277
That'll be fun.
You're Soo-in and I'm Kyung-hee

818
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:33,151
When I think of it now,
it's really funny,

819
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:38,449
but I asked people
to call me by his name

820
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:39,887
Why?

821
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:47,732
Well, I thought that even if
we were to split apart,

822
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:51,303
I'd feel as if
I was always with him

823
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:07,153
Next.
Number 42, Shim Soo-in

824
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,379
- Yes
- Yes

825
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:17,665
Kyung-hee,

826
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,394
Yes

827
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:30,769
Soo-in -- Kyung-Hee

828
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:35,744
You're so lucky
to ride on this

829
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,353
You know what?

830
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:43,658
Nurse Park and Dr Kim
had a fling

831
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:47,856
They were caught kissing
in the medicine room

832
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:51,024
- Kyung-hee
- Yeah?

833
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,366
I love you

834
01:27:56,104 --> 01:28:01,371
Me, too

835
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,219
Ji-hwan, she's here

836
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:24,064
Hi

837
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:43,223
Hi

838
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,168
Oh yeah, I forgot

839
01:33:05,546 --> 01:33:08,879
You had a small scar here

840
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:18,787
So this mole
was on the left side

841
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,387
I wasn't sure

842
01:33:54,261 --> 01:34:02,293
Kyung-hee's got a boyfriend

843
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:07,999
Kyung-hee's got a boyfriend

844
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:10,009
I'm taking her away!

845
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:12,841
No!

846
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:15,177
Don't take her!

847
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:29,488
It's Ji-yoon, the one who
always borrowed romance novels

848
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:32,130
Do you remember me?

849
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:43,740
Hi.
I miss you

850
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:27,722
Congratulations, be happy

851
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:28,589
Thanks, go and eat

852
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:33,518
See you at the reception.
Eat only two servings

853
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:38,254
Your wish came true.
Congratulations

854
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:41,192
Congratulations.
Thanks Ji-hwan

855
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:42,803
Congratulations

856
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:45,239
Thank you.
Congratulations also

857
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:47,207
on getting back together

858
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:54,615
How about a picture for this moment?
I'll take it for you

859
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:58,953
Should we?

860
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:00,750
No

861
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:04,483
You look fine

862
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:57,407
You have to give it to him

863
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:10,357
Hi, Ji-hwan. It's Soo-in.
Are you doing okay?

864
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:18,824
Of course.
Soo-in, are you doing okay, too?

865
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:23,862
I think I'm going far away

866
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:29,068
I really don't want to go

867
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:34,339
What will I do if I
miss you and Kyung-hee?

868
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:39,617
Ji-hwan,
take care of Kyung-hee

869
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,191
I know without you telling me

870
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:48,184
that you two like each other

871
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:53,291
Here's some advice
about Kyung-hee

872
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:56,400
Kyung-hee's favorite food are

873
01:37:56,704 --> 01:38:01,573
sponge cake with yellow jam
and strawberry juice

874
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:06,575
And she likes guys
who has a funny bright smile

875
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:12,144
Look carefully
between her eyes

876
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:16,957
If she has three wrinkles,
it means she's feeling sick

877
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:21,985
So send her home quickly

878
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:29,399
She likes to hold hands,
so do it often

879
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:33,730
My beloved friend, Ji-hwan

880
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:44,015
Today I feel like eating the
instant noodles you made for me

881
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:50,882
Change into this

882
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:59,133
Dad, you're really handsome,
but there's something missing

883
01:38:59,133 --> 01:39:02,899
What is?

884
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:06,200
- Dad, come here
- Yes

885
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:09,769
- Stay still
- Yeah

886
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:42,567
Hi, Ji-hwan.
It's Kyung-hee

887
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:47,809
I'm alone right now

888
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:51,874
My dad suddenly
had to go to Seoul

889
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:56,949
You better not laugh at this

890
01:39:58,025 --> 01:40:03,429
When I go away,

891
01:40:04,365 --> 01:40:09,462
I told him I wanted a beautiful
funeral like in the movies

892
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:15,201
It'll probably cost a lot
since I wanted a fitted dress

893
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:22,583
I wanted to look pretty
for people one last time

894
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:25,677
Especially you

895
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,580
I'm worried about
your company test

896
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:34,351
Since you came to see me often,
you didn't have much time

897
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:41,268
It was awkard and silent
between us,

898
01:40:41,268 --> 01:40:46,296
but I was happy, thinking about the old days.
How about you?

899
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:51,737
I did, too

900
01:40:52,746 --> 01:40:57,012
I think I'm a very lucky girl

901
01:40:57,418 --> 01:41:02,412
All I have are happy memories

902
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:09,494
Soo-in, who made me
laugh all the time

903
01:41:12,132 --> 01:41:17,263
And for making me realize how
wonderful taking pictures are,

904
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:20,871
my beloved Ji-hwan

905
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:31,084
Ji-hwan, a nice gentleman

906
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:34,616
who accepted my awkward kiss

907
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:41,854
This is embarrassing,
but I really liked it then

908
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:46,790
I want to erase this line

909
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,730
Forget it, I'm too tired

910
01:41:54,808 --> 01:41:57,538
Coming to my funeral, right?

911
01:41:58,212 --> 01:42:03,047
You have to come.
Since I miss you as well

912
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:05,619
If a single guy
doesn't show up,

913
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:10,215
people will feel
really sorry for me

914
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:20,124
Oh yeah, I have something to tell you.
You might get angry at me

915
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:26,772
Remember that letter
for Soo-in?

916
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:31,942
I ripped it up

917
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:37,978
I feel better now
for telling you

918
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:42,714
You'll forgive me, right?

919
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:48,689
I'll tell Soo-in
when I meet her

920
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:55,193
Ji-hwan, I love you

921
01:42:57,237 --> 01:43:04,268
I loved you before
and I love you now

922
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:10,643
Good-bye, Ji-hwan.
Good-bye
