1
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,680
Nine ball is rotation pool.

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
The balls are pocketed
in numbered order.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,680
The only ball that means anything--
that wins it-- is the nine.

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,240
Now, the player can shoot
eight trick shots in a row...

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,840
blow the nine, and lose.

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,520
On the other hand, the player can
get the nine in on the break...

7
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,040
if the balls spread right,
and win.

8
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,200
Which is to say that
luck plays a part in nine ball.

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,080
But for some players...

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,160
luck itself is an art.

11
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Color.

12
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Check the color.

13
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,040
Dead giveaway,
you know?

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,400
It`s thick.
You can almost feel it.

15
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,240
Lay down and just let it
roll all over you.

16
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,360
That`s single malt.

17
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,880
Then on the other hand
you got something like Old McDonnell.

18
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,560
More like Young McDonnell actually.

19
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,720
Tastes like six-year-old bonded.

20
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
Smell this.

21
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,120
- That`s good stuff.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,920
Very good stuff.

23
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,560
I can get you a case of this
for 3 5.50 less than your wholesaler...

24
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,480
can get you a case ofJack Daniel`s.

25
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,160
45.50 less than he can get you
a case of Wild Turkey.

26
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,400
Why don`t you go peddle that
to one of your hotel chains.

27
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,320
''Peddle``?

28
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,160
I don`t do that. Do I do that?

29
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,640
- This is family.
- I`m glad to see you too.

30
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Come to my house tonight.
I`ll make you an omelette.

31
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,280
- I make the omelettes.
- Okay. You make the omelettes.

32
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,400
Did you forget the omelette
I made you last time?

33
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,640
- No. I didn`t forget.
- Yeah? What was it? What was in it?

34
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,800
- Eddie.
- Sweet sausage.

35
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,520
''Sweet sausage.``
Hey, I never made you sweet sausage.

36
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,520
- Who the hell made you sweet sausage?
- Eddie.

37
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,480
- Come on. What was in it?
- Uh, um--

38
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,840
- Sour.
- Sour-- Sour cream and caviar, right?

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,240
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Eddie.

40
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,400
Aw,Julian, what am I doing here?
Am I workin`?

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,400
I`m workin` too.
I`ve got this guy. He`s up to 20 a rack.

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
What guy?

43
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,600
We`re playing two, two and a half hours
for five a game.

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,480
- He`s up to 30.
- So?

45
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,680
So I`ve been playing him off.
That`s what`s ''so.``

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,240
Yo, Vincent!

47
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,200
Vincent, we`re on.

48
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,040
Hey, Vincent.

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,040
Can you believe this guy?

50
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,760
Hey, Vinnie.

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,720
I mean,
you slide some of this stuff into...

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
a bottle of Old Granddad,
Wild Turkey, you`d hardly be lying.

53
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
Don`t even need iodine.
It`s a beautiful bourbon.

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,880
- Pick me up at 10:00.
- What?

55
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,120
- I get off at 10:00.
- Not without me, you don`t.

56
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,560
- Do ya?
- Lately.

57
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,800
Now wait a minute. Come on.
I`m talkin` bourbon, okay?

58
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
You know the secret? These people--
they get a hold of aged kegs.

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,160
What are you tasting? You`re
tasting a low fusel oil content...

60
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,120
low acidic content,
just like the big guys, honey.

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
- It`s the kegs.
- Where do you get the kegs?

62
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,440
You don`t just
get kegs like that anywhere.

63
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,600
Hey. That was fast.
What the hell happened?

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,440
- I slipped.
- And if I stumble

65
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,840
- He slipped.
- If I fall
- Yeah.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,000
- Where do they get the kegs?
- Mmm.

67
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,400
They just do. That`s all.
Okay, listen. Do whatever you want to do.

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
It`s gonna leave the warehouse
one way or the other.

69
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,800
- Come on. On the snap, Vincent.
- One more night

70
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,280
- That kid`s got a sledgehammer break.
- One more night

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,880
One more night

72
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,200
- 'Cause I can't wait forever
- Bottoms up.

73
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,200
- Do you know who loves this stuff?
- Who?

74
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
- The Chinese.
- It must be the low fusel oil content.

75
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,280
Don`t kid yourself.
It has its effect.

76
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,720
It`s just like one of those things
that you`d never think about...

77
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
but can make your day,
like electricity.

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,000
'Cause I can't wait forever

79
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,040
- Eddie, loan me another 20.
- Who you working, me or him?

80
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,440
He`s on the ropes, Eddie.
He just lucked out.

81
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
You know me, right?

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,840
Take it easy.

83
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,920
- And I was wondering, should I call you
- Victory.

84
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,040
- Maybe you're not alone
- Yep.

85
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Pick us out a nice bottle of wine
for tonight, will ya?

86
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,880
- Red or white?
- Come on. On the snap, Vincent.

87
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,280
One more night
'Cause I can't wait forever

88
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,760
- Hey, Eddie. About those labels.
- Yeah.

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,720
Can you get me some Wild Turkey labels?

90
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,640
- Ooh,just one more night
- Sure.

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,440
Oh, one more night

92
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,400
'Cause I can't wait forever

93
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,360
Give me one more night

94
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,160
Give me one more night

95
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,080
Give me one more night

96
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,280
- I can't wait forever
- Hiya. How you doing?

97
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
Like a river to the sea

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,200
I will always be with you

99
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,240
And if you sail away

100
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,000
I will follow you

101
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,920
Give me one more night

102
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,280
Give mejust one more night

103
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,520
- Kid draws some bead, huh?
- Oh, one more night

104
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,080
'Cause I can't wait forever

105
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,280
I know there'll never be a time

106
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,360
- You'll ever feel the same
- Play him again,Julian.

107
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,160
- You really got him on the ropes.
- I`m all right, chief.

108
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,480
Eddie, I gotta split.

109
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,640
- You`re going?
- I gotta see somebody.

110
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,840
Aw, come on.
One more game here.

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,240
- I`m bust.
- So let`s just ''play`` play.

112
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
- What?
- Let`s just play for play, man. No money.

113
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,640
- Maybe we both can learn
- ''Play`` play?

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,680
- Give mejust one more night
- Show me what you got here.
- Vincent.

115
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,600
Hey,Julian.
I just want your best game.

116
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,600
- One more night
- I think maybe the money`s what`s
throwing you off here today.

117
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,000
One more night

118
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,560
'Cause I can't wait forever

119
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,160
- Give mejust one more night
- Okay, how about I win, no money...

120
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,080
you win, I`ll throw you 20.

121
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,280
One more night

122
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
- One more night
- No?

123
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,320
'Cause I can't wait forever

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,240
What`s the matter with this guy?

125
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,600
All right, Carmen.
Who`s next? Nobody.

126
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey. Excuse me.
You wanna play me?

127
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
For your girlfriend.

128
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,920
- No, one game.
- No.

129
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,120
I`ll spot you the seven and nine.

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,640
The seven, eight and nine.

131
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,280
- I`ll give you the table.
- You wanna play him?

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,320
Me?

133
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,280
- Sure.
- You really don`t wanna play me?

134
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,840
- Twenty a rack.
- No. 500 a rack.

135
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,800
- I can`t get a game.
- Oh, are you serious?

136
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,360
I never kid about money.

137
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,880
Cowards!
Off with their heads.

138
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
You don`t know what you`re doing, do ya?

139
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,320
- What do you mean?
- Well, you just blew 500 bucks.

140
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,480
That kid, he has both arms in traction,
he beats anybody in the room.

141
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,480
Yeah. Yeah, he could.

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,840
So I`ll offer it to you again.
I`ll play him for 500 bucks.

143
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,640
You don`t know what to say, do ya?

144
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,800
Maybe I`m hustling you,
maybe I`m not. You don`t know.

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,680
But you should know. See, if you know
that, you know when to say yes.

146
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,640
You know when to say no.

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
Everybody goes home in a limousine.

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,840
- So what should I say? Yes or no?
- You should say no.

149
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,520
You know why? `Cause it`s
too much money, and I`m an unknown.

150
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
He should be the unknown.

151
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,280
I mean, that would be nice.

152
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,440
That would be beautiful.
You could play around with that.
You could control that.

153
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,320
You know what I mean?

154
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,520
I`ll offer it to you again.
I`ll play him for 500 bucks.

155
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,040
No.

156
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
Actually, you shoulda said yes.

157
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,120
But how you gonna know that?
I mean, it`s very hard to know that.
It`s very complex.

158
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,880
It`s like which twin has got the Toni.

159
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,720
Maybe they both got the Toni.
Maybe Toni`s a guy. Maybe Toni`s bald.

160
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
You know? How you gonna know that?
It`s very complicated. Plus, too much money.

161
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,840
- Jesus, you`re crazy.
- No, I`m not.Just common sense.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,480
How `bout I take you guys
out for dinner tonight?

163
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,160
- You should ask Vincent.
- No. You should ask Vincent.

164
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,080
You beat him. You know the last time
Julian lost for me?

165
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,400
It`s just a game, man.
Some balls and a stick.

166
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
Balls and a stick.
This is Vincent.

167
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Nine ball`s not that tough. Do you
want to know what`s tough? Stocker.

168
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,000
- Stocker.
- It`s his video game.

169
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,080
- Vincent`s the best at it.
- I`m the best at it.

170
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,040
I mean, in pool,
you just got these balls...

171
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,080
you`re just sitting there, you take your
time, you set up a shot, but Stocker--

172
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,480
Can you make any money
playing Stocker?

173
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,400
I`ll tell you what I can do off Stocker.
Ten years from now I can get into West Point.
That`s what I can do with Stocker.

174
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
It`s all coming down to
video game reflexes. I mean, uh...

175
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,080
computerized tanks, uh, Star Wars--
you know, that movie.

176
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,760
I mean, 10 years from now,
a guy who scores heavy on Stocker...

177
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,760
is a shoo-in at the Point.

178
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
- You are beautiful.
- You don`t believe me.

179
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,520
- What do you mean ''money``?
- ''Money`` money.

180
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,000
- Really.
- Hey, look.

181
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,560
If you got a-- an area of excellence--
you`re good at something--

182
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,360
you`re the best at something--
anything-- then rich can be arranged.

183
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,120
- I mean, rich can come fairly easy.
- Really.

184
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Yeah. You got some other area
of excellence beside this Stocker?

185
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Nine ball? Right?

186
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,480
- You`re some piece of work.
- I`m some piece of work.

187
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,880
- You`re also a natural character.
- I been telling her that.

188
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,280
- You know, I got natural character.
- No, that`s not what I said, kid.

189
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,040
I said you are a natural character.
You`re an incredible flake.

190
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
But that`s a gift.

191
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,480
See, guys spend half their lives
trying to invent somethin` like that.

192
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,600
You walk into a poolroom
with that ''go, go, go``...

193
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,360
the guys will be killing each other
trying to get to you.

194
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,480
You got that.
But I`ll tell you somethin`, kiddo...

195
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,280
you couldn`t find big time
if you had a road map.

196
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Pool excellence is not about
excellent pool.

197
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,960
It`s about becoming somethin`.

198
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah?

199
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,960
Yeah.

200
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,880
- Like what?
- A student.

201
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,120
You gotta be a student of human moves.

202
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,520
See, all the greats that I know of,
to a man...

203
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,680
were students of human moves.

204
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,640
''Students of human moves.``

205
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,320
Yeah. That`s my area of excellence.

206
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,720
Oh, yeah?

207
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,640
Yeah.

208
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,680
What?

209
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,600
What?

210
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,880
Okay. That guy at the end
of the bar in a black suit...

211
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,040
he`s been hustlin` that broad
for half an hour.

212
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,960
He`s gonna throw in the towel
in 30 seconds for a buck.

213
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,480
You got it.
Starting now. Eh.

214
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,800
- Ten seconds.
- What do you mean ''rich can be arranged``?

215
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,360
Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four,
twenty-five, twenty-six...

216
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,280
twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

217
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,000
Guess the news, you lose.

218
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Ah, and I just missed it
by a couple of seconds.

219
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,480
You wanna up the bet?

220
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,600
Yeah.

221
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,520
Check for the meal says
I leave with her in two minutes.

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay. Ready, go. Now.

223
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,120
- I`m counting.
- I don`t believe this.

224
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,480
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but would you come outside
and take a look at my car?

225
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,880
- Your car?
- Yeah.

226
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,800
Come on.

227
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,760
Hold it here for a second, will ya?

228
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,360
Human moves, kid.
You study the watch, but I study you.

229
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,040
You get the check.
Excuse me.

230
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,040
Cab`s on me.

231
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
What`s with the car, Eddie?

232
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Nothin`. I`ll drive you home.

233
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,440
I just hated to see you sitting alone at
the bar, Diane. It`s just-- It`s depressing.

234
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,160
- Did you seeJimmy in there?
- Yeah, I saw him.

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,560
Has he still got his nighttime job?

236
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
He wanted to talk to you about
something, but, uh, you were busy.

237
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,680
Where`d you go?

238
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,080
- What?
- You certainly weren`t here.

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
Oh, yeah?
Where was I?

240
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,680
God, the earth moved.

241
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,680
Didn`t it move for you a little bit?

242
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,240
That was a train.

243
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,120
No. It was you.

244
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,960
But it certainly wasn`t San Juan.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,600
I mean, if you`re gonna talk
earth-moving, you gotta talk San Juan.

246
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
Remember that water bed we had?

247
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,600
God. Sometimes
I think about that week.

248
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,320
You know, Eddie, when I`m behind the bar
I think-- I think...

249
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,240
''I`m gonna go and get me a water bed.``

250
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Not tell anybody--
just make it a surprise.

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,280
Get some rum
and pineapple juice.

252
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,480
You couldn`t tell me one word
I just said, could you?

253
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,240
No, I couldn`t.

254
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,240
What about rum and pineapple juice?

255
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
Look, that`s--

256
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,720
I don`t know.
That kid today--

257
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,560
It was like watching home movies.

258
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,320
Just made me wonder.

259
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,400
Wonder what?

260
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,000
Made me wonder about San Juan.

261
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,800
What did you mean last night...

262
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,160
about money and all that stuff?

263
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,120
Come here.
I want to show you something.

264
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,040
- So this is liquor money, huh?
- Some.

265
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,000
I invest.
Do you know what I invest in?

266
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,320
Excellence.

267
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,520
- You think Vincent`s that good?
- Well, he`s got the eye.

268
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,760
He`s got the stroke. He`s got the flake.
He`s got that down cold.

269
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,480
But, uh, can he flake on
and flake off? I don`t know.

270
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,120
See, I don`t know whether
that can be taught. That`s not clear.

271
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,040
He`s gotta learn how to be himself,
but on purpose.

272
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,040
- Yeah.
- Do you like to travel?

273
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,240
- Yeah, yeah.
- You like hotels?

274
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Yeah, sure. They`re okay.

275
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,920
Are you gonna help me with him?

276
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,200
That lady you picked up
last night in the bar...

277
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,520
you knew her from before, right?

278
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Mm-hmm. And the guy.

279
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,040
You probably had his schedule down cold,
right? Maybe he works around here
somewhere. He`s your brother-in-law?

280
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,640
- You`re a hard broad.
- Uh-huh.

281
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,800
What does Vincent see in you?

282
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,400
Vincent`s the best.
That`s what he sees in me.

283
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,680
We`ve just been together
for about a year.

284
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,680
Vincent made us get a place together.

285
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,920
You know how we met?

286
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,840
My old boyfriend last year got busted...

287
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,280
breaking into Vincent`s parents` house.

288
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,360
We met at the police station--
me and Vincent.

289
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,480
- You were bailing him out--
your boyfriend.
- No. No, no, no.

290
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,680
I got busted too.
I was driving the car.

291
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,000
See this? Look.

292
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
- Vincent`s mother`s.
- He gave that to you.

293
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,080
No. From the robbery.

294
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,880
Vince says his mother has one
just like it.

295
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,080
He`s sweet.

296
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,160
Vincent`s real sweet.

297
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,960
The problem with this one
is that it`s made in Taiwan.

298
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,520
Now you want something
for your kid to bounce in.

299
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
What country comes to mind when
you think bouncing? What animal bounces?

300
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,960
- A kangaroo. It comes from where?
- Australia.

301
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,680
That`s right. This is Australian-made.
I`ll be perfectly honest with you.

302
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,600
It`s twice as expensive, but it`s--

303
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,480
but it`s three times
better than Taiwan over here.

304
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,200
And I`ll throw you 15 off on this.

305
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,120
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?
- We`ll do it.

306
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,360
All right, Mr. and Mrs. Randall.
Hey, it`s a good buy.

307
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,080
Hey, Lou. Could you write them up?
Australia. Fifteen off. All right?

308
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,280
- Thank you.
- If you ever need anything-- Vincent, okay?

309
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,640
- Okay.
- Thanks.

310
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,160
Mr. Felson,
what can I do you for here?

311
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,560
Uh, Eddie is okay.
In fact,just plain Ed, if you want.

312
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,480
Ye-- Yes, sir.

313
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,360
Me and you, is there some place
private we can talk?

314
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,840
Do you hear the frog?

315
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,160
There`s gonna be a nine-ball
tournament, end of April.

316
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,280
Atlantic City. There`ll be a lot of
action there. I think we oughta go.

317
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,320
- ''We.``
- Yeah. Me, you and Carmen.

318
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,240
Yeah? That sounds like
a lot of fun.

319
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
The best part is
we ought to leave tomorrow.

320
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,040
Tomorrow? Why not leave today?
''Tomorrow.``

321
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,240
What is it with this guy?
You crack me up.

322
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,600
Vincent, if you`re gonna take
the plunge, give yourself a fair shake.

323
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,840
Now, you go at this thing half-assed,
nobody`s gonna do any good.
Go on the road. Six weeks.

324
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,440
Get some seasoning.
Put together some stuff.

325
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,480
- Why don`t you askJulian?
I mean, he`d be into that, right?
- Julian`s a face. He`s known.

326
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,480
You`re a nobody.
I get better bets with you.

327
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Now, if you know some other way that I can
be honest with you, you gotta tell me.

328
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
This is my job, Eddie.

329
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,120
You think so?

330
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,840
Hmm. That`s funny. I don`t think so.
I think it`s your problem.

331
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,520
- What is?
- Well...

332
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,960
you`re hooked on Carmen,
aren`t ya?

333
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,800
- Yeah.
- Crazy about her?

334
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,160
You`re getting a little personal here.

335
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,600
- What?
- You`re losing her, kiddo.

336
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,560
- What do you mean?
- She don`t get the allure of this place.

337
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,040
- Hey, Vincent.
- Wait.

338
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
- What?
- Take a good look at her, Vincent.

339
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
She`s starting to pack.

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,040
- You don`t know her.
- I didn`t know that broad...

341
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,320
at that bar last night either.

342
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,880
She`s bored, Vincent. Are you
listening to what I`m telling ya?

343
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,520
Vincent.

344
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,720
- So what are you saying?
- What I`m saying?

345
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,840
You, me, her, on the road-- six weeks.

346
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
She`ll be a couple of years
catching her breath.

347
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,280
- Vincent, you know, these people
have got a baby-sitter--
- Hey, Lou, can you see I`m talking here?

348
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,480
Huh? Do me a favor, will ya?
Take care of`em.

349
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,720
He`s late for his coffee break.

350
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,280
Go on. Get back to work,
but think about it. Okay?

351
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,440
Take your time. I`ll give you
about five seconds.

352
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,560
''Five seconds.``

353
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,760
Listen, you know where to find me
if you wanna talk.

354
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,920
Vincent, don`t worry about it.

355
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,520
If I can hold you tonight

356
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,440
I might never let go

357
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,000
- If anybody asks, I`ll be in the back.
- If I can hold you tonight

358
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,040
- I might never let go
- If I can hold you tonight

359
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,480
- I might never
- Come on in.
- No, never let go

360
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,120
- If I can hold you tonight
- Hey, Eddie.

361
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,400
Uh, I don`t know. What we were
talking about yesterday...

362
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,760
I just wanted to ask you
some questions about it, you know.

363
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,240
Um, what happens? You know.
I mean, what happens? I--

364
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,480
God. Goddamn.

365
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
It`s a Balabushka.

366
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,640
It`s beautiful.

367
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,160
Geez, it makes the other ones
look like stickball bats.

368
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,520
- Is this yours?
- You want it?

369
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,960
No. I can`t-- This isn`t for me.

370
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,120
Uh, I don`t know who this is for.
This is, uh--

371
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,000
No, this isn`t for me.

372
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,880
I don`t know. I mean,John Wayne
would carry something like this...

373
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,800
if he played pool, you know.

374
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,760
Babe Ruth. I--

375
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,680
Oh, my--

376
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,000
No. I-- I can`t accept this.

377
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,600
Go ahead. Take it.

378
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,240
- You`re pushing pretty hard.
- You betcha.

379
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,360
I`ve been thinking about
nothing else all day.

380
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,280
- If I can hold you tonight
- I don`t know what to tell you, Eddie.

381
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,800
- I`ve got a lot of things going on right now.
- Whatever. Hey, whatever. It doesn`t matter.

382
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,640
Go outside. Horse around with it.
If you don`t like it, bring it back.

383
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,200
If I can hold you tonight
I might never, no, never let go

384
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,160
Eddie. Hey, Eddie.

385
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,920
Uh, you know, I was talking to Carmen
the other night, feeling her out.

386
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,120
Oh, Willie. I`m sorry. Hol--
Wait a minute.

387
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,120
Sorry. Go ahead.

388
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,520
I said I was talking to Carmen the other
night and feeling her out, you know.

389
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,440
Uh, I think you`re wrong, man,
you know.

390
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,200
She`s doing good.
She`s doing real good.

391
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,640
Okay. I`m glad I`m wrong.
Willie.

392
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,840
No, I don`t. Oh, I can make it
in half an hour...

393
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,760
45 minutes-- something like that.

394
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,000
Sure.

395
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,640
Where`s, uh--
Where`s Carmen, my girlfriend?

396
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
- Uh, she just went in the bathroom.
- Bathroom?

397
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
- Know what this is?
- Man.

398
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,680
Balabushka.

399
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,600
- Balabushka?
- Yeah.

400
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,240
- Where`d you get a Balabushka at?
- Eddie. Eddie, uh, Felson gave it to me.

401
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,760
- Eddie Felson gave you a Balabushka?
- Yeah.

402
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,440
- That`s a pretty good gift.
You know what that`s worth?
- Yeah.

403
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,480
- That guy died about 10 or 15 years ago.
- Oh, yeah.
- It`s gotta be a collector`s item by now.
- Yeah.

404
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,600
And still you fire up
Snakes in the garden

405
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,760
Apples on the tree

406
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,040
All of this looks easy

407
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,960
None of this is real

408
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,880
You might get lucky

409
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,800
Got the will to win

410
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,080
Need a little failure

411
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,440
To thicken your skin, well

412
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,560
Everybody's talking

413
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,120
They promise you the moon

414
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,920
It's made of paper
And you'll find out pretty soon

415
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,360
Who owns this place

416
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,680
Who
Who owns this place

417
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm talking to you
And I love you, my babe

418
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,120
It`s-- It`s my word against yours,
right? I`m a middle-aged Jewish man.
I`m a rare-book expert.

419
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,680
- Have you seen my girlfriend,Julian?
- She went out.

420
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,200
- Out where?
- Hey, she`s your girlfriend, man.

421
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,320
- Where was I?
- I love you too

422
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,720
Hey, is, uh, everything okay?

423
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
- Yeah.
- Where`d you go?

424
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,160
- I went out to get cigs.
- They sell cigarettes right here.

425
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
So I went across the street to get `em.
So what?

426
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,120
Oh, you needed some fresh air, right?

427
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,880
What`s your problem?

428
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
No problem. I don`t-- Did I say
I have a problem? There`s no problem.

429
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,280
- I`m glad to hear it.
- I just didn`t know where you went.

430
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,760
- You know, I was looking for ya.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,600
- I`m gonna sit down now. Is that okay?
- Yeah.

432
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,200
I might go to the bathroom again
in about a half hour. Is that okay?

433
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,720
- That`s great, Carmen.
- Yeah. I`ll be sure and tell you
when though, okay?

434
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,000
Hey, look.

435
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,560
- I just didn`t know where you went. All right?
- Come on.

436
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,560
I was looking for you. Let`s not make
a federal production out of this, okay?

437
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,480
Okay!

438
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,440
Okay.

439
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,000
- It`s a Balabushka. Eddie gave it to me.
- Great.

440
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,800
The twilight passes
I need a change

441
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,960
Ship down to see them
That's all been arranged

442
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,200
Take everything

443
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,320
We can today

444
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,320
Who owns this place

445
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Push, pull

446
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,440
Push, pull

447
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,800
- Push, pull
- Excuse me.

448
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,080
Eddie, uh,
I`ve been thinking about it.

449
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,080
Let`s do it. Okay?

450
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,040
Great.

451
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,360
- I wonder what`s upstairs.
- Why?

452
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,640
Well, there might be somethin` soft...

453
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,520
for you to lean against.

454
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,760
So you don`t crush your skirt.

455
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,520
What do they do in the Bahamas?
Do they tango or rumba?

456
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
Samba, I think.

457
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,280
How`s that Old McDonnell working out?

458
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,040
- You`re drinkin` it now.
- Are you serious?

459
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,800
- It`s good stuff.
- It`s very good stuff.

460
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,600
Yo, Eddie, man. Hey.

461
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,120
Why don`t you look in the mirror
before you leave the john, huh?

462
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,080
I hate that shit.

463
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,000
Better than that shit.

464
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,840
Hey, listen, Eddie. You gonna be
around Monday? There`s a guy
I got set up in Camden.

465
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,360
No. I`m gonna be out of town
for a couple of weeks.

466
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,520
Bullshit.

467
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,480
What? You taking that guy
on the road? What`s his name?

468
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,480
- I don`t know his name,
and it`s none of your business.
- The guy`s a chump.

469
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,560
What he do? Beat me one night. I`ll
put the nine ball up both your asses.

470
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,600
Are you serious?
Taking him on the road?

471
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,640
When was the last time
you did the road? 1960?

472
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,560
They didn`t even have cars then.

473
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,440
What?

474
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,960
Come on. You banging his girlfriend?

475
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,720
Right? You can tell me.

476
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,240
- Jesus, you are the best,Julian.
- Let me play him again tonight.

477
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,840
- Winner gets in the car with you.
- No. You`re the best,Julian.

478
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,720
You know, Eddie, you`re not the only
stake horse around. You know that?

479
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,880
Yeah. I`ll see you
in Atlantic City. Okay?

480
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
Don`t look too hard for me, okay?

481
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
Hey. We are going to the Bahamas.
I just didn`t say when.

482
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,360
Appreciate hearing about it
from that dope fiend.

483
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,560
I didn`t want to tell anybody! What if I
get on the road, the kid doesn`t work out?

484
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,120
- That makes me feel great, Eddie. Great.
- That guy sucks, man.

485
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,520
- And so do you.
- All right, all right. I am wrong.

486
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,280
- Uh-huh. But let me do it my way!
- Do it any way you want to do it, Eddie.

487
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,280
- Yeah. What I want is I just want to go
on the road. I don`t want to tell anybody.
- Fine!

488
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,960
If you got anything that you need
at my apartment, you`ll find it
in a suitcase out front, okay?

489
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,920
Hey, wait a--

490
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,520
I`m sorry.

491
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,680
I cover all expenses. Food, room,
everything. Entry fees, everything.

492
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,360
For that I get 60% of everything
you win-- all bets.

493
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,720
I lay the bets, so I also
take the losses if you lose.

494
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,640
So, for that, I get 60% of what you win.

495
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,520
Sixty percent?
What are ya, a slumlord?

496
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,520
Honey, you find a newcomer with a better
deal than that, you come to me. We talk.

497
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,080
Don`t worry.
I am not gonna lose often.

498
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,040
Oh, yes, you will.
That`s what I`m gonna teach ya.

499
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,200
Sometimes if you lose, you win. Go.

500
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,120
So who`s the heaviest guy?

501
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,640
What do you ask that for?
I`m the heaviest guy. Right, Eddie?

502
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,400
Oh, it doesn`t make any sense.
It goes in streaks.

503
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,920
- The balls roll funny for everybody, kiddo.
- Streaks?

504
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,600
There is this guy-- Grady Seasons.
He`s making the most money
straight up on paper, but...

505
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,520
- Grady Seasons?
- that doesn`t mean anything.

506
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,440
- Grady Seasons.
- The real money`s in the practice room.

507
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,440
That`s where you get a good game.

508
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,680
I mean, a guy can get wiped out in
the first day of the tournament and...

509
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,240
hang around the practice room for
a couple of days and make more money
than the guy who won the tournament.

510
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,200
- Did you hear that?
- What?
- The practice room!

511
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,160
Hey. Watch the paint.

512
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,280
What? Oh.

513
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,400
- Is that metal on your jacket?
- Sorry.
- Sorry about that.
- Shit.

514
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,840
Rub-a-dub,
here comes the grub.

515
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,440
My pancakes are burned.

516
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,360
What`s this? No, no, wait a minute.
We ordered four on two up.

517
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,440
- I don`t want sausage.
- Sorry. I must have given you
the wrong order.

518
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,960
- That`s a dead giveaway.
- What is?

519
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,480
- Uh, the four on two.
- Oh. Egg talk.

520
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,360
Yeah, she was the killer waitress
at the Acropolis.

521
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,240
- Yes.
- And she did them a favor and quit. Ow.

522
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,960
What do you think?
He`s the only one who has to work?

523
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,280
How come you don`t play pool anymore?

524
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,200
I quit.

525
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,600
Actually, somebody retired me.

526
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,040
Sometimes you get in
with the wrong kind of people, you know?

527
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,040
But, hey, that was a long time ago.
Back East. It`s dead and buried.

528
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,240
I don`t even think about it.
I won my share of medals.

529
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,000
Hey, don`t you ever, uh,
feel like picking it up again?

530
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,520
I mean, you`re always around those pool
halls, you know. You see these guys--

531
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,000
Ah, I`m too old. My wheels are shot.
It`s a young man`s game.

532
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,680
Beside, there`s drugs now. You know.
Kids are playing on coke, speed.

533
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,240
I don`t know. When I was younger
it was booze.

534
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,840
It somehow was more human.

535
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,800
- Booze, huh?
- Booze. Yeah.

536
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,720
Wine.
It goes back to the Bible.

537
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,280
The Bible never said
anything about amphetamines.

538
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,920
- Are you religious, Eddie?
- Me?

539
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I get high on the man upstairs.

540
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,800
Isn`t there a masters tournament
you can play in?

541
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,520
I mean, I`ve seen this on television,
you know, them old golfers and stuff.

542
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
Like an old timers` tournament?

543
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,760
If you`re too old to cut the mustard,
you can still lick the jar, right?

544
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,160
Nobody ever asked me for a refund,
honey.

545
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,800
Not yet.

546
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,720
Hey. Now, we`re just
talking around things here.

547
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,400
It ain`t about pool.
It ain`t about sex. It ain`t about love.

548
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,320
It`s about money.

549
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,880
I mean, the best is the guy
with the most. That`s the whole show.

550
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
The best is the guy with the most
in all walks of life.

551
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,400
Are you the best liquor salesman?

552
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,320
You betcha.

553
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,640
Ahh, what a way
to get your feet wet, kid.

554
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,040
This place is an all-time classic.

555
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,960
Hey. Hey, hey.

556
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,440
- Put that cue stick in the trunk.
- What am I gonna play with?

557
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,360
You`ll play with a house cue.

558
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,360
You go in there with that, nobody
will come near you with a nickel.

559
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,320
I can`t believe it.
I got goose bumps.

560
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,320
I love it. We`ll just sit and watch
for a while. I gotta see this guy.

561
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,040
I can`t wait to see what`s next.

562
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,240
Good-- Good thing I-- Good thing
I didn`t bring the Balabushka, huh?

563
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,920
Sixty percent-- are we gonna
divvy this up in the car?

564
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,880
Enough!

565
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,400
Great. Nice.

566
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,840
Had enough,junior?

567
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,200
Hold on.

568
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,720
- What the hell are you doing, Vincent?
Beat him, eat him and get out of here.
- I know. I know.

569
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,080
I can`t take this guy`s money.

570
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,960
- He`s got a hole in his throat.
- So what?

571
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,560
The guy`s breakin` my heart, man.
Look at-- Look at him.

572
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,920
He looks like he`s on his last legs.

573
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,400
I mean, what is it so far, 60 bucks?
It`s no big deal.

574
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,360
No big deal?

575
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,240
- You want me to quit?
- Yeah.

576
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,160
If you`re gonna keep on
dumping like this.

577
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,120
Unless--
Show me.

578
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
Make it a real performance. Show me
you can dump like a professional.
It`ll be worth it.

579
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,040
Like a professional?

580
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,120
Okay, chief.
Play you for 30.

581
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,040
- Go on out and get the car.
- Why? What for?

582
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,200
Just bring it around front.
Head it that way.

583
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,040
- Okay, but that`s the wrong way, Eddie.
- Just do what I tell ya.

584
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,040
Yeah, right.

585
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,920
Easy shot. I miss this
I`m a real chump, huh?

586
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,880
Easy. Straight in.

587
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
It`s-- The tough one`s the four though.

588
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,520
Huh? I don`t know.

589
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,720
Oh, my God. I--

590
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,120
Holy--

591
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
Oh, my God. Do you b--

592
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Don`t-- Don`t even bother.
I just can`t hit nothin`.

593
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,040
- That`s it.
- Jesus!

594
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,080
- That`s it, kid. Where`s the money?
- Yeah, I know. That`s it. Hol--

595
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,720
Uh, Eddie?

596
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,520
- Eddie.
- Where`s that money, you little prick?

597
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,560
What are you talk--
Hey, Eddie`s got the money.

598
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,160
- Did you see where they went?
Where`d they go?
- Hey, it looks like they left.

599
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,680
Hey, relax. Take it easy. What are you--
What the fuck`s the matter with you guys?

600
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,360
Take-- Get your fuckin` hands off-- Whoa!
Come on. I`m gonna get your money.

601
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,520
What the fuck are you doing?
Just hold it.Just relax.

602
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,440
Hold it! Hey, easy!
Take it easy!

603
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,360
Hey!

604
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,760
Okay! Enough!
Come on.

605
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,560
Come on.
I`m his father.

606
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,560
- Father?
- You little bastard! Huh?

607
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,840
What do I do? I tell you not to play.
I tell you to play.

608
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,440
Aah! Ease off. Family.
Get out of here.

609
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,440
Yo-yo.

610
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,240
You little punk! I hope
your mother kicks the shit out of you.

611
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,400
Okay. Go, go, go, go!

612
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,000
- Drive!
- Where to? Where?
- Just take the parkway south.

613
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,960
- All right, all right.
- You never--

614
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
Damn it. You never ease off
on somebody like that...

615
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,960
not when there`s
money involved.

616
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,840
That`s the problem of mercy, kid.
It just ain`t professional.

617
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,280
Let me look at your face.

618
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,200
Ah, you`ll live.
You`re gonna live, right?

619
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,480
Get out of my face, will ya?
Jesus Christ.

620
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,160
- ''My father.``
- Saved your ass.

621
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,600
Carmen, what`s to be
learned from this?

622
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,600
Nice guys finish last.

623
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,880
Oh, is that original,
or you just make that up?

624
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,800
Oh, Vincent. You look so sexy
with that bloody lip.

625
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,160
Shut up.

626
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,080
- Do you guys want me to drive?
- No, I`m good.

627
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,040
- Slimy son of a bitch.
- What?

628
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,200
That guy. The hole. The--

629
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Stick a pool cue down his throat.
Go back there with a fucking cannon
and blow all their asses away!

630
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,240
Oh, Vincent, that`s gross.

631
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,440
- Next time, kid.
- I`m sorry.

632
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,480
One of you guys know
where the Triant Motel is?

633
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,600
The what? The what?
Yeah.

634
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,440
- Tri-- Triant Motel.
- Yeah, yeah.

635
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,920
Go left on Aurora
and right on Seneca.

636
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,920
- Chalkie`s still around?
- Chalkie`s?

637
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,880
- Yeah. It`s a pool hall.
- I know what it is, man.

638
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,080
Yeah, it`s still around.
What, it`s supposed to move somewhere?

639
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,080
Some things never change, eh?

640
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,080
Man, I wouldn`t bet on it.

641
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,720
- Eddie.
- Enter.

642
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,120
Hey, good morning.

643
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,840
What`s happening?
Come on. Let`s get going, guys.

644
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,040
I`m ordering room service.
You want anything?

645
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,280
The Mississippi Valley
and parts of the Tennessee Valley--

646
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,200
- Food. You hungry?
- We are also--

647
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,040
- I hate the weather.
- For the Chicago area--

648
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,120
Can`t get room service in a motel.

649
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,040
Come on. Let`s check out Chalkie`s.
Tell your girlfriend to get goin`.

650
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,280
Meet you out
downstairs in the lobby.

651
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,480
Well, what about food?
I`m starved.

652
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,360
- Vincent.
- Yeah?

653
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,600
Don`t change the shirt.
It`s a nice touch.

654
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,920
- The shirt?
- And leave the cue stick.

655
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,840
What the hell`s
the use of having it?

656
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,200
This used to be a nice, average
bad neighborhood. Now look at it.

657
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah. Look at this.
All the places gonna be like this?

658
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,920
I mean, on your pool hall scale
of one to 10, what do you rate this?

659
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,200
- Ten.
- At least this one`s got tables.

660
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,680
- Hi, guys.
- How you doin`?

661
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,560
Squeeze me in?

662
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,480
Table number seven for Fast Eddie.

663
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,480
It's in the way that you use it

664
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,640
Yeah, so you don`t recognize
Orvis from way back when.

665
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,760
- Boy, don't you know
- You son of a bitch.

666
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,880
- What the hell are you doin` here?
- Now you`re startin` to remember.
- It's in the way that you use it

667
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,000
- How long you want it for?
- A couple hours.

668
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,600
- Hmm.
- Geez, the last time I saw you
you were sweeping up at McGeer`s.

669
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,200
Sweeping up at McGeer`s.
That`s right.

670
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,640
Then I started working here
for Chalkie...

671
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,520
till he got scared of a bad element
moving in and sold out.

672
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,840
Since then I`ve been runnin` Chalkie`s.

673
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,560
Well, what can I do for ya?
Lookin` for some action?

674
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,440
Usually I steer for 20%,
but for you it`s 10.

675
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,000
Sure, but not me.
My friend here wants a game.

676
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,400
- How you doin`, Orvis?
- No one gets lucky

677
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,160
Till luck comes along

678
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,760
- Nobody's lonely
- Wild place you got here.
- Till somebody's gone

679
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,440
It's in the way that you use it

680
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,840
What you doin`, Eddie,
stake-horsin`?

681
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,040
- It comes and it goes
- You know who you got here
stake-horsin` for you?

682
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,200
- This here`s Fast Eddie Felson.
- It's in the way that you use it

683
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,280
Who the hell are you,
the end of the world?

684
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,360
- Come on. Ease--
Ease it up, will ya, Orvis?
- It comes and it goes

685
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,600
Him I`ll steer for 15 since he`s staked
by Fast Eddie the stake horse.

686
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,560
What you playin`,
nine ball or straight?

687
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,240
I`ll set it up for ya.

688
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,040
The table`ll cost you $12.

689
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,520
It's in the way that you use it

690
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,360
- Maybe you should go back to the motel.
- Why?

691
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,640
Why? What, are you kidding me?
Take a look around this place.

692
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,560
There`s gotta be
tons of rape artists here. ''Why?``

693
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
- Maybe you should go back to the motel.
- Me?

694
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,880
- Pretty boy like you.
- Cut it out.
- Cute boy like you.

695
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,840
- I`m serious.
- Ooh, you`re such a cute boy.
- Carmen.
- Vincent.

696
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,000
- Hey.
- Not here.
- Let me give you the scoop, killer.

697
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,080
See that guy with the tiepin
in his nose over there?

698
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,880
- Hmm?
- Yeah.
- Okay. That`s Moselle.

699
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,360
- Him we stay away from.
- Don't you ever abuse it
- No shit.

700
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,960
Grow up. Him we stay away from
`cause he`s the main stick around here.

701
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,520
You beat him, scares away
that gentleman over there.

702
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,680
- Who`s he?
- That`s Earl.

703
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,520
He comes in here and he`s got
$5,000, $6,000 in his pocket.

704
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,480
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

705
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,480
Runs the numbers.
Orvis says he don`t mind losing.

706
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,400
He just don`t like to give it away.

707
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,800
So, you beat Moselle...

708
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,240
and old Earl over there loses interest.

709
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,280
- What happens now?
- Uh, nothin` for a little while.

710
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,320
We`ll play over here.

711
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,040
He`ll be watchin` ya,
and he`ll come to ya.

712
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,480
- Who am I gonna play?
- Me.

713
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,640
You? Okay.

714
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,880
Eddie, but before we go,
I want her to go back to the motel.

715
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,720
- Oh, Christ.
- I`m sorry, but this place
is goddamn bird land.

716
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,800
Look, I been in worse places.
I dated worse guys.

717
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,200
- Hey, Carmen.
- You have? Who?
- Hey! Watch your hands.

718
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,080
- Who?
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Vincent!

719
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,000
- Okay. That`s enough. That`s enough.
- You gotta tell me.
- Okay, okay.
- Let go, Vincent.

720
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,920
- Vincent!
- That`s enough.

721
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,040
Orvis`ll get you a cab
back to the hotel.

722
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,640
- I don`t want a damn cab.
- Carmen, Carmen.
- Goddamn it!

723
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,480
Jesus Christ!

724
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,360
Okay, no thunderbolt breaks,
no runs over four balls.

725
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,320
Just take it nice and easy.

726
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,320
She never went out with
any guys like this.

727
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Vincent, will you pay attention?

728
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,640
That guy Earl is paying attention.

729
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,000
- Oh, what a fool
- Are you listening to me?

730
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,920
Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,080
I needed someone

732
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,120
You want me to break,
or you want to break?

733
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,320
- To call my own
- No, I`ll break.

734
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,280
What`d they do, saw the legs off this thing?
This is a table for dwarfs or something.

735
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,920
Ah, come on, Fast Eddie.

736
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,680
Let`s see some heavy legend action here.

737
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,200
I see 3 5 balls down there.

738
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,640
I'll never be

739
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,440
- Not bad, huh?
- Love came

740
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,240
This isn`t pool. This is for bangers.
Straight pool is pool.

741
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,320
This is like handball
or cribbage or something.

742
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,400
Straight pool you gotta be a--

743
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,280
a real surgeon to get over.

744
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,240
It was all finesse.

745
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,760
Now everything is nine ball
`cause it`s fast.

746
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,400
Good for TV.
Good for a loud break shot.

747
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,880
Oh, well. What the hell.
Checkers sells more than chess.

748
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,000
- Pretty damn good.
- Not bad for a blind man.

749
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,000
- Rack `em up.
- Yes, sir, boss.

750
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,520
- Rack `em up for Mr. Fast Eddie.
- I haven`t played serious pool
since before you were born...

751
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,040
and right off the bat
I`m laying `em to waste.

752
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,040
Watch this.
Nine on the break.

753
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,720
- Oh!
- Oh!Jesus, Eddie!

754
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,960
- Damn!
- All yours.

755
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
That was phenomenal.

756
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,440
I`d like to play that big dude Moselle.
I bet he ain`t that good.

757
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,240
Yeah?

758
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,560
I don`t know, Eddie.

759
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,560
Maybe you`re right.

760
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,040
Maybe this game is just for bangers.

761
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,760
She made a mountain oflove

762
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,440
- Cool it.
- But the thing is...

763
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,440
even if it is just for bangers,
everybody`s doin` it.

764
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,400
Everybody`s doin` it.

765
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,480
There`s a lot of guys doin` it.

766
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,160
A lot of guys doin` it...

767
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,360
but only one guy can, uh,
be the best.

768
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,080
Eddie. Hey.

769
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,360
Hey!

770
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,280
Eddie.

771
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,600
Eddie!
Eddie, what?

772
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,520
Where are you goin`?
All right. Hey.

773
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,720
Those were easy shots, man.

774
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,160
Come on.
All right. Okay.

775
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,280
I`m sorry. I`m a smart-ass.
I was showing off.

776
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,360
- I`m sorry. All right.
- You know what this is turning into?

777
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,400
- What?
- A waste of my time and a waste of my money.

778
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,200
Where are you goin`, huh?
Eddie, what--

779
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,560
You`re gonna leave me here?
What--

780
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,480
I don`t believe this guy!

781
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,800
Child care.

782
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,320
Eddie.

783
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,800
- I know how you feel about me.
- Vincent back?

784
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,560
- Yeah, but he`s out.
- What do you mean ''out``?

785
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,600
- ''Out`` like not in the room.
- Mind getting dressed?

786
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,600
Why, are we going somewheres?

787
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,960
A guy comes into the room.
What if I was somebody else?

788
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,960
- Like who?
- That`s not the point.

789
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,880
Look, I`m not naked or anything.

790
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,240
And another thing.
Work with me, not against me.

791
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,160
Don`t go saying to Vincent what you said
to him at Chalkie`s. Gets him all upset.

792
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,520
If you`re gonna use that thing,
use it right.

793
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,600
- Use what thing?
- Hal Lefty. Well,you know him, don't ya?

794
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,840
Yeah. Hejust got back from vacation.

795
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,880
- Come on.
- What are you doing?
- Me and you, huh?

796
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,400
- Ow! Let me go!
- I like it in the shower, huh?

797
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,600
- No!
- A quick one before Vincent gets back.
- Goddamn it!

798
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,520
All right? Hey.

799
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,160
I`m not your daddy. I`m not your boyfriend.
So don`t be playing games with me.

800
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,520
I`m your partner.

801
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,680
You don`t flirt with me,
you don`t come on with me.

802
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,120
- Take a shower, you shut the goddamn door.
- Don`t flatter yourself.

803
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,640
Geez. Don`t waste my time
with bullshit, Carmen.

804
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,640
Palm Springs for the NIHT.

805
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,800
That's the National Invitational
Handball Tournament.

806
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,120
Oh,yeah. He's really good at it,
aren't you?

807
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,440
We got a racehorse here.
A thoroughbred.

808
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,360
You make him feel good,
I teach him how to run.

809
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,800
Do you understand me?
We`re businesspeople.

810
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,040
Gotcha.

811
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,720
- Hey, get it off!.Oh.!
- Sure.

812
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,040
- Where`s the Balabushka?
- You what?

813
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,880
- Vincent took it.
- I thought you said he was out.

814
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,880
Yeah. He was in, he was out.

815
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,520
- He took the cue stick?
- Yes.

816
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,560
- And you let him?
- Well, so what?

817
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,040
No.! No, I don't want--

818
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,000
- Why, Laura?
- Shit.

819
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,160
Why are you so afraid?

820
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,720
- I`m sorry.
- Jesus. Goddamn!

821
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,840
- Child care!
- Oh, nothing, Laura. Nothing.

822
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,760
Shit.

823
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,000
Good game. Good game.

824
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,880
What you got in there?

825
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,800
In here?

826
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,800
Doom.

827
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,800
- Come on, boy. Let`s play.
- Yeah. Let`s play.

828
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,680
We`re gonna have a lot of fun.

829
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,000
Werewolves of London

830
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,000
He's the hairy-handed gent
who ran amok in Kent

831
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,760
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair

832
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,760
You better stay away from him

833
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,120
He'll rip your lungs out,Jim

834
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,600
Huh
I'd like to meet his tailor

835
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,560
Werewolves of London

836
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,600
Werewolves of London

837
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,360
Well, I saw Lon Chaney
walkin'with the queen

838
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,320
Doing the werewolves of London

839
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,520
I saw Lon Chaney,Jr. walking
with the queen

840
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,160
Doing the werewolves of London

841
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,760
I saw a werewolf drinking a piña colada
at Trader Vic's

842
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,480
- His hair was perfect
- His hair was perfect

843
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,360
Werewolves of London

844
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,320
Hah
Draw blood

845
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,360
All right. All right.

846
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,600
Not bad, my man.
Not bad.

847
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,320
- When you leaving town? Now, right?
- You don`t wanna play me again?

848
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,240
- Eh.
- Moselle, I`m joking. Don`t kill me.
All right? Please.

849
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,240
That boy`s hot.

850
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,840
Did you see me tonight?

851
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,560
Hey. What?

852
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,720
I ma-- I made money.

853
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,600
You lost money.
The town is dead for ya.

854
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,160
Now what the hell is it?
Do I not speak your native language?

855
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,520
- What is the matter?
- Look, you give me this stick, okay,
and then you tell me to lay low.

856
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,800
I mean, the goddamn thing, I lay it
down, it just jumps up at me, man.

857
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,920
You don`t deserve this stick.

858
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,320
I don`t deserve this?

859
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,360
You don`t deserve this stick!

860
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,840
All you do is you sit in there,
you talk. You know. You tell me things.

861
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,800
Did you see me in there tonight?
I played.

862
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,160
I`m a fuckin` pool player, Eddie.

863
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,840
You know something?
I`m a fuckin` animal!

864
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,840
Animal!

865
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,040
Vincent, get in the car.
This is embarrassing.

866
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,840
You`re acting like some girl
who got felt up in a drive-in.

867
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,880
It looks terrible.
Get in, will ya?

868
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,400
Tough shit.

869
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,280
How much did you take off of Moselle?
I heard a hundred.

870
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,000
- 150.
- 150?

871
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,760
Yeah. 150.

872
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,200
You walk into a shoe store with
150 bucks, you come out with one shoe!

873
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,360
We were working on 5,000.

874
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,520
Come on.
Get in. It`s cold.

875
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,000
Love me baby

876
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,360
- Vincent.
- Love me all night

877
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,040
Well, I gotta hand it to ya, kid.

878
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,960
You got me talking to myself.

879
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,880
I got half of me that says I got ahold
of the best thing that I ever seen...

880
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,560
and half of me that says
it just ain`t worth it.

881
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,600
I mean, either I don`t teach you right,
or you don`t listen.

882
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,600
Or you listen but you don`t hear.

883
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,960
What was that voodoo stuff back there?
That wasn`t pool. That was a circus.

884
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,200
You dropped your pants.

885
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,520
You wanna get known? Good.
You and Gypsy Rose Lee.

886
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,320
I can always go back to whiskey.
It`s been very good to me.

887
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,160
I mean, you`re sitting in it,
and I`m wearin` it.

888
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,880
But it`s tired.

889
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,960
You know, it`s just kind of run on.

890
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,680
All of a sudden you appear on the scene,
I`m jumpin` again.

891
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,720
You remind me that--
that money won...

892
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,000
is twice as sweet
as money earned.

893
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,440
Twenty-five years ago
I had the screws put on me.

894
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,560
I mean, it was over for me
before it really got started.

895
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,000
But I`m hungry again,
and you bled that back into me.

896
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,440
You gotta have two things to win.

897
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,760
You gotta have brains,
and you gotta have balls.

898
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,520
Now you`ve got too much of one
and not enough of the other.

899
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,560
I mean--

900
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,040
I don`t know.
Just tell me what you want to do.

901
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,520
Give me a clue.

902
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,640
Uh...

903
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,560
yeah.

904
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,880
I`ll try.
Uh, I`ll really try.

905
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,160
You know? Let`s go for it.

906
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,320
You know, Eddie,
I mean, uh--

907
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,960
It`s just tough for me
to lay down, you know? It`s just--

908
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,400
I get in there, and it`s just--
it`s just tough.

909
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,960
It`s just, uh,
just tough to lay down.

910
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,560
But I`ll try. Okay?

911
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,880
Tough to lay down, huh?

912
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,440
Well, roll over, sweetheart.
Gimme.

913
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,920
- What?
- Ninety bucks.

914
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,920
Sixty percent of 150 is 90 bucks.

915
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,640
I wake you up?

916
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,320
Well, do you want to hang up?

917
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,760
Are you still pissed off at me?

918
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,680
Well, uh, if you were, uh,
I`d understand.

919
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,640
I don`t know. Uh, I`m having
nightmares, sweats and everything.

920
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,600
What kind of rent
are you paying?

921
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,760
I said, what kind of rent
do you pay?

922
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,760
Well, listen.

923
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,000
After the Bahamas...

924
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,200
maybe you could
move in with me...

925
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,120
just for practice.

926
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,440
What do you mean? No, nothing`s
going on. What are you, a shrink?

927
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,040
I miss you.
I say nice things to you.

928
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,760
Fine.

929
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,640
Uh, a couple of curve balls
every now and then.

930
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,840
They`re young. They`re kids.
No, no. You`re perfect.

931
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,680
I love this. Hey. Carmen, you should
have seen Eddie play last night.

932
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,400
- You were terrific.
- Are we going to make some money today, or
am I still talking to Our Lady of the Cue Balls?

933
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
We`ll make some money.
Definitely.

934
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,080
I`m a wild man today.

935
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,040
Did you ever hear of a hustle
called two brothers and a stranger?

936
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,040
Uh, yeah. That`s the guy in the Bible
with the many-colored coats, right?

937
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,840
Jesus, Vincent.

938
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,160
Hey, I`m joking, you guys.
Come on. I`m-- I`m just--

939
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,200
Did I get through to you
last night, kid?

940
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,680
`Cause if I didn`t,
I`ll run it by you another way.

941
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,160
If you`d have kicked ass
in any other place but Chalkie`s...

942
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,360
Atlantic City would
be dead for us.

943
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,680
The guys never
leave the street.

944
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,280
Otherwise, it would
be all around.

945
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,800
Hey, let me tell you
something. Uh--

946
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,440
Last night-- You know, people never
talked to me like that before.

947
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,320
You really talked to me.

948
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,160
And just I want you to know
that I appreciate it.

949
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,880
- And...
- Okay.

950
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,040
I want to thank you, you know,
for everything.

951
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,120
Uh--

952
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,640
Don`t worry, kid.
Don`t worry.

953
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,320
Two brothers and a stranger.
Okay?

954
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,080
You got two guys
that go into a bar, see?

955
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,360
Give me two hours, they`ll be
building me a trophy wall in there, huh?

956
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,960
Look at that kid.
He gets to have all the fun.

957
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,800
Lock and load.

958
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,640
All right. Who`s next here?
You guys, you want to play? No? Anybody.

959
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,400
You-- You want to play?
What about you? You want to play?

960
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,920
- Forget it.
- Spot you the break here.

961
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,840
Come on, I`ll spot you
the break. How `bout it?

962
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,040
- I want the seven ball too.
- Seven.

963
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,800
How about the eight?
I`ll give you the eight.

964
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,200
Come on. The eight, the break.
What do you want? All right? You up?

965
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,760
Let`s go.

966
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,120
Why don`t you keep it down, huh?

967
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,600
What did I say?
I coughed.

968
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,240
- Well.
- Stop it, Eddie.

969
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,520
- Do you mind?
- Excuse me?

970
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,920
I said, do you mind? I mean,
It`s a money game here, guy. Okay?

971
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,000
- Big money game.
- Yeah, that`s right. A big money game.

972
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,200
So why don`t you take your hands
off the girl and let us play, okay, guy?

973
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,320
What do you care
where I put my hand?

974
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,240
- Why don`t you mind your own business.
- Hey, Gramps.

975
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,680
Put your teeth back in, get your hands
off your daughter there and pay attention.
You just might learn something here today.

976
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,160
I`ll change my teeth,
you change your goddamn diapers.

977
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,240
Hey, we`ve got
a game going here.

978
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,960
Really? What are you
playing for?

979
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,880
- What`s it to you?
- What are you playing for?

980
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,600
- Fifty.
- You want to win?

981
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,960
I`ll bet 500 bucks
on this guy right here.

982
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,640
Huh?

983
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,520
I think you`re a choker, kiddo. Five
hundred bucks says you choke right now.

984
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,720
- Why don`t you take a walk, asshole?
- Anybody want to bet 500 bucks
the kid chokes?

985
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,160
- Come on. What are you starting trouble for?
- Eddie, cut it out.
- I`m not starting any trouble.

986
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,040
- You`re starting trouble.
- Come on. Any takers?
- Eddie, I`m gonna leave.

987
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,720
- Any takers?
- This guy`s a jerk.
- Want to go for a thousand?

988
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,120
I know. I mean, you`d think
he would have seen it before.

989
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,440
What-- Oh, my God,
he got suckered into that so good.

990
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,960
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

991
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,600
- Hey.
- What`s up? What do you think?

992
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,640
- Get in the car.
- Hey.

993
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,560
- Get away from me.
- Hey, hey. Vincent! What the hell
is the matter with you?

994
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,240
- Did you have a good time? Huh, Eddie?
- I`m a little disappointed
in you, frankly.

995
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,000
''Frankly,`` huh? Well, frankly, your ass!
I seen you, man.

996
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,160
- Seen what?
- Don`t give me that. I seen you!
- Seen what? Seen what?

997
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,600
Screw this. You know what I mean?
I don`t need this. I`m gone.

998
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,000
I`m going home.
Come on, Carmen. We`re going home.

999
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:39,200
- The hell you are.
- Oh, the hell I am?
- You`re going home alone, man.

1000
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,000
Oh, is that right?
Now I`m going home alone.

1001
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,560
Yeah, what, is it you and Eddie now?
Are you gonna go to bars and get
felt up by Eddie? Is that it?

1002
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,160
- Vincent.
- Come on.
- Vincent.

1003
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,600
You go in that place,
you play your part. It`s nice, huh?

1004
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,240
I put my hands on her,
I`m playing a part. It`s acting.

1005
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,840
- Your hands were all over her, Eddie!
- I`m acting! It`s acting!

1006
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,680
Hey, look, Vincent, when you--
when you go into movies...

1007
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,400
and you see people kissing, what do you--
what do you think, they go home together?

1008
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,320
- They`re professionals, Vincent.
- We`re just trying to be professionals.

1009
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,840
Okay, you guys.
It was just a little rough. Okay?

1010
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,360
- I mean, I-- You know,
I ain`t used to that, Carmen.
- Vincent. Vincent.

1011
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,880
- I-I don`t know about this.
- Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.

1012
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,520
Vincent the kid, huh?

1013
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,040
You are gonna be
one of the greats, kiddo.

1014
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,280
- One of the greats.
I got a good feeling about this.
- Yeah?

1015
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,080
You say it's black
and you know it's white

1016
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,480
You say it's day
when you know it's night

1017
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,960
You say it's good
and you know it's mean

1018
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,800
It's the finest music
that I ever seen

1019
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,120
Don't tell me nothin'

1020
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,520
Don't you tell me nothin'

1021
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,280
Don't tell me nothin'
I can see

1022
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,440
That rock and roll is good for me

1023
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,280
You say it's a dog
when you know it's a cat

1024
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,760
You say it's a mouse
when you know it's a rat

1025
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,960
You say it's meat
and you know it's bread

1026
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,880
You tell me it's gold
and it's a hunk oflead

1027
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,240
No, don't you tell me nothin'

1028
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,680
Oh, don't you tell me nothin'

1029
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,440
Don't tell me nothin'
I can see

1030
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,440
That rock and roll is good for me

1031
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,840
No, don't you tell me nothin'

1032
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,560
Don't you tell me nothin'

1033
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,160
You say it's right
and you know it's wrong

1034
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,480
You say it's short
and you know it's long

1035
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,840
You say it's low
when you know it's high

1036
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,280
Tell me the truth
and don't tell no lie

1037
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,160
Tell me nothin'

1038
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,480
Don't you tell me nothin'

1039
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,160
Don't you tell me nothin'
I can see

1040
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:36,200
- That rock and rollin'is good for me
- This is too much. No, really.
- Don't you tell me nothin'

1041
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,000
I can`t-- Are you sure
you don`t want to play again? I mean--

1042
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,800
Do you smell what I smell?

1043
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,400
Smoke?

1044
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,000
Money.

1045
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,320
Let`s take a stroll around.
See what`s what.

1046
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,200
A starry black sky revealed

1047
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,800
Somewhere in America

1048
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,040
I can feel the tears

1049
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,280
All lost and alone

1050
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,360
And I feel

1051
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,960
Hey.

1052
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,360
Check out that guy
that`s playing back there.

1053
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,440
- That guy?
- Yeah.

1054
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,600
This is a golden opportunity.
You know who that is?

1055
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,600
That`s Grady Seasons. He`s the best
money player in the world.

1056
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,720
That`s Grady Seasons?

1057
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,800
You want me to play him?

1058
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,880
You bet.

1059
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,160
And you are gonna dump. You are
gonna lose something fierce.

1060
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,080
You`re gonna ask for a spot and you`re
gonna ask for the break. Everything.

1061
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,040
It`s gonna be humiliating.
This is beautiful.

1062
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,680
- What do you mean, dump?
- What do I mean, dump?

1063
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,240
Because if you lose bad now
to this guy...

1064
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,920
you`ll be a super nobody in Atlantic City,
and the odds on you will drop to nothing.

1065
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,840
- Right?
- See? She learns.

1066
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,640
Let me ask you something. I mean,
I seen these guys, they hustle and they win.

1067
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,600
How come I always got to play the jerk?
I mean, why can`t we have a hustle
where I win?

1068
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,960
Because this is better than that. I mean,
there`s something at the end of this.

1069
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,680
I wouldn`t even tell you to do it
unless the payoff was phenomenal.

1070
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,680
Look, do whatever you want to do.
Do it your way. Whatever you want.

1071
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,640
I`m gonna play. I mean, I ask this guy
a question, he gets his panties in a bunch.

1072
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,760
It`s like a nightmare, isn`t it?

1073
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,280
It just keeps getting
worse and worse, doesn`t it?

1074
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,600
Are you gonna fall for this

1075
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,040
We're gonna pay hell for it

1076
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,760
And now we can win for it

1077
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,680
- The impossible dream.
- We'll let ourselves in for it

1078
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,520
Wild calculation

1079
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,800
Exert fascination

1080
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,760
Tame speculation

1081
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,720
And let ourselves in for it

1082
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,240
Don`t choke now.
It`s not that hard a shot.

1083
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,480
- Did you just say ''Don`t choke now``?
- Yeah. You heard me.

1084
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,640
Yeah.
Yeah, I heard you.

1085
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,240
And let ourselves in for it

1086
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,160
And we're bound to make the most of it

1087
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,520
Let's get the best of it
Let yourself in

1088
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,400
Any way that you figure it

1089
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,760
We got it at our fingertips

1090
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,000
Gotta give in

1091
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,280
Hey, Grady. Up your ass
with the spot. Okay with you?

1092
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,920
That`s fine with me.

1093
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,320
How you doing?

1094
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,240
- Carmen...
- Hmm?
- I`m playing here.

1095
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,280
Yeah, I know. I know. Listen.

1096
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,320
You win one more game, you`re gonna
be humping your fist for a long time.

1097
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,400
Okay, Vincent?

1098
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,080
Got that?

1099
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,920
Let's disprove the allegation

1100
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,560
No longer recreation

1101
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,240
What are you doing,
meditating?

1102
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,920
Get yourself into it

1103
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,600
Yeah?

1104
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,920
Yeah? Hey.

1105
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,840
- Can I have the Balabushka?
- Yeah.

1106
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,200
- Are you gonna play, Eddie?
- Yeah, maybe.

1107
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,720
Where?

1108
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,200
- I don`t know. Gunther`s.
- Gunther`s?

1109
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,160
- Want me to go with you?
- No, that`s okay.
- You`re not mad at me, are ya?

1110
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,840
- About last night?
- No. You done good.

1111
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,200
- Where`s he going?
- He`s going to Gunther`s.Ja.

1112
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,560
Hey, Bill.

1113
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,600
Why don`t you call Dud?

1114
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,360
Just about to lose my mind

1115
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,600
Never gonna let your love

1116
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,800
Thank you.

1117
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,120
Bill, I`ll have another Drambuie
and potato salad.

1118
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,320
And while you`re at it, give my friend
Eddie here anotherJTS Brown.

1119
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,480
- One more time?
- Absolutely.

1120
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,640
You know, you remind me a lot...

1121
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,200
of a guy I played
about 20 years ago.

1122
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:45,160
Matter of fact, it was right after that
that five of us went on a road trip...

1123
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,800
to San Antonio.

1124
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,120
We didn`t get any action.
The windup was...

1125
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,720
all five of us ended up
playing each other.

1126
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,320
That`s all she wrote.

1127
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,720
- Nice book, though.
- Buy you one?

1128
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,360
No, I`ll buy you one.
I`m gonna play for a while.

1129
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,360
It`s crazy, you know? I mean...

1130
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,080
I was working at this job, busting
my butt for about a year and a half.

1131
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,920
They didn`t give me a raise.

1132
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,400
So my old lady, she leaves me
`cause she says I`m a bum...

1133
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,920
`cause I quit.

1134
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,560
Then after, I get this job
working at the university...

1135
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,680
strictly for the experience.

1136
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,120
- Guess what it was.
- What?

1137
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,120
- What?
- Well, what were you?

1138
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,560
- I was a subject.
- A what?

1139
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,480
A subject
in the psych department.

1140
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,960
I was a subject
for experiments--

1141
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,000
reflexes, memory things.

1142
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,320
Except for I didn`t do anything
where I got that electric shock.

1143
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,920
Well, I did just once, but I just did that
for the experience, so it don`t count.

1144
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,600
Thank you.

1145
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,360
Okay.

1146
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,760
That`s 80.

1147
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,760
- Do it again?
- Yeah, sure, I don`t care.

1148
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,400
- Double or nothing?
- ''Double or nothing``?

1149
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,960
What is there, an echo in here?

1150
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,080
Let`s just do it, all right?
Let`s play.

1151
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,600
Eddie, how you doing?

1152
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,120
- Holding my own and a little bit of his.
- Good man.

1153
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,680
Here.

1154
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,880
Go! Go!

1155
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,160
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1156
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,040
Fall!

1157
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,120
Is that it?

1158
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,320
Do it again.

1159
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,000
Double or nothing?

1160
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,640
What else?

1161
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,120
All right.

1162
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,640
That is bullshit. I never did that!

1163
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,880
That is luck, man!

1164
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,680
Uh, I`m really sorry.

1165
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,560
There`s nothing I can do.
The nine ball fell.

1166
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,440
I can`t believe that.

1167
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,360
You a hustler, Amos?

1168
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,960
Come on, Eddie, man.
Luck.

1169
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,600
Are you a hustler?

1170
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,680
Hey, you don`t
want to pay me?

1171
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,920
Keep it. Forget it.

1172
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,280
I don`t want
no bad feelings.

1173
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,720
I mean, a guy loses--

1174
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,720
I lost, I paid. I don`t--

1175
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,920
- Oh, well
- Are you a hustler, Amos?

1176
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,840
What?
You want to quit?

1177
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,000
Fuck you, kid.

1178
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,080
- Double it again.
- Somebody help me, oh

1179
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,280
With these blues

1180
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,440
Well, now, she's the one I'm loving

1181
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,720
I do hate to lose

1182
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,040
I do hate to lose

1183
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,360
I do hate to lose

1184
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,880
Oh, Lord

1185
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,480
Sure enough I do

1186
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,400
Oh, well

1187
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,280
- Hey, I want to ask you something.
- I been crazy

1188
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,080
I want you to be
real honest with me.

1189
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,240
Yes, I been a fool

1190
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,400
- You think I need to lose some weight?
- I been crazy, oh

1191
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,600
All of my life

1192
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,280
Well, I done fell in love

1193
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,280
With another man's wife

1194
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,240
With another man's wife

1195
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,800
How could I get...

1196
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,160
suckered like that?

1197
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,520
You gotta work hard.
I mean, that takes a real gift to...

1198
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,920
show your ass like that.

1199
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,680
Everything kinda stacked.

1200
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,680
Everything--Just probably
a little too much booze...

1201
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,040
a little too cocky...

1202
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,160
right amount of jerk...

1203
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,080
to miss all those fuckin` signals.

1204
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,200
Hey.

1205
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,640
Eddie, you`ll get him next time, huh?

1206
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,760
How much would you need
to go it on your own...

1207
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,240
from here to Atlantic City?

1208
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,000
What?

1209
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,360
Should have wiped
the floor with that guy.

1210
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,680
Yeah? So?

1211
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,000
How much would you need to go
from here to Atlantic City?

1212
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,600
A couple thousand?

1213
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,960
Come on, Eddie.
You had a little too much to drink.

1214
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,560
- Let`s go back to the motel, forget about it.
- Hey.

1215
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,040
I got nothing left to teach you, kid.
That was the last lesson in here.

1216
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,080
Come on. Take the money.

1217
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,000
Front for yourself.
You`ll do fine.

1218
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,000
What are you talking, man.
You`re walking off?

1219
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,920
- Dumping us.
- Dumping you? I`m giving you a stake.

1220
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,720
I showed you all I got.
I showed you my ass in here.

1221
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,040
Now, what the hell else
do you want? That`s it! That`s all!

1222
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,960
Well, what are we
supposed to do? I mean...

1223
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,640
where we supposed
to go from here?

1224
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,240
Well, here is you, see?
Here is Atlantic City.

1225
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,240
In between is about 27 pool halls.
Three weeks, a couple thousand dollars.

1226
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,800
- What the hell else do you need?
An Indian guide? Use your brains!
- Why you talking to us this way, huh?

1227
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,360
I mean, some guy comes in here and plays
you for a chump, so you walk out on us?

1228
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,880
I mean, come on!
We`ll get this guy next time, Eddie.

1229
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,080
Hey, hey!

1230
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,760
Eddie. Eddie, you do this to some guy
on the street. You don`t do this to me.

1231
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,680
What about all the stuff you told me? You
know, what we talked about, me and you.

1232
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,160
- Huh? Now you`re gonna ruin everything.
- Get out of here.

1233
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,600
Carmen and me, huh?
Well, you told me about that.

1234
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,400
Okay, look, Eddie.
Hey, it`s my attitude, right?

1235
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,040
- Okay. From now on--
- Attitude, bullshit.
- Eddie, I swear to you. No, no, no. Swear--

1236
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,280
Kiddo, you always do
what you want to do!

1237
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,240
- Don`t tell me that!
- If I tell you to do this, you do that.
- Don`t tell me that! I try to do everything--

1238
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,000
- I`m tired!
- I try to do everything that you tell me to do!

1239
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,880
You don`t need me anymore.
Take the money, huh?

1240
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:54,120
- It`s the last thing I got left to give you.
- Let it go, Vincent.

1241
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,600
- You wanna give me money to get rid of me.
- You`re young, kid. You got a long way to go.

1242
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,280
You want to give me money, give me money,
`cause this is nickel-and-dime shit
you been giving me.

1243
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,360
- I`ll give you money, but don`t you
tell me what I`m about.
- Shut up and give me money.

1244
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,640
- Make it 3,000. It`s our money.
- I`ll give you what I got!
- Yeah, that`s right.
It`s our fuckin` money anyway!

1245
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,200
I`ll give you what I got!

1246
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,320
You know something?
Just keep your fuckin` money, pal.

1247
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,280
Here.

1248
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,240
Fuck it!

1249
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,240
Fuck!

1250
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,320
Yeah, well--

1251
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,360
Feel good, don`t it?

1252
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,720
- Oh, I`m blind.
- Aw, you`re cool.

1253
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,960
The same? Worse?

1254
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,200
Better.

1255
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,680
Better?
Same? Worse?

1256
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,800
Better.

1257
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,560
Better?
Same? Worse?

1258
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,760
- I like the glasses.
- Yeah?

1259
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,840
Fast Eddie, this here`s Moselle.
He plays pool.

1260
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,120
No kidding.

1261
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,080
- That`s a nice stick.
- I get the break.

1262
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,440
- What`s the book?
- Fifty on Fast Eddie wins you a hundred.

1263
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,040
- Fifty on Moselle wins you 25.
- Well, thanks.

1264
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,960
Facts of life, my man.

1265
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,960
- Hundred on the side?
- Read my mind.

1266
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,080
Rack `em up.

1267
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,680
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie--
- Moselle.

1268
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,800
Moselle, Moselle. Thank you.

1269
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,840
You guys going
to Atlantic City?

1270
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,560
That`s $4.00.
You need at least five.

1271
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,880
Resorts International
Hotel And Casino...

1272
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,080
on the Boardwalk
in Atlantic City...

1273
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,480
welcomes you
to our casino.

1274
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,840
As anyone can tell you,
the greatest single secret to success...

1275
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,560
on the casino floor is knowing
how to play the game.

1276
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:22,200
There are slot machines,
roulette, blackjack, craps...

1277
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,720
deep-six
and baccarat tables.

1278
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,200
Some have simple,
easy-to-learn rules...

1279
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,600
but most are
more complicated--

1280
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,200
The rules, regulations
and pay-out odds...

1281
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,040
are established
and supervised...

1282
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,640
by the NewJersey
Casino Control Commission.

1283
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,080
Knock `em dead.

1284
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,920
Gonna try.

1285
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,920
Hey!

1286
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:56,080
Keep saying now
Daddy, I have to leave you

1287
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,960
Oh,yeah

1288
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:02,840
But I'm in love
with another guy

1289
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,480
Oh, no, no

1290
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,800
I couldn't believe

1291
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,360
- Hey, Eddie.
- Couldn't believe

1292
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,320
What?

1293
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,960
You playing?

1294
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,440
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
- I don`t got any problem with that.
You got any problem with that?

1295
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,200
- I got no problem.
- If it makes you happy, do it.

1296
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,960
I just wanted to say hello.

1297
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,240
The tears came down like rain

1298
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,480
Hello, test, test.
One, two, three.

1299
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,480
One, test.

1300
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's nice to see so many faces here...

1301
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,400
for today's nine-ball classic.

1302
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,000
Players, start your matches.

1303
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,840
I didn`t deserve that.

1304
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,200
Is this your first
tournament, Duke?

1305
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,440
Match to Mr. Felson...

1306
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,120
eleven games to five.

1307
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,520
I didn`t deserve that.

1308
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,760
Yes, you did.

1309
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:50,160
Tall and tan
and young and handsome

1310
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,840
The boy from Ipanema
goes walking

1311
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:58,920
And when he passes
each girl he passes goes

1312
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,000
We`ll play 10 games. You only have
to win eight. I got to win 10.

1313
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:08,360
And I`ll put up $1,200,
and you only have to put up $800.

1314
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,440
- Okay, wait a minute.
I only have to win eight games to your 10?
- That`s right.

1315
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,160
- And you`re gonna put up 1,200 to my $800?
- That`s right.

1316
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,800
- Carmen, that sounds like a good deal.
I mean, this is a good deal, isn`t it?
- It is a good deal.

1317
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,520
This guy won the Akron Open, Vincent.
Don`t be a jerk.

1318
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,560
There is no such thing as the Akron Open.
Where did you hear that?

1319
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,520
Oh, no?
What have I been reading about?

1320
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,480
Hey, Carmen. I can win eight games here.
Now, don`t blow this. Let me play this guy.

1321
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,000
No, I know you can-- I`m not gonna blow it.
I just don`t like the deal.

1322
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,320
- What don`t you like about it, lady?
- I think maybe you should
up your end to about 1,500.
- Up my end?

1323
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,960
- Hey. Hey.
- That`s right. $300, Vincent, is not
gonna kill the guy! Fifteen hundred.

1324
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,840
All right. All right. I`ll tell you what.
I shouldn`t, but I will. $1,500.
How`s that? Is that a deal?

1325
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,880
Okay. Yeah.
Hey, I`m sorry about--

1326
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,400
Don`t be sorry.

1327
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,760
All right, it`s 8:30.
I got a few things to do.

1328
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,760
- How about 12:30 in the green room?
- 12:30. Great.

1329
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,560
Terrific.

1330
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,920
- You can get these, right?
- No problem.

1331
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,920
We got it covered here.

1332
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,160
- $1,500?
- Not bad, huh?

1333
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,880
''Not bad, huh``?

1334
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,720
- He wouldn`t go for more, Vincent.
- You wouldn`t go for more. That guy had
$2,000 written all over his face.

1335
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,440
You just gave him $500.
You`re gonna buy his drink too? Huh?

1336
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,080
- Thank you.
- Why don`t you do it yourself next time.
- Hey.

1337
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,000
- I got to go rest.
- Great.

1338
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,000
Hey.

1339
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,040
You got new glasses, huh?
They look good.

1340
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:39,440
- Well, it`s Vincent the kid and Carmen.
- Hey, Eddie. You look real good today.

1341
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,160
- So how`s it going?
- Can`t complain. How about you?

1342
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:46,520
Uh, $4,000 in three weeks. I guess it could
have been better, could have been worse.

1343
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,560
Well, I`m happy for you.

1344
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,720
At 12:30 in the green room, we`re gonna
take out that lame from Akron.
Did you see what we did to that guy?

1345
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,440
You want in on it?

1346
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,720
Well, thanks. Uh--

1347
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,960
Listen, I-- I`ll pass up on that. I got to
play at 10:00, and I just pack it in early.

1348
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,920
All right.
It`s on you.

1349
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,680
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Same to you.
- Thank you.

1350
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,920
Uh, I got to go rest.

1351
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,440
Uh, come and get me
in about three hours, okay?

1352
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,760
- In three?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1353
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,400
Going good?

1354
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:23,920
Yeah. Yeah.
We`re doing okay.

1355
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,240
You were right, you know.
We-- We really didn`t need you anymore.

1356
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,840
That`s what I said.

1357
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,960
You wouldn`t believe Vincent now.
I mean, you-you wouldn`t even recognize him.

1358
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,880
Oh, he`s a new man, huh?

1359
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:38,800
- Why don`t you take him up on tonight?
- Well, like I said, I got to get up
early and play, so--

1360
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,160
Well, see you around.

1361
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:50,000
He's tall and tan
And young and handsome

1362
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,520
The boy from Ipanema
goes walking

1363
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:57,400
And when he passes I smile

1364
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,480
It`s like a nightmare, isn`t it?

1365
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,360
You got lucky,
you lucky prick.

1366
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,960
Wipe your nose, will you,Julian?

1367
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,960
You`re going down, Eddie.

1368
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,400
Oh, goddamn.

1369
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,040
Jesus Christ.

1370
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,960
Yeah, and it just keeps getting worse
and worse, doesn`t it?

1371
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,400
Take it on off.
I can`t help it.

1372
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,000
Eddie.

1373
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,680
- Nice game, Eddie.
- Thank you.

1374
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:40,360
- Dynamite game, Eddie.
- Good game.

1375
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,880
- Excuse me.
- Way to go.
- Good game.

1376
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,880
I`m doing fine.

1377
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,840
Yeah, I`m really feeling nervous
`cause I feel good.

1378
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:58,480
Yeah. Eyes feel good,
legs feel great.

1379
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,520
I get no grief down here. Come on
down here and give me some grief.

1380
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,280
Forget the Bahamas.
This is it.

1381
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,000
Hey.

1382
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,800
It would be good
having you here.

1383
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,320
Hey.

1384
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,040
I`m gonna beat him, you know.

1385
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,800
Well...

1386
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,040
maybe.

1387
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,800
Hello, Eddie.

1388
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,800
It`s nice.

1389
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,680
Ron Albrecht
and Larry Schwartz.

1390
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,880
Following match
on table number eight...

1391
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:51,280
Vincent Lauria
and Eddie Felson.

1392
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,920
Hey, you shot a great game.

1393
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,640
Well, the balls roll funny for everybody. I told
you that. I mean, you shot a great game.

1394
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,880
Good job.

1395
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,840
Nice game, Eddie.

1396
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,800
- Oh, come on.
- Eddie!

1397
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:01,760
- Who is it?
- Vincent!

1398
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:07,960
Oh, I can`t believe it.

1399
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,960
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, I`m sorry. Should we come back later?

1400
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:15,920
No, no. No.
We were just, uh--

1401
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,720
Janelle`s having a glass of cham--
early bubbly. Come on in.

1402
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:24,160
Listen, I--
I drew this guy Kennedy...

1403
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,800
uh, in the semifinals.

1404
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,040
You know anything
about him?

1405
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:32,800
- What`s that?
- That`s for you.

1406
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,200
- Hey, how you doing? That`s your cut.
- Cut of what?

1407
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,040
- For the game.
- What game?

1408
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:42,640
Our game, man. I dumped. Got a front to
lay all 4,000 on you, and then I dumped.

1409
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,280
Alls I had to do was dog
about four shots, you know?

1410
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,680
But, Eddie, you know something,
you are a very, very good player.

1411
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:51,880
I feel shitty about getting booted,
but there`s other tournaments, right?

1412
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:55,440
Right.
You dumped, huh?

1413
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,880
Carmen didn`t want to go for it, but I told her,
hey, you`d appreciate it. I mean, of all people.

1414
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,320
There`s $8,000 in there.

1415
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,440
After I beat Grady Seasons, the odds
between me and him were a joke.

1416
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,520
Two brothers and a stranger, Eddie,
just like you laid it out.
You know, it was beautiful.

1417
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,280
It was beautiful. It was just--
It was-- It was fuckin` beautiful.

1418
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:14,440
When I banked the five--
Hey, when I saw the lay of the table,
I knew that it was gonna be the five.

1419
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:19,760
That`s the art of the dump, right-- to be able
to just--just miss the pocket by a hair.

1420
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,480
I mean, the audience--''Oh!``
It was--

1421
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,600
It was-- I--

1422
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,160
$8,000 in there.

1423
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,720
Hey, we got to split.
Look...

1424
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,040
I got green room games
for the next three nights.

1425
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:38,080
These guys, they just won`t leave me alone.
Are you sure you don`t want in on this?
We`re talking about a lot of money.

1426
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,520
Yeah. Maybe.

1427
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,160
Okay.

1428
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,200
I`ll call you, okay?

1429
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:47,240
Look, good luck
with Kennedy, all right?

1430
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:53,280
He`s a little prick.

1431
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,240
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's good to see you all here today...

1432
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:02,360
for the semifinals
of today's nine-ball classic.

1433
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:04,840
Right now on table one will be...

1434
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,200
competing from Chicago,
Larry Schwartz.

1435
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:11,040
Larry will be playing,
out of St. Louis, Missouri...

1436
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:15,600
the the incomparable St. Louis Louis,
Louis Robbins.

1437
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:27,040
...regional nine-ball champion
Lorenzo Kennedy...

1438
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,600
will be playing,
as we welcome back...

1439
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,960
Fast Eddie Felson.

1440
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:38,400
Players, begin your matches.

1441
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,040
What are you doing?

1442
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,840
- I forfeit.
- Forfeit.

1443
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:25,240
- Forfeit?
- Felson just forfeited his match.
- What do you mean, forfeit?

1444
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,840
You can`t forfeit.

1445
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:29,720
- What`s he talking about?
What kind of bullshit is this?
- Well, he just threw 50,000 away.

1446
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,600
Come on, Eddie. Don`t forfeit.
I don`t want to win like this.

1447
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:38,120
Yeah, but I didn`t want
to win like that, though.

1448
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:01,520
The match on table three
has been forfeited by Eddie Felson.

1449
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,120
Lorenzo Kennedy,
win by default.

1450
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,520
So what do you say? Why don`t we
get the hell out of here?

1451
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,360
The Bahamas are looking
real good to me about now.

1452
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,800
Anyway, I got out of my lease.

1453
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,000
All my stuff` s in boxes.

1454
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,960
That`s nice.

1455
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I`m a real big fan
of character in people.

1456
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,240
I don`t know
if you knew that about me.

1457
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,920
- Character, huh?
- Yeah.

1458
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,480
Here it comes.

1459
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:04,080
Vincent says this is yours. You don`t
want it, you should give it to charity.

1460
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,800
- What`ll that solve?
- I don`t know.

1461
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,920
I don`t know anything anymore.

1462
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,800
I want his best game.

1463
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:13,560
Look, if you want his best game, Eddie,
go talk to him yourself.

1464
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,960
- He won`t listen to me.
- So, what, I got to cover your ass now?

1465
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:20,520
No. You got to save it.

1466
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,120
Well, why should I?

1467
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,760
I`ll be in the green room.

1468
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,520
- Stings like a bitch, don`t it?
- Yes, it does.

1469
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:04,760
You got brass, man.
I`ll give you that.

1470
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:08,120
You want my game? You couldn`t deal
with my game,jack. You`re outmanned.

1471
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,800
Let`s find out. I`m asking you.

1472
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:14,040
- I ain`t got a leg to stand on,
but I`m asking you.
- Shove it!

1473
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:17,560
- Don`t do that, kid.
- I call the shots. I do what I want to do.

1474
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:20,600
Don`t do it. I don`t have
that many games left in me.

1475
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,960
God! You used us!
You used me!

1476
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:25,520
Yes, I did...

1477
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:28,600
but you`re in Atlantic City now
with the big boys.

1478
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:32,040
You`re not back there in the stockroom
playing around with baby dolls.

1479
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:36,160
Think about it.
It`s a wash.

1480
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,920
About all that other stuff,
I don`t take much pride in that.

1481
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,680
It`s even, but it ain`t settled.
Let`s settle it.

1482
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,400
Why should I?

1483
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:49,200
How long do you want me to fry, huh?
Five years? Ten years?

1484
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,920
You want to play kick the dog
for the rest of your life?

1485
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,120
Come on.
Let`s clean it up.

1486
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,160
Listen to this. What, you want to play
for the envelope? Is that it?

1487
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:16,560
Whatever.

1488
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,560
Thank you.

1489
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,760
Eddie, what are you gonna do
when I kick your ass?

1490
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,600
Pick myself up
and let you kick me again.

1491
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,000
Oh, yeah?

1492
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,600
Yeah.

1493
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,800
Just don`t put the money
in the bank, kid.

1494
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,920
`Cause If I don`t whip you now,
I`m gonna whip you next month in Dallas.

1495
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,720
You mean Houston.
There`s nothing coming up in Dallas.

1496
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:00,960
Houston, Dallas. And if not then,
then the month after that in New Orleans.

1497
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,160
Oh, yeah?
What makes you so sure?

1498
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:11,400
Hey, I`m back.

1499
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:25,360
I feel so doggone lonely

1500
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:32,200
Todayjust isn't my day

1501
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,560
When I got home this mornin'

1502
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:45,480
I found a letter on my bed

1503
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:52,120
When I opened up that letter

1504
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:58,920
I broke right down and cried

1505
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,680
She said, now, daddy
I hate to leave you

1506
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,440
Oh,yeah

1507
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:12,440
But I'm in love
with another guy

1508
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:16,680
Oh, no, no
I couldn't believe

1509
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,680
I couldn't believe she wrote it

1510
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:27,000
So I read her letter again

1511
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,840
And when I was finished

1512
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,320
The tears came down like rain

1513
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,640
The more I read this doggone letter

1514
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:54,120
The more my poor heart cries

1515
01:53:56,040 --> 01:54:00,000
She said, now, daddy
I hate to leave you

1516
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,080
Oh,yeah

1517
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:07,800
But I'm in love with another guy

1518
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:10,320
My baby, she said

1519
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:14,400
Oh,yeah
My baby, she said

1520
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,120
My baby, she said

1521
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,520
My baby, she said

1522
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,440
This what she said

1523
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,360
She said, now, daddy
I hate to leave you

1524
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,160
Oh,yeah

1525
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:33,960
But I'm in love
with another guy
