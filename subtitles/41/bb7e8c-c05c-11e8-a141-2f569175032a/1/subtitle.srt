1
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,216
Hello?

2
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,819
Hey babes, are you up?

3
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,727
You little sleeping beauty you...

4
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,825
Wake up or else I'll come bite ya!

5
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,937
That was a morning call service
for Ms NA Nan

6
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,322
Ever since I started getting salary
instead of allowance, I simply

7
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,527
Forgot how a good morning felt like
KIM Joo-hyuk

8
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:51,433
Every morning, I was confronted
with problems I needed to solve

9
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,747
Should I go take a big one, or no?

10
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,112
Should I wash my hair, or no?

11
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,517
Everything had to start with
a swift decision making

12
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:38,723
Singles

13
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,522
Hey

14
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,922
Didn't I tell you
not to call in the morning

15
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,932
Unless there's a big sale?

16
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,526
Your voice is no good
for a morning call

17
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,334
Hey, I have a hole on my head

18
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,144
Must be Alopecia

19
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,036
You stressed over work too much

20
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,810
What if I turn bald?

21
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,512
Don't worry it'll grow back in no time

22
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,317
- Hey!
- Hey!

23
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,721
What?
What the hell are you doing?

24
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,020
Close the door!

25
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,221
- Jesus!
- You scared the hell out of me!

26
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,533
- You said you were coming home late
- The appointment got cancelled

27
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,932
You could've called

28
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,835
What? I'm supposed to get
permission to come home?

29
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,737
Here we go again.
Aren't you guys sick of fighting?

30
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,538
Come out! I need to go

31
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm not even half way there yet

32
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,313
Then cut it short

33
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,315
Okay, I'll hang up

34
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,511
Sorry, Nan... hello?

35
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,436
Too salty

36
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,636
Any soup?

37
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,644
This is way too salty

38
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,786
Roommate

39
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,117
Roommate, 46th boyfriend

40
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:33,536
- Move out!
- Whatever

41
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,939
Wait!

42
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,542
Excuse me

43
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,513
We still have leverage

44
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,818
If we alter the designs

45
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,019
according to changing
customer preference and

46
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,221
carry out a more aggressive
marketing scheme

47
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,525
we still have a chance

48
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,635
- Hey, Chun!
- Yes?

49
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,138
If that's how you're going to play
just forget about it

50
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,134
It was too early

51
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:15,236
Didn't I tell you that
it was too early, moron!

52
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,905
You're right on

53
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,119
That's precisely why I said

54
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,517
we needed a more
cautious strategy

55
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,022
that's suits 1492's image better
but then...

56
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,525
That's what I said, asshole

57
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,424
What happened there?

58
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:35,425
It has to be here somewhere

59
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,129
- Asshole
- Isn't he, isn't he?

60
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,739
Forget it

61
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,442
Hey, Chun... try harder, okay?

62
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,320
What should I wear
for the presentation?

63
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,324
I think
I'll just go on a shopping spree

64
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,124
Focus on the action plan
rather than your outfit

65
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,728
Espresso, right?

66
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,536
LEE Dong-mi!

67
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,842
Yes?

68
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,108
Hope things are going well

69
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,419
I have faith in you.
You know my taste, right?

70
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,116
- Did you hear about MAH?
- What about him?

71
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,231
He had a thing with LEE Yoo-jung
from human resources, you know

72
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,432
- Now, LEE Yoo-jung too?
- Yeah

73
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,230
What's wrong with people?

74
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,737
- That's so pathetic
- Totally

75
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,555
- Sorry... I'm kind of late, huh?
- That's okay

76
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,456
It's still not easy getting out
on time after all these years

77
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,759
They're now telling me to
get married to my face

78
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,968
You don't look too good

79
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,574
- You don't eat well, do you?
- I'm fine

80
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,941
Ta-da!

81
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,743
Let's drink this later in the room

82
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,451
Isn't it pretty?

83
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,452
It smells good too.
Smell it

84
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,466
- Nan...
- Don't you like it?

85
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,263
Nan... it's not easy, is it?

86
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,274
It's okay, really...

87
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,940
It's hard for me too

88
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,750
What?

89
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,149
Let's end it

90
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,063
You didn't order yet, did you?

91
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,166
Aren't you going to take order?

92
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,062
How's the project going?

93
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,070
- And what about the thesis?
- We're finished

94
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,966
I don't know

95
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,769
About our relationship

96
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:48,559
I let him go nice and clean

97
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,558
It always rains in movies
right about now

98
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,586
Let's eat

99
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,261
I guess she's really not coming

100
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,272
Would you if you had a suite?

101
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,869
I bet they did it already

102
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,072
Shower, you idiot

103
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,241
Here!

104
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,352
Guess significant others are
more important than friends alright

105
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:53,447
Of course, You can't have sex
with friends

106
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,861
Is that all you can...

107
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,463
talk about?

108
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,659
Every male and female problem
starts with sex and ends with sex

109
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,168
You make it sound like
you're pretty good at it

110
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,169
You don't know me

111
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,575
I don't wanna know

112
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,470
People with big mouths
are actually poor in bed

113
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,979
I really am good in talking and...

114
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,640
- You know
- That's what you think

115
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,754
- Hey, babes... should I teach you a lesson?
- Get off of me

116
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,559
Would you like to feel it?

117
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,363
Get your fat leg off of me, lady

118
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,265
I won't hit you

119
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,771
You can be honest with me tonight

120
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,068
Do you wanna move out?

121
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,768
Hey!

122
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,776
I was going to let this go

123
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,972
But you got me going

124
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,449
- Come on, really! Really!
- Hey, stop! Stop!

125
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,350
Hey, Nan!

126
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,665
He let me go, because he loves me.
Because he loves me

127
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:16,967
Fuckin' asshole!
He should've let me go before then

128
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,646
What am I, a joke?

129
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,344
I'll break him

130
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,756
I'll rip him apart

131
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,160
And have him dry to death

132
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,958
My heart's breaking

133
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,168
Hey

134
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:54,075
I'm feeling filthy, Dong-mi
let's go hit the spa

135
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,249
I think that it will definitely help
boost sales

136
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,548
My reputation's on the line here

137
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,750
So I'm sure you'll take care of it.
I have faith in you

138
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,054
Don't worry, Mr Chun

139
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,756
This is the new branding strategy

140
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,057
Forget that

141
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,169
Just hand over all the prep work
to Hae-jin here

142
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,063
I'm sorry?

143
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:27,774
Hae-jin will be going to
the New York Collection this year

144
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,742
But wait... already booked the flight
and made a hotel reservation

145
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,455
Okay, well... in that case
kindly go ahead and

146
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,951
Cancel them

147
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:48,360
Oh... my...
What are you gonna do?

148
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:53,869
Nan!

149
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,373
This kind of unfair relocation
is not acceptable

150
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,568
Why don't you just fire me?

151
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,770
If you want me to quit
I'll do that for you

152
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,380
I don't want to work for a company

153
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,143
that gets dictated
by someone like Chun

154
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,343
who shamelessly steals ideas
and avoids responsibilities

155
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,953
I will show you what's up

156
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,249
through a lawsuit if necessary

157
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,654
Just wait and see!

158
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,558
What is it?

159
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,864
Sit!

160
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,447
Thank you, sir

161
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,048
I always thought of you
as a father figure

162
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,057
Thank you

163
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,059
Thank you

164
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:09,975
Come on, let's meet up.
I miss you

165
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,948
Let's meet up and talk, baby

166
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,144
Not tonight

167
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,347
I'll be finished early today

168
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,357
Let's meet up, okay?

169
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:26,157
I'll wait for you

170
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,756
I have books and CDs.
I'll wait for you listening to music

171
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,360
I'm okay, baby.
Come on... I wanna see you

172
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,870
I said I'm okay!

173
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,671
What's your problem!
I said I'm okay!

174
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,576
Do you have other plans or something?

175
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,548
Are you seeing another girl?

176
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,244
What the... is she crazy?
What is wrong with her?

177
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,647
Hey, what's wrong with her?

178
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,655
I have books and CDs

179
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,454
I'll wait for you
listening to music, okay?

180
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,560
I might die
before I turn thirty out of anger

181
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,168
I feel like dieing

182
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,271
Don't you think that's enough?

183
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,573
Call me when you get this message

184
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,444
You're killing me here

185
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,247
If you're going to kill yourself
call me

186
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,253
So that I can go clean up
your corpse

187
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,178
What a bunch of assholes...

188
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,248
The oldest trick
in the damn fucking book!

189
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,944
What do they expect you to do
at a restaurant?

190
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,653
Just quit.
You do what you need to...

191
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,453
but you're not going to look too good
when you can't pay your bills

192
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,756
Let's face it... they get over a thousand
applicants just for a borough position

193
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,660
And they're all Masters
and Doctors

194
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,565
Is that how you
sympathize with people?

195
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,170
I'm just talking reality here

196
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,566
In any case

197
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,573
Nan needs a grand each month

198
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,472
- She has to pay off her loans
- Fuck

199
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,578
- pay for utilities, and...
- Fuck

200
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,648
- credit card bills
- Fuck

201
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,044
There's only one conclusion

202
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,153
Just show up to where
you were re-Iocated

203
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,258
And we'll figure out...

204
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,359
The rest later

205
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,962
Fuck!

206
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,667
Hey, Nan... what is it
that you really want to do?

207
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,171
What I want?

208
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,004
I used to have dreams

209
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,379
I wanted to become a manager
when I was 27

210
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,885
When I was 23

211
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,788
I wanted to become
a world renowned designer

212
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,393
- That's my really dream
- When I was 20

213
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,988
All I wanted was becoming
a career woman

214
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,693
When I was 19

215
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,099
Getting into College
meant everything

216
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,505
We all just wanted to move out
back then

217
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,908
Well... we achieved
that dream alright

218
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,876
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

219
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,792
You can still see stars

220
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,985
You're right!

221
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:50,496
No the stars have fallen

222
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:57,102
just as my heart has broken

223
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,507
Dong-mi, we have to pay for
utilities tomorrow

224
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,779
- You little...
- When I get my hands on you...

225
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,079
Excuse me!

226
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,185
Yes!

227
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,002
Welcome to Chili's!

228
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,084
I'm quitting after pay day

229
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,992
I'm telling you... it's manual labor

230
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,590
Stop bitching about it

231
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,497
And go right ahead

232
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:02,005
- You're sleeping already?
- What time is it?

233
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,508
It's late Go to sleep, okay?
Get some rest

234
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,103
Bitch!

235
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,582
Is everything okay?
What's going on?

236
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,694
Don't worry.
It's no fire

237
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,193
Everything's okay?

238
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,994
You should've called if you were
going to pop a smoke shell

239
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,901
I am so sorry

240
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,101
911 is no joke, lady

241
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,502
I'm sorry

242
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,511
Roaches these days

243
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,082
- Survive smoke shells
- You're right

244
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,086
I'll do it, I'll do it

245
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,488
I'm sorry I totally forgot

246
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,794
- I'm sorry
- Not easy, huh?

247
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,804
I'm sorry

248
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,901
I'm going nuts

249
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,074
The Nashville project
will help us

250
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,779
respond flexibly
to fast-changing

251
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,185
web market trends
at the same time

252
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,885
gives us a local market
understanding

253
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,689
Next is a an action plan prepared
by Ms Kim Hyun-jung

254
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,195
- which will...
- Oh

255
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,897
That's enough for now

256
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,297
Let's talk about event planning

257
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,098
Will you turn on the lights?

258
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,900
Why don't you sit too, Dong-mi?

259
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,203
VPs of Europe and Asia regions

260
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,313
will be attending the conference

261
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,678
meaning that we'll really have
to focus on the details

262
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,475
KIM, kindly prepare a simulation
model and showcase the demo

263
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,987
And SHIM, define the roles
of the participants

264
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,784
- for the second event
- Okay

265
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,083
And LEE!

266
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,789
Yes, sir!

267
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,590
Prepare with Hyun-jung

268
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,995
Party food and beverage

269
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,600
Selecting the menu won't be easy

270
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,293
As Europeans
have picky tastes

271
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:16,297
Sir, then who's doing
the Nashville presentation?

272
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,502
What do you mean?
That's my job, isn't it?

273
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:25,776
Hyun-jung and I have worked
day and night

274
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,385
on this project

275
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,384
Why should we

276
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,388
be handling party prep?

277
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,082
LEE Dong-mi!

278
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,888
I think you're deeply mistaken

279
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,894
Who said female assistants

280
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,693
could give presentations
to directors?

281
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,892
The conference starts next week

282
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,596
We're going to camp
out in the office

283
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,579
LEE Dong-mi

284
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,180
Can I see you for a sec?

285
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,691
LEE Dong-mi

286
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,796
What's with you?

287
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,300
Are you gonna quit after this
or something?

288
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,305
You know damn well how things

289
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,910
are run around here

290
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,314
Have a seat

291
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,488
I really like

292
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,089
the Nashville project

293
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,089
You totally read my taste

294
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,293
I think we can be great partners

295
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,199
You just need to follow my lead

296
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,010
Just need to follow your lead, huh?

297
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,478
Do you wanna go for
a few drinks tonight?

298
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,785
I have special plans for you

299
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,987
I have plans too, you know

300
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,298
Impatient type, huh?

301
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,005
- Wait
- Why?

302
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,401
I don't know about here...

303
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,503
Let's go to my room

304
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,007
Shall we?

305
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,673
- You said your room
- Well, I mean... um...

306
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,285
- Wow!
- Oh my god!

307
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,583
This is the special plan
for you, fucker

308
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,486
You fucking shit

309
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,790
Out of my way!

310
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,498
Look at your underwear taste

311
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,595
That was Dong-mi's
last corporate action

312
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:34,404
Hey, Na! That's you, right?

313
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,908
Good to see you

314
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,203
You look good

315
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,609
Your legs look well trained

316
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,975
So...

317
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,875
What brings you here?

318
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,589
Came here to report
the receipts, huh?

319
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,491
Okay, okay

320
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,785
I'll stop by soon
to help boost sales

321
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,986
Just been a little too busy

322
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,496
I'll stop by soon with the kids

323
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,997
Keep up the good work

324
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,187
9th, right?

325
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,303
What a shame, huh?

326
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,601
What?

327
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,382
This elevator, it's too slow

328
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,387
PARK Soo-heon speaking

329
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:01,781
Hold on, wait

330
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,388
One sec

331
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,108
Yes... 783...

332
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:41,290
I find it strange that a person

333
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,695
could hate someone so much

334
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:46,497
You're bound to meet
someone like that

335
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,606
I'm way too rational

336
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,208
- Miss!
- Yes!

337
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,908
Look at you...

338
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,583
I really need to quit

339
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,185
Just go

340
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,288
What, are you starving yourself?

341
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,391
Thought you were on a diet?

342
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,697
When you're jobless, you just need
to treat yourself whenever you can

343
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,893
It's different from going on a diet

344
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,901
It's about survival

345
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,502
Hey, Tae-wook's getting married
at the end of this month

346
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,203
Oh yeah? And?

347
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,377
Think about who'll come

348
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,683
LEE Jee-hoon?

349
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,090
Should I go there or no?

350
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,589
Stop eating
Don't even drink water

351
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,994
You can't afford to gain weight

352
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,693
And we'll go get massages, okay?

353
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,799
What's with you suddenly?

354
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,998
You need to go there and
make him regret dumping you

355
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,206
Look at you! You look awful

356
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,813
Really?

357
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:08,180
- Are those freckles there?
- Where? What?

358
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,983
You're vitamin deficient.
Here get loaded up

359
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,786
Have some greens
and vegetables too

360
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,492
Eat

361
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,794
Hey, there's Joon

362
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,492
Joon, here!

363
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,103
- Is that Ji-hae?
- Guess so

364
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,397
I heard so much about you two

365
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,102
You're prettier in real life...
both of you

366
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,776
Joon said so many nice things
about you

367
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,180
I was dieing to meet you

368
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,876
I heard that you guys
are like butt buddies

369
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,090
That actually looks real

370
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,193
It is real

371
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,894
That's what I thought too

372
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,601
How do you know?

373
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,802
Look, the zipper blade
is too dense

374
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,111
I bet the logo will come off too

375
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,181
Let's see

376
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:27,091
You didn't have to lie to me

377
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,299
That came off real easy

378
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,404
Welcome to Chili's

379
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,274
- How big is your party?
- What?

380
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,076
Did you make a reservation?

381
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,784
No

382
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,583
- You know me, right?
- Excuse me?

383
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,897
Oh yeah...

384
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,701
Guide him to his table

385
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,203
I'll guide you to your table, sir

386
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,876
- Did you ask for me, sir?
- Yeah...

387
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,585
The beer taste is a little...

388
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,289
That can't be

389
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,999
How is it?

390
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,099
Tastes fine to me

391
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,702
No way

392
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,086
What's wrong with it?

393
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,889
You sure
you didn't feel anything strange?

394
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:06,593
That's weird... thought my lips touched

395
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,996
Sir, is this a joke?

396
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,206
Bingo! Now I remember him

397
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,302
Look at his creepy smile.
The guy from the elevator!

398
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,979
But why is he here?
Maybe he has feelings for...

399
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,381
Welcome to Chili's!

400
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,284
It's my college alumni get-together

401
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,586
Guys! Come on in

402
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,593
It's him again

403
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:44,593
Still creepy.
Looks awfully boring

404
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,300
Here's your card

405
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:52,205
Why don't you show me, your real intent, Mr!
Say it! Just say it!

406
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,811
- Have a good night
- Good night

407
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,884
Welcome to Chili's!

408
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,883
It's my high school alumni
get-together

409
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,489
Hello?

410
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:13,095
Oh yeah? Toad's coming too?

411
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:18,794
- How's he doing?
- He's definitely a player

412
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,697
Good taste though

413
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,801
He's here again

414
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,613
Come in

415
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,678
- Welcome to Chili's
- Come on, come on

416
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,087
So today's your junior high alumni
get-together, huh?

417
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:41,089
No, it's my kindergarten alumni
get-together

418
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,693
Hey Toad, let's go!

419
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,402
Welcome to Chili's

420
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,399
- Nan!
- Hi, Nan

421
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,499
Long time no see.
I came here to help boost sales

422
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,408
It's packed here

423
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:04,378
It was good today

424
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,779
What was it
at the end of the presentation?

425
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,482
Thank you for the...

426
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,885
Look at this uniform

427
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,685
You can be a model

428
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,886
I knew you would do well
but not this well

429
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,997
It's all because you're healthy

430
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,197
Sorry for being healthy

431
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,097
I knew from the beginning

432
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,000
That you would fit in better on-scene.
You look great

433
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,108
Am I right or what, Young-sook?

434
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,210
Have a good time

435
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,811
Oh yeah... one more thing

436
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,078
- Yes
- Keep up the good work

437
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,093
- Are you alright?
- Are you alright, sir?

438
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,203
I'm not filling out no forms

439
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,310
You should send this fucker to jail

440
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:10,471
Please calm down.
Let's take this one by one

441
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,381
How many times do I have to tell you?

442
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,585
I got punched while I was talking

443
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,485
Right? Right?

444
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,190
Can't I even talk?

445
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,693
What ever happened to freedom
of speech?

446
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,196
Didn't you touch
this lady's butt over here?

447
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,197
Jesus...

448
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:34,202
I did it to cheer her up...
as a mentor

449
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,498
Yes I did

450
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,699
It was a friendly gesture

451
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,309
What's wrong with that?

452
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:43,778
What is this guy, her pimp?

453
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,282
You saw what happened

454
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,490
All I did was telling the truth

455
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:08,003
We just talked right? Right

456
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,808
Hello!

457
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,873
Anyone?

458
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,177
Hey!

459
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,286
Let's have dinner together later

460
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,986
Didn't quite work out today

461
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:37,193
So why did you get involved?

462
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,202
How can I just watch then?

463
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,805
So are you gonna treat me
to dinner or what?

464
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,309
Well... I'm sorry for all this, but...

465
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,774
I could treat, you know

466
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,381
NA Nan... out!

467
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,399
Hey!

468
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,302
You're not gonna leave me here
are you?

469
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,902
Let's go

470
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:21,307
Have a good time

471
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,675
Hey! Hey!

472
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,282
I got my pride back
for the first time in a long time

473
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:31,081
It's still working

474
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,185
Do I need anything else?

475
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,489
You would need collateral

476
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,391
Collateral... hmmm...

477
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,690
Collateral?

478
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,498
Collateral!

479
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,696
You think start-up is for anyone?

480
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,500
Don't you trust me, dad?
It'll be quick, okay?

481
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,875
You know me, dad!

482
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,481
Just get married!

483
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,882
I'm not getting married.
I need to start my business

484
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,590
- You little...
- Well, I...

485
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,988
Come on, this is my last wish

486
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,186
You never do anything for me!

487
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,593
Christ... what am I doing here?
Should I carry them then?

488
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,703
Then...

489
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,198
you expect me to carry them?

490
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,799
Just pay the bill soon

491
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,503
Hey, this is nothing you know

492
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,080
Once I start my biz
I'll pay you back ten-fold

493
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,274
You're serious about this, huh?

494
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,678
You wanna work with me?

495
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:44,591
Look at you all excited over a bill

496
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,396
Let me in on your start-up

497
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,996
I bet I could work with you in style

498
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,599
You sure know
what you talking about

499
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,306
Come here

500
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,879
I'll give you

501
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,684
A kiss

502
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,486
What are you doing?

503
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,589
- I'm serious
- Wait

504
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,992
If you cross this line
I don't know...

505
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,492
Oh, yeah?

506
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,392
What are you gonna do
about that, huh?

507
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,989
- I might really go for it
- Yeah? Come on!

508
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,603
Wait, wait I think I could do better

509
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,503
Wrong! You know
how popular I am, Come here

510
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,506
You and your action plans...
let's stop

511
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,806
This is no action plan.
What are you doing in there?

512
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,677
- Let's stop, Dong-mi
- You're just too cute, you...

513
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,275
- Come here, here
- You're killing me

514
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,683
- Kiss is not for a person my age
- What's killing you?

515
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:50,283
You're sooo cute, you.
Come here, you...

516
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,400
I thought you had a date today?

517
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,208
Today's the day

518
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:14,179
I may have failed my diet
'cause of drinking

519
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,186
but I still look darn good

520
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,087
I'm coming, LEE Ji-hoon!

521
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,395
Hey, long time no see.
Why didn't you guys call?

522
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,797
He looks good over there

523
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,700
He used to be a little skinny
before though

524
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,103
- But now...
- Hey, stop, stop

525
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,106
Whatever... look at your belly

526
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,308
Hook me with a girl

527
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,175
He's looking

528
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,315
He's looking at me

529
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,319
Yeah, lose some weight!

530
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,777
Look! I'm doing just fine without you

531
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,493
Act confident.
You're good, NA Nan!

532
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,289
Wait!

533
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,895
You go, girl!

534
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,786
Welcome to Chili's!

535
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,089
Oh my...

536
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,091
How have you been?

537
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,894
Come on, answer him!

538
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,796
I got relocated
to the restaurant division

539
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,393
I heard.
So you're a manager, huh?

540
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:50,378
- So work is fun?
- Yeah...

541
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,877
Want some coupons?

542
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,385
Oh my god

543
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,489
- Oh lord! Daddy, my stomach!
- Give me some pepper powder

544
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,090
- Want some coupons?
- Funny?

545
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,192
I wanna kill myself

546
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,900
She's turning into you

547
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,006
What?

548
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,506
She just looked like
female godfather

549
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,304
So?

550
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,970
This is what
the world's done to me

551
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,172
I used to

552
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,878
get scared by bugs

553
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,491
Like your girl friend, you know

554
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,494
Why are you brining her up?

555
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:43,896
- What's wrong? Things aren't working out?
- How would I know?

556
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,492
Jesus, Lim, Jeong Joon!

557
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,105
That's what love is all about.
Just let it be

558
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,809
This tastes good!

559
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:00,777
Hey, this is no laundry.
You're making the Kimchi all soggy

560
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,686
- Do you guys Do That too?
- What?

561
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,882
Are all women like that?

562
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,090
What are you talking about?

563
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,394
Forget it

564
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,192
What?

565
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:18,392
This guy's been asking me out

566
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,996
He's tall, able
and his family's pretty well-off

567
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,600
And I like him too.
What should I do?

568
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:34,578
Kill the fuckers, don't you think?

569
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,183
So

570
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,383
she's been double playing

571
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,794
Don't talk like that

572
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:48,888
I'm still young.
I still want to do things

573
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,194
And meet new people

574
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,599
That's bull shit

575
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:58,006
She never considered
marriage with me

576
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,802
I mean...

577
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,311
who would want to marry
someone like me anyways?

578
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:07,075
So? You guys are breaking up?

579
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,378
We don't have to break up
just because we're not getting married

580
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,683
We could be good friends.
You know, like Dong-mi and Nan

581
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:16,281
- Can you be friends with her?
- No

582
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,386
- So what did you say?
- I said let's be friends, then

583
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:24,096
You idiot!

584
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,494
I'll make her so happy

585
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:30,900
That she'll never be able to forget
about me

586
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,804
Whatever!

587
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,511
I will never let him forget me
for the rest of his life

588
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,671
For the rest of his life?

589
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:41,478
Write a god damn novel

590
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,483
Do you know
what she's doing to you?

591
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:48,283
The other guy's rice
and you're noodles

592
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,586
No one likes eating rice everyday

593
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,196
So she wants to have noodles
every now and then

594
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,594
Ji-hae likes noodles better

595
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:00,693
She just wants good memories

596
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,205
She'll get married
to some rich guy

597
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,003
and have you hanging
on the side

598
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,203
You know what I'm talking about

599
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:13,680
It's like sticking gum under your desk
and chewing it at your convenience

600
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,977
You're just
a piece of gum to her, idiot!

601
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,988
When will you grow up?

602
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:22,286
You're too old for that shit

603
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:26,294
Stop talking like that, Dong-mi

604
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,294
Hey, she's selling herself

605
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,698
She's just looking for
security in life

606
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,997
I said, stop talking like that

607
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,004
Like you have the right
to talk like that?

608
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,403
Fuck

609
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,705
At least, I don't sell myself

610
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,871
I leave everything in the open.
You got a problem with that?

611
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,483
- Leaving everything in the open?
- That's right!

612
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,677
Oh, okay... so that's love

613
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,381
I'm sorry, but why is it so funny

614
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,389
Hearing the word love from you

615
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,396
Asshole!

616
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,503
Hey, Dong-mi, come on out!

617
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,009
And Joon, apologize!

618
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:20,483
What the hell is this while making Kimchi?
You're supposed to be friends

619
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,084
I'm really pissed now

620
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,685
Shoot... how am I gonna
take the Kimchi home now?

621
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,192
Excuse me!

622
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,903
Hey

623
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,908
Hop in

624
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,582
Why?

625
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,284
Thought you'd be tired
and I have a car so...

626
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:05,384
I'm tired alright

627
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:09,793
And it's probably impolite
to turn him down

628
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,201
- Don't you wanna know who I am?
- What?

629
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,613
Oh... sure...

630
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,481
I work for Uno Securities.
My name is PARK Soo-heon

631
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,080
Okay

632
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,383
I used to work upstairs from you

633
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,087
Oh

634
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,886
How about a date

635
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,088
One day?

636
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:19,601
Excuse me?

637
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,109
What do we do now?

638
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,884
Hey

639
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,988
Are you sure you can fix it?

640
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,991
Didn't I tell you?

641
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,595
I used to be a mechanic
in the army

642
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,999
Good night

643
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:12,986
Seoul 31 BA 9160...
Seoul 31 BA 9160...

644
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,990
Aquarium?

645
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:22,098
Does he want to go fishing
or something?

646
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,100
I don't think he'll give up easily

647
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:29,599
Don't eat anything
just because you're hungry

648
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,109
Shoot, bust again

649
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,074
Don't rush into anything

650
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,182
- Here are utility bills
- Hold on one sec

651
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,774
I put mine down
so you pay the rest tomorrow

652
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,998
You didn't make up yet?

653
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,603
Hey! Lend me some money

654
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,299
I want to get out of here
but don't have enough deposit

655
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,500
Lee, Dong-mi

656
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,203
It was deposit that got you into
living with Joon in the first place

657
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,179
Do you even know how expensive
the rents are these days?

658
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,079
Forget it then!

659
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,185
I won't ever ask you
for money again

660
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,788
If you make up with Joon
I'll lend you the money

661
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:21,188
Forget about it

662
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,392
I'd rather get a loan

663
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,491
I am sure of it

664
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,791
You know how he is bet
he's losing sleep over this

665
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,900
figuring out how to make up

666
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,795
He just left

667
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,599
his share of the utility payment
down to a cent

668
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,809
In any case, if you want my money
make up with him

669
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,397
- Hey!
- Hey!

670
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,702
You go first

671
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:20,076
I'm moving out
before the end of next month

672
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,784
I said, I'm moving out!

673
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,584
I'm not kidding, you know

674
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,295
Okay

675
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,894
Hey

676
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,597
Come sit over here

677
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,075
Either find another roommate

678
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:55,981
Or you can take over my deposit

679
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,383
Okay

680
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:06,588
I apologize for bringing in
different guys all the time

681
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:11,194
That won't happen again
until I move out

682
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,602
Good for you, huh?

683
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:20,199
You can
walk around naked now

684
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,477
I'm not being sarcastic

685
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,082
- Hey, listen...
- You listen...

686
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:30,584
So don't bring that bitch
back here until I move out

687
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,582
I don't want to see her ever again

688
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,691
- That slut got us into this
- Hey! Dong-mi!

689
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,487
She has a name you know

690
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:42,496
Whatever... she's a bitch

691
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,400
Want me to say that again?

692
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:48,095
B I T C H

693
00:51:55,445 --> 00:52:02,283
- Off of me! - Nope
Not happening

694
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,979
You bastard...
come on, I'm dizzy

695
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,688
Ji-hae said...

696
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,793
she said I'm a nice guy

697
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,701
But then you know what?

698
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,704
I'm a nice guy she doesn't
want to be with

699
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,403
Nice guy equals

700
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,375
loser!

701
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,683
Nice guy...

702
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:38,187
You see... nice guy is
the only thing I can be

703
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,993
I...

704
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,093
don't have money

705
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,192
and I don't have connections

706
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,997
I mean...

707
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,608
what's wrong with
my parents being farmers?

708
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,377
I'm not ashamed of my family

709
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,481
Should I be, Dong-mi?

710
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,676
Idiot!

711
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,787
That's right, I'm an idiot

712
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:21,091
You really are an idiot

713
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,198
You're not the only one

714
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,405
Come on, stop

715
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,307
Come on, stop

716
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,976
Come on, stop

717
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,481
Hey, Mr Crocodile!
Crocodile!

718
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,583
Look at that fishy!

719
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,201
He's a menace

720
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,679
Dong-mi's right

721
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:58,481
I shouldn't eat anything
just because I'm hungry

722
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:04,987
Don't get too close.
It's hot

723
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,892
You know my arms
are cramping up too

724
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,900
This feels much better

725
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,711
Creepy and boring...

726
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:25,076
Childish and greasy too

727
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,280
Could be worse though

728
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,385
I mean... at least his looks
are somewhat decent

729
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,986
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm watching a play

730
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,893
What?

731
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,699
Hello?

732
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,106
- Okay, hang up, I'm here
- What are you doing?

733
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,178
What?

734
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,180
What? You slept with Joon?

735
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:04,082
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry I'm late

736
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:19,793
Why do you have to
come home so late?

737
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,498
What brings you here?
Wanna sleep over, huh?

738
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,804
Of course!
How am I supposed to see him?

739
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:33,873
I don't care.
I'm out of this

740
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,282
It's all because of you!
You told me to make up with him

741
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,183
and look what happened
It's all your fault!

742
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:44,389
I told you to make up with him
not sleep with him

743
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:57,103
Just get over here!

744
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,982
Guys...

745
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,384
Why don't you two just get married?

746
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,392
- What?
- Hey!

747
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,791
You guys are sharing
the same house anyway

748
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,294
Why not share the same bed?

749
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,097
Not in a million years

750
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,603
That's total nonsense

751
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,708
I'd rather go to hell

752
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,107
Same here! No way!

753
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,282
So then why did you do it?

754
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,475
Why did I do it?

755
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,286
See ya!

756
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,988
So we finally came to
an agreement over few drinks

757
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,995
We decided to forget about
that night's little trouble

758
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:01,194
Don't sleep again, okay?

759
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,704
Of course I'll sleep.
I'm going home

760
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,207
But I wished they would sleep again

761
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:10,176
And get married

762
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,878
They could make a great couple

763
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,481
Is this what you call service?

764
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,182
I'm terribly sorry.
There was a slight mix-up

765
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:25,192
I could let go of the late order

766
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,091
but you didn't even get
the order right

767
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,595
I was sure that
the order I got was...

768
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,790
That's okay.
I got this

769
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,601
I'm so sorry. I will have the
ordered plate for you immediately

770
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,501
Please be understanding.
Enjoy your meal

771
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,005
And again, I'm terribly sorry

772
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:43,010
Is this your first time here?

773
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:46,582
You can't just take orders randomly

774
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,583
You need to pace the orders
so that I can work at ease

775
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,179
Get a pace

776
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,292
You can't just be running around

777
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,792
like maniacs and
expect things to work

778
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,299
Train your people right!

779
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:21,874
Sorry

780
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,780
I'm sorry

781
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,681
Sorry

782
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,497
Not easy, huh?

783
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,205
When you're feeling like that just say

784
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,381
This fuckin' sucks!

785
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,079
Come on, try it!

786
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,678
Huh?

787
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:38,487
Is there anything that you can do?

788
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,495
You can't smoke, you can't swear...

789
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,992
can you at least drink?

790
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:47,296
Oh yeah... you can fight

791
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,993
It's that good?

792
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,169
What is it?

793
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,605
Hey!

794
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,171
Yes?

795
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,877
If...

796
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:37,183
your husband gave you
ten grand each month

797
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,889
would you stay home or work?

798
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:46,684
What do you think?

799
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:53,099
Well... I think you'd work

800
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:59,201
And then, you'd probably
bitch about it everyday

801
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,311
And if your husband told you to quit working,
you'd bitch about that too

802
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:06,777
You are right on.
Perhaps you should become a fortune teller

803
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:11,078
Are we feeling comfortable now?

804
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,379
I don't know... whatever...

805
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:18,884
This is good.
I like this

806
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,690
Honey!

807
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,399
Honey... honey.
I like the sound of that

808
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,801
I want to hear you call me honey
from now on

809
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,907
I'm don't like the way
you talk to me

810
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,101
How old are you?

811
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,375
25...

812
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,679
since four years ago

813
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:54,596
Let me see

814
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:12,574
- I only have coffee
- I don't care if it's tap water

815
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,388
This is good

816
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,587
I asked him
for a cup of coffee, but

817
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,189
maybe I shouldn't have
let him in

818
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,600
Why do I feel like
I'm the inviting one?

819
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,892
I think I need to go

820
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,897
I don't know

821
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:12,496
what I'll do if I stay

822
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:17,479
That's it for today

823
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,783
Nan...

824
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:36,587
keep your door locked.
I might just burst in later

825
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:44,300
- Good bye
- See you

826
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:32,585
Can't go like this.
I just can't

827
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:41,390
I can't go like this

828
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,675
Maybe this is too fast.
This is way too fast

829
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,882
I should stop.
I need to be rational

830
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,378
Is this a dream?

831
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,386
That's because you haven't
been getting any lately

832
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:21,189
Just like people need to
eat to live

833
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,888
sex is the same

834
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:27,196
You need to have it every
now and then to stay healthy

835
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:30,901
You really need to work on that

836
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:39,071
Is this because I'm near
my period, you think?

837
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,910
Sleep with him!

838
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:48,288
Are you crazy? I don't even
know how this is gonna go

839
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:52,993
That's why you need
to sleep with him

840
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,098
You need to check things out
before you become too attached

841
01:08:56,232 --> 01:09:01,101
In any case, if your body
wants it, you need to have it

842
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,296
Fucking sexaphoic

843
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,880
Your order's ready

844
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,082
Carribean salad

845
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,693
and fajita steak nachos

846
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:27,996
Old timer's ready

847
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:32,697
If you need ketchup, it's over here

848
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:37,096
Do you need anything else?
If you need drinks or...

849
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,674
Can you clean this up.
Enjoy your meal

850
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:59,287
How about the bund?

851
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,990
Next time

852
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,898
Do you want to go
get some coffee?

853
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,697
I know this sky lounge

854
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,406
They have a great view

855
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,376
Are you tired?

856
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,682
A little

857
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,685
- Can you turn that down a little?
- Sure

858
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:43,803
I said, turn it down!

859
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,787
What's wrong?

860
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,393
I'm sorry.
I just have a headache

861
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,591
- I'll get some aspirin.
- Don't bother. Pharmacies are closed

862
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:12,894
Convenient stores are open

863
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,697
I said, don't bother.
Don't make me talk

864
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,606
Can't you see I'm not feeling well?

865
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:24,474
Couldn't you just play along?

866
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:30,476
You should've told me

867
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,682
You can't tell?

868
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:36,985
Do I have to tell you everything?

869
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,193
Forget it!

870
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:06,081
What's with you?

871
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:08,280
You've been
making me feel uncomfortable

872
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,983
Uncomfortable?

873
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,287
How can you sing
if you feel uncomfortable?

874
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,398
Sorry for singing... jesus

875
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,494
Maybe I should of cried

876
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,299
Why are you being sarcastic?

877
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,204
When was I being sarcastic?

878
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,871
Nan!
Tell me what happened

879
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,676
Couldn't you just do that?

880
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:39,186
Just talk about things with me?
What am I?

881
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,086
Your chauffer?

882
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,287
I never asked you for a ride

883
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,792
You liked it! You'd get mad
if I didn't pick you up

884
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,290
Whatever... you and
your piece of shit car

885
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:54,787
I...

886
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,593
met him today

887
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:09,304
He's getting married

888
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:21,380
I was doing so well...

889
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:48,878
He said she's really nice

890
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,885
And he said he's sorry

891
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,503
You...

892
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,698
tried hard to love him...

893
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,711
and

894
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:20,977
you tried hard to forget him

895
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,179
That's all that matters

896
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:16,903
Did I wake you?

897
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,778
Want some coffee?

898
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,790
Sure

899
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,796
This is good

900
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,707
Close your eyes

901
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:58,470
Come on

902
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,393
All set

903
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,783
It's been a while since
I've been carrying it around

904
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,081
I know that this maybe
a little awkward

905
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:46,091
But let me get this over with

906
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:54,995
Will you marry me?

907
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,005
There are only two things
to ask yourself at our age

908
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,669
Will he make a lot of money?

909
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:07,373
Or will he fulfill my desires

910
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:11,083
every night?

911
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,286
You know...

912
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,292
I want to marry someone

913
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:23,592
that is madly in love with me

914
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:26,293
You like him, don't you?

915
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,903
Yeah

916
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,699
I like him

917
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,777
but I'm not sure if it's love

918
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:40,473
Let's drop everything

919
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,083
and just get married

920
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,882
Marriage?

921
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:53,290
Hey! That's the only way we'll
make big money at this age

922
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,789
Only then, our parents will
let loose some funds

923
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:59,697
And we can start up a
company with that money

924
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:03,500
That's fraud

925
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,798
How's that fraud?

926
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:09,308
I'll stay married and just use
the money for business

927
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:15,581
What if your husband
doesn't let you?

928
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,081
That's his loss.
If he doesn't

929
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:22,782
want in, that's his problem

930
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,490
If not, forget it

931
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:32,891
- Then marry Joon!
- Hey!

932
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:35,803
If not, forget it

933
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,403
Stop making jokes like that

934
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:43,409
Do you even know
how he's doing?

935
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:44,570
What?

936
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,774
You mean, with Ji-hae?

937
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,285
She's quitting her job

938
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:54,286
She just needs to fix
the wedding date

939
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:59,385
That's impressive

940
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:04,590
I'm impressed by Joon
and his idiotic nature

941
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,894
Sometimes I feel like
he's mentally challenged

942
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:10,994
I mean why would you waste
time on something like that?

943
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,278
They say love lasts

944
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,082
That's why he's an idiot

945
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,782
I had one already

946
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:28,888
They say eating lasts

947
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,978
Really!

948
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:03,789
You happy?

949
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,393
Man... I'm sweating

950
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,697
Of course I'm happy

951
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,807
Let me ask you the question again

952
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,778
Would you quit if I gave
you ten grand each month?

953
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,576
What if I quit?

954
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,880
You can study

955
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,285
I know you still want to work
in the fashion industry

956
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,684
Why don't you get
into it aggressively

957
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,886
You know in studying

958
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:45,997
Study?

959
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,797
To be frank...

960
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:53,606
I think I'll get
relocated to New York

961
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:58,274
That's why I rushed our marriage

962
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,381
Now you can study...

963
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,378
of course

964
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:06,712
without the ten grand I promised

965
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:08,887
What is there to think?

966
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,889
Isn't that what you
wanted all along?

967
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,085
You're right

968
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,493
Fix him some breakfast each morning

969
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:19,896
get jiggy at night and

970
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:23,004
he'll pay for your tuition, living expenses...

971
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:26,301
you just hit the jackpot

972
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,103
You're right

973
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:32,475
You meet a man
and problems solved

974
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,878
God, how unfair

975
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:38,179
Stop it I'm not even sure...

976
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,778
it just doesn't feel right

977
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,489
Whatever... that's your luck

978
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,287
What ever happened
to the blind date?

979
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:47,986
Forget it

980
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,689
Do you know how it feels
to be a chunk of meat?

981
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:54,199
I can't handle the thought

982
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:58,204
Well, congrats to you!

983
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,908
Thanks!

984
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:07,174
I don't know
what's wrong with me

985
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:11,774
You said you weren't feeling well
before too, Go take a dump

986
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:31,699
- This is good
- What?

987
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,501
Now you two can get married

988
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:34,804
What?

989
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:39,175
This is why Joon got dumped and
you never had a decent boyfriend

990
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:42,977
Why didn't I think of this before?
Now I can leave carefree

991
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:46,576
I knew there was something
left unfinished. This was it!

992
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,789
Now you can start
up your business

993
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,788
Joon will say yes

994
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:55,089
and I'll throw you guys a party

995
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,595
Congratulations!

996
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:59,393
You're not feeling well, are you?

997
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,297
This is it.
Marriage and start-up all at once...

998
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:05,099
Congrats, you bitch

999
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:09,107
I think Joon's here

1000
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,176
- Hey, hey!
- Nan, you're here!

1001
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,973
Joon, look.
Look

1002
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:16,277
- What's that?
- Two lines, you see?

1003
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,978
- It means pregnant. Isn't it great?
- Yeah! How awesome?

1004
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,884
- You have a baby
- That's so great!

1005
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:23,888
Congratulations.
I really mean it!

1006
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:28,485
She got the ring
and they set the wedding date

1007
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,488
I can't believe it

1008
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:33,692
Are you that happy?
You should be ashamed of yourself

1009
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:36,895
Congratulations! That's great!
You finally did it, huh?

1010
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:38,938
Don't worry
there's nothing to be ashamed of

1011
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:39,735
That's right

1012
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:41,308
What do you want to eat?
I'll cook it for you

1013
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,877
She wants meat

1014
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,071
You sure it's not you
that wants it?

1015
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:49,080
- Okay, meat it is
- Right on

1016
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,582
Wait!

1017
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:55,387
If you say a word...
I'm going to kill you!

1018
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,688
I decided to go to Chun-cheon

1019
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,394
What?

1020
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,395
Didn't I tell you this before?

1021
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,592
Director Park wants me to come

1022
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,401
So I was going to tell you
two to merge, but guess not

1023
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:14,201
Dong-mi, you should
look for a new roommate

1024
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:17,470
I guess so

1025
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:20,080
- Are you for real?
- Sure

1026
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:22,479
I like being home

1027
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,286
Hey, Dong-mi!
What are you doing over there?

1028
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,388
Come here and peel onions at least

1029
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:29,986
Why just me all the time?

1030
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,093
Do you want pregnant
Nan to do it then?

1031
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,092
When will you grow up?

1032
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:37,891
You're right.
What was I thinking

1033
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:41,991
Hey, Nan... stay still, okay?

1034
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:45,801
Let's party!

1035
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,407
What should I do?

1036
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,380
We were far from our dreams

1037
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:56,382
but we celebrated anyway

1038
01:25:57,018 --> 01:26:00,977
Congratulations on running away
from a broken relationship, Joon!

1039
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:04,990
Congratulations on getting pregnant
with your friend's baby, Dong-mi!

1040
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:08,186
Nan! Congratulations for the
hideout marriage from reality!

1041
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,593
Congratulations.
I really mean it...

1042
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:19,504
Sir, should I change this
design slightly, or no?

1043
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:21,006
- I think the color looks good
- It looks good?

1044
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,200
Nan!

1045
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,772
What are you doing here?
Are you back?

1046
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:28,382
No, I have a meeting here

1047
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,279
Long time no see

1048
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:32,386
I heard that the new
brand is a home-run

1049
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,683
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, Nan All thanks to you

1050
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:39,088
What are you talking about.
That's totally all you

1051
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:41,323
- Mr Chun!
- Yeah

1052
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,693
How have you been?

1053
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:46,791
I was a little worried
are you sure you are alright?

1054
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,596
I don't remember much

1055
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:51,296
Hey, do you want to
go grab some coffee?

1056
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,304
Didn't we have it before?

1057
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:56,406
I need to get running

1058
01:26:56,911 --> 01:27:00,677
You'll come and help boost
sales next time, right?

1059
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:02,380
- Have a good day
- See you

1060
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:04,178
- Mr Chun!
- What?

1061
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,082
Keep up the good work!

1062
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,484
Keep up the good work!

1063
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:10,591
- See you later, Nan
- Okay, See you!

1064
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:14,286
- Oh, bye
- Take care

1065
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:28,398
When I saw them, I suddenly
came up with a thought

1066
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:31,271
Do I belong here?
Maybe I do... yeah...

1067
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:33,876
or maybe not

1068
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:35,482
Thank you for coming

1069
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,585
Maybe it's here

1070
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:39,579
Or maybe it isn't

1071
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:42,986
- Thank you for coming
- I don't know

1072
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,690
What the hell

1073
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:51,622
Here comes a new dish

1074
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,799
Um, I...

1075
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,672
- So long
- What?

1076
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:05,676
I'm quitting

1077
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:10,081
My kid's pretty big now

1078
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,482
and it's too hard to manage

1079
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,779
But...

1080
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:19,689
She wants to put more time
into her kid's education

1081
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:24,187
You should leave it to the school.
That's not enough

1082
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:28,597
So I filed a recommendation

1083
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:33,002
for branch manager position
with both of your names

1084
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:36,868
Don't get upset because neither
of you don't make the position

1085
01:28:38,112 --> 01:28:42,981
- Actually, I was going to...
- I don't know what's going on

1086
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:49,087
but let's do what we can

1087
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:07,198
FIT is a school
Calvin Klein went to

1088
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,906
Parsons is supposed
to be good too

1089
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:13,171
I think we'll need two cars too

1090
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,373
You have a license, right?

1091
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:22,889
I have to go, right?

1092
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,085
Right!

1093
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:31,592
Why?

1094
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:35,494
You don't want to
live in a foreign country?

1095
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:40,105
Well... no...

1096
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:44,873
Oh, and...

1097
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,880
- Again?
- I know...

1098
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:28,882
Here, eat I heard

1099
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:31,683
that it's the same as
having born a baby

1100
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:35,286
So eat everything, okay?

1101
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,399
Did you tell Mr. Securities?

1102
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:42,594
Wear long sleeves even if it's hot.
Don't expose yourself to cold

1103
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:47,204
Really think about it whether
it's work or marriage

1104
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,309
Got that?

1105
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:53,378
Any side effects?

1106
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:58,374
They said I might not be able
to have a baby ever again

1107
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,987
You poor thing...

1108
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:07,292
I just can't believe this.
I can't believe it!

1109
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:12,195
Did you have to do it
after having heard that?

1110
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,995
You should've just had the baby

1111
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:22,304
Don't worry.
You'll have a baby again

1112
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:24,574
You're right

1113
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,675
What?

1114
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:33,287
I knew you would react like that

1115
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,680
so I didn't get it

1116
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:42,493
Hey, get up! Get up!

1117
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,598
Where are we going?

1118
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:45,699
To the hospital

1119
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,495
You think this is funny?

1120
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:53,005
Oh... my belly...

1121
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:56,200
What? What?

1122
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:59,174
Watch your mouth!
The baby's listening

1123
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:03,984
What are you kidding me?

1124
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,381
The baby's so sensitive

1125
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,990
that once the camera was put on
It raised his hand like this

1126
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:11,989
Hi!

1127
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,892
Where?

1128
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,397
Oh my...

1129
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:22,197
Isn't it adorable?

1130
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:30,370
Let's go!

1131
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:32,777
What if I want it?

1132
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:35,075
Then stop Joon

1133
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:38,383
You have the right to do
that and marry him

1134
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:41,682
What if I don't want to get married?

1135
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:43,289
Why?

1136
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:46,393
Then why would
you want the baby?

1137
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:49,992
- Because it's mine
- What?

1138
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,891
It's my baby

1139
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,401
So are you sacrificing for Joon?

1140
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,479
The baby's listening

1141
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:09,777
Okay, okay

1142
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,879
Ok?

1143
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:18,890
Listen you don't have
anything got that?

1144
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:24,496
If you have the baby you won't get a job

1145
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:30,571
nobody will date you nor marry you

1146
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,508
Are you okay with that?

1147
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:38,169
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

1148
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:40,177
Why can't I date people

1149
01:33:40,314 --> 01:33:45,581
when I'm this sexy?

1150
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,680
Plus, I'm going to make a lot of money

1151
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:52,589
and live happily ever after

1152
01:33:54,528 --> 01:33:56,587
Christ

1153
01:33:57,331 --> 01:34:01,199
You might lose your father, mother

1154
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,701
and Joon all together

1155
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:06,204
Are you sure

1156
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,308
you can handle that?

1157
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:10,672
I got you, don't?

1158
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:38,303
What is it?

1159
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,008
Jesus...

1160
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:44,374
Didn't tell you not to drink
that much?

1161
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,480
You're fucking up your stomach

1162
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:48,775
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay

1163
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:57,081
You sure?

1164
01:34:57,224 --> 01:35:00,489
Yeah, get out!
I'm going to pee

1165
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:02,793
Oh... okay

1166
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:08,401
Hey, Dong-mi

1167
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:11,304
why don't you come with me?

1168
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:14,608
We can share offices
and work together

1169
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,374
- Joon!
- Yeah?

1170
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,274
Worry about yourself

1171
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:24,374
- Think about it
- If Dong-mi leaves, Seoul will cry

1172
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,688
Just get me a boyfriend
before you leave

1173
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:30,490
Fool!

1174
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:33,787
Is that so hard?

1175
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:36,790
You inconsiderate asshole...

1176
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,703
- Here!
- What?

1177
01:35:42,837 --> 01:35:46,898
I think you forgot,
but I'm a man too, you know

1178
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,574
I'll let you borrow me
one last time

1179
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:52,269
Okay

1180
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:58,382
How's that?

1181
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:02,189
Hug me harder

1182
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:04,489
Like this?

1183
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,087
Harder

1184
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,397
Harder?

1185
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:15,893
This is pathetic

1186
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:25,372
Dong-mi finally started her
business through her fan club

1187
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:27,178
Those people would die for her

1188
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:30,181
if they had to

1189
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:33,682
Or that's what she says at least

1190
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:43,492
Who is it?

1191
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,496
Is it you?

1192
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:47,791
Is it you?

1193
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:51,903
Can't be all of you...

1194
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:19,290
Are you still
going to have the baby?

1195
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,069
What if your baby asks

1196
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:33,271
who the father is later?

1197
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:36,383
My baby will only thank me

1198
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:40,078
for bringing it into this world

1199
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,501
Okay

1200
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:58,505
it's your choice

1201
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:03,669
Just do it

1202
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:09,881
I'll be the father,
and you can be the mother

1203
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:15,286
I'll go out and make
money to buy milk

1204
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:19,588
If someone gives you shit

1205
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:23,185
I'll handle it

1206
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:27,999
Nan...

1207
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:39,270
And if anyone looks down on

1208
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:49,788
you for being a single mom
I'll beat the crap out of them

1209
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:54,093
So don't worry, okay?

1210
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:59,889
Got that, LEE Dong-mi?

1211
01:39:00,234 --> 01:39:02,202
Whatever

1212
01:39:09,743 --> 01:39:14,271
You should've said something already
Who washes their face in the kitchen?

1213
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:19,682
I felt bad, that's why

1214
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,388
Don't feel sorry

1215
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,288
Soo-heon

1216
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:37,297
Sorry

1217
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:41,999
I thought

1218
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:47,175
I had talent in fashion

1219
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:51,680
But I think it was all fruitless

1220
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:55,880
Trying so hard
to reach for the stars

1221
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:05,494
But when I started to work here

1222
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:10,392
One day, I just felt like
maybe this is it

1223
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:15,002
I'm not exactly sure
if I have talent in this

1224
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:18,673
but I want to try

1225
01:40:21,815 --> 01:40:25,182
I want to see the end of it

1226
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:29,585
I need to figure out
what I'm made of

1227
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:33,391
That's the first step
I need to take, right?

1228
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,098
So...

1229
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,496
That's why I can't get married

1230
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:58,781
For a while
Is anything else broken?

1231
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:17,603
Tell me now I don't want

1232
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:24,777
you washing your face
in the toilet

1233
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,785
Don't worry!
I can take care of myself

1234
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:49,500
Did I ever tell you that

1235
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:52,804
I'm really good at waiting?

1236
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:03,574
Romantic, huh?

1237
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:06,579
Yeah

1238
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,407
Stop! Stop!

1239
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:38,484
So we're here

1240
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,178
Thank the lord

1241
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:47,588
Huh?

1242
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:51,596
I took care of everything.
You won't have any problems

1243
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:06,972
I'm gonna get going

1244
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:10,774
Let's part here

1245
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:13,784
I don't want to make a
scene at the departure gate

1246
01:43:13,921 --> 01:43:16,583
You know...
people crying, hugging

1247
01:43:16,723 --> 01:43:19,089
running back from the gate...

1248
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:22,988
With the camera spinning
and all?

1249
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:24,995
Exactly

1250
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:37,376
I'm gonna go

1251
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:56,989
That's it

1252
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:09,604
I'm really going

1253
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:30,690
Don't expect me

1254
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:33,800
to run
back to you from the gate!

1255
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:36,903
Just go!

1256
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,197
Okay

1257
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:16,601
As soon as he left
everything became unclear

1258
01:45:16,743 --> 01:45:19,576
Out of sight, out of mind...

1259
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:23,080
will we last as a couple?

1260
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:27,080
Will I do well at work?

1261
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:29,786
One thing was sure...

1262
01:45:29,923 --> 01:45:32,391
the fact that
nothing has yet happened

1263
01:45:32,526 --> 01:45:34,687
And whatever happens

1264
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:38,594
there'll be problems for
which answers exist

1265
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:10,496
Isn't it cool?

1266
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:12,495
The voice is so cute

1267
01:46:12,632 --> 01:46:15,294
What's with the color though?

1268
01:46:15,435 --> 01:46:18,199
Are you sure you used
to be a designer?

1269
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:21,207
I think your taste is a little off.
You think our baby will like it?

1270
01:46:21,341 --> 01:46:23,309
I'm not exactly sure of its taste

1271
01:46:24,511 --> 01:46:25,978
Then...

1272
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:27,680
How cute are these?

1273
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:32,080
They're so cute.
So cute

1274
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:35,882
It's a doll, a doll.
I can't make up my mind

1275
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:38,691
You want me to
have daughters only?

1276
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:41,191
How would a boy manage laces or pink?

1277
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:44,195
I just can't make up my mind

1278
01:46:44,431 --> 01:46:46,490
Who cares!

1279
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:49,693
Couldn't you get something blue?

1280
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:58,172
How about this?

1281
01:46:59,312 --> 01:47:02,179
Sorry.
I'm going to breast feed

1282
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:07,678
Are you stupid? You can't
breast feed the whole time

1283
01:47:08,121 --> 01:47:11,284
Besides

1284
01:47:11,825 --> 01:47:13,986
you can use this for water

1285
01:47:14,127 --> 01:47:18,791
Oh yeah...
why didn't I think of that?

1286
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:20,490
Babies drink water, right?

1287
01:47:20,634 --> 01:47:23,398
I'm so stupid

1288
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:27,397
You'll love this one

1289
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:30,767
What's that?

1290
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:32,970
- Voila!
- What's all this?

1291
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:35,377
- Turn the switch on...
- Okay

1292
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:37,073
- And put it on your belly...
- Okay

1293
01:47:37,417 --> 01:47:40,284
Testing!

1294
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:42,982
Hey, baby... it's your auntie

1295
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:46,390
Or is it your aunt

1296
01:47:46,526 --> 01:47:49,495
- No, it's your daddy
- Can the baby really hear this?

1297
01:47:49,629 --> 01:47:51,096
- Of course
- So the baby's listening now?

1298
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:52,289
Yeah

1299
01:47:52,432 --> 01:47:55,697
Hey baby... are you listening?
This is your mom, over

1300
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:58,100
The lady that just talked to you

1301
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:00,502
never really liked you

1302
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,403
So...

1303
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:07,879
No, no... I really want to see you

1304
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:09,879
Same here! Listen to me, baby...

1305
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:12,985
It's going to take some time...

1306
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:16,389
In a few days, it will be new years

1307
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:18,586
I expected to solve

1308
01:48:18,725 --> 01:48:22,286
one of life's two homeworks
before I turned thirty

1309
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:25,992
Marriage or a successful career

1310
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:32,198
I'm still a single that didn't
succeed in my career

1311
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,102
Who cares though?

1312
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:37,176
I'll make something out of
myself before I turn thirty

1313
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:39,175
If not, whatever

1314
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:41,977
At age thirty

1315
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:44,276
it starts all over again

1316
01:48:44,618 --> 01:48:46,677
NA Nan... you go girl!

1317
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,781
Go girl!
