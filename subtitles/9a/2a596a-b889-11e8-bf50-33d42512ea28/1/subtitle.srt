1
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,435
<i>I don't have time.</i>

2
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,409
<i>I don't have time to
worry about haw it happened.</i>

3
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,710
<i>It is what it is.</i>

4
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,417
<i>We're genetically engineered
to stop aging at 25.</i>

5
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,485
<i>The trouble is,
we live only one more year</i>

6
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,419
<i>unless we can get more time.</i>

7
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,255
<i>Time is now the currency.</i>

8
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,928
<i>We earn it and spend it.</i>

9
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,270
<i>The rich can live forever.</i>

10
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,507
<i>And the rest of us?</i>

11
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,239
<i>I just want to wake up
with more time on my hand</i>

12
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,008
<i>than hours in the day.</i>

13
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,604
Hey, Mom.

14
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,574
You got in late last night.

15
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,241
I put in some overtime.

16
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,543
Where'd it go?

17
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,075
On you.

18
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,116
They drink it in New Greenwich.
Happy 50th!

19
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,280
Fifty?

20
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,090
That's right.

21
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,989
Twenty-five for the 25th time.

22
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,994
Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.

23
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,256
Here we go.

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,029
Bela's daughter is always asking about you.

25
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,766
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?

26
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,671
What do you got?

27
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,335
Three days. Not even.

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,009
We owe half that in rent.

29
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,173
Eight for the electric and
we're still late on that loan.

30
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,013
I can make extra on the side, you know.

31
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,114
- I could...
- What, start fighting?

32
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,779
Nobody wins.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,481
Yeah.

34
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,989
Remember, I'm not here tonight.

35
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,552
I got two days' work in
the garment district.

36
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,196
- I know.
- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.

37
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,358
- After I pay off the loan,
I won't have long. - I'll be there.

38
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,964
Will...

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,696
I just wouldn't know what
to do if I lost you.

40
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,967
I'm late.

41
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,803
Let me give you 30 minutes
so you can have a decent lunch.

42
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,818
I love you.

43
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,821
Happy birthday, Mom.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,960
When you get back,
we're going to celebrate.

45
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,504
Will!

46
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,834
Will!

47
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,836
You got a minute?

48
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,880
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.

49
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,083
Not a year I can use yet.

50
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,915
Come on, Will. I've got bills to pay.

51
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,220
Here, take five minutes.

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,092
Get out of here.

53
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,940
Four minutes for a cup of coffee?

54
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,450
Yesterday, it was three.

55
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,450
You want coffee or you want to reminisce?

56
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,051
Two coffees.

57
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,115
- How many shifts you got today, Borel?
- Just the two.

58
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,892
Really excited about it.

59
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,129
If you had any of your father in you,
we could make a fortune.

60
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,235
I don't fight.

61
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,308
There's another one. Broad daylight.

62
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,238
Whoa, what is this? Where's the rest?

63
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,470
Never met the quota.

64
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,015
My units are up from last week.

65
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,946
So's the quota. Next.

66
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,144
That's a joke, right?

67
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,646
- Next.
- Move it. You're taking forever.

68
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,302
You in, Will?

69
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,138
I don't have time to gamble any more.

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,867
Oh, thank God.

71
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,970
Because ever since you stopped playing,
I started winning.

72
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,208
You still owe me an hour.

73
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,316
You seen Borel?

74
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,992
- Will!
- Hey, man.

75
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,719
Your wife's looking for you.

76
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,821
You're not gonna believe it.

77
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,699
This madman's been buying drinks all night.
He's got a century!

78
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,066
Come on, let me get you home.

79
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,341
Soon as I finish this drink.

80
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,670
Hey! You!

81
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,134
You!

82
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,578
More everything!

83
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,577
Do you want to come home with me?

84
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,018
You can take us both home.

85
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,759
Excuse me.

86
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,529
You need to get out of here.

87
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,358
Somebody's gonna clean that clock.

88
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,595
Yes!

89
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,343
I mean, they aren't going to rob you.
They are going to kill you.

90
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,267
They can't take that much time

91
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,778
and let you live to tell about it.

92
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,869
Yes.

93
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,277
I don't think you understand.
You should not be here!

94
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,117
Will. Will!

95
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,893
Minutemen!

96
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,688
Minutemen! Walk away, Will.

97
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,430
Those gangsters aren't playing around.

98
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,768
Wait, wait.

99
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,572
He's asking for it. Let's go.
He's not one of us.

100
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,641
You think he'd help us?

101
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,136
Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.

102
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,737
Go.

103
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,946
The name's Fortis.

104
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,918
And that, sir, is a very nice watch.

105
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,092
Do you mind if I try it on?
I think it would suit me.

106
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,005
I'll tell you what.

107
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,103
I'll fight you for it.

108
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,670
Come on.

109
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,108
I'm an old man. Turned 75 last week.

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,687
I need a moment.

111
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,209
You ready to go?

112
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,541
Ready to go.

113
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,817
Let's get you out of here.

114
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,321
Get him!

115
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,492
Stop. What are you doing?
I can take care of myself.

116
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,155
Yeah, it looked like it.

117
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,459
I know what I'm doing.

118
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,728
Run. Run!

119
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,076
Come on!

120
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,583
Here!

121
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,413
Hurry!

122
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,756
Move!

123
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,371
Where the hell are you going? Get in here!

124
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,882
I know who took him.

125
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,151
I know who he is.

126
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,248
Who he was.

127
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,995
Damn it, damn it.

128
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,667
What the hell are you doing here?

129
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,602
Flashing all that?

130
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,902
You out of your mind?

131
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,504
Henry Hamilton.

132
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,939
Will Salas.

133
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,286
Ugh.

134
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,584
God.

135
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,524
Drink more, it gets better.

136
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,934
Not much better.

137
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,303
You'll be safe till morning.

138
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,309
I'll get you out of here.

139
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,217
You're from New Greenwich.

140
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,154
Does it show?

141
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,316
Nah.

142
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,325
Looks like you could use some help yourself.

143
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,898
No, thanks.

144
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,726
How old are you?

145
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,731
In real time?

146
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,837
Twenty-eight.

147
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,899
I'm 105.

148
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,507
Good for you.

149
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,008
You won't see 106, you have too many
more nights like tonight.

150
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,181
You are right.

151
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,176
But the day comes when you've had enough.

152
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,849
Your mind can be spent,
even if your body's not.

153
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,357
We want to die.

154
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,827
We need to.

155
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,538
That's your problem?
You've been alive too long?

156
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,434
You ever known anyone who's died?

157
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,948
For a few to be immortal, many must die.

158
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,460
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

159
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,789
You really don't know, do you?

160
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,966
Everyone can't live forever.
Where would we put them?

161
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,570
Why do you think there are Time Zones?

162
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,106
Why do you think taxes and prices go up

163
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,808
the same day in the ghetto?

164
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,754
The cost of living keeps rising to
make sure people keep dying.

165
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,319
How else could there be
men with a million years

166
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,825
while most live day to day?

167
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,993
But the truth is

168
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,665
there's more than enough.

169
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,100
No one has to die before their time.

170
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,016
If you had as much time
as I have on that clock,

171
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,080
what would you do with it?

172
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,622
I'd stop watching it.

173
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,630
I can tell you one thing.

174
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,125
If I had all that time,

175
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,205
I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.

176
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,881
Get some rest.

177
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,878
Don't worry. I won't take it in the night.

178
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,389
And I won't take yours.

179
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,864
It does get better.

180
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,494
- Oh, hey, Will.
- Hey, Greta.

181
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,561
Is Borel in?

182
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,396
Yeah. Borel?

183
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,132
Look at that.

184
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,998
A shame we gotta wait 25 years.

185
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,407
We could use that year right now.

186
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,567
Borel?

187
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,744
I'm here.

188
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,149
You'd better get her inside, Greta.

189
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,094
Look at this.

190
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,998
Where did you get that?

191
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,828
The guy at the bar.

192
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,168
They were going to kill him.

193
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,602
He gave it to me.

194
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,168
He timed himself out
before I could stop him.

195
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,680
No one gives anybody 100 years.

196
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,314
He didn't just give me this.

197
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,545
He gave me the truth about it.

198
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,314
You can't let anyone see that.

199
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,944
Hey.

200
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,250
You know that time will get you killed.

201
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,693
How long have we been friends?

202
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,595
What, 10 years?

203
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,261
Here.

204
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,108
A decade.

205
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,077
You've been like a brother.

206
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,544
Where are you going?

207
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,510
Where this won't look out of place.

208
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,649
I finally got the time to take my mom
to New Greenwich.

209
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,807
Greta, I'm going out!

210
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,275
<i>Loan payment received,
two days. Thank you.</i>

211
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,047
Dayton.

212
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,618
Two hours.

213
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,559
It's always been an hour.

214
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,996
Now it's two. Price went up.

215
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,057
Since when?

216
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,730
Since today.

217
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,062
My son is meeting me.
He'll pay the difference.

218
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,040
I can't do that, policy.

219
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,039
Please?

220
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,245
It's a two-hour walk.

221
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,582
I have an hour and a half.

222
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,022
Then you'd better run.

223
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,221
Stop! Please stop!

224
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,753
Wait! Please! Please, no!

225
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,824
Wait! No! Please!

226
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,615
Mom?

227
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,679
Will!

228
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,627
Will!

229
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,298
- Will!
- Mom!

230
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,369
No, no, no, no!

231
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,153
No!

232
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,655
Mom, Mom, Mom!

233
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,950
Thirteen zeros.

234
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,015
Unlucky for all.

235
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,159
The last time anyone saw him alive,

236
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,425
there was over a century on that clock.

237
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,423
Around here, they'd kill you for a week.

238
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,332
What was he doing in this Time Zone?

239
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,699
What I was thinking

240
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,441
was he might have brought this on himself.

241
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,103
Interesting. How long
you been keeping time, Jaeger?

242
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,473
Five years.

243
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,410
Let me know what you think
when you have been doing it for 50.

244
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,986
It doesn't matter why he came here.

245
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,512
What matters are the hundred years
that came with him.

246
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,921
Gotta be a witness.

247
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,025
Trust me, no one saw anything.

248
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,393
What would you like us to do, sir?

249
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,765
What we always do. Follow the time.

250
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,702
Hey, Ray. I'll give you 10 minutes
for an hour.

251
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,438
When are you gonna
get out of the game, Leila?

252
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,706
You gotta be pushing 60.

253
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,711
Thanks for letting everyone know.

254
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,183
<i>Am I in the right place?</i>

255
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,246
We don't normally make
pickups in this Zone.

256
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,250
I was lost.

257
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,158
<i>Please deposit
one month.</i>

258
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,785
<i>Please deposit two months.</i>

259
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,124
There are more of these than I remember.

260
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,438
That was a year.

261
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,815
Welcome to New Greenwich.

262
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,319
What are you really doing here?

263
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,816
I'm going to take them
for everything they've got.

264
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,162
I'm going to make them pay.

265
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,391
Please, miss. You can't be too careful.

266
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,161
Are you sure?

267
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,499
What's a night here cost?

268
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,540
Two months for a standard room.

269
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,403
Give me a suite.

270
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:54,982
Do you need help with your bags?

271
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,153
No.

272
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,096
- He's fast.
- He's going to have to be.

273
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,607
The camera doesn't show us
how the body got into the river.

274
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,441
What do we really know?

275
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,605
What do we know?

276
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,117
We know that most thefts in Dayton
amount to hours or days.

277
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,449
This was a century.

278
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,848
I don't see any more in circulation.

279
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,156
He could have capsuled the time.

280
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,860
You can't hide a hundred years
in the ghetto.

281
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,122
They can sense when a man has
a month more than he should.

282
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,461
The time left town.

283
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,078
That'll be eight and a half weeks.

284
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,843
Take a week for yourself.

285
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,682
Thanks.

286
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,592
You're not from around here, are you?

287
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,698
You do everything a little too fast.

288
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:48,894
Not everything.

289
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,205
What's that place across the street?

290
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,436
The casino.

291
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,372
Can anybody go?

292
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,040
Not dressed like that.

293
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,714
Good luck.

294
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,450
Sir, you were right.

295
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,085
If you turn back the clocks
the day of Hamilton's death,

296
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,289
and look at the time checks,

297
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,333
someone spent years crossing
four different Time Zones from Dayton...

298
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:21,734
To New Greenwich. The cameras picked up
on his suspicious behavior.

299
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,966
He's conscious of the surveillance,

300
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,804
he doesn't have a bodyguard, and he runs.

301
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,409
But if he has time, he doesn't need to run.

302
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,580
It's a hard habit to break.

303
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,977
You're looking for a match?

304
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,745
His name is Will Salas.

305
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,652
You know him?

306
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,750
No.

307
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,659
I remember his father.

308
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,766
Good evening.

309
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,837
I assume my time is as good as anyone's.

310
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,503
Indeed it is. However,
there is a voluntary donation

311
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,274
for non-members. Most give a year.

312
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,454
What's your game?

313
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,814
Poker.

314
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,120
Right this way.

315
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,019
What's the limit?

316
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,129
There is none.

317
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,046
I don't believe we've had the pleasure
of your company before, Mr...

318
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,549
Salas.

319
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:42,810
Will Salas.

320
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:47,217
Philippe Weis. You must come from time.

321
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,452
You could say I'm gambling my inheritance.

322
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,020
You don't have a guard, Mr. Salas?

323
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,396
I assumed I was amongst friends.

324
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,570
Bet you 50 years.

325
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,510
You must be young.

326
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,416
When you've been 25 for 85 years,
like I have,

327
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,756
knowing only a random act of violence
can take your life,

328
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,094
you learn to appreciate what you have.

329
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,030
And you seem to have a lot to appreciate.

330
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,765
I call.

331
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,386
Of course,
some think what we have is unfair.

332
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,719
The time difference between Zones.

333
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,393
I've heard that.

334
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,055
But isn't this just the next logical step
in our evolution?

335
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:07,067
And hasn't evolution always been unfair?

336
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,763
It's always been survival of the fittest.

337
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,405
Raise you another two centuries.

338
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,305
This is merely Darwinian capitalism.

339
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,311
Natural selection.

340
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,417
Absolutely.

341
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,816
The strong survive.

342
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,914
And I think your hand is weak.

343
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,592
I call.

344
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,176
It appears you're all in, Mr. Salas.

345
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,435
Thirteen figures.

346
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,211
Well played.

347
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,647
That was some risk.

348
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,520
It wasn't a risk.

349
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:38,157
No offense. I knew I was going to win.

350
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,729
Confusing times.

351
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,832
Is she my mother, my sister
or my daughter?

352
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,868
You're hoping she's not my wife.

353
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,505
Things used to be simpler once. So I'm told.

354
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,504
Very beautiful.

355
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,236
Daughter.

356
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,344
Though she does look
a lot like my wife. Sylvia?

357
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,652
Will Salas.

358
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,188
Congratulations, Mr. Salas.

359
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,914
You've taken years off my father's life.

360
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,427
Which is normally what you do.
Isn't that right, my darling?

361
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,021
We're having a party tomorrow night.

362
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,933
Perhaps you'll give him a chance to
win back some of those years.

363
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,364
I'd love to.

364
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,135
Carl will tell you where I am.

365
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,539
Good night, Mr. Salas.

366
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,204
Sylvia, stay with your guards.

367
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,724
Fifty-nine years.

368
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,088
Plus tax.

369
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,135
The price includes delivery.

370
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,135
Delivery?

371
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,735
To wherever you're going to display it.

372
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,576
Display it?

373
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,648
Hell, I'm going to drive it.

374
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,628
Will Salas.

375
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,941
Allow me to introduce
my mother-in-law, Clara,

376
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,943
my wife, Michele, and my daughter, Sylvia.

377
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,844
I believe you two have already met.

378
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,609
Nice to meet you all.

379
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,244
I'll come find you later

380
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,017
for our game.

381
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,283
I look forward to it.

382
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,532
Having fun, Mr. Salas?

383
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,477
Please, call me Will.

384
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,480
It's okay, Constantin.

385
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,312
Do you always have a hired hand
standing right next to you?

386
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,880
No. I usually have two.

387
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,553
That doesn't make it very easy
to get to know you.

388
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,390
I think that's the idea.

389
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,155
Your idea?

390
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,291
My father's.

391
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,493
I understand.

392
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,493
You all have a lot to lose.

393
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,829
So do you.

394
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,504
What do you do, Will?

395
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,169
I haven't quite figured that out yet.

396
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,674
Yes, why bother? What's the hurry?

397
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,086
Right. Why do today what
you can do in a century?

398
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,422
I know one thing we can do.

399
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,088
Dance with me.

400
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,696
Do you really come from time?

401
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,468
Why would you doubt that?

402
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,636
I saw you run.

403
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,138
Reminds me of people
who come from the ghetto.

404
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,309
Sometimes I envy them.

405
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,152
You don't know anything.

406
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,986
Oh, no? The clock is good for no one.

407
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,999
The poor die and the rich don't live.

408
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,736
We can all live forever as long as
we don't do anything foolish.

409
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:49,171
Doesn't that scare you? That maybe
you'll never do anything foolish?

410
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,175
Or courageous or anything worth a damn?

411
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,182
Come with me.

412
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,932
This was tonight.

413
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,702
He's only an hour ahead of us.

414
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,375
Look at that.

415
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,385
I've never seen anything like it.

416
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,190
What are you doing?

417
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,291
We don't go in.

418
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,625
You're insane.

419
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,231
You have this in your backyard.
You never go in.

420
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,071
And I'm insane?

421
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,072
Well? What are you waiting for?

422
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,479
Sylvia, come on!

423
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,744
What happened to doing something foolish?

424
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,342
I don't know you.

425
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,839
We could change that.

426
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,117
I get it.

427
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,087
You're out here, all alone,

428
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,286
with a stranger.

429
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,389
You can't be too careful.

430
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,790
Maybe you can.

431
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,460
Sylvia!

432
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,964
Sylvia!

433
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,980
I have to go back.

434
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,382
To what?

435
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,220
You should go back.

436
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,573
- Have you seen my daughter?
- I have.

437
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,032
She's with her guards.

438
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,344
Right behind you.

439
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,515
Thank God.

440
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,412
Now,

441
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,013
how about that game?

442
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,759
it's all right, everyone. What's this about?

443
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,262
I'm sorry to have to
break up the party, Mr. Weis.

444
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,105
I just need a word with your friend.

445
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,874
My friend?

446
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,443
Very well.

447
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,742
I'm Timekeeper Raymond Leon.

448
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,836
I'm Will Salas.

449
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,246
I know.

450
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,151
What are you doing in this Zone?

451
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,747
It's not illegal, is it?
To change Time Zones?

452
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,256
No, it's not illegal.

453
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,589
It's just rare.

454
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:07,761
Where did you get that?

455
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,164
I won it

456
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,503
Gambling.

457
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,104
All of it?

458
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:22,675
No.

459
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,277
A man named Henry Hamilton
gave me over a century.

460
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,626
He said he didn't need it any more.

461
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,954
He timed himself out.

462
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,633
Henry Hamilton was
worth thousands of years.

463
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,361
He could practically live forever.

464
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,932
You expect me to believe that
he was immortal and he wanted to die?

465
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,634
I don't expect you to believe it.

466
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,208
But it's the truth.

467
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,682
It was a gift.

468
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:58,714
I'm not a thief.

469
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,815
But, hey, if you guys
are looking for stolen time,

470
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,986
maybe you should arrest everyone here.

471
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,321
Oh, I see.

472
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:10,831
You're talking about justice.

473
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,729
Well, I am a Timekeeper.

474
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,833
I don't concern myself with "justice. "

475
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,503
I only concern myself
with what I can measure.

476
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,502
Seconds, minutes, hours.

477
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,074
I keep time.

478
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,410
And that time is in the wrong hands.

479
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,357
That time will be held, along with you.

480
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,255
We'll leave you two hours
for booking and processing.

481
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,871
Why are you investigating a suicide?

482
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,172
There's mass murder
in the ghetto every day.

483
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,773
That is fascinating.

484
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,175
Huh.

485
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,118
I heard another man talk like that.

486
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,549
It was over 20 years ago.

487
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,126
You're probably too young
to remember your father.

488
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,725
We'll arrange safe transport.

489
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,630
This is New Greenwich, after all.

490
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,106
Sylvia? Do as I say and go with the guards.

491
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,910
Oh, for God's sake, Father.
There's an army in this house.

492
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,312
If we can't stop one man from killing us,
we should kill ourselves.

493
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,741
Stop him!

494
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,278
Move! Get out of the way!

495
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,181
Put it down or I'll blow her head off.

496
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,954
Thanks.

497
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,725
You're going to kill us!
Please just let me out!

498
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:26,552
What are you doing?

499
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,488
Do you even know how to drive?

500
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,757
What's there to know?

501
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,378
Oh, shit.

502
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,420
Give me some time.

503
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,925
I guess you really are
from the ghetto, after all.

504
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,587
What the hell do you know about
where I'm from? Give me some time.

505
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,329
Or you're gonna kill me,
like you killed Henry Hamilton?

506
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,131
Lend me an hour.

507
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:40,726
I'm not giving you a second.

508
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,806
I should have listened to my father.

509
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,767
Please, take me home. Please.

510
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,779
- I can't do that.
- Why?

511
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,445
You're keeping me alive.

512
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,015
Keep that covered.

513
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,985
Anybody sees it, you're definitely dead.

514
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,121
Now that worked too well.

515
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,455
You guys wasted a gorgeous car.

516
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,284
Look who it is.

517
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,962
Who it was.

518
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,531
He's done in minutes.

519
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,862
He'll wake up dead. That'll be a shock.

520
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,705
Too bad. I would have preferred to
kill him more beautifully.

521
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,534
The girl's still breathing.

522
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,301
She's got a decade.

523
00:48:58,635 --> 00:48:59,978
Holy shit.

524
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,844
The man he stole from me
had more than a century.

525
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:10,052
What? We'll divide it later.

526
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,323
It's like an angel fell from the sky.

527
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,493
Fortis!

528
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,761
Leave it!

529
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,161
Fortis!

530
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,194
Look at me.

531
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,762
You okay?

532
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:52,360
No.

533
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:55,928
Why are you laughing?

534
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,462
We're not dead.

535
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,064
Yeah, we're not alive for long, either.

536
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,438
Where did my time go? I have a half hour!

537
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,970
Ah.

538
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,446
You're lucky.

539
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,616
- Minutemen.
- Does everyone in the ghetto steal?

540
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:10,946
That's rich, coming from you.

541
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,816
- Please help me, Will.
- Let me guess,

542
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,117
now you like the idea of sharing.

543
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,453
Come here.

544
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,725
Hey, don't worry. It's not the
first time I've been this broke.

545
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,730
Well, it's a first for me.

546
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,798
What are we going to do?

547
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,064
Whatever we have to.
Come on, we got to go.

548
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,461
Dispatch, wire me my per diem.

549
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,629
<i>Time transfer.</i>

550
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,105
Cutting it close again, sir.

551
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,601
Well, I'm still walking around.

552
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,775
Judging by the lack of dead bodies,

553
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,278
I have to assume they are also.

554
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:19,614
They got jacked. They couldn't have
left here with more than minutes.

555
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,948
He's back in his old neighborhood.

556
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,519
So, where do you want us to start looking?

557
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:30,360
We don't. He'll come to us.

558
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,248
Borel?

559
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,314
Borel, open up. it's Will.

560
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,655
Greta.

561
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,692
Where's Borel?

562
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,327
He's dead.

563
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,668
Dead? What?

564
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,099
You gave him a decade.

565
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,202
He drank himself to death
with nine years on his clock.

566
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,608
Jesus Christ.

567
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,082
Greta, I'm so sorry.

568
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,774
Goodbye, Will.

569
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:32,917
Will, we have minutes.

570
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,053
Try not to act like it.

571
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:35,994
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Shut up!

572
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,724
We're going to die, Will!
Do you want to die?

573
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,130
Shut up!

574
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,407
I hope those are real. Run.

575
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,312
Stop! Wait!

576
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,514
Please, wait!

577
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,149
Come back in an hour.

578
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,750
That won't be possible.

579
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,524
Here!

580
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,473
I'll give you two days for them.

581
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,041
They're diamonds.

582
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,512
You can take the 48 hours,
or you can be a pretty corpse.

583
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,279
We'll take it.

584
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,663
Don't make a sound.

585
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,064
Give me my time.

586
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,897
Let's go.

587
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,508
I guess I got my wish.

588
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,706
I did do something foolish.

589
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,348
Your name's on a lot of buildings.

590
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,011
It's my father's name.

591
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,247
How much is he worth, anyway?

592
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,855
Eons.

593
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,194
What do you think he'd pay to get you back?

594
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,692
You have no shame, do you?

595
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,033
<i>Please deposit one minute.</i>

596
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,264
Dial.

597
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:40,710
Hello.

598
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,724
Mr. Weis, please give the phone
to the Timekeeper.

599
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,556
Hello, Will. How much do you want?

600
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,460
A thousand years.

601
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,968
You'll never live to spend it.

602
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,238
Then distribute it
to the Time Lines in Dayton.

603
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,079
Do it by sunrise tomorrow
and she can go home.

604
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,046
Will...

605
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,419
I'm afraid for you, Will.

606
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,954
You keep talking like him,
you're going to die like him.

607
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,653
My father died in a fight,
trying to take a man's time.

608
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,926
Oh, no. His crime wasn't taking time.

609
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,433
<i>He was doing something
far more dangerous.</i>

610
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,171
Please don't make your father's mistake.

611
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,343
Dayton. Padre Plaza.

612
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,014
I know it.

613
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,118
A thousand years to the Time Lines.

614
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,789
A thousand years.

615
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,850
It's nothing.

616
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,959
It's for our daughter.

617
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,529
No, it's for them.

618
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:00,570
This is insane.

619
00:56:00,636 --> 00:56:02,843
They can take your time, just like that.

620
00:56:04,006 --> 00:56:05,679
Or you can take theirs.

621
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:07,510
This is insane.

622
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:10,521
Yeah, it's insane.

623
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:26,528
We should be safe here until dawn.

624
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,706
I pay by the day.
It'll take them a while to find me.

625
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:37,579
This is your place?

626
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:44,118
There's water.
It's cold, but it's something.

627
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,553
You can put on fresh clothes.

628
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:19,953
Where's your family?

629
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:23,759
My mother timed out.

630
00:57:26,922 --> 00:57:27,992
This is her dress.

631
00:57:28,257 --> 00:57:29,429
Yeah.

632
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,440
What about your father?

633
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:37,307
He died when I was a boy.

634
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:40,777
He was a fighter. Strong arm.

635
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:46,615
He wasn't the strongest,
but he knew how to win.

636
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:49,620
How do you win?

637
00:57:57,786 --> 00:57:59,129
I'll show you.

638
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:07,304
What you do is let them
have the upper hand.

639
00:58:07,629 --> 00:58:11,133
Then, he'd let his time go all the way down.

640
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:13,979
Because he knew

641
00:58:14,636 --> 00:58:16,707
that when you were
down to your last seconds

642
00:58:17,472 --> 00:58:19,315
and they think it's over,

643
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:23,153
they start watching your clock

644
00:58:26,882 --> 00:58:28,225
and forget to watch their own.

645
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:46,239
He died in a fight?

646
00:58:49,504 --> 00:58:53,748
I think he was killed
for giving away what he won.

647
00:58:53,842 --> 00:58:56,015
He wasn't just giving them time.

648
00:58:56,845 --> 00:58:58,222
He was giving them hope.

649
00:59:03,518 --> 00:59:04,997
How long have you been this old?

650
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:07,064
Twenty-five for three.

651
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:10,864
Twenty-five for two.

652
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:15,564
What was it like when your clock started?

653
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:20,813
<i>I was in the street.</i>

654
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:22,871
<i>It almost knocked me over.</i>

655
00:59:23,538 --> 00:59:26,109
<i>My year was gone in a week,
we were so in debt.</i>

656
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:29,385
After that, I lived day to day.

657
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,226
Mine was a little different.

658
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,393
It woke me.

659
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:50,737
<i>I looked in the mirror.</i>

660
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:54,236
<i>I guess everybody does.</i>

661
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:58,808
<i>That's what you're gonna look like
for the rest of your life.</i>

662
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:02,480
My dad gave me a decade to celebrate.

663
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:05,986
You must hate me.

664
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:09,585
Where I come from.

665
01:00:10,419 --> 01:00:12,922
It's nobody's fault, what they're born with.

666
01:00:34,343 --> 01:00:36,016
They open in a minute.

667
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,852
Let's see how generous your father is now.

668
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:12,385
The Timekeepers would
have never let him do it.

669
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:14,217
You don't have to say that.

670
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:18,161
How do you think my father
built all those buildings?

671
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:20,997
By giving away a thousand years?

672
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:26,670
Now what?

673
01:01:28,497 --> 01:01:29,908
You can go home.

674
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,707
There's people on the streets.

675
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:35,009
I can move without being spotted.

676
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,175
What have you got?

677
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:41,418
Eleven hours.

678
01:01:43,478 --> 01:01:45,355
How does anyone live like this?

679
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,018
You don't generally sleep in.

680
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,694
You can call for help.

681
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,838
I'll watch from here,
I'll make sure you're safe.

682
01:01:58,894 --> 01:02:00,635
You know, you could fight this.

683
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,607
I can say that running to
the ghetto was my idea.

684
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,571
My father'd believe that,
he thinks I'm reckless.

685
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:09,715
He has a lot of influence, Will.

686
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:11,273
He can get you a lawyer.

687
01:02:11,373 --> 01:02:13,182
He can make a deal with those Timekeepers.

688
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:15,755
I'm pretty sure
that Timekeeper doesn't make deals.

689
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:21,591
What are you going to do?

690
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,093
Steal?

691
01:02:25,253 --> 01:02:27,358
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

692
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:32,702
Here. Just in case.

693
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:35,332
I'll be right here.

694
01:03:06,228 --> 01:03:08,572
<i>Please deposit
one minute.</i>

695
01:03:13,735 --> 01:03:15,408
- Father?
- Sylvia?

696
01:03:15,637 --> 01:03:17,810
You couldn't spare a second, Father?

697
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:19,816
I wish I could say I'm surprised.

698
01:03:25,747 --> 01:03:26,782
Did you hear what I just said?

699
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:28,088
<i>You know I'd do anything for you.</i>

700
01:03:29,651 --> 01:03:30,755
They're coming to get you.

701
01:03:30,986 --> 01:03:32,659
<i>They know where you are.</i>

702
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:34,059
Will, look out!

703
01:03:52,774 --> 01:03:54,913
Sorry to disappoint you,
we don't keep much on us.

704
01:03:56,111 --> 01:03:58,614
To discourage thieves like you.

705
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:05,191
Think of this as a gift.

706
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:08,461
Will! Come on!

707
01:04:30,879 --> 01:04:32,881
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I wanted to scare him.

708
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:34,619
I think you did both.

709
01:04:35,317 --> 01:04:36,819
You could say thank you.

710
01:04:36,885 --> 01:04:39,229
Thank you. What have you got?

711
01:04:40,488 --> 01:04:41,899
Nine hours.

712
01:04:42,657 --> 01:04:45,661
Why did you give him time?
You should have taken it.

713
01:04:47,662 --> 01:04:50,006
Timekeepers live day to day.

714
01:04:51,566 --> 01:04:54,240
It'll be hours before the others show up.

715
01:04:54,502 --> 01:04:56,641
He could die in the ghetto.

716
01:04:56,705 --> 01:04:58,013
He still might.

717
01:04:58,506 --> 01:05:00,508
Timekeeper, what's the hurry?

718
01:05:00,742 --> 01:05:04,747
Stay a while.
You might like us if you got to know us!

719
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,119
They're going to think you're with me.

720
01:05:10,185 --> 01:05:11,596
Yes.

721
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:15,530
This is a mess.

722
01:05:15,924 --> 01:05:17,369
Welcome to my world.

723
01:05:21,363 --> 01:05:22,706
Back off!

724
01:05:24,532 --> 01:05:27,274
You've been shot.
I was worried you timed out.

725
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,113
Where'd you get that?

726
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:44,355
What are we going to do?

727
01:05:44,419 --> 01:05:46,490
We can't keep driving around in this car.

728
01:05:46,554 --> 01:05:47,760
It's a cop car.

729
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:50,530
So let's make an arrest.

730
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:12,323
Was I going too fast?

731
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:15,089
Not fast enough.

732
01:06:15,483 --> 01:06:17,622
The mistake you made was stopping.

733
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:22,091
Now, let's see who you got back there.

734
01:06:24,926 --> 01:06:27,236
Got to be a year or two nobody's using.

735
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:29,698
Whoa!

736
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,445
It went off.

737
01:06:33,768 --> 01:06:35,179
I was just trying to help.

738
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:43,449
Come on.

739
01:06:45,613 --> 01:06:49,789
Now, I'd say, "Your money or your life,"
but since your money is your life...

740
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:52,193
How dare you steal from me?

741
01:06:52,353 --> 01:06:53,855
- Don't think of it as stealing.
- No?

742
01:06:54,122 --> 01:06:56,124
Think of it as repossession.

743
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:58,535
I'll leave you with
what I've had most every day of my life.

744
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,862
- One day.
- One day?

745
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:03,100
Are you insane?

746
01:07:03,998 --> 01:07:04,999
You can do a lot in a day.

747
01:07:08,303 --> 01:07:09,646
Those are pretty.

748
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:17,449
I owe you these.

749
01:07:17,512 --> 01:07:19,150
You shouldn't have.

750
01:07:19,814 --> 01:07:21,157
You, out.

751
01:07:28,056 --> 01:07:30,900
<i>Will Salas, prime
suspect in the murder of Henry Hamilton,</i>

752
01:07:30,992 --> 01:07:33,939
<i>is believed to be traveling
with Sylvia Weis,</i>

753
01:07:33,995 --> 01:07:36,305
<i>daughter of finance magnate,
Philippe Weis.</i>

754
01:07:36,364 --> 01:07:38,640
Citizens are advised to exercise extreme...

755
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:44,012
We look cute together.

756
01:07:48,009 --> 01:07:49,852
It doesn't say you're wanted.

757
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:53,356
It doesn't say I'm not.

758
01:07:54,415 --> 01:07:56,759
You've forgotten I shot a cop.

759
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:00,090
I admit, not very well.

760
01:08:00,855 --> 01:08:02,425
It was your first time.

761
01:08:05,193 --> 01:08:06,194
Hey.

762
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:09,202
I can say I made you do all of it.

763
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:11,871
You can go back.

764
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,773
Go back to what?

765
01:08:15,436 --> 01:08:19,384
Do I really want to spend my whole life
trying not to die by mistake?

766
01:08:22,043 --> 01:08:24,785
A lot of people would say
being here is a mistake.

767
01:08:27,382 --> 01:08:29,055
I don't have a choice.

768
01:08:32,053 --> 01:08:34,090
I'm starting to think that I don't, either.

769
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:58,814
I want to reassure you all
there is no cause for alarm.

770
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,086
No ransom was paid.

771
01:09:00,415 --> 01:09:02,326
<i>Your Zone is at risk, Philippe.</i>

772
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:05,091
<i>It puts us at risk. It can spreed.</i>

773
01:09:05,253 --> 01:09:08,097
<i>Too much time in the wrong hands
can crash the market.</i>

774
01:09:08,323 --> 01:09:10,496
This hostage situation
will be quickly resolved.

775
01:09:10,558 --> 01:09:12,037
Sir.

776
01:09:14,762 --> 01:09:18,175
Everything is under control.
We'll talk soon.

777
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:27,078
Timekeeper. After this regrettable incident,

778
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:29,951
it's really not necessary
for you to come in person.

779
01:09:30,945 --> 01:09:34,620
I'm afraid it really is necessary.

780
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:39,354
When can we hope for a rescue?

781
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:41,430
I believe that's the point.

782
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:43,366
She doesn't appear to want to be rescued.

783
01:09:45,126 --> 01:09:46,628
Mr. Leon.

784
01:09:48,129 --> 01:09:50,871
Raymond. May I call you Raymond?

785
01:09:53,134 --> 01:09:54,704
I blame myself.

786
01:09:55,703 --> 01:09:57,740
I invited the man into my home.

787
01:09:57,805 --> 01:09:59,807
He had so much time,
how was I supposed to know?

788
01:10:01,643 --> 01:10:05,989
Of course, Sylvia brought this on herself
by her lack of vigilance.

789
01:10:06,547 --> 01:10:09,050
That's why I always tried to keep her close.

790
01:10:10,652 --> 01:10:13,997
But she is clearly under
Will Salas' control.

791
01:10:22,163 --> 01:10:24,040
If it's a matter of resources,

792
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:27,045
I'm happy to make a contribution.

793
01:10:28,836 --> 01:10:31,077
It's a scandal,
what we pay our Timekeepers.

794
01:10:34,842 --> 01:10:37,015
I've issued a warrant
for your daughter's arrest.

795
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,250
If she contacts you
and you assist her in any way,

796
01:10:40,348 --> 01:10:42,191
I will issue a warrant for your arrest.

797
01:10:53,528 --> 01:10:55,872
There is nothing I cannot buy.

798
01:10:58,199 --> 01:10:59,269
Now

799
01:11:01,102 --> 01:11:02,775
how many of my years do you want?

800
01:11:04,872 --> 01:11:06,874
There aren't enough years,

801
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:12,184
even in your lifetime, Mr. Weis. Good night.

802
01:11:17,385 --> 01:11:19,558
This is called a trigger.

803
01:11:20,254 --> 01:11:23,599
And you don't pull it until
you actually want to shoot something.

804
01:11:30,698 --> 01:11:31,972
I wanted to shoot something.

805
01:11:32,033 --> 01:11:33,068
Right.

806
01:11:37,605 --> 01:11:39,585
Will, if you get a lot of time,

807
01:11:41,876 --> 01:11:43,150
are you really gonna give it away?

808
01:11:44,278 --> 01:11:46,121
I've only ever had a day.

809
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:48,618
How much do you need?

810
01:11:50,051 --> 01:11:51,724
How can you live with yourself
watching people die

811
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:52,890
right next to you?

812
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:56,059
You don't watch.

813
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:58,894
You close your eyes.

814
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:10,742
I can help you get all the time you want.

815
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:20,885
I need to borrow a month.
What's the interest?

816
01:12:21,616 --> 01:12:23,391
Today's rate, 30%.

817
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:26,121
I can't pay it back.

818
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:28,560
We can always come to some arrangement.

819
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:55,487
Let's go.

820
01:12:58,086 --> 01:13:01,795
Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to
announce that Weis Timelenders

821
01:13:01,856 --> 01:13:04,803
is now offering interest-free
loans with no payments.

822
01:13:04,859 --> 01:13:05,929
Ever.

823
01:13:05,993 --> 01:13:07,495
So help yourselves and take a day.

824
01:13:07,628 --> 01:13:09,164
Take a month. Hell, take a year.

825
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:11,435
Come on. Help yourselves! Take it.

826
01:13:11,499 --> 01:13:12,978
Take the time. it's free.

827
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:50,542
No one's watching their clocks, huh?

828
01:13:51,038 --> 01:13:53,416
Get out of here,
or I'll confiscate every second!

829
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:02,589
Must've thought it was a drive-through.

830
01:14:35,516 --> 01:14:36,517
Turn around.

831
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:38,119
Don't move.

832
01:14:38,186 --> 01:14:39,790
I don't have much.

833
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:41,424
Everything I have, I give away.

834
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:42,523
I know.

835
01:15:04,712 --> 01:15:06,714
Yes, sir, I do know that, sir.

836
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:10,389
There are years that shouldn't be there.

837
01:15:14,722 --> 01:15:16,395
I will stop him, sir.

838
01:15:18,459 --> 01:15:19,631
Doesn't he understand

839
01:15:19,694 --> 01:15:22,140
he's hurting the very people
he's trying to help?

840
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:33,149
Well, now.

841
01:15:34,108 --> 01:15:36,088
- Look at all that.
- Yeah.

842
01:15:36,744 --> 01:15:38,587
I finally had time to buy one of these.

843
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:42,990
Let's not do anything I might regret.

844
01:16:16,617 --> 01:16:18,358
What was that about?

845
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,665
I wasted 30 days.

846
01:16:20,721 --> 01:16:24,328
<i>Today, Sylvia Weis
withdrew some of her "inheritance "</i>

847
01:16:24,392 --> 01:16:26,872
<i>when she and Will Salas
robbed her father's time bank</i>

848
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:29,532
<i>for the sixth time in a week.</i>

849
01:16:30,364 --> 01:16:31,365
I give her everything.

850
01:16:33,034 --> 01:16:34,638
Does she want to kill me?

851
01:16:35,202 --> 01:16:36,704
You were killing her, Philippe.

852
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:40,646
You were suffocating her.

853
01:16:42,877 --> 01:16:44,550
You suffocate us all.

854
01:16:49,317 --> 01:16:50,387
Call.

855
01:16:56,657 --> 01:16:58,000
That's good.

856
01:16:58,559 --> 01:17:01,062
Just not as good as that.

857
01:17:01,128 --> 01:17:02,129
Ooh!

858
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:05,333
You haven't forgotten how to play cards.

859
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,244
Why did I play strip poker with you?

860
01:17:08,836 --> 01:17:10,338
Why did you?

861
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:17,614
Sir.

862
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:19,590
They're still there.

863
01:17:21,248 --> 01:17:22,852
How did you know, sir?

864
01:17:23,918 --> 01:17:26,262
This is where the hours and the days are.

865
01:17:28,255 --> 01:17:30,360
He's paid them all off.

866
01:17:31,258 --> 01:17:32,703
This is where I would hide.

867
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:42,103
Put your clothes on.

868
01:17:49,076 --> 01:17:50,419
Stop!

869
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:54,056
- We're trapped!
- No, we're not!

870
01:17:55,616 --> 01:17:57,118
Jump. They won't do it.

871
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:58,288
We shouldn't do it.

872
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:06,231
Come on!

873
01:18:15,236 --> 01:18:17,307
See? They won't jump.

874
01:18:20,307 --> 01:18:21,445
So much for your theory.

875
01:18:21,509 --> 01:18:22,749
Shit!

876
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,131
Here!

877
01:18:40,594 --> 01:18:41,698
Go!

878
01:18:45,366 --> 01:18:47,539
Stop! Stop!

879
01:19:05,419 --> 01:19:06,955
I'm telling you, he'll give up before we do!

880
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:08,193
You sure about that?

881
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,033
No.

882
01:19:29,543 --> 01:19:30,886
- Go.
- I can't.

883
01:19:30,978 --> 01:19:32,389
You can! Go!

884
01:19:34,982 --> 01:19:36,120
Un-fucking-believable!

885
01:19:50,731 --> 01:19:52,005
Hold on.

886
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,277
You two look familiar.

887
01:19:57,571 --> 01:19:58,743
How about now?

888
01:20:24,932 --> 01:20:26,377
Welcome to the Century.

889
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:29,714
Hi. We're looking for a quiet place to stay.

890
01:20:30,471 --> 01:20:31,506
How many rooms?

891
01:20:32,139 --> 01:20:33,174
All of them.

892
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:35,647
We were hoping for something long-term.

893
01:20:36,377 --> 01:20:39,221
Can we rely on the discretion of your staff?

894
01:20:39,446 --> 01:20:41,448
I'm sure you can.

895
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:52,067
I'm sorry. We're fully booked.

896
01:20:54,128 --> 01:20:55,471
Right.

897
01:21:04,972 --> 01:21:06,974
Nobody goes anywhere!

898
01:21:07,274 --> 01:21:08,275
Wait, whoa, whoa.

899
01:21:10,077 --> 01:21:11,078
Don't look at me.

900
01:21:12,813 --> 01:21:14,588
You know who I'm looking for.

901
01:21:18,752 --> 01:21:23,098
I'm looking for whoever
gave this man a month!

902
01:21:25,492 --> 01:21:29,497
And I'm gonna clean the clocks off
of every one of you in this hellhole

903
01:21:29,597 --> 01:21:34,137
until someone says something
I want to hear.

904
01:21:41,675 --> 01:21:43,018
I can't hear anything.

905
01:21:47,448 --> 01:21:48,620
Clean it.

906
01:21:50,484 --> 01:21:52,862
No, wait, wait. Wait. Please!

907
01:21:54,221 --> 01:21:56,292
Please don't. Please.
I don't know where they are!

908
01:21:57,558 --> 01:21:58,662
Please.

909
01:22:00,828 --> 01:22:02,102
Please!

910
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,002
Please.

911
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,185
I believe you're next.

912
01:22:14,775 --> 01:22:15,776
Um...

913
01:22:17,244 --> 01:22:20,521
At last, someone's acting reasonably.

914
01:22:21,015 --> 01:22:22,926
I just want a share of the reward.

915
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:33,532
My young friend.

916
01:22:35,195 --> 01:22:37,197
You'll get your reward.

917
01:22:45,205 --> 01:22:46,548
Ten years.

918
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,284
That's insulting.

919
01:22:58,385 --> 01:23:00,058
If they catch us,

920
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:04,631
there's no way they won't kill us, is there?

921
01:23:07,227 --> 01:23:08,729
Do you regret this?

922
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:11,740
You saved my life.

923
01:23:14,068 --> 01:23:15,240
When?

924
01:23:17,071 --> 01:23:18,311
Now.

925
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:21,241
And every day since I met you.

926
01:23:25,913 --> 01:23:28,655
You forget, I almost got you killed
a few times, too.

927
01:23:31,085 --> 01:23:33,258
I'm willing to overlook that.

928
01:23:49,937 --> 01:23:51,610
How's the poor little rich girl?

929
01:23:52,773 --> 01:23:54,252
I never got a chance to

930
01:23:55,442 --> 01:23:57,615
properly thank you for your time.

931
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:01,281
I'm not surprised you stayed.

932
01:24:01,782 --> 01:24:04,126
It's the life, isn't it?

933
01:24:04,785 --> 01:24:07,129
Here we don't stop living

934
01:24:07,454 --> 01:24:10,298
until we're actually dead.

935
01:24:12,126 --> 01:24:13,901
There are a lot more ways
to die around here.

936
01:24:14,795 --> 01:24:17,799
But here, there's dancing before dying.

937
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:29,382
Of course, it's your friend
I'm most happy to run into again.

938
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:33,155
You've been causing a lot of trouble,
which is normally my job.

939
01:24:33,547 --> 01:24:34,753
Don't you understand?

940
01:24:35,716 --> 01:24:40,324
The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone
is 'cause I have boundaries.

941
01:24:40,387 --> 01:24:42,890
I steal from my own people.

942
01:24:43,724 --> 01:24:47,501
You surely know things are bad
when I have to restore order.

943
01:24:50,497 --> 01:24:54,673
Fortunately for you,
I don't like to kill a man in cold blood.

944
01:24:55,335 --> 01:24:56,507
I do it.

945
01:24:57,004 --> 01:25:00,679
But I prefer not to.

946
01:25:09,082 --> 01:25:11,084
I think you deserve a fighting chance.

947
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:19,766
We play to zero.

948
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:22,263
What's the point?

949
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:26,538
I lose, I die. I win, they kill me.

950
01:25:27,868 --> 01:25:31,042
If you don't fight, I'll kill you now.

951
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:32,640
And her?

952
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:35,611
After I take you,

953
01:25:36,543 --> 01:25:37,613
I'll take her.

954
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:43,725
Oh, yeah. And her time.

955
01:25:45,285 --> 01:25:46,855
Then I'll collect my reward

956
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,400
for making everything right in the world.

957
01:27:11,338 --> 01:27:12,339
This way!

958
01:27:20,347 --> 01:27:22,520
All the time he's taken.

959
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:25,125
Don't you mean the time
he's given away, sir?

960
01:27:28,188 --> 01:27:29,599
Even to you?

961
01:27:37,364 --> 01:27:42,211
I have given 50 years of
my life to this job.

962
01:27:43,036 --> 01:27:46,040
I am not about to see
those years go to waste.

963
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:49,284
Goon.

964
01:28:05,792 --> 01:28:08,568
I'm sorry to be the one
to break this to you,

965
01:28:09,463 --> 01:28:11,136
but by tomorrow

966
01:28:11,398 --> 01:28:13,139
you won't have time to stand around.

967
01:28:31,752 --> 01:28:33,425
God damn it.

968
01:28:37,257 --> 01:28:38,600
It's over.

969
01:28:38,925 --> 01:28:40,836
We lost. We're not doing any good.

970
01:28:41,161 --> 01:28:42,401
At least we're trying.

971
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:47,776
No. You don't understand. All they have to
do is keep raising the cost of living.

972
01:28:48,101 --> 01:28:51,776
A hundred years. Two. A thousand.
It does nothing.

973
01:28:52,005 --> 01:28:53,609
So, what? We just stop fighting?

974
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,582
We can't win. We can't hurt them.

975
01:28:56,643 --> 01:28:58,589
The time we're taking
makes no damn difference!

976
01:28:58,645 --> 01:29:00,784
What would? What would hurt them?

977
01:29:01,348 --> 01:29:04,955
A million years.
You got a million years on you?

978
01:29:09,122 --> 01:29:11,625
I guess it really would
take a million years.

979
01:29:15,695 --> 01:29:16,969
Let's give up.

980
01:29:43,723 --> 01:29:45,066
Stop!

981
01:29:46,726 --> 01:29:48,171
I am Sylvia Weis.

982
01:29:50,497 --> 01:29:52,170
I want to surrender,

983
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:54,471
but only to my father.

984
01:29:58,672 --> 01:30:00,208
Sylvia.

985
01:30:02,342 --> 01:30:03,821
Hello, Daddy.

986
01:30:06,646 --> 01:30:07,750
Stay where you are!

987
01:30:09,749 --> 01:30:12,025
You've hired more guards
since I last saw you.

988
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:13,427
Thanks to you, I need them.

989
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,363
One too many.

990
01:30:17,057 --> 01:30:18,297
Guns down.

991
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,032
Now!

992
01:30:21,828 --> 01:30:22,829
Do it.

993
01:30:33,373 --> 01:30:35,148
Let's go for a ride.

994
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:44,722
You'd steal from your own father.

995
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:47,554
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

996
01:31:02,235 --> 01:31:03,714
What's the combination?

997
01:31:04,804 --> 01:31:06,750
Well, it's not my birthday.

998
01:31:06,806 --> 01:31:09,980
You've started to regret that day,
I imagine, Father.

999
01:31:11,244 --> 01:31:13,918
Try 12-2-18-09.

1000
01:31:15,482 --> 01:31:17,257
Darwin's birthday.

1001
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:21,094
Survival of the fittest.

1002
01:31:23,557 --> 01:31:26,470
It cost us centuries
just to bribe our way in here.

1003
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,762
Let's see what it got us.

1004
01:31:45,779 --> 01:31:47,281
Quality time.

1005
01:31:49,115 --> 01:31:51,789
There really is a man
with a million years.

1006
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:54,695
That's my first million.
It won't be my last.

1007
01:31:54,788 --> 01:31:56,131
You know how much good it could do?

1008
01:31:56,189 --> 01:31:58,135
I know how much harm it could do.

1009
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:01,001
Try to understand,
even if you gave a year to a million people,

1010
01:32:01,061 --> 01:32:02,472
you're just prolonging their agony.

1011
01:32:02,529 --> 01:32:04,475
You're prolonging their lives.

1012
01:32:04,965 --> 01:32:08,970
Flooding the wrong Zone with a million
years, it could cripple the system.

1013
01:32:09,035 --> 01:32:10,378
Let's hope so.

1014
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:14,646
We're not meant to live like this.
We're not meant to live forever.

1015
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:19,786
Although I do wonder, Father,
if you've ever lived a day in your life.

1016
01:32:20,313 --> 01:32:24,659
Is that so? You might upset
the balance for a generation.

1017
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:26,323
Two.

1018
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,324
But don't fool yourself.
In the end, nothing will change.

1019
01:32:31,157 --> 01:32:33,159
Because everyone wants to live forever.

1020
01:32:34,561 --> 01:32:37,474
They all think they have
a chance at immortality

1021
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:38,873
even though all the evidence is against it.

1022
01:32:41,001 --> 01:32:43,106
They all think they will be the exception.

1023
01:32:43,169 --> 01:32:45,672
But the truth is,

1024
01:32:46,006 --> 01:32:48,145
for a few to be immortal, many must die.

1025
01:33:04,524 --> 01:33:07,368
No one should be immortal

1026
01:33:08,194 --> 01:33:10,435
if even one person has to die.

1027
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:26,622
What was that?

1028
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,883
What was that? What just happened?

1029
01:33:31,951 --> 01:33:34,955
It must be a mistake. A million years
just went off the clock in New Greenwich.

1030
01:33:35,055 --> 01:33:36,295
It's not a mistake.

1031
01:33:36,556 --> 01:33:37,557
It's gotta be a mistake, sir.

1032
01:33:37,624 --> 01:33:38,796
It's not a mistake.

1033
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:41,597
It's them.

1034
01:33:46,566 --> 01:33:47,636
Take a month, Maurice.

1035
01:34:04,317 --> 01:34:06,354
Dispatch, what can you see?

1036
01:34:06,419 --> 01:34:08,057
<i>There's a lot of traffic
in the vicinity, sir.</i>

1037
01:34:08,121 --> 01:34:10,362
All right, look for the slowest car.

1038
01:34:11,491 --> 01:34:15,940
You have a million years.
You are definitely not in a hurry.

1039
01:34:18,598 --> 01:34:20,271
If this works...

1040
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,776
If this works, we gotta get more.

1041
01:34:23,169 --> 01:34:25,843
Dayton's not the only zone that
can use a few extra years.

1042
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,610
And wire me my per diem.

1043
01:34:30,677 --> 01:34:32,179
Wait. Never mind.

1044
01:34:32,278 --> 01:34:33,621
I have him.

1045
01:34:41,287 --> 01:34:43,289
Give the order, shoot on sight.

1046
01:34:43,356 --> 01:34:45,529
<i>In New Greenwich?
That's against policy, sir.</i>

1047
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:47,866
So is having a million years leave the Zone.

1048
01:35:05,678 --> 01:35:08,022
That time cannot leave the Zone!
Shoot on sight!

1049
01:35:32,972 --> 01:35:36,476
<i>Please deposit
one month. Please deposit one month.</i>

1050
01:35:49,088 --> 01:35:50,726
Keep going! Keep going!

1051
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:51,860
We're close!

1052
01:35:52,425 --> 01:35:53,768
We're okay! We're okay!

1053
01:36:08,274 --> 01:36:09,309
You're late.

1054
01:36:11,711 --> 01:36:12,815
Need a minute?

1055
01:36:15,548 --> 01:36:16,959
Go. Go.

1056
01:36:18,218 --> 01:36:19,822
Where's our capsule?

1057
01:36:20,253 --> 01:36:21,391
Too late.

1058
01:36:26,893 --> 01:36:28,497
Lost a lot of time, Mr. Leon.

1059
01:36:28,895 --> 01:36:30,738
Looks like you're about out yourself.

1060
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,406
- Time!
- There's time!

1061
01:36:35,468 --> 01:36:36,503
Move!

1062
01:36:53,586 --> 01:36:54,929
Move!

1063
01:36:58,925 --> 01:37:01,428
You, get out! Get out!

1064
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:19,453
We gotta get to Livingston.

1065
01:37:21,281 --> 01:37:22,589
We can make it.

1066
01:37:22,649 --> 01:37:23,787
Can we?

1067
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:33,464
You okay?

1068
01:38:00,219 --> 01:38:01,562
Stop!

1069
01:38:08,328 --> 01:38:09,466
You can run.

1070
01:38:11,564 --> 01:38:12,975
So can you.

1071
01:38:15,668 --> 01:38:17,477
You're from here, aren't you?

1072
01:38:20,006 --> 01:38:21,542
Long time ago.

1073
01:38:22,108 --> 01:38:23,109
Yeah.

1074
01:38:23,576 --> 01:38:25,487
I worked out how to escape.

1075
01:38:25,745 --> 01:38:28,089
And now you make sure no one else does.

1076
01:38:28,147 --> 01:38:29,683
That's the way it has to be.

1077
01:38:31,517 --> 01:38:33,360
I didn't start the clock.

1078
01:38:34,854 --> 01:38:36,492
I can't turn it back.

1079
01:38:38,024 --> 01:38:39,367
I keep it running.

1080
01:38:40,193 --> 01:38:41,501
I keep time.

1081
01:38:42,695 --> 01:38:44,368
"I keep time. "

1082
01:38:48,701 --> 01:38:51,341
I'm gonna need some of that time
you borrowed from me.

1083
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,112
Unless you want us to die
on the way to our execution.

1084
01:39:01,714 --> 01:39:03,057
Time.

1085
01:39:25,304 --> 01:39:26,806
We don't have enough.

1086
01:39:30,243 --> 01:39:32,314
One of us can make it. Take mine.

1087
01:39:32,578 --> 01:39:35,559
You take mine. You can get there, I can't!
I can't get there. You can.

1088
01:39:35,615 --> 01:39:37,891
- No. No.
- Yes!

1089
01:39:39,419 --> 01:39:40,591
Please.

1090
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,092
No.

1091
01:39:51,764 --> 01:39:53,107
There's time.

1092
01:39:53,533 --> 01:39:55,979
- What?
- The Keeper's time. Run. Run!

1093
01:40:06,012 --> 01:40:07,355
Run!

1094
01:40:21,127 --> 01:40:22,128
I need time.

1095
01:40:22,195 --> 01:40:23,970
<i>Time transfer.</i>

1096
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:48,963
What have we got?

1097
01:40:50,123 --> 01:40:51,397
A day.

1098
01:40:52,191 --> 01:40:53,534
Could do a lot in a day.

1099
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:11,317
Sir, do something.

1100
01:41:13,146 --> 01:41:14,819
It's already done.

1101
01:41:15,681 --> 01:41:17,888
<i>These are
live pictures from Dayton.</i>

1102
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:20,089
<i>Citizens have taken to the streets.</i>

1103
01:41:20,186 --> 01:41:22,689
<i>There's so much stolen time in circulation.</i>

1104
01:41:23,022 --> 01:41:24,831
<i>Fa stories in Dayton lie idle.</i>

1105
01:41:25,057 --> 01:41:27,196
<i>And now, citizens are crossing Zones,</i>

1106
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:28,739
<i>seen here entering New Greenwich.</i>

1107
01:41:29,362 --> 01:41:31,865
<i>While authorities claim
they have the situation</i>

1108
01:41:31,931 --> 01:41:36,209
<i>under control, others fear the system
may be headed for collapse.</i>

1109
01:41:36,269 --> 01:41:39,307
<i>We will continue to update you
on this developing story.</i>

1110
01:41:39,705 --> 01:41:41,412
Sir, we lost Zone Eight.

1111
01:41:41,474 --> 01:41:42,509
And Ten.

1112
01:41:46,846 --> 01:41:48,416
It's spreading.

1113
01:41:50,082 --> 01:41:51,322
What do we do, sir?

1114
01:41:52,852 --> 01:41:54,195
Go home.

1115
01:42:02,695 --> 01:42:06,973
<i>Still no sign of
fugitives Will Salas and Sylvia Weis.</i>

1116
01:42:07,066 --> 01:42:09,637
<i>Authorities continue to ask
for the public '5 help</i>

1117
01:42:09,702 --> 01:42:12,740
<i>in bringing these criminals to justice.</i>

1118
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:33,464
Told you there were bigger banks.

1119
01:42:35,394 --> 01:42:36,737
You almost missed your calling.
