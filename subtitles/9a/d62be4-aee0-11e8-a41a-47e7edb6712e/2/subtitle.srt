1
00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:05,448
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you"

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,952
Really?
Is that what it says?

3
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:09,487
Gee!

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,786
Oh my gosh
Sang-min must really like me a lot

5
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:15,893
You have to give it
to me tomorrow, okay?

6
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:16,951
Okay

7
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:24,731
I have no reason to see him anymore

8
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:28,264
He wants to be with Soo-gyung now

9
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:31,368
When the sun shines on the sea...

10
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:34,611
When the dim moonlight is on the spring...

11
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:43,277
Are you done?

12
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,622
Wait a little longer

13
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,128
Hand in your manure

14
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:54,664
in an envelope after lunch

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,834
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

16
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:59,537
Those who didn't bring it hurry and go take a shit!

17
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,437
Got it?

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,743
Let's get together!

19
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:24,722
One! Two!

20
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,157
One! Two!

21
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:27,458
One! Two!

22
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,288
Joon-ha

23
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:32,920
I'll close my eyes and run so you guide me, okay?

24
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:34,231
I'm really closing them

25
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,664
Okay

26
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:37,161
Joon-ha

27
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:41,829
Wanna come with me to learn the folk dance after class?

28
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:43,607
folk?

29
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:45,541
I'm gonna meet Joo-hee there

30
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:48,879
It's my dad and his friend's idea

31
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,515
They want us to meet at a healthy recreation

32
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:54,541
A lot of girls will be there
so you pick one up

33
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,052
- Gonna come, right?
- I don't know

34
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,284
Tae-soo!

35
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:20,769
Joo-hee, this is my friend Oh Joon-ha

36
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:23,379
She's the one I told you about

37
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:28,643
I'm Oh Joon-ha
Nice to meet you

38
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:35,086
Hello
Are you two friends?

39
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:38,695
Know each other?

40
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:41,296
No, we don't

41
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:47,259
He's my best friend

42
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:56,310
This is my friend, Na-hee

43
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:59,948
Hi, I'm Na Na-hee

44
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,453
- I'm YOON Tae-soo
- I'm Oh Joon-ha

45
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:04,455
Everyone please have a seat

46
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:06,116
Come on!

47
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:08,584
Anywhere is fine

48
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:29,280
Today I will teach you the folk dance

49
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,373
- Sounds fun, right?
- Yes

50
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:34,474
Folk Dance is...

51
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:36,679
I missed you

52
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:46,052
Me, too

53
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:33,334
I didn't know you were Tae-soo's friend

54
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,431
I want to be a woman anchor

55
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,470
So I always practice my speech

56
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:16,111
Can you do this?

57
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:20,306
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

58
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:23,944
Did I do okay?
I can do it faster

59
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:27,417
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

60
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,190
Shall I do it faster?

61
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:32,660
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

62
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,856
Give it a try

63
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:41,999
Peter Piper a pecked
of peppers pickled...

64
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:47,544
You'll need a lot of practice
Repeat precisely after me

65
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:53,949
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

66
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,380
We should split up now

67
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:05,526
I'll take Joo-hee home
so you take care of Na-hee

68
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:08,790
Okay?
See you later

69
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:13,093
I had fun
Good night

70
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,194
Bye, Joo-hee

71
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,363
Good night

72
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:43,828
What are you doing?
Let's get going

73
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:49,905
Joon-ha

74
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:53,767
then try something easier

75
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,272
Try this

76
00:08:55,512 --> 00:09:00,779
She sells seashells by the seashore

77
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:04,615
Easy, huh?
Give it a try

78
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:05,889
Pardon?

79
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,789
I said give it a try

80
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:10,587
Give what a try?

81
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:15,833
She sells seashells by the seashore

82
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,267
Give this a try

83
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,896
I can't
Please don't ask me to

84
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:23,563
You can't do this?

85
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:28,946
She sells seashells by the seashore

86
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:30,314
It's easy

87
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:35,946
She sells seashells by the seashore

88
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,700
- Have a good...
- Yes...

89
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,634
Good-bye

90
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:00,729
The card

91
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,401
I should've known there'd be a card for me

92
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:44,730
Ji-hae?

93
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,739
Oh, hello

94
00:12:57,187 --> 00:12:58,814
Where are you headed?

95
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:02,614
To the library

96
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:04,325
That far?

97
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:07,129
It's not far

98
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:11,596
I won't get so wet if I stop at each building

99
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,140
Then I'll take you there

100
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:25,108
With my special umbrella

101
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:32,183
Think of that building as a shed and run

102
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:36,023
One, Two, Three!

103
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:25,666
How are you?

104
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,771
Thanks so much

105
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:37,207
But you're soaked

106
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,644
I was going to get wet anyway

107
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:49,960
I should be going
Thanks again

108
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,428
- Okay, I'll see you later
- OK!

109
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:18,476
I didn't think we'd meet again

110
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:21,452
But why does the library have to be so close?

111
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:49,009
She hasn't mailed me back yet

112
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:54,415
- Joo-hee?
- Yeah

113
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:58,961
- Why not?
- I don't know

114
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:04,031
I'm not the type to fall in love with one girl

115
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,733
But I must really like her

116
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:10,769
Tae-soo!

117
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:11,805
Tae-soo!

118
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,947
Tae-soo?

119
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:24,744
Hi

120
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:28,456
What are you doing here?

121
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:31,555
I was waiting for you

122
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:35,696
Please take these flowers

123
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:43,071
I like you, Joo-hee

124
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:53,238
Please write to me

125
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:05,489
It's so strange
Is it because I'm too tall?

126
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:07,692
Why do I keep fainting?

127
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,804
I'm out of breath

128
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,844
It's because of Tae-soo, right?

129
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,118
What do you think I should do?

130
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:11,218
Tell me

131
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,798
Tae-soo is a rotten bastard

132
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,298
No, Tae-soo is nice

133
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:27,474
He's a rotten bastard because he's too nice

134
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:34,681
Tae-soo is waiting for your letter

135
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:43,815
There's no hope

136
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:47,990
There's nothing we can do for us

137
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:53,299
Don't say that

138
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,267
There's a way

139
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:05,537
No, there's nothing more we can do

140
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,440
Nothing

141
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:11,817
We'll only get hurt

142
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:26,394
It'll work out

143
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:38,103
I won't see neither you nor Tae-soo anymore

144
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:40,939
I'm serious

145
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:44,747
I won't see anyone

146
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,677
Hey, limousine boy!

147
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:14,480
Come here

148
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:19,113
Limousine boy!
Forgot to bow?

149
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:24,553
So you don't wanna bow
is that it?

150
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,321
If you have a chauffeur you don't have to bow, huh?

151
00:21:31,734 --> 00:21:36,034
Your badge is upside down and your shirt's unbuttoned

152
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:40,604
Fine, today I'll give you the worst beating ever

153
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,377
I'm gonna beat you all starting from the left

154
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:56,013
The first one gets hit once the second one gets hit twice

155
00:21:56,459 --> 00:22:00,129
From the third shout out your turn

156
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,031
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

157
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:05,592
- You sissies, I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

158
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:07,562
Seven

159
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:12,997
Stay still!

160
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:23,209
- Ouch, my back
- Stay still, or I'll break your arm

161
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,859
You get one more beating
Get into position!

162
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,958
Listen to what I said and get into position!

163
00:22:46,642 --> 00:22:48,405
What's the count?

164
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,402
I said what's the count?

165
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:55,908
Then I'll tell you
You're nineteen

166
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,319
One

167
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:01,851
Two

168
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:05,349
Three!

169
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:10,688
Hey, get up!
Get up!

170
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,140
Hey, Hey!
What's wrong with you?

171
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,404
It's about Joo-hee

172
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:25,312
I don't think she likes me

173
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,778
I gave her flowers and even kissed her

174
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,819
but there's no response

175
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,952
You kissed her?

176
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,223
Yeah

177
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:48,062
When the sun shines on the sea
I think of you

178
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:52,463
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you

179
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:39,862
Take this and go home
Stay out of the rain

180
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:14,626
Dummy

181
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,334
Do you want to get electrocuted?

182
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:19,266
You're crazy

183
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:22,164
I don't want to split up like this

184
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:24,732
Let's talk just for a moment

185
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,141
Nothing can change

186
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:30,441
There's no use in talking
Let go of me!

187
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,869
Here's your letter

188
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:33,808
I don't want it anymore

189
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:35,338
Why?

190
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:39,381
There's no response and because of my conscience

191
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:42,119
I'll write it myself from now on

192
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:44,615
And tell her the truth

193
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,757
It's a golden opportunity

194
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:53,022
I heard she's very sick from the rain

195
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:56,691
So she's in the hospital

196
00:27:56,969 --> 00:28:00,539
She's very sick?
Because of the rain?

197
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,131
Yeah

198
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:05,268
I'm going to see her

199
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:09,670
If I visit her when she's sick then I can score

200
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:15,486
I'll confess to her that I didn't write the letters

201
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,388
I won't tell her it was you

202
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:23,226
Actually
I'm not the type to like one girl

203
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:27,430
but I really like her

204
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:29,599
Oh Joon-ha!

205
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:31,798
Oh Joon-ha!

206
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:33,504
He's calling you

207
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:34,706
Yes?

208
00:28:34,706 --> 00:28:39,871
Twenty four, twenty seven
Thirty, thirty two...

209
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,048
I have to eat all this?

210
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:44,516
Look at this

211
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:48,353
Mawworms, intestinal worms
hookworms, roundworms...

212
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:51,652
You have everything
What the hell did you eat?

213
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,691
Because of you our class has the most parasites

214
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:57,195
But sir it wasn't my manure

215
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,890
Then whose was it?

216
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:04,066
You're the only one who'd have
this many parasites, Eat it now!

217
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,785
YOON Tae-soo

218
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:27,515
Eat three

219
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:30,228
But it's the same manure

220
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:34,995
Yeah, but some spots have more parasites and some don't

221
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:57,317
How'd you know I was here?

222
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,457
Why are you covering your face?

223
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:03,428
Stop it, I haven't washed my face, and it's dirty

224
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,055
But you're still pretty

225
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:08,391
- How'd you know I was here?
- I heard from Tae-soo

226
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:12,466
Why are you laughing?

227
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:17,771
I heard you ate 32 worm-killing pills

228
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,412
Tae-soo, that bastard has a big mouth

229
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:26,579
Did he say anything else?

230
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:41,058
After being silent for a while that's all he said and left

231
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,527
- Really?
- Yeah

232
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,233
He's so odd

233
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:52,566
- Are you very sick?
- Yeah

234
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:56,780
I'm sorry

235
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:01,316
I must be really stupid

236
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:07,023
Besides liking you
I'm not good at anything else

237
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:13,287
No, there's a lot you're good at

238
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:16,595
Like getting drenched and eating worm pills

239
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:21,731
Don't laugh
This is serious

240
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:27,607
I have to tell Tae-soo about us

241
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,412
Then we can clear our conscience

242
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,089
See you later

243
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:38,818
Is this her room?

244
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:48,527
My poor daughter-in-law!
How'd you get so drenched?

245
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:51,367
No, lie down

246
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:57,609
A cold can't be taken lightly
You can catch pneumonia

247
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:00,145
So, are you eating well?

248
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:04,844
You should eat well to recover

249
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:12,289
I'm sorry
This must be the wrong room

250
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,403
Wrong room

251
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:48,117
Clench your fists

252
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,221
Raise them like this

253
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:01,672
Now hit me

254
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:02,841
Why should I hit you?

255
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,138
Hurry and hit me!

256
00:33:04,476 --> 00:33:08,674
I don't like hitting people or getting hit

257
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,382
My dad hit me too many times

258
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:12,043
I like Joo-hee

259
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:17,744
Actually, she gave me this necklace last summer

260
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:22,289
Are you okay?

261
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:27,289
Damn it
I've fallen again

262
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,829
Don't worry

263
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:36,702
And don't let my dad see that necklace

264
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:38,773
He'll get furious

265
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:45,144
That necklace was a gift from my dad

266
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,114
To Joo-hee

267
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:57,584
Oh Joon-ha!
It's your letter!

268
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,427
Later on, we went on school break

269
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:06,838
And I thought I couldn't see her again

270
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,738
I miss you

271
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,168
I miss you so much I'll die

272
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:17,378
And I'm curious how much our river has changed

273
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:24,478
Say hi to our haunted house
the shed, and our row boat

274
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:29,083
Say that I miss them and that I'm doing okay

275
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:34,992
Yesterday, Tae-soo came to me with your Uncle's address

276
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,033
He also confessed a shocking thing to me

277
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:45,399
That you were the one who wrote the letters to me

278
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,942
How could you hide that from me?

279
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,910
Anyway, it's okay

280
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:58,156
I almost threw away those letters

281
00:34:58,156 --> 00:35:01,387
but now I can read them again and think of you

282
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:06,293
Tae-soo also made a suggestion

283
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:11,697
That you put Tae-soo's name on the letters you send me

284
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:17,399
Then my parents will think
that I'm exchanging letters with him

285
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:21,945
Look outside the window

286
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:24,945
If the branches swing gently in the wind

287
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:29,713
then the one you love is loving you, too

288
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:34,890
Right now it's snowing outside

289
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,227
When it first snows

290
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:40,596
they say you should stroll with your beloved

291
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:43,460
But I'm just writing a letter

292
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:47,093
Joon-ha, I miss you so much

293
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:51,298
I'm going to get permission to go to Grandpa's house

294
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:55,577
If I do
I'll send you a telegraph

295
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:57,614
Open your ears

296
00:35:57,749 --> 00:36:00,013
If you hear your heartbeat

297
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:04,712
then the person you love is loving you, too

298
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,681
Close your eyes

299
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,223
If there's a smile on your lips

300
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:14,061
then the person you love is loving you, too

301
00:36:35,787 --> 00:36:39,086
I want to send a telegraph

302
00:36:40,558 --> 00:36:42,527
Then please sign up here

303
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:43,926
Okay

304
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:57,370
But fate must not be on my side

305
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:59,673
One of my letters

306
00:36:59,944 --> 00:37:02,580
was returned back to Tae-soo's home

307
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,607
Joo-hee is in love with Joon-ha

308
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:13,685
I'm not in love with Joo-hee

309
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:21,056
Both of them really love each other

310
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,096
So that's why I gave up

311
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:30,664
Two people in love should be together

312
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:35,778
It's okay with me

313
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:39,941
No, I love her, too

314
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,682
I won't give up

315
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:50,828
Are you mocking me?
You always want things your way!

316
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:58,367
So your parents mean nothing to you?

317
00:37:58,436 --> 00:38:03,237
Do you know who she is?
She's a congressman's daughter!

318
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:11,476
Know what that means, you punk?

319
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,347
You deserve to die

320
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:16,119
You can't even hold on to a girl

321
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:36,199
It was the end of a winter break?

322
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:39,036
I had hoped so much for

323
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,902
Know what this is?

324
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:08,573
A belt?

325
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:12,065
No, it's a whip

326
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,707
This bastard hits me

327
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:20,383
My dad doesn't want it to
but it keeps wanting to hit me

328
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:29,457
That's why I caught it
How should I punish it?

329
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:31,826
The death penalty

330
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:37,066
That's exactly what I thought

331
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:46,471
Kill it slowly and painfully?

332
00:39:47,812 --> 00:39:53,648
Or starve it slowly to death?

333
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:57,722
Or give it sleeping pills?

334
00:39:57,722 --> 00:39:59,622
Strangle it to death

335
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,855
Good idea

336
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,666
Joon-ha

337
00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:18,773
Take good care of Joo-hee

338
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:39,851
Tae-soo!

339
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:45,022
Somebody help!

340
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:48,329
A person's dying!

341
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:49,734
Tae-soo, you bastard!

342
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:52,003
Tae-soo, you bastard!

343
00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:54,706
Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on!

344
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:59,877
Someone help me!
Somebody's dying!

345
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:03,711
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

346
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:11,149
I told you to kill the belt
not yourself

347
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:16,857
Tae-soo, wake up!
Open your eyes!

348
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:25,166
Don't die. Don't die
Don't die, you bastard!

349
00:42:25,236 --> 00:42:28,673
Breathe! Breathe!

350
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:33,406
Breathe, you bastard!

351
00:43:24,695 --> 00:43:27,027
Go inside

352
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:43,610
If you're with him
he'll wake up faster

353
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:51,217
Hurry

354
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:06,436
Wait here for me

355
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:38,195
Hurry and get well
