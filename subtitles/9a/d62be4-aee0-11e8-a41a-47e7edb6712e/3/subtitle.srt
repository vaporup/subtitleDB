1
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,132
Ji-hae, know what this is?

2
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:39,705
An umbrella?

3
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:42,181
A very special umbrella

4
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,309
They're all the same

5
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:51,255
It's special because Sang-min gave it to me

6
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:55,895
He must know that I like him

7
00:00:55,895 --> 00:01:00,889
Thought he wouldn't
when you stare at him everyday?

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,270
Go give this to Sang-min

9
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,007
No, you give it to him
I'm not going there

10
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,565
Why not?

11
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,541
Did you and Soo-gyung fight?

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,012
Remember when it suddenly rained that day?

13
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:23,219
Sang-min was drinking coffee here

14
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:28,050
He was looking out of the window

15
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:32,860
then suddenly turned to me and said

16
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:39,000
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

17
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:44,241
And then I said
"I was worried I didn't"

18
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:50,346
He placed his umbrella here

19
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,579
and said
"You can have it"

20
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,851
He said he was okay to get wet

21
00:01:58,057 --> 00:02:01,925
And then he ran off in the rain

22
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,862
Did you bring an umbrella?

23
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:21,512
You can have it.

24
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:31,290
It's raining a lot outside

25
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,989
Sang-min might be getting soaked without an umbrella

26
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:57,380
This is a really special umbrella

27
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:02,553
I'll give it back to him

28
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:12,455
Did you bring an umbrella?

29
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:14,266
Of course, I did

30
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,699
Really?

31
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:18,997
But still, take mine

32
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:25,900
Is she crazy?

33
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:48,584
You have an umbrella
but why are you so soaked?

34
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:53,389
It's not mine

35
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:56,066
I came to return it to you

36
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:59,431
You left it at the store

37
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:08,637
I'm not the only one
who gets wet even with an umbrella, am I?

38
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,451
Don't go

39
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:30,164
You already know...

40
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,796
my feelings

41
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:38,706
Now, you know it all

42
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,177
Yeah

43
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:51,384
when I saw you run without an umbrella

44
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,827
I left my umbrella behind

45
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,426
Even on the day of the play

46
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,865
I wanted to give you a present
so I bought Soo-gyung's, too

47
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,043
And if fate was on my side

48
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:21,085
I thought you'd pick the gift with the card in it

49
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:25,852
I thought we'd grow distant

50
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,587
if I confessed my feelings

51
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:34,394
I wanted to say that I liked you,
but I couldn't

52
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:38,936
I'll come see the play

53
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:52,811
Look
I cut my wrists

54
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,116
I saw it all
Both of you whispering love

55
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,791
Do you really love her?

56
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:03,929
Is it really so?

57
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:06,124
I'm working out my feelings

58
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:09,963
My eyes were looking straight

59
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,126
but my heart was confused

60
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:15,365
Can I trust those words?

61
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:19,403
Can I think of it as a promise?

62
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:22,271
Yes

63
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,782
There's only one that I love

64
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:30,589
That one is me, right?

65
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,181
Yes, I love you

66
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,259
I swear that I love you

67
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,829
I love you, too

68
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,831
Sang-min
I love you so much

69
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,264
Sang-min!

70
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,880
What the hell are you doing?

71
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:06,352
I didn't even finish my lines
and then you call out my name?

72
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:08,160
You can't just change your lines like that

73
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,761
You ruined everything!

74
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:13,365
Sang-min, I wasn't acting
it was my true feelings

75
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,300
I love you
Love is more important than a play

76
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,460
I love you

77
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,365
After the play Sang-min and I went on a date

78
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,661
We decided to go to the river

79
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,139
where my mother's memories lay

80
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,943
Joo-hee?

81
00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:13,458
No, I'm her daughter
My name is Ji-hae

82
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,323
Is that so?

83
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:17,718
I must've made a mistake

84
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,156
But you look so much like your mom

85
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:26,939
I delivered a lot of your mom's letters

86
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,236
Thank you, sir

87
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:54,527
I know well what happened to my parents afterwards

88
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,704
Students and citizens!

89
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:05,941
This is illegal demonstrations!

90
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:09,881
Eliminate corruption and establish a new state!
A new state!

91
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:11,850
Down with dictatorship and the military regime!

92
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,444
Down with the regime!
Down with dictatorship!

93
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:56,821
If you wipe on toothpaste
your eyes will hurt less

94
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:02,626
- Joo-hee?
- Tae-soo?

95
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,627
Put on toothpaste

96
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:41,233
It's been a long time

97
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:45,072
It has

98
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:54,474
Have you heard from Joon-ha?

99
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,365
Joon-ha!

100
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,168
Joon-ha!

101
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,006
Joon-ha!

102
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,418
Joon-ha!

103
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,614
Joon-ha!

104
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:43,455
Joon-ha!

105
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:52,893
Joon-ha
come back alive!

106
00:13:54,773 --> 00:14:01,178
Joon-ah!
You have to come back alive!

107
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,407
Joon-ha!

108
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:08,415
Joon-ha
answer me!

109
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:10,382
Joon-ha!

110
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:21,861
Joon-ha...
come back alive!

111
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:29,101
Joon-ha
come back alive!

112
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:33,203
Joon-ha!

113
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,311
Joon-ha!

114
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:46,989
Joon-ha!

115
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,025
Joon-ha!

116
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:52,094
Joon-ha!

117
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,260
Joon-ha!

118
00:14:58,403 --> 00:14:59,597
Joon-ha!

119
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:02,903
Joo-hee!

120
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,944
- Joon-ha!
- Joo-hee!

121
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:15,921
- Joo-hee!
- Joon-ha!

122
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:16,979
Tae-soo!

123
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:18,519
Joon-ha!

124
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,388
Joon-ha!

125
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:27,831
Joon-ha!

126
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,206
You have to come back alive!

127
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:36,798
Joon-ha!

128
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,939
Joon-ha
come back alive!

129
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:44,609
You have to come back alive!

130
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:47,678
Got it?

131
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:47,130
Medic! Medic!

132
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,970
Hold on! Hold on!
Breathe! Breathe!

133
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:54,076
Stop it!

134
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:56,943
He's dead! Retreat!
Get moving, you bastard!

135
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,678
Joon-ha, you bastard!

136
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:05,983
Where are you going?

137
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:09,443
Come back!
Corporal OH!

138
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:23,631
You haven't changed at all

139
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,099
Just like in the past

140
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,367
you're still pretty

141
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:38,012
I've aged a lot

142
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:54,826
- You had it hard, huh?
- Not really

143
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:06,169
How's Tae-soo doing?

144
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,881
I guess he's doing alright

145
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:26,328
Why didn't you get married?

146
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:35,533
Well, I did

147
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:47,214
I heard

148
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,557
I had so much to tell you

149
00:24:55,729 --> 00:25:01,258
But now that we've met
I can't remember

150
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:19,208
It's a piano doll

151
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,015
We have one at my home, too

152
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:30,063
When I look at it
it reminds me of you playing the piano

153
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:40,500
It looks so much like you back then

154
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,636
Doesn't it?

155
00:25:54,922 --> 00:26:01,987
We were so innocent back then

156
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:05,054
But the past has gone now

157
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:11,572
I think our feelings took the best of us

158
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:17,033
We cried and laughed at the smallest things

159
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:50,009
How do I look right now?

160
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,776
You look healthy

161
00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:03,183
But I'd like to see you look happier

162
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:14,700
I'm crying right now
Can't you see my tears?

163
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,644
Why did you hide that you couldn't see?

164
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,157
It's late

165
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,955
Sorry, I have an appointment

166
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,223
I have to go

167
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,047
I'm sorry

168
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:45,318
It was almost perfect
I could've succeeded

169
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:51,327
I even came here last night to practice

170
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,559
You almost fooled me

171
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:04,209
You did a good job
I nearly believed you

172
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:07,407
Also...

173
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:17,449
I risked my life to return this necklace to you

174
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,791
Please don't

175
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:33,932
This necklace is yours

176
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,838
Afterwards, mom and dad got married
And I was born three years later

177
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:46,504
Then a few years later...

178
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:26,152
Mrs. Sung Joo-hee?

179
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,929
Joon-ha's last wish

180
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:47,466
was for you to spread his dust in this river

181
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:53,745
Actually

182
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:56,649
Joon-ha

183
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:03,354
got married right after you did

184
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,598
Poor guy had a son, too

185
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:41,156
And Joon-ha

186
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:45,023
wanted you to have this

187
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:47,124
Mommy, it's a rainbow

188
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:00,469
I still remember clearly the rainbow I saw that day

189
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,068
Until I finished telling this story

190
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,253
Open your hands
