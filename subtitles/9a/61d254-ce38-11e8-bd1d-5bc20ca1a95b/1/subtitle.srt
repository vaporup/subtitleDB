1
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,965
Wilee.

2
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:50,282
Shit.

3
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:57,357
I can't work in an office.

4
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,324
I don't Iike wearing suits.

5
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:00,522
I Iike to ride.

6
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,197
Fixed gear, steel frame, no brakes.

7
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,039
The bike cannot coast.

8
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,357
The pedals never stop turning.

9
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:08,842
Can't stop.

10
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:10,556
Don't want to either.

11
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:15,167
There are 1,500 bike messengers
on the street in New York City.

12
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:18,201
You can e-mail it, FedEx it, fax it, scan it,

13
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:20,084
but when none of that shit works

14
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:23,239
and this thing has to be
at that place by this time,

15
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:24,760
you need us.

16
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:30,241
Some of us get killed out here.

17
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:31,601
Pedestrians are a menace.

18
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:34,316
Cabs are killers.

19
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:37,716
One time or another we all get hit.

20
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,843
Sometimes we gotta hit back.

21
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,959
If you're not gonna use it,

22
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:45,202
l guess you don't need it.

23
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:46,276
My mirror!

24
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:54,762
And we stick together,'cause most people
just wish we'd get off the street.

25
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,998
"Go get a haircut. Take a shower.
Get out of the way. "

26
00:02:58,367 --> 00:02:59,482
Stop!

27
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,605
Pay heed!

28
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:06,843
They have no idea why anyone would
risk their Iives in a death maze

29
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:08,565
for 80 bucks on a good day.

30
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,357
But if you're out here
thinking about the money,

31
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,002
you're not gonna be around to spend it.

32
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,561
Hey!

33
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:59,203
Hey, it's Vanessa.
Leave me a message and I'II call you back.

34
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:03,041
'Kay, I'm actually leaving a voice mail now.
This is demeaning. Why won't you call me?

35
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:04,876
Hey.

36
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,078
- Samantha Harris, TVM?
- Yep.

37
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,203
And sign here, please.

38
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:16,919
You need a number, too?

39
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:19,324
- You got a pickup for me?
- You already got it.

40
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,642
Positive I did not.

41
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,001
No, someone from your company.

42
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:23,602
What'd he look like?

43
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,359
He was prettier than me.

44
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:38,679
Hey, watch your back.

45
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,646
Manny's office, this is Manny.

46
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:53,842
Dude, you jumped my route?

47
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,999
l had a drop-off.
It was sitting right there, man.

48
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,202
Dude, but that's my tag.

49
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:58,766
Then how come it's in my bag?

50
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,041
I'm coming to get it.

51
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:01,685
Wasting your time, man.
I'm almost there already.

52
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:03,801
Well, I'm right behind you.

53
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,481
Yo, it isn't yours, it's mine now.
Like your girIfriend.

54
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,683
Oh, I'm getting worried, dude.
Real concerned.

55
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,645
It's been a couple of days.
Manny's a gentleman,

56
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,718
but Manny's got appetites. Click!

57
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:15,321
Asshole.

58
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:34,317
No, no, no, sweetheart.
Think Gandhi, not Sitting Bull. Boom!

59
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:35,396
Yes, I'm already on it.

60
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,840
Sweetheart, I gotta go.

61
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,565
Security Courier.

62
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:40,998
- Get line two a 20 on Squid.
- Got it.

63
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,079
I'm right here. Goddamn radio got run over.

64
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,237
Raj. What the hell, man.
Manny jumped my route?

65
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,442
ls it so?

66
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:50,564
Yes, it's so. You shouldn't try to be Zen,
dude. You're wearing a gold chain.

67
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:54,720
Tito, my midtown monster,
slow and steady comes in last.

68
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,399
You get passed by a hot dog cart today?

69
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,604
The pedals turn, Raj.
Not just the left one, but the right one, too.

70
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,120
l have no idea what he's talking about.

71
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:05,166
The words he says, they don't go together
to create meaning in a traditional sense,

72
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,646
but I believe it is profound.

73
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,399
Hey, I'm light. You got anything else today?

74
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:10,478
- l need another job.
- The pedals turn, my friend, the pedals turn.

75
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,762
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Well, Tito said it, not me.

76
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,082
No hello?

77
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,761
Hey, Vanessa, I hope you're gonna fix
that wheel and get back out there.

78
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:18,882
Yep.

79
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:25,966
Why didn't you call me back?

80
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,436
l don't have anything else to say.

81
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,404
Okay, I know you're not
about to kiss me right now.

82
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:35,523
Why? You don't want me to?

83
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,165
My hand to God, I don't.

84
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,726
Then why did your back just arch?

85
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,001
- It did not.
- Yes, it did.

86
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:42,123
- Nope.
- Like it always does.

87
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:45,597
- See, you did it again.
- Stop!

88
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,918
- Really? Come on.
- No.

89
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:50,556
Okay. Ride safe.

90
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:52,681
Security Courier.

91
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,837
Yo, Nima, what's up?

92
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,278
Yeah, he's here. Where we going?

93
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,516
Okay.

94
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,524
Okay. All right. Great. Got it.

95
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:04,962
Wilee, you're in luck.
Your alma mater summons.

96
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:08,756
116th Street entrance,
law school main office, drop is in Chinatown.

97
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:11,202
l need you south of Pell in 90 minutes.
Let's go.

98
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,357
You're getting 50 for that run at least.
Give me 40.

99
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:15,119
Forget it. Tito.

100
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:16,242
Never mind.

101
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:19,239
Marco. Polo.
l got a nice long run for you guys.

102
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:20,521
- Can't do it.
- Why not?

103
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,199
- Gotta get hammered.
- Fair enough.

104
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:25,643
Come on, man. I'm tired, I'm hungry, my day
is taking a turn for the shitty, give me the 40.

105
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,525
I'll give you 30. Don't screw it up.
It's premium rush.

106
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:33,035
Hey, Wilee.

107
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,277
You and me, man! Central Park. Just one lap.

108
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,846
Straight up bicycle race.

109
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,839
No whale riding, no bumper surfing,
none-a your alleycat bullshit.

110
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,635
I'll kick your ass, man.
Have you seen my thighs?

111
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,763
Have you seen my thighs?

112
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:07,556
What do you want?

113
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,520
So you into Spandex now?

114
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:11,166
On your right!

115
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:14,081
God, can you forget about Manny?
He's just helping me move.

116
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,284
Move? What, you guys are moving?

117
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,881
- No, I'm moving, she's staying.
- Why?

118
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,435
I don't wanna talk about it.
She wants me out by the end of the day.

119
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,040
What, did you get into a fight with her, too?

120
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,480
I'll call you back.

121
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,000
Shit.

122
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,557
Hey, walk that thing!

123
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,917
Wilee? Ýt is you.

124
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,406
Hey, man.

125
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,246
Hey, what you been up to, man?

126
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,204
You know, running reds, killing peds.

127
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,164
l heard you never took the bar.

128
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,885
It's on my list.

129
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,161
Don't stress about it.

130
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:04,636
Hey, they say if you snort some Ritalin,
it's a cakewalk.

131
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,479
Sage advice, Mr. Hand.

132
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,882
Hey, Nima. They didn't tell me
it was you who called. That it?

133
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:17,004
It must be there by 7:00.
Deliver only to Sister Chen.

134
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:18,156
Where am I going?

135
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:22,206
Chinatown. 147, Doyers.
ls that going to be difficuIt?

136
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:23,882
Would be for some.

137
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,677
- It's a tiny street very hard to see...
- I'll find it. Time is now 5:33.

138
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,965
Sign here
and print your name under it, please.

139
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,156
You okay?

140
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:39,680
l heard you got roommate troubles.
l feel bad, I kinda hooked you guys up.

141
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:43,555
Deliver only to Sister Chen.
It must be there by 7:00.

142
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,195
It's extremely important.

143
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:47,235
Always is.

144
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,082
Gonna need the envelope.

145
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,364
Thanks. Have a nice day.

146
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,356
Hey!

147
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,205
Hey, there you are.

148
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:37,842
Hey!

149
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,800
Hey, excuse me, messenger guy.

150
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,798
That envelope you picked up,
l gotta ask for it back.

151
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,240
- Who are you?
- Forrest J. Ackerman.

152
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,477
Head of campus security.
The woman who gave you the envelope,

153
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,285
she's not authorised
to use the school account.

154
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,120
It's an internal matter I've been investigating.
Not your problem.

155
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:51,526
Can I have the envelope, please?

156
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,242
Yeah, the thing is, once it goes in the bag,
it's gotta stay in the bag

157
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,885
unless I hear from a dispatcher.

158
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:58,606
Fine. Call him. I'll talk to him.
l got the receipt right here.

159
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,643
- Nima gave that to you?
- Who?

160
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,356
Nima.

161
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:05,200
You don't know the name
of the woman you're investigating?

162
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:07,676
Yeah. Nima, right. I'm sorry,
l couldn't hear you. Your mouth was full.

163
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:12,162
Thing is, man, company I work for,
it's called "Security Courier."

164
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,556
The "Security" part means that
once people give us their shit,

165
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,036
we don't just hand it out to
random strangers on the street, so...

166
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:20,080
Listen, I just spent $7
on this delicious urban food log,

167
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,397
so if you'd step aside and let me eat,
that'd be great.

168
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:25,596
What's your name?

169
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,120
- Wilee.
- Wilee.

170
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,276
Wile E? Like the coyote?

171
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,441
- That's cute.
- Thanks.

172
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,483
You got a real name? A girIfriend?

173
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,922
Family? People who give a shit
if they see you again?

174
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,241
Who are you, man?

175
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:41,716
I'm the guy you don't fuck with.

176
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:46,676
Hold my log.

177
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:52,515
Hey!

178
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,799
Have a nice day, douche bag!

179
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,396
Okay.

180
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,406
l just wanted to say I was sorry.

181
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:23,196
That thing was important to me.
Maybe that doesn't mean shit to you...

182
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,164
No, it means something to me.
l just forgot, that's all.

183
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:26,521
Okay, I get it.

184
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,240
Look, this is three sorrys now.

185
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:29,521
It's actually only two.

186
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:32,644
Well, you hung up on one of'em,
so that's on you.

187
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,600
l don't get it. Honestly? Watch it!

188
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:36,722
Excuse me.

189
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,286
l just don't get it.

190
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:41,245
l mean, you have opportunity
and all that brain and you throw it away.

191
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,080
Look, why are we having this conversation?
You get it. You ride like I do.

192
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,557
No, I ride, but not like you, Wilee.
l put a brake on my bike and I use it.

193
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,956
Yeah, and that brake's gonna get you killed.
You should get rid of that.

194
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,117
The worst shit that ever happened to me
happened when I had a brake.

195
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:53,435
Brakes are death.

196
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:57,646
You know what?
That thing you say, it's not as cute any more.

197
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,365
You could have any job you want.

198
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,439
When I see a guy in a grey business suit,
my age,

199
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,757
makes my balls shrivel up into my abdomen.

200
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:05,996
Whatever.

201
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,122
Hi, Alonzo.

202
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:10,119
We get paid to ride.
What could be better than that?

203
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,879
Do you know why I ride?

204
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,083
Because I hate waiting tables. Thank you.

205
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:17,557
Look, I'm sorry
that I didn't come to your school thing.

206
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,160
But what do you want me to
do about it right now?

207
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,282
My "schooI thing"?

208
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,120
It was graduation
and you blew it off for a race.

209
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,562
Look, I know it took me eight years
to get my degree,

210
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:29,117
but I'm gonna get a decent job
and sit behind a desk all day.

211
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,641
l don't need anyone in my life
telling me that it's meaningless

212
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,319
'cause it means something to me.

213
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,637
And I need to know that I can count on you.

214
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,036
Hello?

215
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,038
- l gotta go.
- Of course you do.

216
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,083
I'm gonna call you back.

217
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:45,596
Hey, what?

218
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,321
Douche bag?
What the hell's the matter with you?

219
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,285
Come on, son, this is silly.
You're gonna skin your knee.

220
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,323
l think I'll be all right. Thank you, though.

221
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:54,999
Just pull over, right up here.

222
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:56,756
Come on.

223
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,843
You're a very uncooperative guy,
you know that?

224
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,159
- Come on, give it to me!
- No!

225
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:06,842
You take care now!

226
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:09,881
Shit!

227
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:44,316
Shit.

228
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,722
I'm chasing a bicycle.

229
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:18,801
Jesus.

230
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,115
Tricky.

231
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,639
- You moron!
- You're right!

232
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:56,797
- You maniac!
- Sorry! My fauIt!

233
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:02,282
Hey! Give me the envelope!

234
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:03,722
What?

235
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:06,480
- You can hear me, you little shit.
- Sorry, I can't hear you!

236
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,797
What's it to you? Come on!

237
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,766
Give me the goddamn envelope!

238
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,965
That? No.

239
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:23,359
No, no, no.

240
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:31,966
l just wish they wouldn't ride
on the sidewalk, you know?

241
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:34,003
l mean, look,
l understand you've got a job to do.

242
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,075
Excuse me!

243
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:47,162
Hey, hey!

244
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:49,158
Hey, hey, hey! Slow down!

245
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,241
Now, see?
l told you this wouldn't end well for you.

246
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,720
Where'd you go?

247
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,316
Hey!

248
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:06,961
Come here!

249
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,885
Hey!

250
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,005
Yo, you crazy?

251
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,486
NYPD! Ý wanna talk to you for a minute!

252
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:23,761
Great.

253
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,006
Hey! Pull over!

254
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,156
Hey!

255
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,484
Delinquent scum!

256
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,080
Red shirt on the bicycle!

257
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:40,640
NYPD!

258
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:45,160
You just caused an accident back there!
Pull over!

259
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:48,602
Come on.

260
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,236
Oh, shit!

261
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:16,802
My baby!

262
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,401
Shit.

263
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,641
You little shit.

264
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:57,405
- Thanks for helping me with this.
- You know I'm always there for you.

265
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,604
Well, I couldn't have done it on my own,
so thanks.

266
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:03,402
Look, it's none of my business,

267
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:06,843
but you know you saved yourseIf a lot of
heartache breaking up with the Coyote Man.

268
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,077
l mean, seriously, you know, he's crazy.

269
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,078
And it's not like
he's some great cyclist or something.

270
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:15,001
l mean, he's just got a death wish, that's all.
That's no skill.

271
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,079
Only reason he beats me in alleycats
is'cause the man got a mental instability.

272
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,159
l mean, all that fixie bullshit.
You know, the no brakes, no gears.

273
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:28,602
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, I hear ya.

274
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,360
Look, think about it, okay?

275
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:35,765
He's broke his left collarbone twice.
Got a couple concussions, a pin in his wrist.

276
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:38,839
That's when he was doing all that trick stuff.
He's not into that any more.

277
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,840
Okay, sure, but the way he rides.
What does that tell you?

278
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:44,965
How much he loves it, I guess.

279
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,836
Then he's got him
some confused priorities, babe.

280
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:56,757
Yeah. No, Manny.

281
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,923
Hey, my roommate's in some kind of trouble
and she won't text me back.

282
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:06,761
Can you just drop me off over on Broadway?
Please? Ý gotta go find her.

283
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,917
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Thanks.

284
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,241
Jesus.

285
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,001
Shit.

286
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,640
- This douche bag tried to...
- l can hear you.

287
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:34,842
Sorry.

288
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:37,842
Guy tried to rob me
and run me over with his car.

289
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,326
- Are you injured?
- No.

290
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,682
- You wanna file a complaint?
- No, I want him arrested.

291
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,803
It's like attempted vehicular manslaughter,
or whatever.

292
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:44,922
ls it, Your Honour? Have a seat,

293
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:46,281
someone will be right out to
take your statement.

294
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,437
l also have a picture
of his licence plate number.

295
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,643
That's fantastic.
Have a seat, someone will be right with you.

296
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:52,877
Thank you for your concern.

297
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,440
Holy moly.

298
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:19,160
Hey. What do ya know?

299
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:21,957
Detective Monday graces us
with his presence.

300
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,321
Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late.

301
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,477
Your wife had a lot of unusual requests.

302
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,842
- Yeah? She still got that rash?
- Yeah. I worked around it.

303
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:31,196
What's the matter with your face, Monday?

304
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:34,683
Goddamn tooth went abscess on me,
vicious little bastard. I go to the dentist,

305
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,116
son of a bitch got me in the waiting room
an hour and a haIf.

306
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:39,562
Finally, he sits me in the chair,
takes one look at it...

307
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:43,356
Yanks it right out of my head.
Can you believe it? Yeah, that's why I'm late.

308
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:04,955
Oh, yeah.

309
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,957
Yeah. Got you now, sucker.

310
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:14,875
Monster hand, monster hand.

311
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,680
Jesus, you're kidding me!

312
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:21,965
Goddamn shit! No!

313
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:25,244
Next time better luck, Bobby, huh?
Not bad hand, not bad hand.

314
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,356
Almost, Bobby.

315
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,526
Everything okay, Bobby?

316
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,956
It's great. I just gotta get to work is all.

317
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,719
Same old, same old.

318
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:38,441
Mr. Monday, Mr. Sunday.

319
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:42,556
Rebuy.

320
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,039
Hello? Rebuy.

321
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,245
- Let me get you a Coke, Bobby.
- No, thank you.

322
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:59,160
- l need five grand. What's the problem?
- It's up to 17.

323
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,760
Which happens to be my lucky number.

324
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,407
This isn't your game, man.
Anglos don't have the math for Pai Gow.

325
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,876
- Mr. Lin thinks...
- What does Mr. Lin think?

326
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,435
He can't get shut down
'cause a cop owes him a few dollars?

327
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:10,916
- Come on, you don't wanna talk like that.
- 72nd Street. Brooklyn Players.

328
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:13,965
They all went down eventually.
They all go down, Charlie Chan.

329
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:17,005
- Maybe you need to go get some fresh air.
- You take a walk in the park!

330
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:18,202
l want a rebuy!

331
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,562
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.

332
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:26,762
Sorry.

333
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,758
Look, if you really need cash...

334
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,242
- l shouldn't be telling you this.
- What?

335
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,045
You know that bitch snakehead
my sister works for?

336
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,083
- Yeah.
- She said they got a serious ticket

337
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,397
coming down from a hawaladar
in Morningside, tonight.

338
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,477
- How much is it worth?
- Fifty grand.

339
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,444
And that ticket is as good as cash.

340
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,199
If you get a hold of that thing
and bring it here,

341
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,118
your money problems with us are over.

342
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:49,358
Maybe I take a little finder's fee,
let's just say a third.

343
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:52,007
Mr. Lin gets the rest, and you're even.

344
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:55,526
What do I look like,
a change-snatcher to you? Ý'm a cop.

345
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:57,598
l look like a purse-pincher,
a goddamn mugger?

346
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,643
I'm just trying to help you out.

347
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:04,403
You don't wanna do that, then be a big boy,
go to the Shy, borrow what you gotta borrow.

348
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,843
- Mr. Lin gets his 17, you're right back in.
- Yeah.

349
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,280
- What's the vig?
- Twenty points.

350
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,358
- That's ridiculous.
- Don't take it.

351
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:19,166
- From our friends in Ozone Park?
- You wish.

352
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:20,646
- Brighton Beach.
- Shit.

353
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,683
Seriously, don't take it.

354
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:25,635
Give it to me.

355
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,359
Hey, where you going?

356
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:49,556
- He took it across the street.
- l have now seen it all.

357
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:51,239
Look at that sick bastard.

358
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:09,596
Come on.

359
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:12,996
Yeah, come on, come on.

360
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:16,003
Are you sure you want
to put that all in one hand?

361
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:17,520
Yeah, I'm sure.

362
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:19,876
Come on.

363
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,525
This is the one.

364
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:25,245
Let's see, what do we got here?
What do we got?

365
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:27,761
Keep your eyes to yourseIf, all right, buddy?

366
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,406
I'm not done.

367
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:31,563
Six plus seven is shit!

368
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:32,875
Six plus five is shit.

369
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,959
Eight plus five is six... ls seven... ls shit.

370
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:38,720
It's all shit, no matter how you add it up.

371
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:43,362
Yeah.

372
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,884
Whatever, whatever. Thanks a lot.

373
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:54,682
- That a Chinese phone book?
- Yeah.

374
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,520
Don't stop yet.

375
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:03,163
Why, you getting tired?
Hey, wait a minute. Wait.

376
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:08,241
Tired, my ass.

What... That...

378
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:23,165
That's my tooth! You piece of shit!

379
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:25,158
l said nothing permanent!

380
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:27,798
Hey, I'm talking to you! Get over here!

381
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:32,605
There are goddamn rules about this shit!
Okay? You think it doesn't apply?

382
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:34,518
I'll take a lump or two if I cross the line,

383
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:36,438
but you think I'm gonna grow new teeth
at my age?

384
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,683
- Mr. Lin...
- Mr. Lin!

385
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:39,961

Let me tell ya something, boys. I am a cop!

389
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:56,366
You do not do this!

390
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:06,081
Hey. Come on, it wasn't that bad.

391
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,965
He'll be all right. Come on. Come on, papi.

00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:17,524
Yeah, there you go. See?

393
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,798
Get your buddy to Bellevue.

394
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:28,602
Fourteen minutes. I timed it.

395
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:32,282
That's how long it took you
to soak yourseIf in gasoline and set it on fire.

396
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,281
That ticket you were talking about?

397
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,242
l think I'm gonna need the address.

398
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:47,883
Yeah, the goddamn dentist.
ls that a good enough reason for you?

399
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,037
Two hours in the chair. Can you believe it?

400
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:53,642
Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

401
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:56,958
I'm gonna go get my morphine.
I'll be right back.

402
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,322
- You know, I've been thinking about firemen.
- What about'em?

403
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:50,316
They hang out together,
you know, they work out. They cook pasta.

404
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:51,522
Pose for calendars.

405
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:53,798
- What are you talking about?
- We should do that.

406
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:55,002
I'm not posing for any calendar.

407
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:03,676
No towels?

408
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,086
Depressing.

409
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:35,924

411
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:40,439
- What's up?
- What happened to you?

412
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:43,246
l just got my ass kicked by a kid on a bicycle.

413
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:45,682
- Jesus, you okay?
- I'm all right.

414
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:49,877
Monday, come on, we gotta see that guy.

415
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:51,605
Yeah, all right.

416
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,636
Monday, seriously, we gotta go. Let's go.

417
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:00,996
You talk to him this time.
He responds to you better.

418
00:30:01,087 --> 00:30:04,443
Really? Ý don't know why.
l can't stand the guy.

419
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:06,842
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

420
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,678
Monday, are you coming?

421
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:19,960
Yeah, l...

422
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,800
l forgot my bullets.
I'll meet you guys there, okay?

423
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,799
Who forgets their bullets?

424
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:27,002
Monday.

425
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:57,596
Shit.

426
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,518
Hey, red shirt! NYPD!

427
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:09,756
Come on, dude.

Oh, really? Ý'm working on it.

00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,200
- The guy's dead.
- What?

430
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:21,040
The guy you beat up, Bobby.
He didn't even make the ride to the hospital.

431
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:22,685
You got a real knack for making it worse,
you know that?

432
00:31:25,487 --> 00:31:26,886
God damn it.

433
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,161
I'll make amends.

434
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:30,236
Start with the money.

435
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:32,517
Get that ticket.
Bring it to Mr. Lin's shop on 28th.

436
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,279
You got one hour.

437
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:48,959
Heads up. Look out, look out. Outta the way.

438
00:31:57,887 --> 00:32:00,355
Police! On your left, lady, look out!

439
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,726
Jesus Christ.

440
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,361
What do you want me to do?

441
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:14,597
Hello, everybody! Stand still!

442
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:16,279
Lady, stand still! You're good. There you go.

443
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:22,640
Police! Coming through. Lady, please.

444
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:24,121
Heads up, man.

445
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:38,686
Whoa, buddy!

446
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,398
Oh, my God! Stop already!

447

You're making it worse for yourseIf,
l swear to God!

448
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:57,165
Keep the kids back! Keep'em back! NYPD!

00:33:57,447 --> 00:33:59,563
Get your arms inside the bus!

454
00:34:26,687 --> 00:34:27,676
Dispatch.

455
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,564
What did you do to me, man?
What the hell am I carrying?

456
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:30,682
Wilee? Where are you?

l do not carry drug shit,
or whatever the hell this is!

458
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,398
It's not drugs. It can't be drugs.

459
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,478
It's from a highly respected
East Coast college.

460
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,000
- It's probably drugs.
- Yep.

461
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:42,437
Listen to me. I almost got my ass killed
three times in the last 20 minutes!

462
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:43,642
And it wasn't my fauIt!

463
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,883
ls somebody messing with you?
You need backup?

464
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,083
No. I just wanna get rid of the thing.

465
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,202
Well, I got nobody else.

466
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,482
The only person here is Tito,
and I can't send him that far north.

467
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,286
The guy's like 98 years old. No offence.

468
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:56,236
Dude, just call the college

469
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,477
and tell them I'm bringing the package back,
okay? Ý'm done with it.

470
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,963
No, no, don't take it back! Come on! Wilee...

Just the person I need to see.

What's up?

474
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:40,040
Yeah, hello. I'm calling about

Yep, yep, got it right here. 2231970.

477
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:52,325
Yeah, that's it.

478
00:35:53,207 --> 00:35:57,041
I'm gonna need to change
the delivery address on that envelope.

479
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,757
Yeah. Me, I'm Forrest J. Ackerman,
Dean of Students.

Okay.

- Hey.

483
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:47,401
I'm almost done.
My friend borrowed a truck to help me move,

484
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:49,637
so I'll be outta here by 6:00.

485
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:51,001
Thank you.

486
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:54,124
I'm sorry it is so sudden.
You will be all right?

487
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:57,040
Yeah. I'm staying with my aunt
until I find a place.

488
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,276
Okay, good.

489
00:36:58,367 --> 00:36:59,720
l still don't get what happened.

490
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:01,798
Did I do something
to piss you off or something?

491
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,798
No, I told you, it's a private matter.

492
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:05,876
Okay.

493
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:09,326
Excuse me, I have some things
to take care of.

494
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,398
- Where'd you get all that?
- This is my business.

495
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,478
- Better for you to stay out of it.
- Are you going out with that?

496
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,876
'Cause this is New York City,
you can't walk around with all that money.

497
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:30,037
- Where are you going?
- Down the street.

498
00:37:30,127 --> 00:37:31,321
- Where?
- The nail salon.

499
00:37:31,487 --> 00:37:32,476
The nail salon?

500
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,001
This is something I have to do.
l don't have a choice.

501
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,281
Okay. I'm coming with you.

502
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:37,960
No, thank you.

503
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,200

You got a minute?

00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:01,561
Count it.

507
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:07,483
A lot of money for a young lady.

508
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:10,241
Took me two years. I work three jobs.

509
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:13,598
American dream, huh?

510
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,321
ls to work three jobs?

511
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,285
These days, yes.

512
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,246
You speak Mandarin?

513
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,000
Yes.

514
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:28,515
If you lose the ticket
l cannot give you back the money.

515
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:30,879
You understand?

516
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:34,517
This ticket now is money.

517
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:37,682
For whoever holds it.

518
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:42,163
If you have problems

519
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:44,763
you don't call the police

520
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:47,159
you call this number.

521
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:52,962
The Hawala system settles its own problems.

522
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:58,201
This money is for a snakehead?

523
00:39:58,327 --> 00:39:59,806
- Yes.
- Which one?

524
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:01,236
Sister Chen.

525
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,159
She won't take cash.

526
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:04,919
She sent me to you.

527
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:09,879
Did you tell anyone you were coming here?

528
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,039
Only my friend.

529
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:15,965
This city is not your village.

530
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:20,356
Many people would rob you
if they know what you have.

531
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:22,485
My friend wouldn't tell anyone.

532
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:25,241
If she did they may be watching for you.

533
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,441
Can someone else deliver the ticket for you?

534
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:37,480
Someone they won't recognise?

535
00:40:38,447 --> 00:40:39,846
l don't know.

536
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,036
Think about it.

537
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:45,484
May the Buddha watch over you.

538
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:07,356
Hey!

539
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,720
Security Courier.

540
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,286
Yo, Nima. What's up?

541
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:41,565
l have a pickup from our office.
It will be ready in about 10 minutes.

542
00:41:42,487 --> 00:41:43,522
ls Wilee available?

543
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,958
Yeah, he's here. Where we going?

544
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:47,082
Okay.

545
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,959
Okay, all right. Great. Got it.

546
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:53,078
Wilee, you're in luck.
Your alma mater summons.

547
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:02,641
Come on!

548
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,759
Good to see you, too.

549
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,286
Excuse me.

550
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:54,196
Damn.

551
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:58,841
Damn it.

552
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,805
- Hey. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

553
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:02,922
NYPD.

554
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:07,239
I'm looking for a young Asian woman,
about 22, 23, blue shirt, black pants.

555
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:09,318
She just walked by a minute ago.

556
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:11,238
- Know where I can find her?
- Let me think. Yeah, I do.

557
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,238
Hey, walk that thing!

558
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:14,396
Yeah, I believe so.

559
00:43:16,447 --> 00:43:18,403
Thanks. Have a nice day.

560
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:25,875
Hey! Hey, there you are.

561
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:28,800
Hey, there.

562
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,922
Forrest J. Ackerman, lnternal Revenue
Service, Wire Fraud lnvestigation Unit.

563
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:34,116
Yes?

564
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:38,564
Now, young lady, you realise this system
of money transfer you're participating in

565
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:41,719
circumvents about 18 different
United States banking regulations?

566
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,518
- I'm not sure I understand.
- Relax.

567
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:47,600
It's not you that's facing jail time.
At least I don't think so.

568
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:51,441
These hawaladars are known to prey on
unsuspecting illegal immigrants.

569
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:53,956
- I'm not illegal.
- We don't have to get into that.

570
00:43:54,047 --> 00:43:55,799
- l have a student visa.
- With you?

571
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,036
At home.

572
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:59,482
See, it's supposed to be with you at all times.

573
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:02,035
Yeah, you leave it at home,
that's a good way to get yourseIf deported.

574
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:04,482
But we don't have to go down to lmmigration
and talk about that now.

575
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:07,286
That's totally unnecessary.
We need to settle it right here.

576
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:11,042
l just need to see the envelope
the hawaladar gave you. Please.

577
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:14,646
l don't understand.

578
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,806
What don't you understand?

579
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:22,285
Why someone who says he's an lRS agent
has a New York City police detective's badge.

580
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,240
Come over here.

581
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:28,761
Okay.

582
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:32,402
What are you doing? Let me go!

583
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:34,406
Okay, smarty-pants.

584
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,717
You know what the HR shrink said I have?

585
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,279
lmpulse control issues.

586
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,275
Like you need a college degree
to figure that out.

587
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:47,643
I'm telling you this so you know
that it's in your best interest

588
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,922
not to lie to me or waste my time,

589
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:52,202
but give me the goddamn envelope.

590
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:55,836
Please. Before I lose my shit
and rip your throat out.

591
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:57,361
Clear enough?

592
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:01,115
What's that?

593
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,799
What did you do?

594
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:17,399
Damn it. Damn it.

595
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:20,236
Hey!

596
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:22,281
Excuse me!

597
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:23,925
Messenger guy!

598
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:26,999
That envelope you just picked up?
I'm gonna have to ask for that back.

599
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:31,599
What are you doing here?

600
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,166
- What is up with you?
- Nothing.

601
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:34,805
Well, that doesn't look like nothing.

602
00:45:34,887 --> 00:45:36,878
It's my problem. It's personal.

603
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,878
Did that cop find you?

604
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:40,880
You saw him?

605
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:42,921
What did you tell him?

606
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,805
He said there were some people planning to
rob you and he was trying to stop it.

607
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:47,320
He wanted to help you.

608
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:50,126
- Yes, he helped me very much.
- What's going on?

609
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:52,755
- You're no friend. We are not friends.
- Yes, we are.

610
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:55,725
l told you one thing,
and you almost ruined it all.

611
00:45:55,807 --> 00:45:57,081
I'll take care of myseIf.

612
00:45:57,247 --> 00:46:00,876
Nima. You gotta start trusting somebody.
Please, tell me.

613
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:03,325
What's going on?

614
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:09,123
Wilee? What are you doing here?

615
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:10,242
Nima.

616
00:46:10,327 --> 00:46:11,806
You can't have delivered already,
it's not possible.

617
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:13,559
You know what?
It's really uncool to let a messenger service

618
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:15,080
deliver your illegal bullshit.

619
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:16,646
- Where is my envelope?
- It's hard enough out there.

620
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:19,685
- Where is it?
- l gave it back to the front desk.

621
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:27,482
Did a messenger just come by
and drop off an envelope?

622
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,558
Yeah, and another one
just came and picked it up.

623
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,396
Who told them to change the address?

624
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,356
Hey.

625
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,596
You get your envelope back?

626
00:46:59,247 --> 00:47:00,600
Someone else come and pick it up?

627
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,204
But it's going to the wrong place.

628
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:05,276
What?

629
00:47:05,887 --> 00:47:06,922
Why?

630
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,122
What do you care?

631
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:28,681
So, what was that thing I was carrying?

632
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:32,602
It's like a receipt for a great deal of money.

633
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:35,645
What's the money for?

634
00:47:35,807 --> 00:47:37,877
A she-tou. A snakehead.

635
00:47:38,327 --> 00:47:40,761
- What's that?
- It's a kind of importer.

636
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:46,158
Right. So you're involved
in some kind of drug thing?

637
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,402
No.

638
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:50,838
What are you "importing"?

639
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:55,402
My son.

640
00:47:56,887 --> 00:48:00,926
l came to this country on a student visa.
He was to come right after me.

641
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:04,126
It is not illegal. He can travel on my visa.

642
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:08,800
But then an article I wrote about Tibet
a long time ago was posted on the lnternet.

643
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,718
For the past years
they have not let him leave China.

644
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:18,446
So I have to get him out another way.

645
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:20,199
Because I will have my son.

646
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:27,123
Why'd you have to go and ask for me?

647
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:31,438
Vanessa always said you was the best
at what you do.

648
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:33,725
She says maybe she can never count on you,

649
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:36,884
but at work, there's no one better.

650
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:39,085
She said that?

651
00:48:39,447 --> 00:48:40,766
ls it true?

652
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,805
Can I count on you?

653
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:49,007
Let me see the name on the sheet.

654
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:57,156
How come you don't answer my calls?

655
00:48:57,247 --> 00:48:59,363
Because I got a business to run.
What do you want?

656
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:03,201
You picked up an envelope from Nima
at the college office at 5:30. Where is it?

657
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:04,515
Jesus, what is it with this envelope?

658
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:07,121
People love it, they hate it, they gotta have it,
they gotta get rid of it.

659
00:49:07,207 --> 00:49:08,799
It's like cigarettes or Democrats.

660
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:10,440
Where is the opener?

661
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:11,642
Who's got it, Raj?

662
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:14,600
Your boy Wilee pussied out.
He said he was taking it back.

663
00:49:14,687 --> 00:49:15,961
So it's back at the school?

664
00:49:16,047 --> 00:49:18,880
Negativo. Somebody called to
change the drop-off address.

665
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,720
Why are there a million tools in here
and nothing to open a beer?

666
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:24,082
- A man or a woman?
- That would be a dude.

667
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,520
So who's gonna pick it up?

668
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:27,040
l gave it to Manny.

669
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:28,162
Shit.

670
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:03,724
Which way are you going,
you roided-out freak?

671
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,876
Really?

672
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:23,476
Hey, where are you?

673
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,637
Corner of Broadway and Kiss My Ass.
What do you want?

674
00:50:25,727 --> 00:50:27,206
Need that envelope you just got.

675
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:28,356
Oh, do you really?

676
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:30,165
Yeah, seriously. You don't know what it is.

677
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:32,397
l know exactly what it is,
50 bucks if I get it there by 7:00.

678
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:34,883
What, you're getting 50?
Raj is only giving me 30!

679
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,366
Yeah, speed costs money, pussy!

680
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:38,797
Pull over and give it to me, man!
I'll explain later.

681
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:41,720
Okay, pussy, I'll wait right here.
There, I just stopped at 112th.

682
00:50:43,527 --> 00:50:45,836
Bullshit, dude, I can hear the wind.
You're still moving.

683
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:49,602
Yeah, Manny rides fast!
You should try it, it feels good!

684
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:52,118
Hello? Asshole!

685
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:55,805
- Wilee?
- Now you want to talk?

686
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:57,320
This whole thing is my fauIt.

687
00:50:57,607 --> 00:51:00,360
You're hard to keep track of.
l accept your apology. Can I call you back?

688
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:03,166
That envelope Nima gave you is for her kid.
She has a kid.

689
00:51:03,287 --> 00:51:05,403
- l know. I just talked to her.
- Well, do you still have it?

690
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:07,995
I'm chasing it down Broadway right now.
l really gotta call you back.

691
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:10,999
Manny is taking it to the wrong people.
l tried to call him, but he won't pick up.

692
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:12,560
I'm on it. I'll get him.

693
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:14,842
No, it's my fauIt.
You don't need to get involved.

694
00:51:15,007 --> 00:51:18,204
- Well, it's on my way home anyway.
- Just tell me where you are.

695
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:20,926
Baby, this situation sucks.
l don't want you anywhere near it.

696
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:23,965
Hey, Jersey,
you wanna move your fat-ass SUV!

697
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,084
You know how sexy you are
when you talk like that?

698
00:51:26,207 --> 00:51:27,799
- Wilee.
- I'll call you when I deliver.

699
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:30,077
- Wait!
- Count on it.

700
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:34,116
Shit.

701
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:51,160
Hey, Wilee, I got an idea.
Why don't you race me for it?

702
00:51:51,247 --> 00:51:54,045
You get to 28th Street before I do,
I'II give you the envelope.

703
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:55,845
We'II go through the park. Enter on 106.

704
00:51:55,927 --> 00:51:57,565
l don't have time for this bullshit, man.

705
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,762
You don't got the legs for it, man.

706
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,077
And that steel pig you're riding
ain't gonna help you neither.

707
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:04,045
Be like me, baby.
Parlee, custom-cut carbon fibre!

708
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:05,401
l am begging you.

709
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:07,319
My bike fits me like a Naturalamb, son.

710
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:08,681
Just listen for one second.

711
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:09,756
See you in the park.

712
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:11,075
- Manny!
- Peace!

713
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:12,520
God damn it.

714
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:18,244
Okay. You wanna race, let's race.

715
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:41,481
Dispatch.

716
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:43,876
Raj, I need that address
you sent Manny to right now.

717
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:46,276
Manny? Come on.
Don't the three of you ever get tired

718
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:48,119
of this Real World shit you keep playing?

719
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,242
Raj!

720
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:51,636
Manny, Wilee, Wilee, Manny.

721
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:54,476
When does Raj get to climb Mount Vanessa?

722
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:56,598
The address, God damn it!

723
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,838
Hold on, let me look for it.

724
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:03,207
Piece of shit.

725
00:53:16,687 --> 00:53:17,881
Fellas.

726
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:21,122
Manny!

727
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:22,965
I'll give you the 50 bucks!

728
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:25,561
Manny can't hear you,
Manny's moving too fast.

729
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:28,116
Come on, man, you don't wanna drag
your hefty ass up this hill.

730
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,119
Not a problem for me, baby.
I'll just drop into my little ring.

731
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:41,725
Hey, Fixie, I bet you wish you had gears now,
don't you?

732
00:53:54,887 --> 00:53:57,276
Gravity, you is my friend again, baby.

733
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:15,521
Hey, Wilee, I got something for ya!

734
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,239
You like that, huh?

735
00:54:18,407 --> 00:54:20,523
Yeah, I know you do, you little bitch.

736
00:54:43,567 --> 00:54:46,445
l got you, Spandex! Ý'm on your wheel!

737
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,596
I'm in your draft, dude!
It's like you're on my team!

738
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:54,724
- Slow down! Hey.
- Guys, get off of the path!

739
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:58,562
21 dispatch. 21 dispatch, come in.

740
00:54:59,207 --> 00:55:00,765
2-1, bike post 3, you on the air?

741
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:02,485
Yeah, this is Roselli. Go ahead.

742
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:05,002
Your bike freak. Beat-up white bike,
red shirt?

743
00:55:05,087 --> 00:55:06,076
Yeah?

744
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:08,397
He's at it again. Park Drive,
headed south towards 7th.

745
00:55:08,487 --> 00:55:09,761
I'm on it.

746
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:15,883
Careful on the path, ma'am.

747
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,559
Dude, when's the race starting?

748
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:52,524
People, please! Stay awake! Stay alive!

749
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:57,877
Look out! Look out!

750
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:07,476
God!

751
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,356
That one hurt.

752
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:53,439
You're too slow!

753
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:21,561
Give it up!

754
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:25,486
NYPD!

755
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:29,717
Stop the bikes! Both of you!

756
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:43,842
Back it up!

757
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,523
You're such an asshole!

758
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:54,601
Screw you, Wilee!

759
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:13,162
Billy, pull forward! Pull forward!

760
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:14,716
Hey!

761
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:29,643
Who the hell are you guys?

762
00:58:31,927 --> 00:58:32,962
Damn!

763
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:35,915
ls that it?

764
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,645
No! Gimme that! Gimme! No!

765
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,046
Look at you.

766
00:58:40,127 --> 00:58:42,880
You have got to be kidding me!
Come here! Come here!

767
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:51,280
Hey, what happened to you here?
You use that goddamn brake again?

768
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:52,641
Yeah, I took that shit off.

769
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:56,121
Thank you, Jesus.

770
00:58:56,207 --> 00:58:57,322
Hey!

771
00:58:57,647 --> 00:58:59,239
Them! Them!

772
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:00,356
This way, this way.

773
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,162
Shit!

774
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:19,916
What are you doing?

775
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:22,761
Looking for the thing.

776
00:59:22,847 --> 00:59:23,882
Here it is.

777
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:28,118
Roll this up. Really tight, really tight.

778
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:29,606
Okay. Shit.

779
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,361
l mean, holy shit, right?

780
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,562
l know.

781
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:34,762
ls it good?

782
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:36,161
Yeah.

783
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:40,801
Come on, guys.

784
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:42,481
Come on!

785
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:43,636
Hey!

786
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:45,116
No, you don't.

787
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:52,762
Oh, shit.

788
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:54,522
Wilee!

789
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,962
Shit.

790
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:25,283
Wilee? Aren't you afraid
you're gonna get killed?

791
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:26,356
You believe in Iuck.

792
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:28,085
When your number's up, your number's up.

793
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:31,284
Aren't you afraid you're gonna get killed?
I mean, the way you ride.

794
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:32,686
Wilee! Wilee!

795
01:00:34,607 --> 01:00:36,563
Aren't you afraid you're gonna get killed?

796
01:00:36,647 --> 01:00:39,400
Yeah, but if it comes,
that's just gonna come outta nowhere.

797
01:00:39,487 --> 01:00:43,685
Am I afraid? Sure, but that's part of it,
you know? There's no feeling like that.

798
01:00:43,927 --> 01:00:45,599
When your number's up, your number's up.

799
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:49,239
- You could say that.
- So you're a Buddhist, then.

800
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:53,362
Yo, give it up for Sleigh Bells!

801
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:56,122
That's what's up, that's what's up!
Sleigh Bells, yo!

802
01:00:56,207 --> 01:00:57,242
You believe in luck.

803
01:00:57,327 --> 01:00:59,238
You know it's the Taoists
that believed in luck.

804
01:00:59,327 --> 01:01:02,717
The Buddha rejected all that.
He insisted on cause and effect.

805
01:01:03,047 --> 01:01:04,639
What kind of bike messenger are you?

806
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,319
The kind with a Masters
in Bullshit and Obfuscation.

807
01:01:10,007 --> 01:01:12,316
You still haven't answered
my original question.

808
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:15,126
Aren't you afraid of dying?
l mean, the way you ride.

809
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:16,356
You wanna know what scares me

810
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:18,756
is what happened to my friends
who just got out of law school.

811
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,276
That is collective insanity.

812
01:01:21,487 --> 01:01:24,399
Compared to that, going down Broadway
at 50 with no brakes is fine.

813
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:25,476
Sounds good.

814
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:26,920
It also sounds like bullshit.

815
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:30,086
The bike wants to go fast.
It's steadier that way.

816
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:34,922
I've never been hurt going all-out.
It's just the hesitation that'll kill you.

817
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:38,081
So you're one of those guys. No brakes.

818
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:39,441
No, I hate brakes.

819
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,439
Brakes are death.

820
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,720
Now it's time to announce the winner

821
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:51,277
of the Fifth Annual New York
Bike Messenger Association Alleycat Race.

822
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:54,518
Grand prize is $100 and Felipe's bike.

823
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:57,566
You Iike that?

824
01:01:58,487 --> 01:02:01,923
To the winner for the third consecutive year,

825
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:04,003
the original bumper surfer,

826
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:07,479
the Coyote Man, Wilee!

827
01:02:08,247 --> 01:02:11,239
Wilee! That's my boy, right there!
All right, baby!

828
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,840
Well, come on. Come and get it.

829
01:02:13,447 --> 01:02:14,482
Get up here.

830
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,524
Give it up, give it up!

831
01:02:19,607 --> 01:02:20,596
Yeah!

832
01:02:21,807 --> 01:02:23,035
You back?

833
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:25,202
Where's my bike?

834
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,561
Yeah, you're back.

835
01:02:27,007 --> 01:02:28,520
- Where's my bike, seriously?
- Relax. Relax.

836
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:29,921
l can't leave without the bike.

837
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:31,526
- I'm going with him.
- No.

838
01:02:31,607 --> 01:02:33,006
- What the hell are you doing?
- You stay here.

839
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,805
Hey, I need some help over here.
This woman is unruly.

840
01:02:34,887 --> 01:02:35,922
- What?
- Calm down.

841
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:37,838
- l didn't even do anything.
- You got to relax.

842
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:38,962
Fine. Okay.

843
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,560
ls this my bag? Thank you, I appreciate that.

844
01:02:40,647 --> 01:02:43,036
Hopefully there's nothing missing.
This crazy man...

845
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,641
l don't care what happened!
Because you tackled me!

846
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:48,924
- l didn't mean to tackle you.
- Just FYl, there's a lawsuit happening.

847
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:52,795
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it or whatnot,
but there is one coming. Thank you.

848
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:56,797
All right, come on. Get your stuff.

849
01:02:56,967 --> 01:02:58,400
Hey, chief, I need to talk to you.

850
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:02,200
- Hey, what's up?
- l need to talk to you.

851
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,881
- Did he come to?
- Yeah. He's awake. A little messed up.

852
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:06,525
He's got a couple of bruised ribs,
but he'll be all right.

853
01:03:06,607 --> 01:03:08,563
- Listen, I gotta ask you a favour.
- Yeah, shoot.

854
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:10,319
l have got to talk to this guy right away.

855
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:11,522
V?

856
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:14,001
The bike.

857
01:03:16,247 --> 01:03:18,761
His partner got away.
l gotta find him before he gets too far.

858
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:20,917
ls there any way I could ride
and ask him a couple of questions?

859
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:22,076
- What, right now?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

860
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:24,522
If I could just sit with him
on the way to the hospital?

861
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:25,642
- That's very unusual.
- Oh, yeah?

862
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:28,639
- Yeah.
- Well, NYPD needs a favour. Okay?

863
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,121
Okay, chum?

864
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,357
- All right, come and ride with us.
- All right. Thanks.

865
01:03:35,367 --> 01:03:36,561
Drive.

866
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:39,115
Hey, buddy? Hey, buddy? Hey...

867
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:41,641
They're not your buddies.
You're one of these bike assholes.

868
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:44,082
You know how much time they waste
scraping you shitheads off the street?

869
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,158
This whole city hates you.

870
01:03:51,087 --> 01:03:53,681
Hey, man. You headed to the impound?

871
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:55,041
Yeah. Why?

872
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:57,516
Good. Take this thing. I'll meet you there.

873
01:03:57,607 --> 01:04:00,599
When this asshole comes for his bike,
he's mine.

874
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:10,326
Time to quit dicking around, son.

875
01:04:10,407 --> 01:04:13,046
You got involved
with some people with real problems.

876
01:04:13,127 --> 01:04:15,595
Real deadlines. Life and death shit.

877
01:04:15,687 --> 01:04:17,643
What is this to you?

878
01:04:17,727 --> 01:04:20,161
What, the slope that gave you the ticket,
she gave you some sad story?

879
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:22,522
Eighteen cousins in Fujian
that wanna come to Chinatown,

880
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:24,916
dish out Mongolian beef with snow peas?

881
01:04:25,007 --> 01:04:27,919
Well, life's hard. Turns out they can't come.

882
01:04:28,007 --> 01:04:29,440
It's for her kid, man.

883
01:04:30,727 --> 01:04:33,116
Do I bother her with my problems?

884
01:04:34,487 --> 01:04:35,556
Where's the ticket?

885
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,602
Yeah, I hear you got some cracked ribs,
that's gotta sting.

886
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:48,716
We better be careful.

887
01:04:48,807 --> 01:04:51,640
Don't want you bouncing around
too much in here. Might poke a lung.

888
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,681
Oh, I'm sorry. Ls that uncomfortable?

889
01:04:55,967 --> 01:04:57,116
Douche bag.

890
01:04:57,207 --> 01:04:59,084
l don't really care much
for that term "douche bag."

891
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:02,000
People throw it around like crazy these days,
like it's suddenly okay.

892
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:03,839
You know what else people say now?
"Suck it."

893
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:07,318
l was watching TV the other night, 8:30,
middle of prime time.

894
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,682
Kids could be watching. Guy says, "Suck it."

895
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:11,758
Everybody's laughing.

896
01:05:11,847 --> 01:05:13,599
How is that appropriate?

897
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:16,080
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

898
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:18,965
And you're gonna give me
one-word answers,

899
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:20,321
yes or no.

900
01:05:20,407 --> 01:05:22,523
Even a bagboy should be able to handle that.

901
01:05:22,607 --> 01:05:24,882
First question.
Do you know where the ticket is?

902
01:05:26,727 --> 01:05:27,955
Hello!

903
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:54,920
You better give me an answer
or I'm gonna snap your ribs like toothpicks.

904
01:05:57,647 --> 01:06:01,242
Do you know where the ticket is?

905
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:04,518
Will you give it to me?

906
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:07,876
Good boy.

907
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,800
Just get me my bike.

908
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:11,320
Are you negotiating?

909
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:13,398
Yeah. Yeah, and you're outta time.

910
01:06:13,487 --> 01:06:14,636
You might have these assholes in the bag,

911
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:16,957
but you can't lean on me like this
when we get to the hospital.

912
01:06:17,047 --> 01:06:18,765
That's my offer! Get me my bike!

913
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:20,839
I'll get you the ticket.

914
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:23,116
How do we make that happen?

915
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:25,323
Manny. Bring me Manny.

916
01:07:18,127 --> 01:07:19,879
How ya doing, George?

917
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:39,923
Charlie, pull up to the side!

918
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:44,045
Put it back there?

919
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:45,560
Yeah, I'm pushing it through.

920
01:07:45,647 --> 01:07:46,762
Shit.

921
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:10,123
Get out. Come on.

922
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:13,721
Here they come.

923
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:16,917
I'm gonna kick your ass
till Thursday if he doesn't have it.

924
01:08:17,007 --> 01:08:19,475
It's in his bag.
Why do you think I was chasing him?

925
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:21,159
Can I get my bike now, please?

926
01:08:21,247 --> 01:08:22,999
Hey. Hey, fellas.

927
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,166
What's up?

928
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:29,875
- Take this kid inside to get his bike.
- All right.

929
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,162
- But bring him back.
- Will do.

930
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,921
Hello, sir! Rough day, huh?

931
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:40,515
Yeah. Yeah.

932
01:08:56,487 --> 01:08:58,079
Have to ask your permission
to search your bag.

933
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,283
You're not in any trouble at all.
l have reason to believe somebody

934
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:02,835
may have put something in there
without your knowledge.

935
01:09:02,927 --> 01:09:03,916
Okay.

936
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:06,202
- Hey, did you just bring a bike in?
- End of the row.

937
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:07,402
Okay.

938
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:09,917
Hey, you see somebody
hanging on the back of my truck?

939
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:11,406
No, I just got here. Like who?

940
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,797
Like some batshit crazy messenger chick.

941
01:09:13,967 --> 01:09:17,084
l think she was holding on the whole time
l was on the West Side Highway.

942
01:09:18,767 --> 01:09:19,756
Damn.

943
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:28,037
Something I've been looking for
all damn day.

944
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:31,076
- I've had a bit of a rough day myseIf.
- What are you doing?

945
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:42,796
Got it.

946
01:09:43,487 --> 01:09:44,476
Nice!

947
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:47,725
Are there any more compartments?
For what?

948
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:52,675
Over here.

949
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,646
l love you for more than one reason.

950
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:57,319
God damn it!

951
01:09:58,007 --> 01:09:59,201
Have a nice day.

952
01:09:59,287 --> 01:10:02,438
Yeah, just leave it right there!
I'll take care of it, not a problem!

953
01:10:03,727 --> 01:10:04,876
Shit.

954
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:14,357
I'm gonna shred the living shit
outta that thing.

955
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:15,562
Wait.

956
01:10:16,687 --> 01:10:18,006
I'll see you outside.

957
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,958
Hey! Where is the little shit?

958
01:10:20,047 --> 01:10:22,083
Left him back there behind the bikes.
End of the row.

959
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,202
You left him?

960
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:24,925
What, you wanted me to
watch him the whole time?

961
01:10:25,007 --> 01:10:28,317
No, I wanted you to give him the keys
to your car, jackass.

962
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:29,965
Where'd he go?

963
01:10:31,287 --> 01:10:32,686
God damn it.

964
01:10:44,087 --> 01:10:45,520
Bastard!

965
01:10:49,887 --> 01:10:51,764
Can I get some help here?

966
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:58,885
Go round the other side!

967
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:00,400
Outta my way!

968
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:15,564
Hey! Come here!

Cut him off!

Hey! Close the doors!

Holy shit! That was the most fun

You know what to tell him?

Roadrunner.

992
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:54,556
Thought I told you not to call me, Raj.

993
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:55,841
Oh, really?

994
01:14:55,927 --> 01:14:57,360
Hey, it's Phoebe. Who's at the bridge?

995
01:14:58,047 --> 01:14:59,082
Cyclehawk.

996
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:00,876
This is Johnny.

Yeah. I got it. I got it.

01:15:19,487 --> 01:15:20,636
Well, tell him I got it.

01:15:20,727 --> 01:15:21,762
He can send whoever he wants,

Here we go!

1008

You know how they say, "There's enough
to go around for everybody"?

1009
01:16:41,007 --> 01:16:42,599
There isn't.

1010
01:16:44,087 --> 01:16:45,236
Give me the ticket.

1011
01:16:54,287 --> 01:16:57,836
Yeah, you know the thing about these folks?
They never testify.

1012
01:17:00,887 --> 01:17:02,718
Who's to say you didn't lunge at me?

1013
01:17:05,047 --> 01:17:08,084
Give me the ticket.

1014

Yeah, what? What, huh?

1024
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:31,201
I'm a cop, you zipperheads.
What are you going to do?

1025
01:18:39,807 --> 01:18:40,922

1026
01:18:42,607 --> 01:18:44,723

Okay, just gimme a break.
l need to think for a second.

1030
01:20:01,407 --> 01:20:02,396
Thank God.

1031
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,720
Are you okay?

1032
01:20:39,447 --> 01:20:43,406
I'II still take 6th Avenue at rush hour
