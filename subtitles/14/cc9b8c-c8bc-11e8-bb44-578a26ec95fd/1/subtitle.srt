1
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:22,262
They're playing at the Hollywood Bowl
tonight, sold out.

2
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:26,266
We'll be giving away six more tickets
this morning. 75 degrees in Hollywood.

3
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:30,636
You've been listening to an hour of nonstop
power rock 'n' roll, on Holly Power 92.

4
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:32,805
- There's more.
- At the top of the hour...

5
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:35,308
here in the Valley, it's
a balmy 83 degrees.

6
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,010
Gotta go, but first...

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,746
here's the story of my life.

8
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:04,890
I don't want to, like, start a family.

9
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,260
I'd get all puffed out to the max
and all, for sure!

10
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,864
Oh, God, gag me. How could you?

11
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:14,032
Sure, I'd be freaking...

12
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,935
I'd be scarfing up everything in sight.

13
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,271
I'm sure. I don't know.

14
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:23,108
I'd get so fat and all,
and what would happen to my zits?

15
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:25,143
They can get so grody.

16
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,714
And besides, it's totally
gnarly birth control.

17
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,150
He's not so awesome.

18
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:33,251
Awesome's not the word for Brad.

19
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:35,654
- Oh, I'm sure.
- He's okay, I guess.

20
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,456
Who am I kidding?

21
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:40,426
He makes my mouth water.

22
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,662
Brad'll be at my party tonight.

23
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:46,965
Great, that'll attract every girl
west of Van Nuys Boulevard.

24
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:48,834
Your place will be packed.

25
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:51,871
Okay, so he's awesome!

26
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:56,675
God, Julie, don't be so greedy.
You know, save some for the rest of us.

27
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:00,646
Tommy is such a hunk, I can't stand it.

28
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:02,948
I mean, he is so bitchin'.

29
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:05,951
I can't even believe
you'd give Brad the time of day.

30
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,387
But Tommy can be such a dork, you know?

31
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,991
Like, he's got the bod,
but his brains are bad news.

32
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:15,827
But he is bitchin'.
You really are so lucky, Julie.

33
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:19,464
I know, but we've been going together
so long now.

34
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:23,635
I'm beginning to think I'm a piece of
furniture or something, like an old chair.

35
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:25,504
Total bad news.

36
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:28,306
I definitely need something new.

37
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,310
Bags off at home and
hit the beach, okay?

38
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:32,510
Let's do that.

39
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,146
- Sounds good.
- Julie, like...

40
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:35,647
I hate these escalators.

41
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:38,417
Guys, we won't have time
to get ready for my party.

42
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:39,951
Yes, we will.

43
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,724
What a surprise finding you here.

44
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,426
Should I be at home,
waiting for the phone to ring?

45
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:51,230
I could grow old and prune up,
waiting for that.

46
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,798
Funny. What's your problem?

47
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:56,134
What's my problem?
Try two days and no phone calls.

48
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,738
I'll see you guys at the bus.

49
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:02,074
- Okay.
- That's all right.

50
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:07,412
I'm totally not in love with you
anymore, Tommy.

51
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,448
I mean, it's so boring.

52
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,583
Here.

53
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:19,258
Not too cool, Julie. I won't be bummed out.

54
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,462
Who else is there?
No other Val dude can touch me.

55
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:26,498
She must be really freaking out.

56
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:29,101
- I want a corn dog.
- I want a pizza.

57
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:32,037
- Diet Pepsi with French fries.
- Those are totally fattening!

58
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:33,138
I got it.

59
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:36,241
- I'm sure!
- Diet Pepsi's diet.

60
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:41,413
It'll be a great party night.
Everyone will be there.

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,782
Pass on cotillion just this once, okay?

62
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:46,718
My mom would kill me
if she found out I'd skipped out on it.

63
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:50,822
Look, this is the social event
of the season. Don't be dull.

64
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:55,861
- Where does she live?
- 23727 Sierra Vista.

65
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:00,665
I'm sure. Move.

66
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,869
The best guys will be there.
It'll be totally hot.

67
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,272
- That guy is so cute!
- He is.

68
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,007
- Look at him!
- He smiled.

69
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:11,042
- You guys....
- His hair...

70
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:13,845
- Look how hairy that guy's back is.
- Gross!

71
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:16,615
The guy has fur all over his face, too.

72
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,784
My God!

73
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:20,385
What a hunk!

74
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:23,855
Oh, God, check out those pecs!

75
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:27,058
I'd go for that in a minute. For sure.

76
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:28,526
He's hot!

77
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:31,663
- He's my kind of guy.
- Aren't they all?

78
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:35,200
Most of them are.
They didn't have corn dogs, so I got...

79
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,901
I hate....

80
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:41,106
Hey, man, 23727 Sierra Vista.

81
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:44,309
It's a party. It is going to be amazing.
I've seen the chicks.

82
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:47,312
I know about these things.
I got a feeling about this.

83
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,681
It's going to be hot. I'm telling you.

84
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,749
And it's in the Valley.

85
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,120
What?

86
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,024
- The party's in the Valley.
- I don't want to go to the Valley.

87
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:03,561
- Trust me, I know...
- I don't want to go to the Valley.

88
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,496
I'm not in the mood to go there.

89
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:10,068
Come on, Julie. You know Loryn
won't let her mom wait for us.

90
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:13,238
She'll want to pounce
on the first available bod.

91
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:16,608
God. Hey, do you think
she does everything she says?

92
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:20,579
I don't know. She'll get in a lot of
trouble, though, if she doesn't watch out.

93
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,247
I think she does.

94
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:25,516
Who could make up,
"That stuff tastes like Clorox"?

95
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:27,786
God, gross me out!

96
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,921
I don't know.
I think she's lonely, you know?

97
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,023
When does she have the time?

98
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,427
- She's got problems.
- Yeah. Hormones, I guess.

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,731
- No, that's when you grow a mustache.
- Puke! Gross!

100
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:42,433
I don't know,
it's up to us to look out for her.

101
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,370
She is our friend.
She'd do the same thing for us.

102
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,972
I guess.

103
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:49,174
Okay.

104
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:54,145
- Hold still.
- God, what am I going to do?

105
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,948
Tommy's going to be there.
You know how he is.

106
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,717
He's not going to appreciate
me talking to Brad.

107
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:02,387
Get real. You're not
going through with this, are you?

108
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,657
I'm so sure! Brad's totally hot.

109
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,692
I think he's totally not.

110
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,329
- God, I'm so nervous.
- Okay, let's go!

111
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:18,336
- We're taking off now, guys.
- Don't you two look great!

112
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:21,239
Stacey, if I were 20
years younger, honey....

113
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:24,609
God, Dad! I won't be too late, I'm sure.

114
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,611
We don't want to pressure you, dear.

115
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:29,380
Just let us hear from you by next Tuesday,
okay, honey?

116
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:32,917
I'm not going away on a peace march
or something heavy like that, Pop.

117
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:36,454
- I can dig the scene. No sweat.
- I have to be home by 1:00.

118
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,823
We try to give Julie all
the space she needs.

119
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,058
I know, Mom.

120
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:42,994
- 'Bye. Have a good time.
- 'Bye.

121
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:46,864
- Bye-bye.
- Have a good time.

122
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,307
Sarah, do you know
how much she looks like you?

123
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:59,177
I mean, you were just her age
when I met you.

124
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:02,013
Do I still look that way?

125
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:04,082
Better.

126
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,519
But things were sure a lot wilder then.

127
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,725
Different priorities, that's all.

128
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,227
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.

129
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,065
I tell you what.
You spend the night at my house, okay?

130
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,067
We'll take his mother's car....

131
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:25,403
Sounds good.

132
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:29,474
- Forget about her, Tommy.
- Don't worry about it.

133
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:38,349
Brad?

134
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:44,088
- Great party.
- It's all right.

135
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,057
Do you like the music?

136
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:47,858
It's okay.

137
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:52,063
- Have you tried the sushi yet?
- No. I haven't made it in there.

138
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:01,539
It won't to be easy. Anytime
you want to come back, you let me know.

139
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,974
I'll think about it.

140
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,110
- I told you to forget it.
- You'll be back.

141
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,378
Yeah, right.

142
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,154
She can't live without me.

143
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,063
He's totally awesome!

144
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:29,733
- Who, dear?
- Skip! Mom, you're not listening to me.

145
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,805
Skip's a really nice guy,
and I want him to like me...

146
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,207
so I just want to make sure....

147
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:39,143
Is there something I shouldn't know
that I should know?

148
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:40,545
Of course there is.

149
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:49,887
You're right. He is cute.

150
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,491
- I was hoping you'd come.
- Oh, yeah?

151
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:54,558
Yeah.

152
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,029
What about that one?

153
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,365
- He dresses like a dork.
- Yeah, but he's cute!

154
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:02,166
How can you like a dork?

155
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,169
Don't look now. Guess who?

156
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,573
Hello.

157
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:10,241
Good-bye.

158
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,244
God, he's such a total pukeoid.

159
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:16,647
He's just really bitchin'. You'll see.

160
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:20,151
Why don't you take this out now?
The guests are waiting for some food.

161
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:27,892
What was that all about?

162
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,391
I'm only her stepmother,
and since Jim died,

163
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,755
she's been kind of
competitive with me.

164
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:02,092
Spring-up?

165
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:07,331
Freak me out, it's him!

166
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:09,133
- Who?
- The guy with the brown hair.

167
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,368
Hi, Skip.

168
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,506
Don't be so obvious with boys.

169
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,410
- Hi, Skip.
- Hi, Suzi.

170
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,412
I'd like you to meet my mother.

171
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:24,682
- Hi, Mrs. Brent. Nice to meet you.
- Call me Beth.

172
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,289
It's nice to meet you.

173
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:35,025
- Skip! Lyle.
- How do you do?

174
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:39,830
Honey, the phone's ringing.

175
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:42,899
Come on, Skip. Let's go dance.

176
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:49,539
- Look at who Tommy's with.
- Who cares?

177
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,208
Come on.

178
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:53,811
He's totally juvenile, Stacey.

179
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:15,632
- Hi, Tommy.
- Is it?

180
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,335
- Yes, it is.
- What?

181
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:21,138
The most beautiful girl in the world.

182
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:25,109
- What's the matter with you, dude?
- I think I'm falling in love.

183
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:31,715
Come on. What about Julie?

184
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:34,251
That's a real tragedy. Dumped.

185
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:37,321
Jilted. Right in the toilet.
My heart's broken.

186
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,324
I'm sure you got to be drunk.

187
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:43,760
That's what I've always enjoyed about you.

188
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:46,463
You're perceptive.
You know how to read a guy.

189
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,602
- I need help.
- Yeah?

190
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:55,639
I was wondering
if you'd step into my office?

191
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,643
God!

192
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,580
- No.
- Don't worry about it.

193
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:05,950
Oh, Jesus.

194
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,618
Wait, I got a great idea.

195
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,637
Let's do it.

196
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,676
Okay, smart guy. We're here. Now what?

197
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:34,645
Mingle. Blend in.

198
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:37,247
Right.

199
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:56,333
- Can I pick 'em, or what? Check it out.
- Why don't you lower it?

200
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,969
You don't need to raise
up a flag or nothing.

201
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:00,804
Just looking for action.

202
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,777
Let's check out the eats.

203
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:13,117
What've we got going here, a bait shop?

204
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,554
It's sushi, don't you know? This is tuna.

205
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,357
This is flying fish eggs,
and that's sea urchin.

206
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:22,559
This is pistachio paste, isn't it?

207
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,535
Come on, Fred, dig in.

208
00:15:33,103 --> 00:15:35,405
I think I'll just get something to drink.

209
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:38,175
Wait.

210
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:40,677
This is not right.

211
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:45,249
- How can this not be right?
- 'Cause what about Julie?

212
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,418
That's over.

213
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:50,521
She tossed me out.

214
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:57,894
Don't penalize me for what she did.
I'm the one that got hurt. I am.

215
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:08,305
- I've always thought about you.
- You have?

216
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,944
I thought about you all day.

217
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:18,515
- You want to dance?
- Ln another life.

218
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:21,484
I didn't either. I was just taking a poll.

219
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:23,853
Fred, I didn't know you were this good.

220
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:26,756
- At least I'm trying.
- What is this, points for effort?

221
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,426
I told you this place
was going to be a waste.

222
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:33,530
This place sucks.

223
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:35,965
- Well, well.
- What?

224
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:44,040
- Hot. Very hot.
- Where? Which one?

225
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:49,612
They're staring right at us.

226
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,282
Gross! Let's move.

227
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:56,753
Wait, let's see what happens.

228
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,190
I'm sure! Tell me all about it.
I'm going to talk to Ralphie.

229
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,693
- Bad luck, Fred. Yours is leaving.
- What do you mean, mine's leaving?

230
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:06,062
- She winked at you, didn't she?
- She did?

231
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:08,031
Yeah, don't let her get away.

232
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:18,575
- Hello.
- Hello.

233
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:22,545
Having a good time?

234
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,314
I'm trying.

235
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:26,315
That's good.

236
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,553
- What are you doing here?
- It's a party.

237
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:33,490
I know it's a party, but who invited you?

238
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:38,395
You mean you have to be invited?
That explains it.

239
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:40,797
- What?
- Why everyone is dressed so weird.

240
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,833
If I'd been invited,
I'd have known this was a costume party.

241
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:45,035
Right.

242
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:52,108
- I saw you once before, you know.
- Where?

243
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,911
At the beach.

244
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:57,714
That was you?

245
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,385
Do you think a girl should pet
on the first date?

246
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:04,487
Who are you, Bozo the Clown?

247
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:07,190
What's your sign?

248
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:12,162
Is this gonna mean we're going together?

249
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:13,329
What?

250
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:17,133
Is this gonna mean we're going together?

251
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:20,536
No.

252
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:23,773
What?

253
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,845
I think it means
you're a pretty lousy friend...

254
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:32,682
messing around with your friend's boyfriend
while he's in a bad way.

255
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:36,953
But I'll tell you what.

256
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,022
- What?
- I won't tell anybody if you don't.

257
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:53,202
Get out....

258
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:04,480
- I never said that.
- Did you?

259
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:06,916
- That wasn't you. I'm sorry.
- You know, football.

260
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:09,719
- I'm not playing this year.
- That was Rick.

261
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:12,288
Who's Rick?

262
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,758
How you doing, Tommy?

263
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:18,294
- Is she good?
- Oh, man.

264
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,496
She's a four-star lay, good buddy.

265
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,770
How's your mother?

266
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:29,538
She's dead.

267
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:43,185
And the wind blows it up.

268
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:44,621
No, I want....

269
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,226
Why don't you get out of here?

270
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,595
You make me get out of here.

271
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:55,665
Crazy is the word...

272
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:00,036
Get up!

273
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,673
- You have nothing, faggot!
- Tommy! Stop it!

274
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:15,017
- Fuck you!
- Get the hell out of here!

275
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:25,628
- I don't want to hurt you guys.
- You get out...

276
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:27,263
Fuck you!

277
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,333
Jerk!

278
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,102
Kiss my ass!

279
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,305
You're good, man.

280
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:39,141
What were you doing in there,
kissing girls goodnight?

281
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,543
- Listen...
- Don't!

282
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:41,977
- I won't.
- Good.

283
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,859
That chick, Julie, she's truly dazzling.

284
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:01,964
Yep.

285
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:04,400
But she's not one of ours.

286
00:21:22,552 --> 00:21:24,120
Hey, what the hell?

287
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:27,656
Dickhead, what are you trying to do,
get us killed?

288
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,727
What the hell's the matter with you?
Shit, this is my mother's car.

289
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:34,129
Who the fuck was that guy?

290
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:38,267
And I was doing all right with that chick.
Who the fuck does he think he is?

291
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:40,669
Maybe he was her boyfriend.

292
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,440
Nobody is going to tell me
who I can score with!

293
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:48,411
I want this chick, she wants me,
so fuck it. We're going back.

294
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:55,718
My mom will shit
if she knows you're driving this car.

295
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:59,421
I really don't give a shit
what your mother thinks.

296
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:39,428
It's bad enough you got to be here.
Be far worse if I got the same treatment.

297
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:43,065
Wait a second. What are we doing here?
I don't have a death wish.

298
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:56,178
- They're cute, aren't they?
- Yeah, so swell.

299
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,461
- What if somebody comes?
- Don't worry about it.

300
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,402
Somebody could come.

301
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:55,804
I told you.

302
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:57,106
Hurry up in there!

303
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:59,875
- They can wait.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.

304
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:02,878
- Take a hike.
- Doug.

305
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:03,946
- Come here.
- No!

306
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:05,314
Okay. Lose out.

307
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:08,617
- I'm sure.
- Come on, hurry up.

308
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:11,586
I'm hurrying. Meet me later?

309
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:14,288
Will you?

310
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:19,027
- Creep.
- Thanks a lot, man.

311
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,972
- I can't believe he did it.
- I can.

312
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:32,941
I can't. But guess who's looking at you?

313
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:44,486
So I said, "Oh, my God,
I just can't touch that thing."

314
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:46,288
Oh, God, it looked so....

315
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:50,192
So what? Tell me.

316
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:52,227
Awesome.

317
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:55,063
It's like shaking hands
with your best friend.

318
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:57,032
Only, like, real fast.

319
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:59,468
Come on, let's go.

320
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,652
How many is it we've had?

321
00:25:16,718 --> 00:25:19,154
- You getting high?
- Golly! Where did you get that?

322
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:22,224
- I'm making some lines here for you.
- Oh, wow!

323
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:25,393
How is it? Okay?

324
00:25:28,097 --> 00:25:30,765
Hey, you're gonna lose your nose. Look out.

325
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:16,211
- Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing here?

326
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:18,346
Do you have a death wish or something?

327
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,849
- That's what Fred said.
- Fred said?

328
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,050
Never mind.

329
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,488
You live around here?

330
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:30,158
This is very strange.

331
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,362
- What are you doing back here?
- I forgot my comb.

332
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,932
Really, now?

333
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:41,103
To tell you the truth,
I thought that maybe you and I could....

334
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,406
We could what?

335
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:47,975
We could get out of here.

336
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:53,081
I don't think you'd be any more welcome
down there, right now.

337
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:55,383
Let's leave the party.

338
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,787
- I'm so sure.
- Cool.

339
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:01,690
I'll meet you out front.

340
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,292
Wait a minute. Where are we gonna go?

341
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:07,829
I don't care.

342
00:27:10,165 --> 00:27:12,367
- What are we gonna do?
- Anything.

343
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,707
- Okay, but I have to bring my best friend.
- That's fine.

344
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,711
I'll be waiting for you.

345
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,496
God, I don't want to go! I told you.

346
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:44,399
- It's going to be fun.
- Lt is not going to be fun.

347
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,701
They're not even here.

348
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:48,236
Let's go back.

349
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:50,539
- I know they're around here.
- Where?

350
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,740
- Right there.
- Hey, come here.

351
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:56,678
Oh, no. Not those guys.
They're hoods. Juvenile delinquents.

352
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:58,579
- No.
- You've lost your mind.

353
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,281
- No.
- Look at them.

354
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,386
The rating scale is okay.

355
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,788
- Do this for me.
- I am freaking out!

356
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:09,390
- No.
- Come on.

357
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:13,033
Hi. I'm Fred. I like
tacos and '71 Cabernet,

358
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,054
and my favorite
color is magenta.

359
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:20,902
- I'm Julie, and this is Stacey.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

360
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,271
I'm simply going to freak out and die!

361
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:25,440
- Would you get in the car?
- God!

362
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:29,810
I will pay whatever it takes to make sure
nobody breathes a word of this.

363
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:31,479
I'll be totally bummed out...

364
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:34,549
if anyone on Earth, outside this car,
finds out about this.

365
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:37,919
God, where is your sense of adventure?
Will you shut up?

366
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:41,923
I personally guarantee you, you will
have the time of your life tonight.

367
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,526
- You'll see things you've only read about.
- I'm sure.

368
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:52,233
I'm freezing.

369
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:56,037
- Please put the top up?
- Hope you don't mind if I change...

370
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:58,415
This is the last time
I take you anywhere.

371
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm sure.

372
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:04,045
- I like this song.
- Oh, God, I hate this song.

373
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:06,047
I hate this music.

374
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:28,436
Look!

375
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:35,677
No way, Bob!

376
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:16,684
Sweet cheeks and velvet thighs.

377
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,053
Hey, Harvey!

378
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:24,058
- I thought you were getting the Mohawk!
- Nah, I wussed out.

379
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:27,595
I like this song.

380
00:30:34,568 --> 00:30:38,872
Hey, Rico! What? You didn't! No way, man.

381
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:42,309
You didn't do that. I'll talk to you later.

382
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:12,506
Rad! What's doing?

383
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:16,144
- Check out the cool wheels on that.
- Shit.

384
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,716
- Sid Vicious lives.
- I'm not getting out of this car.

385
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:25,085
All right. But when they attack the car,
save the radio.

386
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,596
Hey, baby, why don't you get rid
of the bum, and meet me later?

387
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:44,038
I don't want to go in here.

388
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,043
- What's doing?
- Nothing going.

389
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:36,090
Hey, Sean, so what's your salami like?

390
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:43,397
- Is this your hangout?
- This is my home away from home.

391
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,799
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yeah.

392
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:52,806
You guys want something to drink?
I got some friends I want to see. Let's go.

393
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,446
I don't even wanna know
what's on this seat.

394
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:19,333
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. I go to Hollywood High.

395
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,968
Me, too.

396
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,537
Oh, my God. Don't you have a straw?

397
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,939
Totally out of touch with civilization.

398
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:33,647
This is what we call living on the edge.

399
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:36,783
You don't have places like this
in the Valley, do you?

400
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,954
- No, we're just not into....
- Slumming it.

401
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,490
So what do you do over there that's hot?

402
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:47,093
We go to normal parties,
we go to normal places.

403
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:51,065
Buy nice, new clothes.

404
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,335
That's no different from what we do.

405
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:58,071
It's the way we do things
that makes the difference.

406
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,741
I guess so.

407
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:15,089
You know, these guys
all look sick, or something.

408
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:19,025
- You'd all look healthier with a tan.
- You won't catch anything here.

409
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,661
This is the real world.

410
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:24,865
It's not fresh and clean,
like a television show.

411
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:27,868
I always thought
the Valley was real enough for me.

412
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:30,704
Do you think they could
crank this noise up louder?

413
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,938
Noise?

414
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,043
This music's got emotion, power.

415
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:38,745
That techno-rock
you guys listen to is gutless.

416
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:40,113
I'm sure.

417
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,985
Fred, that's my leg!

418
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,056
You guys think
you're so different, don't you?

419
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:52,325
- We are. We're ourselves.
- And we're not?

420
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:55,428
You're like her
and all the rest of her friends.

421
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,697
You're all fucking programmed.

422
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:02,469
- So what does it take to be so free?
- That's a good question.

423
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,276
So when can I see you again?

424
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,212
- Thank you.
- Really, Randy...

425
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:16,183
why don't you wait until
the end of the evening to say these things?

426
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:20,153
It's the way I feel. It's what I want.

427
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:22,756
All right, we're going to play a song.

428
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,992
It's called A Million Miles Away.

429
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:30,130
I'm here with you now.

430
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,365
I know.

431
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:41,375
It's like I can't explain it, you know?

432
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:45,212
It's like my brains won't stop going.

433
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,515
You know?

434
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:52,119
Yeah?

435
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:01,661
It's like I feel connected to you somehow.

436
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,964
It's like I'm....

437
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:10,803
It's like we're linked, or something.
I'm starting to sound like my parents.

438
00:36:55,815 --> 00:37:00,287
Steve, honey, come on. Stop worrying.
She's going to be all right.

439
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,490
Remember our night in the cemetery?

440
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:19,172
God! You are so weird. Go away.

441
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,341
My little pickle.

442
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,878
My darling.

443
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:30,150
- This is so embarrassing.
- I think you're cute.

444
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,052
God!

445
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:56,876
Look, I just hope I can see you again.

446
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:58,945
Why not? I thought you liked me.

447
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:01,114
For sure.

448
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:03,583
Well?

449
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:07,620
My friends will freak, you know?

450
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:10,523
None of us have had a dude
outside of school.

451
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,326
Fuck 'em. Be the first one on your block.

452
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:16,296
Do you always have to talk like that?

453
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,867
- My darling.
- You're so weird.

454
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,036
I want to see you tomorrow.

455
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:26,939
You can't. I have to work,
if you can believe that.

456
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:29,141
It's so uncool.

457
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:32,612
Where do you work?

458
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,681
In my parents' store.

459
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:38,551
- What kind of a store?
- It's a store, you know?

460
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:41,521
I know, a store. What do you sell?

461
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:43,689
Health foods.

462
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,693
That's cool.

463
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:49,729
It's not. It's so uncool.

464
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:53,065
Why couldn't they own
a Pizza Hut, or something?

465
00:38:58,204 --> 00:38:59,272
God!

466
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:13,052
- I have to go home now.
- You don't.

467
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,489
Come on!

468
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:33,439
- My parents must be up, I'm sure.
- Are you going to get into trouble?

469
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,274
They're pretty cool.

470
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:38,477
But I've never done this before.

471
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:41,514
I better go.

472
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,365
I want to see you tomorrow.

473
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:14,380
- Julie, is that you?
- Yeah, Mom, it's me. Sorry.

474
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,416
We have been worried sick about you.

475
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,352
Where have you been,
that you'd have to stay out all night?

476
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:23,623
- I don't think I want to hear this.
- We have no secrets in this family.

477
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:27,927
We know you're at an age now
where boys are more important...

478
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,730
and nature plays its little part
in the scheme of life.

479
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,167
- What am I talking about? I'm sure...
- God! Get serious.

480
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,168
I was out all night, but I didn't...

481
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:38,771
- You don't have to.... Cool it.
- Julie, listen.

482
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:43,142
What your father is trying to say, dear,
is whatever you do is all right with us...

483
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,678
as long as it doesn't hurt you,
or anyone else.

484
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:47,179
- Right.
- Wait, Mom, I just...

485
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:50,183
You see, we just want you
to be careful and responsible.

486
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:52,418
Your mother and I worry about you, honey.

487
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:56,689
It's not fair, with all the creepy-crawlers
out there, and everything.

488
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,225
- I'm just going to bed now.
- Wait a minute.

489
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,094
We were young once.
Your mother still is. We understand.

490
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:04,831
- This isn't the Age of Aquarius.
- I would that it were.

491
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,733
Why don't you just punish me
like Stacey's parents do?

492
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,901
Bad karma, dear.

493
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:23,483
- Guess what?
- What?

494
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,919
Skip asked for my phone number.
God, I hope he calls.

495
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:30,623
- Fasten your seat belt.
- God, I hate these things.

496
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:32,925
They totally ruin the crease in my pants.

497
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,928
Make sure you're in park,
then turn the key.

498
00:41:36,095 --> 00:41:38,831
Where did you guys disappear to
the other night?

499
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,167
Let Julie concentrate.

500
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,003
Let Julie drive.
You don't want to be part of the pavement.

501
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:47,439
I have the right to know. It was my party.

502
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,675
Suzi, I mean, I didn't feel good.

503
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:52,444
I almost barfed from all that sushi,
you know?

504
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:54,046
And Julie took me home.

505
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:55,547
Cut the chatter, girls.

506
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,883
I want you to know you're my best friends.

507
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,586
- Eyes forward, Julie.
- Tell us quick, who is he?

508
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,622
- He was at the party.
- Eyes forward, mouth shut.

509
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,874
Who is it? Brad was
there the whole night...

510
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:06,926
Who is it, Julie?

511
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:09,128
- Randy.
- Who's Randy?

512
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:13,632
- He's the most awesome dude ever.
- Where was I when he was around?

513
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,434
Where were you?

514
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:19,071
- You don't mean that guy...
- Cut the conversation, girls.

515
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,006
He's that guy from Hollywood.

516
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,842
He came back for Stacey and me...

517
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:25,578
and took us back over the hill.
We had a super time.

518
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:28,080
I mean, your party was super and all.

519
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,649
Man, he's just like trippin'-dicular,
you know?

520
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,486
- Wasn't he, Stacey?
- You die, Richman.

521
00:42:33,686 --> 00:42:36,889
Straighten out!
You can't go through there. Stop!

522
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:42,327
You'll be in big trouble if this gets
around. What if Tommy finds out?

523
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,698
- So what?
- You've got a reputation to protect.

524
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:47,233
Don't we all?

525
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:53,538
Fail.

526
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,242
Dump the Sohio at 34 and one eighth.

527
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:00,112
Sure. Did you net in the cocoa futures?

528
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,215
- Today would be great.
- Delivery.

529
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:04,483
Hold on.

530
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:08,287
Come on in. The gate's open.
I'll get right back to you.

531
00:43:15,127 --> 00:43:16,395
Hi, Mrs. Brent.

532
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:20,565
- Skip. From the party.
- I know.

533
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:23,335
Skip. From the party.

534
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:27,239
Don't stand there holding those.
Put them down.

535
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,541
Put them down there.

536
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:38,617
- You had a good time, I hope?
- Ma'am?

537
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:42,254
- You enjoyed yourself at the party?
- Yes, ma'am.

538
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:48,861
I'm a little bit disappointed in you.

539
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:53,665
- Ma'am?
- We talked quite a bit at the party...

540
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,535
and I watched you....

541
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:01,373
I believe in being direct. How about you?

542
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:07,846
Just tell me exactly what you're thinking.

543
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:11,717
Say, "Beth, l...."

544
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,089
Okay.

545
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:25,864
It's no accident
that I'm the one delivering the groceries.

546
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,602
That's a start.

547
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,272
I guess so.

548
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:38,576
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Sure.

549
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:40,412
I mean, no.

550
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,782
I've still got a few
more deliveries to make.

551
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:46,384
I've really got to get back to work.

552
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,220
That was quick.

553
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,792
I've got a little tip for you, Skip.

554
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,795
You got to be kidding.

555
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:58,464
Plastics.

556
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,538
The time to do something
is when the time is right.

557
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:13,679
What time is it?

558
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,955
Actually, it's almost time
for Suzi to get home.

559
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,795
- I guess I see what you mean.
- Good.

560
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,933
If nothing else, we've learned that.

561
00:45:39,638 --> 00:45:41,239
Don't be a stranger.

562
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:44,209
'Bye.

563
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,347
- 'Bye.
- See ya.

564
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:51,950
See ya.

565
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:56,421
A Red Zinger tea.

566
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:59,424
A Bombay Avocado Delight.

567
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,995
And a cup of wheatgrass juice.

568
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,831
Okay. Would you like some bean sprouts?

569
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:09,767
Steve, we're out of the A, the B-12,
and the D, and the C.

570
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:12,471
- I think there's some B-1 2 in the back.
- Okay.

571
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:15,640
- What?
- There go the water buffaloes.

572
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,976
They are kind of old, dear.

573
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:21,079
Beg your pardon.
I got these for Woodstock, remember?

574
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,947
Or was it the march on Washington?

575
00:46:23,015 --> 00:46:26,117
That was almost 14 years ago,
and you were right the first time.

576
00:46:26,218 --> 00:46:29,454
- You got the Earth shoes for Washington.
- Right, the Earth shoes.

577
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,456
- Are you sure?
- Positive, dear.

578
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:33,925
Remember? You were going to do
a lot of walking?

579
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,794
You're right.

580
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,563
I think I'll go get the B-12.

581
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:45,870
God, this stuff is so gross.
How could people eat that?

582
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:48,940
Because it isn't greasy,
doesn't mean it's bad for you, dodo.

583
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,074
It's yuck.

584
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,443
You're a yuck.

585
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,114
Oh, my God, I'm going to die!

586
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:02,120
- What are you doing? Are you all right?
- I'm humiliated to the max.

587
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

588
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:13,064
- Randy, this is my dad.
- Steve Richman.

589
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,335
- What's happening? How's it going?
- Fine. How are you doing?

590
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:18,603
Great.

591
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:20,572
- That's great.
- He wants a sandwich.

592
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:22,374
Right, okay.

593
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,945
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

594
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,981
- But why here?
- What's wrong with this place?

595
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:31,582
This place is gross.

596
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,019
All this stuff that tastes like nothing,
but is so good for you.

597
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,588
What about the sprouts?

598
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,258
Did you get in trouble the other night?

599
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,194
- For what?
- Coming home so late.

600
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,729
- No.
- Didn't your parents find out?

601
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,898
Yeah, they were waiting up.

602
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,900
- Don't they care?
- Sure they care...

603
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:52,103
but I'm supposed to develop
into my own person, you know?

604
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,141
That sounds good.

605
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,209
How about a Coke?

606
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,746
Sorry, my dad said
they supported the war effort...

607
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,181
and it rots the enzymes in your stomach.

608
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:08,586
- That sounds good to me.
- Right.

609
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,794
- Let's get out of here.
- Don't you have to work?

610
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,496
I've got flexible hours.

611
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,232
See you, Dad.

612
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:22,901
Bye-bye, sweetie.

613
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,737
Come up with any new gizmos?

614
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:28,339
We got some new stuff.
You can take a look at it.

615
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,174
Honey, where's Julie?

616
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:33,111
- She left with Randy.
- Who's Randy?

617
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:37,449
I think he's that dude
she was out with the other night.

618
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:40,552
Do you think
we should talk to her about this?

619
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:43,755
- I don't know.
- Maybe I should talk to her.

620
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,534
So, where's Julie?

621
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,838
We haven't seen much of her
in the last week.

622
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:23,541
She doesn't have time
for her friends anymore.

623
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,277
I can't believe that.
You guys were such good friends.

624
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:29,380
- What's with her?
- It's more like who's with her.

625
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,349
I mean, this guy, Randy,
is filling her head with air.

626
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:36,053
I nominated her for class rep,
and she wasn't even there.

627
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,355
If she'd listen to me,
I'd set her straight.

628
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,791
You girls are her friends, you should try.

629
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:44,561
She dumped me. Far be it for
me to interfere with her life.

630
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:48,632
You're right, Tommy.
She did dump you and your advice, buddy.

631
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:53,003
Go on and laugh. I still love that girl.
I know how to make her happy....

632
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,309
This geek that she's with
could scar her for life.

633
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:00,444
God. For life?

634
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:04,481
No. Come on, Suzi.

635
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,285
What is it with Loryn?

636
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:34,011
What's going on? Way to go, spaz!

637
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:37,481
- I didn't mean to do it, spaz.
- Get lost.

638
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:44,488
She's always into everything, you know?

639
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,357
Suzi, it's a total bummer
when you're young...

640
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,726
and you don't even know why you're here.

641
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,161
Yeah, I mean....

642
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,197
Okay, this one is so tubular.

643
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,334
Suzi, pass the chips, will you?

644
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,937
Can you, like, grow some more zits?

645
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,875
No, but I thought
maybe I could borrow some of yours, okay?

646
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,246
My thighs just grow, looking at that stuff.

647
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,084
- What can you do?
- You chew them up and spit them out.

648
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:15,752
How gross!

649
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,288
People do that to stay skinny.
It's very serious.

650
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,492
Cindy Boo lost 90 pounds,
and even, like, scarfed on ice cream.

651
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:25,596
- Are you serious? No way.
- Yeah, you know, like, splurge and purge?

652
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,931
Or, like, scarf and barf.

653
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,735
- Very immature.
- I'll start my diet tomorrow.

654
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:35,739
You better watch out.
Randy might like the Hollywood lean look.

655
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,542
Yeah, but blimps don't get to go
with Tommy.

656
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,643
Who?

657
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,544
- Tommy.
- Who?

658
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:45,816
Fuck him.

659
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,488
Girls, we must fuck him.

660
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,427
What is that little brat doing?

661
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,030
- Give me the chips.
- Sorry.

662
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:11,708
- Not too cool, all right, Peggy?
- I am, too, cool.

663
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,144
Your mom is so bitchin', Suzi.

664
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:17,180
Put that back, Loryn.
You're too small for that.

665
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,617
I am not too small. I
look totally hot in this.

666
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,854
No man could resist my....

667
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,223
- What do you call it?
- Your tits.

668
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,592
Put that stuff back.

669
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,713
Do you think Randy
will like me in this?

670
00:55:33,738 --> 00:55:36,357
Yeah, if it was made
out of black leather.

671
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:41,705
Tommy's going to look real good
after six grody bus rides into Hollywood.

672
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,675
Like, all those sweaty bods. Barf me out.

673
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:47,411
You'll really get off
hearing about all the parties.

674
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,679
What do you mean?

675
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:51,948
Because you'll never be able to go to any,
as long as you got Randy.

676
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,217
Don't you think they have parties
over there?

677
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,052
Where, at the zoo?

678
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,755
You can just kiss class rep good-bye.

679
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,324
Big deal, okay?

680
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:09,166
Hello?

681
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,869
Who is this? Hi, Skip.

682
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,904
I was hoping you'd call.

683
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,474
My mom said she saw you the other day.

684
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,645
- She did?
- Yeah. She thinks you're all right.

685
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,946
She does?

686
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,450
- Tell him to come over.
- Go for it!

687
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,353
Why don't you come over?

688
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,960
My mom is gone.

689
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,429
Oh, yeah? For how long?

690
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,931
For most of the night.

691
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,301
Maybe all night. She's out on a date.

692
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,505
What do you say?

693
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,674
I can't.

694
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,478
My mom's got a lot of stuff
for me to do around here.

695
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,146
I was just calling to say hi and all.

696
00:56:57,246 --> 00:56:59,682
You know, see what you're up to.

697
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,318
- I'll talk to you later, okay?
- When?

698
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,855
Jeez, I don't know. Later, I guess.

699
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,157
Okay.

700
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,929
Okay. Good-bye.

701
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,201
A date.

702
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:22,005
- Do you think he likes me?
- He called you, didn't he?

703
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:25,141
You know the type. He's shy.

704
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,244
I could die. He's so buff.

705
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:32,782
- I know he likes you.
- Like the way Randy likes you?

706
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,717
For sure, Stacey.

707
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:38,454
You know, Julie, you can
kiss all the bitchin' Val dudes good-bye.

708
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,256
Like I really care.

709
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,461
I hear there's something really grody
about the air in Hollywood.

710
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:48,197
And the guys, they only get to be that big.

711
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:49,966
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

712
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:54,237
- What's the biggest one you've ever seen?
- Like in the National Geographic, or what?

713
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,638
No, in your hand.

714
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,241
Damn it. God!

715
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:03,272
Hello?

716
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,944
It's me, Skip.

717
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,582
I'm just returning one of Suzi's books.

718
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:23,025
Jesus Christ.

719
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,632
What do you think?

720
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:08,304
Everybody thinks
Tommy is so tubular and all, you know?

721
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,172
So you think I should pick Tommy.

722
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:16,011
What I mean is, if you were
to get back together with Tommy...

723
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,248
do you think things would be better?

724
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,651
You mean I should pick Randy?

725
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:24,453
I don't know about that.

726
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,992
What I'm trying to say....

727
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:34,030
It's really hard for me to say
what I'm trying to say.

728
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,667
Loryn, this isn't helping me.
I don't know what to do about this.

729
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:40,570
Me, either.

730
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,062
- Oh, shit.
- Mom.

731
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,731
What's up?

732
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,770
I got this problem,
and I don't know what to do about it.

733
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,072
Yeah? That's easy.

734
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,487
Take it back and get a
more expensive one.

735
01:01:52,512 --> 01:01:54,968
The expensive ones always
fit better, honey.

736
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,045
Dad.

737
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:59,248
That's not it? All right, what is it?

738
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:03,352
You know, this is really hard.

739
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,821
All right.

740
01:02:06,621 --> 01:02:07,857
Shoot.

741
01:02:09,491 --> 01:02:12,794
I like Randy a lot, you know?

742
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:15,631
He's different.

743
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:19,034
What, he was in an accident?
Things don't work the way they should?

744
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,069
- No!
- I saw a movie like that, once.

745
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,371
Did you?

746
01:02:22,671 --> 01:02:25,073
- All right. How is he different?
- I don't know.

747
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,777
He doesn't dress like my friends,
or even talk like them.

748
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:30,813
I see.

749
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:33,515
Is that wrong?

750
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,620
My friends think so.

751
01:02:39,354 --> 01:02:40,789
That's important?

752
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:42,891
Sure, I guess.

753
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:46,762
- I don't want to lose them.
- Of course not.

754
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:49,832
And they all want me to be with Tommy.

755
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:55,837
- What do you want?
- I want to be with Randy.

756
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,309
It's getting hard. I
don't want any problems.

757
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:04,079
There's the rub, you see? Nothing's easy.

758
01:03:04,146 --> 01:03:06,048
I want to show you something.

759
01:03:07,949 --> 01:03:11,186
You see, honey,
sometimes the way things look...

760
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:14,189
aren't the way they really are...

761
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:16,859
or the way they're going to turn out.

762
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:18,126
Here.

763
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:21,997
I don't think you ever saw these.

764
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:27,302
- Are these you?
- Yep, that's me.

765
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,840
- Who's this?
- She's a friend of mine.

766
01:03:31,873 --> 01:03:33,876
Before I met your mother.

767
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:37,245
Not everyone looked or dressed like that
back then.

768
01:03:37,612 --> 01:03:40,316
In fact, lots of people
didn't look like that.

769
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:44,653
I can believe that.
I don't think Randy's ever looked this bad.

770
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:48,724
The point is,
what difference does it all make?

771
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:53,128
The way you look, the kinds of clothes
you wear on your body....

772
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:57,532
It's what you are that counts,
what's inside you, what you stand for...

773
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:00,836
not what other people want to make you.

774
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:03,639
Honey, there are lots
of people out there...

775
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:08,243
who ain't happy unless you live and think
the same way they do.

776
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,245
And if you don't....

777
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:15,951
- You dig what I'm saying?
- I know all about that stuff.

778
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,854
But which one do I pick?

779
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,323
Randy or Tommy.

780
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:25,327
Beats me, love,
but let me know when you decide.

781
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:27,529
- Okay?
- Okay.

782
01:04:56,658 --> 01:04:58,560
- Hi, Julie.
- Hi.

783
01:04:58,627 --> 01:04:59,828
- How are you?
- Good.

784
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:13,007
This has been too tough, you know?
It's not really fair.

785
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:15,243
It's either Randy, or you guys.

786
01:05:15,343 --> 01:05:17,212
Life's not fair.

787
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:22,617
Randy is totally special to me, Stacey...

788
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:25,854
and I don't understand why.

789
01:05:27,188 --> 01:05:30,125
I mean, he doesn't do
the things we like to do...

790
01:05:31,226 --> 01:05:35,263
- but...
- Julie, you left out one possibility:

791
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,466
totally gnarly sex.

792
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:40,068
It hasn't gotten that far.

793
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:45,774
I know everyone is counting on me
to do the right things.

794
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:47,209
So did you?

795
01:05:50,946 --> 01:05:52,414
I don't know.

796
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:56,018
But it was fun while it lasted.

797
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,453
So you've done the right thing.

798
01:05:58,553 --> 01:06:01,823
I don't know, you guys,
being popular can be so lonely.

799
01:06:02,524 --> 01:06:04,759
It doesn't have to be, Stacey.

800
01:06:04,826 --> 01:06:08,096
What am I going to do?
I kissed Tommy off in a major way.

801
01:06:08,196 --> 01:06:11,333
Forget that. I mean, Tommy is such a hunk.

802
01:06:11,933 --> 01:06:14,636
He told us he still loves you a bunch.

803
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:17,338
He did? When?

804
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:20,074
He just said it one day, you know?

805
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:23,345
Just make up with him. He'll take you back.

806
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:28,150
- He's got to be bummed to the max with me.
- He'll get over it.

807
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:32,354
Hey, you know, why break up
the most bitchin' couple at school?

808
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:35,690
I mean, Tommy can't be king of the prom
going stag.

809
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:38,025
He's got his position to worry about.

810
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:40,962
Okay, I'll talk to him.

811
01:06:41,229 --> 01:06:43,231
Are you sure he wants me back, though?

812
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:45,901
Of course. I just told you so.

813
01:06:46,234 --> 01:06:49,237
Hey, Julie, I asked Arthur to the prom.

814
01:06:49,304 --> 01:06:51,005
What'd he say?

815
01:06:51,706 --> 01:06:53,675
He goes, "Okay."

816
01:06:55,877 --> 01:06:57,445
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

817
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,148
I gotta go.

818
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:03,251
I've got all this homework
I forgot about. Come on, Loryn.

819
01:07:03,317 --> 01:07:04,785
- See you, Julie.
- Bye-bye.

820
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,788
- 'Bye, Julie.
- See ya.

821
01:07:16,497 --> 01:07:19,467
- How you been?
- I've been getting by, I guess.

822
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:21,035
You?

823
01:07:21,236 --> 01:07:22,470
All right.

824
01:07:22,537 --> 01:07:25,840
How's your new boyfriend?
What's-his-name?

825
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:29,811
It's over.

826
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:34,849
He wasn't mean to you, was he?

827
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:38,920
If he was, I'll go kick his ass sideways.
I did it once, I'll do it again.

828
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:43,057
It wasn't that. It was just that
he was different, that's all.

829
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:48,896
Is this what you want?

830
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:06,180
Listen, Doug's got his dad's Mercedes.

831
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:08,449
We're gonna cruise Van Nuys.
You wanna go?

832
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:10,885
- Sure, I guess.
- All right.

833
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:16,757
Can I have some of your hamburger?

834
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:18,960
You can.

835
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,093
- Hey, babe.
- Randy.

836
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:57,298
- What's the matter with you?
- Why didn't you call me first?

837
01:08:58,132 --> 01:09:00,935
It slipped my mind.
I didn't think it was that important.

838
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:05,506
But I will tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna reach in my pocket, get a dime...

839
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:09,377
go down to the phone booth, make a call,
come right back up, and talk to you.

840
01:09:09,477 --> 01:09:11,746
Why do you always barge in like that?

841
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:15,349
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- Don't tell me what to do.

842
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:19,019
You have no control over my life.

843
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,389
I can see anybody I want to, okay?

844
01:09:22,223 --> 01:09:23,558
I'm sorry.

845
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:27,361
I didn't think it was that big a deal.

846
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:30,965
Look, I have to go to bed now.

847
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:34,035
Hey, come over here.

848
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:36,704
I love you.

849
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:40,074
That's all I wanted to say.

850
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:43,578
I love you.

851
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,948
So, when can I see you.... Hey.

852
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:51,719
When can I see you again?

853
01:09:55,823 --> 01:09:58,159
- You can't.
- What?

854
01:09:58,226 --> 01:10:01,262
Don't do that to me!
You can't see me anymore.

855
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:04,598
Is it your father or mother?
Let me talk to them. I can fix things.

856
01:10:04,665 --> 01:10:06,834
There's nothing to fix. It's not them.

857
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:09,403
It's not them at all. It's me, okay?

858
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,972
I can't see you anymore, okay?

859
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:13,040
Okay.

860
01:10:16,677 --> 01:10:18,178
I know what it is.

861
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,950
I know what this is.
It's your fucking friends, right?

862
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:25,619
Shit, Julie, what is this?
It's between you and me...

863
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:29,190
not between the rest of the fucking world.
So fuck off!

864
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,126
It's your friends.

865
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:34,929
Fuck you!

866
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:40,234
Fuck off, for sure! Like, totally!

867
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:18,773
I don't fucking care. I don't give a fuck.

868
01:11:22,443 --> 01:11:24,378
I don't fucking care, man.

869
01:11:28,215 --> 01:11:31,085
- Randy? You look like shit.
- Hey, how you doing?

870
01:11:31,151 --> 01:11:33,721
- I shouldn't let you in here.
- You been doing good?

871
01:11:33,821 --> 01:11:36,290
- Come on.
- All right. That's what I want.

872
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:20,668
You feel so good.

873
01:12:22,102 --> 01:12:23,737
Hello, Samantha.

874
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,809
I've been looking for you tonight.

875
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:30,978
Liar. You haven't been looking for me...

876
01:12:31,044 --> 01:12:34,048
and I haven't been looking for you
in two months now.

877
01:12:35,082 --> 01:12:37,651
You're right. But here we are.

878
01:12:45,492 --> 01:12:48,128
Did I ever tell you how good you feel?

879
01:12:49,062 --> 01:12:50,864
You did tell me that.

880
01:13:01,575 --> 01:13:03,076
Let's make up.

881
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,848
You want to make up some more?

882
01:13:30,504 --> 01:13:32,272
Your place or mine?

883
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:34,167
How about a cigarette?

884
01:14:35,635 --> 01:14:37,237
How about a sip?

885
01:14:38,271 --> 01:14:40,007
What's he getting?

886
01:14:43,877 --> 01:14:45,879
- Who's that?
- Don't know.

887
01:15:41,001 --> 01:15:42,535
Go home, Randy.

888
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:57,250
Hey, puto, want a light?

889
01:15:58,485 --> 01:16:00,953
Fuck you, scum! Get out of the car.

890
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:03,423
- Are you bad at me?
- Yeah, I'm bad.

891
01:16:03,523 --> 01:16:06,860
- Get out of the fucking car, shit.
- Are you bad, man?

892
01:16:06,926 --> 01:16:09,662
- Get out of the car.
- I'll show you bad.

893
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,669
Come on, keep going!

894
01:16:25,512 --> 01:16:27,914
- Hey, man.
- What are you doing?

895
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:32,352
You're a dumb son of a bitch, man.
Guys like that'll kill you.

896
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,889
I don't give.... Fuck 'em.
Just leave me alone.

897
01:16:37,157 --> 01:16:40,260
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Fuck you, too.

898
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,797
Hey, man, who're you talking to?
It's me, Bailey.

899
01:16:45,098 --> 01:16:47,066
You're shitfaced.

900
01:16:47,533 --> 01:16:49,402
I don't feel so good.

901
01:16:50,804 --> 01:16:52,105
I'm going to be sick.

902
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:56,576
Go on. Leave me alone!

903
01:17:02,549 --> 01:17:04,617
Go on, now, leave me alone.

904
01:17:05,985 --> 01:17:09,222
Leave you alone? Why?
So you can feel sorry for yourself...

905
01:17:09,322 --> 01:17:13,025
because some little Valley chick
wanted somebody else, is that it?

906
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:29,242
Hit me with that brick. I'm dying.

907
01:17:29,508 --> 01:17:32,512
- Just put me out of my misery.
- Come on, man.

908
01:17:35,315 --> 01:17:37,116
Man, you smell fucking awful.

909
01:17:41,254 --> 01:17:42,722
Screw it, man.

910
01:17:43,423 --> 01:17:46,626
- You gonna make me feel great?
- Come off that, man.

911
01:17:47,927 --> 01:17:50,563
Look, if you want this girl so bad...

912
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:53,600
why don't you do something about it?

913
01:17:55,034 --> 01:17:56,402
I mean...

914
01:17:56,936 --> 01:17:59,872
go for the wild, crazy stuff.

915
01:18:04,277 --> 01:18:06,112
- Wild and crazy.
- Yeah.

916
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,548
Don't tell me that.

917
01:18:09,582 --> 01:18:14,053
Come on, man. It's romantic shit.
Girls love that stuff, you know?

918
01:18:16,222 --> 01:18:19,191
Trust me. It never fails.

919
01:18:21,094 --> 01:18:22,328
I know.

920
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:39,779
We have to talk.

921
01:18:40,246 --> 01:18:41,947
I told you we can't.

922
01:18:42,047 --> 01:18:44,083
- Young man....
- What?

923
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:46,219
Are you being held prisoner, or what?

924
01:18:46,252 --> 01:18:48,755
- Give me a signal.
- Get out of the car.

925
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:52,058
- But I love you.
- Get out of the car!

926
01:18:54,894 --> 01:18:56,128
Let's go.

927
01:19:02,902 --> 01:19:05,971
You've just heard Men at Work.
We have more dedications tonight...

928
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:08,541
to Billy from Dina. She
says, "You're a fox."

929
01:19:08,675 --> 01:19:11,377
Andrea to Doug, she'll do
"anything to get you back."

930
01:19:11,744 --> 01:19:15,415
To Julie, his favorite Valley girl,
Randy sends his undying love, and says;

931
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:17,917
"Like, come back soon, you know."

932
01:19:22,655 --> 01:19:25,213
I've got to get to Algebra.
I'll see you later.

933
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:26,249
Okay. See you.

934
01:19:51,283 --> 01:19:52,885
Enjoy your ride.

935
01:20:01,694 --> 01:20:04,497
- Oh, bitchin'. Is this in 3-D?
- No, but your face is.

936
01:20:04,563 --> 01:20:06,732
Like, I hate 3-D. It gives me a headache.

937
01:20:06,832 --> 01:20:08,367
It's not in 3-D.

938
01:20:09,335 --> 01:20:10,836
Have a nice flight.

939
01:20:13,973 --> 01:20:16,142
Good. Check this geek out.

940
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:18,077
Who is this guy?

941
01:20:19,478 --> 01:20:23,149
I guess these go
right back down there now, don't they?

942
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:26,652
How you doing down there?

943
01:20:27,553 --> 01:20:30,690
It appears you forgot
our French fries and Coke, fishhead.

944
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:35,094
Peter Piper picked a pepper,
I guess I did. I'm sorry.

945
01:20:35,194 --> 01:20:37,429
- That guy's nuts.
- What a geek!

946
01:21:01,086 --> 01:21:02,488
Oh, my God!

947
01:21:03,455 --> 01:21:07,025
Don't do that. Come on, Julie!

948
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:10,229
Don't do this.

949
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,503
- She's out there somewhere.
- Yep.

950
01:21:19,538 --> 01:21:21,607
What you're doing ain't working.

951
01:21:21,741 --> 01:21:23,342
You need a good plan.

952
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:25,511
I didn't know that.

953
01:21:26,612 --> 01:21:30,949
Listen, if you're going to have that
kind of attitude, I won't even tell you.

954
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:35,254
Just forget I ever tried to save you
from your miserable existence.

955
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:42,394
Okay, I'll tell you. Twist my arm.

956
01:21:43,696 --> 01:21:46,598
Listen, I got a plan...

957
01:21:47,165 --> 01:21:52,171
that's going to get you in solid with the
love of your life, and at the same time...

958
01:21:52,271 --> 01:21:57,008
achieve the grandest form of retribution
against the guy who kicked your ass.

959
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,578
So he had a little help.

960
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:06,118
Oh, man.

961
01:22:19,598 --> 01:22:22,200
Where are you and Arthur going?

962
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,503
We're going straight to the hot-tub club.

963
01:22:25,437 --> 01:22:29,274
Listen. We were on the waiting list,
and we got in.

964
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:31,977
- Oh, my God.
- Where's Julie going with Tommy?

965
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:35,080
I heard...

966
01:22:35,848 --> 01:22:38,650
Tommy made reservations
at the Valley Sheraton!

967
01:22:38,717 --> 01:22:41,387
Does she know?

968
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:44,123
- No.
- No way!

969
01:22:51,964 --> 01:22:56,501
Far out. This kid doesn't miss a trick.
Sarah, you got to see this.

970
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:00,839
Sarah! Lancelot's here!

971
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:02,607
Not so loud, dear.

972
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:07,579
Look at me. I'm probably more nervous
than the kids are. Look at these hands.

973
01:23:07,646 --> 01:23:10,048
I don't understand
what you're so nervous about.

974
01:23:10,082 --> 01:23:11,817
You act like it's your prom.

975
01:23:11,883 --> 01:23:14,186
I don't know. Feel these hands.
They're wet.

976
01:23:14,687 --> 01:23:16,788
- Wow.
- Look at her.

977
01:23:16,855 --> 01:23:18,623
Look at you, honey.

978
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:22,060
You look lovely, darling.

979
01:23:22,427 --> 01:23:23,695
Beautiful!

980
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:26,031
That's Tommy. Quick, get the camera.

981
01:23:26,098 --> 01:23:28,333
We can't miss a moment of this. Hurry.

982
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:29,868
What's the deal with him?

983
01:23:30,068 --> 01:23:32,771
I think your father
has just faced his mortality.

984
01:23:34,707 --> 01:23:38,510
You're both in pink, you
just look beautiful.

985
01:23:38,944 --> 01:23:41,813
Steve! Hurry up, dear! Tommy's here.

986
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:47,753
Are you all right, honey?

987
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:52,023
I'm coming. I'm looking for the camera.

988
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:57,295
Just wait two more minutes. Steve will be
here in just one minute with the camera.

989
01:23:57,395 --> 01:23:59,798
We have to get a picture of this.
We really do.

990
01:24:01,032 --> 01:24:02,534
Hurry up, dear!

991
01:24:07,306 --> 01:24:10,242
- Here he is.
- Hi, Tommy. How you doing, man?

992
01:24:10,275 --> 01:24:11,743
Mighty spiffy.

993
01:24:11,843 --> 01:24:13,978
Look at them. Are they a picture?

994
01:24:14,078 --> 01:24:18,417
We got to get a picture of this.
I still got film in here from the wedding.

995
01:24:18,483 --> 01:24:21,286
- What wedding?
- They were married last September.

996
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:23,955
- Newlyweds.
- Can't be too careful.

997
01:24:25,123 --> 01:24:27,726
Okay, let's get some snapperoos here.

998
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:29,862
Dad. Earth to Dad.

999
01:24:30,162 --> 01:24:32,831
Imagine that. The old lens cap.

1000
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:35,166
- Okay, here we go.
- Closer.

1001
01:24:35,234 --> 01:24:38,637
No stopping us now. Get closer together.
Give us a big smile, Tommy.

1002
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:41,239
- Smile, come on. Closer.
- That's it. Not too much.

1003
01:24:41,306 --> 01:24:43,768
A little goes a long
way with some people.

1004
01:24:43,793 --> 01:24:44,793
I got to go.

1005
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:50,482
You look beautiful. Have a wonderful time.

1006
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:52,750
- Trust me.
- Me, too.

1007
01:24:53,918 --> 01:24:55,053
'Bye!

1008
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:59,491
Come on. Let's go see 'em.

1009
01:25:05,764 --> 01:25:07,198
Her first prom.

1010
01:25:09,768 --> 01:25:11,002
Far out.

1011
01:25:13,838 --> 01:25:15,674
Feeling better, dear?

1012
01:25:17,175 --> 01:25:18,210
Yeah!

1013
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:21,213
You know...

1014
01:25:22,481 --> 01:25:24,616
maybe we should have gone.

1015
01:25:26,017 --> 01:25:28,486
I mean, how bad could it have been?

1016
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,054
What?

1017
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,328
Your prom.

1018
01:25:39,197 --> 01:25:42,533
What is this, Bangkok?
I don't need a massage.

1019
01:25:44,903 --> 01:25:47,405
Do you have any of that stuff for me?

1020
01:25:48,673 --> 01:25:51,409
Sure. Come on. We'll light it up.

1021
01:25:51,676 --> 01:25:54,813
- Are you ready to party?
- Yeah!

1022
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:58,917
Let's hear it.
Here's Josie Cotton and the Party Crashers!

1023
01:26:34,852 --> 01:26:37,561
You think this is
something, wait till later.

1024
01:26:37,586 --> 01:26:38,880
What do you mean?

1025
01:26:51,436 --> 01:26:53,938
- I can't believe this.
- Shit.

1026
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,676
We should've shined up the wagon,
or cleaned out the back seat.

1027
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:01,179
- I'm doing the best I can.
- What is this?

1028
01:27:01,245 --> 01:27:04,316
Did you clip butterflies' wings
as a kid? Maybe you still do.

1029
01:27:04,382 --> 01:27:07,985
Listen, I told you, I've got a plan.
Enough said?

1030
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:46,724
This is it, Fred.
I'm rushing that birthday cake.

1031
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:50,995
Cool everything and listen.
This is all going like clockwork.

1032
01:27:51,162 --> 01:27:55,099
I'm getting very excited about this.
So just hang on.

1033
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,235
This will be a night we'll never forget.

1034
01:27:58,303 --> 01:28:00,705
- Come on, what is it?
- You'll see.

1035
01:28:06,277 --> 01:28:09,747
- They really are rather dissolute.
- Where are the cups?

1036
01:28:09,847 --> 01:28:12,383
Miss Liebman, do you know
where the cups are?

1037
01:28:12,483 --> 01:28:15,086
- I don't know where the cups are.
- Looking for the cups?

1038
01:28:15,152 --> 01:28:18,089
- Mr. Brooks, do you know...
- I haven't seen cups all evening.

1039
01:28:18,123 --> 01:28:21,926
Suzi was supposed to bring them,
but she never even showed up.

1040
01:28:42,247 --> 01:28:43,615
Thank goodness.

1041
01:28:44,949 --> 01:28:47,251
I think we should get out of here.

1042
01:28:48,219 --> 01:28:52,890
Arthur, let's wait until after they
announce the king and queen at least, okay?

1043
01:28:53,724 --> 01:28:54,726
Okay.

1044
01:29:20,785 --> 01:29:22,386
Boys, how we doing?

1045
01:29:22,453 --> 01:29:23,921
- Mr. Brooks.
- Hi, Mr. Brooks.

1046
01:29:24,022 --> 01:29:26,257
- How's that punch?
- It's Bosco.

1047
01:29:26,924 --> 01:29:29,093
I'd like to try some. Where are the cups?

1048
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,928
Wow, there's no cups.

1049
01:29:36,767 --> 01:29:38,269
A little flat.

1050
01:29:58,089 --> 01:29:59,523
She's there.

1051
01:30:00,457 --> 01:30:04,661
Suzi, where have you been?
Everybody's been waiting for the cups.

1052
01:30:06,363 --> 01:30:09,166
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?

1053
01:30:09,633 --> 01:30:12,503
- Have you been getting laid, Suzi?
- Loryn, just....

1054
01:30:16,006 --> 01:30:17,541
Where's Ralphie?

1055
01:30:17,608 --> 01:30:21,378
Indian wrestling with the boys,
or something totally grody like that.

1056
01:30:21,445 --> 01:30:23,013
Wow. Sorry.

1057
01:30:23,547 --> 01:30:27,051
It's cool. I'm not going to eat
anything now...

1058
01:30:27,151 --> 01:30:30,488
so when we go to La Serre,
I can scarf up half the menu.

1059
01:30:30,554 --> 01:30:33,357
- All right.
- Okay, 'bye.

1060
01:30:39,063 --> 01:30:42,199
- Stacey. Check out this, dude.
- I don't want to see Stacey.

1061
01:30:45,603 --> 01:30:48,339
That's it, Bailey. I've had it with you.

1062
01:30:48,439 --> 01:30:52,276
- I didn't think her haircut was so bad.
- What do you mean, her haircut?

1063
01:30:52,343 --> 01:30:55,112
I just want to know
the rest of this big plan of yours.

1064
01:30:55,179 --> 01:30:58,816
What do you mean, "the rest"?
This is it. Simplicity at its finest.

1065
01:31:03,353 --> 01:31:05,322
Simplicity at its finest?

1066
01:31:06,357 --> 01:31:08,659
At least you got me here.

1067
01:31:09,126 --> 01:31:10,528
So let's...

1068
01:31:11,562 --> 01:31:13,964
crush that fly.

1069
01:32:01,945 --> 01:32:03,313
Is this on?

1070
01:32:06,484 --> 01:32:08,285
And now, students...

1071
01:32:08,752 --> 01:32:11,055
the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

1072
01:32:11,121 --> 01:32:14,558
the announcement of
the king and the queen of Valley High.

1073
01:32:14,592 --> 01:32:17,328
What is being king and queen all about?

1074
01:32:18,195 --> 01:32:21,031
Is it about who wears the nicest clothes?

1075
01:32:22,499 --> 01:32:23,900
I think not.

1076
01:32:25,302 --> 01:32:28,939
Is it about who's dating
the captain of the football team?

1077
01:32:29,539 --> 01:32:32,175
Or who's seeing the head cheerleader?

1078
01:32:32,876 --> 01:32:34,478
I don't think so.

1079
01:32:34,711 --> 01:32:36,847
Is it a popularity contest?

1080
01:32:38,081 --> 01:32:39,449
I doubt it.

1081
01:32:39,616 --> 01:32:42,886
I'm going to give you the chance
you never gave me.

1082
01:32:42,953 --> 01:32:46,490
When one is honorable,
when one is disciplined...

1083
01:32:46,556 --> 01:32:48,759
when one has school spirit.

1084
01:32:50,294 --> 01:32:51,495
Yes...

1085
01:32:52,463 --> 01:32:54,198
kings and queens...

1086
01:32:54,498 --> 01:32:55,966
they don't grow on trees.

1087
01:32:56,066 --> 01:32:57,167
Hold this.

1088
01:32:57,267 --> 01:32:59,803
Everyone can't be a king and a queen.

1089
01:33:00,637 --> 01:33:02,539
Let's go, boy. Get up.

1090
01:33:04,007 --> 01:33:05,775
I remember my prom.

1091
01:33:07,377 --> 01:33:09,379
I wanted to be the queen.

1092
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:11,848
I wasn't.

1093
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,384
Stop it!

1094
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:18,021
Watch this.

1095
01:33:18,622 --> 01:33:22,826
Who have set an example
for our whole school with their behavior.

1096
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:25,763
They need no introduction...

1097
01:33:25,863 --> 01:33:29,299
because they are not just
the king and queen of Valley High...

1098
01:33:29,366 --> 01:33:31,201
they are Valley High.

1099
01:33:31,902 --> 01:33:34,604
Your king. Your queen.

1100
01:34:06,903 --> 01:34:08,972
Get your hands off me, you fucking dick.

1101
01:34:15,378 --> 01:34:17,514
Julie, what's going on here?

1102
01:35:06,362 --> 01:35:08,865
That must be some party
you got going there.

1103
01:35:08,965 --> 01:35:10,033
Yeah.

1104
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:11,701
Valley Sheraton?

1105
01:35:12,269 --> 01:35:13,503
Sir?

1106
01:35:16,039 --> 01:35:17,107
Yeah.
