- Hello, Duke.
- [Man] Welcome, Condor.

41
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,884
- I heard you had some
trouble in the Amazon.
- It was okay.

42
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:27,838

to roll with it.

00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,680
We wouldn't want to lose
our best agent, now, would we?

44
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,729
Come and sit down.
We'll have a cup of tea.

45
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,494
I don’t think you brought
me here for a cup of tea.

46
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,707
- Did you?
- Uh, you're right, Jackie.

47
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,390
How much do you know
about the Second World War?

48
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:43,150
- Enough to know
we must never have a third.
- [Chuckles]

49
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,247
In the latter part
of the Second World War,

50
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:50,237
the German forces
were retreating out of Africa.

51
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,031
An officer was ordered
to bury gold...

52
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,003
in a secret base
in the African desert.

53
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:58,711
The gold was looted
from all over Europe.

54
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,136
The captain in charge
of the mission is now dead.

55
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:04,968
Only he and his men
knew of the base.

56
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,591
This officer in charge,
with 18 men, hid the gold,

57
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:11,063
but immediately after
the mission was completed,

58
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:14,291
the officer, along with
his 18 guards, disappeared.

59
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:18,985
- Where do I fit in?
- Well, the United Nations have
ordered me to find the gold.

60
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:21,326
And because
the bullion was taken...

61
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,415
from many different countries
during the war,

62
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,197
it's more than possible
they will begin a dispute...

63
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:27,924
over the right
of possession.

64
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,846
So I felt if you
found it first, well,

65
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,668
it would be a little
less embarrassing.

66
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,318
This way, we can avoid an incident.
That's why you're here.

67
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,402
Now, let me introduce you
to Colonel Bartok.

68
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:43,735
- Pleased to meet you.
- Lieutenant Colonel Bernard.

69
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:46,172
- Nice to meet you.
- It's quite an honor, Condor.

70
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:50,350
- And this is Ada.
- Hello.

71
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:53,132
Ada's an attaché
to the U.N.

72
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,676
She's an expert
on African desert environment.

73
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:58,636
Under her guidance, I'm confident
you will find your destination.

74
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,212
She's gonna be
my guide?

75
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:03,680
- Sounds as though you have
no confidence in me.
- Don't get me wrong.

76
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,178
I expect the worst
and always hope for the best.

77
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,924
lf you work out the details before hand
and stick to your plan...

78
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,632
naturally you have
to be flexible...

79
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,378
you don’t need
to stand around hoping.

80
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,806
It's a pleasure working with
someone with so much confidence.

81
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:18,858
I can see you'll both
get along just fine. [Chuckles]

82
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:22,256
Colonel Bartok, show the Condor
the key which he will need...

83
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:23,994
for the special mission.

84
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,825
Ah. Certainly.
A most unusual key.

85
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:28,614
It's the key to open
the door to the base.

86
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,763
Will the gold still be there
after 40 years?

87
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:33,701
Once the base was sealed,
the government kept the key.

88
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,123
[Ada] That's right.

89
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,948
- Now, I have another question.
- What?

90
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,773
For the period of this mission, Condor
and I are supposed to be partners,

91
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:44,922
but just in case of a misunderstanding,
who has the final word?

92
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,892
- [Duke] Who do you suggest?
- No problem I can see.

93
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,814
So I make
the decisions, then.

94
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:53,185
- I'll see you tomorrow morning,
Royal Library at 10:00.
- But tomorrow...

95
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:56,037
- Hey. I thought it was my decision.
- Tomorrow morning.

96
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:59,211
I have a few details to discuss
with the Colonel. Good-bye, Duke.

97
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,317
- Use the library.
- All right. See you in the morning.

98
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:05,673
Good day.

99
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,916
- I have all the research materials...
- [Chuckles]

100
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,990
Who said "Expect the worst
and hope for the best," huh?

101
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:13,758
- [Chuckling]
- She's quite a girl.

102
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,535
[Ada] What do you know
about the desert?

103
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:19,433
- [Jackie] It's all sand.
- Wrong. Only 25% of the Sahara
is covered by sand.

104
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:22,807
Temperatures can reach
up to 130 degrees by day,

105
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:24,625
and at night, they fall
below freezing.

106
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,613
It rains only once
every few years.

107
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:29,047
Man can survive
seven days without food...

108
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:31,495
but will die after only
two days without water.

109
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:37,315
- Are you listening, Jackie?
- Yeah. Who are these guys?

110
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:41,871
The circled one was the officer
in command of the mission

111
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,830
- and some of his men.
- According to this.

112
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:47,381
He could
still have family around here.

113
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:50,756
What are you doing?

114
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:53,226
- I want to look for them.
- That's useless.

115
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,427
The German government has searched
everywhere with no luck.

116
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:59,007
Geography lesson is over for the day.
I got to go.

117
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:01,837
W-Wait! Jackie!

118
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:03,547
There's still
work to do!

119
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,539

the water problem yet.

- Who are you?

- I'm asking you.
- Me? I'm here to help you.

139
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:33,713
- Yeah, but who are you?
- Let me ask him first. Who are you?

- [Gun Cocking]
- [Man] Freeze!
Don't move, or I'll shoot.

00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,659
- Who are you?
- Who we are is not your business.

142
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,256
We want the gold.

143
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:43,581
You follow her here
for gold? What gold?

144
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,017
Ask her.

145
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:50,198
Oh. So you've been the ones who’ve
followed me and annoyed me on the phone.

146
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,731
And you're the granddaughter
of that German who hid it.

147
00:14:52,732 --> 00:14:54,909
You tell me where the gold
is hidden, or I'll shoot.

148
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,031
- [Gasps]
- No, no. I said we were
not to use violence.

149
00:14:58,032 --> 00:15:01,337
Quiet! We must not
fight in front of people.

150
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:03,781
Tell us where the gold is,

151
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,112
or I'll shoot
your boyfriend dead.

152
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:09,176
[Sighs]
He's not my boyfriend.

153
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:11,054
That's right.
I'm not her boyfriend.

154
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,974
So, it's none
of my business, is it? Bye-bye!

155
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:15,394
Hold it!

156
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:18,140
Then why
are you here?

157
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:23,046
Uh... I saw a for sale sign,
and came up to take a look around.

158
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:27,926

so I got curious. Pretty nice view.

- Soldiers of the faith will
never give up the holy battle,

164

00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,750
Now, get out of here!

169
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,262
- You better not bother her again.
- We will never give up the gold.

170
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:17,796
Justice is on our side!

171
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,799
- Why did you pull my towel off
in front of those pigs?
- [Choking]

172
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,682
- Wasn’t there another way?
- [Gasps] It worked, didn’t it?

173
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:42,815
Hey, Mack. How you been?

174
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,297
Jackie, is that you?

175
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:47,791
- Yeah, it's me.
- [Metal Wind Chime Clattering]

176
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,185
- I need you to take a look at this key.
- Let me see it.

177
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,033
The key is in three parts.

178
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,165
Some of these knobs
are insulators,

179
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,607
which means that
when you turn the key,

180
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,856
you could set off
an electrical system.

181
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:05,827
The design of the handle
also has some purpose.

182
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:10,691
- It could be a trap, do you think?
- Yes. It could easily be that,

183
00:17:10,692 --> 00:17:13,961
unless you know the combination number
that was used to open the door.

184
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,279
So whoever locked it
is the only one who knows.

185
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,033
- I'm afraid that's right.
- Okay, Mack. Thanks.

186
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:22,944
Good luck.

187
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:28,657
Okay, what's the deal?

188
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,988
I got a piece too.

189
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:42,727
Hand it over, quick.

190
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:44,717
Empty your pockets.

191
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,898
- [Coins Jangling]
- Come on. The other one.

192
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,360
Where's the key?

193
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,590
- He's got the gun!
- Hold it!

194
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:11,186
- Hey, you there.
- [Yelling]

195
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:14,488
- Hold it.
- [Sirens Wailing In Distance]

196
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:23,220
[Tires Screeching]

197
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,434
There! Get him!

198
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:37,791
- [Man] Don't let him get away!
- [Man Grunts]

199
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,925
- [Woman Screams]
- Sorry.

200
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,030
Come on!

201
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,138
This way!
After him!

202
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:10,042
- Did you see that?
- That's my car!

203
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:11,764
- Look out!
- [Men Yelling]

204
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:19,488
- [Yells]
- [Mover] Hey! What are you doing?

205
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:20,489
No!

206
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,358
My painting!
[Groaning]

207
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,212
Hey! What are you
doing with my paint?

208
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,358
One more shot, please.

209
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,462
[Crowd Screaming]

210
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,866
[Woman Screaming] Grab my baby!
My baby!

211
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,826
Help me! My baby!

212
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,771
- [Truck Horn Blowing]
- No!

213
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:34,096
- Bumpy ride, huh?
- [Cars Approaching]

214
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,504
Oh! My baby.

215
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,406
- Hold on!
- What the hell are you doing in here?

216
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:54,284
- Hey, look out!
- [Men Yelling]

217
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:34,821
There!

218
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,783
Watch it, you idiot!
Get him!

219
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:16,796
[Sighs]

220
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:27,084
[Duke] There's 240 tons of gold
in the secret base.

221
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:28,912
[Jackie] lf l live long enough
to see it.

222
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,030
These guys really
want to get me.

223
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:33,209
Could they be old enemies
who are after you?

224
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,695
They don't want me.
They want the key to the base.

225
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:39,667
Well, you don’t think I invited you here
to enjoy an African safari, huh?

226
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:41,479
[Horn Honking]

227
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:44,966
Wait a second.

228
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:50,096
Hey. What are you
doing here?

229
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:53,523
- I've decided I'm going with you.
- Who's the lady?

230
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:56,615
- She's the German officer's
granddaughter.
- Ah. It's a pleasure.

231
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:59,652
- How do you do?
- It's not some happy vacation
we're going on.

232
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:02,925
And anyway, you're related to one of
the officers in charge of the mission.

233
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:05,935
- I really...
- Why does everyone
treat him like a criminal?

234
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:08,203
I want to prove his innocence
once and for all.

235
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,769
- Take me with you.
- I'll be responsible for her.

236
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,059
I thought we already agreed
that it’s me who has the final word.

237
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,585
Ada, perhaps she can
help you on this mission.

238
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:22,457
This time, I'll make the decision.
You will all go together.

239
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,990
Of course.

240
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,489
Thank you.
I'm most grateful.

241
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,814
- Thank you, sir.
- Surely.

242
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:30,914
Thank you, sir.

243
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,511
- Be careful. Best of luck.
- See ya.

244
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,631
[Chuckles]

245
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,735
- Good hunting.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

246
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,577
- [Background Chattering]
- [Men Yelling]

247
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:36,637
Oh, my friends!
I thank the gods that smile on you!

248
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:38,003
Thank them for us too.

249
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:44,067
- [Spits]
- Whoever you are, good evening.
How's the food?

250
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:46,435
- Not too bad.
- More precious than gold.

251
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:50,173
Gold? Sounds interesting. Tell me
more about it. Sit down. Please.

252
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:52,653
[Innkeeper] Oh, it's only a rumor.
I'll tell you someday.

253
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:57,211
- It seems as though everyone's
heard about the gold here.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:24:57,721 --> 00:25:01,977
- Where do you think the real map is?
- Why are you so curious?

255
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,811
The soldiers who were to bury the gold
could have hidden it here.

256
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,359
But they’ve been missing for so long,
they're probably all dead.

257
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,733
So? To disappear
doesn’t mean they're dead.

258
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:12,811
Well, then why didn't
any of them show up?

259
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,641
Maybe they decided
to keep the gold for themselves.

260
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:18,376
Are you saying they may have
conspired to dig up the gold?

261
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:21,748
Let's say, together.
Or even on their own.

262
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:26,040
And then, of course, they could
have asked their relatives
to help them secretly.

263
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,509
Are you suggesting my grandfather
got me to spy on the two of you?

264
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,095
Oh, no. You don’t suppose?

265
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,255
You don’t like me. It was quite obvious
from the moment you saw me.

266
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:36,063
lf that's the way
you feel, I'm truly sorry.

267
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:40,126
Hey, come on.
Cut it out, both of you.

268
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:42,119
You shouldn’t argue
in front of strangers.

269
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,207
Does the meal
not please you, eh?

270
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,822
My cooking is not so bad.
You must eat.

271
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:49,001
- It's my specialty.
- I'm not hungry. I'm going upstairs.

272
00:25:49,002 --> 00:25:51,606
- What...
- Please bring the check.
You can take these away.

273
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,675
- You eat nothing, eh?
- No. Not tonight.

274
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:57,001
lf you really don't want it, sir.
Table three.

275
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:59,362
Look here, we work
as a team, don’t we?

276
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:03,180
Hey, it was you who agreed to bring
her along. I was against it.

277
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:08,018
- Jackie?
- Hmm? What's up?

278
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,844
- Come and see.
- Have a good night.

279
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,539
- Is anything missing?
- I don't know yet.

280
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,107
- Look at this whole mess.
- Jackie!

281
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:25,948
- What is it?
- It's awful. All of my luggage.

282
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:27,594
It's... It's everywhere.

283
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,225
You see?
They've gone through everything.

284
00:26:35,848 --> 00:26:38,178
Good thing I hid the key
somewhere safe.

285
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,943
- Why isn't this hidden somewhere safe?
- [Gasps]

286
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:44,649
Oh, my back!
Use your head! Keep listening!

287
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,103
Listen!

288
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,808
[Yells]

289
00:26:53,774 --> 00:26:56,996
- Who do you think did it?
- You know, that's a good question.

290
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:59,456
You came upstairs first.
Didn’t you see anyone?

291
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:01,742
Do you mean to say
that you’re accusing me?

292
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:04,631
Of course not.
But if the shoe fits...

293
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:06,865
You saw my room.
It's been searched.

294
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:10,044
Hmm. You could easily
have done it yourself.

295
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,715
It's what you call
"covering your tracks."

296
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:15,039
- She's crazy.
- Elsa.

297
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,840
- One minute, Jackie.
- What is it?

298
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:19,722
Your room is
pretty small, isn’t it?

299
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:23,076
Sleep in here, if you like.
On the sofa, of course.

300
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:26,166
The room isn’t large,
but the bed is comfortable.

301
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,934
- Uh, wait!
- Don’t be afraid.

302
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:31,381
African vampires
don’t like Chinese blood.

303
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:33,802
Hmm.

Don't let her upset you.
I'll go try to straighten things out.

306
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:51,921
- Is the coast clear?
- How should I know?

307
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:56,089
- You're breaking my back!
- Quiet, you idiot!

308
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,761
It's fine.
l just don't get her.

309
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:10,417
Oh.

310
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,865
Harder work than
pumping water on a farm.

311
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:23,515
Hey, take it easy.
Just be nice.

312
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:27,200
- Lock your door.
I'll be back soon, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

313

[Door Creaks Open]

314
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,085
[Grunts]
Don’t play games with me.

315

[Grunts]

316
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:19,496
- Stop it!
- I'll kill you!

317
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:22,052
- It's me!
- You Peeping Tom!

318
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:27,075
- It's me, you idiot!
- You?

319
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:29,273
[Groans]
It's me!

320
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,845
I knew you wanted to hit me,
but did you have to hit so hard?

321
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,538
Oh, yes. I knew
it was you, all right.

322
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,584
That’s why I hit you so hard.
[Gasps]

323
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,522
- Are these friends of yours?
- Check their bags.

324
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:44,893
Oh, not again.
l just finished packing.

325
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,901
- Oh, ho, ho. Thank you.
- Uh, may I?

- Yes. Bye-bye.

Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

[Chuckles Nervously]
What's that?

331
00:30:04,294 --> 00:30:06,409
Chocolate.
Good sleep, eh?

332
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:09,671
Eh, no. No chocolate.
No good sleep.

333
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:14,461
- "No good sleep"?
- Go away. We are not sleeping.

Go away! I don't want you in my room.

- Jackie, what's...
- Uh, some business has come up.

349
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:12,789
It won't take long.
Go back to your room.

350
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,833
"Business"?
What kind of business?

351
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,660
[Sighs]
This business.

352
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:20,101
I don't usually wear
a towel to do business.

353
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,009
- What's going on?
- Hey!

354
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,895
Go away! I'm busy!

355
00:31:23,896 --> 00:31:27,028
Can’t you see us getting smelly
in here? [Sniffing]

356
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,230

Don't hurt him! Please!

- Just tell us what you’re looking for!
- Where is the map and the key?

364
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:57,267
I don't know where they are.

I can’t tell you.
I don’t know!

Stop hitting me!
Try hitting her, okay?

No.

371
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:27,183
Well, okay. Talk,
or I'll take it off.

372
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:30,362
[Gasps] Jackie, if he takes
my towel, I'll be naked!

373
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:33,436

I have roast chicken.
Roast chicken, you see?

You like very much?
You see? Roast chicken?

00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:53,610
- Drop the gun, or he’s dead.
- [Elsa] Great! I knew you’d do it!

389
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:56,257
I knew you’d see the gun!
Good idea, huh?

390
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:58,595
Yeah! That's for
pulling off my towel.

391
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:02,597
- You're going to get a big kiss.

Jackie?
What are you doing?

394
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:13,698
- Why is there so much tape on the gun?
- I was afraid it would fall out.

395
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,199
Oh, I'm sorry.

396
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:21,226
- I told you not to come in.
- We don’t want to hurt anyone.

397

We mean what we say. We want
what we came for... the key and the map.

398

Oh, but I am telling you
I don’t have it!

399

You searched my luggage.
I'm not the type to lie.

400
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:33,263
I know nothing. I am sorry if you don't
believe me, but what can I do?

- Oh! [Shrieks]
- Hmm? Hmm.

00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:43,370
Why were you just
standing there staring?

404
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,355
- Why did you pull my towel off?
- She meant well. Don’t start.

405
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:48,633
- Why'd you hit me?
- Serves you right for looking!

406
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:49,949
- They looked. Why don’t you hit them?
- What?

407
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,861
Cut it out. We're wasting time.
Start with her.

Me?

409
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:00,906

- Are you really going to talk?
- You told me to.

414
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:17,241
But it won't help them.
You're completely surrounded
by my men out there.

415
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:19,039
[Ada] Are they really out there?

416

the key? Did you?

Well, we are born and we die,
and we don't know why.

philosophy is this?

- Momoko, look out!

00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:56,296
- It's poisonous!
- It's my pet. The little darling.

00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:58,114
Oh, where! [Crying]

496
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:04,570
- [Both Laughing]
- It's all right.
It's my pet, Ding Ding.

497
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:08,714
He's a darling. He doesn’t sting
unless someone provokes him.

498
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:10,752
I'm sorry
he scared you.

00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:19,500
It's a lovely moon tonight.
It looks beautiful, doesn’t it?

501
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:21,034
I must get some rest.

Stop! You dare to strike a chief?
Bring me my gun.

00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:19,399
[Ada] Jackie!

507
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:22,848
Stop with the noise,
or I'll beat you to death!

508
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:28,577

Okay, now.

- I'm okay, but John is badly wounded.

519
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:19,946
- Who are those people?
- They are desert bandits.

Where did all those people
come from?

525
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,118
From the desert.
It's a market.

526
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,736
- They're holding an auction.
- Let's wait until dark.

- Uh-huh.

Going for 20, once.

The blonde has a big behind.

sink your teeth into.

lf this map is correct,
we should be near the place.

00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:39,622
Nothing but sand.
It could take years to shovel that up.

- Read it for yourself, you idiot!

- You got your compass?
- Yeah, sure.

Ahh! Turn the compass,
not my arm.

You see.
We're near the spot.

611
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,479
There are so many
sand dunes out here.

612
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,526
After 40 years, the base could be
completely buried.

613
00:50:04,527 --> 00:50:08,796
- Are you sure it's supposed to be here?
- It should be right here.

614
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,542
The map could have
been wrong.

615
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:14,096
Military maps are always accurate
within approximately three miles.

616
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:17,348
"Three mile"? No problem. Let's call
a cab. Be there in half hour.

Who's this?

00:51:21,618 --> 00:51:26,162
- My grandfather.
- Oh. I stayed there
with one of my friends.

632
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:30,049
- The natives who live there
worship this idol.
- [Gasps]

633
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:34,080
See? I bought this figurine
because it resembled the idol.

- Could you take us there?

- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe we'll be lucky after all.

637
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:56,392
That's the place
in my photograph.

638
00:51:56,393 --> 00:51:59,708
Don't go down there. The natives
that live there are very vicious.

639
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:03,603
- We know all about vicious people.
- Thank you, Momoko.

640
00:52:03,604 --> 00:52:06,081
- Take care.
- Thank you for bringing
us here. Bye-bye.

641
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,804
- Good luck, Momoko. Bye-bye.
- Be careful! Bye!

642
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:24,866
- Hey. Are you praying?
- Checking if it's hollow below us.

644
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:35,873
Jackie! The entrance
is over here!

- Jackie, wait for us.
- Follow me.

[Moans] Ahead!

647
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:49,677

not a human one. Come on.

650
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,829

- Hurry!
- This way!

00:53:04,365 --> 00:53:06,165
This way. This way!

654
00:53:07,286 --> 00:53:10,329
- What are we gonna do?
- Out of my way!

655
00:53:13,038 --> 00:53:13,821
Your hands!

656
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,380
Get off! One at a time!

657
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:21,862
- He's coming!
- [Elsa] Take that!

No, don't! Jackie,
how could you do that?

00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:36,790
- What kind of book is it?
- It's my grandfather's diary.

711
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:40,788
What does it say in it?
Does he mention his killer?

712

"We pushed ahead 12 miles.

to give them to my men.

- That was my mother.

all of this fits together.

lf I’m not mistaken, your grandfather's
guards are down here.

When they completed the mission,
he made them take the poison pills.

728
00:58:38,568 --> 00:58:42,021
No wonder he was so unhappy.
He was ordered to kill his men.

729
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:44,242

He had 18 men.

00:58:44,243 --> 00:58:47,238

not to obey your grandfather.

- Who is this man?

you are Adolf.

You forgot it’s on this.
The last man didn't swallow the pill.

738
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:11,154
So he killed.

739
00:59:14,503 --> 00:59:18,030
- You killed my grandfather!
- Your grandfather was not a good man.

740
00:59:18,031 --> 00:59:19,982
In fact, he had
his own men poisoned,

741
00:59:19,983 --> 00:59:23,764

he broke both my legs!

826
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:34,470
All right.

827
01:08:34,471 --> 01:08:36,772
Where is it?
Where's the key?

828
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,300
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

829
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,335
Wait!
Before you shoot.

830
01:08:45,336 --> 01:08:47,754
I'm the only one who knows
how to use the key.

831
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:51,250
It was my grandfather who used
my mother’s birth date for a code,

832
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:53,212
and I'm the only one
who knows it.

833
01:08:54,688 --> 01:08:57,105
And I alone know
the procedure to unlock it.

834
01:08:57,906 --> 01:08:59,138
Is it that complicated?

835
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:01,256
Yes, it could be,
but it’s the only way to go.

836
01:09:01,257 --> 01:09:03,951
- Where is it?
- There should be a corridor over there.

837
01:09:03,952 --> 01:09:06,374
Let's get moving.
You, boy.

838
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,741
- You go first.
- Wait.

839
01:09:17,235 --> 01:09:19,786
You open it.
What's the combo?

840
01:09:19,787 --> 01:09:22,339
There are three steps.
First you need the number.

841
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,606
- My mother’s birth date
is on the 16th of September.
- Nine, one, six.

842
01:09:25,607 --> 01:09:26,607
Right.

843
01:09:27,554 --> 01:09:31,154
I have waited over 40 years
for this day to come. Now it’s here.

844
01:09:32,445 --> 01:09:33,265
[Gasps]

845
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:35,638
[Screaming]

846
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:50,973
You lying scum!
You're trying to kill us!

847
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:54,314
- I swear I wasn’t lying.
- I told you all I know
about the procedure.

848
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,732
And my mother’s birthday
is the 16th.

849
01:09:56,733 --> 01:10:00,050
- Are you sure there isn't
something you forgot?
- Let them go. Go on.

850
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:02,108
- [Gasping]
- No.

851
01:10:04,818 --> 01:10:07,651
- Let's go.
- Are you sure you got
her birthday right?

852
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:09,870
Of course.
It's on September 16.

853
01:10:09,871 --> 01:10:11,428
What is it on
the Chinese calendar?

854
01:10:11,429 --> 01:10:15,059
- They don’t use the Chinese calendar.
- See? It’s written here.

855
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,139
"I will use
Eliza's birthday, probably."

856
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,577
Then he wasn’t sure he'd use it.
Could he have used yours instead?

857
01:10:20,578 --> 01:10:22,984
- I wasn’t born yet.
- Oh, but of course not.

858
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,514
- What is it?
- It's my grandfather's tag.

859
01:10:28,442 --> 01:10:30,078
- Could it be?
- There are two.

860
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:31,485
But which side is it?

861
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:37,607
- Six, nine, eight?
- [Together] Could that be it?

862
01:10:41,865 --> 01:10:43,018
[Whimpering]

863
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:45,469
Those bullets can go
through ten people.

864
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:50,218
The first number
is six. Go.

865
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:52,375
[Tumblers Clattering]

866
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:57,292
- [Tumblers Clicking]
- Nine. Nine.

867
01:10:57,293 --> 01:10:59,144
Quit poking me.
Move your hand.

868
01:11:00,057 --> 01:11:03,918
[Tumblers Clattering, Clicking]

869
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:06,164
Eight.

870
01:11:06,165 --> 01:11:09,634
- Please? Number eight?
- [Tumblers Clicking]

871
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,901
- [Loud Creaking]
- It hasn't opened. Why not?

- [Gasps]
- [Clicking, Creaking]

873
01:11:16,626 --> 01:11:18,738

- [Women Whining]
- [Clicking]

875
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:26,426

01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:33,910

880
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,176
Get the other one.

[Grunting]

882
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:14,556
Gosh. How come
it's so small?

883
01:12:15,257 --> 01:12:19,087
- Well, where's the gold?
- This is only the elevator, imbecile.

884
01:12:19,553 --> 01:12:21,429
Come on. Let's go.
Hurry up.

885
01:12:32,534 --> 01:12:33,659
Over here.

886
01:12:43,132 --> 01:12:44,424
[Man] Look at that.

887
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:50,653
Remove the canvas.
Up there. Go on!

888
01:12:50,654 --> 01:12:53,145
Don’t stand there.
At the top of the stairs.

889
01:12:53,146 --> 01:12:55,209
- Leon, go quickly!
- Sure.

890
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,784
- Oh, man.
- Look at that.

891
01:13:06,605 --> 01:13:08,688
Oh, my God.

892
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:11,670
- That's incredible.
- Look at all that gold.

893
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:14,876
- We're rich! We're rich, boys!
- [Shouting, Cheering]

[Shouting, Laughing]

895
01:13:18,387 --> 01:13:20,972
Push me in!
Push me inside!

896
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:22,744
They won't listen
to you anymore.

897
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:27,328
- [Leon] Beautiful!
- [Adolf] Push me inside.
Do you hear? I order you!

898
01:13:27,329 --> 01:13:28,890
- Yes!
- All right!

899
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:30,991
Wow! Rich at last!

900
01:13:32,085 --> 01:13:33,131
Hey!

901
01:13:34,073 --> 01:13:36,118
- [Women Gasp]
- Don’t move!

902
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:38,663
Tell them to drop their guns,
or you’re dead.

903
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,184
You must do as he says,
and quickly. Do you hear?

904
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:43,981
- Put down your guns. - No.
- Put them down!

905
01:13:44,081 --> 01:13:46,776
Imbecile, you had better
listen to him!

906
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:49,023
Don’t you call me
an imbecile!

907
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,201
Then you had better
find a way to rescue me!

908
01:13:51,202 --> 01:13:53,908
Now I'm the boss.
Don’t talk like that to me.

909
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:56,061
You're what?
This is rebellion!

910
01:13:56,062 --> 01:13:59,476
With 240 tons of gold,
we can afford to rebel against you.

911
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,847
Okay, if you want it,
go ahead and kill him.

912
01:14:01,848 --> 01:14:04,435
- [Gasps]
- You calling my bluff?

913
01:14:04,436 --> 01:14:08,146
I'll count to three.
Drop your guns, or he’s dead. One.

914
01:14:08,147 --> 01:14:10,014
- [Ada Whimpering]
- Two.

915
01:14:11,712 --> 01:14:13,783
- Three
- Ahhh!

916
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:17,007
Well, he wins.

917
01:14:17,598 --> 01:14:19,182
lf you won't kill him,
then I will.

918
01:14:19,183 --> 01:14:21,900
There's more gold to come,
and only I know where it is.

919
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:26,476
I would be willing to share it
with you all equally if you
will just not kill me.

920
01:14:27,585 --> 01:14:29,482
I don’t think
you've many tricks left.

921

You come with me.

- I got this one over here.
- All right. Okay.

- That's it.
- Whoo!

- Let's get him!
- Now what, huh?

935
01:15:06,596 --> 01:15:09,918
There's a control room upstairs.
Go up and see how Jackie’s
doing. You, push me up.

[Elsa] Ada, down there!
Look!

937
01:15:30,589 --> 01:15:33,458
Where's the light?
It's impossible to see. Over there.

938

- Nothing works.
- [Grunting]

939
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,679
- Damn it! Which is the light switch?
- There are switches everywhere.

- Let's see. Um...

- We've got to help!
- [Ada] Why is Adolf
taking so long to get here?

947
01:17:29,347 --> 01:17:30,456
It's a suction!

948
01:17:31,548 --> 01:17:32,605
Damn strong!

949
01:17:33,425 --> 01:17:35,705
Oh!
It started again!

950
01:17:35,706 --> 01:17:36,706
Turn it off yourself.

951
01:17:56,536 --> 01:17:59,930
Oh, what now?
We could try the panel there!

952
01:18:00,596 --> 01:18:01,886
Break it!
Quickly!

- Don't touch that button!
- I already pressed it!

- It stopped!
- They've all stopped!
- You stop them.

957
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:27,626
Don’t you understand?
It's a military base.

958
01:18:27,627 --> 01:18:30,596
It's a self-destruct button.
The whole place will blowups.

959

In 30 minutes, we'll all be killed.

We have no time!

963
01:18:54,017 --> 01:18:55,502
Get the door!

01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:01,716
- I won't let him escape me.
- Open the door, you idiot!

Now see Superman's footwork!

- Warn him! Where's the mike?
- Ohhh!

01:20:58,504 --> 01:21:01,656
Quickly! The whole place
is going to explode, Jackie!

971
01:21:02,842 --> 01:21:04,115
Explode?

972
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:08,085
What?
We only have 20 minutes?

973
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:10,807
We were trying to help you get out,
and then Elsa pressed that button.

974
01:21:10,808 --> 01:21:12,705
There is no way out of here.

975
01:21:15,049 --> 01:21:18,244
There could still be a chance
if we can blast through the air vent.

976
01:21:18,245 --> 01:21:20,389
- The air vent? Are you sure?
- That's right.

977
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:23,564
The weakest section of this facility
is the ventilation shaft.

978
01:21:24,769 --> 01:21:26,382
Yeah. Wind power!

979
01:21:28,879 --> 01:21:32,271
- Oh, help me, Momoko.
- Okay.

980
01:21:34,573 --> 01:21:37,524
Jackie, here's the switch you wanted.
Adolf refuses to come with us.

981
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:41,170
I am not coming with you.
I should have died 40 years ago.

982

I want to be with my friends.
This is where I belong, you know. Bye.

He's staying, but if we want out,
we better start.

01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:50,357
Okay. You three
get ready.

01:21:54,163 --> 01:21:55,909
Starting... now.

986
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:59,922
You're running out of time.
I will turn the fans to maximum
power gradually. Good luck.

987
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:06,610
Here, Jackie.
You've got to push the switch.

[Whimpering]

989
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:10,329
- You're not bringing all that!
- It's my share!

- [Grunting] No!
- Too bad for you!

991
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:29,596
- Ahhh!
- What a waste!

992
01:22:36,946 --> 01:22:38,873
[Warning Siren Blaring]

993
01:23:12,463 --> 01:23:13,514
Now!

994
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:37,912
[Groaning]

995
01:23:49,746 --> 01:23:51,606
[All Screaming]

996
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:12,279
[Screaming]

997
01:24:18,993 --> 01:24:20,744
You're safe now.
Let's go.

998
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:27,140
Run! It's gonna cave in!

999
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,431
- Oh, the gold!
- So what?

1000
01:24:47,432 --> 01:24:49,071
At least
we're still alive.

1001
01:24:49,072 --> 01:24:51,168
Come on. Go.

1002
01:24:58,264 --> 01:24:59,737
[All Yelling]

1003
01:25:07,344 --> 01:25:08,795
A consolation prize?

1004
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:12,995
[Gunshot]

1005
01:25:12,996 --> 01:25:16,597
Oh, the fates be thanked!
They've led you back to us.

1006
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:24,502
Here. Here's the gold you wanted.
Might bring you luck.

1007
01:25:28,799 --> 01:25:31,024
Who wants gold?
We want water!

1008
01:25:34,314 --> 01:25:36,147
Here. You can
finish it.

1009
01:25:36,148 --> 01:25:37,854
[Shouting, Grunting]

1010
01:25:39,474 --> 01:25:42,174
It goes to show
we never really know what we need...

1011
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:43,329
or want.

1012
01:25:44,241 --> 01:25:46,555
I never thought
I'd see people fighting over water.

1013
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:51,439
Uh! Water! Water!

1014
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,765
I suggest we get together
and look for it.

1015
01:25:54,937 --> 01:25:57,698
- Well, you are the expert here.
- I don’t know.

1016
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:01,015
I think we should go that way.
There should be an oasis to the north.

1017
01:26:01,016 --> 01:26:03,174
- You sure?
- No.

1018
01:26:03,175 --> 01:26:05,900
- I think we should go over this way.
- It's that way.

1019
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:08,941
No. We've got to listen
to our desert expert.

1020
01:26:08,942 --> 01:26:12,163
We've walked over a million sand dunes.
Where's the water?

1021
01:26:12,164 --> 01:26:15,308
I am sure it is
just over the next one.

1022
01:26:15,309 --> 01:26:16,602
Are you sure?

1023
01:26:17,731 --> 01:26:20,267
- [Jackie Muttering]
- [Ada] As I was saying,

1024
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:23,647
only a quarter of the desert
is covered in sand.

1025
01:26:23,648 --> 01:26:26,194
[Amon] The gods must be
angry with us!
