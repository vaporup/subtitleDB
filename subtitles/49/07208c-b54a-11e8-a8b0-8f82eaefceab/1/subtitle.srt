1
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,075
Holy mackerel!

2
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,645
Call headquarters.
Get the lieutenant.

3
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:15,503
Holy Christmas!
That thing's doing about 4,000!

4
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,223
But that's incredible, sir.

5
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:20,145
That can't be aircraft.
Must be a buzz bomb.

6
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:24,007
This is Luckton
at Ferris to Charlie Baker.

7
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:29,236
I have a bogey at 2-0-0 thousand feet.
4-0-0-0 miles an hour.

8
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,647
(speaks Hindustani)

9
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,478
(man speaking French on radio)

10
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:48,723
Reports are coming in from all
over the Empire, all over the world.

11
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,329
The government has not yet issued
a statement, but there is no question

12
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:54,082
that there actually is a large,

13
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,200
unidentified object circling
the Earth at incredible speed.

14
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:59,464
This is Elmer Davis again.

15
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,370
We still don't know what it is
or where it comes from,

16
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:03,760
but there's something there.

17
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:06,426
It's been tracked around
the Earth by radar,

18
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,900
travelling at a rate
of 4,000 miles an hour.

19
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,122
This is not another
"flying saucer" scare.

20
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:15,849
Scientists and military men
are already agreed on that.

21
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,915
Whatever it is,
it's something real.

22
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:22,901
We interrupt this programme to give
you a bulletin from a naval unit at sea.

23
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,455
A large object travelling
at supersonic speed

24
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,310
is headed towards the
East Coast of the United States.

25
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,995
This is HV Kaltenborn speaking.

26
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,856
Here in the nation's capital
there is anxiety and concern,

27
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:36,634
but no outward sign of panic.

28
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,449
As a matter of fact,
there are signs of normalcy...

29
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,235
the beautiful spring weather,

30
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:43,369
the tourist crowds

31
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,186
around the public monuments
and other buildings.

32
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,978
(distant humming)

33
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,371
(humming crescendos)

34
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,506
(screaming)

35
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,411
They're here!

36
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,290
They're here!

37
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,052
They've landed! Over on the Mall!
They've landed!

38
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:23,006
(sirens)

39
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:05,317
- Get me the Chief of Staff.
- Thank you. Hold the line, please.

40
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:10,495
Hello. I want to speak to the President.

41
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:13,027
I'm sorry,
but you'll have to interrupt him.

42
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,789
Good afternoon. This is Drew Pearson.

43
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:18,321
We bring you this special
radio/television broadcast

44
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:19,582
in order to give you

45
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,732
the very latest information
on an amazing phenomenon...

46
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:25,648
the arrival of a spaceship
in Washington.

47
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:28,078
Government and Defense
Department officials

48
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,790
are concerned by reports of panic

49
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,514
in several large eastern cities.

50
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,542
I am authorised to assure you

51
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:38,038
that, so far, there is no
reasonable cause for alarm.

52
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:40,108
The rumours of invading armies

53
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,909
and mass destruction
are based on hysteria,

54
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,827
and are absolutely false.

55
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,546
I repeat,
these rumours are absolutely false.

56
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:53,650
The ship, designed for travel
outside the Earth's atmosphere,

57
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:58,829
landed in Washington today
at 3:47pm Eastern Standard Time.

58
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:01,092
We still do not know
where it came from.

59
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:04,851
The ship is now resting exactly
where it landed two hours ago,

60
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:08,227
and so far there is
no sign of life from inside it.

61
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:11,948
Troops have been rushed across
the Potomac River from Fort Myer

62
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,288
and have thrown a
cordon around the ship.

63
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:17,702
They are supported by tanks,
artillery and machine guns.

64
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,499
Behind the police lines there's
a huge crowd of curiosity seekers.

65
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,778
The army has taken every precaution

66
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,294
to meet any emergency
which may develop.

67
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:30,437
Every eye, every weapon
is trained on the ship.

68
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:32,680
It's been that way for two hours,

69
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:35,002
and the tension is
just beginning...

70
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,007
Just a minute,
ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:38,570
I think something is happening.

72
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:43,014
We have come to visit you in peace,
and with goodwill.

73
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:32,690
(screaming)

74
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,715
(screaming)

75
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,920
Gort! Deglet ovrosco!

76
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,402
It was a gift for your President.

77
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:54,084
With this, he could have
studied life on the other planets.

78
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,775
Get that ambulance over here.

79
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:04,365
Take him to Walter Reed Hospital
right away.

80
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,781
Mr Harley, sir, from the White House.

81
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:09,275
- General.
- Right in there, Mr Harley.

82
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:26,882
My name is Harley,
Secretary to the President.

83
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,830
I've been told you speak our language,
and that your name is Mr... Klaatu?

84
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:33,595
Just Klaatu.

85
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:37,086
The President conveys his
deepest apologies for what happened.

86
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:38,965
Sit down, Mr Harley.

87
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,037
Thank you.

88
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:49,284
I'm sure I need hardly point out that
your arrival was something of a surprise.

89
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,164
Had you been travelling long?

90
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,079
About five months.
Your months.

91
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,227
You must have come a long way.

92
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:58,912
About 250 million of your miles.

93
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,359
Naturally, we are very curious
to know where you come from.

94
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:06,431
From another planet.

95
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:08,579
Let's just say that we're neighbours.

96
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:11,264
It's hard for us to think
of a planet as a neighbour.

97
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:14,793
I'm afraid in the present situation
you'll have to learn to think that way.

98
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,514
- The present situation?
- I mean the reason for my coming here.

99
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:21,391
We're very curious about that, too.

100
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,690
- Would you care to talk about it?
- I'd be glad to.

101
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,219
Not now, of course, with you alone.

102
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,866
You'd rather talk personally
with the President?

103
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,952
This is not a personal
matter, Mr Harley.

104
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:36,889
It concerns all the
people on your planet.

105
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:39,574
I'm not sure I understand.

106
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:45,788
I want to meet with representatives
from all the nations of the Earth.

107
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:48,396
I'm afraid that would
be a little awkward.

108
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:50,698
It's completely without precedent.

109
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,498
And there are practical
considerations...

110
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,184
the time involved,
the enormous distances.

111
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,255
I travelled 250 million miles.

112
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:00,902
I appreciate that, but...

113
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:05,850
I want to be frank with you, Mr...
I mean Klaatu.

114
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:12,947
Our world at the moment
is full of tensions and suspicions.

115
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:17,550
In the present international situation,
such a meeting would be quite impossible.

116
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,698
What about your United Nations?

117
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:21,846
You know about the United Nations?

118
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:25,375
We've been monitoring your radio
broadcasts for a good many years.

119
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,580
That's how we
learned your languages.

120
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:30,055
I'm sure you recognise
from our broadcasts

121
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,814
the evil forces that have produced
the trouble in our world. Surely...

122
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,535
I'm not concerned, Mr Harley,
with the internal affairs of your planet.

123
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,758
My mission here is not
to solve your petty squabbles.

124
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:44,172
It concerns the existence
of every last creature on Earth.

125
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,857
Perhaps if you could explain a little...

126
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:51,153
I intend to explain.
To all the nations, at the same time.

127
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,452
How do we proceed, Mr Harley?

128
00:14:56,677 --> 00:15:00,820
Well, we could call a special meeting
of the General Assembly.

129
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:03,697
But of course, the United Nations
doesn't represent all the nations.

130
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:06,919
Then I suggest a meeting
of all the Chiefs of State.

131
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:08,809
Believe me, you don't understand.

132
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,062
They wouldn't sit
down at the same table.

133
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:15,051
I don't want to resort
to threats, Mr Harley.

134
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,542
I merely tell you that the
future of your planet is at stake.

135
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:22,033
I urge that you transmit that
message to the nations of the Earth.

136
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:32,006
I will make that recommendation
to the President.

137
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:35,692
But I must tell you in all honesty,

138
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:37,799
I'm extremely dubious
about the results.

139
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:42,287
Apparently I'm not as cynical
about Earth's people as you are.

140
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:46,506
I have been dealing in Earth's politics
a good deal longer than you have.

141
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,770
Good night, sir.

142
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:02,349
It is now 2am, and the giant robot
still hasn't moved.

143
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:05,725
Engineers from nearby Fort Belvoir
have failed to budge him,

144
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,867
and metallurgical experts
have found his huge body impregnable.

145
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:13,780
They're now concentrating on
the ship itself, so far with no results.

146
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,004
Getting anyplace, Sergeant?

147
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,919
Oh, no, sir.
This beats me, sir.

148
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:37,636
I saw the ramp come through
the side of the ship, right here.

149
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:39,366
Now I can't even find a crack.

150
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:44,315
Oh, Carlson.
What's the report?

151
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:48,956
No luck, sir. We've tried everything
from a blowtorch to a diamond drill.

152
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,789
- What about him?
- He's made out of the same stuff.

153
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:56,206
- Has he moved, Sergeant?
- No, sir. Not an inch.

154
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:59,505
This is the toughest material
I ever saw, General.

155
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:02,267
For hardness and strength,
it's out of this world.

156
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:05,528
I can tell you officially
that's where it came from!

157
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:10,246
The skeletal structure's
completely normal.

158
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,838
The tests show the
same for major organs...

159
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,696
the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.

160
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:17,419
Yeah, and the lungs
are the same as ours.

161
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:21,639
That must mean a similar
atmosphere, similar pressure.

162
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:25,743
- How old do you think he is?
- Oh, I'd say 35, 38.

163
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,965
He told me this morning
while I was examining him. He's 78.

164
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,456
- Well, I don't believe it.
- Life expectancy is 130.

165
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:33,958
How does he explain that?

166
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,522
Says their medicine's
much more advanced.

167
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:38,235
He was very nice about it,

168
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:41,432
but he made me feel like
a third-class witch doctor.

169
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,951
I removed a bullet from
that man's arm yesterday.

170
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:50,173
Well, what about it?

171
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:52,864
I just examined the wound,
and it's completely healed.

172
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,430
What does he say about it?

173
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,237
Said he put salve on it,
stuff he had on him.

174
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:58,977
What are you gonna do with it?

175
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,418
Take it downstairs
and have it analysed.

176
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,511
Then I don't know
whether to just get drunk

177
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:06,328
or give up the
practice of medicine.

178
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:12,427
- Afternoon, Mr Harley.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

179
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,362
Good afternoon.
I'm glad to see you up and around.

180
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:27,080
- Thank you. Have you any news?
- Not very good news, I'm afraid.

181
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:30,724
The President accepted
your suggestion,

182
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:33,333
and cabled the
invitations for a meeting.

183
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:38,435
Let me read you
some of the replies.

184
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:44,688
"The Premier wishes to inform the
government of the United States

185
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:48,562
that it will be impossible for him to attend
the meeting suggested by the President,

186
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,247
unless the meeting is held in Moscow."

187
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:56,234
"The suggestion of the President
of the possibility of a meeting in Moscow

188
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,840
would be unacceptable to His Majesty's
Government at the present time."

189
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:04,711
"Representation could be sent only
if the meeting were held in Washington."

190
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:07,166
Well, there you have it.

191
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,536
Now you understand the
situation more clearly,

192
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:15,145
perhaps you'd like to
discuss it with the President.

193
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,521
I will not speak with any one
nation or group of nations.

194
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:22,549
I don't intend to add my contribution to
your childish jealousies and suspicions.

195
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,889
Our problems are
very complex, Klaatu.

196
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:28,456
- You mustn't judge us too harshly.
- I can judge only by what I see.

197
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:32,829
- Your impatience is quite understandable.
- I'm impatient with stupidity.

198
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:37,202
- My people have learned to live without it.
- I'm afraid my people haven't.

199
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:39,887
I am very sorry.

200
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:42,496
I wish it were otherwise.

201
00:19:56,574 --> 00:20:00,985
Before making any decisions, I think
I should get out among your people,

202
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:05,742
and become familiar with the basis
for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

203
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,348
Under the circumstances,
I'm afraid that's impossible.

204
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,800
I must ask that you don't try
to leave the hospital.

205
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,447
Our military people
have insisted on this.

206
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:17,940
I'm sure you understand.

207
00:20:55,686 --> 00:21:00,021
- The man from the spaceship got away!
- What? Get every available man.

208
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:39,647
(reporter) Hospital authorities refuse
to comment on how he managed to escape...

209
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:44,825
(reporter #2) The descriptions of the creature
are denounced as rumour by the police chief.

210
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:48,508
He's not eight feet tall, as reported,
nor does he have tentacles...

211
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:51,385
(reporter #3) There's no denying
a monster is at large,

212
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:55,413
and we are dealing with forces
beyond our knowledge and power.

213
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:58,251
The public is advised to
take ordinary precautions

214
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:01,013
and to remain calm as we await...

215
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,652
(reporter #4) Officials have concluded
that this ship comes from some other planet.

216
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:10,756
Thus far, scientists have refused
to speak officially on just which planet,

217
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:13,442
until they've had an
opportunity to study the ship.

218
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:18,467
They seem to agree, however, that either
Venus or Mars is the most likely possibility.

219
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:20,788
Not only are these the
closest planets to Earth,

220
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:23,032
but all research to date indicates

221
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:26,637
they are the only two planets
capable of sustaining life as we know it.

222
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:32,238
However, all reputable scientists
warn against jumping to hasty conclusions.

223
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:35,192
Professor Havemeyer of MIT,
for example,

224
00:22:35,307 --> 00:22:38,529
points out it's possible,
in light of our meagre knowledge.

225
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:43,669
The President has urged all citizens to be on
the alert for any information about this man,

226
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:46,734
and to transmit such
information immediately

227
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:48,963
to the police, the army or the FBI.

228
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,108
While the President made no effort
to minimise the crisis,

229
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:55,714
he urged people all over
the country to remain calm.

230
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:59,627
And I might add, that though
this man may be our bitter enemy,

231
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:02,466
he could be also a new-found friend.

232
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:07,452
- Unfortunately, the only photos we have...
- Mom, do you think I could...?

233
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:10,483
- Hey, who's that?
-..do not show the man's face.

234
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,932
The President said the entire facilities
of the FBI and every other federal agency

235
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,812
are being brought to bear.

236
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:21,070
He pointed out, however,
that this is no ordinary manhunt.

237
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:25,635
He warned "We may be up against
powers that are beyond our control... "

238
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,754
- What is it you want?
- My name is Carpenter. I'm looking for a room.

239
00:23:39,137 --> 00:23:41,593
- Oh, I see.
- Are you an FBI man?

240
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:44,140
No, I'm afraid not.

241
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:46,963
I'll bet he is, Mom.
He's looking for the spaceman.

242
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,571
We've all been hearing
too much about spacemen.

243
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:52,218
- This is Mrs Benson, Mr Carpenter.
- How do you do?

244
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:54,290
And little Bobby.

245
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,819
- Mr and Mrs Barley. And Mr Krull.
- How do you do?

246
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,197
And I'm Mrs Crockett.

247
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:06,066
I have a very nice room on the second floor.
It gets the sun all day long.

248
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:09,518
Can I help you look for the spaceman?
I know what he looks like.

249
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:12,427
He's got a big square head
with three great big eyes.

250
00:24:12,428 --> 00:24:15,388
That's enough, Bobby.
It's late. Excuse me.

251
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:19,607
We mustn't annoy Mr Carpenter,
or he won't want to stay here.

252
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:23,558
He's really a dear little boy,
and quiet as a mouse.

253
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:28,008
- You're a long way from home, aren't you?
- How did you know?

254
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:31,460
Oh. I can tell a New England accent
a mile away.

255
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:39,017
(radio) Now we take you to Miami Beach,
Florida, for a report from Gabriel Heatter.

256
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:40,475
Mr Heatter?

257
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:44,042
(Heatter) And now on this Sunday morning
we asks some questions

258
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,495
that have been haunting
the entire nation for two whole days.

259
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:52,021
This creature: where is he?
What is he up to?

260
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:55,435
If he can build a spaceship
that can fly to Earth,

261
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:58,964
and a robot that can
destroy our tanks and guns,

262
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,493
what other terrors
can he unleash at will?

263
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,063
Obviously, the monster must be found.

264
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,557
He must be tracked
down like a wild animal.

265
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:09,628
He must be destroyed.

266
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:12,429
But where would
such a creature hide?

267
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,114
Would he disappear
into the north woods?

268
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,988
Would he crawl into the sewers
of some great city?

269
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:22,479
Everybody agrees
there is grave danger.

270
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:26,468
The question remains:
what can we do to protect ourselves?

271
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:31,877
What measures can we take to neutralise
this menace from another world?

272
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:34,716
Destroy it?
Of course, but how?

273
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:39,280
And if we do destroy it,
what do we face in retaliation?

274
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,849
It's not a simple problem...

275
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,152
George, turn it off that radio,
I'm trying to concentrate.

276
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:46,645
Why doesn't the
government do something?

277
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:49,101
What can they do?
They're only people, like us.

278
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,709
People, my foot!
They're Democrats.

279
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:53,589
It's enough to give you the shakes.

280
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:57,693
He's got that robot standing there,
just waiting for orders to destroy us.

281
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:02,526
This spaceman, or whatever he is.
We automatically assume he's a menace.

282
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,288
- Maybe he isn't at all.
- Then what's he hiding for?

283
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:09,124
- Why doesn't he come out in the open?
- Like Heatter says, "What's he up to?"

284
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,116
- Maybe he's afraid.
- He's afraid!

285
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:16,067
Well, after all, he was shot
the minute he landed here.

286
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:18,205
I was just wondering
what I would do.

287
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:20,862
Perhaps before deciding
on a course of action,

288
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:23,081
you'd want to know
more about the people,

289
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,235
to orient yourself in
a strange environment.

290
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:28,499
There's nothing strange
about Washington, Mr Capenter.

291
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,874
A person from another
planet may disagree.

292
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:35,017
If you want my opinion,
he comes from right here on Earth.

293
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,897
And you know where I mean.

294
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:40,311
They wouldn't come in a spaceship.
They'd come in airplanes.

295
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:42,612
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

296
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,911
That fellow wants something,
otherwise he wouldn't be here.

297
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:48,405
That right, Mr Carpenter?

298
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,284
I must be a little confused.

299
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:53,813
Oh, Mrs Benson,
Mr Stevens is here to see you.

300
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,153
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.

301
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,181
George, finish your coffee.
I promised the Carsons I'd be there at 11.

302
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:03,940
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

303
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:07,593
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches,
I put gas in the car

304
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:10,538
and the radio's still on the blink,
so we can forget about the spaceman for a day.

305
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:13,569
There's one thing.
I haven't anyone to stay with Bobby.

306
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:17,443
- I don't suppose we could take him with us?
- Well... Well, we could.

307
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,742
There's always someone here,
but today they've all got plans.

308
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:23,005
I haven't any plans.

309
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:26,880
I'd be happy to spend the day with him,
if you'd let me.

310
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:30,064
Say, that would be great.
Wouldn't it?

311
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,595
It's awfully nice of you to suggest it.

312
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:34,857
Sorry. Mr Carpenter,
this is Tom Stevens.

313
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:36,470
How do you do, Mr Carpenter?

314
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:37,966
Hello.

315
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,526
Bobby and I had a fine
time yesterday afternoon.

316
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:42,300
We talked and
listened to the radio.

317
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:45,868
I thought today he might like
to show me around the city.

318
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,819
- Well...
- Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it?

319
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,698
Fine.

320
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,419
- You think it's all right?
- Sure.

321
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:11,454
That's my father.
He was killed at Anzio.

322
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:30,672
Did all those people die in wars?

323
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:34,048
Most of 'em. Didn't you ever
hear of the Arlington Cemetery?

324
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:35,569
No, I'm afraid not.

325
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,612
You don't seem to
know much of anything.

326
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:42,947
Well, I'll tell you, Bobby,
I've been away a long time. Very far away.

327
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:46,515
Is it different where you've been?
Don't they have places like this?

328
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,046
They have cemeteries,
but not like this one.

329
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,655
You see, they don't have any wars.

330
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,033
Gee, that's a good idea.

331
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,677
- What would you like to do?
- Go to the movies.

332
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,557
- All right.
- No fooling?

333
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:02,012
No fooling.

334
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:06,155
Bobby, tell me, do you have
to have money to go there?

335
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:10,873
- I've got two dollars. Mom gave it to me.
- No. I want to take you to the movie.

336
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,057
Do you think they'd accept these?

337
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:17,548
Gee, they look like diamonds!

338
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:20,310
In some places,
those are what people use for money.

339
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:22,837
They're easier to carry
and don't wear out.

340
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:25,066
I'll bet they're worth
a million dollars.

341
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:27,445
Would you give me your
$2 for two of these?

342
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,902
Well...

343
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:30,782
Sure.

344
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,470
OK.

345
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:37,034
Let's not say anything to Mom
about this, though.

346
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:40,909
- Why not, Bobby?
- She doesn't like me to steal from people.

347
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,226
Those are great words.

348
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:10,638
- He must have been a great man.
- Well, sure.

349
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:25,790
That's the kind of man
I'd like to talk to.

350
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:30,546
Bobby, who's the greatest man
in America today?

351
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:32,810
I don't know. The spaceman, I guess.

352
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:35,373
No, I was speaking of earthmen.

353
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:37,758
I meant the greatest
philosopher or greatest thinker.

354
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,170
You mean the smartest
man in the world?

355
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,863
Yes, that would do nicely.

356
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,096
Professor Barnhardt, I guess.

357
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:44,970
He's the greatest scientist
in the whole world.

358
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:48,422
- He lives here in Washington?
- Near where Mom works.

359
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:51,529
- Where's that?
- Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.

360
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:56,593
That man they call the secretary isn't at all.
My mom's a real secretary.

361
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:00,275
Mr Carpenter,
now can we go see the spaceship?

362
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,347
If you like.

363
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:19,033
I'll bet that iron guy's strong
and could knock down a whole building.

364
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,335
I shouldn't be at all surprised.

365
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,416
I'd like to get inside
that ship, see how it works.

366
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,091
What do you think makes it go?

367
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:29,774
A highly developed form
of atomic power, I should imagine.

368
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:31,845
I thought that was only for bombs.

369
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,144
No. No, it's for lots
of other things, too.

370
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:37,720
Do you think it can go
faster than the F-86?

371
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:38,942
Yes, I should think so.

372
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:42,471
- About 1,000 miles an hour?
- Maybe 4,000 miles an hour.

373
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:45,808
And outside the Earth's atmosphere,
a good deal faster.

374
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:47,880
How could they make a landing?

375
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:50,872
There are several ways
to reduce landing speed.

376
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:54,976
You see, the basic problem
is to overcome the inertia...

377
00:31:55,053 --> 00:31:57,662
Keep going, mister.
He was fallin' for it!

378
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:06,906
Thank you, Mrs Robinson. I'm sure we've all
shared your fears during the past few days.

379
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:11,203
I see a gentleman here with his little boy.
What do you think of the spaceship, son?

380
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,080
It's the biggest spaceship I ever saw.

381
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:18,222
- And you, sir. Mind telling us your name?
- My name is Carpenter.

382
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,007
Would you care to say a
few words, Mr Carpenter?

383
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:22,519
I suppose you're just as
scared as the rest of us.

384
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,168
In a different way, perhaps.

385
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:28,618
I am fearful when I see people substituting
fear for reason. In fact, I would...

386
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:31,245
Uh, thank you, Mr Carpenter.
Thank you very much.

387
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:33,183
I see another gentleman
over here in the crowd...

388
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:37,095
Extra! Extra! Spaceman eludes police!
Army put in charge.

389
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:39,819
Read all about it!
Spaceman eludes police!

390
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,890
Extra! Extra!

391
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:46,532
Get your paper here.
Army put in charge.

392
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,872
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

393
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:51,231
You think they'll ever find him?

394
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:54,511
I don't know, Bobby.
I'm inclined to doubt it.

395
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:57,311
Mr Carpenter, what is inertia?

396
00:32:57,388 --> 00:33:00,533
The property of matter by which
it remains in uniform motion

397
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,912
unless acted upon by external force.

398
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:04,369
Oh.

399
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:08,359
I'll bet that's just the way
Professor Barnhardt talks.

400
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:10,046
Bobby, I have an idea.

401
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:14,282
Let's go and see Professor Barnhardt
and find out how he talks.

402
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,225
You're kidding!

403
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:19,483
- Wouldn't you like to meet him?
- Sure I would, but I bet you'd be scared.

404
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:22,859
Maybe we can scare him
more than he can scare us.

405
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:26,349
I like you, Mr Carpenter.
You're a real screwball.

406
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:32,257
(newsboy) Extra! Extra!
Spaceman still at large.

407
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:36,323
Extra! Read all about it.
Get your paper here.

408
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,099
Maybe he isn't home.

409
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:57,536
Gee, I'll bet you
this is where he works.

410
00:34:17,943 --> 00:34:20,207
What's that stuff on
the blackboard mean?

411
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:22,662
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

412
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:25,308
I'll bet he's the only one
that knows the answer.

413
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:28,991
He doesn't know the answer.
And he'll never get it that way.

414
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:35,589
We probably couldn't get to
see him even if he was home.

415
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:40,461
(door opens)

416
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,455
Hey, where are you going?

417
00:34:42,532 --> 00:34:46,215
If he's that difficult to see,
perhaps we ought to leave a calling card.

418
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:02,441
Did he do it wrong?

419
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,512
He just needs a little help.

420
00:35:17,938 --> 00:35:20,125
What are you doing in here?

421
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:25,226
How dare you write
on that blackboard!

422
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:28,602
Do you realise the professor's
worked on that problem for weeks?

423
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,095
He'll solve it in no time now.

424
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:34,778
- How did you get in? What do you want?
- To see Professor Barnhardt.

425
00:35:34,855 --> 00:35:38,422
Well, he's not here.
And he won't be back till this evening.

426
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,713
I think you'd better leave now.

427
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:54,533
Would you give this to the professor?

428
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,988
I think he'll want to talk to me.

429
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:12,524
I wouldn't erase that.
The professor needs it very badly.

430
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,335
(rings doorbell)

431
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,281
- Mr Carpenter come home yet?
- Yeah, he's inside.

432
00:36:46,357 --> 00:36:49,119
- Tell him I'd like to see him.
- OK. Come on in.

433
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,640
- Your name Carpenter?
- Yes.

434
00:36:55,717 --> 00:37:00,282
- Professor Barnhardt been looking for me?
- I've been looking for you all afternoon.

435
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:09,603
Thank you.

436
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:16,470
- It was a wonderful day.
- You still haven't answered my question.

437
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:21,725
You know how I feel, Tom,
but I just want to think it over.

438
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:23,608
Boss goes to Chicago tomorrow.

439
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,980
If I could tell him I was getting
marryed and had dependants...

440
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:30,740
You're a good salesman,
but I've got to think about it.

441
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:35,036
A good insurance salesman wouldn't
give you time to think about it.

442
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:38,872
- Good night.
- Night.

443
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,229
- Hiya, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

444
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:52,144
- Good evening, Mr Carpenter.
- Good evening.

445
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:55,290
- Uh, Mrs Benson, this is Mr Brady.
- How do you do?

446
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,553
Mr Brady's a government agent!

447
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:03,000
- Have a nice day, dear?
- We had a swell time, didn't we?

448
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:04,074
Yes.

449
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:08,601
We went to the movies and had ice-cream
cones, and then we went to see Daddy.

450
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:12,552
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I enjoyed every minute of it.

451
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:15,237
We better get going, Mr Carpenter.

452
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:19,035
Aw, gee, you didn't finish your story.

453
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:21,643
I'll finish it tomorrow.
Good night, Bobby.

454
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,715
- Good night.
- Good night.

455
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:33,842
Come on, dear.
Time to go to bed.

456
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:38,905
Why did Mr Carpenter
have to go with Mr Brady?

457
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,207
I don't know.
Maybe it was a mistake.

458
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:42,626
Oh.

459
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:44,784
We sure had fun today.

460
00:38:44,785 --> 00:38:47,843
We saw the spaceship and we
went to see Professor Barnhardt.

461
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,413
- Professor Barnhardt?
- Yeah, sure.

462
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,748
- Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
- Yes, of course, dear.

463
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:58,277
Gee. I was hoping I could
go out with Mr Carpenter again.

464
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:04,146
(doorbell)

465
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:08,749
Oh, come in.
The professor's in his study.

466
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:10,820
Thank you.

467
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,843
(knocks)

468
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:21,830
This is the man you
wanted to see, Professor.

469
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:24,515
- Thank you, Captain.
- I'll wait outside.

470
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:30,231
- You wrote this?
- It was a clumsy way to introduce myself.

471
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:33,184
But I understand you're
a difficult man to see.

472
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:35,536
I thought you'd have
the solution by now.

473
00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:37,826
Not yet. That's why
I wanted to see you.

474
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:41,432
All you have to do now is to
substitute this expression at this point.

475
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:43,663
That will reproduce
the first-order term.

476
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:45,920
But what about the
effect of the other terms?

477
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:50,063
Almost negligible. With variation
of parameters, this is the answer.

478
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:53,553
How can you be so sure?
Have you tested this theory?

479
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:58,425
I find it works well enough
to get me from one planet to another.

480
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:03,488
I am Klaatu.

481
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:08,936
I spent two days at your
Walter Reed Hospital, room 309.

482
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:11,621
My doctor's name was Major White.

483
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,531
If you're not interested or if you
intend to turn me over to your army,

484
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:18,602
we needn't waste any more time.

485
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:30,839
You may go now, Captain.
Please thank General Cutler,

486
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:34,100
and tell him...
tell him that I know this gentleman.

487
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,511
You have faith.

488
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:42,577
It isn't faith that makes good science,
Mr Klaatu. It's curiosity.

489
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:44,764
Sit down, please.

490
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,945
There are several thousand questions
I'd like to ask you.

491
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:54,354
- I'd like to explain something of my mission.
- That was my first question.

492
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:00,108
We know from observation that your planet
has discovered a rudimentary atomic energy.

493
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:05,056
- And that you're experimenting with rockets.
- Yes, that is true.

494
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:10,273
While you were limited to fighting among
yourselves with primitive tanks and aircraft,

495
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,114
we were unconcerned.

496
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:16,257
But soon one of your nations
will apply atomic energy to spaceships.

497
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:20,592
That will create a threat to the
peace and security of other planets.

498
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,970
That, of course,
we cannot tolerate.

499
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:26,346
What exactly is the nature
of your mission, Mr Klaatu?

500
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:29,568
I came here to warn you
that by threatening danger,

501
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:33,557
your planet faces danger,
very grave danger.

502
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:36,144
I'm prepared, however,
to offer a solution.

503
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,084
Would you care to be more specific?

504
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,805
What I have to say must
be said to all concerned.

505
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:45,679
It is too important to be
entrusted to any individual.

506
00:41:51,395 --> 00:41:54,962
I gather that your efforts on the
official level were not successful.

507
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,680
I come to you as a last resort,
and I confess my patience is wearing thin.

508
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:02,496
Must I take drastic action
in order to get a hearing?

509
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,475
What... what sort of
action do you mean?

510
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:09,117
Violent action, since that seems to be
the only thing your people understand.

511
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:13,605
Levelling New York City perhaps,
or sinking the Rock of Gibraltar.

512
00:42:20,932 --> 00:42:24,307
Would you meet with the group
of scientists I'm calling together?

513
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:26,505
You could explain
your mission to them

514
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:29,332
and they, in turn, could
present it to their various peoples.

515
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:31,787
That's why I came to see you.

516
00:42:31,864 --> 00:42:34,473
It is not enough to
have men of science.

517
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:37,695
We scientists are too often
ignored or misunderstood.

518
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:42,490
We must get leaders from every field -
the finest minds in the world.

519
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,561
I leave that in your hands.

520
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:48,090
One thing, Mr Klaatu.

521
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:53,154
Suppose this group should reject
your proposals. What is the alternative?

522
00:42:53,231 --> 00:42:55,762
I'm afraid there is no alternative.

523
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,601
In such a case,
the planet Earth would have to be...

524
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:00,903
eliminated.

525
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,319
Such power exists?

526
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:06,541
I assure you, such power exists.

527
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:11,912
The people who come to the meeting
must be made to realise this.

528
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,597
They must understand what is at stake.

529
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:18,433
- You mentioned a demonstration of force.
- Yes.

530
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,962
- Would one be possible before the meeting?
- Yes, of course.

531
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,335
Something to dramatise for them and
their people the seriousness of the situation.

532
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,209
- Something to affect the entire planet.
- That can easily be arranged.

533
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:33,508
I wouldn't want you to harm
anybody or destroy anything.

534
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:36,194
Leave it to me.
I'll think of something.

535
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,032
Maybe a little demonstration.

536
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:42,868
Something dramatic,
but not destructive.

537
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:47,011
That's quite an
interesting problem.

538
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:50,387
Would the day after tomorrow
be all right, say about noon?

539
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:00,859
(radio) There are no
further developments,

540
00:44:00,936 --> 00:44:05,769
but police and the FBI are tracing every
possible clue and rounding up all suspects...

541
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:07,687
- Rummy!
- Oh, my.

542
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:09,605
Did it again!

543
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:13,211
- Take a hand, Mr Carpenter?
- Take a...? Oh.

544
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:16,318
No, thanks.
We don't... No, thanks.

545
00:44:17,315 --> 00:44:20,422
- Are you going out, dear?
- Yes. Tom's picking me up.

546
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:23,836
Personally, I wouldn't go out
after dark these days.

547
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:27,097
But then I'm not courting, am I?

548
00:44:31,278 --> 00:44:32,276
Oh!

549
00:44:32,352 --> 00:44:34,347
Oh, Mr Carpenter.

550
00:44:40,523 --> 00:44:42,710
Everyone seems so...

551
00:44:43,592 --> 00:44:45,778
"Jittery" is the word.

552
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:50,535
Bobby's the only person I know
who isn't... jittery.

553
00:44:50,612 --> 00:44:52,952
He has his homework
to keep him occupied.

554
00:44:53,028 --> 00:44:56,404
- He's a fine boy, Mrs Benson.
- Naturally, I think so.

555
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:59,089
Warm, friendly, intelligent.

556
00:45:00,278 --> 00:45:02,848
Mr Carpenter...

557
00:45:02,963 --> 00:45:06,723
This is none of my business,
but why did that man come here last night?

558
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:09,638
They just wanted to
ask me a few questions.

559
00:45:09,715 --> 00:45:13,858
Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt
in the afternoon. He wasn't in.

560
00:45:13,934 --> 00:45:17,579
Apparently they thought
I was looking for secrets of some kind.

561
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:19,880
(doorbell)

562
00:45:19,957 --> 00:45:21,952
Excuse me.

563
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:28,626
(#* tinksling melody)

564
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:32,577
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you ready?

565
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:35,262
- In a minute.
- The picture starts at 8:50.

566
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:38,638
- I was with Mr Carpenter.
- I hope he won't think I'm intruding.

567
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:40,518
- Sh!
- What...

568
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:45,121
Good evening. Excuse me,
I was just going up to my room.

569
00:45:45,198 --> 00:45:48,573
- Good night, Mr Carpenter.
- Have a good time, both of you.

570
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,568
(both) Thank you.

571
00:45:50,683 --> 00:45:54,672
Why don't you wait in here while
I get my things? Tom, that was awful.

572
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:57,396
- I'm just tired of hearing about Mr Carpenter.
- Tom!

573
00:45:57,473 --> 00:45:59,624
I don't like how he's attached
himself to you and Bobby.

574
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:02,575
After all, what do you know about him?

575
00:46:04,224 --> 00:46:06,219
I'll go get my things.

576
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:24,325
All you have to remember is first find
the common denominator, and then divide.

577
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,626
Thanks, Mr Carpenter.

578
00:46:27,624 --> 00:46:30,309
- I'll say good night again.
- Mr Carpenter...

579
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:32,188
I...

580
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:36,293
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Benson.

581
00:46:38,057 --> 00:46:41,126
- Bed now. You can finish that in the morning.
- OK.

582
00:46:45,384 --> 00:46:47,571
Bobby.

583
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:52,442
I think it would be better if we didn't
see quite so much of Mr Carpenter.

584
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:56,393
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend,
and he's awful good in arithmetic.

585
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,887
He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

586
00:46:59,002 --> 00:47:01,342
Did you really go to
see Professor Barnhardt?

587
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,142
Sure we did. He wasn't there,
but we went to see him.

588
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:07,518
And Mr Carpenter showed him
how to do his arithmetic.

589
00:47:09,397 --> 00:47:12,505
Mom, is something wrong
with Mr Carpenter?

590
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:15,190
- What do you mean, dear?
- On account of last night.

591
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:18,719
You think he's a bank robber,
or a gangster maybe?

592
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:21,903
No, dear, of course not.
He's a very nice man.

593
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:26,506
I just think that he might prefer
to be left alone, that's all.

594
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,846
Now you go to bed
and forget about it.

595
00:47:28,923 --> 00:47:31,186
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

596
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:34,561
Mom?

597
00:47:35,827 --> 00:47:37,899
Why would he wanna be left alone?

598
00:47:38,896 --> 00:47:41,083
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

599
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:05,441
(train whistle blows)

600
00:48:07,934 --> 00:48:10,466
- Bobby, have you a flashlight?
- Yeah.

601
00:48:14,532 --> 00:48:16,604
- It's a real Boy Scout one.
- Fine.

602
00:48:18,905 --> 00:48:21,821
- Here. All you gotta do is push up on it.
- Oh.

603
00:48:21,897 --> 00:48:25,503
- What do you need it for?
- I've, uh... The light in my room went out.

604
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,577
Oh.

605
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,643
I must tell you sometime about a kind
of train that doesn't need any tracks.

606
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:32,140
- Really?
- Really.

607
00:48:32,216 --> 00:48:35,016
- Remind me in the morning to tell you.
- OK.

608
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,714
No tracks.

609
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:45,161
Gort! Baringa!

610
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:25,126
(alien language)

611
00:54:39,473 --> 00:54:41,544
(Mrs Benson) Come in for a minute.

612
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,224
- Bobby, what are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep. I had to tell you.

613
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:49,140
- Tell me what?
- After you left, I followed Mr Carpenter,

614
00:54:49,255 --> 00:54:52,439
and where do you think he went?
Right into the spaceship!

615
00:54:52,515 --> 00:54:55,546
- Now, Bobby, wait a minute.
- Honest, Mom. I saw him.

616
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:59,612
It opened up and he walked in.
That big iron fella was walking around, too.

617
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:02,949
- Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
- No, I haven't, Mom.

618
00:55:03,026 --> 00:55:05,941
Honest. I promise you, I saw him!

619
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:09,279
- Where'd you see all this?
- On the lawn down at the Mall.

620
00:55:09,355 --> 00:55:13,038
- In that place with the soldiers out in front.
- Where were the soldiers?

621
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:15,800
That big iron guy grabbed 'em
and knocked 'em out.

622
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:18,677
I like Mr Carpenter, Mom,
but I'm kinda scared.

623
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:20,863
Don't be frightened.
It was only a bad dream.

624
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:22,973
Here, we'll prove it to you.

625
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,658
- Tom, ask Mr Carpenter to come down.
- Sure.

626
00:55:25,773 --> 00:55:28,650
- He's in the room next to mine.
- OK.

627
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:33,867
Think back. You didn't follow Mr Carpenter at all, did you?
You haven't even been outside.

628
00:55:33,944 --> 00:55:36,514
- Yes, I have!
- You didn't really see a spaceship,

629
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:39,813
- but you thought you did.
- I'd never call you a liar.

630
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:30,371
He's not there,
but look what I found in his room.

631
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:32,596
- Is it real?
- It looks real to me.

632
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:36,662
Mr Carpenter's got lots of diamonds.
He gave me a couple of 'em.

633
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,345
- He gave these to you?
- Well, not exactly.

634
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:43,260
I gave him two dollars.

635
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,984
This doesn't make sense.

636
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,611
I think he's a crook.
I never did trust him.

637
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:51,162
Gee, you think he's
a diamond smuggler?

638
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:53,502
- You're going to bed now.
- I wonder if we...

639
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:56,993
Bobby and I have had
enough excitement for tonight.

640
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:00,867
- Do you think it's all right to stay here?
- I've got a good lock on my door.

641
00:57:00,944 --> 00:57:03,034
Bobby's gonna sleep
in my room tonight.

642
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:05,125
Come on now, up to bed with you.

643
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:07,465
Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

644
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:09,537
Yeah. The grass was kinda wet.

645
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:19,203
- I'm going now, Helen.
- All right.

646
00:57:31,632 --> 00:57:34,432
- Hello.
- May I see you for a minute?

647
00:57:34,509 --> 00:57:37,539
- Well, I'm just going to lunch.
- May I walk out with you?

648
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:39,611
- Well...
- (phone rings)

649
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:46,285
Mrs Benson speaking.

650
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,398
Oh, hello.

651
00:57:47,474 --> 00:57:50,927
I'm getting an appraisal on that diamond.
Can we lunch together?

652
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,804
Can I talk to you later?

653
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:56,259
Oh, that'll be fine. Bye.

654
00:58:07,575 --> 00:58:10,107
I saw Bobby this morning
before he went to school.

655
00:58:10,183 --> 00:58:13,291
- Yes?
- I'd like to know what he told you last night.

656
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,233
I really didn't pay much attention.

657
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:17,165
Bobby has such an
active imagination.

658
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,310
Did you believe what he told you?

659
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:23,916
I have a reason for asking this.
A very important reason.

660
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:28,788
There's another elevator we can use.

661
00:58:39,222 --> 00:58:43,096
- What is it you want?
- Before I ask you to be honest with me,

662
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:47,009
perhaps I should be
completely honest with you.

663
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:49,502
- What happened?
- What time is it?

664
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:53,377
Just 12:00.

665
00:58:53,453 --> 00:58:57,059
We shall be here for a little while.
About 30 minutes.

666
00:58:58,632 --> 00:59:02,084
- We can try pushing the other buttons.
- They won't work.

667
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:07,224
- Why not?
- You see, the electricity's been neutralised...

668
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:09,296
all over the world.

669
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:13,477
Bobby was telling the truth, wasn't he?

670
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:14,935
Yes.

671
00:59:41,595 --> 00:59:43,896
It's that spaceman.
That's what it is.

672
00:59:49,228 --> 00:59:51,300
(mutters in French)

673
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,591
(mutters in Russian)

674
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:53,136
You should see it!
You should go out and see it for yourself!

675
01:00:53,213 --> 01:00:55,284
Thanks.
I am enjoying it right here.

676
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:58,391
The city has stopped.
People are running around like ants.

677
01:00:58,468 --> 01:01:02,304
What a brilliant idea.
I never would have thought of it.

678
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:06,101
The people who are coming to
the meeting tonight, have they arrived?

679
01:01:06,178 --> 01:01:10,475
Yes. I talked to them on the phone.
They're all very curious about the meeting.

680
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:13,428
Good. Did you speak to
our friend Mr Carpenter?

681
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:15,500
He'll be there at 8:30.

682
01:01:15,576 --> 01:01:20,755
Tell me, Hilda, does all this frighten you?
Does it make you feel insecure?

683
01:01:20,832 --> 01:01:24,706
- Yes, sir. It certainly does.
- That's good, Hilda.

684
01:01:24,783 --> 01:01:26,777
I'm glad.

685
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:31,918
As far as we can tell, power's been cut off
everywhere, with a few exceptions.

686
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:36,904
And even these exceptions are remarkable...
hospitals, planes in flight, that sort of thing.

687
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:40,625
I wish I could tell you more but,
as you know, all communications are out -

688
01:01:40,702 --> 01:01:44,308
telephones, radio, cable, everything.

689
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:51,328
I can tell you the President is prepared
to declare a state of national emergency.

690
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,986
- Eleanor, did you call the electrician?
- I tried, but the phone doesn't work either.

691
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:07,784
- Well, call the phone company.
- But the phone doesn't work!

692
01:02:10,968 --> 01:02:14,650
- Is it worth anything?
- I have never seen such a stone in all my life.

693
01:02:14,727 --> 01:02:18,295
- Will you tell me where it came from?
- That's what I want you to tell me.

694
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:22,207
But there are no diamonds like this
anyplace in the world that I know of.

695
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:25,468
- Are you sure of that?
- Uh, would you like to sell it?

696
01:02:25,545 --> 01:02:27,654
No. No, thanks.

697
01:02:27,731 --> 01:02:30,647
- I'd give you a very good price.
- Thank you, no.

698
01:02:32,564 --> 01:02:38,127
I've told you more than I told Barnhardt
because, in a sense, my life is in your hands.

699
01:02:38,203 --> 01:02:43,881
I thought if you knew the facts, you'd see
the importance of the meeting tonight.

700
01:02:43,996 --> 01:02:46,566
Of course. Of course I do.

701
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:52,473
- You hold great hope for this meeting.
- I can see no other hope for your planet.

702
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:56,309
If this meeting should fail,
then I'm afraid there is no hope.

703
01:02:57,345 --> 01:02:59,762
It must be 12:30.

704
01:03:01,795 --> 01:03:03,483
Yes.

705
01:03:03,598 --> 01:03:05,554
Just exactly.

706
01:03:08,316 --> 01:03:10,617
(horns blaring)

707
01:03:25,616 --> 01:03:28,071
- Where are you going now?
- The boarding house.

708
01:03:28,186 --> 01:03:30,353
I'll be safe there for today.
I can watch Bobby.

709
01:03:30,354 --> 01:03:32,521
He's the only other
person who knows...

710
01:03:32,598 --> 01:03:35,053
- No, wait. There's someone else.
- Who?

711
01:03:35,129 --> 01:03:38,121
Tom. He was there last night
when Bobby told me what he saw.

712
01:03:38,198 --> 01:03:43,070
- Do you think he'd tell anyone?
- I think he'd talk to me first anyway, before...

713
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:46,714
Well, we can't take any chance.

714
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:49,207
I'll get in touch with him
right away to make sure.

715
01:03:50,972 --> 01:03:54,693
But I've got to talk to him. It's important.
When is he coming back?

716
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,572
I don't know, Mrs Benson.

717
01:03:56,649 --> 01:04:00,063
He left before noon,
before that awful electric business.

718
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,595
I'm scared to death, Mrs Benson. I...

719
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:06,891
No, he wouldn't tell me where he was going.
He said it was something personal.

720
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,037
Well, please ask him to call me
the minute he gets in.

721
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:11,916
Thanks.

722
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:19,857
Before we discuss plans, I want a report
from Colonel Ryder. What about the robot?

723
01:04:19,934 --> 01:04:22,542
When it was discovered
that the robot had moved,

724
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:26,301
I was directed by the Joint Chiefs
to find a means of immobilising him.

725
01:04:26,378 --> 01:04:30,713
We accomplished that this morning
by encasing him in a block of KL93,

726
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:33,206
a new plastic material stronger than steel.

727
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:36,850
- Isn't it possible he's broken out?
- No, sir. We just checked on that.

728
01:04:36,927 --> 01:04:40,878
- He's locked up tight as a drum.
- All right. Now we concentrate on the man.

729
01:04:40,955 --> 01:04:44,791
Up till now we've agreed upon
the desirability of capturing this man alive.

730
01:04:44,906 --> 01:04:47,629
We can no longer afford
to be so particular.

731
01:04:47,706 --> 01:04:51,274
We'll get him, alive if possible,
but we must get him.

732
01:04:51,964 --> 01:04:53,959
- Is that clear?
- (all) Yes, sir.

733
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,129
Honest, Mary,
I'm so scared I can't sit still.

734
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:35,579
I'd like to run someplace,
but I don't know where to go. Bye now.

735
01:05:35,656 --> 01:05:37,708
Margaret, call the Pentagon.

736
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:39,760
Find out who's in charge
of this spaceman business.

737
01:05:39,837 --> 01:05:44,670
- Whoever it is, I wanna talk to him.
- Mrs Benson called. She says it's important.

738
01:05:44,785 --> 01:05:46,780
Get this other call first.

739
01:05:51,268 --> 01:05:53,685
- Oh, Mrs Benson, he just walked in.
- Fine.

740
01:05:53,762 --> 01:05:55,910
- Are you nervous, too?
- Yes, I am.

741
01:05:56,025 --> 01:06:00,436
- Helen, come on in.
- I've been trying to get you all afternoon.

742
01:06:00,513 --> 01:06:03,505
I have some terrific
news about Mr Carpenter.

743
01:06:03,582 --> 01:06:05,730
- What about him?
- He's the spaceman.

744
01:06:05,807 --> 01:06:10,256
I had that diamond checked at three places.
Nobody's ever seen a stone like that.

745
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,942
After what Bobby told us,
that's enough for me.

746
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:15,972
Why is it nobody knows about him?
Why hasn't he got money?

747
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:18,811
All right, Tom, it's true.
I know it's true.

748
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:21,573
- You... How do you know?
- Never mind about that.

749
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:25,255
- Promise you won't say a word to anybody.
- After what happened today?!

750
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:29,168
- You don't realise how important this is.
- Of course it's important.

751
01:06:29,245 --> 01:06:33,848
- And we can do something about it.
- That's what I'm saying. We must do nothing.

752
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:37,300
- Believe me.
- He's a menace. It's our duty to turn him in.

753
01:06:37,377 --> 01:06:40,522
But he isn't a menace.
He told me why he came here.

754
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:43,246
He told... He told you?

755
01:06:43,323 --> 01:06:46,621
Oh, don't be silly, honey,
just because you like the guy.

756
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,923
You realise what this'd mean to us?

757
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,603
- I'd be the biggest man in the country.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

758
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,828
- Somebody has to get rid of him.
- (phone)

759
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:57,132
I won't let you do it.

760
01:06:57,209 --> 01:06:58,782
- Yes?
- This is important...

761
01:06:58,897 --> 01:07:03,998
What's his name, Margaret?
General Cutler. Yes. Oh, all right, I'll hold on.

762
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:06,146
You mustn't. It isn't
just you and Mr Carpenter.

763
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,218
The rest of the world is involved.

764
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:10,711
I don't care about the rest of the world.

765
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:16,389
You'll feel different when you
see my picture in the papers.

766
01:07:16,504 --> 01:07:19,956
- I feel different now.
- You wait. You're gonna marry a big hero.

767
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:24,022
- I'm not going to marry anybody.
- Helen, I... Hello, General Cutler?

768
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:27,743
No, I don't want to speak to his aide.
I want to speak to the general.

769
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:29,930
Tell him it's about the spaceman.

770
01:07:38,944 --> 01:07:41,361
That's right.
That's where he's staying.

771
01:07:41,438 --> 01:07:44,200
- Yes, of course I'm sure.
- Thank you, Mr Stevens.

772
01:07:44,276 --> 01:07:47,115
I'll want to talk to you further,
but I haven't time now.

773
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:50,989
Deploy all Zone Five units
according to Plan B. Immediately!

774
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:39,284
- Hello, Mrs Benson.
- Hello, Sammy.

775
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:50,984
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.

776
01:08:51,099 --> 01:08:53,899
When deployed
according to Plan Baker,

777
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:58,272
maintain station and remain on
radio alert until further orders.

778
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:49,636
I'm sure Barnhardt can
hide me until the meeting.

779
01:09:49,713 --> 01:09:52,705
- Where's the meeting going to be?
- At the ship.

780
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,267
Yeah, they got in a taxicab
and went off down that street.

781
01:09:58,344 --> 01:10:00,339
Thank you, son.

782
01:10:02,372 --> 01:10:05,210
Attention, Zone Five.
Attention, Zone Five.

783
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:08,816
Yellow cab moving north
on 14th Street from Harvard Street.

784
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:12,000
Man and woman in back seat.
Get licence number and report.

785
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:22,165
That's the one!

786
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:32,024
Right. Attention, Zone Five.
Licence number of target vehicle is H0012.

787
01:10:32,522 --> 01:10:34,747
Hey.
Looks like something big's going on.

788
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,656
Attention Zone Five.
Attention Zone Five.

789
01:10:47,657 --> 01:10:50,168
Report when target vehicle
passes your position.

790
01:11:05,665 --> 01:11:09,540
- It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
- I'm worried about Gort.

791
01:11:09,616 --> 01:11:13,145
I'm afraid of what he might do
if anything should happen to me.

792
01:11:13,222 --> 01:11:16,828
Gort? But he's a robot.
Without you, what could he do?

793
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:19,206
There's no limit
to what he could do.

794
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:21,278
He could destroy the Earth.

795
01:11:23,618 --> 01:11:27,415
If anything should happen to me,
you must go to Gort.

796
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,295
You must say these words:

797
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,671
Klaatu barada nikto.

798
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:34,742
Please repeat that.

799
01:11:35,432 --> 01:11:37,504
Klaatu...

800
01:11:37,581 --> 01:11:39,614
barada nikto.

801
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,723
You must remember those words.

802
01:11:43,641 --> 01:11:45,636
(murmurs) Klaatu

803
01:11:45,713 --> 01:11:47,554
barada

804
01:11:47,631 --> 01:11:48,628
nikto.

805
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:57,413
Yellow cab, licence number H0012, heading
west on 15th Street at Treasury Place.

806
01:12:03,205 --> 01:12:06,619
The target vehicle is turning west
into Massachusetts Avenue.

807
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:12,296
Yellow cab at
Columbia Road and Connecticut.

808
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,828
Repeat, Columbia Road and Connecticut.

809
01:12:16,247 --> 01:12:19,546
Attention, all units,
northwest area, Zone Five.

810
01:12:19,623 --> 01:12:25,339
Block off all streets intersecting Connecticut
Avenue on a line from Wisconsin to the park.

811
01:12:25,415 --> 01:12:27,487
All vehicles close in.

812
01:12:27,563 --> 01:12:29,750
Let's go.

813
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,151
Say, what's going on here?

814
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:10,603
Drive...

815
01:13:25,103 --> 01:13:28,325
Get that message to Gort... right away.

816
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:52,722
- Captain, hold these people back.
- Yes, sir.

817
01:13:52,837 --> 01:13:56,865
See if they have a stretcher
at the police station. Take him there.

818
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:35,943
Gort.

819
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:39,626
Klaatu barada nikto.

820
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:44,497
Klaatu barada nikto.

821
01:18:51,123 --> 01:18:54,729
Yes, sir. Yes, we have the body
here now, locked in a cell.

822
01:18:55,803 --> 01:18:59,025
There's no question about it, General.
He's dead all right.

823
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:02,708
I understand.
I'll be right there, sir.

824
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:05,546
Bring in a squad of men.
Place a guard around that cell.

825
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:08,884
- Captain, don't let anyone in or out of here.
- Yes, sir.

826
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,955
Come along.

827
01:21:07,722 --> 01:21:09,640
- Professor Barnhardt?
- Yes.

828
01:21:09,717 --> 01:21:12,939
I'm very sorry, but I have to ask you
to call off this meeting.

829
01:21:13,054 --> 01:21:15,509
Call it off?
But I had permission from the army.

830
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:21,033
I know, sir, but the robot's on the loose, and
it's not safe. You have to get your people out.

831
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,335
(electronic humming)

832
01:21:34,382 --> 01:21:36,339
(humming crescendos)

833
01:22:03,804 --> 01:22:06,183
(humming stops)

834
01:22:51,869 --> 01:22:53,902
Hello.

835
01:22:54,017 --> 01:22:55,590
I...

836
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:58,045
I thought you were...

837
01:22:58,122 --> 01:23:00,308
I was.

838
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:03,991
You mean...

839
01:23:04,758 --> 01:23:06,753
he has the power of life and death?

840
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:10,934
No. That power is reserved
to the Almighty Spirit.

841
01:23:11,011 --> 01:23:14,924
This technique, in some cases,
can restore life for a limited period.

842
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,995
But... how long?

843
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:19,373
You mean, how long will I live?

844
01:23:19,488 --> 01:23:21,675
That, no one can tell.

845
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:41,123
Under the circumstances,
the army people have asked us to leave.

846
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,151
And, since their concern is for our safety,

847
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:48,834
I can do nothing but
suggest that we comply.

848
01:24:21,248 --> 01:24:25,391
I am leaving soon,
and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly.

849
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,339
The universe grows smaller every day,

850
01:24:30,454 --> 01:24:35,287
and the threat of aggression by any group
anywhere can no longer be tolerated.

851
01:24:36,515 --> 01:24:40,888
There must be security for all,
or no one is secure.

852
01:24:41,732 --> 01:24:47,102
This does not mean giving up any freedom,
except the freedom to act irresponsibly.

853
01:24:48,637 --> 01:24:52,933
Your ancestors knew this when they
made laws to govern themselves,

854
01:24:53,048 --> 01:24:55,771
and hired policemen
to enforce them.

855
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:59,991
We of the other planets
have long accepted this principle.

856
01:25:00,068 --> 01:25:04,556
We have an organisation for
the mutual protection of all planets,

857
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:08,200
and for the complete
elimination of aggression.

858
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:14,299
The test of any such higher authority
is, of course, the police force that supports it.

859
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:18,174
For our policemen,
we created a race of robots.

860
01:25:19,209 --> 01:25:23,659
Their function is to patrol the planets
in spaceships like this one,

861
01:25:23,774 --> 01:25:25,922
and preserve the peace.

862
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:30,986
In matters of aggression we have
given them absolute power over us.

863
01:25:31,062 --> 01:25:33,671
This power cannot be revoked.

864
01:25:33,748 --> 01:25:39,080
At the first sign of violence,
they act automatically against the aggressor.

865
01:25:39,156 --> 01:25:43,683
The penalty for provoking their action
is too terrible to risk.

866
01:25:44,834 --> 01:25:47,480
The result is, we live in peace,

867
01:25:47,557 --> 01:25:49,552
without arms or armies,

868
01:25:49,629 --> 01:25:53,388
secure in the knowledge that
we are free from aggression and war,

869
01:25:53,465 --> 01:25:56,265
free to pursue more
profitable enterprises.

870
01:25:57,799 --> 01:26:01,060
We do not pretend
to have achieved perfection,

871
01:26:01,137 --> 01:26:04,551
but we do have a system,
and it works.

872
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:08,540
I came here to give
you these facts.

873
01:26:09,537 --> 01:26:13,297
It is no concern of ours
how you run your own planet.

874
01:26:13,412 --> 01:26:17,171
But if you threaten to
extend your violence,

875
01:26:17,286 --> 01:26:21,045
this Earth of yours will be
reduced to a burned-out cinder.

876
01:26:23,462 --> 01:26:25,879
Your choice is simple.

877
01:26:25,955 --> 01:26:28,679
Join us and live in peace,

878
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:32,131
or pursue your present course
and face obliteration.

879
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:36,888
We shall be waiting
for your answer.

880
01:26:37,003 --> 01:26:39,803
The decision rests with you.

881
01:26:59,482 --> 01:27:01,477
Gort! Baringa.

882
01:27:27,293 --> 01:27:29,096
(murmurs of confusion)

883
01:27:29,172 --> 01:27:31,167
(screaming)

884
01:28:01,168 --> 01:28:02,168
