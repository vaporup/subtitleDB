1
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,080
It's only movie making,
it's real fighting.

2
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
When we were training with Sammo,

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,040
sometimes he would bring
real fighters in to train us.

4
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,920
If you just fight, without caring,
it won't look good on the screen.

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
The audience can't see your power.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,320
So we have to tell people
that this is a movie.

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
So when you block,
he's got to stop.

8
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,920
Don't think because you're bigger
than me, you can blow me off screen

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
because then there's no one left
for you to fight.

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,520
You've got to work together.
It's just like dancing.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,720
Just like dancing -

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,440
two people together, but the
difference is there's power in it.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,720
You have to explain this to people
who are new to the business.

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,680
Some people are better suited than
others, just like Michelle Yeoh.

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,400
Some take longer. I was happy
to have trained quite a few.

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,960
When I watch them,
like Michelle Yeoh, Joyce Godenzi

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,000
and Christy Chung, who starred in
the first film I directed, I'm happy.

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,600
So, it's a speciality
of Hong Kong people

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
to make normal people
look like great fighters.

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,480
It's not just Hong Kong people
who can do it.

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,880
Foreigners often come here to shoot

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,800
and they look good
because of our techniques.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,160
It's the way we plan
and position the camera.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
If you're a good fighter,
we let you do ten or so moves.

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,800
If you're not, we give you two
then we change the angle.

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,040
Then we edit it, add sound effects
and it looks good.

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,760
I learned a lot when
I was training with Sammo's group.

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,920
Working with Sammo, we
acquired a lot of different skills.

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,640
The meaning of Sammo's stunt group -
his so-called "family group"...

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,920
Nowadays, they hire you
on a day-to-day basis

31
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
and you do your stunt work.

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,520
But Sammo's group
was like a real family.

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,360
When we were stuntmen,
we had to learn about props...

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,280
We learned about lighting,
we used to watch the gaffers

35
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,920
because inside the studio,
even when they were shooting drama,

36
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,680
we had to be on the set.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,040
And then we'd sleep -
we were only in our teens.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,760
And then later we understood
how to shoot the drama scenes

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,000
because there was only
so much sleeping we could do.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,920
We learned how Sammo did the drama
scenes, how he arranged the actors.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,640
We were there every day so we ended
up helping to organise the extras.

42
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,600
Sometimes the prop man would be busy
building an aeroplane chair

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,200
and we would help him build
these wood chairs.

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,960
Sometimes we would help
block out the light,

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,240
we didn't have computers then,
so we would hide the wires manually.

46
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,880
We learned many skills
that stuntmen don't need to know.

47
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,440
We thought it was
a waste of time then,

48
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,080
but now I see it was well worth it.

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
I directed two movies myself.

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040
I didn't have to rely on
anyone telling me

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,440
to do things this way or that way.

52
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
I'd learned this from Sammo.

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,040
What I was willing to learn then
has now proved useful.

54
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,800
Now it's,
"Ah, I know how to do this,"

55
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,320
as I have acquired the experience,
which is a good thing.

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,600
I feel there's a karma between us.

57
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,840
I don't think I will ever meet
someone who is so...

58
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,240
I can't explain.

59
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,480
Although he was my boss,
he was also my teacher.

60
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,400
He was a very good teacher.

61
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,880
I remember when
I was in primary school in Lam Wan,

62
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,400
I swam to a float...

63
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,760
The first time I met him,
before my career had started,

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,200
he also swam to the float
with a friend,

65
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,800
"Sammo Hung! The action movie star!"

66
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
In the 10 years I've been under him,

67
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,160
I think we spoke
on less than 100 occasions.

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,240
What I mean is...

69
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
- "Is that OK?"
- "Yes!"

70
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,320
That was it.
There was very little conversation.

71
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,760
It was strange.
It was like telepathy.

72
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
The most we spoke was

73
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,560
the occasion when we were
in the studio shooting a movie

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,760
and Sammo told me
to go up to his office.

75
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,200
It was in Golden Harvest
and it was on the third floor.

76
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
I was scared, I've never been called
to his office before.

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,280
I was afraid
but I really respected Sammo

78
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,080
I got there and knocked on the door.
I couldn't look. "Sammo?"

79
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,280
He said, "You're here."

80
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,560
I couldn't speak and Sammo said,

81
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,280
"I've got a vampire movie
and you can star in it so get ready."

82
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,560
I was surprised!

83
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,440
I just went...
I didn't even thank him.

84
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,440
"Go on, back to work."

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,360
That's the most Sammo
ever said to me.

86
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,400
Our relationship,
we communicated with our eyes.

87
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Which was good.
I feel Sammo cared for me.

88
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,400
He was quite powerful.

89
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,960
He was fearsome when he was angry.

90
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,840
If you were late or
couldn't do an action piece,

91
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,080
he shouted at you and
everyone on set would be quiet.

92
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,720
Thankfully, in all the 10 years I was
with him he never told me off once.

93
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,240
There was one time
when a martial arts expert was late.

94
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,600
He shouted at him until he left.

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,560
I was on a morning shift,
seven o'clock start,

96
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,080
I was young and went out a lot
and couldn't get up,

97
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,200
I got to the set just before noon.

98
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,240
When I arrived,
he came over to me...

99
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,200
I saw the other fighters and
got the feeling I was in big trouble.

100
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,960
He came over and said,
"Don't be so late next time".

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,680
He used this casual manner in which
to speak to me.

102
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,960
I was so scared.
So, I feel that he cares for me.

103
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,560
Because of our relationship,
I'd risk anything for him.

104
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,280
I'd do falls,
get hit by a car, get burnt...

105
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,640
Even after I'd been injured,
I'd still go and help him out.

106
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,920
It wasn't a business relationship.

107
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,360
He never said, "Kar-Iok,
jump down from the second floor!"

108
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,440
"OK, how much?"
It was never like that.

109
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,680
Sometimes we did get paid
and sometimes we didn't.

110
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,200
That's because
we had a good relationship.

111
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,080
So, when he said, "Kar-Iok, you're
going to star in my next movie,"

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
I was very happy.

113
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,960
I really enjoy working for Sammo,
he didn't have to do that.

114
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,600
It wasn't like, "I've done
you a favour, now you do me one."

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,520
I followed him for ten years.

116
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,440
If you can endure it for ten years,

117
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,360
after four or five years,
you should make it.

118
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,600
I was quite happy
with The Scorpion King.

119
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,120
It was an action film
with a lot of dialogue -

120
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,640
I had never done one before.

121
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,320
As I remember, this was my third film
where I was the lead.

122
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,760
For me...

123
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
The director may have really wanted
to make a kung fu thriller

124
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,720
but for me, it was a chance
to expand my speech.

125
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,880
At the time, I was happy
but there was a trade off.

126
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,800
The more dialogue I had,
the less action I was given.

127
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,720
Maybe he did want a dialogue based
kung fu film after all.

128
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,840
So, I did not feel disappointed

129
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,840
as I felt I'd have the chance to do
an action film I liked.

130
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,640
Back then, there was a lot
of this type of collaboration.

131
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,520
Yuen Tak was the fight coordinator
and Yuen Kwai the action director.

132
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,120
Lau Kar-leung was
a famous action director.

133
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Why did we choose him
to play the part of my master?

134
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,320
We hoped to have Lau Kar-leung's
renowned kung fu in it.

135
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,400
This was the best thing about
making films in Hong Kong back then.

136
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,560
We could put
many people's ideas together.

137
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
Even I put my own ideas into
the design of the action sequences.

138
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
For instance...

139
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Yuen Tak and Yuen Kwai
would ask Lau Kar-leung

140
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,480
what part of the Scorpion style
looks good.

141
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,400
Master Lau would then do it

142
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,320
and Yuen Kwai would choose
the parts he liked

143
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,080
and use this for the film.

144
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,080
This was how the action sequences
were created.

145
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,520
A lot of Sammo Hung's films
are like this.

146
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,840
If you look back,
you'd see some bits of Yuen Woo-ping

147
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,480
or Yuen Kwai, Mang Hoi...

148
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,080
All the action directors...
Yuen Biao, Lam Ching-ying...

149
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,600
All of them...
Sammo Hung's troupe was like this.

150
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,600
We all came together
to create something.

151
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,720
Which was the best way.
We worked as a team to do something.

152
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
I was very happy to work with him.
I have never...

153
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,760
Lai Tai-wai showed me a tape of him.

154
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,600
He said that this Korean actor
was to star in a film with me.

155
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,440
I watched it. It was quite vicious.

156
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,480
In all my years of action films,
I had never seen one like this.

157
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,200
But when I filmed with him,
there were no problems.

158
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,200
He started his career in films, too.

159
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,040
He was experienced in kung fu
and stunts...

160
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,120
I also started out with martial arts.

161
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,640
We martial arts experts...
We call it a lesser role.

162
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,360
We react to the first move.

163
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,840
Martial artists
are used to following the first move.

164
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,880
We fight best this way,

165
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,240
so we coordinated well together.

166
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,520
Yuen Jeung had a good attitude.

167
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,280
Some people just fight for themselves
and don't care about others

168
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,720
but his attitude was good
as he helped others... like me.

169
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,320
For example, his movement was large
and mine was small and sharp

170
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,600
and I'd have to wait for him.

171
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,720
So, I'd add another movement
so our timing was right again.

172
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,800
A good attitude
makes everyone feel good.

173
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,760
He was a good match.

174
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,840
In a recent film I made,

175
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,040
I specifically had him
be in it to help me.

176
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,160
Yuen Jeung is
a very good action star.
