It's because your actions are immature

367
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,061
You're sinful

368
00:25:51,476 --> 00:25:55,845
KIRA, you are cruel than other criminals

369
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,212
You are also immature

370
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:03,113
Let the world see it, L

371
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:08,957
However, I know many
people are supporting KIRA

372
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:14,761
It is because KIRA punished those
criminals who haven't get the punishment

373
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,291
I am enjoy fighting with you, L

374
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:26,270
However, if we agree with your actions

375
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,643
then the civilization societies

376
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:34,415
will become the barbarian societies

377
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:37,947
40 seconds

378
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:41,451
L, are you ok?

379
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:43,389
Anything happened?

380
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:46,123
Bring him away, hurry up

381
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:55,931
What is happening?
It's so scary

382
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:00,105
Stop the broadcast

383
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:02,135
Call the ambulance

384
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:17,755
It is shocking me, I merely guess

385
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:24,699
KIRA, you are able to kill
people by not using your hand?

386
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:29,302
You listen, KIRA

387
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:35,773
The person you've killed just now,
is a death penalty prisoner

388
00:27:35,813 --> 00:27:42,981
He had never be reported in the media.
He was arrested secretly by police

389
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,151
Through the law negotiation,
let him replace me

390
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:50,555
I'm still alive

391
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:57,865
Come on, come and kill me

392
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:08,476
It seems you cannot kill people at sometimes

393
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:14,584
Furthermore, I've got a
very important information

394
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:20,957
You are in the area of Kanto, Japan now

395
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:26,428
Although we claimed this is
live broadcast in the world

396
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:31,458
Actually it only broadcasts
in the areas of Kanto, Japan

397
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:36,166
It's because the first victim was
the criminal who was reported in Japan

398
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,835
So I focus you in Japan

399
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:43,371
Now the investigation's scope is smaller

400
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:44,346
Nice Out

401
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:49,080
This is not a game,
please watch yourself

402
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,212
I'm sorry

403
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:57,460
The investigation's scope is smaller

404
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:03,228
KIRA I'll arrest you and solve the puzzles

405
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:09,863
Then I'll send you to death penalty

406
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,279
Send me to death penalty...

407
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:19,512
I represent righteous

408
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,510
Righteous? I am the only
one who represents righteous

409
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:28,150
Save the threaten human beings,
I'm the God in the new world

410
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,288
Those who against this God are sinful

411
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:36,560
Both insist on righteous
are fighting one another

412
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,626
Human beings are interesting

413
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:46,065
Let me be the witness in this battle

414
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,202
I knew it

415
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:51,645

He uses this reasoning to
find out KIRA, L is amazing

418
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:08,695
Can we sacrifice the death penalty
prisoner for the purpose of investigation?

419
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:13,568
If we do so, we have no different with KIRA

Sayu, what is your opinion to KIRA?

436
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:48,171
I think it's not so proper
since the police are here

I've never thought somebody may get killed
through the live broadcast

This is not proper

446
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:19,025
Light, you're really agree with KIRA

447
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:21,371
If compared with L

448
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,671
KIRA is a killer

449
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:27,540
This is different with Light's virtuous

450
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:30,046
Indeed, KIRA scares the criminals

451
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:34,575
He merely uses the terror to treat us

452
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,313
It's called 'revolution'

453
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:42,252
Normally some people
will betray to the revolution

454
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:44,761

455
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:46,922

456
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,002
Ah, no.
Excuse me, we've better go out

458
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:22,894
Ok

00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:32,969
Sorry, in the public...

Unless the situation is critical,
if not I can't make it

If she knows you're KIRA,
what would she think?

462
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:51,425

463
00:32:57,701 --> 00:33:02,195

According to L's instruction

466
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:12,376
This chart is drawn according
to the time of death victims

470
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:30,223
The prinzip of Naturality which was
invented by Bernoulli in year 1718

471
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,634
[ One of the data appears many times ]
Can L see that?

472
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:36,139
I think it links with L's computer

473
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:40,735
[ Use the prinzip of average

[ Uses these data and
restructure according to 7 days ]

Is L controlling?

476
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:49,709
Em, it may be

477
00:33:58,295 --> 00:33:59,785
What is this?

478
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:03,760
It seems I've seen this shape before

479
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,826
Ah, it's timetable

480
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:11,464

481

fifth section on Monday got class

484
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,415

Brother and Shiori

493
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,744
What are you talking about?

494
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:51,407
What are you talking about Light?

495
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,245
Come, today you're tired

496
00:34:55,286 --> 00:35:00,223
It has been a long time I don't eat at home

497
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:03,324
You really look exhausted?

498
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:05,652
Why you mentioned really?

499
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:10,133
Dad, are you responsible for KIRA's case?

500
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,059
Why you think like that?

501
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:15,868
If it is not a heavy case,
then Dad won't be so stressed

502
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,636
I would like to help dad

503
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:27,107
Light, your reasoning really help us
to solve many cases all the way

504
00:35:28,452 --> 00:35:30,579
You're really smart

505
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:33,953
I feel honour to you

506
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:36,888
I feel honour to you too

507
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:38,157
Really?

508
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,359
However, my opponent

509
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:46,058
is a devil killer-KIRA

510
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:53,774
who can kill many persons
without using his hand

511
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,010
I cannot involve you

512
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:01,649
However, if you hand over to me...

513
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:02,379
Cannot

514
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:07,218
This is my case

515
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:15,861
You should solve the cases
in 5 or 10 years later

516
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:20,097
Now you should prepare for that moment

517
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,930
Be patient

518
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:26,808
I understood, dad

519
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:29,943
So I go to study now

520
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:32,139
For 10 years later

521
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,117
Dad

522
00:36:38,122 --> 00:36:40,784
However if anything happens to dad

523
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:45,727
At that time, I will send KIRA for execution

524
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:09,511
You've never thought about your dad
is the responsible person for KIRA's case

525
00:37:09,553 --> 00:37:12,613
This is the daily report
in the police office

526
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:14,214
I am reading today's content

527
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:17,284
They know KIRA is a student

528
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,737
24 criminals die in a day?

529
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:33,672
Furthermore, one person for every hour

530
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,473
What happened actually?

531
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:39,175
The information about KIRA is
a student is not trusted anymore

532
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,708
This is not KIRA wanted to tell

533
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,685
What do you mean?

534
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,589
KIRA wants to imply he has the power
to control the time of death freely

535
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:52,026
Time of death? Freely control?

536
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,654
Wei, Ryuk

537
00:37:55,732 --> 00:38:00,795
The afternoon after the
revolution is so peaceful

538
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,604
The rate of criminals has decreased

539
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:07,132
That's because of KIRA

540
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:12,977
The world becomes peaceful
and no more criminals

541
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,150
Who will expect this day is coming

542
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,524
What happened to you, Ryuk?

543
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:28,793
You don't want to eat today?

544
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,229
Don't worry, nobody will see it here

545
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:54,086
There is somebody following me, since when?

546
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,785
The morning before yesterday

547
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:57,794
Why you never tell me?

548
00:38:57,828 --> 00:39:01,320
I am not at your side, so do L

549
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:05,992
I think he's police officer

550
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:09,437
No, police officer won't do so

551
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:35,230
Light, our shinigami are depend
on the human life span to live

552
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:37,164
What do you mean?

553
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,862
The names written in the death note

554
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:42,667
will die before the end of their life span

555
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:47,006
Shinigami will get the unused life span

556
00:39:48,712 --> 00:39:54,446
So what do you think how
we get to know their names

557
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,747
You can see it

558
00:39:59,423 --> 00:40:00,822
You're right

559
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:07,521
As long as we see the face,
name and life span will...

560
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:13,092
So you see my life span
and can see that guy's name

561
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:18,938
Don't you want it?
This pair of God of Death's eyes

562
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:24,041
I see, so what is the price?

563
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,113
Half of your remain life span

564
00:40:31,188 --> 00:40:32,314
No talking

565
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:36,218
So how you get to know his name?

566
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,369
Sir, there's third victim in the prison

567
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:53,467
The criminal names Bai
hurt his finger inside the prison

568
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,070
wrote down a strange star's symbol
on the wall

569
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:58,377
left a letter by using a false name

570
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,143
and...

571
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:05,980
ran out from the prison,
30 meters away from the toilet

572
00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:08,821
and died of heart paralyse

573
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,455
Mr. Yagami

574
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:16,299
About the victim this time

575
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:20,497
Please don't announce the information
other than he has died of heart paralyse

576
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:21,333
Reason?

577
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,302
KIRA might use the criminal
for his experiments

578
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:36,651
According to the water Department,
the tank is on the building

579
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:39,815
and the pipe is under ground

580
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,451
See, even though they do not announce

581
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:49,955
but the condition at the time of
victims death are recorded very clearly

582
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,960
It's unexpected that all the things happened
according to the written in the Death Note

583
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,404
It's amazing

584
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,571
[ Runaway after killing 3 banking officers ]
Today about 2:40pm

585
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:02,009
In a bank in Kanagawa

586
00:42:02,713 --> 00:42:05,477
3 men with weapons stormed inside

587
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:11,010
Killed 3 banking officers,
robbed away 2.5 million

588
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:14,156
Police arrested 2 criminals

589
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:18,388
At the moment, police are in the
effort of arresting the runway criminal

590
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:21,795
The runaway suspect named Ozuki,
36 years old

591
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:24,494
have record of killing and drug possession

592
00:42:24,534 --> 00:42:25,023
Ryuk

593
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:32,740
Will the people who touch
the death note can see you?

594
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:33,800
Yes, why?

595
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:37,542
Suddenly criminal Ozuki
shoots the bank staff

596
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:44,316
The situation becomes chaotic,
Janton and the other suspects...

597
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:17,046
The bus starts moving,
please watch your safety

598
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:32,826
It has been a long time
I haven't taken a bus

599
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:39,172
Actually since three days before,
somebody is following me

600
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:45,177
Why are you following me?

601
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:52,622
Are you a detective?
Who instructed you to do so?

602
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,987
I don't know what you mean

603
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,616
If you don't want to die
then follow my instructions

604
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:29,955
Don't move, sit well

605
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:32,953
Light

606
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:43,566
Contact your company

607
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:50,305
This is number 124 Joben... JoJoben

608
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:53,242
I'm hijacking a bus

609
00:44:53,283 --> 00:45:01,816
If you don't want me to kill the
hostages then prepare a hundred million yen

610
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:05,220
I'll try to control him

611
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:11,926
Don't

612
00:45:12,702 --> 00:45:14,294
It's dangerous

613
00:45:15,205 --> 00:45:17,366
If it's critical, I'll do it

614
00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:19,875
What's your background?
Are you trustworthy?

615
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,901
I am police's son

616
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,514
Release your hand

617
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:29,040
Wait

I'll save all of you

619
00:45:33,256 --> 00:45:38,421
The people who is following other people,
how he's going to prove that he's innocent?

620
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:39,359
Partner?

621
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:42,124
You're purposely let other
think there is only one criminal

622
00:45:42,165 --> 00:45:43,626
Actually you're afraid somebody
is watching from behind.

623
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:45,129
There has such case happened before

624
00:45:51,174 --> 00:45:51,663
Good

625
00:45:57,681 --> 00:45:58,170
FBI?

626
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:00,708
Name, name

627
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,113
Raye Penber

628
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:14,391
Wei, what are you doing?

629
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:24,496
Wei, you are so daring

630
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:32,104
What... what is that, the thing behind

631
00:46:34,718 --> 00:46:36,447
Can you see me?

632
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,354
Don't kidding, since when you're there?

633
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:47,087
I see, that's paper from the Death Note

634
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:47,687
Bastard

635
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:50,529
Lean on the floor quickly

636
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,276
Excuse me,
I am Death God so you can't kill me

637
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:14,046
Stop, quickly stop

638
00:47:15,158 --> 00:47:15,556
Yes

639
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:42,312
Ozuki, die in accident 29th March 2006

640
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:50,189
At 10:12am
drive towards Okugawa bus station

641
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:52,490
The Nanjing bus which drives to Okugawa

642
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:56,090
Taking a gun which has 8 bullets

643
00:47:56,132 --> 00:48:00,262
Try to rob the profits of Nanjing Bus

644
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:04,368
but see the hallucination

645
00:48:05,442 --> 00:48:06,841
and shoot it

646
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:08,711
[ Chest, pain ]

647
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:10,212
As the bullets has finished
so he gets down of the bus in fear

648
00:48:10,246 --> 00:48:12,180
It will be ok

649
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:14,448
Wait

650
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:19,921
If you have anything to ask,
you may find me died in an car accident

651
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:22,584
I won't hide or runaway

652
00:48:44,013 --> 00:48:45,275
You're back

653
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:46,304
I'm back

654
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:53,689
What happened?

655
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,156
Any problems?

656
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:56,953
No, nothing

657
00:49:07,937 --> 00:49:10,838
When will we visit priest?

658
00:49:12,142 --> 00:49:15,043
Saturday, can you make it?

659
00:49:16,846 --> 00:49:17,335
Raye

660
00:49:18,148 --> 00:49:20,116
Your opponent is KIRA

661
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,380
Don't force yourself

662
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:26,517
As long as there is instruction from L,
the people who don't care about their safety

663
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:27,215
is you

664
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:31,524
It's because you are here

665
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:39,098
These are the latest
letters left by the victims

666
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:47,836
L, do you know

667
00:49:53,816 --> 00:49:55,147
Shinigami

668
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:00,184
Only eat...

669
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:01,815
Only eats apples

670
00:50:03,726 --> 00:50:07,890
It's impossible FBI only send a agent
to carry the investigation

671
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:11,799
L thinks that KIRA exists
in the surrounding of the police officers

672
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:17,101
so he privately instructs FBI
to investigate the relevant police officers
