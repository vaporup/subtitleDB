He was arrested of being
suspected in many raping cases

33

However, due to the fear of the victims

34
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:19,896
and there were not enough
evidence so he's not prosecuted

35

At the time when KIRA kills people

147
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:20,081
at least he needs to
know their names and face

148
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:24,177

don't use your real name

151
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,823
One more point

152
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:41,467
I think KIRA is able to control the
behavior of the victims before they die

153
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:44,098
The prisoners who left their letters

154
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,801
and people who had weird actions

155
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:48,208
I think that were caused
by experiments from KIRA

156
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:49,302
Experiments?

157
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,609
I think he has the purpose
to kill the FBI agents

158
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:55,913
and he wants to know their
control power before they die

159
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:59,479
In the same time, he passes me messages
through the letters from the criminals

160
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,820
In other words,
they're controlled by KIRA also

161
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:05,988
There were 8 days in between the experiments
in prisons to the death of FBI agents

162
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:09,828
I'm afraid he met with one of the FBI agents

163
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:13,996
controlled that agent and got
all the agents' information

164
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:16,163
KIRA is able to find
out the investigations of

165
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,469
FBI and he is able to
do experiments in prisons

166
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,843
It means he is the relevant
person in among the police officers

167
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,640
It's because of that

168
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:27,115
So the suspected criminals have decreased

169
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:31,248

170
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:36,953

00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:11,984
It's really trouble all of you

186
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:16,958
[ ln front of Saitama,
rotary, CCTV recording ]

187
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:48,251
This person

188
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:52,792
Ah, he is the person who sat behind

189
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:53,954
I remember

190
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,588
I think he quarreled
with a young man in front

191
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,692
After that,
the criminal got into the bus

192
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:02,602
So how did the young man look like?

193
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,196
He is a good guy

194
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,798
I'm not saying outlook appearance

195
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,308
I should say he is daring

196
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:09,402
Even though he was pointed
by the gun of the criminal

197
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,675
but he remained calm

198
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:14,716
Was he being interrogated by the police?

199
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,242
He disappeared in that commotion

200
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,819
You focus the criminals already, aren't you?

201
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:24,251
Yes

202
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:26,043
Who?

203
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,767
The family members of the
head and assistant head

204
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,833
Can you tell me the reason?

205
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:55,082
He is a FBI agent.
As everybody sees, when he was killed

206
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,711
he pointed at the train

207
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,890
Are you saying there was somebody inside?

208
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:05,826
And the person inside might be KIRA

209
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:13,726
How about her?

210
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,963
She is Raye's fiancee

211
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,604
Originally she is a talented FBI agent

212
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:23,339
She worked for me before

213
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:28,508
May be she felt Raye had
something wrong so she followed him

214
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:30,815
Then unfortunately she saw his death

215
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:33,913
So shall we get her contact now

216
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:37,414
She is missing after Raye's death

217
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,726
So I guess KIRA might
be investigated by Raye

218
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:44,562
It means the family
members of Kazuku and mine

219
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:44,998
Yes

220
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:46,790
1% to 3%

221
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:50,262
Don't you want to interrogate us?

222
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:50,601
No

223
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,669
Please allow me to install spy cam in
Mr. Yagami's and Mr. Kazuku's house

224
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,837
Install the spy cam

225
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:02,875
Don't you think we'll allow
you to use such tactic in Japan?

226
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:05,079
If somebody discover it, we will be fired

227
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,649
This is not about position,
it's about human lives

228
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:15,791
Ok, do according what he said

229
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:16,229
Sir

230
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:20,595
but since you want to do it
so please investigate properly

231
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:23,400
But sir, your wife and
Sayu are inside the house

232
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,270
Of course I know

233
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:30,073
If there is a mistake, I'll be suspected

234
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:33,815
It is no use to guard the house forever

235
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:37,512
The installation will only carry 7 days

236
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:42,957
At least we cannot let
our head to guard his house

237
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,721
It is truth, so

238
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:49,958
Mr. Yagami's house will be
guarded by Mr. Yagami and me

239
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:55,596
Other people will guard
Mr. Kazuku's family members

240
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,750
This person

241
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:17,221
Do you remember?

242
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:22,285
He was the person who followed Light

243
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:24,663
What happened to him?

244
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:28,132
He is dead

245
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,607
In the process of investigating KIRA

246
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:37,043
he was killed by KIRA

247
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,109
Wei, Light

248
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:47,352
Why do you plan
the death actions for few weeks?

249
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:51,155
If one day I am hospitalized or cannot move

250
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:55,357
If suddenly there is no death person,
it's easily to get suspected

251
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:57,331
You're so careful

252
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,163

00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,070
Now, let's announce the first menu

256
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:07,837
That's

257
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:11,174
can let enemies put on weight

258
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:14,239
called croissant and pudding

259
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,146
What happened?

260
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:22,820
Nothing

261
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,522
Can let enemy put on 5 kgs

262
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:36,070
Misa Misa's enemy

263
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,033
Still is Tazuka

264
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:43,475
So Misa Misa would like to make her fat

265
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,041
This is considered as a little devil

266
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,246
Croissant and pudding are ready

267
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:54,551
Let's all the enemies put on weight

268
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,421
Misa is so great

269
00:24:56,892 --> 00:25:00,589
So who's the person Misa respects?

270
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:02,386
KIRA

271
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:06,358
Ah, Misa Misa is the devotee of KIRA

272
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:10,771
Did you think he is trendy, silent executor

273
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:14,537
All the youngsters say so recently

274
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,307
Furthermore, KIRA is my benefactor

275
00:25:19,615 --> 00:25:20,673
What happened?

276
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:24,482
Misa, I've told you not to tell about KIRA

277
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,350
Ai, but

278
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:31,091
Advertising company is very
troublesome, please cut the part just now

279
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,060
No freedom at all

280
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:38,293
It means we are not allowed
to ask private stuffs?

281
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,996
No, it's only this case is not so convenient

282
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:45,973
KIRA's stuffs are the hot topic now

283
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,840
It's trouble you all

284
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:51,542
It's trouble you all

285
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:11,657
Light

286
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:25,879
Light, this is Miss Shioko

287
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,484
She wants to meet you,
she has something to ask you

288
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:33,450
This is the first time we meet

289
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:35,320
Nice to meet you

290
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:38,255
I want to do a cover on KIRA

291
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:42,024
Light, you met Raye before, right?

292
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:48,792
He is the FBI
we met in the bus being hijacked

293
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:49,132
Ah

294
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:53,107
In the process of investigating KIRA

295
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:55,542
He was killed by KIRA

296
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:57,475
How would it be?

297
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:59,006
Don't you know it?

298
00:26:59,047 --> 00:26:59,445
But

299
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,077
he followed Light before

300
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:08,248
Yes, so he suspected you're KIRA

301
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,327
So he was killed by me

302
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:14,829
This is what you wanted to say

303
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,730
As long as KIRA knows the name
then he can kill

304
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:21,827
So you use the bus hijacked case
to find out Raye's name

305
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,361
Ha ha, a strange lady

306
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:28,741
However, Raye did not die after meeting me

307
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:30,540
It was three days after meeting you

308
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,979
Sorry if I offend you

309
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:38,149
If I were KIRA,
I'd killed him after knowing his name

310
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:40,781
How would Light be KIRA

311
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:41,888
You

312
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,583
There is a limit of offend

313
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:50,826
I would have sue you
so I must record what you have said

314
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,797
This is because there were
other FBI agents besides Raye

315
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:56,896
If you kill Raye immediately
then you would be suspected

316
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:59,100
so you must kill all the FBI agents

317
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:02,508
So you didn't kill Raye on the spot

318
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,841
Am I right?

319
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:07,008
All the agents has died?

320
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,517
Why there is no such news?

321
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:11,712
As this is a confidential task

00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,516
[ Shioko, remember she has something to do,
rush towards Kinoshita ]

These are created by you

324
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:20,025
Sorry, Light isn't this type of person

325
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:22,087
Then in the subway

326
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:26,428
You use your tactic to get
other FBI agents' name from Raye

327
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:27,935
killed all of them

328
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,030
[ Shioko, remembers she has something to do,

00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:34,133

00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,010

Light Yagami

332
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:47,384
It's no use if you want to kill me

333
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:51,017
because I gave you the fake name

334
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,619
Don't be too much

335
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,555
Raye is my fiancee

336
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:03,093
I'll find out the murderer of Raye

337
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:06,040
I'll let him receive the punishment

338
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:10,241
I think she is crazy

339
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:14,372
Fake name

340
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:26,493
Somebody troubles you again

341
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:33,724
Shinigami's eyes, you really don't want?

342
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:40,174
Ha ha, even the powerful Light
also don't know what to do

343
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:11,768
According the report from the installer

344
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,100
Light go check whether there are
other people entering his bills

345
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:22,105
He checked whether somebody
has entered his room

346
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,517
Only install many cameras in Light's room?

347
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:31,720
It's because I look through his
character, IQ, habitual life and summary

348
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,923
Light is the person who is
close to the KIRA's image

349
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:38,729
Even if guarding like
this, we're wasting time

350
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,735
Even if it has 1% of possibility

351
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:44,830
We'll investigate any suspicious thing

352
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:49,134
If not we're difficult to catch KIRA

353
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:57,900
Wei, Light, please bother me

354
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,425

359
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,824

The condition of my room is
different from this morning

Somebody entered my room

363
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:46,712
I think this room has installed cameras

364
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:54,818
Light, are you looking down on L?

365
00:31:55,826 --> 00:32:02,527
If we're being guarded
then I cannot eat apple inside the room

366
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:10,530
I've to check the cameras position
and find out the dead angle

367
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,071
He studies in the room most of the time

368
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:48,510
You must feel honour to have such a son

369
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:53,009
His ambition is to be a policeman

370
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:58,247
How to make Light not suspicious?

371
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:01,584
There are no suspicious movements
made during the observation

372
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,490
and KIRA can kill people at this time

373
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,654
He is innocent then

374
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:09,394
Are you waiting KIRA to kill people?

375
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:11,059
You may say so

376
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,183
The third day

377
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:34,914
Brother, have your meal

378
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:49,729
I go to smoke

379
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,217
Chief, please take a rest

380
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:10,484
You don't have good
sleep for these three days

381
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:15,726
Family is being suspected,
how can I sleep well

382
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:37,075
Three hunted killers were killed

383
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:41,448
Two killers died in the jail

384
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:43,254
The news is confirmed

385
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:44,590
Is it true?

386
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:49,388
It's too early to be happy

387
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,802
Don't you forget KIRA can
control the time of death?

388
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:59,642
When a new criminal is reported

389
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,301
then only we can know the truth

390
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:17,916
The fifth day

391
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,767
The seventh day

392
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:06,464
Mom, don't you worry?

393
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,044
Dad hasn't came back for a week

394
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:11,070
Mom has use to it

395
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,749
Dad is working hard now

396
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:14,841
Sayu must be hardworking too

397
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:15,373
Good

398
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:22,752
Ai, brother eats potato chips after dinner?
You will gain weight

399
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:26,956
It's ok, I'll burn midnight oil tonight

400
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:27,928
I'm full

401
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:34,262
He's so fearfulness

402
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:06,033
45 US dollar and one million eight
thousand US dollar, ending the agreement

403
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:10,836
The petroleum price has
dropped to 60 dollar US

404
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:17,074
The high purchasing is the
main reason of rise this time

405
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:19,205
Next news

406
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:26,052
[ Edogawa, a child was
kidnapped, suspect is arrested! ]

407
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:30,287
The criminal who is involved
in kidnapping 5 years old girl is arrested

408
00:37:30,326 --> 00:37:32,590
The arrested person is Kisha, 29 years old

409
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:35,063
[ Kisha (29 years old)

410
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:40,226
Police found Melisa body in his apartment

411
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:47,904
Last month 28th, other children
saw Melisa near to that area

412
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:53,041
Melisa was inside
a red colour car and missing

413
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,815
After that, Melisa's family
got the money request from the criminal

414
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,584
He doesn't read the news

415
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:05,126
We didn't report this news
as we are respecting the hostage's life

416
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:09,928
The arrested criminals is sent
to the Boat Moat police station now

417
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:11,524
He is facing the media
and doing something weird

418
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:12,466
[ Why? ]

419
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,005
The fact after the trial...

420
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:33,555
It seems there has something happened

421
00:38:33,923 --> 00:38:34,947
Mr. Daisu

422
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:40,419
Here is Boat Moat,
the suspect Kisha has died

423
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:47,203
On the way of sending Kisha
to police station

424
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:54,302
Kisha was in pain suddenly,
it seemed he was having heart paralyse

425
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:55,368
Mr. Daisu

426
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:57,010
Yes

427
00:38:57,046 --> 00:39:00,072
This is indeed done by KIRA

428
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,712
Although the cause of death
hasn't be identified

429
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:07,314
but it's most possible done by KIRA

430
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:08,016
There is a new criminal killed by KIRA again

431
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:09,422
Now the police station is in alarm

432
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:12,758
Light is not suspected anymore

433
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:15,092
Ryuzaki, it is enough

434
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:17,327
We'll updating the news from time to time

435
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:18,061
Ryuzaki

436
00:39:55,138 --> 00:40:00,098
The family of Chief and Kazuku
are not suspected anymore

437
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:03,874
Ryuzaki, you're still not satisfied?

438
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:11,645
Watari, take back all the spy cameras

439
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,148
I know it

440
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,427
It's great, Sir Yagami

441
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:24,058
However, we need to start
a new investigation again

442
00:40:39,015 --> 00:40:40,983
Light, all the spy cameras were taken out

443
00:40:41,017 --> 00:40:41,415
All

444
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:09,674
It's great to eat apple when nobody sees it

445
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,374
But Light

446
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:21,246
If your sister eats that snack, how?

447
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:30,732
Original potato chips, only I'll
eat it among my family members

448
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,847
Call from Naomi Misora

449
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,750
Long time no see

450
00:41:54,924 --> 00:42:01,056
After this I'll prove to
you that Light Yagami is KIRA

451
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:03,028
Use my life

452
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:15,335
[ Shiori ]

453
00:42:19,348 --> 00:42:20,280
Wei, wei

454
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,445
Can I meet you now?

455
00:42:23,853 --> 00:42:24,547
Where?

456
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:25,882
Art gallery

457
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:28,423
I want to see you also

458
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:33,553
How long will you take to arrive here?

459
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,029
I can go now

460
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:38,096
After 30 minutes

461
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:39,492
Light

462
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:43,831
It's weird, Shiori?

463
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:50,306
Shiori

464
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:07,321
CCTV in the art gallery

465
00:43:08,231 --> 00:43:10,061
- Show it
- Yes

466
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:24,808
I am at the entrance

467
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:25,677
Come in

468
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:29,279
Now, I'm at the front of the
drawing by Ekusuhso Kenak's

469
00:43:30,787 --> 00:43:31,776
I got it

470
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:39,555
You know how KIRA kills people?

471
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:41,995
Ryuzaki, what happened?

472
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:52,599
Light

473
00:43:54,811 --> 00:43:57,803
KIRA indeed is Light Yagami

474
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:04,516
You are still suspecting Light

475
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,427
Shiori

476
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:19,726
Light

477
00:44:21,237 --> 00:44:22,329
I'm sorry

478
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,570
Light Yagami

479
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:32,538
If you don't want her to be killed
then ask for forgiveness now

480
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:35,779
Ask for forgiveness from Raye

481
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,285
and admit you're KIRA

482
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:42,951
Contact the local police

483
00:44:42,992 --> 00:44:43,390
Yes

484
00:44:47,196 --> 00:44:49,027
You misunderstood

485
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,123
I am not KIRA

486
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,497
If you don't tell the truth

487
00:44:55,304 --> 00:44:56,362
I'll kill her

488
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:56,700
No

489
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,599
Even if I am KIRA

490
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,972
It has nothing to do with Shiori

491
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:04,571
If you want to kill then kill me

492
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:09,278
I want you to know the pain
of losing the beloved person

493
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:10,615
Don't, stop

494
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,989
As long as you don't hurt Shiori

495
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:14,614
Light

496
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:18,960
It is so shameful

497
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:23,687
You as KIRA but can't even kill me

498
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:26,201
Only can cry and beg me

499
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:29,295
That's why I say I am not KIRA

500
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:34,241
You can't kill if you don't get their names

501
00:45:36,946 --> 00:45:40,473
So let me tell you my real name

502
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,281
Naomi Misora

503
00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:46,751
Naomi Misora, N for north

504
00:45:47,857 --> 00:45:48,949
M for man

505
00:45:51,861 --> 00:45:55,262
Good, since you've got my name

506
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:58,160
so kill me

507
00:46:05,574 --> 00:46:06,905
Naomi Misora

508
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,742
What happen to the local police

509
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:13,248
They'll arrive soon

510
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:13,976
Cannot

511
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,948
Let them go later

512
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:17,543
What are you talking about?

513
00:46:17,586 --> 00:46:19,053
The following is the wonderful part

514
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:21,249
What are you talking about?

515
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,315
This is not acting

516
00:46:23,993 --> 00:46:26,655
Do you want to save your girl friend?

517
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:28,561
Then just kill me

518
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:32,398
Like how you killed Raye

519
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:35,996
Like how you killed other criminals

520
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:38,768
No need to use your hand

521
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,540
Just kill me

522
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:43,539
I've said I am not KIRA

523
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:38,627
Shiori

524
00:47:39,035 --> 00:47:39,729

525
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:43,733
Shiori

526
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:46,731
How?

527
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:50,075
How would it be?

528
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:50,940
Shiori

529
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:03,620
The criminal has a gun

530
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:05,559
Shiori, be strong

531
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:08,257
Shiori

532
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:10,456
Light

533
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:12,561
Shiori

534
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,240
We are kissing in the public

535
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:33,516
Shiori

536
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:36,519
Shiori

537
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:40,523
Shiori

538
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:44,822
Why?

539
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,866
Why you shot Shiori?

540
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:51,028
Why?

541
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:54,036
Shiori

542
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:57,339
Shiori

543
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,139
Why?

544
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:04,642
Stop

545
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:20,199
This is the result of misjudge

546
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:23,135
The misjudge of Naomi Misora

547
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:25,402
was discovered by me

548
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:33,515
and her fault about telling
me she was Raye's fiancee

549
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:37,882
Nobody will use a fake name in the wedding

550
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,356
and church is open to everybody

551
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:43,888
It's not difficult
to find out Naomi Misora real name

552
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:45,553
[ Raye Penber ]

553
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:48,358
[ Naomi Misora ]

554
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:55,861
Naomi Misora, commit suicide

555
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:59,508
For the purpose of her death fiancee

556
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,772
Lure the suspect out

557
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:04,369
to the art gallery

558
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:08,814
Kidnap the suspect's girl friend

559
00:50:08,851 --> 00:50:11,581
At 14:15 15th April 2006

560
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:18,255
let the hostage make a call to the suspect

561
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:22,387
Get the second evidence

562
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:25,429
By the guarding of the investigation team

563
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:29,460
Try to let the criminal expose his crimes

564
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:32,474
but as seeing the hostage was running away

565
00:50:32,508 --> 00:50:36,239
14:55 tried to stop the hostage...

566
00:50:38,214 --> 00:50:40,648
Then she became insane

567
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,907
and killed herself

568
00:51:05,741 --> 00:51:06,332
Sorry

569
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:12,172
If we could arrive earlier...

570
00:51:18,354 --> 00:51:22,552
I go to order people to prepare a car

571
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,359
I've never thought Shiori would be killed

572
00:51:29,398 --> 00:51:31,298
You also misjudge

573
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:44,441
The person who killed Shiori is me too

574
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,252
I definitely use the Death Note

575
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,719
That's weird

576
00:51:54,223 --> 00:51:57,124
Shiori was killed by Naomi

577
00:51:57,226 --> 00:52:00,593
but you cannot write an action
to kill other people in Death Note

578
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:06,534
If the name is written
then she'll die in heart paralyse

579
00:52:06,635 --> 00:52:08,865
I knew it definitely

580
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:14,398
So I only gave instructions to Naomi

581
00:52:14,443 --> 00:52:17,207
and then wrote down
Shiori's name in the next page

582
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:25,051
[ Naomi Misora, committed suicide,
lead the suspect to the art gallery ]

583
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:30,186
Shiori, killed by other people

584
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:37,461
She is involved in the kidnapping case
in the art gallery

585
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:39,899
14:15 15th April 2006

586
00:52:42,604 --> 00:52:45,300
force to call boy friend

587
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:50,438
Try to runaway when police arrives

588
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:54,544
14:55 When the kidnapper shot

589
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:58,380
For the purpose of protecting her boy friend

590
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,820
and was shot to death

591
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:07,493
I didn't write about Naomi killed Shiori

592
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:10,987
I didn't write about Shiori
was killed by Naomi too

593
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:15,561
So Naomi kills Shiori was an accident?

594
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:23,307
If from the point of killing Shiori

595
00:53:23,345 --> 00:53:27,805
the percentage of success is extraordinary

596
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:28,947
It's not accident

597
00:53:28,984 --> 00:53:32,613
All happened according to my plan

598
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:36,483
I wrote Shiori was shot to death

599
00:53:39,294 --> 00:53:43,822
and Naomi killed herself by using her gun

600
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,366
This is because
normally nobody will bring a gun in Japan

601
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:52,203
If Shiori was killed here

602
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:56,041
Then it was done by Naomi

603
00:53:58,213 --> 00:54:00,374
Do you know it, Ryuk?

604
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:02,577
Names whose be written

605
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:06,918
Their fate will be changed in naturally

606
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:11,383
So even though I do not
write Naomi killed Shiori

607
00:54:11,427 --> 00:54:14,396
but all the things would
happen according to my plan

608
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,728
You're... a real devil

609
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,104
My Shiori died in front of me

610
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:33,642
Now if I give the reason of defeating KIRA
and wish to join the investigation team

611
00:54:33,682 --> 00:54:37,880
Everyone will feel pity and believe me

612
00:54:44,293 --> 00:54:44,987
Shiori

613
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:54,927
Light, you look like Shinigami more than we do

614
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:05,303
Shiori has indeed loved you

615
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:10,610
Don't you love Shiori?

616
00:55:17,326 --> 00:55:19,419
I also don't know

617
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:31,533
Misa, do you feel lonely?

618
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:34,807
No, don't come over here

619
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:38,506
Wish to die... that's what Misa wants

620
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,913
I don't have that kind of wish

621
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:44,316
Let's go, let's go to parents' heaven

622
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:46,878
I want to die with you

623
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,890
You, are you kidding?

624
00:55:53,762 --> 00:55:58,324
Do you know the consequences if you do so?

625
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:01,234
In recording room,
in the lobby of TV station

626
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,034
I am watching you all the time

627
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,937
I want to die with you

628
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:09,171
To die for you is my mission

629
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:11,468
Bullshit

630
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:17,414
Misa doesn't want to go to heaven or hell

631
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:29,193
Don't be afraid, I won't make you pain

632
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:29,720
Stop

633
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:36,268
Help me, is somebody out there?

634
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,431
Light

635
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:47,970
The car is here

636
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:52,670
Let's go home

637
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:56,244
Dad, I've a request

638
00:57:58,654 --> 00:57:59,382
Say it

639
00:58:00,255 --> 00:58:05,090
Please let me join the investigation team

640
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:09,754
My beloved Shiori was killed by KIRA

641
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:13,933
I absolutely will not forgive KIRA

642
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:19,271
So, please let me join
the investigation team

643
00:58:20,976 --> 00:58:21,772
Welcome

644
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:36,323
This is the first time we meet, Light Yagami

645
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:38,322
I am L

646
00:58:42,831 --> 00:58:47,063
Please use your smart brain to help us

647
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:50,029
to arrest KIRA

648
00:59:07,355 --> 00:59:10,483
Before that, please apologies
