look like an alien.

a human being again,
don't it?

you wanted, Seeker.

have seen a lot,

nothing like this.

ready to harvest.

Can't come too soon.
We sure need the grain.

552
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,826
Everyone here thinks
you're going to betray
us to the Seekers.

553
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,289
Makes sense.

554
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:14,209
Why else
would you be here?

555
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:18,046
What I can't wrap
my head around is
what kind of a plan was that?

556
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,590
Walking into the desert
with no backup

557
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,426
and no way
to get yourself back?

558
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,344
So if,
like you say, you weren't
coming here for the Seekers,

559
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,305
why were you doing it?

560
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:29,433
Then I started thinking,
when they put one of you
in our heads,

561
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:33,103
do we still exist?
Trapped in there?

562
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:36,940
If our memories are
still alive, are we?

563
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,610
You gotta believe
some people wouldn't
go down without a fight.

564
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,111
Hell, I know
I wouldn't go quiet.

565
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,864
And I've never seen
fight like in Mel.

566
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:47,868
What she'd fight for,
more than anything,
is the people that she loves.

567
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,623
I wonder

568
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:57,544
if a love like that might
play on someone's mind.

570
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:05,219

somebody to do something
they wouldn't ordinarily do.

01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:25,389
This war is over.

713
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:28,058
The last of the resistance
will die out on its own.

714
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:29,476
They will become extinct.

715
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:34,481
But I think there is a war
raging in you, Seeker.

716
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,483
We're going home.
So are you.

717
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,320
You don't know
what's going on.

718
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:48,537
We are losing control.

719
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,128
<i>DOC:  Wanda.</i>

720
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,505
If you don't
mind me asking,
how old are you?

721
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:03,093
Over a thousand
of your years.

722
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:07,055
I have not completed
one full revolution
of your sun,

723
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:10,851
yet I have found that
Earth is more beautiful

724
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,063
and harder than
any place I have ever been.

725
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:17,941
I've gotta say,
this is the most
interesting conversation

726
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,359
I've had in forever.
JARED: What is this?

727
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:22,905
This has gone on
long enough!

728
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:25,407
Out of the way!

729
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:26,909
She's not a threat.
JARED: No?

730
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,913
Aaron and Brandt are dead

731
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,623
thanks to the Seeker
looking for it.

732
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:36,001
Almost got us, too.

733
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:39,922
I'm gonna end this
once and for all!

734
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:40,631
JAMIE: Jared!

735
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,341
You can't!

736
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:44,051
Why not?

737
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:46,136
Because if you kill Wanda...

738
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:47,429
<i>MELANIE:  Oh, no, Jamie!</i>

739
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:50,891
...you'll kill Melanie.

740
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:53,435
She's still alive in there.

741
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:56,939
I believe it.

742
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:01,276
You're all
letting it fool you!

743
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,626
Come on, Jamie.

744
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:29,638
I'm so sorry.
I'll go back to my cell.

745
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,473
No.

746
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:34,434
This'll blow over.

747
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,395
You can stay
in my place.

748
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,982
She'll be safe there.

749
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:42,276
Mmm.

750
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:51,034
You tried to kill me
and now you're protecting me?

751
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:54,329
Strange world, isn't it?

752
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:58,625
The strangest.

753
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,550
JARED:
What's wrong with you, Doc?

754
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,427
DOC: You want to try? You try.

755
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:12,973
IAN: Wanda?

756
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:15,976
I just want you to know
that I trust you.

757
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,229
And I believe you're
telling us the truth.

758
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:21,398
But I... I gotta ask.

759
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:25,277
What's it like
for you and her,
living in there together?

760
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:27,529
It's crowded.

761
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:34,161
Let me know
if you need anything.

762
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,205
I'll just be
right out here.

763
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:45,464
(EXHALES)

764
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:54,264
<i>MELANIE:  I think
he likes you too much.</i>

765
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:56,391
What is too much?

766
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:59,686
<i>If I've got
anything to do with it,
you'll never find out.</i>

767
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:23,085
(GASPS)

768
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:31,510
I know it's with you.

769
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,512
<i>MELANIE:  Oh, God.</i>

770
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,264
JARED: I'm not gonna kill it.

771
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,432
I just want to talk to it.

772
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:41,645
It's okay.
I will talk to him.

773
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:48,819
Her name is Wanda,
not "it."

774
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,417
I'm so sorry about
what happened out there,

775
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:04,751
to your friends.

776
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:09,381
I never meant to hurt anyone.

777
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:13,427
Wanda,

778
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:16,138
Jamie and Jeb believe,

779
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:18,390
Ian, too,

780
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,644
that Mel is still
alive and kicking in there.

781
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:24,229
<i>MELANIE:  I am!</i>

782
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,106
<i>I am!</i>

783
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:30,819
In fact,
Jeb has this crazy notion that
you're here for Jamie and me.

784
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:34,448
You brought
Melanie back to us.

785
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:37,367
I can't believe it.

786
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:39,661
I don't want to believe it
because her being in there,

787
01:08:40,621 --> 01:08:41,830
trapped,

788
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:45,584
that makes it
so much worse somehow.

789
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:51,798
But I gotta know.

790
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:56,220
Is Melanie in there?

791
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,431
<i>Just tell him I'm here.
Tell him I love him.</i>

792
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,225
(WHISPERS) I'm afraid.

793
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,143
You see,
the thing is, Wanda,

794
01:09:04,812 --> 01:09:06,647
I haven't stopped
dreaming about Melanie.

795
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:08,690
<i>I dream about you, too.</i>

796
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:11,568
I miss
everything about her.

797
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:14,863
And I would do
anything to get her back.

798
01:09:14,863 --> 01:09:16,657
You know what makes
this so much harder?

799
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:18,659
It's still her body.

800
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:21,870
If it wasn't
for those eyes...

801
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:25,833
I got to thinking.

802
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:29,878
If I can't kiss her,

803
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:33,882
I can kiss you.

804
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,510
<i>What? No!
What is he doing?</i>

805
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:39,513
<i>No! Stop it!</i>

806
01:09:39,513 --> 01:09:41,181
<i>Stop! Now!</i>

807
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:42,891
<i>Don't do this!</i>

808
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,935
<i>No! No!</i>

809
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:48,564
I knew it.

810
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:50,941
Mel.

811
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,360
You're really in there.

812
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,736
You hit me
for kissing it.

813
01:09:55,654 --> 01:09:58,240
Mel, I love you.

814
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:01,243
I know you can't
say it back,
but I love you.

815
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:13,714
<i>MELANIE:  So now
he believes it, too.</i>

816
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:16,758
<i>It doesn't help anyone.</i>

817
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:19,595
<i>Knowing I'm a prisoner in hee
just hurts them more.</i>

818
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,931
KYLE: Wanda!

819
01:10:23,307 --> 01:10:24,433
<i>Hide.</i>

820
01:10:24,475 --> 01:10:25,976
<i>Hide! Hide!</i>

821
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:28,979
Wanda.

822
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:54,296
Wanda!

823
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,466
(GASPS)

824
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:05,265
<i>Wanda, get out of here!</i>

825
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:07,434
<i>Run!</i>

826
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:10,270
<i>Run!</i>

827
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:14,858
(GRUNTING)

828
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,424
Grab my hand!

829
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:40,759
<i>What are you doing? Let go!</i>

830
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:44,513
<i>Good! If he dies,
he can't kill us!</i>

831
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:46,056
No!

832
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,560
Help!

833
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:51,520
Help!

834
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,538
You're lucky
your head's harder than
any rock in this place.

835
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,374
You'll live.

836
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:13,876
Don't be too sure
about that, Doc.

837
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:15,002
What happened?

838
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:16,837
<i>Tell him.</i>

839
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:20,716
It was an accident.

840
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:22,009
<i>Like hell!</i>

841
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:23,969
<i>I thought you didn't lie.</i>

842
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:25,471
Kyle slipped.

843
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:26,847
Sure he did.

844
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:28,515
If that's what
it says happened...

845
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,017
Oh, come on.
We all know what happened.

846
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,481
He tried to kill her.

847
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,567
And for some unknown reason,
she saved his sorry ass.

848
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:42,112
If it's true,
Kyle, you're out.

849
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,365
Did he try to kill you?

850
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:52,080
It's not saying he did.

851
01:12:56,877 --> 01:12:59,421
You're the one
who has to live
under the same roof.

852
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:02,716
Kyle, I'm warning you.

853
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:05,719
Don't you even
look at her wrong.

854
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:09,097
I haven't shot anyone
in a long time.
Kind of miss the thrill of it.

855
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,894
We gotta get back to work.

856
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,938
Come on, let's go.

857
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,566
JARED: Hey, Jeb.

858
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,154
We're going back out.

859
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,739
JEB: Too many
Seekers out there.
JARED: No.

860
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,616
We lost a lot
on that last run.

861
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,954
There are a couple
of things that I need.

862
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:35,916
Take Kyle with you.

863
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:40,587
Come on, Kyle.

864
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:42,798
And, you,

865
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,716
keep away from her.

866
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,456
You want to take a walk?

867
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:22,212
Didn't Jared tell you
to stay away from me?

868
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:25,507
Yeah.

869
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:28,969
<i>MELANIE:
This is not a good idea.</i>

870
01:14:32,973 --> 01:14:34,933
You can
open your eyes now.

871
01:14:39,104 --> 01:14:40,189
I'm outside!
(CHUCKLES)

872
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:45,152
That really is the sky.

873
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,756
I like you, Wanda.

874
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:07,132
I like you, too, Ian.

875
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:08,550
<i>MELANIE:  You did not say that.</i>

876
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,843
No.

877
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:12,221
Not like that.

878
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:15,557
<i>Get his hands off me!</i>

879
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:17,643
<i>This can't work.
What are you doing?</i>

880
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:19,603
Let me guess.

881
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:22,564
You're of two minds
about it.

882
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:25,609
Is this about Jared?

883
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:26,902
<i>Yes, it's about Jared.</i>

884
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,987
Melanie is in love with him.

885
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,072
And you?

886
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:32,199
<i>Tell him. Tell him!</i>

887
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,286
This body loves him.

888
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,165
Since it is now my body,

889
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:43,794
so do I.

890
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,133
But I also have
feelings of my own.

<i>No, you don't.</i>

892
01:15:58,183 --> 01:15:59,768
<i>Wanda, no.</i>

<i>Stop!</i>

894
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:04,648
<i>You are not going there.</i>

895
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:06,275
<i>What about Jared?</i>

896
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:11,321
This is very complicated.

897
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,744
Is there any way Melanie
can give us some privacy?

898
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:20,914
Look the other way
a moment?

899
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:21,957
Step into the other room?

<i>You wish.</i>

901
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:27,171
I don't think that's
possible right now.

903
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:36,054
it's not really me you like.

904

It's this body.

905
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,977
You couldn't care for me.

906
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:47,900
If you could hold me,

907
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:50,152
me,

01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:52,112
in your hand,

909
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:54,656
you'd be disgusted.

910
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,827
You would crush me.

911
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,330
You don't know that.

912
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,043
<i>Wanda! No!
This is so wrong.</i>

from the same planet!</i>

<i>I'll do something.
I'll hurt him!</i>

915
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:16,845
Strange to be in a body
that won't let me use it.

916
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:27,648

better take me back.

I'm still of two minds.

920
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:40,702
Okay.

921
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,923
You're angry when
I kiss a man you do love

922
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:55,008
and angry when
I kiss a man you don't.

923
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:56,885

to go and lay down.

All you are going to do

is keep murdering
more of both of us.

I'm sorry.

It's infected.
It's got into
Jamie's bloodstream.

There's no medicine out there.
You souls have
destroyed it all.

01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,252
Jamie.
Hey, buddy.

1069
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:32,261
You're getting good, Doc.
(ALL LAUGHING)

1070
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:54,950
<i>I've walked out of
plenty of stores
without paying.</i>

1071
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:57,327
<i>First time anyone's
been happy about it.</i>

1072
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,835
I liked it better
when we were stealing.

1073
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:06,587
You spoil everything,
Wanda.

1074
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:27,024
WANDERER: No, Wes!

1075
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:43,165
Hello, Wanderer.

1076
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:48,879
Seeker.

1077
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:14,655
Why did you waste
the medicine on me?

1078
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:17,908
Aren't you
going to kill me?

1079
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:23,997
Can I speak
to her alone?

1080
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:25,707
<i>MELANIE:  Does that include me?</i>

1081
01:34:27,084 --> 01:34:28,877
<i>I guess it does.</i>

1082
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:30,838
We'll be outside,
Wanda.

1083
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:35,175
You just say the word.

1084
01:34:40,973 --> 01:34:42,224
SEEKER: Huh!

1085
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:44,143
Wanda?

1086
01:34:44,143 --> 01:34:45,894
Surely,
you go by "Melanie" now.

1087
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,274
Did you ask to kill me
yourself, Melanie?

1088
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,193
What are you
waiting for?

1089
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:55,904
I'm not here
to kill you.

1090
01:34:56,446 --> 01:34:57,739
Oh.

1091
01:35:02,202 --> 01:35:04,246
You're my interrogator.

1092
01:35:11,378 --> 01:35:13,922
I do want to
know something.

1093
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:19,178
Why?

1094
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:22,222
Why couldn't you
just let me go?

1095
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:24,266
Because I was right.

1096
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:30,105
I know the threat
a weak soul like
you represents.

1097
01:35:30,105 --> 01:35:33,775
Unlike you,
I am doing my duty.
I am fighting for us.

1098
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:35,861
We cannot live with them
like the other worlds.

1099
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:39,072
You, more than anyone,
know that.

1100
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:42,993
Did you come alone?

1101
01:35:44,453 --> 01:35:46,788
Other Seekers will
come looking for me,

1102
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:49,166
just like I came
looking for you.

1103
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:51,293
No one else is
coming to find you.

1104
01:35:52,795 --> 01:35:56,173
You die,
and the danger
dies with you.

1105
01:35:57,132 --> 01:35:59,009
The people here
will be safe.

1106
01:36:01,929 --> 01:36:03,847
So you are
going to kill me.

1107
01:36:13,816 --> 01:36:17,194
<i>Wanda, what is this?
What are you thinking?</i>

1108
01:36:17,194 --> 01:36:20,322
<i>Don't put up
walls against me.
Talk to me.</i>

1109
01:36:51,854 --> 01:36:53,230
Wanda?

1110
01:36:56,817 --> 01:36:58,527
I never got the chance
to say how truly...

1111
01:36:58,527 --> 01:37:00,362
There's a way
to make up for it.

1112
01:37:01,947 --> 01:37:05,409
what you have been
ending so many lives
trying to do.

1113
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:08,453
I can take a soul
from a body.

1114
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:10,080
<i>MELANIE:  You can do what?</i>

1115
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:13,375
<i>What are you saying, Wanda?</i>

1116
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:15,544
I will only
give you this knowledge

1117
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:18,464
on the condition
you do as I ask

1118
01:37:18,464 --> 01:37:20,883
and promise that no harm
will come to any soul.

1119
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,552
I can promise you that.

1120
01:37:23,552 --> 01:37:26,889
There's one other thing
you must promise.

1121
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:29,892
And you must promise
to keep it a secret.

1122
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,900
You have to let me die.

1123
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,067
<i>No! No! No!</i>

1124
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,862
I can't do that, Wanda.

1125
01:37:42,905 --> 01:37:45,491
I... I can't.

1126
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:47,618
It's the only way
I can give you
what you want.

1127
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,244
<i>Wanda.</i>

1128
01:37:50,078 --> 01:37:51,205
<i>No.</i>

1129
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:05,260
She's out.

1130
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:08,096
JEB: So you don't want us
to kill the Seeker.

1131
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:11,892
She killed Wes.
Who knows how many others?

1132
01:38:11,892 --> 01:38:13,602
She wouldn't blink
about butchering us.

1133
01:38:13,602 --> 01:38:15,312
There's been
too much killing.

1134
01:38:16,605 --> 01:38:18,607
Not death. Exile.

1135
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:22,569
You want us to forgive her.

1136
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:25,280
And let them go,
just like that?

1137
01:38:26,406 --> 01:38:27,616
Yes.

1138
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:44,383
We souls can leave
the same way we arrived.

1139
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,636
I will send her away.

1140
01:38:47,636 --> 01:38:50,139
By the time
she reaches
another planet,

1141
01:38:50,139 --> 01:38:53,183
your grandchildren
will have died of old age.

1142
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:24,506
You have always tried
to extract it by force.

1143
01:39:26,258 --> 01:39:29,261
The secret is,
you do not remove it,

1144
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:31,346
it removes itself.

1145
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:35,434
You coax it out.

1146
01:39:37,269 --> 01:39:41,356
You have always
seen it as the enemy.
It can feel the hate.

1147
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:46,528
It can only be
captured by kindness.

1148
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:50,032
Love.

1149
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,424
Ian, help me.

1150
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:06,775
Thank you.

1151
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,738
What is your name?

1152
01:41:11,738 --> 01:41:13,115
I'm Lacey. (LAUGHS)

1153
01:41:13,782 --> 01:41:16,493
My name is Lacey.

1154
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,704
I've been
screaming inside for years.

1155
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:21,248
Nobody could hear me.

1156
01:41:21,248 --> 01:41:23,792
You're the reason
why she wouldn't
leave me alone.

1157
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:27,171
Yes, she wasn't
just after humans.

1158
01:41:27,171 --> 01:41:29,339
She was hoping to find
a way to fight the hosts.

1159
01:41:31,133 --> 01:41:32,426
Like me.

1160
01:41:33,552 --> 01:41:35,137
And you, Melanie.

1161
01:41:36,472 --> 01:41:38,474
Who fight back.

1162
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:08,170
Have a safe trip.

1163
01:42:09,338 --> 01:42:10,714
<i>MELANIE:  And a long one.</i>

1164
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:20,849
<i>WANDERER:
Always send the souls to
the most distant planets.</i>

1165
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,853
Wanda?

1166
01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:29,608
Do you miss it out there?

1167
01:42:31,527 --> 01:42:32,903
The other worlds?

1168
01:42:35,364 --> 01:42:37,241
I miss many things.

1169
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:40,869
Don't you miss Melanie?

1170
01:42:40,869 --> 01:42:43,205
Don't you want
your sister back?

1171
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:46,875
She's here now.

1172
01:42:47,793 --> 01:42:49,878
<i>MELANIE:  You know he's right.</i>

1173
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,258
Not the way
she needs to be.

1174
01:43:00,681 --> 01:43:02,391
I think it's time
to move on.

1175
01:43:02,391 --> 01:43:03,851
Leave us?

1176
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:09,481
Yes.

1177
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:11,650
But you can always
come back, right?

1178
01:43:26,874 --> 01:43:30,252
I asked you here
so no one would shout.

1179
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:32,588
<i>I wish I could
shout loud enough
for them to hear.</i>

1180
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:39,261
As soon as I knew
what to do with the Seeker,

1181
01:43:39,261 --> 01:43:43,474
I knew there was
a way for all of you
to get your loved ones back.

1182
01:43:43,474 --> 01:43:44,892
Without hurting the souls.

1183
01:43:48,604 --> 01:43:50,272
But, of course,

1184
01:43:52,608 --> 01:43:55,819
I knew I had to give
Melanie back to herself.

1185
01:43:56,904 --> 01:43:58,447
And leave.

1186
01:43:58,447 --> 01:44:00,532
That can't happen, Wanda.
We need you.

1187
01:44:01,283 --> 01:44:06,788
<i>MELANIE:  Tell them the truth.
You're not leaving this worl.</i>

1188
01:44:06,788 --> 01:44:09,708
<i>Tell them what
you're really gonna do.</i>

1189
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:11,794
Now that you
have this knowledge

1190
01:44:11,794 --> 01:44:13,670
of how to extract
a soul from a body,

1191
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:15,339
you can survive without me.

1192
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:16,965
And what does Mel say?

1193
01:44:16,965 --> 01:44:18,675
She's always
wanted her life back.

1194
01:44:18,675 --> 01:44:19,802
<i>Don't speak for me.</i>

1195
01:44:20,427 --> 01:44:22,471
You're lying.

1196
01:44:24,264 --> 01:44:25,933
I have to go.

1197
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:33,315
You don't have to
decide right now.

1198
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:36,819
Think about it.

1199
01:44:38,821 --> 01:44:40,614
Promise me
you'll think about it.

1200
01:45:03,053 --> 01:45:06,515
You are not leaving me.

1201
01:45:06,515 --> 01:45:07,808
I can't stay.

1202
01:45:14,064 --> 01:45:15,399
But I love you.

1203
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:18,527
I love you.

1204
01:45:20,571 --> 01:45:23,031
Don't say it like
you're saying goodbye.

1205
01:45:29,037 --> 01:45:31,540
I love you in
every way that I can.

1206
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:34,918
And I'll miss
you the most.

1207
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:40,007
I miss the future
I might have had with you.

1208
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:41,884
You're willing
to sacrifice that?

1209
01:45:41,884 --> 01:45:44,428
Sometimes we have
to make sacrifices.

1210
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:48,348
No, I can't let you go.
I won't.
Let me talk to Melanie.

1211
01:45:48,348 --> 01:45:50,726
She's not there right now.

1212
01:45:50,726 --> 01:45:54,688
She stepped
into the other room,
so I can kiss you.

1213
01:46:53,705 --> 01:46:55,874
I really can't
talk you out of it?

1214
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:59,419
No. It's time.

1215
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:02,923
I want to die.

1216
01:47:04,049 --> 01:47:06,468
If you had lived
a millennium

1217
01:47:06,468 --> 01:47:09,471
always in the body of another,
you might feel
the same way yourself.

1218
01:47:16,019 --> 01:47:18,605
<i>MELANIE:  Wanda, my sister.</i>

1219
01:47:18,605 --> 01:47:20,107
Yes, sister?

1220
01:47:21,191 --> 01:47:23,152
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

1221
01:47:25,821 --> 01:47:29,908
Don't you want to be
with Jared? And Jamie?

1222
01:47:29,908 --> 01:47:32,619
<i>It doesn't have
to be this way.</i>

1223
01:47:32,619 --> 01:47:34,163
<i>You don't have to die.</i>

1224
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:39,668
<i>You really could
go to another world,</i>

1225
01:47:39,668 --> 01:47:41,670
<i>the way you've been
telling everyone.</i>

1226
01:47:44,465 --> 01:47:46,467
Thank you,

1227
01:47:48,177 --> 01:47:51,096
but by the time I got
to the closest planet,

1228
01:47:52,055 --> 01:47:57,144
you, Jamie, Jared, Ian,

1229
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:04,193
everyone on this
world I care about
would be long dead.

1230
01:48:08,113 --> 01:48:10,532
I don't want to
go on without you.

1231
01:48:15,996 --> 01:48:17,539
I love you, Mel.

1232
01:48:18,707 --> 01:48:20,125
<i>I love you.</i>

1233
01:48:22,211 --> 01:48:27,549
<i>You are the purest soul,
human or not,
that I've ever met.</i>

1234
01:48:30,052 --> 01:48:32,971
<i>The universe will
be a darker place
without you.</i>

1235
01:48:38,685 --> 01:48:40,562
Be happy, Mel.

1236
01:48:42,815 --> 01:48:44,608
Be happy

1237
01:48:46,151 --> 01:48:48,779
that after living
so many lives,

1238
01:48:51,073 --> 01:48:53,826
I finally found
something to die for.

1239
01:49:02,084 --> 01:49:04,002
<i>Goodbye.
Goodbye.</i>

1240
01:49:35,117 --> 01:49:36,743
IAN: Wanda?

1241
01:49:36,743 --> 01:49:38,162
Wanda.

1242
01:49:41,665 --> 01:49:43,292
Wanda?

1243
01:49:43,292 --> 01:49:45,127
Wanda, can you hear me?

1244
01:49:46,086 --> 01:49:47,629
WANDERER: Where am I?

1245
01:49:48,589 --> 01:49:50,090
Who am I?

1246
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:51,717
You're you.

1247
01:49:56,889 --> 01:49:58,640
Hello, Wanda.

1248
01:49:59,183 --> 01:50:00,976
WANDERER: Melanie?

1249
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:05,647
You might want
to see yourself.

1250
01:50:18,827 --> 01:50:19,995
IAN: You still do that
with your hair.

1251
01:50:40,974 --> 01:50:42,726
Doc, you broke your word.

1252
01:50:42,726 --> 01:50:47,397
They broke it for me.
They made me keep you alive.

1253
01:50:47,397 --> 01:50:48,398
But I told you
I didn't want to

1254
01:50:48,398 --> 01:50:49,733
take another life
in any world.

1255
01:50:49,733 --> 01:50:54,321
JEB: We've been taking
souls out of humans
for a month now.

1256
01:50:54,321 --> 01:50:57,407
But when we took
the soul out of that body,

1257
01:50:57,407 --> 01:50:58,742
she never woke up.

1258
01:50:58,742 --> 01:51:00,035
The body was dying.

1259
01:51:00,035 --> 01:51:02,871
The only way
to save her was to
put you inside.

1260
01:51:04,706 --> 01:51:07,876
You haven't killed a body.
You've given it life.

1261
01:51:11,338 --> 01:51:12,840
I miss you in my head.

1262
01:51:17,344 --> 01:51:18,720
What are you thinking,
Wanda?

1263
01:51:22,432 --> 01:51:24,893
I'm thinking how happy I am.

1264
01:51:30,232 --> 01:51:31,775
(RAIN DRIPPING)

1265
01:51:52,254 --> 01:51:54,381
It's a strange world.

1266
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:56,758
The strangest.

1267
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:08,228
<i>NARRATOR:  Our world isn't like
the other worlds they came t.</i>

1268
01:52:08,228 --> 01:52:10,314
<i>The way they see it,</i>

1269
01:52:10,314 --> 01:52:15,944
<i>human beings
are just so alien.</i>

1270
01:52:15,944 --> 01:52:19,948
<i>But if one of them
can find a way
to live with one of us,</i>

1271
01:52:21,783 --> 01:52:23,202
<i>I wonder.</i>

1272
01:52:46,433 --> 01:52:47,476
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Seekers.

1273
01:52:50,145 --> 01:52:51,355
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

1274
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:57,152
No one gets taken.

1275
01:53:08,122 --> 01:53:09,123
Everybody out.

1276
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:16,964
Seeker, I can...
Everybody out.

1277
01:53:18,799 --> 01:53:20,008
Now.

1278
01:53:34,857 --> 01:53:36,108
Hmm.

1279
01:53:36,108 --> 01:53:37,401
Little bright out
tonight, is it?

1280
01:53:47,077 --> 01:53:47,953
You're human.

1281
01:53:57,087 --> 01:53:58,338
Human.

1282
01:54:00,924 --> 01:54:02,468
Mmm-hmm.

1283
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:08,515
Not all human.

1284
01:54:13,228 --> 01:54:14,146
Are you their prisoner?

1285
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:16,482
(GUN CLICKING)

1286
01:54:21,153 --> 01:54:22,070
Yes.
No.

1287
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:25,449
I'm not their prisoner.

1288
01:54:29,912 --> 01:54:31,246
I'm their friend.

1289
01:54:33,874 --> 01:54:35,209
They're human.

1290
01:54:43,008 --> 01:54:44,927
Human as you.

1291
01:54:46,637 --> 01:54:47,554
(CHUCKLES)

1292
01:54:49,223 --> 01:54:51,058
We thought we were
the last survivors.

1293
01:54:51,058 --> 01:54:52,559
So did we.

1294
01:54:54,436 --> 01:54:56,605
Till we found
three other groups.

1295
01:54:57,272 --> 01:54:58,941
Now four.

1296
01:55:01,068 --> 01:55:03,487
Thought I was the only one
who switched sides.

1297
01:55:03,487 --> 01:55:05,906
I guess you never know where
you're gonna find your home.
