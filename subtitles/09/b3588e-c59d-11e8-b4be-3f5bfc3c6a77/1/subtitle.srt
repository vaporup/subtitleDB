1
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,191
Up! Up!

2
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,191
Hurry!

3
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,191
Don't push!

4
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,191
Hurry!

5
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,191
Up the tree, quickly!

6
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,193
Pull him down quickly. Quickly!

7
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,191
Catch the flag.

8
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,191
Wait.

9
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,191
Don't let him get down!

10
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,191
Hurry!

11
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,191
Careful!

12
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,191
Calm down!

13
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,193
The winner this year is...
Ai Bak Tim!

14
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Sawadee everyone...

15
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
from Ban Nong Pradoo.

16
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
We are gathering for good merit at this festival,

17
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,200
to give robes to the monks, and Ong-Bak,

18
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,200
who is the protective icon for the well-being of our village.

19
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
This festival...

20
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
is to remind us that...

21
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
in 7 days we will be...

22
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,591
celebrating Ong-Bak.

23
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
The last time...

24
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,193
being 24 years ago.

25
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
This means...

26
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,193
all prosperity will return to us once more.

27
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,191
Where is the amulet?

28
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
It's not good.

29
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
There is a little damage...

30
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Not quite perfect.

31
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,200
200,000 baht for this is not cheap.

32
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,193
Why don't you want to sell it?

33
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Ow! How much do you want?

34
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Don. I'm not selling.

35
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Ow! Why did you change your mind?

36
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I came a long way from Bangkok just for this.

37
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I've never given you any promise...

38
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
to sell it to you.

39
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I want to give this to my son, Bak Hum Lae,

40
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,193
the day he's ordained here as a monk, for Ong-Bak.

41
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Call me whenever you want to sell it.

42
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
No, no. I don't have a telephone.

43
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I'll give you my address,

44
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
so whenever you want to sell,

45
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,191
you can write to me.

46
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Is this good enough, grandma?

47
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I made it for Ai Tim for his ordination.

48
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
It's good.

49
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Where did Ai Tim come from,

50
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
and how come he grew up in the temple?

51
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
He's now a man.

52
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Ai Tim is an orphan.

53
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
He was left at the temple by someone...

54
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
when he was a baby.

55
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Pra Kroo took pity on him,

56
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,191
and adopted him.

57
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
And everyone says...

58
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,193
he has grown up well under Ong-Bak.

59
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Hitting the earth!

60
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,191
Crocodile whipping tail!

61
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Confronting elephant!

62
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Hanuman (Monkey) giving ring.

63
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
The threatening fight.

64
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
The rear kick.

65
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Both elbows attacking...

66
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
followed with high knee.

67
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Raising the army.

68
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Getting high strength.

69
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Cutting through the enemy.

70
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Avoiding danger.

71
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Putting your head down.

72
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Knight throwing an axe.

73
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Wave smashing the shore.

74
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,191
Meet friend, join friend.

75
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Knight catching monkeys.

76
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,191
Breaking the joins.

77
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Snake chasing lizard.

78
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Cliff shaking.

79
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Sticky water.

80
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Throwing the spear.

81
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Breaking the sword.

82
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Raising the body.

83
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,191
Horse replacing bird.

84
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
I'll teach you all these styles...

85
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,193
but I forbid you to use them for money.

86
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Do you understand, Bak Tim?

87
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I understand, Pra Kroo.

88
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,191
Good.

89
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
He has gone.

90
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,193
You said you understood. Really?

91
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
There is a story that...

92
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Pra Kroo learnt this boxing...

93
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,200
from the ancient books.

94
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Then Pra Kroo wanted a challenge.

95
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
He went into the boxing ring for money...

96
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,193
and he hit his opponent to death.

97
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
He felt very guilty,

98
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
so he became a monk.

99
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,191
Thai boxing is very dangerous.

100
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,443
I don't want you to use it,
unless it is absolutely necessary.

101
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,191
Understand?

102
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,193
Or are you still not clear?

103
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Come, fight with me.

104
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Ai Bak, here.

105
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,191
- Uncle!
- Come on!

106
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,193
Who is there? What are you doing?

107
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,091
Hurry!

108
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Bak Don...

109
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,193
is the one that cut off the head of Ong-Bak.

110
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
He took all the donation money too, Pra Kroo.

111
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,193
Bak Don! Evil son!

112
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
If Pra Ong-Bak has no head,

113
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,200
our village will be faced with disaster.

114
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Calm down. Calm down!

115
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200
We must try to get Ong-Bak's head back...

116
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,200
to our village before the ceremony day.

117
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,193
Where can we find it, Pra Kroo?

118
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I will bring Ong-Bak back here myself.

119
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,193
Who knows where Bak Don is?

120
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,200
The hopes of the people of Ban Nong Pradoo Sukon...

121
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,200
are in your hands.

122
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
In this tube is a holy herbal medicine.

123
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
My teacher told me...

124
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
it belonged to Kroo Dum.

125
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,191
Keep it with you.

126
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,191
This is the address of Bak Don.

127
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
And this is a letter to Bak Hum Lae.

128
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,193
Tim, you must return with Ong-Bak...

129
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,191
to our village.

130
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,193
This is the money for your journey.

131
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,191
All my hopes are with you.

132
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,193
My mom gave me this ring before she died.

133
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,193
Warn, please look after grandma.

134
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,193
We've all contributed together...

135
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,193
for the fares.

136
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,191
He's losing.

137
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Hey! What bike you using to race?

138
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Why did you lose so easily like this?

139
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Hey! Why are you speaking that way?

140
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Win or lose is normal in any bet.

141
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
It isn't fair to blame me.

142
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Why did you use a woman to race with me?

143
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Why not?
What's wrong with being a woman?

144
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Ow! You dare race against me!

145
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
You cow!

146
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
If you rode as fast as your mouth, you'd probably win!

147
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,191
Hey! Hey!

148
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Hey! Why don't you pay me in cash?

149
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
You bet me with drugs, didn't you?

150
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,193
You told me it was okay to use drugs instead of cash.

151
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,191
Okay.

152
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I'll give you only 10,000...

153
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
after deducting the 10,000 you owe me.

154
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
I pay you interest every month,

155
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
and the loan is not yet due.

156
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Can't you give me all the money now?

157
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Do you want it or not?

158
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,193
Okay. Better than nothing.

159
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Hey! Give me all of that.

160
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
What!

161
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,191
Give me!

162
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
You've already got my money.

163
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Can't you give a few tablets to my friends?

164
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
You can find this drug anywhere...

165
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
you don't have to take mine.

166
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Better not to use my drugs.

167
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
They're too strong.
Your friends may go into shock.

168
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Believe me.

169
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,191
Huh?

170
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,191
Son of a bitch!

171
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Eh! You're back at last. My money!

172
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Give me my share quickly. Quickly!

173
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Ai Keng caught me.

174
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
He knew we bet with fake drugs.
He took all the money back.

175
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
What? Don't tease me...

176
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
It's not funny at all.

177
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Muey, look at my face.

178
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,700
Do you think I kicked myself?

179
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Damn!

180
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Oy! Why are you poking me?
I'm still in pain.

181
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,700
Oh, well. How come you got caught?

182
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Forget it!

183
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,700
Do you have 200 baht?

184
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
What!?
You lost all my share and still asking me for my money?

185
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Listen, Muey...

186
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
When I won, you took the money.

187
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Now I've lost, so you must share the loss too.

188
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Ow! You're stupid to get caught,

189
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
and lose the money in your hands.

190
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
So I'm stupid and you're clever!

191
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Ai Keng gave me only 3 days.

192
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,200
If I don't pay back his loan he'll hit me. Hit me!

193
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,191
Ai Hum Lae?

194
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Is it really you, Ai Hum Lae?

195
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Hi.

196
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,700
Er... Muay, is he your friend? Your friend?

197
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
How could he be my friend?

198
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
He is calling you, isn't he?

199
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Do you know him?

200
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Remember me?
I'm Bak Tim from Ban Nong Pradoo.

201
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Hey! Fool! I don't know you.

202
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Fool! Understand!
I've just told you I don't know you!

203
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,200
But I know you, Ai Hum Lae.

204
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Hum Lae? Hum what!?

205
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
What a stupid name! Hum Lae!

206
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Bad luck! I warn you... you're fool.

207
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Ow! No need to lie! Ai Hum Lae... Oops...

208
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Sorry! Slip of my tongue.

209
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Mind your own business.

210
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Get out of my sight! Out!

211
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Okay. You said you were from... Ban? Which?

212
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Ban Nong Pradoo.

213
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,191
That's it. Ban Nong Pradoo.

214
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Okay, I'm leaving.

215
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
So you're both from Ban Nong Pradoo.
You can have a good chat!

216
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Very funny! You've made your point!

217
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Go! Go away! But give me the money first.

218
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,191
Here! For your medicine.

219
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm going now, Ai Hum Lae.

220
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Listen, peasant!
You should return to your hometown.

221
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,191
Go!

222
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Ai Hum Lae, I have to give you a letter.

223
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,193
I told you I don't know you! Get out!

224
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
This is my place.

225
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't be angry with me. Close the door.

226
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Don't let mosquitos in.

227
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,193
I'm in a bad mood and depressed.

228
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,191
Ai Hum Lae...

229
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,193
Our villagers are in serious trouble...

230
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
because Bak Don stole the head of Ong-Bak.

231
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,200
The Chief sent me here to see you,

232
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
so you can help me to find Ong-Bak.

233
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I have Bak Don's address.

234
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,200
No need to talk yet,
and put your things down here.

235
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
You better have a wash first.

236
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Go. Go now!

237
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Here. Here is the washroom.

238
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Go in.

239
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,700
I don't have any other clothing.

240
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,200
Don't worry I'll give you my towel.
Go in. Go!

241
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,200
I'll turn on the light for you.

242
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Soap is on your left, toothbrush on your right.

243
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Mind the slippery floor.

244
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,191
Hello! Muay!

245
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,191
I'll meet you at the stadium...

246
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,191
the boxing stadium. Okay.

247
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Do you still accept the bet?

248
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Do I have time?

249
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,191
Yes.

250
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,191
Here! All of them!

251
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,191
Do you have the amulet?

252
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
The chief changed his mind and didn't want to sell, Boss.

253
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
But I have the head of Ong-Bak, Boss.

254
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
This is the most holy thing in the village...

255
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,193
The thing that they all worship, and the most valuable.

256
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
This broken head...

257
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,191
Why did you bring it to me?

258
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm not interested. Take it away!

259
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
My head is hurting enough without...

260
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,293
you spoiling my mood.

261
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,700
Today, Captain seems to have little to please him.

262
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Look at your fighter, Pearl Harbour.

263
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,700
I think he's losing to Arun, my fighter,
with his Kamikaze technique.

264
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,191
Defeat's certain!

265
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I don't have the money yet...
still trying to get some.

266
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm not asking for money.
I can find that myself.

267
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,500
Now you're selling drugs too!

268
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Yes.

269
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,700
My fighter will win the next competition.

270
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,200
If you think you will win,
then why not increase your bet?

271
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Any sum you like!

272
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
You need not preach to me.

273
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
You don't really understand me.

274
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Just because of one stinking male...

275
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,200
you turn yourself into this low-life.

276
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Muay! You're not my mom!

277
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,800
Because we have no parents,
you've become this bad.

278
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,193
Yes, a bad person like me,
who has brought you up until now.

279
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,300
From now on,
a good person like you should leave me alone.

280
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,293
Yes, tell me whenever you want it.

281
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,191
Strike, strike.

282
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,191
Knock out.

283
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,191
Get up and hit back.

284
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,191
Yesss...

285
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
The next one is coming.

286
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Tell me if you still want to bet.

287
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,191
The winner is... Pearl Harbour.

288
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Damn!

289
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,191
Pearl Habour is the Number One.

290
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Two wins two minutes.
Two wins two minutes.

291
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Where are all my things?

292
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
What?

293
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
My money bag. Where is it?

294
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I don't know. I didn't take it.

295
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,191
Him.

296
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Two and one...

297
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,191
Oh! A fresh challenger.

298
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,193
Taking bets now, taking bets now.

299
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Aw... How come that peasant is in the fighting ring?

300
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,193
Yeh... Ai Tim is surely dead.

301
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
I'll give you 10 to 1.

302
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
But you'd better not dare to bet.

303
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,193
Okay.
I'll bet one million, if you'll dare to accept it.

304
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I accept.

305
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm not here to box. I want the money.

306
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,193
Calm down, I'll give you the money later.
Start!

307
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
We have a new champion tonight.

308
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
What's your name?

309
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Tim from Ban Nong Pradoo.

310
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,191
Tim Pradoo Prew!

311
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,193
Prize for the winner!

312
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I don't want it.
I only want my money bag, there.

313
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,191
What an idiot!

314
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Hey! Hey! Why don't you take the prize money?
Why are you so stupid?

315
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Tell me if you want to fight again.

316
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
You have the skill to win.

317
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I can see lots of money... lots and lots.

318
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
You ask me to fight for money.

319
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Ai Hum Lae...

320
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Why did you steal the villagers' money
to play gambling?

321
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
For the investment...

322
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,193
To get enough money to help you find Ong-Bak.

323
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,200
- You really want to help me?
- Yes.

324
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
This is Don's address.
Could you take me there?

325
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Keep it. I'll take you there later.

326
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Now could you give me some money.

327
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Give me... for the investment.

328
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
When I make a profit, I will pay you back...

329
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
and I'll go anywhere you want.

330
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,293
Absolutely sure!

331
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Go! Go away! Damn you!

332
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Peasant! Can't talk to you, stupid!

333
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Huh! Where will he sleep tonight?

334
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
I don't care! Or he can sleep with you!

335
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,191
You're crazy!

336
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
What shall I do? Ai Keng will kill me.

337
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Muay! Take these drugs to sell in Yai Lao's den.

338
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
When we have enough money,
I will pay you back.

339
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm sure to earn money.
I know this place well.

340
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
After the last one,
you still haven't learnt anything.

341
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I told you before,
I don't want to sell drugs.

342
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
You must help me out.
I don't want to be hit again.

343
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,200
Okay?

344
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Yeah. Yeah... I will try.
But it'll have to be tomorrow.

345
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,093
Okay. Now I feel much better.

346
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
You don't have to look so happy.

347
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,200
From the takings,
you'll get 30, but I'll get 70.

348
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Muay! 50/50.

349
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,700
70/30.

350
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,200
50/50.

351
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
70/30.

352
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
The money you asked for starting your business in Bangkok...

353
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I don't have it.

354
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Because we had a very dry season,

355
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
and Ong-Bak's head was stolen by Ai Don.

356
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Dad wishes that you help Bak Tim
to find and return Ong-Bak to us...

357
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
and save us from disaster.

358
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,191
What nonsense!

359
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,193
Warn! The pool is dry.
Where are we going to find drinking water?

360
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,033
I pray to have Ong-Bak back with us soon, please.

361
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,193
Ai Rung, are you alone?

362
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,191
Ai Piew, are you betting?

363
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Brother, I'm here.

364
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Damn Ai Yod.
Where have you been for months?

365
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
I had to see my friends.

366
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
You are fully aware that I'm short of staff!

367
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Assist me first. Hurry!

368
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Not now. I have to meet a friend.

369
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Don't make an excuse. Help me now.

370
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Not today. Some other day.

371
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
No, now. Quickly!

372
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,791
Take it.

373
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,191
Go away. You deal cards badly.

374
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Put down your bets now.

375
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,193
At your age you should stay at home,
looking after your children.

376
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
What are you looking at? Get out!

377
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
Go to that desk...

378
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
And change your hair colour, too.

379
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,193
The colour that suits me,
and you have to copy it.

380
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,191
Put down your bets... to lose, to lose.

381
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Betting and losing is not my fault.

382
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Turn the cards.
19 and 19 both hands.

383
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Pay the money.

384
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,191
More bets down. Bet, bet.

385
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Here's mine.

386
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Do you have money?

387
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Here it is. 3,000 real money.

388
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
You want to play? You will lose...

389
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
all your money and your belongings.

390
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
- I bet 200.
- Okay, 200.

391
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,191
No card swapping.

392
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,191
Oh! 18 points.

393
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,700
- Pay the money.
- Wait... mine is 19. Pay me!

394
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,191
This is 400.

395
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,200
- Ai has only 6 points, 1 card.
- Mine is 9.

396
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,700
- 8 points 3 cards.
- 9 points.

397
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
What sort of cards are these?

398
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,191
She's lucky.

399
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,200
- It's luck. Good luck.
- 9 points.

400
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
- 8 points again.
- 9 points again.

401
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,193
Damn cards, take it.

402
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
8 points again.

403
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,193
Got you. Pay!

404
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
- Damn! 8 points again.
- 9 to beat you.

405
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
These cards are impossible.

406
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I must check if she is cheating.

407
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,200
She got all 9 points for 15 games.
Took most of my money.

408
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,191
Why do you pay her?

409
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,200
I want to see if you will get 9 again.

410
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,191
You're cheating me, bitch!

411
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,193
I know I got 8 without turning the cards.

412
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Points? If 9...

413
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,191
I'm certain that you cheat.

414
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Look! Loser! She got 4 points.

415
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
I don't believe it.

416
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm sure that she concealed some cards.
I want to search her.

417
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Wait... Calm down!

418
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
You should search her.

419
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Hey! Do you hide some cards?

420
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
- No, I don't.
- Let's see.

421
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
There are none, I told you.

422
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Any hidden in your bag?

423
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Let me check her myself.

424
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Don't trouble yourself.

425
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Come here!
Okay, you can go.

426
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
You've got to search her everywhere.

427
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
All done, everywhere. You can go. Go now!

428
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Don't come back here again, bitch!

429
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Winning every game like that is bad for my place.

430
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Let's continue. We can beat these people.

431
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
No point to win, they're all broke.
Broke! Broke!

432
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
She won all their money. Nothing left.

433
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,700
Don't you have a go at me.

434
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,200
Total 8,000. I give your 3,000 back.

435
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Why is it only 3,000?

436
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
You won't need so much anyway.

437
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
What? No profit for me at all.

438
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Er... You take this money first.

439
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Don't spend too much.

440
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Give me another 1,000.

441
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
3,000 is enough for you.

442
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
This will merely cover my college fees.

443
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Hey! Seem to have a lot of money.

444
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,191
That guy is here.

445
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Lend me your money.

446
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
- This is my money.
- Er... I'll pay you back.

447
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Will pay you back.

448
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Hi! I was on my way to pay you,
but you beat me to it. Here!

449
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
That is my money.

450
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,191
What?

451
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
8,000. I'll give you the rest later.

452
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Don't look at me so menacingly.

453
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
I'm not bothered too much about the rest of the money.

454
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,193
But when you two try to cheat me,
I can't forget!

455
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,193
- Hold him! Beat him!
- No, I won't fight you.

456
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,191
Ai Tim! Ai Tim!

457
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,191
- I won't fight. I won't fight.
- Help! Help!

458
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,200
You cheated me, here!

459
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
You want trouble?

460
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,191
Here's some!

461
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,191
Will be seeing you!

462
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I have to thank you, Ai Tim.

463
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,193
And I will help you to find Ong-Bak.

464
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Could you fight one more time?

465
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Wait... Listen to me first.

466
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,200
You saw just a minute ago. They beat me.

467
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
If I don't pay them, they will kill me.

468
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Could you help me?

469
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
One last fight for me.

470
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Okay. It doesn't matter anyway.
Stupid peasant!

471
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,193
Stupid village, stupid villagers!
Relying on only one boxer...

472
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,200
to find and return Ong-Bak to their village.
Are you crazy?

473
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,200
If Ong-Bak is so powerful,
why let a thief cut his head off?

474
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,193
It's only made from pieces of stone and earth.

475
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Box me! Why box me?

476
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,100
You are from the same village.
Don't kill each other.

477
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
He boxed me!

478
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,803
Never mind that! There!
The people you want to kill are over there!

479
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,700
Ai Peng! Haven't you had enough?

480
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,500
You want a kick to send you to sleep?

481
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,100
Umm... You have too many.

482
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,493
Ai Yod. You know very well what to do.

483
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,193
Muay. You know what to do.

484
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,623
Use your individual skills.

485
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Don't leave me.

486
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,191
After them!

487
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,193
Follow them. I'll go to block the other way.

488
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
- You!
- I'm going!

489
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,191
Get out, get out!

490
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,191
Oh! How can he pass?

491
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,393
Ooh! Is my bum still okay?
I don't know how I crossed them.

492
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Let me borrow the chopper quick.

493
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,193
Come near me and I will slaughter you.

494
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,093
Knives! Knives!
Big ones, small ones for sale.

495
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,191
"Chilli Powder"

496
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,191
Get him! Kill him!

497
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Ai Tim! Help me!

498
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
I won't help.
You have to fight them yourself.

499
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Ai Don! Yes, I know his address. I'll take you.

500
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,093
Ai Tim! I know where Ai Don is.

501
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,193
Who's next!?

502
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
I used to see Ai Don hanging around here,
selling drugs.

503
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,400
Ask Muay, if you don't believe me...

504
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,193
But today...

505
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,193
That boy is here, Boss.

506
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Bring him here to fight until the stakes are high...

507
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
then I will get rid of him.

508
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,193
Depends on how brave you are to take a bet.

509
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,191
Hey! You! Aw!

510
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,191
You are a maniac!

511
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,193
Champion! New champion!
Tim Pradoo Prew!

512
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Come on! Come and fight me! Come on!

513
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,200
What are you waiting for?
Let's go, you hear! Come on!

514
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,193
What? You're scared? Let's go!
Come on. What are you waiting for?

515
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
What's the matter, Yod?

516
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Ai Big Bear is challenging Ai Tim to a fight.

517
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Come on! Thai boxing has had its day.
You should try freestyle.

518
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,200
You lot I'll fix next.
Thai people are not strong enough.

519
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,200
That's why Thai people come to my country to look at it.

520
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,893
Come on! I'll show you.

521
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,193
Come on! I'll fight you!
I'll teach you Thai boxing! Come on!

522
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,191
Fuck you!

523
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,193
Come on! You want to fight me now. Fight me!

524
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
Have you seen Bak Don?

525
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
No, but I've seen a Thai man being beaten.

526
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,191
You are a coward.

527
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,191
Come on!

528
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,193
Are you going to help him?
Without help he'll die.

529
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,191
Come on! Come on!

530
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,191
- Ai Tim!
- Come on!

531
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,700
If I knew you were like this,
I wouldn't have helped you to find Ong-Bak.

532
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:09,193
Huh! You can do that later.
But now you must help him first.

533
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,191
I'll kill him.

534
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,191
No!

535
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,093
