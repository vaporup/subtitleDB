1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,900
Too much for you? Give up?

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,400
Ay! Let go of me!

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
Ay! Let me go!

4
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,900
You've disappointed me.

5
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:42,400
Good! The best! I told you, Muay,
to bet on him. We're rich! Rich!!

6
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Muay! Pick up the coins!

7
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,400
Enough for today!
You won't get your money back.

8
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,700
Ai Tim! You are so good, we have
a great opportunity to get rich.

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,200
Brilliant!

10
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,500
Ai Don!

11
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,100
Follow them!

12
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,900
Music!

13
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,000
Get them!

14
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,000
Quick! Let's go!

15
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Ai Don!

16
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,000
Follow them.

17
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
This week I have to see customers.

18
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
I want you to get things ready.

19
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Tell me first if there is a problem.

20
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Yes Boss.

21
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,200
I want you to report everything.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,200
Ai Hum Lae!
Where will we find Ai Bak Don?

23
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,700
You eat your food first. Eat!

24
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
Don't worry.

25
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,900
I'll find him! At the rice mill,
everyone knows him well.

26
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Eat!

27
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Muay! Tomorrow you'll go with me.

28
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,900
May be some chance to get money.

29
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
I can't. Exams tomorrow.

30
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Exams! I've never seen you attend class.

31
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,000
How can you pass? Do you have
something special with the teacher?

32
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
What!
A joke, a joke.

33
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,000
You're a good student, you're clever.
Eat...

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,100
Thanks a lot for helping me to find Ong Bak.

35
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't thank me.

36
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Ai Yod, you owe me 3 months rent.

37
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you going to do?

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,100
Er... Give me 3 days.

39
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,900
I'll pay you. This time for sure.

40
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
You said 'sure' too many times already.

41
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,100
I want money today -
otherwise you must move out.

42
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,100
Will you accept this ring instead?

43
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
OK

44
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,900
You must pay the rent within 7 days.

45
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
If you have no money again,

46
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll kick you out, understand?

47
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,900
Son, I want you to return home with Bak Tim.

48
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Don't worry if you don't have enough money.

49
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,900
I don't mind if you don't want to become a monk.

50
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,900
I only want you to visit us.

51
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,000
I miss you, son.

52
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,000
What's the matter!
Am I not as good as your ex-husband?

53
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
You spoil my mood.

54
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,400
Don!

55
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't want to sell drugs any more.

56
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
Why?

57
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,700
I want to stop.

58
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,600
You want to stop?

59
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,000
Really want to stop?
Come here!

60
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,900
You think you can stop that easily.

61
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,000
You think you can, but you can't.

62
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,000
Who?

63
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,000
Huh! Ai Don.

64
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,000
Pi Ngek, Pi Ngek, Pi Ngek, Pi Ngek.

65
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
Where is Ong Bak?
I don't know.

66
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,900
You brought it here!
I don't know.

67
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
Ai Tim.

68
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,000
Get away.

69
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,000
Pi Ngek!

70
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,000
Get out quickly, Don.

71
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Go, Go.

72
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,200
Call an ambulance for Room 212.
She's dying. Urgent!

73
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,000
Ai Tim! Come here quickly in a Tuk Tuk.

74
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,000
Hurry up.

75
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,000
You're dead.

76
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,000
Keep following me!

77
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
Come! You're dead.

78
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,000
Huh! Ai Tim.

79
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,000
Ai Tim! Brake! Brake! Brake quickly!

80
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh Bhudda! Oh!

81
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,100
Spread them out.

82
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh! Damn!

83
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,000
Get out!

84
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,200
You're dead.

85
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Remember! You must search every
square metre. Don't miss anything.

86
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,000
Most important, you must not
allow any strangers in. Understand?

87
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,000
Damn them! They keep chasing after me.

88
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,000
Get in.

89
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,000
Today the Police and
National Heritage have found...

90
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
lots of Buddha statues and relics
on the Chao Praya river's bank

91
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,900
This finding of invaluable objects
is very significant.

92
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,000
Because every piece is a national treasure.

93
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,000
National Heritage is making a catalogue
for protective conservation.

94
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We will report any developments to this story.

95
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,900
I told you not to cause trouble.

96
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,000
I didn't. They are looking for Ong Bak.

97
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,000
What's Ong Bak?

98
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
The head of the Buddha Statue that I brought to you.

99
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Why does this man cause me so much trouble?

100
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
I lost my betting money,

101
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
and all my relics collection...

102
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,200
because of one peasant.

103
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry I can't save her.

104
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,000
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek. Pi Ngek!

105
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Pi Ngek don't leave me.

106
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,000
Who's she?

107
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Muay's big sister.

108
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,000
You cann't leave me.
I have nobody.

109
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,000
Muay, Muay.

110
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,000
Ngek asked me to give this to you...

111
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
'For Muay College Fees'

112
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't want it, don't want it

113
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,900
I want you. I have nobody else.

114
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,000
You can't leave. I've no one else.

115
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Don't be so sad, Muay.

116
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,000
Birth and death are part of life.

117
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,100
I won't leave you.

118
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,900
What's this? What?

119
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Where are you taking me?

120
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Let's go, go quickly.
Go, go!

121
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Do you know who I am?

122
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,000
How dare you attack my property!

123
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,900
I don't know. It's between Ai Tim and Ai Don.

124
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,000
True! I don't know.

125
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,000
I know that you are looking for this Head.

126
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,000
Do you really want it?

127
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,000
If you want it. I've a game for you to play.

128
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
I saw Ong Bak with my own eyes.

129
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,900
If you accept to fight for him,

130
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,000
he will give you Ong Bak and release Muay.

131
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,000
What are you going to do?
Tell me.

132
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,000
I will do anything...

133
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,900
to bring back Ong Bak to Ban Nong Pradoo.

134
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll sacrify even with my life.

135
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why do you call me to leave the frontier?

136
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,000
To warn you to stay away from political
issues and I want you to make a bet.

137
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Oho. You want to revenge that
country boxer to death!

138
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,000
How much you want to bet? Your call.

139
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,700
You don't call the shots anymore!

140
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,000
On the East corner is a Thai Boxer.
He's new to us.

141
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:26,000
The Burmese Boxer is on the West corner.
He's one of the best.

142
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:36,000
Now the fight has begun.

143
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,700
Ai Tim! Ai Tim! Are you OK?
Enough.

144
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hey! If you want Ong Bak, follow me.

145
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,200
You're crooks too.
Tim lost the fight so I could win the bet.

146
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
Huh! This is Pra.

147
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,200
It's just the head of some worthless
statue that you're trying to get.

148
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,800
I'm not interested in the head,
I just want you to box for me.

149
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,200
Don't dare challenge me because
I can make you live or die.

150
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Damn you! You betray us.

151
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,200
Ai Tim lost the fight for you,
why don't you return the head to him?

152
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,800
Son of a bitch!

153
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,800
Calm down.
Finish them after I've gone.

154
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,700
You got hurt but I got the money.
Remember that I ordered this.

155
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,800
Get rid of them.
I can't help if they don't listen.

156
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,700
Huh! Kill them!

157
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
Pi Yod!

158
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,200
Damn! I told him not to make a noise.

159
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
Hey! Do it quickly!
Police may be here soon.

160
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,800
Hey! Go there.

161
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,800
Where is Ong Bak?

162
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,800
Hey! I go with you.
No, I can't let anyone die for Ong Bak.

163
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,800
Except me, only me.

164
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,800
Ai Tim, Ai Tim.

165
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,200
Let me help you.

166
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I don't want to be like this.
I apologise to you.

167
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,800
Let me do one good deed
for Ban Nong Pradoo.

168
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,700
At least... Let me start the bike for you.

169
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,200
I, Bak Hum Lae, from Ban Nong Pradoo.

170
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,900
Don told me there is a secret cave
behind the next mountain.

171
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,700
Still not dead!

172
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,700
You want Ong Bak!
You have to exchange it with your life.

173
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
We're cutting the biggest head.

174
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,000
Ai Tim! Ai Tim... Ai Ti...

175
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,200
Ai Ham Lae! Are you OK?

176
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,200
Go and get Ong Bak. Go!

177
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,700
Don't worry about me.
Go and get Ong Bak.

178
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,200
Go!
