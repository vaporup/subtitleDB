1
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,191
- Have you fallen asleep?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

2
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,569
I think you must be in love or something.

3
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,283
Why does the old bitch pick on me?

4
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,371
That's the second time this week. 
I nearly told her what she could do with the job.

5
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,999
Hey, you asleep?

6
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,001
That's what I asked her.

7
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,754
She wants me to stay till 7:00 again.

8
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,187
What polish are you putting on?

9
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,982
- The usual one, madame.
- Oh, I'm fed up with it.

10
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,318
I feel like a change.

11
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,489
- Uh, give me Revlon's <i>Fire and Ice</i>.
- Oh, I'll go and get it.

12
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,055
Madame Denise?

13
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,143
Madame Denise,
Mrs. Rendlesham wants Revlon <i>Fire and Ice</i>.

14
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,313
I don't think there's any left.

15
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,991
Put this on.
She'll never know the difference.

16
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,209
Hello, darling.
How about a bit of the other, then?

17
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,355
You can't eat stuff like this.

18
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,233
Come on.
I'll take you to <i>Wheeler's</i>. Okay?

19
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,445
I have to get back.

20
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,906
Oh, we can have a —
we can have a quick meal.

21
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,785
Come on.

22
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,207
I can't. I`ll be late.

23
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,960
Well, just —just one thing.

24
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,045
No?

25
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,133
I can't.

26
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,152
Well, good-bye.

27
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,196
Well, just a —just a minute.
What about tonight?

28
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,741
I'm sorry, but I'm busy tonight.

29
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,245
You really make me feel wanted.

30
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,414
Who's the lucky boy?

31
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,292
I'm having dinner with my sister.

32
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,794
Is she a good cook?

33
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,505
I don't know. I never thought about it.

34
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,801
Well, at least it can't be
any worse than fish and chips.

35
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,432
I think we are having rabbit.

36
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,601
Rabbit? Oh.

37
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,020
I thought they'd all been killed off.

38
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,566
- No. She has a friend —
- A rabbit?

39
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,860
No, I think the friend has rabbits.

40
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,864
Poor bunny.
Well, what about tomorrow?

41
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,868
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah. Let's have dinner tomorrow.

42
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,538
I'll meet you at the <i>Hoop and Toy</i>.
You know, the pub along there.

43
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,458
About, uh, 7:00?

44
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,538
- Hello.
- Hello.

45
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,666
Come along boy. Walkies. Walkies.

46
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,918
<i>Walkies.</i> 

47
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,121
Have a good day?

48
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,791
- Darling?
- Yes.

49
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,396
- How was work?
- All right.

50
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,442
It's close today.

51
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,529
- Are you still going away?
- Oh, darling, please don't start that again.

52
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,785
- How long are you going for?
- I've told you.

53
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,828
- Fortnight?
- Mind.

54
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,290
How long?

55
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,794
Ten or 12 days.

56
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,879
No more than that?

57
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,886
I heard such a funny story
on the news this evening.

58
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,931
Does he have to leave his things
in the bathroom?

59
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,934
The minister of health—
What's his name?

60
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,353
He found eels coming out of his sink.

61
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,481
It was on the television.
Even the announcer was laughing.

62
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,234
Why does he put his toothbrush in my glass?

63
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,739
Carol, please.

64
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,839
We must get this crack mended.

65
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,591
What?

66
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,187
- Hello.
- Hello.

67
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,524
You're early.
I didn't expect you for hours.

68
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,860
I couldn't live without you
for another minute.

69
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,030
Idiot. Anyway, you said 8:30.
I haven't even started yet.

70
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,199
There's a marvelous story
in this evening's paper.

71
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,202
- It takes at least one hour.
- Huh?

72
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,455
Your rabbit.
I'm cooking it.

73
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:33,543
Look. "Bring to the boil. Skim and allow 
to simmer slowly for one and a half hours."

74
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,171
Yes. Well, we'll eat out tonight.
I'll take you out.

75
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,257
Here. Look. Read that.

76
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,219
Oh, I know that.
I saw it on television.

77
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,389
That bloody bell.

78
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,935
Eels.

79
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,021
Pity it wasn't lobster though.

80
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,567
You never give me a chance
to show you what a good cook I am.

81
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,695
Well, you can tell me over dinner.

82
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,240
You'd think they'd have something better to do 
than clang away like that all the time.

83
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,744
Hmm. It's worse when they start 
doing it at midnight.

84
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,414
I wonder what they ring it for anyway.
Perhaps they have wild parties.

85
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,918
Maybe they'll invite me sometime.

86
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,507
Go and put your best bib and tucker on.
I feel like a spree.

87
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,928
Ah.

88
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,555
The beautiful younger sister.

89
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,641
Comment ca va?

90
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,025
I thought you were eating in.

91
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,572
Aren't you going to have dinner?

92
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,202
Yes. I'm going to have dinner.

93
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,832
- But not here.
- No.

94
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,917
Not here.

95
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,256
Pass me that brush, will you?
There's a love.

96
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,639
Just because I go out once,
there's no need to start sulking.

97
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,518
- I'm not sulking.
- Hmm. Well, you're not exactly smiling.

98
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,814
Come on. You're not going in
for the Miss World competition.

99
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,111
Will we go and see
the Leaning Tower of Pisa?

100
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,196
I don't think Cinderella likes me.

101
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,198
- Cinderella?
- The little sister.

102
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,617
Ah, don't be silly. 

103
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,078
Well, are we going to see
the Leaning Tower of Pisa?

104
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,247
She's a bit strung-up, isn't she?

105
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,750
She's just sensitive. That's all.

106
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,879
You can say that again.
She should see a doctor.

107
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,798
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

108
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,467
- No. You tell me what you meant by that.
- Nothing. Let's forget it.

109
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,088
You want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
we'll see the bloody thing. Now let's relax.

110
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:50,517
We're going to dinner aren't we? 

111
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,600
Don't always change the subject 
when you start talking like that. You hear? 

112
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,400
<i>Come along, boy. Din-din.</i> 

113
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,778
<i>Time for din-din.</i> 

114
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,280
Come along, boy. Lovely din-din.

115
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,978
<i>Oh, come —</i>  

116
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,989
<i>Oh!</i> 

117
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,625
<i>Mmm.</i> 

118
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,864
I'm sorry.

119
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,690
Oh, look. I've got to run.
I've left something at the flat.

120
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,733
Well, aren't you going to drop me off?

121
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,777
I've got no time.

122
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,531
Mmm. That's bloody hot.
Now you —you'll have to take a cab.

123
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,617
Uh, here.

124
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,080
Oh, here. Are you —
Am I gonna see you tonight?

125
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,082
Um —

126
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,084
I-I'll ring you, hmm?

127
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,169
I'll ring you.

128
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,736
Hello, darling.
How did you sleep?

129
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,238
All right.

130
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,991
Is he going to stay here every night?

131
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,379
I really don't think it's any concern of yours.

132
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:26,052
He's married though.

133
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:32,391
Darling, it's my affair.

134
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,691
We all have to lead
our own lives in the end, you know.

135
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,822
Well, just don't stand around like that.
Go and answer the phone.

136
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,908
Can't you see I'm busy?

137
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,208
- Hello?
- <i>Miss Ledoux?</i>

138
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,292
Yes.

139
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,003
<i>How much longer are you going 
to keep me waiting for the rent?</i>

140
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,090
Oh. You want my sister.

141
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,343
- <i>Ah. I suppose she's out.</i>
- No, no. She's here.

142
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,637
Just a moment.

143
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,807
- Who is it?
- The landlord.

144
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,476
Oh, damn. He would ring up today.

145
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,689
- Hello, yes?
- <i>Miss Ledoux?</i>

146
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,442
- Look. I'm terribly sorry —
- <i>I bet you are.</i>

147
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,362
- <i>Now look. How much longer are you going to keep me waiting?</i>
- I promise —

148
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,533
- <i>I've had your promises before.</i>
- I promise you'll have the money tomorrow.

149
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,369
<i>That's what you said a fortnight ago.</i>

150
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,371
You'll have the money tomorrow without fail.

151
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,916
- <i>Look. If you're not going to play fair by —</i>
- My sister will bring it round to you.

152
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,001
- <i>Not you?</i>
- N-No.

153
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,003
I'm going away on holiday.

154
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,714
<i>Now look Miss Ledoux.
This time I've had just about —</i>

155
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,842
She'll bring it round to you tomorrow.
I promise.

156
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,052
<i>She better, Miss Ledoux.
That's all I can say.</i>

157
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,475
Just the sound of his voice makes my flesh creep.

158
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,145
Money, money, money.
That's all he ever thinks about.

159
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,190
Good heavens.
I shall be late again.

160
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,022
- Is Bridget about?
- Oh, she's downstairs.

161
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,107
Oh.

162
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,119
Bridget.

163
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,580
What's the matter?

164
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,416
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

165
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,502
Nothing.

166
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,966
Just bloody men.
Promise you the earth, and then —

167
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,387
- Oh, I could cut my throat.
- Don't talk like that.

168
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,395
I thought this one was different.

169
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,274
- Did he —
- Oh, he was a pig. Forget him.

170
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,652
Oh. Look at my eyes.

171
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,946
<i>Will Miss Bridget please come to the salon.</i> 

172
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,782
<i>Mrs. Prendergast has arrived.</i>

173
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,827
I'll tell you the sordid details later.

174
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,748
Oh, why are they so filthy?

175
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,711
Don't be upset.

176
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,964
<i>Will Miss Bridget please come 
to the salon right away.</i> 

177
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,553
- Cheerio then.
- See you later.

178
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,031
- You're joking.
- No. You should have seen them.

179
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,034
They went for each other 
like those women wrestlers in Hamburg.

180
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,329
One, a big lady with bloody great charlies,
tried to claw the other girl's face.

181
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,541
Got her fist right down her throat.
Two pints of bitter, please.

182
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,376
- Two pints sir?
- Lesbians?

183
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,713
Now no. They both fancied the same bloke.
I should have his luck. 

184
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,466
And then they started in with their teeth,
rolling about on the floor.

185
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,428
It was like a madhouse. 
And I was the only mug who tried to prevent them.

186
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,555
I ought to have my head examined.

187
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,849
I wouldn't have minded seeing it.

188
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,559
Feel free, anytime.

189
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,728
- I ended up —
- Thank you.

190
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,105
my coat torn,
my shirt covered with blood.

191
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,900
If you like that sort of thing,
I'll introduce you to my cousin.

192
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,444
- She's a black belt.
- Black belt?

193
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,491
How did you get on?

194
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,744
- What?
- What's your cousin like?

195
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:52,414
- Well, how did you get on with Little Miss Muffet?
- She sounds fun.

196
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,918
- When?
- Well, I thought you were taking her out to dinner.

197
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,544
Your cousin — what's she like?

198
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,671
Is that the right time?

199
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,383
- Now sir.
- Oh, come on. Fill us in with the gripping details.

200
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,179
The gripping details are
that she had dinner with her sister.

201
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,641
Well, maybe you should try the sister.

202
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,299
Are you playing hard to get?

203
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,301
I've been waiting over an hour.

204
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,387
Wh — What for?

205
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,807
Well, not for Christmas.

206
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,227
We made a date. Remember?
We're having supper tonight.

207
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,396
Oh, I forgot.

208
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,899
Oh.

209
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,656
Well, next time you forget,
maybe you'll let me know.

210
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,741
It's not that but —

211
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,832
Are you all right?

212
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,876
You look —

213
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,753
I don't know.
You look sort of— sort of funny.

214
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,007
I don't feel —

215
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,093
I mean, I don't know.

216
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,515
Oh well, anyway come on. Now I've found you, let's — 
let's go and eat something.

217
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,518
- I'm starving.
- But it's too late.

218
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,357
Look. Have — 
Have you been fired or something?

219
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,532
All right. Come on.
I'll take you home. Come on.

220
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,243
Listen, Carol. I — I —

221
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,704
- I don't —
- Clumsy bitch!

222
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,706
For heaven's sake.

223
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,916
Carol!

224
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,918
Carol!

225
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,070
<i>Dean doing a little illegal bit 
outside the ring...</i>

226
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,072
<i>but a neat head butt there by Larsen...</i>

227
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,199
<i>and over to the corner
with Ray Hunter coming in.</i>

228
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,367
<i>Finally Rebel Ray Hunter comes in
after Stedman the giant.</i>

229
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,871
<i>And Hunter turning Stedman
all over the place now but he...</i>

230
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,332
<i>still exchanged places with Larsen.</i>

231
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,503
<i>And Larsen again for Hunter. 
And now it's Hunter in again against Stedman.</i>

232
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,922
<i>Hunter really throwing Stedman around.
I don't know why he goes out.</i>

233
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,966
<i>And it's Larsen in again. Larsen comes in
with a twopenny drop. He's gonna need one.</i>

234
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,968
<i>Stedman almost into the ropes there.</i>

235
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,641
Darling.

236
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,310
What is it?

237
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:12,442
Don't you feel well?

238
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,988
Oh I know you don't
want me to go away but —

239
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,253
Hello?

240
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:39,010
Hello?

241
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,181
<i>But the first point to Hunter and Larsen.</i>

242
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,896
<i>Fourteen and a half minutes gone.</i>

243
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,865
<i>Mmm.</i>

244
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,716
Why'd you throw Michael's things away?

245
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,348
- Why'd you do it?
- I don't like them there.

246
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,685
It's got absolutely nothing to do with you.

247
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,688
You silly little fool.

248
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,701
I've put the money for the rent
on the table.

249
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,626
Oh, please. Don't go.

250
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,628
Now please,
don't forget to give the money...

251
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,672
otherwise we shall both be out onto the street.

252
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,592
- Look. Are you coming or aren't you?
- Yes, yes. I'm coming.

253
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,723
Don't look so sad.

254
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,267
The time will pass very quickly.

255
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,109
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

256
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,528
Go on.

257
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,681
Oh!

258
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,642
- You're killing me!
- Sorry, Miss Balch.

259
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,479
- There's only —
- Good morning.

260
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,316
Good morning.
There's only one way to deal with men.

261
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,445
That's treat them as though
you don't give a damn about them.

262
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,072
I've told you all this before.

263
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,867
Still, I'm glad to see
you have listened to me just this once.

264
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,994
There's only one thing they want,
and I'll never know...

265
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,788
why they make such a fuss about it,
but they do.

266
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,333
And the more you make them beg for it,
the happier they are.

267
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,587
- He rang me up this morning.
- I said he would.

268
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,259
- He was practically on his knees.
- Well, make sure he stays that way.

269
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,264
I wonder, I don't suppose it would do me any harm 
if I had a little snack.

270
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,433
Well, what do you fancy?

271
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,437
They're all the same, just like children.
They want to be spanked, then given sweets.

272
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,940
Perhaps a...

273
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,942
little Danish pastry.

274
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,612
- Tsk, tsk.
- And a cup of chocolate.

275
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,697
Carol will order it for you.

276
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,034
Carol.

277
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,829
Stop dreaming.

278
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,380
Are you feeling all right, love?

279
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,184
Carol, what's the matter?

280
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,939
There's nothing you'd like to tell me?

281
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,024
I mean, uh —

282
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,569
How do you feel now?

283
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,782
Still biting your nails, eh?

284
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,828
I think you'd better go home. 
Would you like one of the girls to go with you?

285
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,081
Now please. I'll be all right.

286
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,751
Take a taxi anyway.
Uh, ask Millie to give you the money.

287
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,836
Thank you.

288
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,878
Hello? 

289
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,808
Hello?

290
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,775
Hello?

291
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,285
<i>Hello Carol?</i>

292
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,996
<i>It's-It's Colin. H-Hello?</i>

293
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,833
<i>Carol. Carol, it's me.</i>

294
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,963
<i>Carol. Please answer—</i>

295
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,817
I'm running a business here Carol,
not a rest home.

296
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,528
You can't just disappear for three days.

297
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:10,324
Are you sure — 
Well, I mean, you're not in any trouble?

298
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,328
No, I'm not. I'm really —

299
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,747
But surely you could have phoned.

300
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,001
- Well, what is it?
- Mrs. Shaw-Taylor wants to see you.

301
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,879
All right.
I'll be with you in a minute.

302
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:27,633
Carol I can't help you
if you won't tell me what's the matter.

303
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,636
Oh — Well —

304
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:40,354
Well, one of my aunts
came to stay very suddenly.

305
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:44,900
Oh. I was back at work two days
after I had my first baby.

306
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,653
If you're going to vanish
every time a relative appears...

307
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,823
we might just as well
put up the shutters.

308
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,950
I'd better go and see
what that old bitch wants.

309
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,536
Now, you go back to your work.
I`ll talk to you later.

310
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,873
And, Carol?
Do something about your hair.

311
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,917
Yes madame.

312
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,337
- Oh my God. Look, look.
- It's nothing.

313
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,843
Out.

314
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,315
I should have your luck,
getting off early.

315
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,318
Come on. Cheer up.

316
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,282
Don't look so mis.

317
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,581
You know, you really don't look well.

318
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,210
- Is it a man?
- A man?

319
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:30,172
Well, I thought that maybe that smooth boy —
What's his name? Was making you unhappy.

320
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,883
You know, the one I've seen you with.

321
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,885
Are you in love with him?

322
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,596
I'm not in love with anyone.

323
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,974
Well, what were you up to
for the last three days?

324
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,227
Nothing. I stayed at home.

325
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,021
Oh, well. That's enough
to drive anyone up the wall.

326
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,941
You ought to go out,
go to a movie or something.

327
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,402
- Oh I'd love to.
- That's it then. Do it.

328
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,822
We saw such a funny Chaplin film
at the <i>Classic</i> the other night.

329
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,450
What was it called?

330
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,744
I thought I'd die laughing.

331
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,121
He was so hungry,
he wanted to eat his shoe.

332
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,748
- No.
- Yes.

333
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,626
He pretended the laces were spaghetti.

334
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:16,093
There was this huge great big fat man
who wanted to eat him.

335
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,554
- What? Him?
- Yes.

336
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,348
He wanted to eat Charlie Chaplin.

337
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,936
He thought Charlie was a chicken.

338
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,729
- Chicken?
- Yes.

339
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,983
And the chicken walked like Chaplin too.

340
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,985
You know.

341
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,200
Roger laughed so much,
I was quite ashamed of him.

342
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,036
You ought to see it though
to cheer you up.

343
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,361
Still keeping her legs crossed?

344
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,781
She's getting you down, you know.

345
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,534
The old, old story —
"Not before we're married, darling."

346
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,828
I wouldn't waste your money.

347
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,830
She seems a dead loss to me.

348
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,125
I mean, don't let her being foreign fool you. 

349
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,836
They're all the same, these bloody virgins —
They're just teasers, that's all.

350
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,923
She seems to have old Colin
nicely steamed up though.

351
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,925
She gets a big thrill out of it.

352
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,302
You tell her. She'll soon strip off.

353
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,889
- When I want your advice I'll ask for it.
- Ah.

354
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,266
I do believe the old lad's in love.

355
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,019
- What about that then?
- Another good man gone.

356
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:35,315
I think your friends
are going to have to help you.

357
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,614
Why don't you, um take her over
to Reggie's pad one evening? 

358
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,616
Here. Steady on John.

359
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,660
Oh, Reggie will lay something on.
Won't you, Reggie?

360
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,662
Or on something.

361
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,664
I can see the scene now.

362
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,922
Sweet music, soft lights, a big jug of iced gin
with um, orange or lemon on top of it.

363
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,924
- Oranges.
- Why, tell her it's a fruit cup...

364
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,009
and three of the most eligible
bachelors in London.

365
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,011
Here. I`m getting excited already.

366
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,055
By the end of the evening,
she'll be begging for it.

367
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,641
- You'll soon be able to stop twitching.
- She'll weep with gratitude.

368
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,727
Yeah. Maybe we will too.

369
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,439
- Maybe you want your face pushed in.
- Here. Take your hands off me.

370
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,983
Colin for heaven's sake.

371
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,028
Relax. Take a joke.
Hit me or something.

372
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,532
Now, look, boy. You've got it bad. Look.

373
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,285
You see?
He's been in the sun too long.

374
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,370
Look, it was only a joke.

375
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:34,374
There's no need to bloody bust out going on
like Cassius Clay all over the place.

376
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,753
- A joke, boy. Joke.
- Fellas, fellas please.

377
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,839
If you go on like this
you will be old before your time.

378
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:45,385
Look relax, take it easy, enjoy life.

379
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,703
<i>Carol?</i>

380
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,998
<i>Carol!</i>

381
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:29,275
There's somebody there.
I can see your shadow.

382
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,362
<i>What's the matter?
I just want to talk to you that's all.</i>

383
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,117
<i>Carol!</i>

384
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,038
<i>If you don't open the door,
I'll bloody well break it down!</i>

385
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,125
- No!
<i>- What?</i>

386
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:38,928
I'm sorry.

387
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,267
It's all so sordid.

388
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,944
What's — What's the matter?

389
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,824
I'm sorry. I just —

390
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,535
Well, I had to see you, that's all.

391
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,789
Honestly, it's been so —
so miserable without you.

392
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,089
I phoned and phoned.

393
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,341
The ringing tone nearly drove me mad.

394
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,815
Is it, uh — Is it something I've done?

395
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,781
Carol.

396
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,839
Please.

397
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:00,260
Tell me.

398
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,775
I'm not really like this, you know.

399
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,612
Oh.

400
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,781
I wish I could find the proper words to say.

401
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,617
They just keep going round and round
in my head.

402
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:28,204
I — I just —

403
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,044
I want to be — to be with you.

404
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:40,466
All the time.

405
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,328
Hello.

406
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,542
<i>You filthy bitch.</i>

407
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,961
I'm sorry. Who is this?

408
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,713
<i>Who is this? Who is this?</i>

409
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:01,050
<i>Who do you think, you filthy little tart?
You think I don't know he's with you?</i>

410
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:04,220
<i>You think you're clever,
but you're not that clever, you filthy —</i>

411
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,968
Come on! Open up this door.

412
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,650
Come on. Open up.
I know you're in there.

413
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,652
It's no use hiding.

414
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,821
Else I`ll call the police. 

415
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:00,145
Well!

416
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,982
Where's Miss Ledoux?

417
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:05,234
I am Miss Ledoux.

418
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,403
You don't look like her.

419
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:11,156
- I expect you want my sister.
- Expect?

420
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:14,159
I certainly do.

421
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,664
Where is she?

422
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:21,083
She's not — 
But I can explain.

423
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:23,377
Explain?

424
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:26,630
Well, I doubt that, my dear.

425
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,174
I can see it with my own eyes.

426
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:35,639
Now then what's the idea
of barricading the door against me?

427
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:41,687
You're not only late with the rent...

428
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:44,189
but you're damaging the property.

429
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,275
I've got the rent here.

430
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:56,201
Let's have a little light on the subject.

431
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,245
No!

432
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:02,166
I'm not a bloody owl, you know.

433
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,078
Ah, I thought I'd seen everything. 

434
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,748
This is a flaming nuthouse.

435
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,432
I don't know.

436
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,436
Uh, do you always, uh...

437
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,272
run around like, uh, this?

438
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,733
I mean to say, it's a bit, uh —

439
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,621
What's the matter?

440
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,707
You ill?

441
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,502
Ah.

442
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:31,255
The, uh, heat's getting you down, hmm?

443
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,008
Uh, I don't like it myself.

444
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:40,639
I'll, uh — I'll get you a — a glass of water.

445
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,518
You're white as a sheet.

446
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,938
Hmm.

447
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:53,944
What the hell is this?

448
01:23:56,406 --> 01:24:00,951
Oh. No wonder you look ill,
if you have things like this hanging around.

449
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,623
It's the dustbin for you my lad.

450
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,517
Good Lord.

451
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:33,609
Beats me how you young people live in such a mess.

452
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:37,196
It's like a pigsty. Huh.

453
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:57,382
Ah.

454
01:24:57,467 --> 01:25:00,260
I know. Ah.

455
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:04,306
A nice, hot cup of tea
might be better, perhaps, hmm?

456
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:13,232
Of course, um,
your sister's gone away, hasn't she?

457
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:19,238
Yes uh —

458
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:21,949
A nice, hot cup of tea and , uh —
and an aspirin...

459
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,868
and you'll be as right as rain.

460
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:30,040
You must be a bit lonely I expect...

461
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,001
now she's gone.

462
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:36,088
Yes I — I should have guessed it.

463
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:42,261
All alone by the telephone.

464
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:54,606
There's uh, no need to be alone, you know.

465
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,151
Huh?

466
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,486
Poor little girl.

467
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:02,197
All by herself.

468
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:05,450
All shaking like a little frightened animal.

469
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:15,460
Oh. Ah.

470
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,462
Ah.

471
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,217
Ah.

472
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,146
They're your family, hmm?

473
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,440
Very nice. Hmm.

474
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:44,072
Yeah. There's no need
to be frightened of me, you know.

475
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:53,749
Is that you?

476
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:58,003
Huh?

477
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:02,507
Where was it taken? 
In uh — In London?

478
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,678
- Brussels.
- Ah.

479
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:09,556
Ah. Brussels. Hmm.

480
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:33,330
I could be a very good friend to you,
you know.

481
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:40,128
You... look after me...

482
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:44,299
and you can forget about the rent.

483
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:50,055
Come on. Come on. Just —

484
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:53,141
Just a little kiss between friends, huh?
Come on.

485
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,499
You go on up. I'll park the car.

486
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,130
Carol?

487
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:52,430
Carol! Are you in?

488
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,698
Carol?

489
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:41,980
I say what`s the matter?

490
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:45,650
What a terrible smell.

491
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:49,070
What the hell's going on?
Well, get a grip of yourself, will you?

492
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:54,367
Now, what's the matter?

493
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,456
Ba — Bathroom.

494
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:58,765
No! Oh!

495
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,393
Go in there.

496
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:05,980
Just sit — sit there.

497
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:25,583
- Have you got a phone?
- Who are you?

498
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:27,877
I need to phone. I need to phone!

499
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,463
- Want a telephone?
- Yes, a telephone.

500
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:33,383
Oh.

501
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:10,461
Everything will be all right.

502
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:13,715
He's gone to the porter's room
to make a telephone call.

503
01:40:13,799 --> 01:40:16,217
She doesn't speak English does she?

504
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:18,302
Yes, I think she does.

505
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:38,906
What's the matter? What's happened?

506
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:41,075
I don't know. We just came in.

507
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:45,580
Let's see. Oh.

508
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:47,665
Oh.

509
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:14,859
Now, you better not touch her.
They've sent —

510
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:18,696
- I won't forget tonight in a hurry.
- Now come — Now don't touch her.

511
01:41:18,781 --> 01:41:20,865
I'll get her some brandy.

512
01:41:20,949 --> 01:41:24,327
- Has anyone called for an ambulance?
- Yes. He's gone to telephone now.

513
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:27,872
- Who?
- Man we saw on the stairs.

514
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:31,209
- Ah.
- Can anyone do artificial respiration?

515
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:33,586
You shouldn't touch her.
You shouldn't move her.

516
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,047
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get her some brandy.

517
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:40,718
Somebody must help her.
Please, someone help her.

518
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:06,327
I wouldn't touch her. Don't touch her.

519
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:10,081
What's he doing?

520
01:42:14,336 --> 01:42:16,295
- Oh.
- Good Lord.

521
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,090
- Oh, he's gotten her up.
- Please!

522
01:42:19,174 --> 01:42:21,425
He shouldn't touch her.
