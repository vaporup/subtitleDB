1
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,294
General, the Princess' convoy
has entered our realm.

2
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,997
Prepare to receive them.

3
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:44,237
Prepare to receive them!

4
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:31,116
General Meng Yi of Qin

5
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,743
welcomes Your Highness.

6
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,221
May it please Her Highness.

7
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,049
May it please Her Highness.

8
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,392
His Imperial Majesty decrees -

9
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,740
<i>Princess Ok Soo shall be Concubine Li of Qin,</i>

10
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,110
<i>for our nations' mutual concord.</i>

11
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,746
<i>Princess Ok Soo is so commanded.</i>

12
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:36,110
My orders are to bring back Princess Ok Soo.

13
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,350
Whoever interferes shall die!

14
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,687
Her Royal Highness is now Concubine Li of Qin.

15
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,387
Whoever dares is an enemy of our state!

16
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:55,261
They leave us no alternative.

17
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,200
Prepare to attack.

18
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,332
Prepare to attack!

19
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,700
Ready defenses.

20
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,641
Ready defenses.

21
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,241
Hurry! Protect the Princess!

22
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,818
Hurry! Away from this place!

23
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,602
Come back with me, Princess.

24
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,005
You are already my betrothed.

25
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,848
I cannot go back with you.

26
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:35,082
I cannot abide you
marrying the moribund emperor.

27
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,752
It's a surrender of our sovereignty to Qin!

28
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,625
I was forced into this decision.
Please understand.

29
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:48,528
You are a general!
How can you besmirch my honor?

30
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,125
Come!

31
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,933
My mission is to protect the Princess.

32
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:33,036
Draw. Let's both fulfill our missions.

33
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,873
Protect the Princess.

34
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,706
Save her!

35
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,213
Run!

36
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,060
Your Highness!

37
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,570
28 Feb 2005.

38
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,601
I had the same dream from months ago.

39
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,741
This time... I'm an ancient general,

40
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,312
leading a vast army to rescue...

41
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:00,891
some sort of princess.

42
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,628
I fell off a cliff...

43
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,161
William? You're back in Hong Kong?

44
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,707
Great! Come on over!

45
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,850
Talk about being all at sea!

46
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,044
How come you live on a barge?

47
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,917
The research budget was halved last year.

48
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,616
With the project unfinished,

49
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,383
I had to sell the flat.

50
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,854
So I moved here with my study.

51
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,664
It's not so bad! Pretty roomy here.

52
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,864
So why are you back suddenly?
Didn't like the States?

53
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,700
I came to solve your financial problems.

54
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,095
Can I?

55
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,672
I want you to do something for me.

56
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,177
<i>Hi William!
This must be Dr. Chan.</i>

57
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:58,946
Just call me Jack.

58
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,677
<i>I'm Maggie.
Welcome to our Anti-Gravity Research Project.</i>

59
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,815
Anti-Gravity?

60
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,121
This is my lab.
Check it out.

61
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,256
<i>Let's ask Dr. Smith to give
a little demonstration.</i>

62
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,798
<i>Doctor, please.</i>

63
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,801
<i>It's a well-known fact that spinning
an object at increased speed</i>

64
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,774
<i>can reduce its weight,</i>

65
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,245
<i>and we can already show the results.</i>

66
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,109
<i>These are very expensive experiments.</i>

67
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,914
<i>Quite impractical,</i>

68
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,751
<i>and unusable on living subjects,</i>

69
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,019
<i>as no living creature can survive such speed.</i>

70
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,821
Thank you, Maggie.

71
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,429
<i>You're welcome.</i>

72
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,196
I don't understand.
You're a physicist,

73
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,361
I'm an archaeologist.
How can I help you?

74
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,798
I’m seeking a breakthrough in the
field of mysterious phenomena...

75
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,472
...in a paper you wrote.

76
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,171
Over 2000 years ago
there was a tiny kingdom south of Dasar,

77
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,978
whose king became immortal after death.

78
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,383
His coffin floated in mid-air.

79
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,221
Your paper inspired me.

80
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,291
It's just a myth.

81
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,725
I can even lend you comic books about this.

82
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,161
Lots of things are called myths
prior to empirical verification.

83
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,392
Hey, Jack...

84
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,291
Wireless telephony was a myth 150 years ago.

85
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,067
So was the airplane, and landing on the moon!

86
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,869
Even 50 years ago,

87
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,740
computer and digital technology were a myth.

88
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,746
Many people are competing
to develop this technology.

89
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,341
If I succeed, I'll change human history...

90
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,444
This technology could be vital to our lives,

91
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,011
to surface and air transportation,

92
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,024
even inter-galactic travel!

93
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,094
I know you've always wanted
to do something great.

94
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,497
No one's ever entered this ancient tomb before.

95
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,464
But my work is archaeology,
and I have my ethic,

96
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,268
I do research, not raid tombs.

97
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,973
You still can't forget that
incident after all these years?

98
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,788
Something you'll never forget.

99
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,092
We haven't played for ages.

100
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,994
How's your game?

101
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,864
Jack.

102
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,807
Don't you practice anymore?

103
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,241
Sure! I just never shot from this angle before.

104
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,903
So why shoot?

105
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,378
Because you passed it to me.

106
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,006
Don't worry about it. Come on.

107
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,814
That Maggie is your girlfriend?

108
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,116
No. She represents my sponsor.

109
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,156
By the way, what happened to Monica?

110
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,283
Monica? Forget her.

111
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,055
I've been dreaming about a princess.

112
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,858
Her name's Ok Soo.

113
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:01,025
I called out her name in my sleep.

114
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,261
How do you think Monica took it?

115
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,198
Now back to business.
Jack,

116
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,104
you've never been a stickler for rules.

117
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,405
You've always trusted your instincts.

118
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:15,539
Instincts helped you unravel
the Dead Sea Scrolls forgery...

119
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,146
Jack, hey...

120
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,984
Jack!

121
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,390
Jack, do as your instincts tell you.

122
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:32,124
I want to prove it's not a myth,
but something real.

123
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,841
You're my best friend.

124
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,076
I trust you won't let me face danger alone.

125
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,908
Ever tried hitting a golf shot like this?

126
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,651
Jack!

127
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,010
What's with you?

128
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,545
I think I've got heat stroke.

129
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,215
Almost there. Come on!

130
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,385
Don't lie to me now.

131
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,221
You should exercise more regularly.

132
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,061
I do! 3 hours of golf each day,

133
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,964
2 hours of tennis...

134
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,230
And another dozen hours
a day playing video games,

135
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,931
you'll go blind in no time.

136
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,064
If you're so fit why don't you carry me?

137
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,506
You can walk.

138
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,934
Hurry up. We won't get in if we're late!

139
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,454
Jack, that's the holy man who can fly?

140
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,082
Yes. Let's go over there.

141
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,959
He really can fly...

142
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,370
Get up. Follow me.

143
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,607
Hey, up, up.

144
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,747
- Hurry.
- Give me a hand.

145
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,450
Grab hold of my leg!

146
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,085
- You've got strong legs.
- Let go!

147
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,190
Wow! Nice stone carvings!

148
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,261
You have no idea how many stories they tell.

149
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,025
I didn't come this far on my last expedition.

150
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,079
Jack!

151
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,097
The stone coffin's just floating there.

152
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,463
Zoom in and see if it's suspended by wire.

153
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,229
I’m working on it already.

154
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:30,242
Jack, there's a sword beside the coffin.

155
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,704
I can see it.

156
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:36,238
I think the inscription records his deeds.

157
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,707
Mission to Qin?

158
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:44,519
<i>This prince once brought
treasures and women to Qin.</i>

159
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,583
<i>The Qin Emperor gifted him one of his concubines,</i>

160
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:53,360
<i>but he picked the Emperor’s favourite.</i>

161
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:57,460
<i>The Emperor reneged and gave him
her painting instead,</i>

162
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:01,473
<i>as well as the Qin Star Gem in apology.</i>

163
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:07,446
The prince even fought a bout
with Qin's greatest warrior,

164
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,538
and exchanged sword with him.

165
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,385
- Hey! Don't!
- What?

166
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,068
Jack!

167
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,794
Are you all right?

168
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,364
What did you just move?

169
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,178
I've never seen stones like these.
I want some for research.

170
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,340
I told you not to steal anything!

171
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,680
I was going to return it afterwards.

172
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,813
It almost costs me my life!

173
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:52,490
How come the coffin fell
as soon as I pulled it out?

174
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,644
<i>His Majesty commanded me...</i>

175
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,382
<i>to paint a portrait of Concubine Li
as a gift to the Prince of Dasar.</i>

176
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,185
She doesn't smile, how can I paint?

177
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,657
I've not seen her smile since she arrived.

178
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,663
<i>General Meng!</i>

179
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,551
Excellent! That's the smile!

180
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,754
Jack!

181
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,300
Stop dreaming!

182
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,892
I hear footsteps!

183
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,363
Quick! Lift it up!

184
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,932
Why don't you ask them to help?

185
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,856
Jack! Help me!

186
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,342
Hey! Let go!

187
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,544
Who are you?

188
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,847
Why come and desecrate our sacred temple?

189
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,946
What do you gain by this?

190
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,793
I just came in to look for something,

191
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,459
I didn't mean to wreck the coffin,

192
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,400
it was an accident.

193
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,768
Sorry!

194
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,869
Are you all right?

195
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,882
I was apologizing.

196
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,975
How was I to know? I was just trying to help.

197
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,041
Let's go!

198
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,277
Told you not to steal!

199
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:46,052
It's for protection.

200
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,817
Let's go Jack!

201
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,894
Look, I took the painting for you as well.

202
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:52,988
What?

203
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:01,862
Run.

204
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,474
Get them!

205
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,370
Jack.

206
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,677
Wait.

207
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,476
Come on.

208
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,724
Get up. Let's go.

209
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,536
Get him, get them all!

210
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,781
Jack! Didn't you say you had backup?

211
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,650
All I see are monkeys!

212
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,525
You get on board first.

213
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:03,993
Jack!

214
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:07,767
Pick up some stones!

215
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,685
It is too dangerous, we have to leave now.

216
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,980
Come on! Jack!

217
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,543
- Fly a bit lower!
- No!

218
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,748
We are hit! We must go.

219
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:28,159
Come on up! Jack!

220
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,223
Jack!

221
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,196
Go and catch him!

222
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,008
Thank God!

223
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,262
Concubine Li!

224
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,567
Concubine Li...

225
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:35,217
Your Highness,
forgive my lapse in your protection.

226
00:27:58,811 --> 00:27:59,800
Halt!

227
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,336
Lay down your sword, or I'll kill her.

228
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,622
Don't!

229
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,318
If only one can live, I'd rather it be you.

230
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,228
Drop it!

231
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,714
General!

232
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,789
General Meng Yi!

233
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,664
Don't help me...

234
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,828
I'm beneath your station.

235
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,774
Why do you risk your life for me?

236
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,712
A blade is forged to drink the blood of enemies.

237
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,682
I am like a blade,
destined to fight for His Majesty,

238
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,718
and die for my country.

239
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:17,816
You are now Concubine Li of Qin.
Protecting you is my duty.

240
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,187
Your Highness has suffered a fright.

241
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:26,327
With you beside me I'm not afraid of anything.

242
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:35,262
We cannot stay here. We must leave quickly.

243
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,148
Lakchume... don't be naughty.

244
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:28,449
Good boy, good boy, Lakchume.

245
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,984
Lakchume? Where are you going?

246
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,420
Oh my god. It's a body.

247
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,326
Lakchume, hurry up.

248
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,497
Lakchume, pick up the body.

249
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,363
Easy, easy...

250
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,943
Be careful... be careful, good boy.

251
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,645
How are you feeling now?

252
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,514
Much better. Thank you.

253
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:37,979
How did I get here?

254
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,009
You were injured very badly,
the flow of the river brought you here.

255
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,487
- Where's my...
- Sword?

256
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,548
Come with me. This way.

257
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,288
What is this place?

258
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,991
This is the birthplace of the Dasar martial arts.

259
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,364
It has a history of 3,000 years.

260
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,701
My uncle, he is a master of the 275th generation.

261
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,667
There he is.

262
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,702
I heard you made the news in Dasar.

263
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,436
I am so sorry to have caused so much trouble.

264
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,635
You wrecked the coffin of a Dasar King!

265
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:43,274
But you also broke the
2,000-year-old myth of Dasar.

266
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:49,518
For generations now,
the locals don't understand spiritual training.

267
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:57,154
All they understand is to genuflect
before those levitating holy men.

268
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,031
Today they have learnt at least one thing -

269
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:07,196
spiritual training is not about
raising your head and looking up.

270
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:16,037
it is about lowering your head
and learn humility and honesty.

271
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,144
Young man, I know why you came.

272
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,552
This is no ordinary sword.

273
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,115
Is it yours?

274
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,155
Guothum.

275
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,271
The sword is not mine
and I didn't come to fight.

276
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,070
I just came to find some answers

277
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,777
Fight for your answers.

278
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:15,325
Young man... young man

279
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:24,469
Now do you have the answer in your heart?

280
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:28,703
You can become one with your sword!

281
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,682
It must be a bond from lifetimes ago.

282
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,687
Master, do you really believe in past lives?

283
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:42,960
Which life is a past life;
and which life is present life?

284
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:46,562
What is an illusion, and what is real?

285
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:50,429
I always dream of an ancient
general and a princess,

286
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,665
I don't know if this has anything to do with me.

287
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:57,504
And I don't even know if the things
in my dream really happened.

288
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:01,273
Yesterday I saw the picture of
the princess inside a tomb.

289
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:05,749
This is the first time my dream
was reflected in reality.

290
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:09,286
Master, I am really confused.

291
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:12,721
A dream may seem amazing and without reason,

292
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,692
but it can explain reality.

293
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:20,397
Dreams are made of your
imagination and creativity,

294
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,764
and your memories of reality.

295
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:29,637
That's why they seem so
imaginary and yet so real.

296
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:35,237
Because you always dream of one person,

297
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,747
it could be a sign that...

298
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:45,222
the memories locked deep into
your heart are getting released.

299
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,653
Memories?

300
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,891
What should I do? Who is he?

301
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,864
What is he trying to tell me?

302
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:00,298
Only you can find the answer you need.

303
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,502
Meng Yi...

304
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,100
General Meng Yi!

305
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,515
General, come in.

306
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,122
Meng Yi...

307
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,063
Meng Yi? General Meng Yi?

308
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:48,135
You promised to protect me. You can't die!

309
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,042
Meng Yi?

310
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:19,635
Meng Yi? Meng Yi...

311
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:33,014
I have nothing left in this world,

312
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,721
not even a relative.

313
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,056
Please don't abandon me!

314
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,622
I have nothing left but you.

315
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:16,158
Please don't leave me alone!

316
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:14,515
General Meng Yi. Over here quickly.

317
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:25,532
This is the first time I've felt so free.

318
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:28,204
No courtly rites and regulations.

319
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,801
What a beautiful feeling!

320
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,509
This is the first time
I've seen Your Highness smile.

321
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,741
Why don't you look at me?

322
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:39,113
Your humble servant does not dare.

323
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,981
Don't say such things.
Don't take away this feeling...

324
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:49,122
I'll stop calling you General.

325
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,561
How's that, Meng Yi?

326
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,740
I want to dance. Shall I dance for you?

327
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,834
No, Your Highness. You mustn't.

328
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:09,539
In this world,
only the Emperor himself may watch.

329
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:13,177
This is a dance for you alone.

330
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,908
Please, Your Highness.

331
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,763
We have reached the Great Wall.

332
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:18,673
This is entirely our realm.

333
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,408
Our capital Xianyang is just over the hill.

334
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,478
You are now safe, Concubine Li.

335
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:31,018
I have accomplished my mission finally.

336
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,715
No! I don't want to go to Xianyang.

337
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:40,854
Take me away! Take me anywhere!

338
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:43,332
I only want to be with you!

339
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,861
I don't want to marry the Emperor!

340
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:08,519
Why did we struggle to stay alive,

341
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:12,726
just to become slaves to Destiny?

342
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,227
When will we ever be free?

343
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,866
Not until the day we die?

344
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,492
Ok Soo... Concubine Li...

345
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,289
Your Highness, please calm down.

346
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:48,230
Don't forget your own mission.

347
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,028
You must live for the sake of your people.

348
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:53,160
Only with life is there hope.

349
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,834
Promise me, you must live!

350
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:03,040
You would have me live in such agony?

351
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,384
Very well!

352
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,384
I promise you!

353
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,586
I'll live for you!

354
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,397
Jack!

355
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:31,139
The police are after you!

356
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,904
- What?
- That's him!

357
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,439
We have to get out of here.
Come here, come with me.

358
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:49,890
Come with me, Jack!

359
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,960
Put it down! Put it down!

360
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,163
Oh my God! Let's go!

361
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:08,131
This way.

362
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,221
Why are you helping him?

363
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:27,490
Did you help him to break into the temple?

364
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,186
You! Freeze!

365
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,683
Wow what?

366
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:03,022
Wow means you are very good.

367
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:08,457
This way, Jack!

368
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,200
Don't jump! No!

369
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,605
No what?

370
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,175
Never mind.

371
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:06,507
What are you doing?

372
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,084
Helping you.

373
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:09,241
Jack.

374
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:23,558
Jack.

375
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,362
Jack, help me!

376
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,505
Jack, help me!

377
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,504
Jack, help me.

378
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,716
Give me your hands!

379
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,713
Jump!

380
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:52,886
Come on!

381
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,722
Wait!

382
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:57,825
What?

383
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,301
Sorry.

384
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,538
Let's go!

385
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:26,321
Along the river for two days,
it will take you to China.

386
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,156
Thank you so much.

387
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,631
Will I ever see you again?

388
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,271
I will definitely come back
to see you and your master.

389
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:39,471
Take care.

390
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:08,597
I’m levitating!

391
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:14,209
We've examined it by every means
from spectroscope to MRI.

392
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,208
What is unbelievable is...

393
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,476
that its atomic spectra...

394
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,951
didn't remotely match
any known material on Earth,

395
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,512
including the spectra measured
by the Icarus Project.

396
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:30,420
This particular spectra was
in one of the last transmissions,

397
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:31,291
before the detector flew out of the solar system.

398
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,489
Mid-air coffee break!

399
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:38,559
However if the light emitted
from the stone gets blocked,

400
00:55:38,636 --> 00:55:41,002
it would be functionless.

401
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:43,630
Maggie!

402
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:45,536
Don't!

403
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:54,876
Hello?

404
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:58,652
Jack, our project has succeeded...

405
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,313
Well, almost!

406
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:03,826
What? It's a meteorite?

407
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:06,556
From outside our Solar system?

408
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,657
<i>That's right. We must now find the rest of them.</i>

409
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,765
<i>Where's the painting from the coffin?</i>

410
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:14,599
It's here with me.

411
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:17,339
I’m going to Xian. Meet me there.

412
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,705
Bring the painting with you.

413
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,806
Good, bye for now.

414
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,317
I’m coming with you.

415
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:01,941
My initial assessment:

416
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:06,456
It's forged around the Qin dynasty.

417
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,559
The scale-like surface material

418
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:12,391
is found only in Qin-dynasty artifacts.

419
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:15,455
Looking at the design and decorations,

420
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:19,328
I'd say it belonged to a Qin general.

421
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:21,769
This is a national treasure!

422
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,967
Be careful.

423
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,081
What are you doing? The sword is ours!

424
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:35,512
Jack has bequeathed it to our museum.

425
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:41,150
Our foundation financed this project.

426
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:43,451
Anything found should belong to the foundation.

427
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:45,495
How can you donate the sword to the museum?

428
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,621
The sword's a Grade One national relic.

429
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,461
It belongs to all of humanity.

430
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:52,434
It's only right we return it
to the world via the museum.

431
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:55,802
Anyway what's key to the
project are the meteorites.

432
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,171
These two artifacts have nothing to do with them.

433
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,804
Before my experiments draw a conclusion,

434
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,846
anything may prove to be a critical link.

435
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,938
How can you prejudge it by saying otherwise?

436
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:06,949
My experiments will benefit all mankind.

437
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,577
Artifacts are old, dead things.

438
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,382
They have no life, no future!

439
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:13,685
What science is concerned with
is precisely the future!

440
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:15,156
Fine, if that's what you say,

441
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:17,860
then how come these 2000-year-old artifacts

442
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,054
are so important to you?

443
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,097
I risked my life for that sword!

444
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,894
That was me!

445
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,600
OK! In that case, when I find the meteorites,

446
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,935
you'll still give them away?

447
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,498
Yes.

448
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:35,870
As long as it's someone else's artifacts
I'll return them.

449
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:38,640
No one can plunder relics
from someone else's country

450
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:40,411
and put them in their own museums.

451
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:43,419
They call it 'safe-keeping' but it's theft.

452
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:45,614
It's despicable behavior.

453
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,452
So what are we going to do now?

454
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:53,187
What can I do?

455
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:02,898
William.

456
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:06,835
Do you want to meet your sponsor
for the last 10 years?

457
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:10,445
Of course! But he doesn't want to see me!

458
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,648
I'll bring you to him now.

459
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,039
Right now?

460
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,551
Come with me.

461
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:25,891
I'll return these relics to Dasar for you.

462
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,188
Thank you.

463
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:49,617
Professor Koo? It's you?

464
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,550
It's been years since I was a professor.

465
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:07,035
Mr. Koo, you've been funding
my work all these years?

466
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:11,541
That's right.
I had my eye on you even before you graduated.

467
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:16,507
Maggie, cancel my contract with the foundation.

468
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,775
I won't accept sponsorship

469
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,817
from a tomb-raiding 'archaeologist'!

470
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,581
<i>And you and Jack</i>

471
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:29,751
<i>weren't raiding tombs in Dasar?</i>

472
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,789
I've unearthed many treasures in my lifetime,

473
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,625
<i>but the best ones I found</i>

474
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:42,194
<i>are you and Jack.</i>

475
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,573
Don't you hate him?

476
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,199
No.

477
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:50,271
Even if he has hurt me deeply.

478
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:57,677
So what do you want from me?

479
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,954
Stay with Jack.

480
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:06,652
<i>Enlighten him.</i>

481
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:11,668
He'll make you the world's greatest scientist.

482
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,161
<i>Isn't that your life's dream?</i>

483
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,840
The 36th year of the Emperor's reign.

484
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:27,816
Star fell on eastern province,
turned to stone on Earth.

485
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:34,023
<i>The meteorite was engraved
with a curse on the Emperor.</i>

486
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:38,892
<i>So the Emperor tried to kill
everyone around him...</i>

487
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:45,265
<i>to keep the secret of the meteorite.</i>

488
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:07,215
Look! General Nangong's returned!

489
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,919
Out of the way!

490
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:23,336
Report to the General at once!

491
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:35,249
How is my father?

492
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:39,448
How is His Majesty?

493
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:41,748
<i>Report!</i>

494
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:45,022
General Nangong has returned
with important intelligence.

495
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,008
Well, how is His Majesty?

496
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:06,475
His Majesty's...

497
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,048
General, the Immortal Pill is ready.

498
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:17,389
On his way back with it,
General Xu was ambushed by rebels.

499
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,493
Prepare the troops for departure.

500
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:21,720
Yes, sir.

501
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:23,499
- Fresh horses!
- Yes, sir!

502
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:29,094
If word gets out,
your whole clan will be executed!

503
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,741
Your servant wouldn't dare!

504
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,711
<i>Please tell the Chancellor,</i>

505
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:42,980
<i>I don't know anything. I'll never tell!</i>

506
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,186
<i>I... don't know anything.</i>

507
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,447
<i>Please assure the Chancellor...</i>

508
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,985
Father had too many people around him.

509
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:52,824
I fear for our plans.

510
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,955
The concubines are ready
to be entombed with him.

511
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,472
Your Majesty, the Immortal Pill is ready,

512
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:09,409
but was taken in a rebel ambush.

513
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,413
Your servant begs leave to
go retrieve it forthwith!

514
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:16,179
General Meng, your duty is His Majesty's safety.
You should stay...

515
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:19,244
Action is most urgent!

516
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,448
I await His Majesty's decree.

517
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:30,565
His Majesty commands General Meng...

518
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:31,961
to retrieve the pill!

519
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,195
As ordered!

520
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,567
Wait!

521
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:40,135
His Majesty has few troops in his entourage.

522
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:45,876
If you go all out for the pill,
and the rebels strike,

523
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:49,009
I fear for His Majesty's safety.

524
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:54,916
In that case I'll only take the Light Cavalry.

525
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,068
I won't tell!

526
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:07,902
<i>His Majesty still needs treatment!</i>

527
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:10,333
<i>Let me try once more!</i>

528
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,909
General Meng Yi!

529
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:32,292
Farewell, Your Highness.

530
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,963
You must come back!

531
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:41,093
The Pill can save His Majesty's life,
and therefore yours too.

532
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:46,067
Yi swears, my heart is yours forever.

533
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,188
I await your return.

534
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,296
Attention, soldiers of the Meng clan!

535
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,391
Those with aged parents are excused!

536
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,332
The only sons are excused!

537
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:23,345
Husbands and fathers are excused!

538
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:30,917
Those who are excused guard the camp!
The rest of you, mount!

539
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,549
General!

540
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,085
How many years have we shared our honor?

541
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,596
Why can we not live and die together now?

542
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:47,366
Nangong Yan swears to follow you even unto death!

543
01:06:52,442 --> 01:07:06,288
We swear to follow the General!...

544
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,829
I have orders from the Chancellor
to take the Pill.

545
01:08:57,067 --> 01:09:01,231
Failure to hand it over is disobedience, Xu Gui!

546
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,338
I can only give the Pill to General Meng,

547
01:09:04,441 --> 01:09:09,071
but no one else.

548
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:26,061
The Chancellor bears His Majesty's word.

549
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:30,596
Obey or die!

550
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,374
Prepare to attack!

551
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:44,508
Prepare to attack!

552
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:49,816
Defenses!

553
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,518
Ready archers!

554
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:10,831
Shoot!

555
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:20,579
Charge!

556
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,122
Attack!

557
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:34,514
Zhao Kuang, His Majesty orders!
Yield at once!

558
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,624
You dare fake an Imperial Decree?

559
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:40,659
General Meng?

560
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,327
Leave none alive!

561
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:51,966
General Zhao, General Meng
comes with an Imperial Decree!

562
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,233
Why do you disobey?

563
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,778
Your disobedience in the field will be punished!

564
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,404
Attack!

565
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:12,293
Soldiers at the back!

566
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:14,956
No one moves without my orders!

567
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:17,826
Attack!

568
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:23,825
Xu Gui!

569
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:32,407
- General Meng!
- Meng Jie?

570
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:34,576
The Chancellor wants you dead.

571
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:36,702
Behind my troops is the only way out.

572
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:43,680
General, there's no time!
You go with Meng Jie.

573
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,311
I'll hold them off.

574
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:46,912
Go!

575
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:50,653
After them!

576
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:56,559
Out of the way!

577
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,065
Out of the way!

578
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:08,440
My bow!

579
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:16,450
Out of the way! Everyone out of the way!

580
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,430
Go! Hurry!

581
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,403
Go!

582
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,924
Black Wind!

583
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,203
Archers, ready!

584
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:50,443
Shoot!

585
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:02,882
Shoot!

586
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,188
General!

587
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:12,928
Take the Pill and go!

588
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,559
General!

589
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:17,833
The Pill must reach the Emperor!

590
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:20,800
Protect Concubine Li!

591
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,705
General! Farewell!

592
01:16:25,515 --> 01:16:26,777
Go!

593
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,943
Black Wind, you have done your duty.

594
01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:14,996
Jack.

595
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,926
Sorry. You were right.

596
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,867
Those relics should be returned.

597
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:24,773
I made you something. I hope you like it.

598
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,107
Thank you.

599
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:34,706
I looked up the geographical data
within 500 miles of Xian.

600
01:17:34,784 --> 01:17:38,811
You once told me your dreams
of waterfalls and tunnels.

601
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:41,156
I hope this will help.

602
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,752
How far is this waterfall from Mount Li?

603
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:49,127
About 200 kilometers.

604
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,708
Sensors indicate a huge cave
behind the waterfall.

605
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,005
There were many rainstorms one year,

606
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:04,603
and the cave never reappeared since.

607
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,170
Thank you. Good-bye.

608
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:11,586
Jack, there's a cave behind the waterfall.

609
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:13,178
and a huge opening behind the cave.

610
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:16,953
That's right.
A dozen years ago there was a drought.

611
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,687
The water dried up.

612
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:20,661
The cave behind the waterfall appeared,

613
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:22,721
and a foolhardy villager climbed in.

614
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,759
Then it started to rain,

615
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:27,394
water quickly concealed the entrance again.

616
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,930
The villager was never seen again.

617
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:32,941
What do you plan to do?

618
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,373
I’m going into the waterfall.

619
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:35,770
How?

620
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:37,142
Get flushed in.

621
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:40,376
You crazy? That's very dangerous!

622
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,743
You don't even know if your dream is real!

623
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:49,051
Sure! I don't know if it's real or not,

624
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:52,094
or who the person in the dream is to me.

625
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:55,130
But I can feel her love.

626
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:58,298
So you're saying, unless you unravel this dream,

627
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:00,164
you'll never be at peace.

628
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:24,091
What a blessed place!

629
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:27,785
Wind, water, all the elements are in place.

630
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:34,067
Jack, only you could have brought me here.

631
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:03,318
William, do you copy?

632
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:07,226
Loud and clear, Jack. I can see you.

633
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:09,797
I'll contact you as soon as I'm in.

634
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,523
But if...

635
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,359
No ifs and buts.

636
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,869
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

637
01:21:17,406 --> 01:21:18,566
I'll be in touch.

638
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:20,438
Don't worry.

639
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:25,442
Whether it's brain or brawn, he's your superior.

640
01:22:56,572 --> 01:23:00,167
Jack what's happening?

641
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:04,469
Jack...

642
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,047
Are you all right?

643
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:08,310
My ass hurts.

644
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:21,288
William, I see an opening...

645
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,263
with man-made designs.

646
01:23:23,532 --> 01:23:25,090
Like the sketches you drew?

647
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,691
I'll see if I can get inside.

648
01:23:27,937 --> 01:23:29,962
Contact you later.

649
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,008
Get ready to begin.

650
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:36,400
Now!

651
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,528
Meng Yi.

652
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:15,463
Meng Yi...

653
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,435
you've finally returned!

654
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:34,222
I am your Ok Soo.
You've finally come!

655
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,088
Ok Soo...

656
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:42,192
It's really you?

657
01:26:46,335 --> 01:26:48,269
You were really waiting for me!

658
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:51,433
Am I dreaming?

659
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:56,572
I promised I'd live for you!
I've kept my word.

660
01:26:57,112 --> 01:27:01,879
You kept yours too.
You've really returned!

661
01:27:23,272 --> 01:27:25,331
Jack!

662
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:32,305
Jack, thank you!

663
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:34,874
Without you,

664
01:27:35,551 --> 01:27:39,647
this secret will stay buried
for another eternity!

665
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:44,325
This place is exactly like Jack's dream!

666
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,786
I can't explain it scientifically.

667
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:50,364
There are many things in this world...

668
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:54,425
...that science can't explain.

669
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:56,934
This cavern stays warm the year round.

670
01:27:57,172 --> 01:28:01,609
It's shunt off from the world
but air flows freely.

671
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:04,971
They made massive constructions at Mount Li,

672
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:09,411
but dug a 100-mile tunnel

673
01:28:09,485 --> 01:28:13,546
to build the mausoleum here.

674
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:17,625
Brilliant!

675
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,726
A masterstroke of deception!

676
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:26,325
But where's the entrance to the mausoleum?

677
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,301
Your Highness! Beware!

678
01:31:01,423 --> 01:31:03,755
Stop! General Nangong!

679
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,025
He's Meng Yi! General Meng!

680
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:14,659
Impossible!

681
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:18,904
He can't be General Meng!

682
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,137
No warrior is General Meng's match!
How can he be him?

683
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:30,375
He really is General Meng!
There's no mistake!

684
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,655
You really are the General?

685
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,155
Greetings to the General!

686
01:31:46,034 --> 01:31:48,901
Sir, I have followed your order

687
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:52,497
to protect Concubine Li pending your return.

688
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:57,769
Mr. Koo...

689
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,655
Great work, Mr. Koo!

690
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:14,059
You've discovered the secret of levitation.

691
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:22,834
Weightlessness carries grave dangers.

692
01:32:23,572 --> 01:32:26,473
If we lose traction and float off,

693
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:30,568
we'll be adrift forever,
and turn into living fossils.

694
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,207
Hold on!

695
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:47,025
After I left you that day,
I returned with the Pill.

696
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:49,859
His Majesty was barely alive,

697
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:52,126
but Zhao Gao doubted the Pill's veracity.

698
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,135
He ordered me to personally test it.

699
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:57,537
Chancellor Li said...

700
01:32:57,672 --> 01:33:01,802
it was our honor to test
the Pill for the Emperor,

701
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:04,277
and forced me to take it too.

702
01:33:04,546 --> 01:33:08,277
And so, those who wanted to live didn't,

703
01:33:08,517 --> 01:33:11,645
and those who wished to die can never do so.

704
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:14,188
General, what happened that day

705
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:16,053
after I left?

706
01:33:20,962 --> 01:33:24,022
That day, after I gave you the Pill...

707
01:33:27,803 --> 01:33:31,261
Black Wind, you have done your duty.

708
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:30,325
Fighting by your side today

709
01:34:30,565 --> 01:34:34,057
has been Xu Gui's greatest honor in life.

710
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,765
I take my leave...

711
01:34:52,654 --> 01:34:53,780
Halt!

712
01:35:03,632 --> 01:35:04,758
Attack!

713
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,638
Attack!

714
01:36:55,043 --> 01:36:56,305
Surrender, General!

715
01:36:56,378 --> 01:36:58,846
Surrender, General!

716
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:03,127
No, never...

717
01:39:04,205 --> 01:39:05,604
I won't believe it.

718
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:09,573
If General Meng fell in battle...

719
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:13,205
then who are you?

720
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,943
I am...

721
01:39:30,665 --> 01:39:32,599
Everything is as I expected.

722
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:49,306
Life after death...

723
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:53,915
...troops in an eternal vigil...

724
01:39:54,622 --> 01:39:56,920
I've found you at last!

725
01:39:57,892 --> 01:40:01,157
Who'd have thought,
the Qin Emperor would use the meteorite

726
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:03,959
to create a weightless world?

727
01:40:10,305 --> 01:40:12,466
General, did you bring troops?

728
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:14,573
No.

729
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:21,471
Wait for me here.

730
01:40:23,651 --> 01:40:24,982
Careful.

731
01:40:28,556 --> 01:40:31,582
Who dares to intrude the mausoleum?

732
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,028
A Qin-dynasty man?

733
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:37,625
Immortal?!

734
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:45,139
Jack! Are you all right?

735
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:48,664
William! You conned me from day one.

736
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,272
You've been working for him all along!

737
01:40:50,345 --> 01:40:51,710
I...

738
01:40:51,946 --> 01:40:55,006
Jack, I told you before.

739
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:56,516
Greed is human nature,

740
01:40:56,584 --> 01:41:00,645
and desire for knowledge drives us.

741
01:41:00,722 --> 01:41:04,055
I merely made use of William's greed,

742
01:41:04,459 --> 01:41:06,017
and your desire for knowledge.

743
01:41:06,094 --> 01:41:09,188
And now my life's work is complete!

744
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:14,433
When you turned me in, I told myself,

745
01:41:14,502 --> 01:41:18,336
one day you'll make it up to me.

746
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:24,568
Jack, all I want is to take some
stuff back for experiments.

747
01:41:24,679 --> 01:41:27,614
My discoveries will benefit the world.

748
01:41:27,982 --> 01:41:30,644
I'll become the greatest
scientist of the century!

749
01:41:30,718 --> 01:41:32,549
No one can take anything from here.

750
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:36,215
This is a part of history.
It should stay buried forever!

751
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:40,990
Without you,
I couldn't have solved this maze...

752
01:41:41,062 --> 01:41:43,997
in several lifetimes!

753
01:41:44,065 --> 01:41:45,157
Professor!

754
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:50,334
Scoundrel!
How dare you defile the mausoleum?

755
01:41:50,405 --> 01:41:52,270
The penalty is death!

756
01:42:05,186 --> 01:42:06,483
Nangong Yan! Careful!

757
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:13,356
Don't shoot! I want him alive!

758
01:42:40,788 --> 01:42:42,050
Take care of Ok Soo.

759
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:06,571
Where's the Immortality Pill?

760
01:43:07,548 --> 01:43:09,140
Tell me.

761
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:11,576
Halt!

762
01:43:20,828 --> 01:43:22,352
General Nangong!

763
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:41,344
'When the dragon pearl moves,
annihilation ensues'

764
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:12,474
Pull me in.

765
01:44:12,547 --> 01:44:14,276
Quick, give me a hand.

766
01:44:21,522 --> 01:44:22,921
General Nangong!

767
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,788
Concubine Li! Run!

768
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:37,169
<i>Give me your hand! Quick!</i>

769
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:42,174
<i>Use your legs.</i>

770
01:44:42,243 --> 01:44:44,803
<i>Right, your legs.</i>

771
01:44:55,323 --> 01:44:58,258
Pull me in.

772
01:45:07,935 --> 01:45:11,632
A Qin-dynasty Deputy Imperial General!

773
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:34,992
Tell me!

774
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,525
Where's the Immortality Pill?

775
01:45:39,267 --> 01:45:41,565
Where's the Qin Emperor's sarcophagus?

776
01:45:48,409 --> 01:45:50,468
It must be in the Celestial Palace.

777
01:45:54,916 --> 01:45:57,282
Take me there! Take me there!

778
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,452
Stay where you are!

779
01:46:08,062 --> 01:46:10,292
Don't you dare try to steal anything...

780
01:46:10,598 --> 01:46:12,623
or take her away!

781
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,930
That depends on whether you can stop me.

782
01:47:21,836 --> 01:47:25,101
Don't worry. I won't let anyone hurt you.

783
01:47:47,662 --> 01:47:50,688
Jack! Help me! Jack!

784
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:57,994
Jack!

785
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:07,611
Ok Soo, I'll take you away from here.

786
01:48:14,088 --> 01:48:15,487
Let's go.

787
01:48:38,045 --> 01:48:39,740
Jack...

788
01:48:39,814 --> 01:48:41,076
William!

789
01:48:42,183 --> 01:48:44,617
- William!
- Help me!

790
01:48:47,788 --> 01:48:49,119
Hang on to me!

791
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:51,158
I only do scientific research,

792
01:48:51,592 --> 01:48:53,560
I’m no tomb raider!

793
01:49:00,568 --> 01:49:02,832
You must get out no matter what,

794
01:49:02,903 --> 01:49:05,235
and finish my research!

795
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:10,907
Jack...

796
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:17,209
Jack, are we still friends?

797
01:49:30,798 --> 01:49:32,163
Jack...

798
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:37,663
You really aren't Meng Yi?

799
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:42,670
No, I'm not...

800
01:49:45,513 --> 01:49:47,071
Whether I’m Meng Yi or not
doesn't matter now.

801
01:49:47,148 --> 01:49:49,241
What's important is that
we leave here at once!

802
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:53,044
You're not Meng Yi.

803
01:49:54,054 --> 01:49:56,079
I’m not leaving.

804
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:58,781
I'll await Meng Yi's return.

805
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,125
Ok Soo, hurry! There's no time!

806
01:50:01,662 --> 01:50:04,859
No! He's not dead!

807
01:50:04,932 --> 01:50:06,729
I'll wait for him!

808
01:50:06,901 --> 01:50:08,198
Ok Soo!

809
01:50:09,003 --> 01:50:10,527
Ok Soo!

810
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:57,640
At last! Immortality!

811
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,907
<i>Six months later</i>
