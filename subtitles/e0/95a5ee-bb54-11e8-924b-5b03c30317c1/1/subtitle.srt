1
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,210
"In the fourth month
of the Year of the Snake...

2
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,172
...a child shall be chosen...

3
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:33,468
...to meld the two halves of the sacred
medallion together as one.

4
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,721
And at his touch...

5
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,057
...the reborn shall be endowed...

6
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,812
...with extraordinary
supernatural powers."

7
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,691
You've done well.

8
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,777
As agreed.

9
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,617
Pitiful.

10
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,204
Many people would pay more...

11
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,957
...to be the keeper of such a book.

12
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,627
The only pitiful thing in this room...

13
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,212
...is your life.

14
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,631
Okay.

15
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,883
Actually...

16
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,595
...you have been
quite generous, yeah?

17
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,920
It's nobody you know, okay?

18
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,926
It's fish. See?

19
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,240
Happy now?

20
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,367
Cheers.

21
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,649
In English, please.

22
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,819
Stop wasting time, Giscard.
Pull around the back.

23
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,953
Inspector.

24
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,748
Positive ID on Giscard.
Kwun Yum Temple.

25
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,292
- And he's got company.
- Copy that.

26
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,877
Hold your position.

27
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,681
Pai Gow.

28
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,268
It's our guy.

29
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,811
All right, men.

30
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,279
- And Snakehead?
- Snakehead was not confirmed.

31
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,488
We should wait.

32
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,323
My intelligence says he's here...

33
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,034
...and Giscard is his number one.
We're going in.

34
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,738
I did not agree to this.

35
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,283
- We are supposed to be partners.
- This is an Interpol operation.

36
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,202
The Hong Kong
Police Department's...

37
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,996
...involvement is strictly
a babysitting service.

38
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,626
You don't like it,
take it up with your boss.

39
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,100
It's true.

40
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,812
Tell him we found it and we're in.

41
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,426
Full force, men.

42
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,303
Razor-sharp and all that.

43
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

44
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,061
That's a temple. It's a holy place.

45
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,813
You cannot take guns in there.

46
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,441
Oh, right. Well, don't worry, Eddie,
because you see these guns?

47
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,860
They're holey guns.

48
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,613
Because they make
a rather big holey.

49
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,659
Holey. Do you get it? Holey.

50
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,000
All right.

51
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,210
Move out, men!

52
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,634
Move. Left, right, left, right.
Go, go, go.

53
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,511
Come on, keep up.

54
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,532
Inter...

55
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,160
Freeze!

56
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,537
Damn.

57
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,220
Keep up. Keep up. Keep up.

58
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,056
Interpol! Freeze!

59
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,791
The medallion.

60
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,795
You cannot come in he...

61
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,232
You will give me what I want.

62
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,137
What's that?

63
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,805
Check it out.

64
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,642
- Go that way.
- Got it.

65
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,214
Peter?

66
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,007
Eddie.

67
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,568
Interpol! Fre...

68
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,074
What the he...?

69
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,123
You okay?

70
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,918
This way, men.
Follow me. Down here.

71
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,298
It's the cops!

72
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,425
We've gotta go now!

73
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,968
I need more time.

74
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,640
- We haven't finished yet.
- It's too late.

75
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,976
- We'll try again later!
- Hong Kong Police!

76
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,781
Jai!

77
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,789
Hang on!

78
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,138
Eddie!

79
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,141
Snakehead! Upstairs!

80
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,644
Right!

81
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,415
Damn!

82
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,543
Four months' work!

83
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,379
What did he want in the temple?

84
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,715
He's a smuggler, Eddie. I don't know.

85
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:23,262
Perhaps he's found a buyer for
black-market Buddhas. The point is...

86
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,139
...you let him get away.

87
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,017
Watson.

88
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,020
I also saw his face.

89
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:40,612
Interpol's all over me,
and I can't stay here any longer.

90
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,365
You must bring me the boy in Dublin.

91
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,827
I trust you will make my continued...

92
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,162
Just bring me the boy.

93
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,970
Good job.
Okay, this is what I want.

94
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,763
All right, notify the team...

95
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,057
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

96
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,684
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

97
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,021
Got it. The Sea Horizon.

98
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,986
- Where are you keeping the boy?
- In a safe place.

99
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,863
Very good. Take me to him.

100
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,406
Up there. Okay.

101
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,999
- Where is he?
- Over here.

102
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,336
Wait. Put him down. Put him down!

103
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,130
Untie him. Don't hurt him.

104
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,548
Careful. Be careful.

105
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,341
Inspector, what's going on?

106
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,926
Snakehead's men.

107
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,095
Yes. Hello.

108
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,389
It's the boy.

109
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,314
Good morning, sir.

110
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,648
Show me the boy.

111
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,609
Oh. Of course.

112
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:28,822
That's him.

113
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,409
Treat him like a prince.

114
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:36,121
No problem, sir. We are ready to go.

115
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:40,000
Attention! This is the marine police.

116
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,753
You are ordered to stand down!

117
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,130
Prepare to be boarded.

118
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,882
Attention!

119
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,051
- Showtime!
- This is the marine police.

120
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,845
You are ordered to stand down!

121
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,514
Prepare to be boarded!

122
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,557
This is the marine police.

123
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,434
Look out!

124
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,027
Let's go!

125
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,446
Quickly! Go! Go!

126
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,549
Are you ready?

127
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,134
I'll cover you.

128
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,656
The boy!

129
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,874
Wave bye-bye!

130
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,509
We've interrogated the prisoner, Inspector.

131
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:39,388
The boy's been taken to Snakehead
in Ireland. Repeat, Ireland.

132
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,936
Time for vacation.

133
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,271
Call me in Ireland.

134
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,273
Bring me back a snake head.

135
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,815
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes.

136
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:34,401
I'm Inspector Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

137
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,739
Yes. You have an appointment to the
commander.

138
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,162
Nicole.

139
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,955
Inspector Eddie Yang.

140
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,416
I knew there couldn't be two of you.

141
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,709
Nice.

142
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,503
You clean up well.

143
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:53,962
Thank you.

144
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,016
Come on.

145
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:16,985
It's been a long time.

146
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,195
Three months.

147
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,489
I was assigned overseas and...

148
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,533
Oh, yeah.

149
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,326
You were gonna call me.

150
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,996
- I didn't know you'd been assigned...
- To Ireland?

151
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,958
- Yes.
- Well, you missed a few beats, Eddie.

152
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,793
I am now the official liaison...

153
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,005
...between the local Interpol office and
Southeast Asian security forces.

154
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,300
Maybe if you stayed in touch
like you promised...

155
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,845
Nicole.

156
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,221
I should have called.

157
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,806
I'm sorry.

158
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,142
That's worth something.

159
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,312
Not a lot, but something.

160
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:54,857
Commander?

161
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,484
Inspector Yang is here to see you.

162
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:58,777
Yes.

163
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,239
I'm Hammerstock-Smythe.
Delighted to meet you, inspector.

164
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,365
Likewise, commander.

165
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,368
Commander, I was just...

166
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:14,168
What the bloody hell is he doing here?

167
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:15,919
Hello, Watson.

168
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,340
You're not telling me he'll be working
on this case?

169
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,385
Watson, we need all the help
we can get.

170
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,762
Yes.

171
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,182
You remember this boy?

172
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,394
Yes, I saw him in the temple. So?

173
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:33,687
- Who's he?
- One moment.

174
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,232
Yes, I recognize him.

175
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,692
This is Lester Wong.

176
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,612
Snakehead's number two man.

177
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:45,199
That's privileged information,
eyes-only, need-to-know and all that.

178
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,994
- I need to find him, Watson.
- Yes, well, I'm sorry, my friend...

179
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,746
...but that's classified.

180
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,748
We've received a tip-off...

181
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,543
...that Snakehead does have a new
shipment arriving tomorrow in Ireland.

182
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,921
- Maybe the boy will come with it.
- Where?

183
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,756
We don't know.

184
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:04,510
Go back East, Eddie.
Stick to what you know.

185
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,263
- Watson!
- What?! I mean... Sorry. What?

186
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,973
Any more nonsense like this...

187
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,228
...and you will be off the case, and the
inspector here will be in charge of it.

188
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:18,357
Satisfied?
You've only been here five minutes.

189
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,196
Watson!

190
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,991
You are in my filing cabinet.

191
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,626
Yes.

192
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:41,380
I was just getting these.

193
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,884
I think we're in trouble.

194
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:51,014
Yes, I think everything is in order.
What do you think?

195
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,100
Is it? Well, yes.

196
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,811
- Well, let me have it checked out.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,980
Watson, wait.

198
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:02,442
- Let's put Hong Kong behind us.
- I'm sorry, is somebody talking to me?

199
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,404
We were partners.
We were good together.

200
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,116
- You need me.
- Really? What do you want me to do?

201
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,326
Just welcome you back
with open arms?

202
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,288
We had a good thing going,
and you left!

203
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,126
Watson.

204
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,837
It just wasn't for me anymore.

205
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,506
I thought you understood.

206
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,091
Oh, I understand.

207
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:30,470
I understand that you didn't like me
always being on top.

208
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,851
Okay, you can be on top.
Whatever you want.

209
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:39,104
Let's just do it together. Okay?

210
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:44,067
No, but you have fun doing it
by yourself. All right?

211
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:56,163
You think because of the way...

212
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,473
Thank you.

213
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:16,892
Think we...

214
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,685
Well, we're not.

215
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,479
I'm a man!

216
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:25,150
Yes. No, there's nothing wrong
when two people love...

217
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,360
...one another.

218
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,195
It's a good thing. I...

219
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,032
That's your fault, that is.

220
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,494
Now, I'm gonna go home
and cook dinner for my wife!

221
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,217
So on a scale of one to 10...

222
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,094
...how did that go?

223
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:55,305
About a seven.

224
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:58,892
Below zero.

225
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,108
I think I know just what you need.

226
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,195
Dinner.

227
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,864
Dinner?

228
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,407
Yes, dinner.

229
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,535
We need Watson
for this investigation, Eddie.

230
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:19,246
He's stubborn, but if we can
catch him off guard...

231
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,957
...maybe loosen him up,
I think we can work it out.

232
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:23,417
I'll just be myself.

233
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,382
One more thing.

234
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,467
Watson's family...

235
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,970
...they don't know
that he's an Interpol agent.

236
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,222
- What do they think he is?
- A librarian.

237
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,183
- A librarian?
- Yes.

238
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,769
Hi.

239
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:44,855
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.

240
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,274
Look, you can't just
turn up and barge in.

241
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:51,111
Darling, I was wondering
if you saw my spatula.

242
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,739
- Charlotte, hello.
- Hello.

243
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,700
- Please. Please come in. Please.
- Thank you.

244
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:00,120
Arthur, you didn't tell me we were
having guests.

245
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:02,289
- Please, welcome.
- Didn't know myself.

246
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,750
- We're librarians.
- Librarian?

247
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,589
Charlotte, this is Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

248
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,550
Are you staying for dinner?

249
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,177
- Yes.
- No. Absolutely not.

250
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,303
Thank you.

251
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,766
See what you've done to my chops?

252
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,646
What's that called?

253
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,189
Now?

254
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,442
"Lamb a la victim."

255
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,365
Right. Well, yes. Come on.
You know the score.

256
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,033
You eat, you work.

257
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,155
What brings you to Dublin?

258
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,369
- Right. I was looking for...
- Looking for a rare book.

259
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,830
Yes, actually, we were wondering...

260
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,708
...if Arthur would help us find this
rare book.

261
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:32,588
Oh, well, unfortunately, I'm looking for
that book myself, so...

262
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,048
Maybe we could find it together.

263
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:42,097
But I'm head librarian, though, right?

264
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:43,932
Right.

265
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,992
You need help checking in?

266
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,286
I already checked in.

267
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:06,205
Okay.

268
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,421
Here. Directions.
Where to meet Watson tomorrow.

269
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,256
He told me to give them to you.

270
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,177
Why can't he just pick me up?

271
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:21,970
It's Watson.

272
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:26,808
"Privileged information, eyes-only,
need-to-know and all that." So...

273
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,190
Okay.

274
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,691
Okay.

275
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:39,655
Nicole.

276
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:41,114
Yeah?

277
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:42,783
Tonight was fun.

278
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,452
Yeah.

279
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,100
Excuse me.

280
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,937
- Is this place far away or close by?
- Far away.

281
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,565
- Hop in the car and I'll take you.
- Thank you.

282
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:29,663
What are you doing?

283
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,456
Move.

284
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,896
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

285
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,612
- Oh, my!
- Sorry.

286
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,200
Did you see that?

287
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,501
What are you doing?

288
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:17,794
Open this door!

289
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,783
Hey, what's going on?

290
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:50,702
Now, mind yourself.

291
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:13,851
Come on.

292
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,109
Wait a minute.

293
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,864
What are you doing?
I haven't even done any...

294
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,038
Say it!

295
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,707
Talk! Where's the boy?

296
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:38,917
Let me out of here
or I'll kick your ass.

297
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:41,712
Speak English! You are hard
to understand!

298
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,673
- You ever hear of police brutality?
- Sounds like fun.

299
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:48,010
One more chance
until you kick the can.

300
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,887
You mean, "kick the bucket."

301
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,097
- What?
- You mean, "kick the bucket."

302
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,765
If you say so.

303
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,727
What kind of music you like?

304
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,855
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:03,442
Just let me out and we can talk
about this, all right?

306
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,695
He's coming on a boat. I don't know
what time. A freighter.

307
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,947
- He'll be coming into the docks.
- A boat!

308
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,116
Look, just let me out of here!

309
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,038
Do you know how long I've been
waiting here for you?

310
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:20,375
What's the matter? You sound like an
obscene phone call.

311
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:21,752
You're out of shape.

312
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,337
You should keep fit.

313
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:26,298
Right, but let's not waste any more
time, shall we?

314
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:32,304
Pier 5. Well, that must be the ship,
if Giscard's telling the truth.

315
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:35,224
Let's hope so.
It's all we've got to go on.

316
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:53,742
Now, these are very
dangerous people, all right?

317
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,035
Do you have a gun?

318
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,496
No, are you going to give me one?

319
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,331
No, get your own bloody gun.

320
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,751
And remember,
I'm head librarian, all right?

321
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,086
- All right?
- Yes.

322
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,257
Right.

323
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:09,633
Here's the plan.

324
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:13,095
I'll circle around to the left.
You circle ar...

325
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:14,888
You circle arou...

326
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,349
And I'll just bloody talk to myself.

327
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,396
Then you go straight through.
Go around.

328
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,232
Welcome, Chosen One.

329
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:34,676
Excuse me.

330
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,306
You're under arrest.

331
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,485
Come on! He went this way!

332
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:07,918
Have you seen him?

333
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:09,878
There.

334
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,387
Watson, come on!

335
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:30,315
Where's the boy?

336
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,234
- We couldn't find him.
- Find him!

337
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:37,656
Shoot him.

338
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,590
You okay?

339
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,974
Go, go, go, go! Get the boy!

340
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,311
Interpol! Freeze!

341
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,622
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.

342
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:27,831
Me, who?

343
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,291
Eddie! Where are you?

344
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,960
I'm trapped inside the container
with the boy.

345
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,463
Stay right where you are.
I'm on my way.

346
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,591
What color is it?

347
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:39,927
I don't know.

348
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:44,765
Watson.

349
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:48,644
- Eddie's in a container.
- Which one?

350
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,313
I have absolutely no idea.

351
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:03,492
There! There!

352
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,035
It's Eddie.

353
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:25,556
Eddie.

354
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,226
Eddie, it's Nicole. Just hang on.

355
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,733
Watson, get over here.
I need your help!

356
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,864
Nicole!

357
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,626
Oh, my God!

358
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,054
Don't be afraid.

359
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,556
I'm not afraid.

360
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:19,943
We'll be all right.

361
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,994
We got control of the container. We
believe that there's bodies inside.

362
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,839
I need an oxygen tank
and a stretcher. Now!

363
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,345
Eddie, please don't leave me, Eddie.

364
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,182
Eddie, come back to me.
Eddie, please.

365
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:15,809
- You all right?
- Please.

366
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,728
Eddie, come back.

367
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:22,482
Nicole...

368
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:26,486
...he's gone.

369
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:38,832
Come on.

370
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,252
God bless, Eddie.

371
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:25,587
God bless.

372
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,050
Nicole.

373
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,969
- We've got work to do.
- You sure?

374
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:33,595
I'm sure.

375
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:35,264
Let's go.

376
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:07,421
I'm sorry...

377
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,343
...I wasn't there when you needed me
most, my friend.

378
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,305
That was nice.

379
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:18,307
Thank you. I...

380
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:23,729
- What's wrong?
- Who are you?

381
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,105
What's the matter?

382
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:27,608
Who are you? What...?

383
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:30,611
What are we doing here?
Where's my clothes?

384
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,114
Watson.

385
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:35,574
Watson.

386
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,084
- Watson!
- Get away from me!

387
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:50,088
It must be fake.

388
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:52,674
Well, it certainly looks like you.

389
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,762
My nose isn't that big.

390
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:02,976
It's really me.

391
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:04,144
Are you sure?

392
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,355
Don't you think I recognize
my own thing?

393
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:08,440
It's cold in here.
Let me take a look.

394
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:12,778
- What's happening to me?
- All right.

395
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,196
Let's just...

396
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,114
...stay calm.

397
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:21,912
I'm sure there's a perfectly rational
explanation for this. Think back.

398
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,706
You were on the boat,
in the container.

399
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:25,958
What happened?

400
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,168
Lights everywhere.

401
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:30,796
- The boy.
- The boy?

402
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:32,756
- Medallion.
- Yes.

403
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:36,176
I have it. It was in your pocket.

404
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:43,392
What's this?

405
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:45,894
Wow.

406
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,041
Where did you go?

407
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:19,595
Excuse me, nurse.

408
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:21,221
We're from Interpol.

409
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:24,516
Would you mind if we have
a few moments with the boy?

410
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:32,232
You know, the man outside
says you're not eating.

411
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,651
You should eat to gain strength.

412
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:55,506
How are you feeling?

413
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:57,633
Feeling. Feel.

414
00:45:57,799 --> 00:45:59,134
Feeling.

415
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,386
Bit bumpy out there
on the ocean waves?

416
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:02,554
Bit rough?

417
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:06,225
Out there?

418
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:15,067
Out there on the high seas?
Bumpity-bumpity?

419
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:20,072
Excuse me. We have to take him
for a checkup now.

420
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,907
Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:27,454
Wait.

422
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,966
I think this belongs to you.

423
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:49,768
Half for me?

424
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,158
Nice lad.

425
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:07,870
You okay?

426
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:09,955
That nurse...

427
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,083
Yeah.

428
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:15,711
Her boots...

429
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,089
No.

430
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:21,133
Her boots.

431
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:23,510
Oh, boots.

432
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,679
Nurses don't wear boots.

433
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:35,147
Watch out!

434
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:43,989
- Get out of my way!
- Sorry.

435
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:46,366
- Get the boy.
- Stop him.

436
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:57,503
What the heck?

437
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:19,691
Give me that!

438
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:28,367
There he goes!

439
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:29,701
Come here.

440
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,829
- I got him. I got him.
- There he is.

441
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,043
He's mine. I've got him.

442
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:30,387
Let's go.

443
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,274
Jai!

444
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:45,652
- Clear all exits.
- Right, sir.

445
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,999
Watson, are you there?

446
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,295
I'm not here.

447
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:08,842
What happened?

448
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:11,220
Snakehead's men.
They were here for the boy.

449
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:15,474
- I'm gonna keep him with me.
- Good idea. Keep him safe. Yes. Yes.

450
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:19,478
Watson, you did all this alone?

451
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,021
No, Eddie is...

452
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:25,817
I mean, I think I mentioned that Eddie
wasn't the only one with a black belt.

453
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:28,403
So you're all right?

454
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:30,489
Perfect.

455
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:34,368
- Great.
- Okay. I'll see you back at the...

456
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:38,830
Yeah. I'm gonna do a couple of
press-ups and meet you back there.

457
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,791
Yes. Yes.

458
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:44,169
You just take care of the boy.

459
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:58,267
- Eddie, listen...
- Watson, something wrong.

460
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:01,520
Snakehead's men got away again,
but at least the boy is safe.

461
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,772
I mean, something wrong with me.

462
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:06,400
Hit me.

463
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:08,694
- What?
- Go on, hit me.

464
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:10,237
No, I can't do that.

465
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:12,030
It's okay, I don't mind.

466
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,615
Well, I mind. I mean...

467
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:15,742
A chap could break
a finger, you know.

468
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,160
Okay.

469
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,371
Use this.

470
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:23,292
- No, thanks. I went before I came out.
- No, hit me with this.

471
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,795
- For real?
- Yes.

472
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,632
God.

473
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:38,557
There you go. All right?

474
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:39,975
Harder.

475
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:42,102
I can't do this. This is ridiculous.

476
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:44,605
- The queen hits harder than that.
- How...

477
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,523
How dare you.

478
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,650
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

479
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:52,571
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, my friend.
Did it hurt?

480
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,281
Of course it hurt.

481
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,116
But nothing.

482
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:58,535
I was shot before...

483
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,329
...but I was okay.

484
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:02,039
Shoot me.

485
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,248
Go ahead.

486
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:06,627
No, I think the embalming fluid
has gone to your head.

487
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,837
- This is ridiculous.
- Give me the gun.

488
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:11,006
- Absolutely not.
- I'll show you.

489
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:15,135
You know how many forms I have to
fill out if I fire my gun? Absolutely not.

490
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:18,055
- This is how accidents happen.
- Look.

491
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:27,814
Amazing.

492
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:33,946
No blood.

493
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,532
Amazing.

494
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:39,952
Incredible.

495
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,287
- See?
- I mean, still...

496
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:47,626
That's incredible. I mean, just...

497
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:58,929
- Stop that.
- I'm sorry.

498
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:01,139
That was below the belt. I'm sorry.

499
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:03,976
That's what I mean.

500
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,568
Can one of you explain
this latest failure?

501
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:15,696
Why you couldn't
retrieve one small boy?

502
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:16,822
Sir...

503
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,157
...this might sound crazy...

504
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:23,287
...but I emptied a whole clip into that
Chinese cop and he still wouldn't die.

505
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:24,621
What Chinese cop?

506
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:27,082
That's Eddie Yang.

507
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:30,586
He's supposed to have died yesterday,
drowned in that container.

508
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:33,755
Then it's true.

509
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:39,428
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

510
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:41,430
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

511
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:43,056
Thank you for being here.

512
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,851
We've come across something
very interesting.

513
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:48,187
Have you ever seen this before?

514
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:51,064
- Doesn't ring a bell. Doctor?
- I've seen that before.

515
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,359
- The fish is the sign of life.
- That's interesting.

516
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:56,695
- And the snake is the sign of...
- Whoa.

517
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:58,655
The medallion.

518
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:00,157
You're gonna love this.

519
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:03,493
Now, it should have a serpent
on one side.

520
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:07,039
And a fish on the other.

521
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,711
If what you have is real, that is
the Holy Grail of Eastern mythology.

522
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:15,297
And maybe the secret to eternal life.

523
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:17,132
Sweet!

524
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:23,889
- Where'd you get the medallion?
- I recognize the fish.

525
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:26,225
- You got it from a kid, didn't you?
- Yes.

526
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,352
The legend says
every thousand years...

527
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,438
...a child is chosen that can bind the
halves together...

528
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:35,526
...and restore life to the dead.
You get that kid and the medallion...

529
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,778
...you're a god.
- That's nonsense.

530
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:39,696
- So where's the other half?
- Wait!

531
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:42,991
The ancient texts say that if you want
superhuman strength...

532
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:45,744
...and immortality,
you need both halves.

533
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:49,039
The only documented case
of a genuine resurrection...

534
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:51,750
You can't weigh it,
measure it, smoke it.

535
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,920
Look, ancient texts aren't fairy tales.

536
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:57,714
Thank you, professor. Doctor. Doctor.

537
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,550
- Cheerio, for now.
- Good luck.

538
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:05,889
Why would a young boy
have something like this?

539
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:10,143
This Snakehead chap, is he
after the medallion or the boy?

540
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:12,563
By the way,
take good care of that kid.

541
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:16,984
The medallion can not only give life,
it can take it away.

542
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:25,492
Okay, I'll cover the front door,
call in for backup.

543
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:28,662
You go to the rear to Nicole's
apartment as fast as you can.

544
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,163
Got it.

545
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:33,709
Sorry.

546
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:04,156
You know, for a little person,
you sure do eat a lot.

547
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:06,867
Still going?

548
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:08,660
What did you have?

549
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:15,125
Okay.

550
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:17,920
Here we go.

551
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:19,463
Try that.

552
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,174
That good?

553
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,345
You don't like... You're not...

554
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,019
One of my culinary skills...

555
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,647
...other than peeling fruit, of course...

556
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:40,234
...just so happens to be a toasted...

557
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:44,238
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich...

558
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:49,576
...which, I might add, Eddie could eat
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

559
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,331
Then again, he didn't really
have any choice.

560
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:58,252
- Why?
- Because I can't cook anything else.

561
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:11,265
I just can't believe
that he's really gone.

562
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,359
He's not gone.

563
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:40,752
Jai...

564
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:44,756
...do you not understand that Eddie's
not coming back?

565
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:46,425
I pulled him back.

566
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:51,263
Okay...

567
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,144
Jai, Eddie's...

568
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:58,312
He...

569
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:07,362
Just hold on.

570
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:16,747
See?

571
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:22,252
Oh, my God.

572
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:23,921
Eddie?

573
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:49,613
Eddie.

574
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:53,700
Jai!

575
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,718
No!

576
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,095
Eddie!

577
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:37,661
You see? I told you he wasn't dead.

578
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:10,068
The boy, sir.

579
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:11,236
Yes.

580
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,379
Welcome...

581
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:31,423
...my old friend.

582
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:40,349
So...

583
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:42,976
...a quick, painless death...

584
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:45,729
...followed by resurrection...

585
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:48,190
...immortality...

586
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,735
...and powers beyond your dreams.

587
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:53,445
Are you sure?

588
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:59,243
His order is ruled
by reverence for life.

589
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,955
My death before him
must be reversed.

590
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:05,958
And if it isn't...

591
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,167
...kill him.

592
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:10,754
And then who would bring you back,
Chosen One?

593
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,501
Pitiful mortal.

594
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,130
So...

595
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:56,967
...I have no further use
for you, Chosen One.

596
01:01:57,551 --> 01:01:58,677
You're not immortal.

597
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:00,304
What?

598
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,016
To become immortal, you need
both halves of the medallion.

599
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,517
Where's the other half?

600
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:08,645
Tell me!

601
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,901
- Nicole.
- Eddie.

602
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:16,945
It's me. I'm fine, really.

603
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:18,447
I just...

604
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:22,242
I still don't understand, Eddie,
because I was there...

605
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:25,662
...and I saw you, and...
- Nicole, it's me.

606
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:29,583
You see, it's just that I was at the
container and you were dead.

607
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,293
I mean, you were dead.

608
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,838
Nicole, the boy uses the medallion
to give life.

609
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,507
That's why Snakehead took him.

610
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:40,093
With the boy and the medallion,
he could...

611
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,221
He could become like you?

612
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:45,224
Yes, but he needs
the whole medallion...

613
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:47,559
...and he only has half.

614
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:50,896
Look...

615
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,524
...this is a touching reunion.

616
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:56,151
We're all glad that Eddie's
amongst the living...

617
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:58,987
...but we still haven't found
Snakehead's helicopter.

618
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:02,324
Get online. Find anything
that was in the air in the last hour.

619
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:05,577
I don't care if it was a bird, a plane
or bloody Superman.

620
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,621
No offense, old chap.

621
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:10,707
Eddie.

622
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:14,253
If he needs the other half, he's
gonna come looking for you.

623
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:19,424
If he is looking for me...

624
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:22,344
...he'll be looking for my partner.

625
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:26,014
Me?

626
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,102
My family.

627
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:31,937
My family.

628
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:40,529
Cool.

629
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:44,533
See, that's not normal. I mean,
that's not natural. What...?

630
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,410
Eddie, take my bike!

631
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:26,867
Thank God.

632
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:28,243
They're all right.

633
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,122
Charlotte?

634
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,875
Charlotte? I have something
I have to tell you.

635
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:36,543
Yes, dear?

636
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,003
Eddie...

637
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:41,673
Watson! They're here!

638
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:47,054
Go!

639
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:53,393
Go!

640
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:58,398
Charlotte, where are you going?

641
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:03,612
This is no time for cleaning.

642
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:08,367
Take your shield!

643
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:12,538
Watson!

644
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:21,213
- Are you all right, love?
- Yes, I'm fine, dear.

645
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:24,007
Catch!

646
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:26,176
Here. I'll lead them away.

647
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,136
Your wife?

648
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:32,891
What the...?

649
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:38,897
There you are. Quick. Quick.
That's a good boy.

650
01:05:39,106 --> 01:05:43,193
Now, listen. Guns are very dangerous
things, all right? Right.

651
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:51,743
How dare you shoot...

652
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:53,996
...at my...

653
01:05:54,162 --> 01:05:55,873
...wife!

654
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:11,096
My Lord.

655
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:25,444
Where'd he go?

656
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,158
We meet again...

657
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:32,409
...Eddie Yang.

658
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,419
Where's the boy?

659
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:45,464
My guest is no concern of yours.

660
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:49,009
All that matters is that you have the
other half of the medallion.

661
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,767
Don't run, Eddie!

662
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:59,019
You can't hide from me!

663
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:09,947
The medallion is mine!

664
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:18,163
You think it's a game?

665
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:19,831
Well, let's play!

666
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,354
We're the same, you and I.

667
01:07:52,614 --> 01:07:54,700
What a pity. What a waste.

668
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:56,869
You don't know
what powers you have.

669
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,480
Destiny calls.

670
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:31,153
He's sleeping. At least, I think that's
what he's doing.

671
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,615
He doesn't even look like he's
breathing.

672
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:35,949
The boy!

673
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:38,327
Oh, God, I wish
you wouldn't do that.

674
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:40,078
Eddie, you're all right.

675
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:42,206
The boy's in danger.

676
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:45,667
He's going to kill him. Right?!

677
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,128
Snakehead has taken the boy
to Raven's Keep.

678
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:49,838
I told you everything I know.

679
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,048
I did.

680
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,925
We need to move fast.

681
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:56,803
Of course I can fly this thing.
I built it myself.

682
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,306
You take the bike.
I'll guide you from the air.

683
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:00,766
I'm driving.

684
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:41,265
That's Raven's Keep.

685
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:43,767
It's five miles away.

686
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,481
You should wash your hands.

687
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:34,735
Come on.

688
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:56,006
Nicole.

689
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:57,966
Be careful.

690
01:10:58,509 --> 01:10:59,510
You too.

691
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:30,541
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Where's the boy?

692
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,335
- Let's get out of here!
- Move!

693
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:16,670
You cowards!

694
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:37,482
Watson. Watson!

695
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:38,901
Are you crazy?

696
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:41,653
Be careful.

697
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,281
Interpol. Freeze.

698
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,501
Jai, are you all right?

699
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:02,216
There she is! Get her!

700
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:20,984
Excuse me.

701
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,240
You looking for something?

702
01:14:04,945 --> 01:14:06,363
Interpol! Freeze!

703
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,158
Interpol! Freeze!

704
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:12,661
Interpol! Free...

705
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,166
Jai, thank God.

706
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,793
You're in danger.

707
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:21,712
It's over.

708
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,380
You're safe now.

709
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:24,756
I don't think so.

710
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:26,550
No, it's all right.

711
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:34,433
Run!

712
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:40,189
For your lives.

713
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:54,119
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

714
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,290
Fetch.

715
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:22,814
My brother...

716
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:25,484
...don't be sentimental.

717
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:28,654
It's so unnecessary.

718
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,030
It's so human.

719
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:31,782
So normal.

720
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:34,159
You and I will live forever.

721
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:36,495
We are the lords of time.

722
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:38,580
We can take whatever we choose.

723
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:45,379
I mean, what difference can a single
human life like hers make to us?

724
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:47,881
We are immortal.

725
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:49,424
Let me show you.

726
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:51,797
Eddie, use the medallion
to end the life that it gave.

727
01:19:34,316 --> 01:19:36,026
Can you?

728
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:40,280
It's your turn.

729
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,130
What's that for?

730
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,091
That, Eddie Yang,
is for not catching me.

731
01:20:49,474 --> 01:20:52,769
And that, Eddie Yang, is for not
catching me.

732
01:20:57,441 --> 01:20:59,109
Interpol! Freeze!

733
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:05,324
Isn't that lovely?

734
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:07,784
Of course...

735
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:10,746
...when he came back, he was naked.

736
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:13,874
I mean, completely starkers.
Not a stitch.

737
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:16,084
I'm not complaining, mind you.

738
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,128
Listen, I have this cough.

739
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:21,590
I think it's quite serious.
Honestly, I could snuff at any point.

740
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:24,551
I don't suppose you'd consider
a rub on your medallion?

741
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,261
I really am. Hello?

742
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:28,639
It's very bad...

743
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:31,934
Very bad. You...

744
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,311
Please, the med... One quick rub.

745
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:36,188
That's all. Oh, the medallion.

746
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,110
Quick. Give me the medallion.

747
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:43,654
Give it.

748
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:48,450
All right.

749
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:51,411
It was only a tickle anyway.

750
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,829
Come with me.

751
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:55,999
Wait!

752
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,210
Nicole! Eddie!

753
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:00,546
You can't leave me here.

754
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:09,721
Goodbye!

755
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:15,185
Okay, that wasn't scary at all.

756
01:22:15,352 --> 01:22:18,897
He walked through a vortex
to the next universe.

757
01:22:19,982 --> 01:22:21,775
I'm going this way.

758
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:36,415
- Quiet on the set. Are cameras ready?
- Cameras are ready.

759
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:38,166
Jackie, Claire. And action.

760
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,334
I'm sorry.

761
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:42,629
Can you overlap
that line for me?

762
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:45,841
Eddie Yang. I knew there
couldn't be two of you.

763
01:22:46,592 --> 01:22:49,845
- Will you say action, or am I just...?
- I did. Okay, here we go.

764
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,305
And action.

765
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:55,559
Three months and not so much
as a phone call?

766
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:58,562
That made me so nervous.
I slapped you so hard.

767
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:01,064
- Come on! Oh, my God!
- In the middle...!

768
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:03,734
- I got slapped for nothing!
- I'm so sorry.

769
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:07,196
- I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- I can't believe it.

770
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:08,822
- Oh, no!
- Claire.

771
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,950
Jackie, I'm so sorry.
That rea... That hurt me.

772
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,787
- You should continue filming!
- Oh, I didn't know!

773
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:18,832
- Now I got another one!
- Oh, no!

774
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,210
- That was really bad.
- Try it again.

775
01:23:21,919 --> 01:23:22,920
Let's go.

776
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:24,922
Let's move.

777
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,549
Take one.

778
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:28,884
Eddie.

779
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:32,221
All those things that I said...

780
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:36,141
I was right there.

781
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:37,434
- Seven, take three.

782
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:39,728
God bless, Eddie.

783
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,823
Action!

784
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:55,953
Cut!

785
01:23:57,037 --> 01:23:57,996
Cut.

786
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,123
Take one.

787
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:02,376
You... Now, how...?

788
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,044
It's Giscard.

789
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:08,173
- Really? What about Snakehead?
- Snakehead is not here yet.

790
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,592
Is he not here?
What about Ken?

791
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:12,469
- Yeah. Ken is...
- Pete? Pete?

792
01:24:12,636 --> 01:24:14,972
Pete is just right beside me.

793
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:16,348
That's it. We're fine.

794
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,936
- Now, that's...
- Somebody let Jackie in.

795
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:24,690
Here's the plan.

796
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:25,858
We have to...

797
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:27,818
Whoops.

798
01:24:28,026 --> 01:24:29,278
I got it wrong.

799
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:34,366
It's this way.

800
01:24:35,868 --> 01:24:38,161
Oh, sorry. It's the other way.

801
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:40,664
Oh, damn.

802
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:42,374
Oh, I missed.

803
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:45,043
Watson.

804
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:48,255
- Cut. Print.
- Phone.

805
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:49,715
- A-camera.
- Action.

806
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:52,342
Watson. So many things are going on.

807
01:24:55,554 --> 01:24:57,472
- Marker.
- Come on.

808
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:00,017
- Marker.
- One more.

809
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:02,477
Watson.

810
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:05,230
Sorry. What? It's... No, you... No.

811
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:06,440
- Again.
- Sorry.

812
01:25:06,607 --> 01:25:07,733
Marker!

813
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:14,281
- Cut.
- Cut!

814
01:25:16,617 --> 01:25:17,993
I want ice cream.

815
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:28,629
Cut!

816
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:29,796
Cut!

817
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,925
Slate X67, take one coming up.

818
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:35,427
- A-marker.
- Like a woman.

819
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,138
That's it. That's it. Okay.

820
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:41,058
It's just down there.

821
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:42,643
Down.

822
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,436
Then the bottom.

823
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:46,146
Then the bottom.

824
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:50,859
- Sorry, Jackie.
- What's this? "The bottom."

825
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:53,654
- Marker.
- Move!

826
01:25:58,534 --> 01:25:59,576
Wait, wait!

827
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:07,167
Oh, shit.

828
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:09,878
Nicole, the boy used the meda...

829
01:26:10,546 --> 01:26:12,172
Very good. Cut. Cut.

830
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,468
The dog barking.

831
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:17,803
Yeah, I heard it.

832
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,555
Go. Go away.

833
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:21,431
And action.

834
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,267
Interpol! Freeze!

835
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:24,434
Cut.

836
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:27,271
A-camera.

837
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:29,481
In case of emergency...

838
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:31,984
...the exits are here...

839
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:33,318
...here...

840
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:35,612
...and here.

841
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:41,994
- I slapped you.
- Again.

842
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:44,204
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!

843
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:46,790
- It was meant to be fake. Sorry.
- You do on purpose.

844
01:26:46,957 --> 01:26:48,250
Are you doing on purpose?

845
01:26:48,417 --> 01:26:50,335
Try it again, Claire.
A little harder.

846
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:51,587
It drives me crazy.
