1
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,373
I'd like another shot
at that prize money.

2
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:08,911
- Okay for next Sunday?
- No, Jim. It ain't okay.

3
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:11,999
- Now, look, Bice...
- No, you look.

4
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:14,338
All of my drivers
are 18, 19.

5
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:17,089
You're too old
for these kid snorts.

6
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,213
You're liable
to get hurt in there.

7
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:23,132
You used to be a big track driver.
Ain't you got no pride?

8
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,769
I ran out of pride
when I ran out of cars.

9
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:29,140
Jim, you gotta look
at yourself.

10
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,360
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks,
you think you're on your way.

11
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:35,322
But it didn't
work out, did it?

12
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,159
- Much obliged.
- You need any money?

13
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,668
Nope.

14
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,548
Hey.

15
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:54,130
What do you do
with this stuff?

16
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,835
It's for a friend.

17
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:02,307
Hey! How'd it go?

18
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,311
Okay.

19
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,144
- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.

20
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,601
Aw, the poor thing.

21
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:11,610
I'll find a good spot for it.

22
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,815
- You got hurt again.
- So?

23
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,523
One of these days you're
gonna get wiped out entirely.

24
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,703
Why you gotta be a driver?

25
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,453
Maybe that's not
your thing, racing.

26
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:25,585
How about all those car agencies
down on Van Ness?

27
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:28,583
I bet a top mechanic there
gets a lot of good bread laid on him.

28
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:30,590
What is the matter
with everybody?

29
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:32,592
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic, I'm a driver.

30
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,259
I know just how you feel, Jim.

31
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,427
Hey, I used to think I was
happy painting flower seeds.

32
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,558
Then one day, inside me,
this little voice says,

33
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,848
"Tennessee Steinmetz."

34
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,021
I said, "What?"
It said, "You ain't happy."

35
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:52,484
Tennessee, why is it the only thing
we have in this house is parrot food?

36
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:56,201
- I mean, we don't have a parrot.
- Eat that. That's good.

37
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,415
That's pressed kelp.
That aerates your liver.

38
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:02,543
Then this voice inside
of me continued as follows:

39
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,371
"This is nowhere.
Ya gotta make a new scene.

40
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,880
Ya gotta change your bag."

41
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,169
That's when I split.
I went to Tibet,

42
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:15,173
to a mountaintop,
with swamis and monks.

43
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:18,975
I discovered my real self.

44
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:21,063
It was wonderful.

45
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:24,892
I don't have
to go to Tibet.

46
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:27,068
I know who I am.

47
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,526
I know what I want.

48
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,243
There are dirt track races at a carnival
near Bakersfield this week.

49
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:37,742
If I can get over there
I can pick up a couple of bucks.
Okay to use your wheels?

50
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:41,495
Okay, but you're gonna have
a little trouble getting it started.

51
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,587
Where's the beast?

52
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:49,169
You didn't
cut up the Edsel.

53
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,095
It came over me
all of a sudden.

54
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,184
It was the only
decent thing to do.

55
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,981
Believe me, Jim,
it'll be happier up there.

56
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,983
[Laughing]

57
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:40,813
[No Audio]

58
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,541
Are you all right?
Are you dizzy?

59
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,160
Oh, no. There's a slight
racking pain in my head here.

60
00:06:57,297 --> 00:07:01,924
Oh, well, I think you'd better sit down.
I'm really terribly sorry.

61
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:04,259
Well, it's not your fault.
I didn't mean to startle you.

62
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:07,555
Looks like you've been running
into all sorts of things lately.

63
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:11,100
Yeah. Oh, this
is just a little...

64
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,727
- Oh, lady.
- [Chuckling] Oh, really, sir.

65
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:20,435
Excuse me.

66
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,823
Over 400 cubes.

67
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:31,741
Dual quads, all synchro box,
zero to 60 under five.

68
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:34,629
All right, Miss Bennett.
I'll see to this gentleman myself.

69
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,507
May I be of service, sir?

70
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:41,050
I see that you're a person
who appreciates fine things.

71
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:44,097
You're no doubt aware that this
is the celebrated Thorndyke special.

72
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:46,597
Allow me to say, sir,

73
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,764
that I think this car
would suit you very well.

74
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,771
Yes.
Yes, it would.

75
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,767
- May I offer you a glass
of sherry and a biscuit?
- Go right ahead.

76
00:07:55,904 --> 00:08:00,946
I take it the question of price
does not greatly concern
a gentleman like yourself.

77
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,986
Oh, I wouldn't haggle
if that's what you mean.

78
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,493
What price range
did you have in mind?

79
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,415
About $75.

80
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:11,670
$75.
[Laughs]

81
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:14,169
I could go 80 in a pinch.
What do you have in the way of
cheap, honest transportation?

82
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:16,969
Cheap, honest transportation!

83
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,348
I will bid you good day, sir.

84
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:25,516
Good day.

85
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,934
Hey!

86
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,188
Havershaw!

87
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:34,065
Now, where did
this come from?

88
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:38,028
- Mr Thorndyke, yes, sir?
- What is this thing
doing in my showroom?

89
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,365
I believe Miss Bennett
may know something about this.

90
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:44,623
Yes. You remember when Mrs van Luit
purchased her new Bentley?

91
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:48,035
She also requested us to buy
a small used car for her upstairs maid.

92
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,788
Then why isn't her upstairs maid
in her blasted vehicle?

93
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,798
The car was returned
this morning, Mr Thorndyke.

94
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,298
She was having some kind
of difficulty with it.

95
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,303
- Get it out of here!
- Yes, sir.

96
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:01,884
What's that for?

97
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:06,348
- I beg your pardon?
- Why don't you let the little car alone?

98
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:10,349
Are you presuming to tell me
what to do in my own establishment?

99
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:12,811
Okay, I'm out of line.

100
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:15,272
It just bugs me to see somebody
abusing a decent piece of machinery.

101
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:18,908
[Laughing] How fascinating.
Well, now that we've had the
benefit of your point of view,

102
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,279
shall we regard our relationship
as terminated?

103
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,867
Havershaw!
Get this eyesore out of my showroom.

104
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:26,876
And if ever I find it here again,

105
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:29,756
someone is going to find himself
in a great deal of trouble!

106
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,338
Yes, sir. Of course.
Boys, here we go.

107
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:35,304
Here we go.
[Grunting]

108
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:41,518
- Sorry. None of my business, is it?
- Perfectly all right.

109
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:45,691
- Goodbye.
- Oh. Goodbye.

110
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:59,158
[Bell Ringing]

111
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,210
[Ringing Continues]

112
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,893
[Buzzing]

113
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,686
- Good morning.
- Good morning. What do you want?

114
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:31,903
- Police.
- Right. What do you want?

115
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:35,654
Forgive me for pointing,
but have you ever seen that car before?

116
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:40,582
- No. No, I haven't.
- Hey, he's a cute little fella.

117
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,455
Hey, wait a minute.

118
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:47,465
Wait a minute. I think I saw
that car at an agency yesterday.

119
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:50,264
Now, permit to inform
you of the following:

120
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:55,846
First, say nothing that would
jeopardize your constitutional rights.

121
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,600
Second, the minute
you get downtown,

122
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:01,767
I would advise
you get a good lawyer.

123
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,610
- Shall we go?
- Go? What for?

124
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:10,441
On suspicion of grand theft.

125
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:15,121
Now, wait a minute.
There's something cockeyed about this.

126
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:17,123
How did that little
car get here?

127
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:22,246
I share your curiosity.
Shall we go?

128
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,253
[Laughing]

129
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,379
I'll do it.
Okay, I'll do it.

130
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:33,976
But I want to go on record. I have seen
some crummy stunts used to sell cars,

131
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:36,262
but this beats everything.

132
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,971
To plant this Bug
in the possession of an innocent man
and accuse me of stealing it!

133
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:40,983
How dare you, sir!

134
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,068
Are you suggesting I would
stoop to such tactics?

135
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:45,320
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting!

136
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:48,616
In the first place, it might
interest you to know that
under normal circumstances,

137
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:51,070
I would never sell a car
to someone with whom I'm not,

138
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:53,827
shall we say,
socially compatible.

139
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,998
- You'd sell a car...
- Please! Let's not
go through that again.

140
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:58,037
I think we've worked
it out very well.

141
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,663
Mr Douglas needs a car,
and for a very low amount down...

142
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,964
and the usual monthly payments,
the car will become his.

143
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:08,845
Very well, even though my inclination
is to have Mr Douglas clapped into jail,

144
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:11,217
and this four-wheeled contrivance
dropped into the bay!

145
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:16,181
- I think Mr Thorndyke
is being very fair.
- Fair? It's not fair!

146
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:19,235
I'm being muscled! I want you to know
that I know it and I don't like it!

147
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:20,940
[Miss Bennett]
I'll draw up the papers.

148
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:24,323
Would you come
with me, please?

149
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,823
Then get Mr Douglas
and his acquisition out of here...

150
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,112
before I lose my temper!

151
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,415
- [Liquid Squirting]
- What in...

152
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:19,379
What's the matter?
You from L.A. Or something?

153
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,386
[Tyres Screeching]

154
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,939
- I thought we'd run over to that
new restaurant in Marin County.
- [Tyres Screeching]

155
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,666
Have you gone mad?

156
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,465
Okay.
What's the joke?

157
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,879
- What do you mean?
- I don't know how you rigged it,

158
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:58,461
- but I'm sure that car's a real cutup
when a convention comes to town.
- What in the name...

159
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:00,755
If I'd wanted a trick car
I would have bought one in a joke shop.

160
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:03,975
Allow me to say I haven't the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

161
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:06,558
You come blithering up in
that beastly little car...

162
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,931
and assault
my personal Rolls Royce!

163
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:10,940
I brought it back.

164
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:13,192
I want my money,
I want the papers I signed,

165
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,904
then I'll get out and you two clowns
can have your little laugh.

166
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:19,489
Mr Douglas, if there is
anything wrong with the car,

167
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,538
would you be good enough
to tell me what it is?

168
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:26,580
It's just that that it wants to go
one way and I'd like to go the other.

169
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:30,958
- Whatever it is, none of it
is covered in our guarantee.
- I'm sure of that.

170
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,128
- If you examine paragraph 12...
- Excuse me, Mr Thorndyke.

171
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:38,010
If I sold this gentleman the car
I feel a certain responsibility.

172
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,846
Do you mind if I try it?

173
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:48,693
Miss Bennett!
Our dinner engagement.

174
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,693
I won't be a minute.

00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:57,109
Seems to be acting
all right now.

176
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:01,872
Sometimes new car owners have a tendency
to exaggerate their problems.

177
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,077
We get that all the time.

178
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:06,749
Believe me, when I was
in this car alone...

179
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:10,499
Just treat it gently at first.
It really is a fine automobile.

of his payments off his back.
- No doubt.

that's a good idea?

Well, if Mr Douglas
entered the race,

422
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:03,336

against the remaining payments.

492
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:25,700
No, he's done something to it,

493
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,821
and I've got to find out what!

494
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:29,830
You've become obsessed
by this whole thing.

495
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:33,791
There are other cars, other races.
Why don't you just forget it?

496
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:39,836
My dear child,
how little you know me.

497
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:43,718
- Yes, Mr Thorndyke.
- Carole?

498
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,681
- How long have you been with us?
- A year and a half, almost two. Why?

499
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:49,935
I'm afraid I've been
a little remiss...

500
00:39:50,064 --> 00:39:53,896
in not telling you before now how very
well you've proved in all your duties.

501
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,901
Well, thank you.

502
00:39:56,029 --> 00:40:00,157
And, Carole, as I realize
you have the best interests
of this organization at heart,

503
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:03,119
I want you to accede
to a somewhat unusual request.

504
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:06,864
- Oh?
- [Phone Ringing]

505
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,325
Peter Thorndyke.

506
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,500
It's for you.

507
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,919
All right.
You can take it here.

508
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:15,923
Thank you.

509
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:17,925
Yes, good afternoon.

510
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:23,800
Oh, I think that
should be quite all right.

511
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,509
Uh, 7:30 will be fine.

512
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:29,138
Yes. Uh, bye.

513
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:32,145
- I think I'll...
- I'd like you to see this Douglas,
get to know him.

514
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:35,148
Who knows? If he has the talents
of which I believe him capable,

515
00:40:35,281 --> 00:40:37,155
perhaps we can give him
the opportunity...

516
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:39,193
of joining our organization,
racing under our colours.

517
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:42,032
- But first, we must know
something about him.
- How about tonight?

518
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:44,073
- Very good.
- At 7:30?

519
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:47,125
Very good!
Why waste time?

520
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:49,292
Oh, and Carole,
another thing.

521
00:40:49,422 --> 00:40:52,790
Leave your car. Take the Special.
He likes that one.

522
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:56,839
Uh, thank you.
[Laughs]

523
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,509
I think I ought to tell you that
that was Mr Douglas who just called.

524
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,764
Excellent.
Strike while the iron is hot.

525
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,099
In all honesty,
I should like to point out...

526
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:07,183
that I agreed to have dinner with him
before you suggested it.

527
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:09,558
I salute your honesty, my dear...

528
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:12,944
a quality not necessarily
to be despised.

529
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:16,239
Thank you.

530
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,609
A very loyal girl.

531
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,662
[Whistling]

532
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,290
- Got Herbie all polished out for ya.
- Uh, Carole Bennett called back.

533
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:29,120
- She's going to pick me up
in the Special.
- You're not takin' Herbie?

534
00:41:29,257 --> 00:41:32,174
He's looking forward to some relaxation
just like you are.

535
00:41:32,302 --> 00:41:34,211
- The car is...
- [Horn Honking]

536
00:41:34,346 --> 00:41:38,296
- See you later, Tennessee.
- Some thanks
after what Herbie did for you.

537
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:48,558
Don't let it get ya, Herbie.
Jim didn't mean it.

538
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:50,937
Don't forget: He isn't the first guy
ever to lose his head...

539
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:52,947
over a bucket seat
and a paint job.

540
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:57,287
- He'll come to his senses.
- [Buzzer Buzzing]

541
00:41:57,413 --> 00:42:00,948
- Good evening.
- Sorry. The other rats
are out for the evening!

542
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:03,657
No, no! Please.
I didn't come by to see Mr Douglas.

543
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:08,173
- I came by to pay my respects
to that gallant little car.
- Huh?

544
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,005
There it is.

545
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:14,423
- What a marvel it is, indeed.
- I don't get you, fella.

546
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:18,057
Oh, come, come, sir. I know
a rare bit of machinery when I see one.

547
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:20,475
And after all,
who should know it better than I?

548
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:24,105
I, who have been trounced
time and again by this... this paragon.

549
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:26,108
You'll forgive me
for saying so, sir,

550
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:29,653
but it does take class to know
when it has been defeated by class.

551
00:42:29,782 --> 00:42:33,946
You know somethin', Mr Thorndyke?
I may have misjudged you.

552
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,124
- Well, thank you.
- I've been misjudging
a lot of people lately.

553
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,623
Would you like a drink?
Some Irish coffee?

554
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:42,876
Specialty of the house.
My own mother's recipe.

555
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:46,007
- That's very kind of you.
I'd love it. Thank you.
- I'll be back in a jiffy!

556
00:42:46,134 --> 00:42:48,969
That's most kind.
Thank you so much.

557
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:54,173
It's just incredible, isn't it, to think
that this innocent-seeming object...

558
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:58,723
is, is capable
of such great deeds.

559
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:03,068
- [Blowtorch Hissing]
- How, indeed. [Chuckles]

560
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:06,065
The trick is, always remember
to have asbestos gloves...

561
00:43:06,198 --> 00:43:08,570
when you make coffee this way.

562
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:10,575
Fascinating. Yes.

563
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:12,862
Yes. Quite...
Quite fascinating.

564
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:23,626
- Here we go.
- [Muffled Groans]

565
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:29,421
[Strained Chuckle]
Oh. How very refreshing.

566
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:32,261
Oh, thank you.

567
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:36,557
- Up the Irish.
- To the little car, a gallant adversary.

568
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:40,557
- And may the best car win at Riverside.
- May the best car win.

569
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,739
Oh, that's very good, isn't it?
Very good, indeed.

570
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:57,329
- Like it?
- What do you think?

571
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:03,125
I can't stand that hungry look
any longer.

572
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,300
[Chuckles]
Take over.

573
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:12,306
You know what I said to myself
the first time I saw you?

574
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:16,352
- What?
- I said to myself,
"Now, there's a real lady."

575
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:24,986
This is how it ought to be...
me and these kind of wheels.

576
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:28,867
Excuse me asking, but aren't you
doing all right with the little car?

577
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:33,874
Sure, but can you imagine how
I'd make it with equipment like this?

578
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:37,586
Is it so important to you?

579
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:41,215
Without a real car,
I'm only half a man.

580
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,142
What part of Ireland did you say
your mother came from?

581
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:54,725
Coney Ireland.
[Laughing]

582
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,856
I'm going to make some more coffee.
[Laughing]

583
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:02,149
[Laughing Continues]

584
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,020
[Liquid Sloshing]

585
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:37,729
- [Laughs]
- Oh, uh, would you like a spot of this?

586
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:41,033
- I like a spot of anything.
- I'm so sorry.

587
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,284
- Now, we're gonna drink to Herbie,
- [Laughs]

588
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:46,201
- The greatest little car
in the whole world.
- Yes. Quite right.

589
00:45:46,334 --> 00:45:49,335
- Mm-hmm.
- Hear, hear. Hear, hear. [Sniffs]

590
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:52,415
- To Herbie.
- To Herbie. So sorry about your hand.

591
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:55,121
I do apologize.
To Herbie.

592
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,679
What do you know?
The engine stalled.

593
00:46:04,353 --> 00:46:06,595
How about that?
The door's stuck.

594
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,598
- Mmm.
- That's how it is with cars sometimes.

595
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:14,234
- Yes.
- I guess we'll have to wait
and see what happens next.

596
00:46:14,364 --> 00:46:17,448
Well, as someone
very wisely once said,

597
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:20,612
"That's how it is
with cars sometimes."

598
00:46:20,746 --> 00:46:24,162
- I just said that.
- Oh.

599
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:31,048
I wonder if your reputation
is altogether true.

600
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:33,333
What's my reputation?

601
00:46:33,468 --> 00:46:37,549
Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas is only
interested in fast cars and easy money.

602
00:46:37,681 --> 00:46:39,555
Not true.

603
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:41,593
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:43,970
- You know something else?
- What?

605
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:46,941
When the light
hits you just right,

606
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:50,187
you're as beautiful
as General Grant on a $50 bill.

607
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:04,083
[Mutters]
Oh, dear me.

608
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:06,168
[Panting]

609
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:11,416
You wanna know the secret
of the little car?

610
00:47:11,552 --> 00:47:14,126
I do, indeed.

611
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,013
- I'll tell ya
the secret of the little car.
- No, no, no. Just a minute.

612
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:22,637
All right. Tell me.

613
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,229
It's heart.

614
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,898
That's what it is: Heart.

615
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:31,404
Heart. Yes.

616
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:35,068
Well, I'm certainly going
to make a note of that.

617
00:47:40,918 --> 00:47:43,624
- [Engines Revving]
- [Crowd Chattering]

618
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:47,880
- Headache gone?
- All gone.

619
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,711
Anticipation of victory
is the purest form of aspirin.

620
00:47:51,847 --> 00:47:57,055
- This is my day.
- [Announcer] Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.

621
00:47:57,187 --> 00:48:01,434
- You seem very confident.
- You know, I believe I am.

622
00:48:07,281 --> 00:48:12,407
[Announcer] They leave the
starting grid, going into turn one.

623
00:48:12,537 --> 00:48:14,411
The field's stretching out now.

624
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:19,201
Everybody getting through
turn one very nicely.

625
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:22,206
Very fine field of cars here.

626
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:26,752
And coming through traffic now, making a
move, is Peter Thorndyke in the #14 car.

627
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:28,759
Picking up a few cars
in that turn.

628
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:32,471
Now he comes by and picks up three
more cars, going into the lead now.

629
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,978
Thorndyke leading this race
in car #14.

630
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:39,264
Now making a move
is car #53, Douglas,

631
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:43,267
who also picks up about three cars
as he goes charging through traffic...

632
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:47,781
and is in hot pursuit
of Thorndyke in the #14 car.

633
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:51,278
As they go down the back straight,
comin' on pretty hard and fast...

634
00:48:51,413 --> 00:48:55,031
is car #53 making the pass.

635
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,705
Attaway, Jimmy boy!

636
00:48:57,836 --> 00:49:00,791
Go, Jimmy!
[Laughing]

637
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:07,712
So far, Jim Douglas seems to have
everything pretty much to himself.

638
00:49:07,848 --> 00:49:10,718
He comes through the S's
into turn six well in control...

639
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,185
[Herbie Sputtering]

640
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,775
[Herbie Burping]

641
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,570
[Burping Continues]

642
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:31,789
As they come down the back straight,
Douglas is slowing down...

643
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:35,285
and Thorndyke goes rocketing by
into the sweeper turn.

644
00:49:38,173 --> 00:49:40,415
It looks as though the Douglas car
is having trouble.

645
00:49:40,551 --> 00:49:43,671
Yes, #53 is fading fast.

646
00:49:43,804 --> 00:49:46,474
It is developing a problem
of some kind.

647
00:49:49,894 --> 00:49:51,686
[Tyres Screeching]

648
00:49:53,565 --> 00:49:56,685
Come in! Come in!

649
00:49:56,819 --> 00:50:00,484
- [Sputtering]
- Come in!

650
00:50:05,996 --> 00:50:08,035
Irish coffee.

651
00:50:08,165 --> 00:50:11,166

[Photographers Shouting,
Crowd Cheering]

1318
01:45:18,495 --> 01:45:21,746
Do what? Kiss?
You better believe it. Come here.

1320
01:45:39,184 --> 01:45:42,518
"Couldn't lose,"
I think you said.

1321
01:45:42,646 --> 01:45:45,897
I don't like to remind you, sir,
but if only you'd read the terms...

1322
01:45:46,025 --> 01:45:48,232
of that stupid wager
you made with Mr Wu...

1323
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:51,232
Havershaw, you're despicable.

1324
01:45:52,866 --> 01:45:56,235
[Laughing]

1325
01:45:58,289 --> 01:46:01,206
Havershaw, I shan't pretend
that I don't know what you're thinking.

1326
01:46:01,334 --> 01:46:05,462
However, I pride myself
on being a good judge of character.

1327
01:46:05,588 --> 01:46:11,010
And when I ask myself,
"Could this man be capable
of such an act of pettiness and...

1328
01:46:12,846 --> 01:46:15,254
base ingratitude..."

1329
01:46:15,391 --> 01:46:17,763
I accept that as your answer.

[Laughs, Shrieks]

1331
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:29,822
- Thanks, Herbie. So long, Mr Wu.
- Goodbye.

1332
01:46:29,949 --> 01:46:31,823
- Goodbye, Mr Wu.
- Bye, Tennessee.

1333
01:46:31,951 --> 01:46:34,193
So long, Jim.

1334
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:37,449
It's none of my business, but where
are you going on your honeymoon?

1335
01:46:37,582 --> 01:46:40,453
We don't know.
Herb hasn't told us yet.

1336
01:46:40,586 --> 01:46:43,124
- [Door Closes]
- Let's go, Herb.

1337
01:46:46,134 --> 01:46:48,340
Goodbye, Herbie.
