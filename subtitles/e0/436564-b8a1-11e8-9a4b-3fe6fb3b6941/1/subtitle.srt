1
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,442
Mr. Taransky...?

2
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,319
She's...

3
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,488
She's walking?

4
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,490
Don't tell me
she's walking.

5
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,325
She can't walk.

6
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,288
- Nicola!
- This, this...

7
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,665
- not this.
- Nicola!

8
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,834
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.

9
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,169
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?

10
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,838
Because I made
the changes,

11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,673
all the changes
you wanted.

12
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,134
You are virtually
in every scene.

13
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,178
It is not the size
of the role, Viktor.

14
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,806
Am I, or am I not
entitled

15
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,684
to the biggest trailer
on the lot? Hmm?

16
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,978
It's the biggest
on earth.

17
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,813
I swear.

18
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,690
It's a 50-foot
Airstream.

19
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,692
They don't make them
any longer.

20
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,027
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?

21
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,696
- Taller!
- What?

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,614
Eh.

23
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,369
You've insulted me
for the last time.

24
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,329
You're right.
It's actually--

25
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,289
It's actually taller.

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,291
- You're right. It's amazing.
- Coffee!

27
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,418
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,004
The tires are
overinflated.

29
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,006
See? It's just this.

30
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,635
See? Look. Here.

31
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,679
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.

32
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,639
See? It's lower already.

33
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,975
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.

34
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,311
You know,
I had three other offers.

35
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,313
I only signed on
to this picture...

36
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,149
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.

37
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,734
They're going
to shut me down!

38
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,652
It's not working, Viktor.

39
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,488
I mean, my God!

40
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,823
The scene
with the thousand geese?!

41
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,992
I don't understand
this film!

42
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,120
Nobody is going
to understand this film.

43
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,040
I already put out a press release
citing creative differences.

44
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,042
So just let it go.

45
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,002
You went to the press?

46
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,921
Do we have everything?

47
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,798
All right.
You know what?

48
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,257
You're right.

49
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,968
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.

50
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,096
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.

51
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,931
'Cause you oughta go.

52
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,933
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.

53
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,935
This film doesn't
deserve you.

54
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,313
It deserves much,
much better than you!

55
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,940
Creative differences?

56
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,109
The difference is
you're not creative.

57
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,616
To hell, please.

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,340
Jack?

59
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,802
Jack, are you there?

60
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,470
She's good.

61
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,515
You can hardly tell
she's reading off a teleprompter.

62
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,975
I'm right here.

63
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,936
Right beside you.

64
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:52,732
Look.

65
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,610
I've analyzed this footage.

66
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,113
We've got everything
we need in the can already.

67
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,407
If I could just make
the proper adjustments,

68
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,660
we can finish
this film without her.

69
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,663
Viktor, according to the writ
her attorneys filed at noon today,

70
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,208
they'll sue if the film is released
with Nicola in a single frame.

71
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,502
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.

72
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,920
So let's recast.

73
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,298
Nicola Anders is
the only actress in the world

74
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,591
that could play that part.

75
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,634
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.

76
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,845
Nicola Anders is not
bigger than this picture.

77
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,222
Of course she is, Viktor.

78
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,183
No other name is going
to sign on now.

79
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,810
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.

80
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,937
I'm not going to play
opposite an unknown.

81
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,815
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.

82
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,985
If we ever want to be in
the Nicola Anders business again,

83
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
we have to cut our losses
and shelve the picture.

84
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,114
No!

85
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,283
I will not give in to that
blackmailing--

86
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,035
Viktor,
let's take a walk.

87
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,870
Ridiculous performance.

88
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,747
I told you she was bad.

89
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,582
No, yours in there.

90
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,835
Why do you always have to make
things so difficult for yourself?

91
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,421
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?

92
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,006
Yes. Mm-hmm.

93
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,219
Elaine, do you know
what these are?

94
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,387
Mike 'n' Ike's?

95
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,014
They're not just any
Mike 'n' Ike's,

96
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,557
These are cherry
Mike 'n' Ike's.

97
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,935
Do you know why I,
Viktor Taransky,

98
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,104
two-time Academy Award
nominated director--

99
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,064
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."

100
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,484
--overseeing the most cherished
movie project of my entire career,

101
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,444
am walking around with--
look, look, look...

102
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,446
pockets full
of these... things?!

103
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,698
I have a feeling
you're going to tell me.

104
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,244
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders,

105
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,287
supermodel
with a SAG card,

106
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,540
has it written
in her contract

107
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,500
that all cherry
Mike 'n' Ike's

108
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,127
be removed
from her candy dish,

109
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,422
along with strict instructions
that any room she walks into

110
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,133
must have seven packs
of cigarettes waiting for her--

111
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,551
three of them opened;

112
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,137
that there be
a personal Jacuzzi

113
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,639
within 80 paces
of her dressing room;

114
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,641
and that any time
she travels,

115
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,060
her nanny must fly
with her first-class.

116
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,062
So, what's wrong
with that?

117
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,897
Elaine, she doesn't
have children.

118
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,358
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.

119
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,485
They're mocking--
we're at their mercy.

120
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,530
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars,

121
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,907
but they used to be
our stars, remember?

122
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,243
We were the ones who would
tell them what to do.

123
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,078
And we would tell them
what to wear,

124
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,080
- who to date--
- That's what you want?!

125
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,749
When they
were under contract to us,

126
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,251
we could change their names
if we wanted to.

127
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,753
- More than once.
- Viktor,

128
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,379
do you realize
you're nostalgic

129
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,298
for an era you weren't
even born in?!

130
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,800
I do remember why I got
into this business.

131
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,845
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please. Come on.

132
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,930
New York-- Cassavetes.
Remember?

133
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,766
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?

134
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,893
We were trying to make
something important.

135
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,060
I don't know.

136
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,563
Shine a little light
in that darkened cinema.

137
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,356
It's called a projector.

138
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,734
Illuminate hearts and minds
with a ray of truth.

139
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,652
I thought that's
what we were doing.

140
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,114
I have good memories
of those days, too.

141
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,200
I do, but this isn't
about that--

142
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,409
or you, or me,

143
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,745
or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.

144
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,246
- Spare me.
- Look around.

145
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,248
Who do you think pays
for all of this?

146
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,042
This is about investment
and return.

147
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,794
I'm not interested
in investment and return!

148
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm not interested
in who pays for anything!

149
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,881
I'm trying to make a movie!

150
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,634
I'm responsible
for this, Viktor.

151
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,427
Those days
in New York...

152
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,723
It's over, Viktor.

153
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,648
You're not renewing
my contract?

154
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,650
How can I?!

155
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,820
Your last three pictures tanked.

156
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,239
No bankable star is going
to work with you after this.

157
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,741
I mean, if you just
compromised a little.

158
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,705
Well, it's not every day
you're fired

159
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,582
by the mother
of your own child.

160
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,712
You and I both know
that I kept you on

161
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,257
after the divorce
for old time's sake.

162
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,427
And so you could still hold
your head up in front of Lainey.

163
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,263
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...

164
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,690
I'm sorry, Viktor.

165
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,717
Dad!

166
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,596
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.

167
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,891
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

168
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,894
I'm sorry Mom canned you.

169
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,647
I'm going to finish
this picture.

170
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,108
Lainey, I'm going
to finish it.

171
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,904
Because it's important.

172
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,157
I know you will, Dad.

173
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,075
You're Viktor Taransky.

174
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm Viktor Taransky.

175
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,833
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.

176
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,383
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.

177
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,927
Are you okay?

178
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,221
I'm Viktor Taransky.

179
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,027
Mr. Taransky?

180
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,904
Mr. Taransky,
thank God.

181
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,197
I've been trying
to see you.

182
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,366
I've been calling.

183
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,409
Your assistant
won't put me through.

184
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,662
I told her it was a matter
of life and death.

185
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,206
I was afraid I wasn't going
to get to you in time.

186
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,417
Please, just...

187
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,377
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!

188
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,378
I did it!

189
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,422
I licked skin,
I licked hair,

190
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,633
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.

191
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,718
I'll call security
if you don't back off.

192
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,221
I have her,
Mr. Taransky.

193
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,348
The answer
to your prayers.

194
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,726
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.

195
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,937
I have your new leading-lady
right here.

196
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,565
In my pants.

197
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,777
Please, sir,
I don't know you.

198
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,072
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!

199
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,074
Mr. Taransky, don't--

200
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,784
Don't you recognize me?

201
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,246
The Future of Film Conference
in San Jose.

202
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,206
Remember that?
Hank.

203
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,292
Hank Aleno.

204
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,586
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.

205
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,713
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.

206
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,924
You were booed off
the stage.

207
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,927
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.

208
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,221
And that whole time
I never left my computer.

209
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,265
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.

210
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,058
Well, it's good
and bad.

211
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,060
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.

212
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,897
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.

213
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,815
Don't be,
because it was worth it.

214
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,444
You have to see her.

215
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,237
Oh, I've seen those.

216
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,448
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.

217
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,075
Yeah, well, you're talking
about a "syn-thespian."

218
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,245
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."

219
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,122
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.

220
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,707
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.

221
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,251
It can be done.
With my new computer code,

222
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,087
it can be done.

223
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,714
You and me...

224
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,508
we can do this together.

225
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,384
I don't know anything
about computers.

226
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,055
See, that's why--
that's why you're so perfect.

227
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,390
You have something...

228
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,893
- that I don't have.
- What's that?

229
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,771
An eye.

230
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,065
An eye for performance.

231
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,067
You know the truth
when you see it.

232
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,361
I know.

233
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,988
I mean, I've seen
your movies.

234
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,907
I love your movies.

235
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,036
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."

236
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,581
That changed my life.

237
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,959
You saw "Straw God"?

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,962
I have seen every frame
of your work.

239
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,881
You're the only
filmmaker

240
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,925
with the artistic
integrity...

241
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,595
to realize my vision.

242
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,225
You and me,
art and science--

243
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,311
We're the perfect
marriage.

244
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,564
Hank...

245
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,399
I've had
a rough day today.

246
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,067
But, I tell you what,

247
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,653
I'll call you
about this next week.

248
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,448
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.

249
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,492
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?

250
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,579
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.

251
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,540
I'll be dead.

252
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,336
Well, I'm already dead.

253
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,096
Call me!

254
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,599
This week!

255
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,102
Please.

256
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,872
What do you mean
she won't work with me?

257
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,707
She's done nothing.

258
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,210
She doesn't have
a single credit to her name.

259
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,545
Better no credits
than a Taransky credit.

260
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,380
Art,
you don't understand.

261
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,966
I've mortgaged everything
to finish this film.

262
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,885
The creditors
are calling me.

263
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,887
They're at the door
for God's sake.

264
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,723
Hello?

265
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,392
Damn it!

266
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,563
Mr. Taransky.

267
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,818
Mr. Taransky!

268
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,993
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!

269
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,746
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!

270
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,914
Mr. Taransky!

271
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,166
Hank Aleno!

272
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,006
I represent the estate
of Mr. Hank Aleno.

273
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,511
It was his last wish
that you have this.

274
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,517
What is it?

275
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,185
I have no idea.

276
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,770
He wanted you
to have it.

277
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,532
Valarie!

278
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,743
Valarie!

279
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,792
Valarie!

280
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,841
Valarie,
what are you running from?

281
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,009
From Valarie.

282
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,932
Valarie, no!

283
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,904
Jack, are you there?

284
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,660
Something like this
can happen and what...

285
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,580
was it for?

286
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,206
Why are we here?

287
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,752
Is that what
you're asking, Jack?

288
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,129
Why are we here?

289
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,300
No why...

290
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,303
just here.

291
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,640
Just here.

292
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,507
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

293
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,676
I know I may be guilty
of a crime,

294
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,264
but it was committed with
the purest of intentions.

295
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,351
I wanted to send a message

296
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,353
to the acting community

297
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,188
who...

298
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,482
put themselves above
the work,

299
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,068
who put themselves above me.

300
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,653
So, what did
you guys think?

301
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,863
So fake.

302
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,199
Totally artificial.

303
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,456
Like we're suppose to believe
that was 19th century Lisbon.

304
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,291
- Come on.
- Guys...

305
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,794
Who's looking at the sets
when she's on screen?

306
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,295
Oh, yeah.

307
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:10,882
There he is.

308
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,801
That's my dad,
Viktor Taransky.

309
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,599
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.

310
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,309
Breathtaking.

311
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,645
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?

312
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,688
The nun?

313
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,565
Or are you talking about
the mother?

314
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,526
A star like that, who cares about
the supporting cast?

315
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,070
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.

316
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,073
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.

317
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,744
And the rest of the film,
what did you think?

318
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,621
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?

319
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,039
Well...

320
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,752
I saw her picture...
on the computer.

321
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,044
A computer?

322
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,883
You really didn't notice
anything unusual about her?

323
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,010
Only her brilliance.
To be honest,

324
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,344
with what you had
to work with,

325
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,263
I was expecting
a train wreck.

326
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,849
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?

327
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,311
Yeah. I have a feeling Mom's
going to take you back after this.

328
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,482
Back on the lot.
That's what--

329
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,233
I know. I know.
Come on, let's go.

330
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:15,572
A dazzling new ingenue
has come from seemingly nowhere

331
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,574
to capture the hearts of movie-going
audiences around the world

332
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,534
to capture the hearts of movie-going
audiences around the world

333
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,996
in her debut film
"Sunrise, Sunset."

334
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,123
But who is Simone?

335
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,917
We know so little about her.

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,336
And why the secrecy?

337
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,214
All we know for sure
is that she was discovered

338
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,633
by little-known director,
Viktor Tarinsky.

339
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,593
Taransky.

340
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,184
Simone!

341
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,186
Simone?

342
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,897
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?

343
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,650
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?

344
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,736
Why? Because she would never come
to something like this.

345
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,404
She's intensely private.

346
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,615
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.

347
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,826
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?

348
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,452
They're love letters.

349
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,831
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.

350
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,084
Simone has the voice
of a young Jane Fonda,

351
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,877
the body
of Sophia Loren,

352
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,921
the grace of well,
Grace Kelly--

353
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,674
ha-ha--
and the face...

354
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,093
of Audrey Hepburn
combined with an angel.

355
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,763
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.

356
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,932
Oh, I don't know
if that's going to happen.

357
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,059
Why not?

358
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,353
She is somewhat
of a recluse.

359
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,480
That's how she stays
so pure.

360
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,608
She isolates herself
in her art.

361
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,610
Viktor, it's my studio.

362
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,737
Elaine, it's my actor.

363
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,532
There are other studios.

364
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,492
There's only one Simone.

365
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,911
Okay, have it your way,
Viktor.

366
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:54,880
Hello, Walter.

367
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,548
Nobody came in
or went out,

368
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,717
- just like you said.
- Very good.

369
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,719
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?

370
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,764
Is Ms. Simone
coming in today?

371
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:08,226
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.

372
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,645
She's going to leave
long after you're gone.

373
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,564
Remember,
under no circumstances

374
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,650
are you or anybody else
ever to enter this set

375
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,111
without my express
permission, understood?

376
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,613
Yes, sir.

377
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,531
Mr. Taransky?

378
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,825
What if it catches
on fire?

379
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,329
Let it burn.

380
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,459
Good morning, Simone.

381
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,589
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.

382
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:29,182
Simone, a star is...

383
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,893
digitized.

384
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,854
Do you know
what this means?

385
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,898
We have stepped
into a new dimension.

386
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,069
Our ability
to manufacture fraud

387
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:44,739
now exceeds our ability
to detect it.

388
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,326
I am the death of real.

389
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,497
...death of real.

390
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,624
...death of real.

391
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,381
Too much Meryl Streep.

392
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,556
A little less Streep.

393
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,685
And a little more...

394
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,772
Bacall.

395
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,983
Is this better,
Mr. Taransky?

396
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,985
Much.

397
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,528
While we're at it,

398
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,530
there's a little
something

399
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,949
I want to add
to your repertoire.

400
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,286
You've got the wrong
Holly Golightly.

401
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,039
Remember that thing
Audrey Hepburn does

402
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,999
in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

403
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,548
How do I look?

404
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,599
Give me Audrey.

405
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,392
How do I look?

406
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,187
Perfect.

407
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,815
Perfect, Simone.

408
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,316
Perfect.

409
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,861
Oh, God.

410
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,490
I'm so relaxed
around you.

411
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,954
I'm so myself.

412
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,836
You did create me.

413
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,840
I just brought someone
else's dream to life.

414
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,385
Mr. Taransky,

415
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:32,222
we both know I was nothing
without you.

416
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:34,516
I was computer code.

417
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,185
I was ones and zeros.

418
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,062
I was nothing.

419
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,358
Well...

420
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:45,360
that's true.

421
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:48,196
I don't want
to boast, but...

422
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,867
Are you ever going to tell
the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?

423
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,120
I'm going tell
the truth about you.

424
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,330
Why wouldn't i?

425
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,791
Of course...

426
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,461
with Hank's tragic passing,

427
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,797
his secret did die
with him.

428
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,845
This is
a classic case of

429
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,849
technology in search
of an artist.

430
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,519
Someone with integrity,

431
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,980
someone with vision,
someone who can see.

432
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,693
See beyond
this irrational

433
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,320
allegiance
to flesh and blood.

434
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,946
Someone who can see

435
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,991
that with the rise
in the price of a real actor

436
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,827
and the fall in the price
of a fake,

437
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,830
that the scales have tipped--

438
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,999
naturally in favor
of the fake.

439
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,838
Someone who can see

440
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,132
that if a performance
is genuine,

441
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,511
it doesn't matter
if the actor's real or not.

442
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,307
And what's real anymore?

443
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,309
Most actors these days

444
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,311
have digital work done
to them.

445
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,356
It's a gray area.

446
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,318
The only real truth
is the work.

447
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,531
I'm going to tell
the truth about you

448
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,991
after your next picture.

449
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,666
You're so beautiful.

450
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:31,508
You're too beautiful.

451
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,347
We're going to fix that.

452
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,203
Is this on?

453
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:05,876
I will not be taking any questions
regarding Simone.

454
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,919
I do, however,
have a statement

455
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,838
to read on her behalf.

456
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,969
"To Whom it May Concern:

457
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,597
I'm deeply grateful
for the extraordinary

458
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,600
public response
to Mr. Taransky's film.

459
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,978
At this time I will be
conducting no interviews,

460
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,564
or making
publicity appearances--

461
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:31,443
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press

462
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:35,822
respect my privacy and let
the work speak for itself.

463
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,699
Yours truly, Simone."

464
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,285
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?!

465
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,162
Where did you find her?

466
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,290
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?

467
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,167
No questions
regarding Simone.

468
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,377
We're just trying
to get some answers.

469
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,421
I will make
my final statement.

470
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:55,967
Ms. Simone begins production
on her new film today--

471
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,053
"Eternity Forever."

472
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:01,139
This is a project
which has been near and dear

473
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,309
to my heart since I wrote it

474
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,103
nine years ago.

475
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,190
Thank you.

476
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,692
Would you answer
a question regarding Hank?

477
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,118
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?

478
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:24,913
Funny, why is the movie
dedicated to Hank?

479
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,581
Are they involved?

480
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:33,630
They were at one time
inseparable. Yes.

481
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,467
And now?

482
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,511
Now...

483
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:42,431
sadly to say,
only in spirit.

484
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,600
Thank you.

485
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,084
Your car will be ready
in just a minute.

486
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:13,086
We gave you
a complimentary car wash.

487
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,255
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.

488
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:17,090
Thank you.

489
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:21,428
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.

490
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,430
I am so happy for us.

491
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:25,140
The film, the chemistry.

492
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:26,767
Nothing against
Nicola Anders,

493
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,935
but I think
that Simone and I,

494
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,979
we really worked
great together.

495
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:34,191
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.

496
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,776
You can't--

497
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,819
Look, I have not read
"Eternity Forever,"

498
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,446
but it is fantastic.

499
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,948
And I know I would be perfect
for the part of Clive.

500
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,492
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.

501
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,619
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.

502
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,746
Come on, man.

503
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:50,123
Look, I ran into Simone
on the lot.

504
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,958
- Really?
- Yes, really.

505
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,127
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.

506
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,712
People coming at her
from all angles.

507
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,631
Maybe she didn't want
you to know, huh?

508
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,967
I strongly sensed

509
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,054
that she thought I would be
perfect for Clyde as well.

510
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,597
- Really?
- Strongly.

511
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,099
Excuse me.

512
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,475
Sure.

513
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,477
Hello?

514
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,979
Simone, it's so great
to hear from you.

515
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,481
How are you,
sweetheart?

516
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:17,150
You'll never guess
who I'm with.

517
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:20,821
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.

518
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,489
No, you're not
even close.

519
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,741
Hal.

520
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,327
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?

521
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,330
I'm getting nothing from her side
of the conversation.

522
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:32,290
No, I don't think
he put on weight.

523
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:35,919
Anyway, listen. Do you think he'd
be right for "Eternity Forever"?

524
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,921
He's not the right type?

525
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,173
You want to go
in another direction?

526
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:42,926
Well... we'll try and talk her
into it, don't worry.

527
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,594
Anything you can do.

528
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,222
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.

529
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,224
What is this,
some kind of jamming device?

530
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,059
This is a bad place to talk.

531
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,687
Maybe he's just
talking to himself.

532
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,897
Taransky's not
that good an actor.

533
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,108
Honey, I know you want
to do charity work.

534
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,236
No, they've taken
special precautions.

535
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,530
Some kind
of new encryption.

536
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,615
Why would they do that?

537
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,121
Well, whatever it is...

538
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,206
it's dark.

539
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,209
Dark?

540
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,837
Yeah. Very.

541
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,422
All right,
we'll talk about it

542
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,841
at the beach house
this weekend.

543
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,435
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?

544
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:35,020
You'll lose yourself
in that thing.

545
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,773
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?

546
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,150
Dad, I know
plenty of boys.

547
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:41,818
You do? Who?

548
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,153
Where do you meet them?

549
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:44,905
You meet them
in those chat rooms?

550
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,824
How do you know you're not talking
to some middle-aged freak?

551
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,494
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged
freak a mile away.

552
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:53,163
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.

553
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,791
And Lainey,
leave the computer, please.

554
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,417
Okay.

555
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,718
Dad, it might be better
to eat inside.

556
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,470
Stay here.

557
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,142
What is this?

558
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,397
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?

559
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:22,651
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!

560
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:26,363
Simone appears only
when I want her to appear!

561
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,697
Sounds like a prisoner.

562
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:30,158
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.

563
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,244
I mean, you look kind
of captive to me.

564
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,837
Lainey,
don't you ever wonder

565
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:43,755
where I'm really
hiding Simone?

566
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:46,508
Just as long as I know
where you are, Dad.

567
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,346
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.

568
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:53,265
Hello, Viktor.

569
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,559
Sorry I got her back late.

570
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,602
Oh, no problem.

571
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,396
Hey, you want
to come in?

572
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,613
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.

573
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:10,866
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.

574
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,287
Viktor, we simply
have to discuss

575
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,289
"Eternity Forever."

576
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,292
I still haven't received
Simone's script notes.

577
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,627
There aren't any.

578
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,504
If the filmmakers
are happy,

579
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,465
she's happy.

580
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:30,385
She considers herself,
you know, an instrument.

581
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,763
So she's really going
to do all this nudity?

582
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,681
It's on the page.

583
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,600
We have to do something
about this budget.

584
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,059
It's completely
unrealistic.

585
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,437
You allowed nothing
for limousine service.

586
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,023
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.

587
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,901
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.

588
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,987
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?

589
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,988
Where?

590
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,698
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.

591
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,617
Okay, great. Thanks.

592
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,078
At least, Viktor,
contingency for wardrobe.

593
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,996
Anybody can go up a size.

594
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,873
I guarantee she will not
gain an ounce.

595
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:01,666
She is so disciplined.

596
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,960
Well, we've gotta do
something about this--

597
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,379
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?

598
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,216
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.

599
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,968
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?

600
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,096
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.

601
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,972
Shoot it
on the last day.

602
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,141
Listen, Viktor.

603
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:21,228
I want to talk to you now,
not as Elaine, Studio Head,

604
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:25,607
but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.

605
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:30,278
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.

606
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,906
But you need
to be careful.

607
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,575
We both know you wouldn't be
making this overblown art film

608
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,370
if you hadn't convinced
Simone to be in it.

609
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:40,956
Elaine...

610
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,626
talking to you now,
not as Viktor, Director,

611
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:48,088
but as Viktor,
your first former husband,

612
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,550
what happened to you? Huh?

613
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,220
Experience, Viktor.

614
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,222
That's what happened
to me.

615
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,057
Yeah, I've seen this
a hundred times.

616
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,810
- Really?
- Yeah.

617
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,479
These young stars
destroying

618
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,440
the very people
who discovered them.

619
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,692
I'm worried about you,
that's all.

620
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,361
This woman,
she controls your destiny.

621
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:12,821
She doesn't control
my destiny.

622
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,073
There's something
about her I don't trust.

623
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,082
Hi, Jane.

624
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,126
Thanks for taking me back,
Mr. Taransky.

625
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:28,754
I know that it looked like
I sided with the studio,

626
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,756
but I've always believed
in you. Honestly.

627
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,424
Don't worry.
I understand.

628
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,426
- Are they--
- They're all here.

629
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:36,595
Okay, thank you.
Hello.

630
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,764
Viktor.

631
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,766
I just want to say
I am delighted

632
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:44,352
to have such
a wonderful cast

633
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,105
assembled here
for "Eternity Forever."

634
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,732
A reminder:

635
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,443
as a condition for working
on this picture,

636
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,945
you will not be rehearsing
with Simone.

637
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,490
You will not be shooting
with Simone.

638
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,868
Actually, you are forbidden
from contacting Simone

639
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,370
at any time, for any reason,
whatsoever.

640
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,790
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?

641
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,084
- Body double.
- For her?

642
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,127
For you.

643
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,714
Anyway, Simone insisted
on speaking with you herself

644
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:14,216
before filming started.

645
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,760
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?

646
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,887
I certainly am,
Mr. Taransky.

647
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,100
So are we, Simone.

648
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,603
Why don't you leave me alone
with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky,

649
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,730
so we can get to know
each other better?

650
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,607
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.

651
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,275
Hi, who's there?

652
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,903
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.

653
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:42,577
I'm Mac.

654
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,704
I turned down
a Bertolucci film to be here.

655
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,583
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.

656
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,585
Hi, I'm Claris.

657
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,879
You used to date
my cousin, Dell.

658
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,548
I'm Hewlitt.

659
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,716
We can rehearse in private
if you like.

660
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,011
My name is Lotus.

661
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,180
God, I can't believe
I'm talking to you.

662
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:04,683
We are going to become
such great friends.

663
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,560
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.

664
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,062
It's great to be working
together... again.

665
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,856
Is that everyone?

666
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:14,526
Well, obviously,
as you know, I'm Simone.

667
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,195
Who else?

668
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,281
I just want to start

669
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,908
by apologizing
for my process.

670
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,035
I know it's an unusual way
to work,

671
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,538
but I just find
I relate better to people

672
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,248
when they're not
actually there.

673
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,250
Oh, of course.
Of course.

674
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,210
I don't have much to say,

675
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:35,672
Except, that I know
it's gonna be a great project

676
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:40,594
if we all just trust
Mr. Taransky's vision.

677
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:43,889
Always do
what Mr. Taransky says.

678
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,934
If in doubt,
do it the Taransky way.

679
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,937
I know we're gonna make
a wonderful movie together.

680
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,482
Together.

681
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:55,275
Absolutely.

682
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,342
Veronica.

683
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:26,723
What you don't understand,
Clyde, is that love--

684
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,100
Still too big.

685
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:30,060
I like it,
but it's too big.

686
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,355
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.

687
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:44,157
What you don't understand,
Clyde,

688
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:48,036
is that love
is like a wildflower.

689
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:51,248
But that flower only grows

690
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,166
on the edge...

691
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,795
of a very high cliff.

692
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,464
Perfect.

693
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:00,465
Perfect.

694
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,845
Simone. Simone.

695
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,514
Simone.

696
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:13,019
Gonna be a little change
in plans, Simone.

697
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:18,358
You have no idea
the effect

698
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,444
your performance
is having on people.

699
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,654
We can't stop now.

700
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:25,407
These films,
they're speaking

701
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,367
to the human condition.

702
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,121
We're changing lives.

703
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,918
People need to believe
you're real.

704
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,464
To reveal the truth now,

705
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,466
it would be too cruel.

706
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:48,388
You're gonna get in
a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.

707
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,557
Now, why do you have
to bring that up?!

708
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,728
I mean,
everything's a risk.

709
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,105
But it's worth it,
isn't it?

710
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:04,071
We've done
enough work today.

711
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:08,575
You've been cooped up
in there too long.

712
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:11,078
So how about...

713
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:13,747
you and I going
out on the town?

714
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,251
Tonight, they're going
to see you

715
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,212
with their own eyes.

716
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:32,390
Excuse me.

717
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:35,894
I will be checking in
a very special guest.

718
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:39,439
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.

719
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,277
Now, Ms. Enomis
demands her privacy.

720
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,614
So, you will switch off
all surveillance cameras.

721
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:50,784
I alone, will escort
Ms. Enomis to her room

722
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,744
via the rear exit.

723
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,871
She must not be disturbed
at any time,

724
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,581
for any reason whatsoever.

725
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:59,209
I'm sure I can rely
on your discretion.

726
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:01,962
Understood, sir.

727
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,549
Thank you.

728
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,076
There she is!

729
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,715
Who is it?

730
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,759
It's Simone.

731
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:44,481
Okay, I think
everybody's here.

732
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,274
Now!

733
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:58,870
I think we're
all right now.

734
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,000
Oh, thank God
for you, Faith.

735
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,919
Thank God for you.

736
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:09,714
This is way above
and beyond

737
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,967
the call of duty
for a stand-in.

738
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,636
I must tell you,
you have no idea

739
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:17,013
the service you've
performed for Simone,

740
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,349
shielding her
from these animals.

741
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:21,518
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.

742
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:22,853
- For me?
- Yeah.

743
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:24,354
How many directors
would go

744
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,356
to so much trouble
to protect an actress?

745
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,941
It's incredible.

746
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,571
You know,
we're gonna have

747
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,114
to go back
to my place,

748
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:37,200
just to, you know,
keep them off the scent.

749
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:40,036
Of course.

750
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,626
You look so...

751
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:50,422
So much like...
um, like her?

752
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:54,050
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.

753
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,344
But you're
so very beautiful

754
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,305
in your own right.

755
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:08,356
I do find myself strangely
attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.

756
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,861
Call me Viktor.

757
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,489
Viktor.

758
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,532
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.

759
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:24,164
- Viktor.
- Yes?

760
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:26,291
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.

761
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,586
Do what you do
to Simone?

762
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:31,755
What?
What did you say?

763
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,132
I said do whatever
you do to Simone.

764
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:37,761
What I do to Simone?

765
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:39,638
Call me Simone!

766
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,264
Simone?

767
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,433
Yes. Say it again,
please.

768
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:46,103
I want to know what it's like
to be her just for one night.

769
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:47,979
Please, call me Simone.

770
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:51,691
You're with me so you can
be close to her?

771
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:53,360
Is that a problem?

772
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:57,656
Okay. Excuse me
just a minute.

773
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:59,491
Is something wrong?

774
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,743
Well, actually,

775
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:04,329
maybe we can do this
some other time

776
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:06,456
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?

777
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:11,002
Gentlemen,
the Presidential Suite.

778
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,438
Ahem--

779
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,777
I think that should
take care of everything.

780
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,362
Yes, sir.

781
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:39,781
I believe it will.

782
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:42,033
Leave me for a moment.

783
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:01,136
Simone.

784
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,131
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!

785
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:21,675
- There she is.
- The picture--

786
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:23,468
The picture.
It's a revelation.

787
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:25,303
Thank you.
Thank you.

788
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:27,097
We all worked
so hard.

789
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,475
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.

790
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,060
It was incredible.

791
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:33,603
Thank you all.

792
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:50,370
Thank you.

793
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:52,622
- Whoa!
- Viktor!

794
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:54,458
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?

795
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,462
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?

796
00:47:58,503 --> 00:47:59,921
Somebody
said she was here.

797
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,965
Jesus.
That's her glass.

798
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,470
Jack Daniels,
straight up.

799
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:09,598
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?

800
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,475
I don't know.
She's, uh...

801
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:13,310
Is that her
by the fountain?

802
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:16,438
You know,
between you and me,

803
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:18,565
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!

804
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:21,109
- Simone!
- Simone's here?

805
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,612
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?!

806
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:25,614
- Simone!
- I got your glass!

807
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:27,783
I'm your biggest fan!

808
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,706
Simone!

809
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,666
- Simone!
- Simone?

810
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,511
Get out!

811
00:48:50,555 --> 00:48:52,224
Not you two.

812
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:04,945
She goes to a major
Hollywood A-list party

813
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,655
and we don't get
an interview,

814
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:09,783
a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?!

815
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:11,827
Is that what
you're telling me?

816
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,495
Nobody got a photograph.

817
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:15,247
Nobody ever gets a photograph.

818
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,332
We have our best people
on it, Mr. Sayer.

819
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:18,542
Get better people!

820
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,129
What about the 24-hour
tail on Taransky?

821
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,507
They're camped out every place
he goes; every concierge,

822
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,384
every maitre d',
they're all on the take.

823
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:29,386
But this Simone woman
is good.

824
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:31,805
Obviously, that is not
her real name.

825
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:33,598
She uses
an assumed identity.

826
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,267
She travels under
a false name.

827
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,269
She checks into
a hotel under an alias.

828
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:40,272
Never stays in the same place
two nights in a row.

829
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:42,816
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?

830
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:50,323
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?!

831
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,618
What about
the fingerprints?

832
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:56,329
What happened when we dusted
that whole hotel suite?

833
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,790
Well, we have some
of Taransky's fingerprints,

834
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,419
a lot of yours...

835
00:50:02,502 --> 00:50:04,296
and none of hers.

836
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:08,008
No one is that perfect,
that pure.

837
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:10,469
You know, I had something
on Mother Teresa once.

838
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,137
But then she died

839
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,972
and it just wasn't
worth it anymore.

840
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:17,893
I know how to flush out
this Simone woman.

841
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:22,439
A tell-all story
from her childhood.

842
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,399
You have one?

843
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:29,362
I will when you're
finished writing it.

844
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,302
Please don't
make me do this.

845
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:54,471
Guard, open this door
right now.

846
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:56,348
Mr. Taransky gave me
specific instructions

847
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:57,724
never to open up this door.

848
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,267
- What are you doing?!
- Mr. Taransky!

849
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,478
- Why did you do this?!
- We have to talk to her!

850
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,355
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.

851
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,440
What is this about?

852
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:07,192
We've got the tracking numbers
for "Eternity Forever."

853
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:08,193
They're in the toilet.

854
00:51:08,276 --> 00:51:10,112
She's gotta get out there
and sell the film.

855
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:12,280
What do you want her to do,
go door-to-door?

856
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:15,283
Even Garbo would be on the talk show
circuit if she were alive!

857
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,994
It is precisely because she
doesn't crave the limelight

858
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:19,329
that people love her!

859
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,206
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,

860
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:24,042
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.

861
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:25,836
If you can't handle her,
I will.

862
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:28,130
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.

863
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,132
Today, her mother dies.

864
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:31,967
Scene 42
of "Good for Nothing."

865
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,803
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.

866
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:36,805
- Step aside!
- We're going in!

867
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:40,183
- This is ridiculous!
- No! No!

868
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,519
- What are you doing?!
- Simone!

869
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,190
I trusted you.

870
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,112
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!

871
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:54,448
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,

872
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,616
- girl-to-girl. Just us.
- Where is she?

873
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,452
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?

874
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:01,621
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?

875
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:04,207
Viktor, we're not paying
for this are we?

876
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:05,667
What is all this?

877
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,088
What is all this?

878
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:12,090
Well...

879
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,468
I suppose

880
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,970
it was gonna come out
sooner or later.

881
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:20,474
I guess I'm actually
relieved in a way.

882
00:52:20,515 --> 00:52:22,434
I can just say it finally.

883
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:26,521
She's a computer--

884
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,607
addict.

885
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,192
What?

886
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:32,569
She's a computer addict!

887
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:34,946
She's buried in here.

888
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,907
Day in, day out.

889
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:41,036
Of course.
I should have guessed.

890
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,331
It's why she never
goes anywhere,

891
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:47,000
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.

892
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:49,252
Probably spends
her whole life in chat rooms.

893
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:51,588
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.

894
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,590
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.

895
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,511
She's extremely
agoraphobic.

896
00:52:57,552 --> 00:53:00,597
She has a morbid fear
of people,

897
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:03,350
of germs,

898
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,894
places, heights--

899
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:07,646
- Name it.
- This is terrible.

900
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,439
How is she going
to plug the film?

901
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:12,109
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.

902
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,611
Maybe I could get her
to do something.

903
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:16,905
Maybe a television
talk show or something.

904
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:17,989
Yes!

905
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,700
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.

906
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,119
- Live?
- Please.

907
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:24,371
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.

908
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:26,164
We can work with that.

909
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,125
I can't promise anything.

910
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,876
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.

911
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,212
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.

912
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:34,047
Thank you.

913
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:35,382
Give her our best.

914
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:37,300
That agoraphobia--
it's like a plague.

915
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:38,885
It's out of control
in Europe.

916
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:43,974
It's so good of you
to protect her like this.

917
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:47,144
She wanted you--

918
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:49,479
No, no.
Don't touch that.

919
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,732
Germs.

920
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,483
She wanted you
to have that.

921
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:56,236
She was there.
She was right there.

922
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,946
Yeah.

923
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,908
Oh, my gosh.

924
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,413
She didn't,
by any chance,

925
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:08,165
happen
to mention me?

926
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:11,251
Actually, she did.

927
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:13,837
She, uh...

928
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:17,883
she said that she thought
you were very beautiful.

929
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:20,260
- Really?
- Yeah.

930
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:23,138
Would you want to go

931
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,640
and get something to eat,
or something?

932
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,603
Viktor,
I'd love to, really.,

933
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:32,606
but don't you have
to go talk to Simone?

934
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:36,693
If I can find her.

935
00:54:41,364 --> 00:54:43,450
Well.

936
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:45,786
All right. Good.

937
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,954
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.

938
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,918
I'm gonna-- Bye.

939
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:16,608
Tonight,
on Frank Brand Live--

940
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:18,902
Since taking the nation
by storm

941
00:55:18,985 --> 00:55:23,031
in her debut movie,
"Sunrise, Sunset,"

942
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:27,285
no one has managed to land
a live television interview

943
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:31,123
with this fabulous
shooting starlet, Simone--

944
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:33,125
until now.

945
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:36,420
she's agreed to talk
with us tonight

946
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,296
from the set
of her new film.

947
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,507
Welcome, Simone.

948
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:46,721
So glad you can find time
in your hectic schedule to be here.

949
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:48,849
It's my pleasure.

950
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:50,851
Wonderful to be
with you, Frank.

951
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:56,189
No one can accuse you
of being overexposed, Simone.

952
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:59,234
Why have you stayed so completely
out of the limelight?

953
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:01,570
I guess I just think actors
talk too much.

954
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:04,573
Does the world really want
to hear my life story

955
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:07,117
just because I have a movie
opening on Friday?

956
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,536
Wow.

957
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:11,872
She is all woman.

958
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:13,165
Of course, the problem

959
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,584
with shying away
from publicity these days

960
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,003
is that it tends
to attract even more.

961
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:20,422
Don't I know it.

962
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,382
But the only reason
I'm here now,

963
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:25,177
is to put the attention
back where it belongs,

964
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,554
on Mr. Taransky's film.

965
00:56:27,637 --> 00:56:30,015
And you don't secretly want
the attention?

966
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,933
I'm not even sure
I deserve it.

967
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:33,894
You see, after tonight,

968
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:36,271
I'll have just as much
screen time on your show

969
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:38,065
as I have in my movies.

970
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:40,817
Now, how is that healthy
for a performer?

971
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:44,154
Because you have to understand,
Frank, none of this is real.

972
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:47,199
Who I am on screen
and who I really am,

973
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,534
they're two totally
different people.

974
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:51,495
Change of topic.

975
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:53,497
You have been
romantically linked

976
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,874
to dozens of men
in the press--

977
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:59,211
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking,
Fidel Castro,

978
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:01,379
most recently,
Viktor Taransky.

979
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:03,423
Is there a Mr. Right
in there somewhere?

980
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:07,552
You know, Frank, I'd rather not
discuss my private life.

981
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:09,221
But Viktor and I,

982
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:11,223
we are inseparable.

983
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:13,058
Oh, Viktor.

984
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:14,893
You dog.

985
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:18,146
I wouldn't be here today
without him.

986
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,034
Would you like
a moment, Simone?

987
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,161
No, I'm okay.

988
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,458
Okay.

989
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,502
Then let's talk about
this work

990
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,045
you care so much about.

991
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:43,505
Sure.

992
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:45,590
Where would you like
to start, Frank?

993
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:48,218
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.

994
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:50,512
Nudity's just never been
an issue for me.

995
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,514
I know that tree.

996
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:55,267
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.

997
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:56,560
I know where that is.

998
00:57:56,601 --> 00:57:58,603
What exactly was it
that attracted you

999
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,188
to your first two projects?

1000
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:03,191
I suppose what I like most
about the movies I'm in

1001
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,777
is that they're not about
special effects.

1002
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:08,864
And they are better
for it, I might add.

1003
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:22,043
We appear to be having
some satellite difficulties.

1004
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:25,213
But, before we lose you
completely, Simone,

1005
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:27,716
I just want to say
thank you.

1006
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,301
Thank you, Frank.

1007
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:31,845
Goodbye.

1008
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:35,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simone.

1009
00:59:06,254 --> 00:59:07,839
I've been here before.

1010
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:09,841
On my honeymoon
with my ex-wife.

1011
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:12,511
Yeah, look.

1012
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:14,971
It's the exact
same tree.

1013
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:17,015
And look
in the distance.

1014
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:20,769
The mountain.

1015
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:25,857
It's a hotel.

1016
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:30,362
I don't understand.

1017
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,031
Could they have built
that hotel since yesterday?

1018
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:36,868
Get in the car.

1019
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:58,265
Simone! Simone!

1020
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,692
We don't do the photos,
you don't get the cover.

1021
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:10,152
It's as simple as that.

1022
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:13,071
Yes. Written answers
to written questions.

1023
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:15,490
Didn't we have
this conversation before?

1024
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:19,536
Yeah, web site interviews,
no problem.

1025
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,289
I think people are gonna
love "Eternity Forever."

1026
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:25,625
"Eternity Forever"
is my finest work.

1027
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,419
I loved working
with the director

1028
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:29,713
of "Eternity Forever."
He's a genius.

1029
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:31,047
You wish.

1030
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:36,970
It's wonderful being
a movie star.

1031
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:42,184
But there's so many other ways
I want to express myself.

1032
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,942
But it's not enough
to be a movie star.

1033
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,903
You have to be
a pop star, too.

1034
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:56,990
If you really want
to make a difference.

1035
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:24,893
Nice boat, Taransky!

1036
01:01:24,976 --> 01:01:26,728
It's not a boat,

1037
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:28,480
it's a yacht.

1038
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:31,983
I know
what you're up to.

1039
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:34,528
You know, I really
don't have time for this.

1040
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:37,406
I think you do,
'cause I know it's a fake.

1041
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,367
It's bogus.

1042
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,203
You used an old library shot
for the background.

1043
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,581
She never
was in New Mexico.

1044
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:48,625
She never even left
the studio.

1045
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,627
I've done my homework.

1046
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,171
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.

1047
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:56,550
I've looked at every piece
of publicity she's done.

1048
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,301
And as far as I can tell,

1049
01:01:58,385 --> 01:01:59,970
there's no evidence

1050
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:02,222
that she has ever left
the studio.

1051
01:02:02,305 --> 01:02:03,932
Oh...

1052
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:06,309
And for some reason,

1053
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,228
this woman leaves
no paper trail?

1054
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,064
Now, I've obtained a copy
of your bank account.

1055
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:13,358
I know you have
power of attorney,

1056
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:15,694
but so far,
you have not turned over

1057
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:18,196
a single solitary cent
to this woman.

1058
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,906
I keep it in a trust.

1059
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:22,200
I know that's what you want
people to believe,

1060
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:23,744
but I gotta tell you,

1061
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:26,037
embezzlement
is a serious matter.

1062
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:28,498
Not to mention abduction.

1063
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,333
- Abduction?
- Yeah.

1064
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,210
Off the record.

1065
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:34,045
I want to know
how you're doing it.

1066
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:36,465
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?

1067
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:38,800
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?

1068
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:43,180
What do you do? Do you keep her
locked in a box somewhere?

1069
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:45,849
What is it exactly

1070
01:02:45,932 --> 01:02:47,809
that you want?

1071
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:50,437
I want to see her.

1072
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,066
Unless you show me
Simone live and in person,

1073
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:56,902
I show these photos
to the authorities.

1074
01:02:59,654 --> 01:03:01,823
You want to see her?

1075
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:03,492
All right.

1076
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,160
You've got a deal.

1077
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:09,247
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!

1078
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,375
Good!

1079
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:20,342
Mr. Taransky.

1080
01:03:20,383 --> 01:03:23,386
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.

1081
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,638
This time tomorrow night,

1082
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:27,599
she'll be standing right here
in front of 100,000 people.

1083
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:30,352
We could've sold
this out 20 times.

1084
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:32,270
Yeah, the sound check
went great.

1085
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:34,231
The laser show
is good to go.

1086
01:03:34,272 --> 01:03:35,690
I gotta ask you,
though,

1087
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:38,360
you ordered
an awful lot of smoke.

1088
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:40,654
Well, that's the way
she wants it.

1089
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,864
After you told us
about the death threats,

1090
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,200
security guards
are under strict instructions

1091
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:46,868
never to take their eyes
off the crowd.

1092
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:49,871
Excellent. Here, Simone wanted
you to have these.

1093
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:51,456
- Unreal.
- And remember--

1094
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,417
no cameras,
no binoculars.

1095
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:58,088
Ladies and gentlemen,
Viktor Taransky Promotions

1096
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:02,134
is proud to present Simone--
live on stage

1097
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:05,595
for the debut concert
of the Splendid Isolation tour.

1098
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,684
Let's get you into hair
and make-up.

1099
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,667
No.

1100
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:46,178
No.

1101
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:57,355
Yes.

1102
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,149
You know, it's easier

1103
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:01,985
to make 100,000 believe
than just one?

1104
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,619
And now, the one,

1105
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,789
the only, Simone!

1106
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,376
I love you...

1107
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,340
LA.

1108
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:25,675
It's great to be here.

1109
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,848
# Looking out #

1110
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,810
# On the morning rain #

1111
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:39,815
# I used
to feel so inspired #

1112
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:46,363
# And when I knew I had
to face another day #

1113
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:52,035
# Lord, it made me feel
so tired #

1114
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:58,166
# Before the day I met you #

1115
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,710
# Life was so unkind #

1116
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:05,340
# But you're the key
to my peace of mind #

1117
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:08,427
# 'Cause you make me feel #

1118
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:11,805
# You make me feel #

1119
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:18,145
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

1120
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:23,150
# Oh, baby #

1121
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,985
# What you've done to me #

1122
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,070
# Done to me #

1123
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:31,158
# You make me feel
so good inside #

1124
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:34,202
# Good inside #

1125
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:37,831
# And I just wanna be #

1126
01:06:37,914 --> 01:06:40,125
# Wanna be #

1127
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:44,045
# Close to you,
you make me feel so alive #

1128
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:47,507
# 'Cause you make me feel #

1129
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:50,886
# You make me feel #

1130
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:57,225
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

1131
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,269
# You make me feel #

1132
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:02,481
- # You make me feel #
- # You make me feel #

1133
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:05,400
# You make me feel #

1134
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:10,489
# You make me feel
like a real... #

1135
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,951
# You make me feel #

1136
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:18,288
# Feel like a... #

1137
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:23,752
# You make me feel
like a real... #

1138
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:29,925
Thank you.

1139
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:32,636
Never stop believing.

1140
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:39,768
Yeah! Simone!

1141
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:44,564
# What you've done to me #

1142
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:47,818
# Natural woman. #

1143
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:56,243
I said I didn't want
to be disturbed!

1144
01:07:58,036 --> 01:08:00,122
Viktor.

1145
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:04,835
My two favorite girls
in all the world.

1146
01:08:04,876 --> 01:08:06,378
We just stopped by
to congratulate Simone.

1147
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,921
Well, you know...

1148
01:08:08,004 --> 01:08:10,132
she's lying down.
She's exhausted.

1149
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,092
Yeah, I can imagine.

1150
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:15,345
Listen, thank Simone
for the tickets, okay?

1151
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:17,556
That's a good color
on you.

1152
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:20,600
It was
a great show, Dad.

1153
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,649
I can't believe
she's doing this.

1154
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:29,401
Taking advantage
of him this way.

1155
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:30,944
- It's cruel.
- Why?

1156
01:08:31,027 --> 01:08:33,488
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.

1157
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:36,241
Viktor won't be able to take that,
he's too sensitive.

1158
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,243
This'll destroy him.

1159
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:39,995
Elaine, do you realize

1160
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:42,122
that you can't stop
talking about Viktor?

1161
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:43,665
I have to talk to her.

1162
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:49,671
I've been meaning
to talk to you.

1163
01:08:51,047 --> 01:08:54,426
I'm starting to feel
like I don't exist.

1164
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:07,939
Dad?

1165
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:10,942
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.

1166
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:21,286
So how's your love life?

1167
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:23,288
I do okay.

1168
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,290
What about you?

1169
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,626
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.

1170
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:29,461
I noticed.

1171
01:09:34,216 --> 01:09:36,760
You know I don't like
to get between you and mom,

1172
01:09:36,843 --> 01:09:40,138
but she's feeling
down right now.

1173
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:41,848
She broke up with Kent.

1174
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:50,440
She thinks
you're with Simone.

1175
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:52,818
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.

1176
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:54,569
I don't have
a relationship with Simone.

1177
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:57,614
I know, I know,
but Mom doesn't.

1178
01:09:57,697 --> 01:09:59,658
Maybe if Simone spoke
to her she could

1179
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:02,828
straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.

1180
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:05,330
Dinner?

1181
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,165
I don't know
about dinner.

1182
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,502
That'd be difficult,
I think.

1183
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:14,673
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.

1184
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:16,508
They have to meet
face-to-face.

1185
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,847
Well, I'll think
of something.

1186
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:25,225
The escalating violence,

1187
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:28,019
tragic loss of human life,
and threat of all-out war

1188
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,439
was overshadowed today
by the announcement

1189
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,315
of the Oscar nominations.

1190
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:36,319
- Hello?
- Hello?

1191
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:39,239
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?

1192
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:42,284
- Oh my God. Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.

1193
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:44,995
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--

1194
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:47,706
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.

1195
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:49,833
Beside you.

1196
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:54,629
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.

1197
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:57,299
- Hi!
- Hi.

1198
01:10:57,382 --> 01:11:00,719
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,

1199
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,138
But I'm on my way
to see Viktor right now.

1200
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:06,516
Simone, I know what's
going on between you two.

1201
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,852
Oh? No. Oh, Elaine,

1202
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:10,228
there's absolutely nothing.

1203
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:12,397
It's strictly
a working relationship.

1204
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,483
I just don't want
to see Viktor get hurt.

1205
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:17,235
Sounds to me like you still
have feelings for him.

1206
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:20,197
Well, we have
a daughter together.

1207
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:23,408
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.

1208
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:27,412
I'm in love with the camera.

1209
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:31,083
Simone, I recognize
the coat you're wearing.

1210
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,335
I gave it to Viktor
on his birthday.

1211
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:34,753
Christ.

1212
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:36,671
Elaine, I just--

1213
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:38,215
Whoa.

1214
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:43,845
God! Oh my God!
I tell ya.

1215
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:50,560
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful. I know that.

1216
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:53,105
But, Viktor,
he's just so crazy about you.

1217
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,148
Could you go
to the Oscars with him?

1218
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:56,858
No, no, no.

1219
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:58,777
If you won't do it
for him,

1220
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,654
I ask you, please,
do it for me.

1221
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:06,243
Okay. Okay.
For you.

1222
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,161
For you I'll go.

1223
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:10,831
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.

1224
01:12:10,872 --> 01:12:12,666
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.

1225
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:13,792
- Oh, yes. Bye.
- Bye!

1226
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,335
Goodbye.

1227
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:20,298
Oh!

1228
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:27,764
And, the winner
of Best Actress...

1229
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:29,433
is...

1230
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:32,811
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.

1231
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:37,858
The winners are Simone
for "Sunrise, Sunset"...

1232
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:40,360
Thank you.

1233
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:46,533
...and Simone
for "Eternity Forever."

1234
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:53,874
Unfortunately, Simone cannot
be with us here tonight

1235
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:56,209
but thanks to the miracle
of modern technology,

1236
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:59,463
she joins us live from her
Goodwill Tour of the third world.

1237
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:01,465
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simone!

1238
01:13:06,052 --> 01:13:07,804
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

1239
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:10,265
This means
so much to me.

1240
01:13:10,307 --> 01:13:13,143
I'm just sorry I couldn't
be there with you.

1241
01:13:13,226 --> 01:13:15,979
First, I want to acknowledge
my fellow nominees.

1242
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:19,024
I don't even feel I belong
in the Best Actress category,

1243
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:21,568
Iet alone with these
wonderful human beings.

1244
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,780
And I also wanna thank
my co-stars

1245
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:28,116
and the studio, of course.

1246
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,202
And as always,
I dedicate this to Hank,

1247
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:33,371
without whom none of this
would be possible.

1248
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:37,834
I love you, Hank,
wherever you are.

1249
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:42,547
Thank you.

1250
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:49,679
Who's Hank?
Her agent?

1251
01:13:51,556 --> 01:13:54,101
- Her father.
- Oh.

1252
01:13:55,268 --> 01:13:56,728
Why didn't
she thank you?

1253
01:13:58,522 --> 01:14:00,273
She did.

1254
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:04,820
Didn't she?

1255
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,446
No.

1256
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:15,455
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,

1257
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:17,290
Viktor Taransky,

1258
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,793
without whom none
of this would be possible.

1259
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:23,964
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,

1260
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,632
Viktor Taransky,

1261
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:27,968
without whom none
of this would be possible.

1262
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:29,636
Why didn't I say it?

1263
01:14:31,722 --> 01:14:33,473
How could I forget
to say it?

1264
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:37,227
I wrote it.

1265
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:40,647
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,

1266
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:42,232
Viktor Taransky,

1267
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:45,402
without whom none
of this would be possible.

1268
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,699
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,

1269
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,909
Are you ready
for your casting session?

1270
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:55,704
Nicola is here for the role
of Simone's sister.

1271
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:58,915
Viktor.

1272
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:04,963
So much has happened since
we last saw each other.

1273
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:07,299
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1274
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:09,301
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.

1275
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:15,974
I never got a chance
to properly apologize

1276
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:17,726
for what happened
on "Sunrise."

1277
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:20,687
Oh, that's okay.
I know. I understand.

1278
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:24,983
When I saw what Simone
did with the role,

1279
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:28,653
I mean,
I fired all my people.

1280
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:30,280
I went into rehab.

1281
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:31,740
I took some acting classes.

1282
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,950
I changed my whole look.

1283
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:37,370
She really,
really inspired me.

1284
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,335
Would you like me
to read?

1285
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:46,797
Oh, sure.
That would be good.

1286
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,739
Who do you think
you are, Carlos,

1287
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,908
coming in here
like this?

1288
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:19,579
My husband's sleeping
in the next room.

1289
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:22,290
You think
I won't call out?

1290
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:24,292
Do you think
I'll just...

1291
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,128
give in to you
without a fight,

1292
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:28,964
Iike I did the last time
and the time before that?

1293
01:16:37,889 --> 01:16:39,641
I wish you were dead.

1294
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:54,406
I wish we were both dead.

1295
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:03,623
Oh...

1296
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:06,918
that was just wonderful.

1297
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:08,712
Wonderful acting.

1298
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,922
Thank you.

1299
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:12,758
You could play the lead.

1300
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:17,137
Isn't that Simone's part?

1301
01:17:19,347 --> 01:17:20,932
Of course.

1302
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:22,851
Of course it is.

1303
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:28,148
You have such
a beautiful line,

1304
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:30,442
right, right there.

1305
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:32,444
It's not a wrinkle,
or anything,

1306
01:17:32,527 --> 01:17:34,154
it's like a dimple.

1307
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:36,281
Right--
when you smile it--

1308
01:17:36,364 --> 01:17:37,949
I was thinking
of incorporating

1309
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:39,993
something like that
in Simone.

1310
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:44,956
Cosmetically altering
Simone to look like me?

1311
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:48,585
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.

1312
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:51,463
That would be crazy.
Yes...

1313
01:17:51,546 --> 01:17:53,131
that would be nuts.

1314
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:59,388
Would you like me to try something
different with this, or do it again?

1315
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:02,391
No, it's fine.

1316
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:05,435
Okay.

1317
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:08,772
Thank you.

1318
01:18:13,693 --> 01:18:15,487
Thank you, Viktor.

1319
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,793
Happy birthday, Lainey.

1320
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:37,968
What do you think?

1321
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:41,471
It's fantastic.

1322
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:46,810
It's what she drove
in "Eternity Forever."

1323
01:18:46,893 --> 01:18:48,812
- I know.
- See?

1324
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:53,233
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.

1325
01:18:53,316 --> 01:18:55,736
You know,
you won't be able

1326
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:57,571
to drive it till you get
your permit,

1327
01:18:57,612 --> 01:19:00,073
but you can take it around
the lot, okay?

1328
01:19:00,157 --> 01:19:01,700
Here.

1329
01:19:04,453 --> 01:19:06,747
What's the matter?

1330
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,915
I can't accept it.

1331
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,420
Why?
Why, honey?

1332
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:15,422
I don't want a car, Dad.

1333
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:17,215
What do you want?

1334
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:20,886
I'll give you
whatever you want.

1335
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:24,931
The old Viktor Taransky.

1336
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:30,896
I can't stand
to see you like this,

1337
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:34,107
clinging to Simone's
coattails.

1338
01:19:36,193 --> 01:19:37,736
It used to be
all about the work

1339
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,446
and now it's all about her.

1340
01:19:40,822 --> 01:19:43,784
And then she's not even grateful
enough to thank you.

1341
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,285
Oh, no, that was me.

1342
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:47,788
There you go again,
blaming yourself.

1343
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:51,083
Can't you see
what she's done to you?

1344
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:56,713
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.

1345
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:58,799
You deserve better
than Simone.

1346
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:04,930
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.

1347
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:36,670
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.

1348
01:20:36,711 --> 01:20:38,296
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1349
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,507
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.

1350
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:43,593
She told me she wanted to look
at my script next week.

1351
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:45,137
- Jane?
- Gotta go.

1352
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:48,515
I'm leaving early.

1353
01:20:48,598 --> 01:20:51,017
If anybody needs me,
I'll be at the beach house

1354
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:53,145
having dinner
with a certain someone.

1355
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:08,326
Elaine Christian, please.

1356
01:21:53,663 --> 01:21:55,749
Elaine.

1357
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:57,125
Hi.

1358
01:21:58,835 --> 01:22:00,462
Hi.

1359
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:04,466
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.

1360
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:06,635
You don't use
the front door anymore?

1361
01:22:06,676 --> 01:22:08,637
Uh... no.

1362
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:14,476
When is she coming over?

1363
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:18,480
- About now.
- Oh.

1364
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:22,484
Okay. I'll just stay
until she gets here.

1365
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:26,905
Well, she's...

1366
01:22:26,988 --> 01:22:29,157
already here.

1367
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:31,159
What?

1368
01:22:32,702 --> 01:22:34,913
Elaine...

1369
01:22:34,996 --> 01:22:37,457
Simone is not coming
over tonight

1370
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:41,670
or any other night.

1371
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:48,468
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.

1372
01:22:50,887 --> 01:22:52,347
Oh, Viktor!

1373
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:54,099
Wait! Viktor!

1374
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:56,268
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?

1375
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:58,770
I can't compete
with Simone.

1376
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:01,565
- Well...
- What woman can?

1377
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:03,775
I'd rather have you
than Simone.

1378
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:04,776
- Believe me.
- Oh.

1379
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:06,778
That's so sweet.

1380
01:23:08,196 --> 01:23:09,948
No, but I can't
let you do that,

1381
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:12,117
make that kind
of sacrifice.

1382
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,952
- No. No.
- God, this is strange.

1383
01:23:14,035 --> 01:23:16,121
You know, I have stabbed
people in the back

1384
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,957
and clawed and slept
my way to where I am.

1385
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,293
- but--
- You have?

1386
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:23,295
Well, it goes
with the territory.

1387
01:23:23,336 --> 01:23:26,298
For some reason,
I can't betray Simone.

1388
01:23:26,339 --> 01:23:29,301
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.

1389
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,928
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.

1390
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:36,183
You say that now,
but in the morning

1391
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:38,143
you would
go back to her.

1392
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:39,603
- No. No.
- You would, Viktor.

1393
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:42,022
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.

1394
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:44,983
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.

1395
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:46,985
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?

1396
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:48,987
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?

1397
01:23:53,492 --> 01:23:56,620
I'm gonna tell you
a secret now, Elaine.

1398
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:07,798
Simone isn't
a real person.

1399
01:24:12,135 --> 01:24:13,595
I invented her.

1400
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:18,100
Every actor
is an invention.

1401
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:19,893
- Elaine--
- Please.

1402
01:24:19,976 --> 01:24:22,479
You're lucky she's loyal enough
to stay with you.

1403
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:24,523
Maybe she's staying
out of pity.

1404
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:27,275
Who knows? I mean,
she certainly doesn't need you.

1405
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:29,277
Listen,
she's thin air.

1406
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:31,279
- She's pixels.
- What?

1407
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:35,283
Computer code molded by me

1408
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:37,786
from a mathematical equation

1409
01:24:37,869 --> 01:24:41,581
I inherited from a madman.

1410
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:43,667
How much have you had
to drink?

1411
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,460
There's no Simone.

1412
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:47,838
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?!

1413
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:51,717
I've done the impossible.

1414
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:57,723
I have recreated

1415
01:24:57,806 --> 01:25:00,267
the infinite nuances

1416
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:02,269
of a human being--

1417
01:25:02,352 --> 01:25:04,563
a human soul.

1418
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:07,566
I have taken nothing,

1419
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:10,569
and made it something.

1420
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:16,241
I have breathed life
into a machine.

1421
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:20,120
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.

1422
01:25:20,203 --> 01:25:23,415
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.

1423
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:26,084
As God is my judge,
I swear.

1424
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:28,879
I made Simone.
I made her.

1425
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:32,090
- You made Simone?
- Yes.

1426
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:36,011
Viktor...

1427
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:37,929
she made you.

1428
01:25:54,988 --> 01:25:57,074
You bitch.

1429
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:59,034
I'll destroy you.

1430
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:47,040
Bravo!

1431
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:52,879
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1432
01:27:06,977 --> 01:27:08,437
Had a rough night?

1433
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:14,234
Let's see if they still
love you after this.

1434
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:22,576
You made me.

1435
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:24,453
I made you first.

1436
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:28,790
Well, we're back
on "Good Morning, Good Day,"

1437
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:31,752
and we are here once again
with the incomparable Simone.

1438
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,254
Simone, before the break

1439
01:27:34,337 --> 01:27:37,257
you were taking a rather
controversial position.

1440
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,760
I just think
all elementary schools

1441
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:42,304
should have a firing range.

1442
01:27:42,345 --> 01:27:45,348
How else can the children learn
to defend themselves?

1443
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,517
If there is a hole
in the ozone layer,

1444
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:49,644
how come I can't see it?

1445
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:52,105
Immigration? God!

1446
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:53,940
Isn't it crowded enough?

1447
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:56,902
But God created
furry animals to be worn.

1448
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:58,862
Have you ever tasted
dolphin?

1449
01:27:58,945 --> 01:28:01,782
Pan-fried with a little
garlic and fennel.

1450
01:28:01,865 --> 01:28:05,035
Everybody always talks about
the negatives of cigarettes.

1451
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:06,745
But look at the benefits.

1452
01:28:06,828 --> 01:28:08,747
I mean, you don't eat
as much.

1453
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:11,208
And you've got something
to hold in your hand.

1454
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:15,253
We always knew Simone
wasn't like other celebrities.

1455
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:17,047
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.

1456
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,673
She certainly does.

1457
01:28:28,475 --> 01:28:30,394
It's plastic, Hank.

1458
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:33,105
I know that's the way
you'd want it.

1459
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:37,943
She killed you, Hank.

1460
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:39,778
Now she's killing me.

1461
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:43,240
She's a serial killer.

1462
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,078
But I don't know
how to stop her.

1463
01:28:48,161 --> 01:28:52,207
I mean, she's taken on
a life of her own.

1464
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:56,378
I can't just come clean,

1465
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:58,380
you know,
make some confession,

1466
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:00,882
because...

1467
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:04,052
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.

1468
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:08,765
I just can't
put the genie

1469
01:29:08,849 --> 01:29:10,809
back in the bottle,
because...

1470
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:12,894
if she suddenly
stopped working,

1471
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:14,730
you know, just dropped
out of sight,

1472
01:29:14,813 --> 01:29:17,399
they'd never let it rest.

1473
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:22,904
I tried killing
her career,

1474
01:29:25,657 --> 01:29:27,868
but they like her
even more.

1475
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:33,874
What am I gonna do?

1476
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,928
Not another word, Hank.

1477
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,599
You are truly a genius.

1478
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:02,444
Thank you, Hank.

1479
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:05,572
Thank you.

1480
01:30:10,827 --> 01:30:13,455
What's the matter,
Viktor?

1481
01:30:14,539 --> 01:30:16,583
You look so sad.

1482
01:30:18,668 --> 01:30:20,962
Don't you love me anymore?

1483
01:30:25,675 --> 01:30:27,511
It's over, isn't it?

1484
01:30:35,685 --> 01:30:36,645
I know what you're thinking,
Simone.

1485
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:41,983
This is
a phoney-baloney world.

1486
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,822
We're all living
one big lie.

1487
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:48,907
So, why shouldn't
you live, too?

1488
01:30:51,034 --> 01:30:54,413
You're more authentic than
all these people who worship you.

1489
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:56,706
And that's the problem.

1490
01:31:02,003 --> 01:31:04,005
You're looking
at the real fraud.

1491
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,635
I told myself this was
all about the work.

1492
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,679
But if that were the truth,

1493
01:31:10,762 --> 01:31:13,348
it wouldn't matter to me

1494
01:31:13,432 --> 01:31:15,350
that you get
all the attention.

1495
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,980
And it does.

1496
01:31:21,523 --> 01:31:23,442
It does.

1497
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:27,612
I'm sorry, Simone.

1498
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:31,616
Here I was trying
to convince

1499
01:31:31,658 --> 01:31:34,077
the whole world
you existed.

1500
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:36,288
but what I was really
trying to do

1501
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,499
was convince them
that I exist.

1502
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:45,130
It's not that
you aren't human.

1503
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:49,468
It's that I am.

1504
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:14,404
I'm sorry, Simone.

1505
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:43,600
It is my sad...

1506
01:34:43,683 --> 01:34:46,436
and solemn duty...

1507
01:34:48,021 --> 01:34:50,107
to announce...

1508
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:53,527
the tragic passing
of Simone.

1509
01:34:58,657 --> 01:35:00,075
How did she die?

1510
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:03,703
It was a rare virus
she contracted

1511
01:35:04,955 --> 01:35:07,290
on her Goodwill Tour
of the third world.

1512
01:35:10,168 --> 01:35:11,753
Did she suffer?

1513
01:35:11,837 --> 01:35:14,840
Mercifully, it was quick.

1514
01:36:07,309 --> 01:36:09,394
I feel awful.

1515
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:12,689
It's a great loss.

1516
01:36:17,736 --> 01:36:20,447
You know, we're going to
have to restructure your deal.

1517
01:36:22,616 --> 01:36:25,243
Can I see you later?

1518
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:27,913
I mean, go away
for the weekend?

1519
01:36:29,206 --> 01:36:32,209
How could you bring that up
at a time like this?

1520
01:36:52,938 --> 01:36:54,689
One minute, Mr. Taransky.

1521
01:37:00,112 --> 01:37:01,988
Oh my God.

1522
01:37:04,282 --> 01:37:05,867
This has got to be a mistake.

1523
01:37:05,951 --> 01:37:07,702
You have the right
to remain silent.

1524
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:11,164
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1525
01:37:11,206 --> 01:37:12,749
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!

1526
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:15,836
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.

1527
01:37:15,919 --> 01:37:17,045
Dad!

1528
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:19,047
Elaine, call Bernard!

1529
01:37:19,089 --> 01:37:21,091
That's why
it was so light.

1530
01:37:21,133 --> 01:37:23,510
I heard him say,

1531
01:37:23,552 --> 01:37:27,723
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."

1532
01:37:29,683 --> 01:37:31,727
It was so strange.

1533
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:34,730
He actually wanted
to replace Simone with me

1534
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:36,732
in his new movie.

1535
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:40,527
He's a sick man.

1536
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:44,072
He was a controlling madman.

1537
01:37:44,156 --> 01:37:46,074
She was a prisoner.

1538
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:49,911
I blame myself.

1539
01:37:49,995 --> 01:37:53,039
I wish I had done more
to stop it.

1540
01:37:55,751 --> 01:37:57,335
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.

1541
01:37:57,419 --> 01:37:59,921
I'm just trying
to understand here.

1542
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:02,299
Now, all these films

1543
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:05,343
and TV appearances
and magazine covers

1544
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:07,471
and internet interviews,

1545
01:38:07,554 --> 01:38:10,849
publicity photos,
snapshots from her childhood...

1546
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,561
All fake? Hmm?

1547
01:38:14,644 --> 01:38:16,980
This is fake.
This is fake.

1548
01:38:17,064 --> 01:38:19,024
Fake, fake, fake,
fake, fake.

1549
01:38:19,066 --> 01:38:21,568
- All fake?
- Yes.

1550
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:23,695
You understand perfectly.

1551
01:38:23,779 --> 01:38:26,656
So, I will confess

1552
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:29,576
to fraud
but not to murder.

1553
01:38:29,659 --> 01:38:31,995
And a fan club
with a worldwide membership

1554
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:34,873
in the millions,
that's also bogus?

1555
01:38:34,956 --> 01:38:38,543
No. No.
The fan club's real.

1556
01:38:38,627 --> 01:38:40,796
It's just what
they were worshipping

1557
01:38:40,879 --> 01:38:43,215
is a computer code.

1558
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:45,217
Ones and zeroes.

1559
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,053
You couldn't have killed Simone
because there was no Simone.

1560
01:38:48,678 --> 01:38:50,305
- Right. Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno

1561
01:38:50,347 --> 01:38:52,099
that you keep
talking about,

1562
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:55,977
the renowned failure who also
happens to be so conveniently dead,

1563
01:38:56,103 --> 01:38:59,356
now, perhaps this man
that you claim helped invent Simone,

1564
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:02,025
is an invention himself.

1565
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:03,985
Oh, no. No.

1566
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:06,530
This whole thing is insane!

1567
01:39:06,571 --> 01:39:08,031
There is no Simone!

1568
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:10,575
Look.
Even her name is fake.

1569
01:39:10,617 --> 01:39:12,536
It's not Simone.

1570
01:39:12,577 --> 01:39:15,705
It's "Sim One"-- See?

1571
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:17,707
"Simulation One"!

1572
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:19,543
It's a computer code!

1573
01:39:22,087 --> 01:39:24,214
You really hated her,
didn't you?

1574
01:39:26,758 --> 01:39:30,220
Perhaps you could explain
this to me, Mr. Taransky.

1575
01:39:30,303 --> 01:39:33,432
Or is this tape doctored, too?

1576
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:36,560
This is footage from the marina's
closed-circuit camera

1577
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:40,397
on the night in question--
altered of course.

1578
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:42,816
Can you tell us
why you're disposing

1579
01:39:42,899 --> 01:39:45,193
of the body of a woman
who doesn't exist?

1580
01:39:45,277 --> 01:39:47,237
Well, it's not her body.

1581
01:39:48,447 --> 01:39:51,700
It's her body of work.

1582
01:39:51,783 --> 01:39:53,660
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.

1583
01:39:53,744 --> 01:39:55,245
Viktor.

1584
01:39:55,328 --> 01:39:58,498
I know. Look.
Look. Look.

1585
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:02,586
Why don't you just
come clean? Huh?

1586
01:40:02,669 --> 01:40:06,131
Just tell the truth,
you're gonna feel better afterwards.

1587
01:40:06,214 --> 01:40:08,717
I'm telling the truth,
and I don't feel so good.

1588
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,261
Hey, we all know
what happened.

1589
01:40:11,344 --> 01:40:13,430
In a fit of jealous rage,

1590
01:40:13,513 --> 01:40:17,225
you killed Simone and you dumped
her body off the boat...

1591
01:40:17,309 --> 01:40:20,103
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.

1592
01:40:20,187 --> 01:40:21,938
I did--
I can prove--

1593
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:23,398
I can prove it
to you.

1594
01:40:23,482 --> 01:40:25,108
Let me just
take you there.

1595
01:40:25,192 --> 01:40:26,777
I'll take you
to the spot.

1596
01:40:26,818 --> 01:40:28,195
I can prove it.

1597
01:40:28,236 --> 01:40:29,780
Here. Here.
Come on.

1598
01:40:29,863 --> 01:40:31,281
We can just go there,
can't we?

1599
01:40:31,364 --> 01:40:33,950
- Let's just go. I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.

1600
01:40:44,753 --> 01:40:46,463
Okay, good.

1601
01:40:46,546 --> 01:40:48,632
Thank you.
Good work.

1602
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:52,219
Now you'll see.

1603
01:40:57,974 --> 01:41:00,018
What is this?

1604
01:41:00,102 --> 01:41:02,562
No, there's drives
and discs.

1605
01:41:04,147 --> 01:41:05,607
Where are the discs?

1606
01:41:05,649 --> 01:41:07,567
You have to go back down
and get them.

1607
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:10,070
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.

1608
01:41:10,112 --> 01:41:12,364
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!

1609
01:41:12,447 --> 01:41:14,116
- Please! Just--
- Sit him down.

1610
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:16,076
You must go down
and get the drives.

1611
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:18,078
Hey, you see what's
down there?

1612
01:41:24,793 --> 01:41:26,420
Plead guilty.

1613
01:41:26,503 --> 01:41:28,088
Plead guilty
and throw yourself

1614
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:29,631
on the mercy
of the court.

1615
01:41:29,673 --> 01:41:31,425
It's the best deal
you're gonna get.

1616
01:41:31,508 --> 01:41:33,552
I could get
the death penalty.

1617
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:35,095
Yeah. Yeah.

1618
01:41:35,178 --> 01:41:37,180
You certainly will
if you go to trial.

1619
01:41:37,264 --> 01:41:40,392
A jury, in this kind
of ugly mood.

1620
01:41:40,475 --> 01:41:42,769
You killed an icon,
for God's sake.

1621
01:41:42,853 --> 01:41:44,771
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!

1622
01:41:44,855 --> 01:41:48,400
Bernard,
I didn't kill anyone.

1623
01:41:48,483 --> 01:41:50,444
Viktor, come on,
it's in the paper.

1624
01:41:50,527 --> 01:41:52,195
There's no one to kill.

1625
01:41:54,114 --> 01:41:56,908
Bernard,
I'm a filmmaker.

1626
01:41:57,951 --> 01:42:00,036
I was trying
to say something.

1627
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,039
I wanted recognition.

1628
01:42:03,123 --> 01:42:05,584
I wanted
to be appreciated.

1629
01:42:06,793 --> 01:42:09,671
So I created her.

1630
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:13,550
Bernard,
there's no one to kill.

1631
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:16,344
Do you understand?

1632
01:42:17,804 --> 01:42:19,681
An insanity defense.

1633
01:42:22,225 --> 01:42:23,727
Beautiful.

1634
01:42:25,145 --> 01:42:27,606
Fantastic.

1635
01:42:27,689 --> 01:42:30,108
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."

1636
01:42:31,276 --> 01:42:32,944
Viktor! Jesus!

1637
01:42:34,654 --> 01:42:36,406
Jesus Christ, Viktor!

1638
01:42:37,657 --> 01:42:40,202
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?

1639
01:42:41,661 --> 01:42:43,622
- Get me out!
- Viktor!

1640
01:42:43,663 --> 01:42:46,041
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!

1641
01:42:50,504 --> 01:42:52,381
Why can't people just
take responsibility

1642
01:42:52,464 --> 01:42:53,840
for their actions
anymore, huh?

1643
01:42:55,759 --> 01:42:58,512
You know, I can almost
forgive him for killing her.

1644
01:43:00,138 --> 01:43:02,516
But, to deny her existence?

1645
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:06,353
I can never forgive that.

1646
01:43:06,436 --> 01:43:09,189
Because obviously
she existed, right?

1647
01:43:09,272 --> 01:43:12,484
I know it just as surely
as you're sitting there.

1648
01:43:14,111 --> 01:43:16,405
She was the most
vital woman I ever met.

1649
01:43:16,488 --> 01:43:18,031
So you did meet her?

1650
01:43:18,115 --> 01:43:20,200
Yeah, Lainey,
what are you getting at?

1651
01:43:20,283 --> 01:43:21,868
I'm the head
of a major studio.

1652
01:43:21,952 --> 01:43:24,413
Do you think I'm gonna make
a three-picture deal

1653
01:43:24,496 --> 01:43:25,789
with an actress
I never met?

1654
01:43:25,872 --> 01:43:27,040
No. No.

1655
01:43:27,124 --> 01:43:30,711
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.

1656
01:43:33,422 --> 01:43:35,340
I know it's embarrassing
to admit it,

1657
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:39,845
but when I think about it
honestly, I haven't.

1658
01:43:39,928 --> 01:43:41,930
I've never really seen
Simone up close...

1659
01:43:42,013 --> 01:43:43,765
touched her.

1660
01:43:43,849 --> 01:43:46,601
Been in her physical presence.

1661
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:48,478
Have you?

1662
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:48,478
Have you?

1663
01:43:50,647 --> 01:43:51,940
Well--

1664
01:43:50,647 --> 01:43:51,940
Well--

1665
01:43:52,023 --> 01:43:53,817
we don't want
to believe daddy

1666
01:43:52,023 --> 01:43:53,817
we don't want
to believe daddy

1667
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:56,862
because we don't want to believe
that we were taken in too.

1668
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:56,862
because we don't want to believe
that we were taken in too.

1669
01:43:57,946 --> 01:43:59,156
But, Lainey,

1670
01:43:57,946 --> 01:43:59,156
But, Lainey,

1671
01:44:01,616 --> 01:44:04,870
there's no evidence
that Simone isn't real.

1672
01:44:01,616 --> 01:44:04,870
there's no evidence
that Simone isn't real.

1673
01:44:04,911 --> 01:44:06,788
Listen to what
you're saying, Mom.

1674
01:44:04,911 --> 01:44:06,788
Listen to what
you're saying, Mom.

1675
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:09,207
I mean, is there
any evidence that she is?

1676
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:09,207
I mean, is there
any evidence that she is?

1677
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:18,383
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1678
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:18,383
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1679
01:44:26,475 --> 01:44:27,601
What's that?

1680
01:44:26,475 --> 01:44:27,601
What's that?

1681
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:30,896
One part of Dad's story
may have been true.

1682
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:30,896
One part of Dad's story
may have been true.

1683
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:33,231
Simone may have
contracted a virus.

1684
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:33,231
Simone may have
contracted a virus.

1685
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:37,694
Certain viruses
can be cured.

1686
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:37,694
Certain viruses
can be cured.

1687
01:44:40,614 --> 01:44:42,699
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1688
01:44:40,614 --> 01:44:42,699
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1689
01:44:59,925 --> 01:45:01,510
Listen to me.

1690
01:44:59,925 --> 01:45:01,510
Listen to me.

1691
01:45:01,593 --> 01:45:04,054
There's a psychiatrist
in Ventura,

1692
01:45:01,593 --> 01:45:04,054
There's a psychiatrist
in Ventura,

1693
01:45:04,096 --> 01:45:06,515
well-respected,
who is willing to testify

1694
01:45:04,096 --> 01:45:06,515
well-respected,
who is willing to testify

1695
01:45:06,598 --> 01:45:10,060
under oath that you have
diminished capacity

1696
01:45:06,598 --> 01:45:10,060
under oath that you have
diminished capacity

1697
01:45:11,269 --> 01:45:13,438
due to the trauma
of your divorce,

1698
01:45:11,269 --> 01:45:13,438
due to the trauma
of your divorce,

1699
01:45:13,522 --> 01:45:16,983
10 years of abject failure
in the movie business

1700
01:45:13,522 --> 01:45:16,983
10 years of abject failure
in the movie business

1701
01:45:17,067 --> 01:45:19,945
and a bump on the head

1702
01:45:17,067 --> 01:45:19,945
and a bump on the head

1703
01:45:19,986 --> 01:45:21,488
you sustained as a child.

1704
01:45:19,986 --> 01:45:21,488
you sustained as a child.

1705
01:45:21,571 --> 01:45:23,990
No more.

1706
01:45:21,571 --> 01:45:23,990
No more.

1707
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:27,202
I can't go along
with this horseshit.

1708
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:27,202
I can't go along
with this horseshit.

1709
01:45:27,285 --> 01:45:29,579
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.

1710
01:45:27,285 --> 01:45:29,579
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.

1711
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:31,206
No. No.
Viktor, come on.

1712
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:31,206
No. No.
Viktor, come on.

1713
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:34,042
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.

1714
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:34,042
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.

1715
01:45:35,794 --> 01:45:37,713
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.

1716
01:45:35,794 --> 01:45:37,713
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.

1717
01:45:37,796 --> 01:45:39,715
It was premeditated!

1718
01:45:37,796 --> 01:45:39,715
It was premeditated!

1719
01:45:39,798 --> 01:45:42,718
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.

1720
01:45:39,798 --> 01:45:42,718
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.

1721
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:46,096
I bludgeoned her!

1722
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:46,096
I bludgeoned her!

1723
01:45:46,138 --> 01:45:48,390
I set her on fire

1724
01:45:46,138 --> 01:45:48,390
I set her on fire

1725
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:51,101
and then I killed her!

1726
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:51,101
and then I killed her!

1727
01:45:51,143 --> 01:45:54,020
- I did it!
- Excuse me.

1728
01:45:51,143 --> 01:45:54,020
- I did it!
- Excuse me.

1729
01:45:54,062 --> 01:45:56,356
I think you better
see this.

1730
01:45:54,062 --> 01:45:56,356

01:46:55,374 --> 01:46:57,417
Oh, Viktor.

1750
01:46:55,374 --> 01:46:57,417
Oh, Viktor.

1751
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,127
Oh, honey.

1752
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,127
Oh, honey.

1753
01:47:02,589 --> 01:47:05,342
I don't know what you did
or how you did it,

1754
01:47:02,589 --> 01:47:05,342
I don't know what you did
or how you did it,

1755
01:47:05,425 --> 01:47:07,719
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.

1756
01:47:05,425 --> 01:47:07,719
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.

1757
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:09,679
But don't thank us
too fast.

1758
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:09,679
But don't thank us
too fast.

1759
01:47:09,763 --> 01:47:11,681
You know what we have
to do now.

1760
01:47:09,763 --> 01:47:11,681
You know what we have
to do now.

1761
01:47:11,765 --> 01:47:13,183
What?

1762
01:47:11,765 --> 01:47:13,183
What?

1763
01:47:13,225 --> 01:47:15,519
Well, why stop
at one character

1764
01:47:13,225 --> 01:47:15,519
Well, why stop
at one character

1765
01:47:15,602 --> 01:47:17,854
when you can have
a whole cast?

1766
01:47:15,602 --> 01:47:17,854
when you can have
a whole cast?

1767
01:47:17,938 --> 01:47:20,065
You have to finish
what you started.

1768
01:47:17,938 --> 01:47:20,065
You have to finish
what you started.

1769
01:47:20,148 --> 01:47:22,067
We can do it together.

1770
01:47:20,148 --> 01:47:22,067
We can do it together.

1771
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:25,153
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?

1772
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:25,153
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?

1773
01:47:25,237 --> 01:47:27,072
Where we going?

1774
01:47:25,237 --> 01:47:27,072
Where we going?

1775
01:47:27,114 --> 01:47:29,366
Well, I was thinking...

1776
01:47:27,114 --> 01:47:29,366
Well, I was thinking...

1777
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:31,535
how about you and Simone,

1778
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:31,535
how about you and Simone,

1779
01:47:31,576 --> 01:47:33,537
moving in with me and Lainey?

1780
01:47:31,576 --> 01:47:33,537
moving in with me and Lainey?

1781
01:47:38,959 --> 01:47:40,377
That's wonderful.

1782
01:47:38,959 --> 01:47:40,377
That's wonderful.

1783
01:47:41,712 --> 01:47:43,338
What do you think, Lainey?

1784
01:47:41,712 --> 01:47:43,338
What do you think, Lainey?

1785
01:47:43,422 --> 01:47:45,006
About you and Mom?

1786
01:47:43,422 --> 01:47:45,006
About you and Mom?

1787
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:48,593
Well, about me and Simone.

1788
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:48,593
Well, about me and Simone.

1789
01:47:48,677 --> 01:47:50,804
What I did.

1790
01:47:48,677 --> 01:47:50,804
What I did.

1791
01:47:50,887 --> 01:47:52,431
Everything.
I'm sorry.

1792
01:47:50,887 --> 01:47:52,431
Everything.
I'm sorry.

1793
01:47:52,514 --> 01:47:55,642
Your mistake wasn't
making something fake, Dad.

1794
01:47:52,514 --> 01:47:55,642
Your mistake wasn't
making something fake, Dad.

1795
01:47:55,726 --> 01:47:57,602
We're fine with fake.

1796
01:47:55,726 --> 01:47:57,602
We're fine with fake.

1797
01:47:57,686 --> 01:47:59,771
As long as you don't lie
about it.

1798
01:47:57,686 --> 01:47:59,771
As long as you don't lie
about it.

1799
01:48:04,568 --> 01:48:06,194
Oh, come on, Viktor.

1800
01:48:04,568 --> 01:48:06,194
Oh, come on, Viktor.

1801
01:48:06,278 --> 01:48:08,280
It's not
a death sentence.

1802
01:48:06,278 --> 01:48:08,280
It's not
a death sentence.

1803
01:48:09,614 --> 01:48:12,367
No. It's life.

1804
01:48:09,614 --> 01:48:12,367
No. It's life.

1805
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:22,669
Hey, Viktor,
remember us?

1806
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:22,669
Hey, Viktor,
remember us?

1807
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:25,047
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.

1808
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:25,047
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.

1809
01:48:25,088 --> 01:48:27,883
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.

1810
01:48:25,088 --> 01:48:27,883
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.

1811
01:48:27,924 --> 01:48:30,343
- Hi!
- It's life.

1812
01:48:27,924 --> 01:48:30,343
- Hi!
- It's life.

1813
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:37,517
Just call.
Five minutes.

1814
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:37,517
Just call.
Five minutes.

1815
01:48:37,601 --> 01:48:39,061
All we need
is five minutes.

1816
01:48:37,601 --> 01:48:39,061
All we need
is five minutes.

1817
01:48:52,866 --> 01:48:55,327
Good evening,
and welcome.

1818
01:48:52,866 --> 01:48:55,327
Good evening,
and welcome.

1819
01:48:56,703 --> 01:48:58,663
Simone, the question

1820
01:48:56,703 --> 01:48:58,663
Simone, the question

1821
01:48:58,705 --> 01:49:03,001
on everybody's mind
is simply... why?

1822
01:48:58,705 --> 01:49:03,001
on everybody's mind
is simply... why?

1823
01:49:03,085 --> 01:49:05,170
Frank, you know
as well as I do,

1824
01:49:03,085 --> 01:49:05,170
Frank, you know
as well as I do,

1825
01:49:05,212 --> 01:49:07,297
Iiving in this fish-bowl,

1826
01:49:05,212 --> 01:49:07,297
Iiving in this fish-bowl,

1827
01:49:07,381 --> 01:49:10,008
the insatiable appetite
of the media,

1828
01:49:07,381 --> 01:49:10,008
the insatiable appetite
of the media,

1829
01:49:10,092 --> 01:49:12,511
with everything
that was going on in my life,

1830
01:49:10,092 --> 01:49:12,511
with everything
that was going on in my life,

1831
01:49:12,552 --> 01:49:15,347
I just needed to drop out
of sight for a while.

1832
01:49:12,552 --> 01:49:15,347
I ju

1833
01:49:15,389 --> 01:49:19,351
I needed time,
and Viktor bought me that time.

1834
01:49:19,393 --> 01:49:22,813
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.

1835
01:49:24,731 --> 01:49:26,650
But now I understand
you're eager

1836
01:49:26,691 --> 01:49:28,360
to get back to work

1837
01:49:28,443 --> 01:49:30,195
and it's not the kind
of work

1838
01:49:30,278 --> 01:49:32,531
we were all expecting.

1839
01:49:32,572 --> 01:49:34,199
It's true.

1840
01:49:34,282 --> 01:49:38,620
I can reveal I am considering
a career in politics.

1841
01:49:38,703 --> 01:49:41,248
And what, may I ask,
brought this on?

1842
01:49:43,959 --> 01:49:47,504
I suppose this little man
had something to do with it.

1843
01:49:47,587 --> 01:49:50,173
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.

1844
01:49:50,257 --> 01:49:53,135
You see, Viktor and I
are both very concerned

1845
01:49:53,176 --> 01:49:55,554
about what kind of world
our new son, Chip,

1846
01:49:55,637 --> 01:49:57,389
is going to grow up in.

1847
01:49:58,807 --> 01:50:00,559
Aren't you, Viktor?

1848
01:50:00,642 --> 01:50:02,394
Oh, yes.

1849
01:50:03,645 --> 01:50:05,230
Hi.

1850
01:50:08,275 --> 01:50:10,235
Oh yes.

1851
01:50:22,289 --> 01:50:24,374
# Looking out #

1852
01:50:24,458 --> 01:50:28,045
# On the morning rain #

1853
01:50:28,128 --> 01:50:32,174
# I used to feel
so inspired #

1854
01:50:34,843 --> 01:50:38,764
# And when I knew
I had to face another day #

1855
01:50:40,974 --> 01:50:44,603
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #

1856
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:49,649
# Before the day I met you #

1857
01:50:49,733 --> 01:50:52,861
# Life was so unkind #

1858
01:50:52,944 --> 01:50:57,407
# You're the key
to my peace of mind #

1859
01:50:57,407 --> 01:51:01,036
# 'Cause you make me feel #

1860
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:04,247
# You make me feel #

1861
01:51:04,289 --> 01:51:10,462
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

1862
01:51:13,799 --> 01:51:17,719
# When my soul was
in the lost and found #

1863
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:23,683
# You came along to claim it #

1864
01:51:26,311 --> 01:51:32,234
# And didn't know
what was wrong with me #

1865
01:51:32,317 --> 01:51:36,196
# Till your kiss helped me name it #

1866
01:51:38,407 --> 01:51:41,368
# Now I'm no longer
doubtful #

1867
01:51:41,451 --> 01:51:44,246
# To what I'm living for #

1868
01:51:44,287 --> 01:51:46,331
# And if I make you happy #

1869
01:51:46,415 --> 01:51:48,959
# I don't need to do more #

1870
01:51:49,042 --> 01:51:52,587
# 'Cause you make me feel #

1871
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:55,590
# You make me feel #

1872
01:51:55,674 --> 01:52:02,180
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

1873
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:04,725
# Woman #

1874
01:52:04,766 --> 01:52:08,395
# Oh, baby, what you've done to me #

1875
01:52:08,478 --> 01:52:10,397
# Done to me #

1876
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:14,985
# You make me feel
so good inside #

1877
01:52:15,026 --> 01:52:17,571
# Good inside #

1878
01:52:17,654 --> 01:52:21,616
# And I just wanna be #

1879
01:52:21,658 --> 01:52:23,535
# Wanna be #

1880
01:52:23,618 --> 01:52:27,497
# Close to you,
you make me feel so alive #

1881
01:52:27,539 --> 01:52:30,542
# 'Cause you make me feel #

1882
01:52:30,584 --> 01:52:34,212
# You make me feel #

1883
01:52:34,296 --> 01:52:40,761
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

1884
01:52:40,802 --> 01:52:43,430
# You make me feel #

1885
01:52:43,513 --> 01:52:46,975
# You make me feel #

1886
01:52:47,059 --> 01:52:53,690
# You make me feel
like a real... #

1887
01:52:55,442 --> 01:52:58,653
# You make me feel #

1888
01:52:58,695 --> 01:53:01,823
# Feel like a real... #

1889
01:53:01,907 --> 01:53:07,162
# You make me feel
like a real... #

1890
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:09,988
She likes
chicken pot pie...

1891
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:12,157
just like me.
